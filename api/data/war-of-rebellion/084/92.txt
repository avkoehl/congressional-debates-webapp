FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 8, 1864.

General FISK:

SIR: Weston is in imminent danger. Can you give us immediate held? If not, permit General Curtis to do so. Reply immediately.

A. G. BELLER,

Mayor.

GLASGOW, July 8, 1864.

General FISK:

By message just received from Leavenworth I learn that the whole movement is waiting for your request for General Curtis to co-operate with his troops. This is merely the statement of operator at Fort Leavenworth. The operator at Kansas City says Colonel Ford is all ready to start as soon as plan is agreed upon. Line having been down has delayed them all this afternoon.

BANCROFT,

Operator.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 8, 1864.

Captain HOLLOWAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A sufficient force has been sent to Weston to protect it and will be retained there to-morrow, and longer if necessary.

S. S. CURTIS,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, KANS., July 8, 1864.

General ROSECRANS:

My commander at Fort Scott reports Marchbanks and Taylor with about 200 rebel recruits scattered in small bands, generally on Clear Creek and the Montevallo country; also Major Pickler, with about 300 more, south of Fort Scott. These rebels report that Shelby and Jackman are in Northern Arkansas; if so, these recruits are for that command. Please notify General Brown. The taking of Parkville yesterday by bushwhackers increases the apprehension in the border counties.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, July 8, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS,

Fort Leavenworth:

Thanks for your information. We must plan a concentrated movement to use these rascals up. I wish, if possible, to prearrange the provisional militia on the basis of General Orders, Numbers 107, for local defense before it. I will let you know more soon.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
