Adjutant and Inspector General:

GENERAL: On being so ordered I repaired at once to Montgomery and relieved General Stephen D. Lee of command of this department. I found the whole available force of the department to be as follows: In North Mississippi, about 6,000 cavalry; in Central Alabama, about 1,400 cavalry; in front of Vicksburg, about 700 cavalry; in Southwest MISSISSIPPI and East Louisiana, about 1,200 cavalry. I took active measures to provide for repair of railroad from Montgomery to Opelika, and to guard the approaches through North Alabama against raids on that line of road
