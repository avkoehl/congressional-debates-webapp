much. There is no forage in this country between Stevenson and this place. Our trains are scattered all along the road, and without forage.

I hope soon to have some forage, and will act and work with all energy possible.

Very respectfully,

JOHN A. LOGAN,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, Tennessee,

Major General U. S. GRANT,

The two weeks are up to-day. Crook has reached Pulaski, and my regiments that are here are moving this morning. I go to Columbia by rail tomorrow.

Brigadier General GEORGE CROOK,

Commanding Second Division Cavalry:

I will go by rail to Columbia tomorrow and join you as soon as I can. Dodge telegraphs that he will let you have all the stock he can spare. The regiments that left here this morning are directed to sweep the country and get all the horses they can find for you. Your command will soon return. You can have the transportation you suggest. Draw what rations you can conveniently carry with you at Pulaski, if possible.

W. SOOY SMITH,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Cavalry.

COLLIERVILLE, December 27, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

The pickets sent out this morning contradict the first report of the enemy crossing, but state that a small party crossed from the south. There is no sign of the enemy now on Wolf. A negro escaped from Forrest at Somerville yesterday and came into our lines. He states that Forrest has about 4,000 men, half of them conscripts and unarmed; that they talk of going to Okolona, and that they were moving in this direction when he escaped.

W. P. CALLON,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.

General HURLBUT:

Couriers just in from the force sent toward La Fayette report that the enemy is driving our men back and within 3 miles of this place.

W. P. CALLON,

Lieutenant And Aide-de-Camp.
