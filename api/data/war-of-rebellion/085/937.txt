Colonel LOGAN,

Commanding at Princeton:

COLONEL: Your communication received announcing that you have direct information that Grierson's command is marching in the direction of White River. The major-general commanding desires to have by return courier all particulars concerning this matter, with statement of manner in which this information reached you. How did you learn it, when and where, and from whom.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. P. TURNER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS,Camden, September 16, 1864.

Major-General CHURCHILL,

Commanding, &amp;c., Monticello:

GENERAL: I am instructed by Major-General Magruder to say that Major-General Wharton is expected here, and in his absence you will assume command of all the troops and inform this office where they are stationed. Please send the field returns which are called for of the cavalry regiments, brigades, and divisions as soon as received. Where it is desirable to have regiments at detached posts they should be as near their brigades as possible. The major-general wishes you to keep your scouts well out toward Pine Bluff, and wishes you to get all information of that place you can, whether re-enforced, and by how many, with what kind of works are armed, whether there is talk of a raid of forward movement, what re-enforcements of cavalry have been received. Information of an undoubted character has been received from General Smith that the enemy's force, which landed at mouth of White River, came from Morganza, were composed of infantry, cavalry, and artillery to the number of 7,000 or 8,000 men, at least tow regiments of cavalry being with them-one First Kansas, the other Eighty-seventh Illinois. Perhaps there may be more cavalry. The general would wish to see Doctor Barry here, if he is still at Monticello, and can be spared so long from his post. When will General Thompson be here?

I am, general very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. P. TURNER.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
