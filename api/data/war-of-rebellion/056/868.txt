This order is given in view of information as to the state of things at New Orleans and the forts below. Let General Adams' orders be discretionary, and direct him to report frequently. Send a copy of this order over to General Taylor.

By order of Lieutenant-General Polk:

T. M. JACK.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MONTGOMERY, ALA., December 25, 1863.

Hon. J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

From the character of the organization under General Pillow, its extent, and the large amount of funds that are required to pay its officers to enable them to continue their labors and the supporting forces, and to adjust with proper vouchers the large amount of funds already expended by lieutenants of the line acting as quartermasters and commissaries at the various rendezvous, his attention for a time seems to me to be indispensable to protect the public interest.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

WEST POINT, GA., December 25, 1863.

Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

I do not know the strength of the Army of Tennessee, nor of General Beauregard's department nor of the enemy at their place. So can from no opinion on the subject of your dispatch of yesterday.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
