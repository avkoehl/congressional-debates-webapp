glad to say that the brigade displayed this attribute of a good soldier as well, if not better, than any in the army, and have reached this point in as good condition and spirits as could be expected.

There were brilliant acts of courage that should be described by the pen of the poet, and severe suffering that should be painted with gloomy shades; but this "unvarnished tale" is sufficient for Shelby's brigade, for its reputation is established.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

M. JEFF. THOMPSON,

Brigadier General, Missouri State Guards, Commanding Shelby's Brigade.

Colonel L. A. MACLEAN, C. S. Army,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Price's Corps, present:

COLONEL: You call upon me for a report of the number of prisoners of war that were captured by my command at Sedalia, Mo., on the 15th of October and paroled by me on that occasion. I have the honor to report that, having no printed paroles with me, and the time not allowing me to write them, I was compelled to take verbal paroles, and, also, as I did not know how it was intended to classify the kinds of troops that were fighting us, and being desirous to make a favorable impression upon the home guards and enrolled militia, I divided the prisoners into three classes, viz, the home guard, of whom there were several hundred; the enrolled militia, of whom there were some seventy-five, and the volunteer militia and regular U. S. Volunteers, of-whom there were forty-seven enlisted men and three commissioned officers, viz, Captain O. B. Queen and Lieutenant R. T. Berry, Company M, Seventh Cavalry, Missouri State Militia; Lieutenant E. Knapp, Seventeenth Illinois Cavalry, U. S. Volunteers. The home guard I released unconditionally and the others
