Hon. CLIFFORD ANDERSON,

Member of Congress from Georgia:

MY DEAR SIR: I have just received the report in the case of Major C. J. Harris, for which I have informed you I had called on the War Department. It is as follows:

Charles J. Harris was appointed by the Secretary of War a major for conscript duty in Georgia, but as he was not appointed to the actual command of a camp of instruction the President declined to nominate, and accordingly at the end of the session (February 17 last) he was notified that he was dropped because not confirmed. He has been notified of the cause and facts of the case.

ED. A. PALFREY,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

By reference to the law you will perceive that the appointment was unauthorized, and therefore, when the case came before me, I decided against it an declined to nominate. There is, and has long been, a necessity for other officers than those allowed by the law. The commandant of a camp cannot perform all the duties required by the act for a general enrollment, but in the absence of legislation for other officers the course pursued in this case was the only one which I could adopt.

Very respectfully and truly, yours,

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
