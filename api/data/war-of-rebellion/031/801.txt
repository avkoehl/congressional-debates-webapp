night at Wolf Run Shoals, together with his whole command, except the First Massachusetts Volunteers, occupying Fairfax Station. He further reports General Sigel's pickets as having been driven in day before yesterday at Bull Run Bridge.

Respectfully,

L. HUNT,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, [W.] VA., November 26, 1862.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Genera-in-Chief:

General Geary has just returned from a reconnaissance toward Charlestown. He was informed that Jackson, with about 30,000 men, left Berryville last Saturday and marched south; that he returned last night to Berryville with his entire command. General Geary thinks this information very reliable. It this statement is true, I think there is some danger that he may cross the river below us and destroy our railroad communications. I have only 50 cavalrymen. Can a regiment from Pennsylvania be sent to us? I have no fears of the capture of this place, unless our supplies are cut off.

H. W. SLOCUM,

Major-General of Volunteers.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, November 26, 1862.

Major General GEORGE W. MORELL,

Hagerstown, Md.:

The Potomac River should be well picket with cavalry.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

RAPPAHANNOCK RIVER, November 26, 1862.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Would it not be well to keep and eye on the present place of obstructions in the river?

Will you communicate with me on the river banks as far down as possible? I expect to reach Port Royal to-morrow. You will judge when to start the supports against the sharpshooters.

E. P. McCREA.

WAR DEPARTMENT, November 26, 1862.

Brigadier-General MORELL,

Hagerstown:

Lieutenant-Colonel Blakely reports that you told him the cavalry under his command were not safe at Hagerstown. Please report immediately to this Department your reasons for such statement, if you made it.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
