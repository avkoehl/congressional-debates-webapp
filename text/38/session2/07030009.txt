the 4th of August. Subsequently, entering the
bay of San Salvador, Brazil,she encountered the
steamer Wachusett, commanded by Commander
Collins, to whom she surrendered, and by whom
she was brought in a leaky and dilapidated con-
dition to Hampton Roads. Here, while at an-
chor, an Army transport came in collision wiih
the shattered vessel, which sunk a few days after
near the wreck of the Cumberland.
The Georgia, another English-built naval ves-
sel which cruised under the rebel flag, repaired to
Cherbourg in February, and thence proceeded to
the Mersey, where she changed owners. Her
armament was removed from her and she left
Liverpool for Lisbon. On the loth of August
Commodore T. T. Craven, of the N'agara, fell
in with her in latitude 39° 1G' north,longitude 9°
39' west, sailing under the English llag. Com-
modore Craven took possession of the vessel as
a lawful prize, and putting a prize ciewon board
of her, he sent her to the United States
The Tallahassee, an English-built blockade
runner from Liverpool, which port she left in the
early part of the spring under the name of the
Atlanta, was engaged in violating the blockade,
running between Bermuda and Wilmington. 1
am not aware that any valid tiansfer of owner-
ship of this vessel has ever taken place, but am
induced to believe she is now, whiie depredating
on our commerce, registered as a British vessel
in the custom-house at Liverpool. Whatever
may be the fact in that particular, this English-
built neutral vessel, which had been previously
engaged in the unneutral employment of carry-
ing supplies to the rebels who are waging war
upon our Government, came out of Wilmington
early in August, armed, officered, and manned
for predatory warfare, and, under the command
of J. T. Wood, formerly of our Navy, com-
menced the piratical work of destroying peaceful
merchant ships, robbing them of money and other
valuables, and retaining as trophies of his hero-
ism the stolen chronometers. Information of die
operations of this vessel reached the Department
on the 12th of August, and orders were immedi-
ately sent for all the available vessels within con-
venient distance to start at once in pursuit. Sev-
eral vessels proceeded to sea that evening, and
within forty-eight hours sixteen vessels from
New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Newport,and
Hampton Roads were in search of her. Butshe
reached Halifax m safety. Instead of remaining
there nine days getting supplies, as did the Flor-
ida at Bermuda, the authorities would permit her
to receive only a limited quantity of coals, and she
was therefore but a short time in that port. The
Pontoosuc arrived in pursuit of her a few hours
after her departure. She was, at last accounts, in
Wilmington.

The,foregoing tabular statement exhibits the
number and description of vessels that have been
constructed, or put in the course of construction
for the Navy since the institution of active meas-
ures for the suppression of the rebellion. Some
of them have been built by contract; others by the
Government, in the several navy-yards. If we
add to the number of those constructed undersim-
ilar circumstances, and within the same period,
that have been lost by shipwreck, in battle, &c.,
namely: the sloops Housatonic and Adirondack,
and the iron-clads Monitor, Weehawken, Keo-
kuk, Indianola, and Tecumseh, the aggregate
would be 210 vessels, 3,675 guns, and 256,755
tons.
Picket boats, and small craft built for especial
purposes, are not embraced in this statement.
CONSTRUCTION OF NAVAL VESSELS.
At the commencement of the rebellion the Navy
consisted of sailing vessels, a few paddle-wheel'
steamers, and screw vessels with auxiliary steam
power. Among the latter, the principal and most
important were the steam frigates, which, on ac-
count of their great draught of water, were un-
suitable for any other purpose than that of cruisers
on foreign stations as flag-ships, for which, indeed,
they were intended. These vessels had been built
to meet the conditions of their day; some of them,
the Mississippi for instance, had been in service
more than twenty years. When constructed the
principal objectin view was armament, not speed,
and they were equal, if not superior, to the ves-
sels of other naval Powers. For attacks on forts,
when accessible to naval attacks, or to protect
troops in landing, they can still render service.
Time was required to repair and place in proper
condition such of these vessels as were disman-
tled, and also those which were recalled from ser-
vice abroad. The sailing men-of-war had become
useless for fighting purposes. In the emergency
that devolved upon it at the beginning of hostili-
ties, the Department resorted to the commercial
marine, and purchased every available merchant
steamer that could advantageously be converted
into a naval vessel, and be used to enforce the
blockade.
The want of a class of small, heavily armed, pro-
peller vessels was felt, and the Department im-
mediately proceeded, on its own responsibility,
and withoutany appropriation orauthorization by
Congress, to contract for the construction of twen-
ty-three gunboats, of which the Unadilla, Pinola,
and Wissahickon may be taken as the type. Some
of these vessels were afloat, armed, and manned
within four months from the date of contract, and
participated in the attack on Port Royal; others
took part on the lower Mississippi in passing the
forts and in capturing New Orleans. These gun-
boats continue to maintain agood reputation, and
their steam machinery gives satisfaction. Well
adapted as they are in guarding our coast, a larger
description was needed for ocean service, and
four vessels of the class of theOssipee, mounting
each two guns of eleven inches, wcie built. There
were also four vessels of slightly less tonnage con-
structed, carrying the same armament, of which
the Kearsarge is the type. The Shenandoah is
the type of six vessels, mounting each three 11-
inch guns, all of which sustain a high reputation.
The heavy guns mentioned constitute the princi-
pal armament of the several classes named, but
they each have in addition from two to six guns
of less caliber. All of these vessels are screw
steamers, suitable for sea cruising; but. for the
shallow sounds and bays, the rivers and bayous,
often narrow and tortuous, another and different
class, drawing less water, was found to be neces-
saiy, and for them competition was invited. To
turn in these frequently restricted channels is dif-
ficult, and sometimes impossible, and the neces-
sities of the case suggesied the principle of a fight-
ing vessel with a double bow and rudder at each
end. Twelve paddle-wheel steamers constructed
on this principle were built, some in the navy-
yards and others by contract. The Port Royal
and the Sonoma are types of this class. Anaddi-
tional number, amounting to twenty-seven, of
these double-bowed paddle-wheel vessels have
been built, almost all of them by contract. The
Sassacus, which was distinguished in the attack
on the rebel ram in Albemarle sound, the Meta-
comet, conspicuous in Mobile bay, and theEutaw,
are types of these vessels. Eight of this class are
