MARTINSBURG, W. VA., September 30, 1864.

(Received 12.20 p. m.)

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

About 300 or 400 guerrillas are operating between Winchester and Bunker Hill. I do not consider my post safe unless I have stronger force to protect the large amount of Government property rapidly accumulating here. I want one regiment of cavalry to operate against these guerrillas. I have no cavalry under my command. I want one or two regiments of infantry.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Washington, September 30, 1864 - 2.50 p. m.

General NEILL,

Martinsburg:

Your telegram has been referred to General Halleck to know what troops, if any, can be sent you. I know of none. You will communicate directly with him on whatever relates to your command.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

MARTINSBURG, September 30, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Commanding:

Captain Shaw, engineer officer, now engaged at North Mountain building block-houses for defense of the road, reports there are no troops at Cherry Run, Back Creek bridge, and North Mountain. I deem it of essential importance to the safety of the railroad, and to cover Captain Shaw's working parties, that those three points should be guarded. As it is within your command, I have sent this information to you.

T. H. NEILL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

MARTINSBURG, September 30, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

The regiment your ordered here has not arrived. When did it start? I want it very much.

T. H. NEILL,

Brigadier-General.
