HDQRS. PROV. ARMY CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA,Charleston, S. C., March 9, 1861.

Honorable L. P. WALKER, Secretary of War, Montgomery, Ala.:

SIR: I inclose you herewith the report of Colonel M. Gregg, First Regiment South Carolina Volunteers, commanding on Morris Island, at the entrance of this harbor, reporting the circumstances connected with the accidental shooting of a loaded gun towards Fort Sumter on the 8th instant. From the inquiries thus far made, it would appear to have been entirely accidental; but I have ordered a thorough investigation of the affair to be made at once, and in order to prevent the recurrence of an event which might be attended with such disastrous consequences, I have ordered that hereafter no gun should be practiced with without first ascertaining whether it be loaded or not.

The channel batteries are progressing regularly, and the other works are being corrected and consolidated. Nothing new otherwise.

I remain, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. G. BEAUREGARD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

[Inclosure.]
HEADQUARTERS MORRIS ISLAND, S. C.,March 8, 1861.

To the CHIEF OF STAFF OF BRIGADIER-GENERAL BEAUREGARD:

SIR: I am informed by Major Stevens that a shot was accidentally fired from the iron battery this morning, which struck Fort Sumter. Major Stevens was practicing with blank cartridges, and does not know how a shot got in. He does not suspect that it was put in by any man intentionally. Major Stevens is about to go with a flag to Fort Sumter to explain the accident.

I have to request that General Beauregard will forward this note for the information of the commander-in-chief.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

MAXCY GREGG,

Colonel First Regiment South Carolina Volunteers,

Commanding on Morris Island.

WASHINGTON, March 11, 1861.

General BEAUREGARD,

Commanding Army Confederate States, Charleston, S. C.:

Believed here that Anderson will be ordered to evacuate Sumter in five days. Was certainly informally agreed on in Cabinet Saturday night. May have been done as ruse to throw you off your guard and enable them to re-enforce.

LOUIS T. WIGFALL.

WASHINGTON, March 11, 1861.

His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS, Montgomery, Ala.:

It is believed here in Black Republican circles that Anderson will be ordered to vacate Fort Sumter in five days. An informal conclusion to this effect was arrived at Saturday night in Cabinet. Anderson telegraphed, it is said, that he had no fuel and but fifteen days' provisions.

LOUIS T. WIGFALL.
