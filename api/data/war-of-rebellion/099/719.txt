All officers and soldiers of this command are reminded thzat the State of North Carolina was one of the last States that passed the ordinance of secession, and that from the commencement of the war there has been in this State a strong Union party. Her action on the question of secession was undoubtedly brought about by the traitorous acts of other States, and by intriguae and dishonesty on the part of her own citizens. The act never even met the approval of the great mass of her people. It should not be assumed that the inhabitants are eneemies to our Government, and it is to be hoped that every effort will be made to prevent any wanton destruction of property, or any unkind treatment of citizens.
