Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
Senate & Ho. op JReps.
on the 1st November, 1837, which was ratified on
15th June, 1838, by which they covenanted to
leave their present i esidences for the neutral ground
west of the Mississippi, within eight months after
the íatification The day will arrive in winter,
and it is understood they wish to be indulged till
spimg, which seems to be not unreasonable,
although the distance to be traveled is short, and
I am sure they will be gratified On the other
hand, information of a different character has
reached this office, stating mat it is uncertain
whether they will remove In any event, I think,
the above request ought to be gianted
The number of Indians on this side of the Mis-
sissippi is comparatively small, and it cannot be
that much time shall elapse before the entire East
country will be relieved of their presence—an
event desuable in all respects of the subject It
is an expensive operation, but it is difficult to with-
hold any draft upon the public funds in reference
to it Our great purpose is their peaceable ard
comfortable translation, and m effectipg it, tie
movement should have a liberal infusion of feeling
and humanity, and not be misshaped by narrow
lules
The different treaties providing for then removal,
and the act of 1830, entitle the Indians to receive
paten's for the land allotted to them in the West
To so many of them as are there, would it not be
just to give the evidence of title' They will look
for it, and would be gratified by its receipt Few
surveys have been made designation of boundary
on the ground might prevent collisions, and is
proper This work shou'd be attended to, I
think
Within the last twelvemonths, the following
treaties, previously made, have been confirmed
and ratified, and appropriations made by Con
gress for cairymg them into effect It is thought
proper to notice them particularly, as having been
acted on lately for the first time
A treaty was concluded with the Miami tribe,
on the 23d October, 1834, which, having been laid
before the Senate with modifications, assented to
by the principal chiefs, that body ratified the same
with a certain amendment "Provided, That the
'chiefs and warriors of the said tribe shall, in gen
'«ral council, as on the occasion of concluding the
'aforesaid treaty, agree to and sign the same "
The amendment was adopted by the Miamies, and
the treaty proclaimed by the Piesident on the 22d
December, 1837 By this contract a considerable
body of land was conveyed to the United States,
for which a fair equivalent in money was stipu-
lated to be paid, viz $208,000, with reservations
of land The United States further agreeing to
have their improvements on the ceded ground
valued, and to expend the amount m building,
clearing, and fencing land for the Indians, on such
place or places as they might afterwards select for
their residence An examination into the debts
of this tribe, for the payment of which $50,000
weieappropnated,isnowin progress The stipu-
lations of the United States m the treaty have been
complied with, so far as the time has arrived for
their performance
With the Chippewas of the Mississippi a treaty
was negotiated on the 29th July, 1837 By it a
cession of land was made to the United States,
and we undertook to pay them in money and
goods, annually, for twenty years, $31,000, to
meet which remittances have been made to the
public agents The-e are also §100 000 to be
paid by the United States to the "half breeds of
the Chippewa nation," under the direction of the
President, and $70,000 to be applied in payment
of their debts, $58,000 to specific claims, and
$12,000 to other just demands against them
Governor Dodge recommends the postponement
until spring of the distribution of the $100,000,
and the allotment to the creditors of the $12,000
The $58,000 might be paid here on drafts of those
entitled, but if necessary to appoint an agent m the
the spring for other purposes mentioned, perhaps
the whole had better be confided to him There
are some minor, and yet important, provisions for
the benefit of the Indians, such as the election of
blacksmiths' shops, the employment of farmers,
and the delivery of agricultural implements, and
gram or seed, &c , which the above gentleman
has been asKed to suggest the most judicious plan
óf carrying it out
Prom the Sioux of the Mississippi a cession of
land was obtained by treaty, concluded at Wash-
ington, in September, 1837    Instead of investing
$300,000, as provided by the treaty, $15,000 were
appropriated to pay the interest, at five per centum
This sum remains in the Treasury, it having been
considered advisable not to pay it over until due
This, for a single reason, is, perhaps, most judi
cious     If the interest is paid in advance, an inter
val of more than a year must occur between such
payment and one that may be made of the inter
est that shall have accumulated on an investment
when convenient to make it, it will be difficult to
explain this to the Indians, and dissatisfaction
might grow out of it     Commissioners have been
appointed to investigate debts and claims of the
" relations and friends of the chiefs and braves "
To the latter, $110,000 have been appropriated
by the treaty, and have been remitted to theproDer
agent, and the sum of $90,000, set apart for the
payment of the just debts of the Sioux, is re
tamed to meet the drafts of the commissioners in
favor of creditors, and until their report is re
ceived     The other stipulations of the treaty have
been complied with, except those which appro-
priate, annually, $8,250 to the purchase of " medi-
' cines, agricultural implements, and stock, and for
•the support of a physician, farmers, and black-
' smiths, and for other beneficial objects,"and bind
the United States to supply the Sioux, as soon as
practicable, with "agricultural implements, me-
' chames' tools, cattle, and such other articles as
' may be useful to them, toan amount not exceeding
'$10,000," to enable them to break up and improve
their lands     The agent has been directed to ex
pend such a portion of the amounts mentioned, as
prudence would warrant, for the objects intended,
and Governor Dodge and he have been requested
to submit a plan for the most beneficial apphca
tion of the said sums
The Sacs and Foxes of the Mississippi ceded,
by the treaty of October 21, 1837, one million two
hundred and fif y thousand acres of land The
survey of the land is now making, at the expense
of the United States, according to a provision of
the treaty A commissioner has been appointed
to examine their debts, and the $100,000 pro-
vided for their liquidation retained until his report
comes in, which, it is understood, may be looked
for very soon Goods to the amount of $28,500
have been delivered to them according to the
treaty, and instiuctions weie given, on the 28th
of August, for the execution of the other stipula
tions foi the current year, except as to the interest
of $200,000, which has not been paid, because not
due In lieu of an investment of the principal,
the interest was appropriated by Congress
In consideiation of a cession of land made by
the Sacs and Foxes of the Missouri, by treaty of
October 21, 1837, the United States covenanted to
invest for their use $157,400, and to apply $3 370
of the interest of it toi beneficial objects, to effect
which instructions have been given The money
has not been invested, but the interest appro-
priated by act of Congress The ba'ance of it,
amounting to $4,500, (at five per centum,) has
not been paid, because not due The remaining
provisions have been fulfilled
The treaty made with the Yancton Sioux, on
the 21st of October, 1837, has been executed m
all its stipulations
The Wmnebagoes ceded their lands east of the
Mississippi to the United  States, by treaty of
November 1, 1837     In consideration thereof the
United States agreed to pay, " at the earnest soli
citation of the chiefs and delegates" of the nation,
$50,000 to certain individuals, which will be paid
here, $150,000 for their debts, which may be as
certamed to be justly due, and admitted  by the
Indians, and  to  pay, under the direction of the
President, $100,000 to the relatives and friends of
said Indians, of not less than quarter blood     To
ascertain the debts, and who are entitled under
the last clause, commissioners are now engaged
The payments to be made presently in goods,
horses, and provisions, have been attended to
The balance of the proceeds of the lands ceded,
namely, $1,100,000, is to be invested, and interest
at five per centum guarantied. The investment
has not been made, But the interest has been ap-
propriated by act of Congress Forty five Jiuri-
dred dollars of it are to be applied, by the treaty,
to education and other beneficial purposes For
the attainment of these and other useful objects
provided for, and to be gained when tfvey remove,
Governor Dodge has been desired to suggest 8
plan The balance of the $55,000 has not been
paid because not due
The stipulations of the treaty made with the
Iowa , on the 23d of November, 1837, have been
complied with
The Oneidas at Green Bay, by a treaty made
since the last annual íeport, viz on the 3d of
Februai y, 1838 which was ratified on the 17th of
May, ceded all the land " set apart for them in
' the first article of the treaty with the Menomonees,
' of February, 1831, and the second article of the
'treaty with the same tribe, of October 27,1832,"
reserving to the said Indians " to be held as other
Indian lands are held," a tract of one hundred
acres for each individual, which shall be so laid
down as " to include all the settlements and im-
provements in the vicinity of Green Bay " The
United States agreed to pay to the Orchard party
of the Oneida Indians $3 000, and to the first
Chns'ian party $30,500 Of the last sum, $3,000
are to go to the erection ofachurch and parsonage
house, and the residue of the $33,500 to be ap-
portioned, under the direction of the President,
to those having just claims thereto, the said aggie-
gate having been " designed to be in reimtmrae-
' ment of moneys expended by said Indians, and
' m remuneration of services rendered by theirchiefs
I ' and agents in purchasing and securing a title to
' the land ceded," and the United States further
agreed to have the reservations surveyed as soon
j as practicable Instiuctions have been given for
the execution of the several articles
I     A treaty was concluded with the Chippewas of
' Saginaw on the 14th of January, 1837. They
ceded several large tracts of land, the proceeds of
which the United States agreed should be invested
for their use The fourth article of the treaty set
apart $107,543 75 for specific purposes, which the
United States agieed to advance, but the third
article of the supplementhmited the amount to be
advanced to $75,000, and provided that the reduc-
tion shall be made upon the sums ratably, or in
any other manner the President may direct An
appropriation off 75,000 was accordingly made at
the last session of Congress, but as it cannot be
apportioned until the debts are ascertained, for
the payment of which §40,000 were allotted in the
said fourth article, $5,000 in money and $10,000
m goods, provided ior by the fourth article of the
supplement for the year 1838, haveonly been paid,
together with $100 for vaccine matter and the ser
vices of a physician, and $200for tobacco,accord-
ing to the fosirth article of the treaty The re-
maining $59 700 will be retained until the report
of the commissioner, recently appointed to ascer-
tain the debts, comes in, when a ratable distribu-
tion can be made The Land Office has been re-
quested to hasten the surveys and sales An ex-
ploring party has found a suitable location beyond
the Missouri, and the acting superintendent thinks
they will soon remove
These Indians concluded another treaty with
the United States on the 23d day of January,
1838, which was íatified on the 2d Tuly, 1838,
which relates to the sales of the lands ceded by the
treaty of the 14th January, 1837, and to their emi-
gration
By these several compacts, the United States
have acquired eighteen million four hundred and
fifty-eight thousand acres of land, for which the
sum stipulated to be paid lb $3 955,000

object They were renewed in 1836 by John A
Bryan, Esq , who negotiated the treaty of 23d
