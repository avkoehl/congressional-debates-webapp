heard anything of a general rendezvous. The escort consisted of Major Evans and 5 men of Company A, Ninth Missouri State Militia. They were all bushed by 10 or 12 men; 1 slightly and 1 dangerously wounded; balance escaped. I knew nothing of the arms going to Columbia until I heard of the capture. It was a badly managed affair.

Captain GEORGE S. HAMPTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Paola, Kans.:

CAPTAIN: I moved with my company from the station yesterday morning at 4 o'clock. Struck the timber on fork of Grand River, and scouted it carefully to a point 3 miles west of Harrisonville, Mo. Struck and followed trail supposing it that of a body of the enemy, but finding it that of a portion of Colonel Moonlight's command moving eastward, returned, scouting through timber of second fork of Grand, and have just reached this station. Have found no indication of the enemy's presence, and am satisfied that, owing to the lack of subsistence, he has no force in the section though which I have scouted. I move this evening to Rockville.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. HUNTON,

Captain Co. H, Eleventh Kansas Volunteer Cavalry.
