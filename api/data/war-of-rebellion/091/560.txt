I inclose four papers - first, the best field return I could get, giving aggregate present only; second, the list of transports, with the men and material each carries; third, the sealed instructions I gave the senior officer of each transport; fourth, a circular which I issued this morning.

For convenience sake I have been obliged to preserve the organization of two brigades. A few of the regiments have some new stock, but, generally speaking, they are a very reliable set of men.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
