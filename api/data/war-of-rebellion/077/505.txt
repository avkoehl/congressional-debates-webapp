in a fort, surrendered to Forrest, who appears to be tearing up the track and capturing block-houses and forts as he goes. Rebel forces were reported advancing on Elk River bridge. General Croxton left Franklin with brigade of cavalry at daylight this morning. I have sent by train to Pulaski 1,300 cavalry and a battery, and will follow in an hour with all the other force that can be spared from here. Troops sent to re-enforce the Nashville and Chattanooga road should report to General Milroy at Tullahoma, as he has full instructions where to place the men.

PULASKI, September 27, 1864-1. 15 p. m.

Infantry all here and formed in line ready for the enemy. Cavalry have just completed the retrograde movement and formed on the left. Pretty brisk skirmishing. Enemy advancing. We are all ready and anxious. We shall attack. Troops here, except those brought with me, are worthless; the most demoralized I have ever seen. The enemy are moving round in our rear, 3,000 men and six pieces of artillery, it is reported.

PULASKI, September 27, 1864.

Skirmishing was kept up all day. This evening the enemy advanced a heavy skirmish line to within a short distance of ours. It is my impression, also General Johnson's, that their main lines will be advanced to-night, and that they intend to attack in the morning. Our loss to-day will not exceed 80. To avoid a flank movement I sent a brigade of cavalry back on the Nashville pike, six or eight miles from here. I hear of no movement of the enemy in that direction. A prisoner captured in Marshall County reports that he was en route to McMinnville with dispatches for General Williams, who was to join Forrest. This man reports that Forrest has eighteen or twenty pieces [of artillery] and about 7,000 men. Six or seven regiments were recently transferred from Wheeler. The prisoner was recently under Wheeler. To-day we withdrew our cavalry, keeping main lines concealed to invite attack, but the ruse failed. The Fifteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry is at Chattanooga. Would it not be well to order it up on the Chattanooga road by railroad? There should be cavalry on that road.

PULASKI, September 28, 1864.

The enemy withdrew fro this place last night, going south. The wires are cut and about sixty yards of the track on one side burnt at a wood-yard about twelve miles north. Have sent Colonel Ord's [?] brigade to watch road and make repairs as far as Culleoka, twenty-two miles
