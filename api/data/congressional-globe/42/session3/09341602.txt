dreadful temptation. Yet who could foretell
the consequences to the Republic should it
come to pass that the people should feel that
they had been defrauded of their rights through
the electors? The system permits it. and the
fact that we have thus far escaped is owing
more to our good fortune than to our fore-
sight. So indignant were the people at Jack-
son's defeat in 1825 that every leading public
man connected with the elevation to the Presi-
dency of Mr. Adams was politically ruined.
Jackson, nevertheless, was defeated by the
legitimate workings of the electoral machinery
of our Constitution.
Most of all, the present system is unjust and
unequal in its operations. Take the State of
Indiana as an illustration: Grant's vote was
168,144; Greeley's vote was 163,637; here
was a majority of only 4,507 votes for Grant,
yet in the Electoral College Grant gets a credit
really for 331,781. The mere majority of 4,507
votes carries for him the fifteen electoral votes
of that State. Take, again, New York: Grant's
vote was 440,759; Greeley's vote was 387,279;
yet in the Electoral College Grant has a credit
of 828,038 votes. His majority of 53,480 votes
gives to him the thirty-five electoral votes of
that State; whereas in a fair expression of
the popular will Grant should have had, in
the case of Indiana, only eight electoral votes
and Greeley seven, and, in the case of New
York, Grant should receive but nineteen
votes and Greeley sixteen votes. Then, by
a fair system of voting, Grant would have
a majority of but four electoral votes in the
States of Indiana and New York; whereas in
fact he has fifty majority.
The injustice of the present system of voting
for Presidents and Vice Presidents is, not only
that majorities are ignored, but they are
counted for the majority. The following tabu-
lated statement places the matter in a clearer
light than any comment I can make on the

Difference between the proportional and actual majority for Grant     
It will also be seen from these tables that
while Greeley had eighty per cent, of the
popular vote, he received but twenty-five per
cent, of the electoral vote. This being so,
it is easy to be seen that one candidate may
have a large majority of the popular vote and
may still fail to secure a majority of the elect-
oral vote, as was the case in the election of
Mr. Adams, in 1825. Then a direct vote by
the people is the only way to a fair election.
The district system has been favored by some.
Mr. Benton particularly advocated its adop-
tion. The question of amending the Consti-
tution so as to change the method of electing
the Presidentand Vice President of the United
States was referred to a select committee of
the Senate, of which Mr. Benton was chair-
man, at the beginning of the first session
of the Nineteenth Congress. During the same
Congress, on the 19th day of January, 1826,
the committee reported to the Senate, and in
their report favored the district system, which
provided that each State should be divided
into districts equal in number to the whole
number of Senators and Representatives of
such State in Congress, and the person who
should receive the greatest number of votes for
President in any such district should be held
to have received one vote. Much can be said
in favor of this system ; but it is very objec-
tionable, because liable to a great abuse in
the erection of the districts.
When we eall to mind the many instances
in which the will of the people has been
frustrated in the most outrageous manner,
within the last few years, by gerrymandering
Legislatures, in dividing States into congres-
sional and legislative districts, we would
be very reluctant to trust them With the
division of States into presidential districts.
Take the State of Pennsylvania, for instance.
Out of the twenty-five members of Congress
elected from that State by districts) the Dem-
ocrats should have, under a fair apportion-
ment of the State, twelve members, and the
Republicans thirteen; while in fact, inthe next
Congress, Pennsylvania will have butfive Dem-
ocrats from districts and the Republicans
twenty, besides the three Congressmen-at-
large. There could be no easier way of de-
feating the will of the people than by the dis-
trict system. Pennsylvania is but an isolated
case. There are very few States in which the
prevailing party has not attempted to make its
power secure by anunfairdivisionof the'States
into congressional and legislative districts. In
one of the large States of the Union'afew years
ago the "ins " were defeated by over seventy
thousand majority; yet it did not give to the
successful party the control of the Legislature,
because of the gross unfairness practiced by
the defeated party in districting the State.
Another objection to the district system is
that it is possible, as well as probable, that a
candidate for the Presidency may have a large
majority of the votes and yet not have a ma-
jority of the districts. I repeat, then, that
nothing but a direct vote of the people, irre-
spective of State or district lines, and without
the intermediation of electors, will give full
and fair expression to the popular will.
In the second place, Mr. Speaker, I desire
to examine very briefly the amendment as
affecting a change in the length of the presi-
dential term. The resolution proposes to
make the President ineligible a second time,
and Increases the term to six years. This I
regard as one of the most important changes
proposed, and one the adoption of which is
imperatively demanded. The omission of a
provision in the Constitution against the re-
eligibility of the President caused its ratification
by the States to be violently opposed. Espe-
cially was this the case in the Virginia con-
vention.
What should be the length of the presiden-
tial term has been a subject of much debate.
Those contending for the shorter period
thought it furnished the better security against
the dangerous abuse of power, and the longer
the period the less would personal respons-
ibility be felt. Those who contended for a
longer term argued that a short term weak-
ened the executive power as a check in Gov-
ernment, and tended to produce vacillation
and imbecility in the President. The proposi-
tions on this subject in the Convention of 1787
were various. At first Hamilton? Madison,
and Jay, the three leading spirits of that Con-
vention, favored an Executive chosen during
good behavior. Another proposition was to
chooae an Executive for seven years, and which
at first passed by a bare majority of one; but
being coupled with a clause "to be chosen by
the national Legislature," it was approved by
a vote of eight States against two. Another
amendment was added, '"to be ineligible a
second time," and it passed by a vote of eight
States against one, one being divided. In this
form the clause stood in the original draft of
the Constitution. But at last, upon the report
of a committee, the method of electing the
President was changed to its present shape,
the length of term reduced from seven years
to four, and the President made reeligible
without limit. The report of the committee
was adopted by a vote of ten States against
one- , , ,,
The result thus reached was undoubtedly a
compromise between those who feared cen'
tralization in the head and those who dreaded
anarchy in the members. If he was to be in-
eligible after the first time, then those jealous
of power were willing the term of office should
be seven years. But if he is to be reeligible,
then the periods of election mast occur more
