must remember, that to resist Hood's advance into Tennessee I had to reorganize and almost thoroughly equip the force now under my command. I fought the battles of the 15th and 16th instant with the troops but partially equipped, and, notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather and the partial equipment, have been enable dot drive the enemy beyond Duck River, crossing two steams with my troops, and driving the enemy from position to position, without the aid of pontoon,s and with but little transportation to bring up supplies of provisions and ammunition. I am doing all in my power to crush Hood's army, and, if it be possible, will destroy it; but pursuing an enemy through an exhausted country, over mud roads, completely sagged with heavy rains, is no child's play, and cannot be accomplished as quickly as thought of. I hope, in urging me to push the enemy, the Department remembers that General Sherman took with him the complete organizations of the Military Division of the Mississippi, well equipped in every respects as regards ammunition, supplies, and transportation, leaving me only two corps, partially stripped of their transportation to accommodate the force taken with him, to oppose the advance into Tennessee of that army which had resisted the advance of the Army of the Military Division of the Mississippi on Atlanta, from the commencement of the campaign until its close, and which is now, in addition, aided by Forrest's cavalry. Although my progress may appear slow, I feel assured that Hood's army can be driven from Tennessee, and eventually driven to the wall, by the force under my command; ut too much must not be expected of troops which have to be reorganized, especially when they have the task of destroying a force in a winter campaign which was able to make an obstinate resistance to twice its numbers in spring and summer. In conclusion, I can safely state that this army is willing to submit to any sacrifice to oust Hood's army, or to strike any other blow which would contribute tot he destruction of the rebellion.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, In the Field, December 21, 1864.

Major-General HALLECK,Washington, D. C.:

I have heard to-day that General McCook attacked a portion of Lyon's force at Hopkinsville on the 17th [16th] and dispersed it, capturing one gun, and that Colonel La Grange attacked another portion at Ashbysburg, on Green River, Ky., scattering his men in all directions, causing him to burn most of his baggage, a considerable number of small-arms and ammunition. La Grange's force drove Lyon's rear guard into the river, killing and drowning a great many. He will continue the pursuit as soon as he can cross the river. The progress of the force under my command is impeded by the high state of water in Harpeth River, Rutherford's Creek, and Duck River; but, with the assistance of pontoons, just up, I hope we shall be able to continue the pursuit in the morning.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
