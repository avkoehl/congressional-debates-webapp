THE CONGRESSIONAL- GLOBE.
January 26,
and shake her hoary locks We live, sn, in an
sge of improvement, and that is indeed a false and
shoit-sigbted philosophy, a philosophy which has
no deeper toundation than poetin, wnich inculcates
the wisdom of always " bearing the ills we have,"
lest we incur the risk of encountering " othtis that
we know not of " One of the beauties of our íepub
hcan system of Government is, that it can accom-
modate itself to changes which time and circum-
stances may demand lis charm is not the
inflexibility of a despotism—no, sir, it is not
unbending to the spirit of refoim and ímpiove-
ment In its veneration for the past, it is not blind
to the treasures which lie m the Juture
The resolution under consideration, sir, seeks
to establish a great abstiact principle, íesulting
from the relation in which we stand to the people,
and yet gentlemen who have opposed its passage,
have seen fit to discuss the íesolution on the
assumption that it was introduced solely m tefer
ence to the printer of this [louse, and a most
labored attempt has been made to show that a
printer is not an office*, but a contmctoi Sir, I
consider such topics wholly irrelevant To talk
about a printer to this House, is indeed beuttling
the subject under discussion A resolution is
introduced to establish a great principle of popular
right, and gentlemen take it upon themselves to
narrow down the discussion to thequeiy, whether
it will change the mode heretofoie pmsued of
electing the pnnterof this House I have endeav-
ored, sir, to take a more elevated view of the pun-
ciple which the resolution contains, as having
higher objects and higher game than the mere
printer of this House First establish a rule, a
principle, sir, and when we are called upon to go
into election1!, it will be time enough tomqune
what officer comes within the rule It is, how-
ever, wrong, sir, to contend, as some gentlemen
have contended, that the íesolution for thi-s ses-
sion and that Congress must necessauly be pei
fectly nugatory as to every officei except the
printer to this Hou«e You, Mi Speaker, aie
not immortal The Clerk, the sergeant at arms,
and al. the officers of this House, may be called
upon to pay the great debt of nature befoie the
termination of this session I sincerely hope,
sir, that we may not be called upon to fill any
vacancies, but that the occasion for doing so is
beyond the lange of possibility, is contending
entirely too much
It is somewhat strange, sir, (if, to follow the
bad example of other gentlemen, I may be per-
mitted to say a woid about public printer,) it is
"passing sttange," that while honoiable gentle-
men contend that your public pnntei is so ami !y
foitified by certain joint i evolutions passe 1 in 1819
and 1829, one of the most vigilant and talented
gentlemen on this flooi (he meant the gentleman
from Kentucky, Mr Hardin) should have found
it necessaiy to offei a proviso, in ordei to save
 your public printer fiom the operation of the res
olution now under consideration A long discus
eion has alieady been had upon the que tion
whether the joint resolution of the 5 h Febuia y,
1829, repeals the resolution of the 3d March,
1819, as it íegards the manner in which we aie to
vote for punter The lastsection of the resolutioa
of 1819 piovides, " that this House shall proceed
to ballot for a pnntei," and the resolution of 1829,
which is amendatory of the former resolution,
provides " that withm thirty days befoie the ad
'journmentof every Congress, each House shall
' proceed to vote for a printer to execute its woik
' for and duungthe succeeding Congiess, and tnat
*  the former resolution, so fai as  it lsalteied by
*  the latter resolution, be repelled " Permit me
heie, sir, to uige an idea that does not yet seem to
have suggested itself to gentlemen I contend that
the last section of the resolu ion of 1819, which
provides that the two Houses shall " ballot" for
a printer, expired with the Congress that passed
it, and by its own limitation It provides, " that
as soon as this íesolution shall have been approved
by the President, each House shall proceed to
ballot for a punter, to execute its work during the
next Congiess " It does not provide that each
and every Congress theteafter should elect a
printer for its successor, but simply that that Con-
gress (of 1819) should elect a printer for the then
next Congress     It is said, however, that the act
of 1829, by lepealing so much of the first resolu-
tion as was altered by the last, shows that the
whole of tne first resolution was intended to be
permaneiK To this 1 answei, that the resolution
of 1819 contains various sections and provisions
besides that which prescribes the manner of elect-
ing a pnntei But again, if it be true that the
last section of the resolution of ]919 had per
foimed its office, after the punters for the two
Houses in 1819 were appointed, I am not aware
that the repealing words contained in the íesolution
of 1829 can revivethat which was alieady defunct
He was not aware that the repeal of a certain
poi tion of a dead statute rev ived the residue H e
had always supposed that dead things weie void
things, and that void thir <*s were as no things
He could not foibear heie to umind the House
that the ©onstuution provides that the yeas and
navs may be called ¡it the lequest of one filth of
the membeis present Why do gentlemen daily
ca'l for the yeas and nays but to present the mem-
bers of this House to then consti uents, and to
awaken that sense of responsibility which our
position heie natuially implies ' What on incon-
gruity this, sir You huve a light to call iheyeas
and nays upon a proposition to appropr ate the
paltry burn of ten dolíais, and yet, when the offi-
cers of this House, possessing so much powei
and patronage, aie to be chosen, it is said to be
best, and most conducive to out own independ-
ence, and to the interest of the people, to give a
secietvote Was it necessaiy furthei to com-
ment upon the unsoundness of suchana-gumtnt'
He wruld here, also, before he sat down, take
occasion to premise that the mode of voting vw i
voce foi the officers of tins House would veiy
much tend to the saving of time, because it is
much the most convenient mode, we should by
that means avoid the fuss and partde tnat now
distinguished oui elections the trouble and deten
tion ot fiist collecting the ballots,and then appoint
ing tellers to go thiough the tedious ceremony,
not once, but sometimes eight oi ten Hires of can-
vassing the votes, would be obviated Hud gen-
tlemen forgotten the time that was consumed here
a few months ago in the election of a chaplain
lie meant nothing derogatory to that respectable
office when he said that all tins parade, and cer-
emony, and consumption of time, were beneath
the dignity of the House, but he freely confessed
that the point of convenience was a minor one, and
was swallowed up m the question of principle
I he i elation in which we stood to oui constituents
requued an open ar d manly discharge of all oui
duties here Delicacy, the lear of offending our
fi lends, these motives weigh but a feather against
the light of the people to know what we do in
execution of the high trusts confided to ua We
should always remember, as a geneial rule, that
honesty leqmies no concealment, that justice
holds no communion with secrecy and daikness
Mi PEARCE, of Rhode Island, said he would
be willing to udopt the views of the gentleman
fiom Illinois, [Mi Ri vnolds,] who proposed this
resolution, so fat as to say that hereafter the offi-
ceis of the House should be elected viva loce
whenever a msjouty of that House, by express
declaiagen, should requne it Thus far he would
be willing to go, but no farther This was not a
new question in the House He welliemembered
that, about six vears ago, an honorable member
from Kentucky made a similar proposition Mr
P baid he then thought it unfortunate for the pro-
posal, as it wis now, that it was offered for con
sideiation,after the long session of Congress was
passed, and we had come nearly to the close of tie
short session, and were just about going into the
election of the public printer It had been con-
tended that some great and fundamental principles
weie involved in this question If so, why was
it now agitated by those gentlemen foi the fiist
time > Where had they been all this time, that
this subject, of such vital interest, had been suf-
fered to rest in statu quo ? Why have they been
thus long forgetful of those great principles' Mr
P said it was useless to disguise the mattei We
had better speak of things as they aie It was
designed to apply, and did apply, to the election
of printer, and to nothing eke On that question
Mr P was willing to give his vote viva voce He
was willing to, and would now, declare for v/hom
he should vote to fill that station It would be for
the candidate who had consistently and faithfully
adhered to and suppoited the Administration it
would be for him to whom he believed it of right
belonged In short, he should vote for Mr.
Blati, if that gentleman was a candidate before
the House Bui. he could not consent to alter or
abolish wnat he believed to be a most salutary
rule as applied to all the other officers of the
House—the Speaker, Clerk, chaplain, the door-
keeper and his assibtants, even the very boys in
waning—if the House thought proper, might be
chosen by ballot
Mi P said he undnstood that the Legislature
of Illinois—tne State from which the honorable
nembei [Mr Rfynolds] who introduced the íes-
olution came—elected then oflicets vwa voce H
might be so in some other instances, but moio
than two thirds of the States conducted their elee
tioiis by ballot and he apprehended if the ques-
tion were taken by States on that Poor, theie
would be found a large majority opposed to a
change of the mle in his own State the voie by
ballot pievailed in all excep ing one vote, which
might be considered a «jurist ballot He cou'd not,
th°refoie, duectly or indiiectly, sanction by his
vote a course which he deemed improper, noi did
he wish to see a future Congress influenced by
any act of the piesent If the gentleman fiom
New York [Mi Vai dlrpoll] was so much
attached to the demociaticjl principles of the vole
vwa voce, why did not he, while a member of the
Legi^latui e of tnat S ate, endeavor to secure its
blessings to his constituents' Why not have the
elections in New Yoih uto voce, like those ot
Vuginia and Kentucky ' What (he asked) would
hav e become of the late election in the city of New
Yoik had it been conducted wwa voce' How
would the Democratic j)arty have otood against
the wealth and power of the Whigs' The very
votes of the Democratic f a-ty would have lost the
votéis their employmen and then bread They
were compelled to weai secret badges on their
coats and hats by which to distinguish each other
Gentlemen may say this state of things ought not
to exist But, as they do exist, we must meet
the exigency It was light sometimes to do good
by stealth, covertly and sécietly The state of
things fully authorized it
Mi P said, if the vote viva voce was to be
adopted here, a very d fferent complexion of affans
would soon be exhibited lie w is undi«guieedly
opposed to this sys'em of special legislation He
was indeed opposed to the adoption of any rule
foi tue government of those over whom we could
have no control Toi Ins own part, he had never
given a vote there that he was unwilling to avow
Cut it had been said the people had a right to
know the votes of then Representatives Nov/,
he had never discoveied that the people had evei
evinced any gieat curiosity on this subject
The present system had prevailed foi forty
years, and the people had manifested no special
anxiety for its change When they did so, it
would be time enough to act in the matter The
gentleman fiom New York went on the ground
that the course hitherto pursued had been eirone-
ous If such were the fact, he had only to repeat
the inquiry which he had before made—why had
they thus long slept upon their oars' Why did
they not earlier seek a correction of the evil'
Mr P alluded to the en cum stances attending
the first election of General Green as punter to the
House, and said peihaps he ought to apologize
for the frank manner in which he had avowed his
intention of suppoitmg a Darticular candidate at
the next election on party grounds In the city of
New York this principle had been earned to its
utmost extent, embracing its street commissioners,
and, he believed, its chimneysweeps. Nay, the
leading daily papers openly ca'led upon their ad-
herents to support none but Whig butchers, Whig
6«tos,and Whig every thing If this principle was
so univeisally recognised elsewhere, why should
it not be here' The Globe was the accredited
oigan of the Government and of the Democratic
paity, and as such should be sustained by it In
the city of Philadelphia the principle was extended
to the watchmen, and in his own town of Provi-
dence, to the constables and the town crier—none
were allowed to cry but a Whig'    He was, there-
