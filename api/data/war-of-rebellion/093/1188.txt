TULLAHOMA, November 30, 1864.

Major-General ROUSSEAU:

I have ordered my command to fall in for the march. There is a very large amount of stuff here, mostly military, awaiting shipment. I learn that a train of box-cars that brought troops to Cowan will pass here about 9 a.m., going north. The garrison from Manchester will be in soon, and will be too tired to march farther; I will put them on as guards to the train; have all baggage loaded on, and follow soon after us. A portion of the Fifth Tennessee Cavalry have been west on a scout some days. I have sent for them, and they too will follow after. I will start the column, and wait here until I can get the place evacuated and all stores off. The troops at Shelbyville have been ordered to meet me at Wartrace. The 9 o'clock train can pick up garrison and camp equipage of block-houses.

R. H. MILROY,

Major-General.

Major-General ROUSSEAU:

I have not yet learned whether I can go by Wartrace. Please let me know what I shall leave here. Have got artillery loaded and ready to start, but it will take some hours yet to get ready to evacuate.

R. H. MILROY,

Major-General.

MURFREESBOROUGH, November 30, 1864.

Major-General MILROY,

Tullahoma:

Your dispatch received. Have not heard from General Thomas as to coming by Wartrace. I will take the liberty to say you can come that way. Your stores and sick should be loaded on train before you leave. If ready send the artillery on at once with guards. The trains have left here for stores and sick. What amount of subsistence stores have you? The trains going to Chattanooga with stores should be fully loaded with what is most valuable. What will you have over and above an ordnance train load?

LOVELL H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.

TULLAHOMA, November 30, 1864.

Major-General STEEDMAN:

I am ordered to evacuate this place and the line from Elk River to Murfreesborough, and am about to start to march through. Hope we will soon close the gap between us again; till then, adieu. I have my sick loaded on a train for Chattanooga by order General Thomas. I will need train to transport stores, &amp;c.

R. H. MILROY,

Major-General.
