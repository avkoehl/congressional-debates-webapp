Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I occupied Centerville. no provisions, no forage, no wagon train, no telegraphic communication. All quiet during the night. If this place is to be held it needs a stronger force.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

The whole thing here was a shameful panic. There were only a few hundred of the rebels ever seen, and yet the railroads and telegraph lines were abandoned at their approach. General Geary is here. I have seen him, and this is my summing up. Send no more men. My division is sufficient to recover the Shenandoah Valley if furnished with subsistence and forage. This is the problem to solve. The railroad ought to be repaired forthwith to Front Royal. Subsistence and forage forwarded after us. All but Geary's and Duryea's command recalled, as they will only encumber us for want of supplies. Duryea goes back to his old position, to guard the railroad and Catlett's; Geary to take the road by Aldie to Berry's Ferry; I do Front Royal. Some of my command are already scouring the different routes - Warrenton route, for instance. The enemy will fly before us. We will intercept the force against banks, If it is not already in flight. From all I can learn it was very inconsiderable; but some man of energy must be sent be sent to hold the valley or the mountain guerrillas will retake it. I can rejoin General McDowell by way of Gordonsville. If you will send me supplies and forage I will do the work myself. The others will be of no use to me. The whole was a stampede.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I would respectfully recommend that Ord's division be recalled to Alexandria and held there until I try the enemy in the Shenandoah Valley, and that forage and subsistence be sent to me, to go on at once. There is nothing to apprehend.
