The Secretary of War has directed that no more prisoners of war be forwarded to City Point till further orders.

W. HOFFMAN,

Commissary-General of Prisoners.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, July 13, 1863.

Colonel WILLIAM HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners:

COLONEL: Will you please send to me the paroles referred to in the inclosed communication* of Mr. Fox, and return to me the communication itself. Paroles taken and given prior to the 22nd day of May last, if properly authenticated, will be counted in exchange, that date being after serving of the same upon Mr. Ould. Have you not also some paroles, taken by Stoneman and Kilpatrick in Virginia, and by Grierson in Mississippi, previous to the 22nd of May? Please send to me all such, and I will endeavor to arrange them. I wish in my next interview with Mr. Ould in a few days to close up this whole matter of paroles.

I telegraphed you yesterday for information concerning Grant's captures. Did he parole both officers and men? What was the whole number of each? The steamers have not arrived with prisoners of war from Fort Delaware. I mean the second detachment, &amp;c., estimated at 1,800. They returned from City Point last Monday and proceeded to Fort Delaware, intending to return immediately. I am going North in a few days and desire to close up, as far as possible, exchanges before I leave. If I had information about the paroles made at Vicksburg, Miss., I would offset against them immediately the deliveries made at City Point, and thus clean out Camp Parole. Can you not hasten the matter? Please reply by return mail.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, July 13, 1863.

Colonel WILLIAM HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners:

COLONEL: I have found here the list of Yazoo City captures about which I wrote to you this morning. I think I can use them in exchange.

Yours, respectfully,

WM. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.
