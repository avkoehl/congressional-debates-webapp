man, the present political aspect of this country,
and the condition of parties, evidently demand
that a Representative occupying the independent
position which I have the honor to do upon this
floor—responsible to no party; boutfd by no po-
litical organization; controlled by none of the
political elements of the country; responsible
alone to an intelligent and independent constitu-
ency, who have confided to my guardianship, in
part, their gfcat national interest, trusting alone
to tlie honest and patriotic exercise of the discre-
tionary powers with which they Vested me—
should, at least, indicate to them, and perhaps to
the country, tho views which he entertains, and the
principles by which his legislative action will be
guided, in reference to the great questions that
now Agitate the public mind.

fearful elements of discord that now disturb its
peace and tranquillity, are urged on with a degree

ducing an alienation of feeling, interest, and senti-
ment between the two sections of the Union, that
