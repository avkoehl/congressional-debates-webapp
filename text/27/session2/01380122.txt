the Tieasmy, Mr Ewmg m his report to tin-  Hou^ on Hie 3d
of June, liyil, (Document No 2,) tells in that he exr enses of
the Government m the year 1840, the last year of Mr Van Bu
ren's administration, amounted to $27,S6¿,475 H The present
Secretary of the Tieasttry, Mr Forward, in his report of De
cember20, 1841, to this House (Document No 1S> informs ys
that the expenses of the Government for the year 1841, the first
yeat of the present Admin istiation, -were $32,025,070 7©, and he
estimates the expenses of the Government for the year 1842, be
ing *he second year of this Amimmetration, at $32,791,010 78
the fiistyear of thia Admimstiation showing an increased ex
penduureovei the last year of Mr "Van Buren's admmibtration
of $4,161,595 29, and the second year showing an increased
expendiime over the last year of Mr Van Buren's adrmms
tratmn of $4,9^7,535 37, or nearly uve millions I shall not,
said Mr F putsuc further this subject of expenditures I have
simply given the amounts as furnished by the officers of thi3
Administration, and those figutes show pretty well what has
been and what is to he accomplished in the way of economy, re
trenckment, and reform
It becomes us now to inquire what provision the wi°dom <sf
this Administration has made for these increased demands upon
the public Treasury The first impOitant act affecting the
Trea^uiy, was the Distribution act ofthe last session, by which
the proceeds of the sales of the public lands, amounting to the
annua! average amount of three millions of dollar , weie di
verted from the general Treasury, and given to the several
States and the next act, and one which ever follows close upon
the heels of prodigality, was a resort to borrowing For tins
purpose a *aw was passed authouzm? the Secretary of the
Treasury tobonow, upon the crpdtt of the Government the
sum of twelve millions of dollars upon the bondto of the Govern
meui, and of this loan ahout one half bas been received and t^x
pended and as to phe other half, the Secretary of the Trcasuiy,
ma letter of the third of this month, addressed to the chairman
ef theCommittee of Waysand Means, say
* Immediately after oi¿? fit si conversation relatiie to ihp
views of the committee upon the stihjpct of a loan as a
means of supplying the wants of the Treasury, I addressed
private letters to correspondents \n Nexo York and Boston,
for the purpose of ascertaining the practicability of stiling
stocks to the amount of two or three millions, provided the
term of reimbursement should be enlarged to twelve years
The mfwmatwn received was entirely decisive as to the im-
possibility of obtaining any thing like an adequate supply
in time to i eheve the existing pressure, and I think it may
be confidently anticipated that, ¡>o long as the present state
of the money market shall continue^ the prospect of borrow
inir anv considei able amount of money in the United States
is quite hopeless A resort to Europe for loans will be indis
psnsable, but the delay that must necpssai üy intervene will
be swc/¿ that unless some other mod'' of supplying the wants
of the Department be provided by Congress the greatest
embarrassments must ensue Under these Circumstances, I
have no hesitation in reco > mending an issue of Tieasuiy
notes as a measure of obviou? necessity "
Wha* Abpectacle* While those who passed the distribution
bid, are boosting ol the splendid donation mide to the Siafes by
abstracting the land revenue from the Trcnsury, the agentb of
your Government are sneaking about f-om bank to banirand

Bu, and Mr F upon two occasions since I hive hal a seat
upon this floor, I have voted for the it-sue of Tieasnry notetsto
supply the temporary wants of the Government theiast occa
sion was m I ebruary, 1841, and the bill wab passed, not so
much for the then necessities of theTieasury, as ma spirit of
Iiberalit} towards the incoming Administration, which has had
the beneft of neaily the whole issue under that law I believed
then,asido now, that as a temporary expedient, as a mode
of anticipating lor a month, ot lor a few months, the accruing
revenueof die countiy,as a mode W equalizing the receipts
and expendituies of the financial year, the expenditures being
heaviest in the eaily part of the >ear, and the receipts the
htaviest m the latter part of the yeai, but m all cases to be
paid out of the revenue of the year, that an issue of Treasury
notes was the safest, and by far the most economical mode of
supplying a temporary deficiency m the funds of the Govern-
ment They entered into the operations of the Government
quietly, but efTdCtually, without additional machinery or addi-
tional expense The aid of no broker was called in No son.
of the Secretary of the Treasury was paid for negotiating
loans Upon those grounds they were recommended by the
tht-n able liuulof the Tieasmy Department, Mi Woodbury.
The credit of the Government being good, they were gladly
taken by the public creditor at par value, and piomptly re-
deemed when due, and had the last administration continued in
power, I firmly believe that neither the loan of July of twelve
millions noi the issue of Treasury notes now asked for, would
have been necessary Sir, it is a high compliment
to the late President, as well as to his Secretary of the Trea-
sury, that a measure for wbich, moie than any other, they
were vilified, 1  one of the first measures of this Administra-
tion It is a precious conlession this, of the present Secreta-
ry, that the issue of Treasury notes is a "measui* of obvious
necessity" Why, sir, during the last Presidential canvass,
engraved imitations of those notes were published in every Fe-
deial paper—weie fluttered before the people by every Federal
s ump orator, and posted upon the walls of every log cahm I
rejoice that the "t,obtr second thought3' of those who ridiculed
and opposed them, ha  found them to bt "a measure of ob-
vious nece^ity "
Mr Chairman, continued Mr T I shall vote against this bill
for the followinglea^ons
Because I do not believe that, in the low state of credit m
which the Government stand-*, they will command their norm
nal value m specie, and I -am opposed to paying the public
creditor m depreciated paper.
Because it is not proposed that they shall be issued asa tempo-
rary relief, tobe paid out of the ordinary revenue of the Go-
vernment to accrue within the year, on the contrary, the hill
expressly provides that they are to be paid with money to be
borrowed, if it can be done, on a permanent loan, and 1 am ut-
teily opposed to commencing 01 increasing a national debtm
time of profound peace, and that, too, before any provision is
made (or tht payment oí it Oui foreign relations, we aie every
day told, are of the most delicate character I trust that any
controversy of a warlike nature is far from us, but it may come,
anlifitdous, 1 hope that, however unprepared in other respecta,
our national ercdit may be found unexhausted, unimpaired,
unembanafcsed even to the value of a dollar I will sooner vote
for a direct tax, thin fir a national debt m time of peace
B< ctttise ihe controlling majority in Congress have it in their
power tors stoie die pioceeds of the sales of the public lands to
the Treasury, where thtyiightfully and constitutionally belong;
and refuse to do so A portion of these lands (said Mr.
F) were ceded by some of the States to the Federal Go-
vernment, for the benefit of the Union, that the money
arising from the sales might be applied to the support of
the Government, and the taxes upon the people thereby be
diminished Another poition was purchased with the
money collected from the people for the support of the Govern
rnent, and the proceeds of 1 ight should go to defray the expenses
of the Government, that the'axes upon the people may by that
much be thi 'e'-s Hut thi^ very Congie^s, by a gross breach of
UUftt has divened the proceeds of the lands fiom their legm-
m ite object, a-d now seek  to supply the deficiency ny a loan
which must bo eventually pa'd by mcrei^ed taxation upon the

to restore this fund, refuse to uo so, upon them be the respon
sibihty of fcsuiTlring the Gov rnment tu Ledis¿)d*,ed 101 want of
money to meet it¡= engagements
Another reason why he would not vote for further loans to he
paid by further taxes upon the industry of thecountiy,
was that this Government has upon deposite with the
several States, the sum of twenty eight million of dollar*
whirl! it has aright to call for at any moment This money,
«aid Mr F came into the Tieasury by way of duties upon
articles imponed inO tne country, which duties were added to
the puce of the article, and weie therefore paid by the consu
mers, the great body of the people it was collected
of them by tins mdiiMt mode of taxation to defrav the
necessary expemts of the Government—nnf heme: required for
