A 300-pounder Parrott shell has just dismounted a 24-pounder flank casemate howitzer in an important position, breaking the iron wheels and other parts beyond our power of repair. There are two pieces of the same kind with carriages, and all lying useless at Moultrie, I understand. Cannot I have one of them? Four negroes slightly wounded since morning report.
