Brigadier General J. KILPATRICK, Commanding Third Cavalry Division:

The enemy's cavalry on the south side of the Chattahoochee threatens General Schofield's right flank on or near the Sandtown and Atlanta road. The general commanding directs that you make a demonstration opposite to and below Sandtown as if you intended to cross the river. Make the greatest show a force by counter marching command. Let this be done at an early hour but without harassing your animals more than is necessary.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,DAVID F. HOW,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The enemy is behind intrenchments south of the creek and facing toward my flank. I have sent Hascall to cross the creek and try to clear that flank, while the rest of the corps is pushing forward. I think the force south of the creek is only cavalry with artillery.
