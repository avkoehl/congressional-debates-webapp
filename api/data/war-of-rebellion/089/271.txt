HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES,October 18, 1864-11 a. m.

General KAUTZ:

I send you a marked article in the Richmond Enquirer,* which I think you had better read to your troops and ask them if they can't beat such cavalry as is therein described.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,Mrs. Gay's House, October 18, 1864-3.30 p. m.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding:

GENERAL: Your note and the Enquirer received. There has been no difficulty about the enemy's cavalry, except to meet them, with us. It has been our fortune to be opposed to infantry, artillery, and breast-works, almost without exception. If you will engage to keep the infantry off us, we will try and take care of their cavalry. I have been quite unwell since I last saw you, but trust I shall be out again before any movement takes place. I send the requisition of the Fourth Wisconsin Battery; requisitions for ordnance with an indorsement as to the state battery.

Very respectfully, &amp;c,

AUGUST V. KAUTZ,

Brigadier-General.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I have nothing particular to report. the Artillery firing last night was the shelling of the enemy's working parties in front of our extreme right. I am going to-day to ride over the lines recently constructed in front of City Point, after which, if not too late, I shall probably be at City Point.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
