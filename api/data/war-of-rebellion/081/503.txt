COLONEL: I have the honor to acknowledge your communication just received, touching a connection with General Gibbon. We now connect (or did fifteen minutes ago) with the right brigade of General Gibbon, which was close on to the left brigade of my division of General Gibbon should move to the left I will extend a thin line to keep up the connection. I have ascertained that the picket-line of General Wright still remains and has had no orders to move. It extends at least three quarters of a mile south of the road we moved out on on June 21, and my picket-line closely connects with its right.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
