Colonel H. L. ABBOT:

Four 10-inch mortar with a proper supply of ammunition are wanted in the battery near the Taylor house to control a battery of 32-pounder rifles just beyond the crest, distance from 1,200 to 1,500 yards. It would be well to get them out to-day ready to move; they may be ordered into battery to-night. I will inform you then whether to send them. Please answer.

HENRY J. HUNT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Artillery.

BROADWAY LANDING, VA., August 14, 1864-8.45 a. m.

Brigadier-General HUNT,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

Your dispatch in relation to mortars for Taylor house is received. Will make all preparations for forwarding to-night if you so direct.

BROADWAY LANDING, VA., August 14, 1864-10.30 a. m.

Brigadier-General HUNT,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac;

If the 10-inch mortars are ordered forward, I would earnestly request that they be put in the fourteen-gun battery where Pratt's 4 1/2 inch guns were. The range is essentially the same. The approach to this battery is very good, and to the old battery very bad, a matter of great importance in supplying 10-inch ammunition on account of its great weight; and, moreover, this battery is well made and the old battery very ill constructed, constantly caving under mortar fire.

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 14, 1864.

Colonel ABBOT:

It is not probable that the 10-inch mortars will be ordered up to-night. When they do come they are to go into the fourteen-gun battery near the Taylor house.

H. J. HUNT,

Brigadier-General.
