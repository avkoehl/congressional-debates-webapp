information in regard to Roddey, Ferguson, and Gholson. Will the command of General Tuttle protect the bridges at Cypress, Tuscumbia, and Hatchie? If I have to hold those bridges, my infantry force here will not be strengthened a man.

Tuttle's division, when it gets into position, will occupy the road to and including Chewalla. Your command, as relieved, will fall back on Corinth. It will take some days to get them all within places.

Major-General HALLECK,Washington, D. C.:

Movements of the enemy have been observed in our front since my last dispatch. The statements of deserters agree in this, that Longstreet has gone in direction of Knoxville. Cheatham had previously gone in that direction; has returned. Unreliable from of arrival of Johnston, Pemberton, and Hardee, with troops from Mobile, and the Vicksburg troops have been received. No demonstrations have been made by the enemy in Lookout Valley since the attack on Hooker on the 27th October.
