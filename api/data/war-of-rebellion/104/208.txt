HDQRS. ARMY AND DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,Near Spanish Fort, Ala., April 3, 1865.

Brigadier General JAMES C. VEATCH,

Commanding First Division, Thirteenth Corps, Origen Sibley's Mills:

SIR: The major-general commanding directs me to acknowledge the receipt of your communication addressed to him, dated this morning. Captain Thompson, your commissary of subsistence, was ordered yesterday afternoon to meet you at Origen Sibley's Mills with thirty wagon loads of subsistence and forage, being portion of the six days' supplies drawn by him yesterday morning. He reported that the supplies you had on hand would last you to include this evening; consequently the commanding general was led to suppose that without the one days' supplies in regimental trains you had enough to last up till this morning, and as your command will probably soon move back in its old position he deemed it advisable to leave the trains where they were. If on the receipt of this Captain Thompson has not yet joined the command you are authorized to send for the regimental trains.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

FIRST INDIANA BATTERY, April 3, 1865.

Captain EATON:

The ram and two transports have just passed out of sight up the Tensas. All quiet on Huger and Tracy. Our men seen on the right where the rebel battery was. The highest point in this vicinity is near this battery. From a tree I gained a good view west and south, but could not see much toward Blakely.
