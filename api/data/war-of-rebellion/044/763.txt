we charged them, driving them back through the woods, killing and capturing several. In this charge, we passed a column of the enemy's cavalry charging our battery near the church. This was attacked by a squadron under Lieutenant-Colonel Funsten, and repulsed with a slight loss on our side. The regiment was again formed in the woods, and the sharpshooters dismounted and dismounted and deployed in front, under Lieutenants [Joseph H.] Sherrard, Company H, and [William M.] Hockman, Company E. Both of these officers were severely wounded and brought to the rear, Lieutenant Hockman's wound proving fatal. I then moved the regiment to the support of a battery on our right, leaving the sharpshooters in front communicating with those of General W. H. F. Lee's brigade, on our left, but was ordered in a short time by the major-general commanding to attack the enemy's cavalry, now advancing from the right and rear of our present position. Moving rapidly in the direction of Brandy Station, I charged the enemy on the right of the Culpeper Court-House road, drove them across the railroad, capturing a battery of three guns and many prisoners. Observing a force of the enemy at Brandy Station, I moved toward that point, and found three regiments of cavalry, under Sir Perch Wyndham, plundering and destroying the property there. I charged, and drove them from the station, taking a stand of colors and many prisoners (among them a colonel), and pursued them some distance on the Stevensburg road. I was then ordered by the major-general commanding to advance upon Culpeper Court-House, and drive the enemy, reported to be there, from that point, and to place a picket on the Stevensburg road. I sent 200 men to Culpeper Court-House, and ascertained that no enemy had been there, and sent a squadron on the Stevensburg road. This squadron captured the enemy's picket of 14 men, and sent in during the evening 20 men. Our loss during the day was 5 killed and 11 wounded. Among the first was Lieutenant Hockman, Company E; and of the wounded are Major [M. D.] Ball, and Lieutenant Sherrard, Company H. The regiment captured, as far as the company commander can ascertain, 122 prisoners. Our loss in prisoners is small; the exact number not known (but does not exceed 5 or 6), as missing men are still reporting. A return of the property captured by the regiment accompanies this report. * The universal good conduct of officers and men need not be commented upon by me, as they were acting under the eye of both brigade and division commanders.
