MAJOR: If the engineer officers can go to-morrow noon and work rapidly on the Bayou Rapides road, they will be in time. Probably by Sunday noon Colonel Lucas' brigade will be 21 miles out on the road. I think Mr. Young should be habitually at headquarters with you. He can be sent with any special command when it may be deemed necessary or advisable.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

COLONEL: From all the information that I can gain, it will be necessary for you to furnish forage for two-thirds of the animals of this command after we reach Natchitoches, which will be within eight days from this date. In addition to the animals that marched here from Brashear City and Franklin and those that have been sent here by way of Red River, you will estimate for 1,000 more. There is now 7 feet of water on the rapids, and within the next week there will not be less than 6 feet, with the prospect of a greater depth.
