CAMP NEAR WALKERTON, June 18, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I have the honor to state, for the information of the major-general commanding, that the above dispatch* was started at 2 a. m. June 16, but the escort was unable to get thought. Since whiting the above dispatch I have been marching with my command down the north bank of the Mattapony River. My advance is to-night at Walkerton. I have taken this route, as my command was entirely out of rations and forage, and had to be subsisted off the country, and I knew that by crossing the river and moving down between the Pamunkey and Mattapony Rivers I could not supply myself.

In addition I have to state that I could find out nothing about supplies being left forme, either at the White House or West Point, and shall, therefore, have to line off the country until I can get some definite information. I am doing very well at present in the way of supplies, and think that I'll do better as I move on. I have sent forward to West point to make arrangements for rations, &amp;c., for my troops and to send off my wounded and prisoners of war.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
