Major-General BUTLER,

Fort Monroe:

If General Wild is in Currituck County,it would be well to send a steamer to Pongo to be in readiness to transfer the Ninety-eighth New York from that place to Coinjack Bridge or Northwest Landing, as may be most needed. I have sent a squadron of cavalry to South Mills to obtain information and watch the movements of the enemy. Commanders of posts have been instructed to afford all possible assistance to General Wild.
