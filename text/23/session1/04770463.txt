|     Mi THOMAS, of Louisiana, moved to amend
the amendment, by reducing the appropriation to
§50 000
Mr GARLAND opposed the amendment He
was not awaie of any íeason why the amount
fixed by tne committee should be reduced The
amount was requned to complete the work, and

Us progress The ra't mcieased annually about
three mile in length, and delay only increased ti e
expenses of lemoving it
Mi rilOM AS withdrew his motion
Mi HUBBARD was unwilling to go into a
discussion of this subject The sum proposed by
the depaitment to be applied to tms object was
>j25 000 TI e committee concluded to increase it
to s30, 00 Tl is sum, he believed, was all that
could be profitably expended oefoie the end of the
next session of Congress The object of the com-
mittee was to cirry on the works commenced If
the House should inciease appropnat ons upon
individual statements, it would be treading on un
safe giou id
Mr POLK said the amendments aided in the
con mi tee proposing additional appiopriations
whiei had nevei been examined by any commit
tee ammnted to ¥3 >0 000 We Had tne estimate
of the E gineei Uepaitn ent, cahmg foi $,°5 000
This was trom a íesponsible source, aid the
views of ndividuals, however respectable, could
not be coirpaied with this estimate as the basis of
action by the House
Mi HA WES hoped that eveiy gentleman who
wished to see the obstruction removed would, on
every principle of economy, support the amend-
ment This amount was now sufficient, but here-
after it might requne double the amount fiom the
continued increase of the obstruction
Mr VINTON had voted for the amendment,
but should vote against concurring in it The im-
provement was not for commercial purposes, but
it is intended to bung a large body of the bestcot-
ton land in the United States into the maiket In-
stead of bunging a price according to its value, by
the bill granting preemption rights, passed a few
days since, this land will not fetch more than one
dollar and twenty five cents per acie All the
motives for suppoiting the amendment had been
destroyed by that bill He should, therefore, vote
against the amendment
Mr McKINLEY was not in favor of large ap-
propuations generally, but sometimes sound econ-
omy required it From the statements of Mi
Shreve, whose practical acquaintance with this
subject rendered his opinions far more valuable
than those of any other engineer in the serviré, he
should support the amendment
Mr McK replied at length to the arguments
of Mr Vinton as to the effect of this improve-
ment
Mr LANE supported the amendment in com-
mittee, and should vote for it again, believing it
to be called for by good policy and economy,

measure
Mr EWING supported the amendment at
length
Mr SUTH ERLA ND thought it was much bet-
ter, if it was intended to pass the bill, to act upon
it These aigi ments had been heaid in the Com-
mittee of the Whole Unless the bill could be
acted on and sent to the Senate, it was futile to
take it up Gentlemen should lecollect that there
were but few days of the session left, and act ac-
coidmgly
Mr VINTON went into a further defence and
explanation of his views in opposition to the
amendment
Mr McKIM asked for the yeas and nays on
