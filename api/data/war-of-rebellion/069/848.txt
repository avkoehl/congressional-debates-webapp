HEADQUARTERS,Clark's House, May 29, 1864-6.45 a. m.

General BRECKINRIDGE:

GENERAL: I do not propose to move the troops to-day unless it becomes necessary. I wish you, therefore, to get all your men together, rest and refresh them as much as possible, and supply teem with ammunition, provisions, &amp;c. Be prepared to move should circumstances require it. I think it probable that should the enemy intend to advance from his present position on Richmond it will be by Haw's Shop to Atlee's Station. I have directed General Hill to be ready to support you. Take a position to resist his advance, acquaint yourself with the roads and country in your vicinity, and post your pickets to insure your security. Advise General Hill (at Shady Grove Church, on road from Atlee's to Mechanicsville) as well as myself of any movement against you.

Very respectfully,

R. E. LEE,

General.
HEADQUARTERS,Clark's House, May 29, 1864-3.10 p. m.

General BRECKINRIDGE:

GENERAL: Your note of 2.45 received. The general commanding directs me to say that General Early, with Ewell's corps, is on your right; he extends over toward Pole Green Church, and cannot be far from your right. Anderson (Kershaw is a part of First Corps) is in rear of Early, in reserve, and available for movements either way. The general does not think they will be able to or will attempt to pass between you and Early, but wishes you to be prepared and to hold the position you occupy. Have you your artillery with you?

Respectfully,

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Clark's, May 29, 1864-5 p. m.

Hill is on the road from Shady Grove Church to Hanover Court-House, and will advance to the point where it crosses Totopotomoy Creek. General Mahone will be immediately on your left along thee creek.

Respectfully,

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
