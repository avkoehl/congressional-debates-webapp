to-day more than some picket firing. The enemy is saucy, but got the worst of it yesterday, and will not press out pickets far. I will not be drawn out far unless with certainty of advantage, and I do not apprehend anything like an attack on our position.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

The main force of the enemy is at Corinth, with troops at different points east; also at Bethel, Jackson, and Humboldt are small garrisons. The numbers at these places seem to constantly change.

The number of the enemy at Corinth and within supporting distance of it cannot be far from 80,000 men. Information obtained through deserters place their force West at 200,000. One division of Buell's column arrived yesterday. General Buell will be here himself to-day. Some skirmishers took place with our outguards and the enemy's yesterday and day before.
