exceed, on the whole, twenty millions annually from customs
Nothing even now but the reduction of the free list, ard such
an adjustment as he had lately suggested, could justify the hope
that twenty three millions of revenue could be raised from cus
toma Togo beyond that, he considered utterly impossible
Duties may be raised as high as gentlemen please but they
Will not brim  in more revenue They will become prohiban
ry, buLnot productive In taxation the ordinary anthmetic of
two and two making four will i ot hold goo 1—f r the addition
commonly makes but one Then, as not more than twe ¡ty
three millions of revenue can be raise J to sustain the Govern
ment, which is expending twenty « x trillions how ran capita
lists be satisfied thatthe public faith can be available as &ecu
rity for their loans? The only corfidence that can be infused
into them is that inspired by a specific p edge of the pro eeds
of the public lands and tht-determination of the Governirent to
adjust its expenditures according to i a actual means
He next advetsedto the modifi ation of the fourth sec ion
of the bill as proposed by the chairman oí the Committee on
Finance, and, although the disapproved of the who e plan of
advertising the credit of the Government to the mghcst biüder
he thought the modification a great improvement
In conclusion he invoked his fiierds—those with whom he
generally acted—to come forward m support of th? amend
mentofferedby the ¡senator from Mississippi [Mr Walker]
He called upon them u l.o it as.a matter of inevitable recessity,
even though at variance with the estao] s led opinions as to the
rights of the States He told them thai it was the only effec
tual mean** of saving the Gjvernment from degradatim the
only means of insuring unanimity of councils—and the only
means of settling the increasing cgitatioti of the question of
repeal

Kentucky [Mr U>uju wood ] m the f\st appropriation bill m
relation to the post office at New York, had" brought into the
Treasury &15 OOfi—enough to pay the salary of the Postmaster
General anil all his assistants—lfthis amendment were carried,
enough would he broughtmto the treasury to pay the eaiary of
two judges of the United States Cireuit Court, besides allowing
tlecleik district attorney and marshal a large and libera* eom-
f ensation lor their services If however, it should be ruled out,
án ' if the question of oi der was to ride down every proposition
for retrei chment and reform he should have the satisfaction of
knowing that he had done his duty in presenting the subject to
the attention of the committee and the judgment of the country.
Mr GWIN wished to make a single remark jn reply to the
gentleman from ÍNew York [Mi Fiixmore ] -who referred to
the amount of fees lecened by the officers of the United States
courts m Mississippi    *
Th'1 increase oí business in the United Stafes courts in that
3 ate after 18^7 was enormous Atore term of the United
States court for the {southern District of Mississippi there were
upwar Is of twenty eight hundred cases on the docket involving
some ei^htorten millions of dollars m controversy between the
plaintiffs and defendants This amount of business included
but one of the twoterms*of the court annually held m-that State
I o execute the process emanating from the court, required on
the part ot the marshal the employment of a great number of
a«si;> ants and his expenses on this account alone, for the year
alluded to by hegenlemai from New Yoik exceeded fifty
th usand dollars The expenses incurred by the clerk during
the same year <or the employment of deputy clerks exceeded
ten thousand dollars and still hi*f records weie not kept up with
the increase of the business This vast increase of business,
incurring such enonnous expenditures andTesponsibilities was
an njury instead of an advantage to those officers, and them
crease was caused hy the in Ipbtedness of citizens of Mississippi
to citizensot other btates The nun b r of suit4' (said Mr G )
has greatly decreased and I do not believe they have amounted
to five hm dred in twelve oi eighteen months m that district
But I feci bound to say that from5 personal expenencej I am
conn" lent that neither the clerks nor marshals in Mississippi can
peri  rm the duties of their offices and m«ike a dolfaf after pay
ing expe sea under the law of 1811 Ikrojv not how the law
