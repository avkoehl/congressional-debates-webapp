Major-General BURNSIDE:

Your dispatch of 27th received. Surprised that you don't come to our assistance. We want you on our left flank, with all you can spare west of the Tennessee. If we are driven from Tennessee, you can't stay in East Tennessee. If the enemy are driven, it will be easy to hold it. Have sent you four dispatches within the last six days.

W. S. ROSECRANS,
