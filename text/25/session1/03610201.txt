25tli Coj G....lst Sess.                            Inexpedient to charter a National Bank—Mr. Sergeant.                                  H. of Reps.
rants of the Gov ernment, even of members of Con
gress    Without meddling with the fact "whether it
was proper to pay them m specie 01 not, I will
state that I remembar tne time when  membeisof
Congress were paid in the paper oí the District of
Columbia then depreciated twenty per cent below
specie, and they were satisfied, and when, for the
remaindei of that session, according to my recol-
lection, they were paid m Tieasuiy n >tvs  also be
low par as compared with specie     I say, theiefore,
the publication of the Secretar)'*, letter was unfor
tímate, because it leads immediate]) to the inquiry
now set on foot
Suppose a workman in jour navy yard who is
said to be paid in the common can en cy of the place,
receives ¿2 00 per da), which is nominally one
fourth oí the pas of a member of Congress    Does
he  actually  iceeivo that proportion 1     His com-
pensa ion íor six days, if he  received the whole
amount, w ould be $13 20    What do°s he ac ually
get1    Iwelve  dollars    What do  we get1    We
get $8 80 per day    You may calculate this for
six days   and s e what the difference would be
Of this I will speak hereafter    Now this is a letter
which presents itself every where throughout the
country, and at all times, and allow me to say, that
it is the most disagreeable feature mthe whole ugly
face which our financial affairs now bear    It pre-
sents itself to all classes in eveiy condition thiough
out the country, anclas ii there had been a iear
that that condition would not have been sufficiently
seen and felt, we have  this iormal annunciation
published to make it the more striking    I regret
very  much that such a publication was made
And sir it presen's itself in a manner even moie
odious than any I hav e yet adverted to—m a man
ner mto'erabl)   olious   which cannot be  home,
which will not be boine    Sil  let ire ask is not

man  of the  Comm ttee if Ways an 1 Means mis
apprehended me if  he   s ipposed that   in the in
stance I s ate I to him I m^ant to piove that the
Treasury was whollv desutute of means available
or unavailable    I did not mean that    I meant to
say that it was destitute of the meansoi doing equal
justice to all who have claims upon the Treasury,
and the state ot the case is sufficient to es abhsh that
fact sausf ictorily    Sir here was a claim upon the
Government of ©311 00 perhaps it ma) be twice as
much as rm   per die n  allowance  and tr"velw 11
co ii" to 1 >r tnis shu  scs ion     An oulei  wis sent
to that ere h oi to íc uve it from a n n sicci   pay
mg bank   that is to sa    in bank paper chyretntcd
below specie, o   above which specie hid been ai
preciated, it matteit> not which    Could he get pay
ment of thatordw m specie1    He coul I no      He
then sends back the draft to the Treasury, and tells
the Treasure! he wants specie    He said he had
a heavy account for postages from month to month,
and he thought the least that ought to be done vv as
to pay ihat small sum, for advances to the  State
Depaitment   in  that I ind   of monev   in which he
paid his postages     The answer was they could not
pay him in specie otherw iso than  bv " v mg him
diafts upon a public leceiver m Ohio    That sir,
was the case of a public cred tor, and it so must
happen continually
How   wihout impeaching the   conduct  or the
inteii ion of anv ofhcci   oí the Government what
evci, is it not obvious tha' it becomes   sooner or
later,  th" inteiest oí   the  officers of  the Govera
ment to continue this state  ot tlnngs I    Because it
is, an advantage to them as hey will be paid m bet
ter com ant1 in a better currency    The) are near-
er to the Treasut)     They have mote k ion ledge
and have the means of ob ammg perhaps are ent
tied to, the priorit)   m the payment and whatevei
advantages are to be secured will be   ecured to
them
Sir, what do you cieate m them bv ihis state of
things1     You are cieating  an  interest   m >oui
officers of the Government advcise to the interests
of the people and adverse to the common claims of
justice   an interest which makes it tor then advan
tage that this differencebetween what the) iceive
and w hat is paid to others, should not onl) bp des
troyed, bat even should be increased    Su it is the
interest of the Government, therefore not to cor
rech but to corumue these disorders    They gam an
augmentation of th°ir salaries without any appro
pna'ion by, or without the assent of, Congress, that
is, the whole amount of difference between paper
and specie paid to any other person performing the
same service orat the same nominal salar) This,
I say is intolerable It cannot be born- It will
not be boine Sir, what is remarkable is that this
being an ev il mamlestl) oí great consequence, and
attended w ith very great danger you have not a
single proposition for the rebel of it The only pro
position you have is to let it continue I maintain
that what is called the sub treasury s)stern, though
I know it would be irregular to anticipate the dis
cussion of that question now is no system at all
It is a call upon Congress to legalize that state of
things which has grow n out of the suspension of
specie payments and to secure and peipetuate foi
ever the payment of the officers of the Government
in specie, leaving it to the people to manage as they
can with a debased an 1 depreciated cm i enc) In-
deed, we have been told that this scheme exists al
ready in the present state uf things
This, sir, is extiaordmary, very extraordmaiy
How is it to restore one weight and one measure
throughout the country1—a thing that you want,
that is indispe lsaole — a thins in which  from the
beg nnmg of time down to the present day, has
been deemed in hsptnsable to every people   that
there should be uniformity    But I know it is cal
led bv another name, perhaps a propei name    It
is called a divorce from the banks—a divorce from
the banks'    That is to sav  the Government lila
contracted   an   alliance    which  every  one  who
thought upon the subject told them would be attend
ed with clanger with mjuiy   and finally wit i the
neces itv   of some sort of separation     What w as
predicted has come to pass  and then the) cill fot
a S)stem of divorce   when  m fact  the s"paiation
has already taken place     That   however   is not
the point upon which I am going to discuss the
manei     Ido not au. upon m\ elf he e torn pine

mf;  that is foreign to the pie"=ent purpose torn    j
quire1   But sir   I say it is not a divorce of the   |
Government from  banks    It i  a divnce of the
Government from the people   and that ts a dn oi ce
which has already  talen pi ice—a divorce from
bed and board     Sir the Government and the peo
pie no longer sit down to Hie «ame table—they no
longei feed upon the same food     The difference
b twun them is ten percent     Andwhil   the o  <•

verted   what is i* we aie called upon by this reso
lution to tío1   Whv   o givesecunt) to the Gov
ernment that this state of things sha 1 continue
that it shall be perpetuated  that it «hall be fasten
ed upon the people for whereas, many intelligent
and patriotic people in the United States do believe
hat a bank emilojed as the fiscal agent of the
Government, and stiengthened by the support of
the Government, would at once restore the pay-
ment ol specie, and put all classes oí citizens upon
an equal looting We are called upon, by this re-
solution, to declare this snail ncvei be We must,
a^ it wete all come up and put our hand awn the
book, to declare it hereafter settled and fixed that
there is to be no bank We are as it were, to take
an oath, to give a pledge tha* there shah be no
bank
Let it, then be demonstiated ever so clea ly that
a national bank would have its effect, would fur-
nish a remedy that it would remove this crying
evil which ought not to exist and cannot he per-
mitted to exist, yet that that is not to b  thought of
as an expedient and what then f lliws1 Precisely
w hat I tol' ) on— h at i ti e. ü i  to be perpetuated,
and s°cur ) given to t> e government by this reso-
lution that it shall be perpetuated 1 ask the chair-
man of the Committee ol Wais and Means wheth-
er that is one of the measures of lelief for which
this extra session of Congress was called1 How
is it to be that this resolution is to operate to the
relief of the people fiom ihe distresses and difficul-
ties they ate now laboring under "> But the sub
Ucasuiy scheme I suppose will have its turn, and,
theieiore, I will say no moie now than that it ap-
pear to me among those evils calculated to make
the present sta e of things everla ing
