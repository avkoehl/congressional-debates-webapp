WARRENTON JUNCTION, May 3, 1864.

General MEADE:

General Grant asked me if the horses for the Twenty-second New York would not be of more service to you in mounting some of your veterans than to me. I think they will. Where shall I send them?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

General Burnside has been requested to send the horses at once to Brandy Station, and that you would have an officer to receive them. I have also asked him to report the number of animals and equipments. If you desire you can meet them at Rappahannock Station.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

GEO. G. MEADE,
