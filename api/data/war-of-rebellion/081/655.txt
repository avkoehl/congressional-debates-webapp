DUNLOP'S HOUSE, June 15, 1864.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

There is good crossing for pontoon bridges one mile below Chaffin's and half a mile above mouth Kingsland Creek. Cannot one be constructed there forthwith to communicate more directly with Lee's army?

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

DUNLOP'S HOUSE, June 15, 1864 - 7 a. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

Return of Butler's forces sent to Grant, and arrival of latter at Harrison's Landing renders my position more critical than ever; if not re-enforced immediately enemy could force my lines at Bermuda Hundred Neck, capture Battery Dantzler, now nearly ready, or take Petersburg, before any troops from Lee's army or Drewry's Bluff could arrive in time. Can anything be done in the matter?

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

SWIFT CREEK, June 15, 1864 - 9 a. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

General Dearing reports at 7.35 a. m.:

Enemy is still in our front in force; reported advancing in heavy force on Broadway road. A prisoners says some of Burnside's troops are there.

If so, it is very important.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

SWIFT CREEK, June 15, 1864 - 9.30 a. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

General Dearing, from south side of Appomattox, reports enemy have attacked my outposts in force. Prisoners state there are four regiments of infantry and four of cavalry close behind. They say it is an "on to Petersburg" and more force behind.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

SWIFT CREEK, June 15, 1864 - 10 a. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

Two members of our signal corps captured at Coggins Point yesterday have escaped, and report that from 2 p. m. until sunset twelve transports of enemy had passed up crowded with troops.
