MEMPHIS, September 28, 1863.

Commanding Officers along the Railroad:

Notify your troops to watch carefully every bridge and trestle, and to see that they are perfectly secure for the passage of trains with troops. Examine each several times a day.

LA GRANGE, September 28, 1863.

COMMANDING OFFICER, Pocahontas:

See that the troops of your command stationed at or near bridges keep a vigilant watch of the same by examining them closely several times during the day and night. Trains loaded with troops will be passing for some time to come.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Chattanooga, Tenn.:

You can perhaps communicate with General Burnside more rapidly by sending telegrams directly to him at Knoxville. Think of it. I send a like dispatch to him.

A. LINCOLN.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, September 28, 1863-10.30 a.m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Chattanooga, Tenn.:

Grant's forces were ordered to move, by Memphis, Corinth, and Tuscumbia, to Decatur, and thence, as might be found necessary, to co-operate with you. Supplies were to be collected at Corinth before their arrival. As the rolling-stock is only sufficient to carry baggage and supplies, the troops must march the whole distance. The order was received on the 18th, and the steamers sent to Vicksburg to bring up the troops. They calculated to be able to communicate with you in fourteen days from that time. Since then nothing has been heard of them, there being no telegraph line. The troops from here will probably reach you first.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
