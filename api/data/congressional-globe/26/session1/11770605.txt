P3U
as it has been carried on since 1816, is as effectually
so as if such a law was enacted afcd enforced. I
tsarefore appeal to the caBdor of all, wlie-
thef it's not a taxation of more than three fourths
of the American people^ for the bettefit of less than
one foBrthv and if it a not éank injustice, which  if ,
p^veied la, must lead to oppression, or to resis-
tance?
Batthis system has failed to protect themanu-
factoring interest of • the country^ Thfi, American
people have acquiesced in the different tariffs, and
purchased their goods, on which they have paid
their tax* to lb* General CtofeMttteat in the Bian-
ner I ba e showttj with a patriar  spirit and be-
lrer, th t ibitee tariffo wer« preventing theflountry
f#ro being ifnftiatsd with British goods, and
«o«M eafbte th% American manufacturer to ?eH at
soeh rates afe to prtveat his being unoVréoW and
broke  down by tno iroportei of English fabrics.
Sach however has not been the fact, as will appear
fromT&tt ftHo mf "iW* -          -
' Thir tabic is from facts reported to Congress,
aid tells toore truths than any theWy can. It the
eiperMSnee ol'tni pas', by whuh is shown, that un-
der each pjotecfete tariff, there was a much larger
amount of'gmíds tmfoítea frote fibroid, and con-
natíéká ifi thtf'coaiitry,' than, al. Its products which,
«■ete éxisÓTtea of scat out. • ít also shows that the
higher 'the lariff was raised, the "greater was, the
«eras of imports ovar exports, and the more the
«BtÜrfwai'gettiÉg Wdébt.' * ' ' r " ' '
The b4t«ace is tw*n,ry.©lIe, ye%f¥ amounts to1
upwards of ^23^,000,000; and mora than ope-
half of this accrued under the last protective
tariff, and within five years. Add to this th*
excess of specie imported ovp^what was exponed
from 1825 to 1838, and deduct from the whole
excess the reasonable profit for carrying in Ame-
rican vessels, and-lhe balance .again-1 the country,
now unpaid, will be found about equal to all the
deits of the Sta'es. Now, who pays this hatence?
It rnukt come from the earnings of the laboring
classes.                                                       '
The following brief considerations show why the
system has to operated. First, the facility of pay-
ing for foreign goods, and effecting exchanges
abroad, through the State*6tocks, in correction
with the Bank of tba United States, a  hereafter
shown. Secondly, thje erpd£ Which'has been given
to importers for their duties. This credit part o'

a foanh reason; araec from' theiafiatiou of the papar
cirrulatica of the country^ These' coniiderauons,
1 think¿show this objection, like most others, better
calculated to H  liad tfcrin to rn'ighien. And I
think 1 have also shown whysh is, aid nimt eon-
tinue tobe, theirripotlantinterest in thücountryvand
that the system of high tariff  whífch te  «6 .vgnaWy
failed to protect the country against excessive ia .
per'ations, has tenr'ed to-such heavy and unequal
taxa ion, th*t it should hot be renewed; and that
-the paper circulation, as used in this country, has
not, arid cannot, «aren by riving to the. bank* the
ase of the public money; benefit the true commer-
cial and manufacturing inte rests cf the country.
In. doing so^I dfesiertoi be understood distifioiy as
«Ot! opposing the interests of any section of this
country, but, on tn-i contrary, as desiring the pros-
perity <>f alb But I oppose a system whkh leads
to uneqaal legislation and oppresmvftt&xation. Ita
the bill now under consiieraiicn I «ee a preventa-
tive to sach consequences by a system of fiscal ope-
rations provided for the Government. I see in it
no war upon baaksop bankers, but a «imp'e resist-
ance to their encroachments upon the rights of the
laboring and pr^ducirg cl's-es, and a separation
of those modern money making institutions, from
the! Government, and leaving them without any
anjafct advantages, to th^ use of their capital-lor
true commercial and manufacturing purposes.
' fíáving examined the principles of the bill under
consideration, and the «most prominent objections
ttrged against it, I propose now briefly tn examine
the antagonist system—a Bank of the United
B^Ues.   There new remains no doubt thit  roe

Opposition party of thih House, an I their lead rs
ihiodgliout ih' country, are hi (nvor of, and will,
if they can defeat ihe present Administration, re-
charter a-.other Bank, simi'ar to those heretpfoie
tried. Each memb'-r has f>r himself so avowed,
and has en'ered 11 o an examination of the merits
of tuch an ins'itu ion; ¡n opposition to the pi^sent
bill.
I shall not, howpver, now iroub'e the committee
with any examma'K n as ¡o ,he t\)i¡t>trntionality of
such an in*tumion, but confina m>seif to its expe-
diency only.
When ihe names of great and venerated men,
such as Washing oi and Madis n, are introduced
as nuthority m í.ivor ot s ach an .ns'itution, I de-
sire the coairr>ittee, a- l thtou^h ih-m, the Ameri-
can p-opie, to cons dcr th'Cir uinstances under
which ,neoc grent and g> od men acted.
In 1791, under ih« present Constitution, this Go-
vernment had a n Uiocal debt of §75,463,476, which
had bean incurred m that arlnous and rrotracted
struggle of the Revolution, waich resu'ied so glo-
riously in cur independence. This debt had to
be, provided for ; embarrassment and distress
met the infant Government at i's very incep-
tion, and taxed the in?enu;ty and patriotism or those
whp had persevered in the mighty conflict, and were
still determined lq snuggle into greater political ex-
istence. Of these, no iruu had felt or suffered
more than General Washington, a,nd nene more
fervently desired to see the new born Constitution
rLe and live abo^e the difficulties that had brought
it into existence. The resources of the country
were rettricud, and the puce-.* of raising money
for relief, by sales of the public land*, with the ma-
jority was deemed too slew, and a National Bank,
in pnnciplei similar to.the Bank of England, was
the lesoit.
On the 25 h of February, 1791, General Wash-
ington, after great deliberation, in which, no doubt,
the embarrassed condition of his beloved country
passed in anxious review, stcned the charter tor
the first Bank of the United States. It. capital
was $10,0X10,000, one-fourth of which wae re-
quired (bul was not done) to be paid in specie, and
three-fourths in ttie national debt. The paper is-
sued by tbe bank was received for publ c duts.and
the mr>ney of ihe Government va> dtposited with
it. Thuv, tbe debt winch the country owed, con-
stituted three f u-ths of ihj capi al ot tr,e bank; on
which ttie in crest c< irir.utd to run, but which be-
came a baois for ihe is^ia cf paper money. By
this the Government had a means of bonowing pa-
per.money, which was increased through the bank,
an#was r«lieved from the immediate payment Of
that auiountof the pub'ic debt which became bink
capi al. "Ihe creditor or holder of the Government
debt continued to draw interest as before, and had
the power to issue paper upon it, with the addi-
tional u.>e of the puolio money. Tni5 was a most
advantageous system to the stnckh-ilders, but af-
forded to the Government that temporary relief
which it so much needed.
The charter of this Bank expired March the 4A,
1811. At this time the resouices of the country
were greatly developed—tbe national debtmach re-
duced—the Governm:nt re'ieved from its con-
sequent embarrassment, an I Congress, by the vote?
of the country, refuse 1 to recharter the institution.
In 1812 the second war with Great Britain Was
declared, whilst Mr. Madison, another one of ibose
great and good men whose memories Americaas
venerate, was President. Thi< second struggle fat
independence increased the national debt, $68,57*/ -
764; and in 1816, the Government four d itself again
préswddown with the sum of $123,639,692. Mr.
Madisorrfound his coat.fy then, in precrefy, the
same situa'km, thit General Washington did in
1791, and. frcm Miniar cairas. The pub ic lands
had begun to fttch in some revenue, but stdl insuf-
ficient to meat the wan's of the Government.
Under these circumstances Mr. Madison «igned
thecharter for the secon-4 ban>, April 1% 1816.
The capital M this bank, whs $35,000,000; of which
one-fifth was required in specie, ?ad four-fifths au-
thorized to be, paid, in, the. «at'oaal debt, opon the
same principles of the first bank;.and likeiuiperated
to give tmMemporary relief so much seeded. Frona
