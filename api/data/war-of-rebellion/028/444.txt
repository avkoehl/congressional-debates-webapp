[CHAP. XXXI.

may purposely leave Washington exposed, to be attacked by the full force of the enemy. In the first case, he may withdraw nearly all the troops; in the second, he must leave a large force inside the lines of Washington. We cannot count, however, upon the matter being regulated in this way, and the authorities in Washington will allays have to exercise a discretion, so as neither uselessly to tie up forces needed in the field or expose Washington to danger.

Under present circumstances, I should not advise the reduction of the garrison of the Chain Bridge position below its present standard. If the four companies of the Fourth New York Artillery be sent over (they can be spared from Colonel Haskins' lines) to constitute a garrison for Fort Ethan Allen (there would then be more artillerymen than are needed), one of the three regiments might perhaps be spared. It would be better to keep the three regiments there.

I am, very respectfully, your most obedient,

J. G. Barnard,

Brigadier-General and Chief Engineer.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 18, 1862-10 a.m. (Received 11 a.m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I earnestly request that the One hundred and forty-sixth Regiment New York Volunteers, Colonel Kenner Garrard, may be ordered to report to me. I desire to assign it to Warren's brigade, Sykes' division, Porter's corps. This regiment was to have left New York about the 12th instant. If, however, it has not yet passed through Baltimore, in the event of my application being granted, would it not be well to have the order sending it here meet it at Baltimore?

Please inform me whether I can have this regiment. I am anxious to complete the organization of Warren's brigade as soon as possible, and shall be much gratified if Colonel Garrard's regiment can be placed at my disposal for assignment to it.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 18, 1862-1 p.m. (Received 1.05 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

General Porter left for Washington this morning, and General Morell has been ordered to go at once. This leaves the army corps with only three general officers. The officers mentioned in my dispatch of last night should be sent back immediately. I have learned to-day that a force of from 4,000 to 6,000 rebel troops have gone to Hedgesville, and it is reported their purpose is to destroy the tunnel at Paw Paw, and probably do other damage to the railroad. I have ordered a division of Franklin's corps to march at once up the river, and all of Kelley's disposable troops to come down by rail and endeavor to defeat the purposes of these rebels.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
