ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington, May 26, 1862.

Governor ISRAEL WASHBURN,

Augusta, Me.:

Enlist no more three-months" men. Only three-years" men are needed. Please report how many three-months" men you have enlisted.

By order of the Secretary of War:

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

AUGUSTA, May 26, 1862.

General THOMAS:

Hae part of regiment of three-months" men. Shall it be filled? If not, cannot send any men immediately, as we have no organized militia amounting to anything. No full companies of three-months" men are yet enlisted. What I have can be easily discharged. Three-years" regiment is filling up well.

I. WASHBURN, JR.

BOSTON, May 26, 1862.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Please telegraphed authority to commission again Francis J. Parker, who resigned mayorship of Fort Warren battalion, and was discharged May 22. Have you any more from Banks? Our people are rushing as in April, 1861. They will repeat the enthusiasm and glory of Lexington and Baltimore.

JOHN A. ANDREW.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., May 26, 1862.

Governor ANDREW,

Boston, Mass.:

You are authorized to commission again Francis J. Parker. General Banks stated in a dispatch received this morning, dated at Williamsport, that his force was then crossing the river in good order and excellent spirits, and that he expected to save everything. Four days ago I nominated Gordon for brigadier, and he appears to have won it nobly. Banks and his officers have conducted his operations gallantly.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

P. S.-Just as I signed the above a telegram received from General Banks says, "Everything of importance safe-guns, ordnance trains, and nearly all the baggage trains."

E. M. STANTON.

BOSTON, May 26, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

We have sent six companies of volunteers under Lieutenant-Colonel Parker to-night. Shall send battery at 5 a. m. to-morrow. I have 2,000 militia in town which we hope to send to-morrow evening.

JOHN A. ANDREW,

Governor.
