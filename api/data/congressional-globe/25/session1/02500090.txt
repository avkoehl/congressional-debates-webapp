He spoke of their eme^ prise and perseverance,
skill md success m trade, and I feel a pride m their
character as citizens of my own country    Sir, I
knew that they had taken to themselves wings and
flown to the uttermost parts ot the earth, and over
the most drearv and dangerous regions of the sea
He said they were m gieat distress, and I was sor-
rowful to the heai t that they should be so   I ha ve in-
quired into the cattle of that distress, and understand
that, m a regular course of trade, they endeavoi cd to
purchase the produce e f the faimer and planter—of
my constituents, who are farmers and planters—at
a price at which they could make a profit, an 1 b°
hold they made a loss, and were obliged to sell ft t
hali what they gave     It they had made a pi on , as
they anticipated, we should hate heard nothing of
their afflictions, they have made a haid bed ioi
themselves, and then futhful and talented represen
tative argues, as I understand the eficct of his pro
position to have a United States Dank, oi, idthei
the same one recharteied, to taKe his constituents
oiF that hard bed and put mine on    Now, sii, I hat e
regard for the merchants, as I have ioi all the citi-
zens of the Uni'ed States   but tt hen the question is
simply, w hether his constituents shall lie on this
hard bed of their own nakmg or mine shall  when
the question is s mply betw een his constituents and
mine, it hich shall oe in affliction, I prefei  mme

it would relieve the people, or even the merchants

Sir, I am against selling the people out m this way,
either by the help of a Bank of the United States,
or ttithout it, in order to make a better cuneney
foi mcrchams and travel'ers, or for the next gene

like, until the bank note is lost it ,loeo not press as
haid as for one to lose all, and be sold out Let

buy your tt hole estate, worth one hunched thousand

cur tj depends whjlly  in good times or bad times,
upon th  accidental circumstance of a'l their cre-
ditors, or even of less than a motety of them, call-
ing upon the banks all at once     When,  then,
there is such a demand for specie to pay this great
debt abroad, and when there is one great corpora-
tion with such vast lesourcc  still clinging to the
name of Bank of the United Stafes   endeavoring
to convince us bj all possible means—1 will say aU
piopei means—that she alone can keep on a good
currency, and when there is a powerful par y fully
peisuaded, and by all laudable means endeat onng
to show that this Admmisti ation h is pi oc'uc ed, and
is producing confusion and mischief m  all our
fiscal concerns, is it strange that «o many should
call at once that these banks cannot pay specie for
their notes i Certainly it is no     and the peop'e do
not consider it strange    Then notes, m tneir íe-
spective   districts, will buy more property than
specie would hate bought lasi year    This shows
the people aie not suipuscd or alarme 1 "t the tact
oí their stopping payment of specie    Yet, we aie
told by gentlemen, that there is great distress, and
it is intimated that theie is no relief but by a Bank
of the United Stales   Where is the distiess1 What
is il i The^e land specula tots and m-i chants have
bougnt at high prices and sold at low puces   They
have often bought at low prices and soid it high
prices, and have stopped payment, and the banks
stop ed paying specie, but not making money by
shaving the people    Tiavelleis are pestered with
shin-plasters, yet, the bulk of the people aie yet
unhurt, except by the dread, that, by a Bank of the
United States being cieated, or m some other way,
their paper contracts tt ill be forced to be adpastecl
m specie, and thus sell their property foi  little oi
nothing, as tas clone in 1818, 181'),and 1820, and to
make a nice curicncy   Sir, the Bank of the United
States then made it, hut how and at what expense 1
It was my hard foitune to taste some of the bi ter
ft uits of relief then offered and now offered, by a
Bank of the United States    Hating encouraged
speculation in that day, as banks hav e clone in this
day, so much that the president was so disapprov-
ed of  that he  tvas dismissed   anel ano bei  one
chosen    That bank began to make a good cur-
rency , such an one as is now offered us, having
less specie than almost anv other bank of any cie-
dit m hei vaults, but, backed by the Congress of
the United Slates, and the receipts of the revenue
of the United States, lo the amount 0j some twenty
or moie millions she leepured all other banks, but
herself, to pay specie n eedmg not to do it herself ex-
cept nominally, because she had .he leceipt and
disbursement of the revenue    Her stock stood at
something 1 ke an hundred and fifty , and that of a
bank, having more specie, and under better man-
agement, sunk to sixty     Then l'was, sir, that the
State banks, being called on to resume specie pay-
ments, which could be done in no t\ ay but by diaw -
mg in their own notes to giv e place lor some iett m
piopottion   ot   the   United   States  Bank    that  I
