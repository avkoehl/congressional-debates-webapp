Changes, would he not real'y place it out of the possession of
Congress, where a change might be made every sessior? But
this Congress might district hall the States, and at the next pes

was desired? Underthese circumstances, was it proper to take
such power from the Legislatuie& oft ie States,when hey weie
as trustworthy and as huriets', politically or o herwibe, ds the
members of this House?
But if they had the right to exercse this power m pau, and
then stop; they would nave the light to go a little further and
then stop, leavingtheS ates tocomp'ate the woik And sup
pose they should pass a la?- dibtrictin* half thu States, could
they s'op there? Cleai ly they could not Who w a& there that
could legitimately, under the Cons ituuon, turner d for fcULh a
thing as that? I here were many a guments u&ed m favor "f
the district system, one used by the gentle an f*om ^oulh Ca
rolma,wl ith was amplified by some o'heis, was, that thp d,ze
States might combine and control the legislation of this Ilou&e,
but this was true of the one system, whethei custuct 01 general
ticket, as the cher Under the señera! ticket system, they
had at leas  he State ^presented, which, uider the distnet
system, might not be Take he case of Alabama, which was
Opposed to the measures of the Whig General Adm mstration

the effect of disfranchising the majority of that State, of e gin
thousandor ten thousand votéis Bul ltwassail that the gen
eral ticket system would necessarily introduce the caucus &ys
tern, but, he asked, if the caucus or convention sv stem was not
in use m all the States where there is any pat ticular warmth of
political feeling, and it had no more connexion with the gen
eral ticket system than with the district system Wherever
parties approximated to an equah y and political fcuht -h ran
high, the caucus system would exist It hfd beca islied, if
Congress had not the powei to say that, in those States w either
a majority of the whole was recaed to elect a member of c u
gress, a plurality shall elect True V might, DUt their legisla
tion would not be complete if they merely directed the State
how to act, or if any thing were left for the Sta e '.> do Sup*
pose, then, when Congress has Jeteimined thr apportiunnieut
of members to each State, and und rthe^ertr3' ncke* system
a State should send a membei more than the number to
which it was entitled, woal it be m the power of Con
gresa to say which of tho e nwnbeis should go nomc'1
And suppose Urn S ate shoald lav off a d strict more than
she was entitled to, could Congress d°teiiriue which of
those members should gi until ( euaiidy fot, fur they ail
came here under the same commission, an t the ame 'bioad
seal " Hence, then, the necessity that Congress should have the
power to carry oiu the hw fully n all l's bmches, if h at
tempted to mteifere But was mere a membei ot this flojse
from one "State thaj, knew enough about the other State* to en
able him to d strict those S ates1* TSere v>as great difficulty in
distnctmgevei the States wit i which they weie acqua need,
and in which they 1 ved, but it wa^ a mat er aoout which the
States could ac* more unde^tandirgly, he^ce the propriety of
leaving it to the States The honoiab'e gentleman then leplied
to some reraaiks which had been ma ie respect mg the adoption
of the genial ticket system in Alabama, and cone!  ^ed by ob
serving that he should vote against the pioposn.onbefoie the
committee He should vote ^ gainst it as ongmally proposed by
the chairman of the Committee of Elections, or¿s modified by
the adoption of th** amendment, which he was astonshea to
find that the chairman of the committee had tl ought pi oper to
accept
Mr KENNEDY, of Indiana, obtained the floor, but yielded
to a motion that the committee rise, which mo ion, by a\ es 57,
noes 69, was rejected
So the committee refused to rise
Mr KENJNEDY, of Indiana looktd upon this question,
trivial as it might appeal 11 the eyes of n any menr-e-* o the
commute^, as^the mo°t mportanttha had been sprung since
he had been a metiber of Cor^if^s I invo'ved the very im
pdrtant question whetKrtheG iieralGovernmentshould now
commence tl e exercise of a pow i which might not be dele
gated to urn the Cot stitution oi, if it was, had lam dormant
lor ffiy years It wa« that which ma le theques ion an import
ant one, and he had hoped that i cojld have been discussed
and acted on without their hearing anv cant about Democracy
or any thing el&e he had I oped tl a' it would have been dis
rushed as an American question without reference cithci to
Whigs or Democrats, m a party sen«e TlvU he m ght be dis
tinctly understood he set it down, mtheojt«et, asa clear and
undeniable proposition, thit Congress could exercise no poweis
except tho e delegated by the C institution, and, further, that
■whatevef poweis might be delegated m the 4th section never
were intended to be exeici^td, unless it became in h^pensably
necessary to the preservation of th< Government itself m con
sequence of the States' refusing or neglecting to provide for the
election of their Representatives Therefore, ll the power
was t) be found m the Constitution to district the States at all,
it wasnece^saiy befóte U could be exein&ed hatthe state of
thing  which it was given to teniedy should arnve But he
went farther be believed that all (.ht powus given to Corsiesa
14 the 4th section of the Constitution even upon the happening
of the event he hadiduled to, did nut me! ide the power fa lay-
off the Sates into distutts He was aware that he was takirg
grounds that much ibler and mon expeiieT-cd men than him
self contended were untenable but he firmly believed in the
correctness of the opini ns he had lorried, ard had heard no
thing yeuhat shook his coirdi.net. in them
The powers That Congress mi<*ht e\eici&e in re1 a ion to mem
bereof Conetess in the Mate* a given by the Constitution re
ferred to thiee dungs, v i the ti e place, ind mannei of hold
ing the e et lions Mow he he u that undei a correct definition
of the words ' time place and manner" ll p pow°r to lay off
the States into districts was not inclti led The gei tleman fiom
Virginia [Mr Summers] made a strong argument n tavor of
this power, and he put a strong case, and said that if Congress
did not possess the power the States themselves did not, he
cause the terms "time, place, and manner,' embraced all the
authority under win<**i they (ths States) exercised it.   Now the
answer to this was plain He averred that if the S ates had not
the power independent of that clause in the Constitution, they
had it not with it He would ask gentlemen who contended for
this power on tfe part of Congress, this plain question Sup
pose this clause of the Constitution hadbten omitted, supjose
there had been nothing said about (he 'time place, and man
nei" of holding elections, would not the States have the mhe
rent power to lay off election distiicts, and send their delegates
here? What power made this Constitution? It was the peopie
of the States in their sovereign capacity assembled together
He asked, then, if die people thus assembled, g ve themselves
any powers they did not possess ber n? He admitted that the
people m convLn ion, mi^ht regulate the manner of exercising
their inherent powers, but it was absurd to suppose that, by &o
meeting, they could confer on themsel es any powers they 'd
not possess already He would further aimit, that if the terms
'time, place, and manner of holding elections," embraced % ithin
themselves the powei to district the States, it was given to Con
grcss by this clause in the Constitution, but this he denied He
might delegate power that he possessed o inothei, but 1 e could
not delegase to hirnseT power that he did not. possess He had
thusansvered the gentleman by showing that the States bad
the power and it wa«, therefore, imnecessary to delegate it to
themselves, while, if they had it rot, they could not get it in this
way
What was th" plain, common s^nse < on^i"nation of the
wmdsf, "time, place, and manner?" Tims cud not compre
1 end the power todi^tnct, it meant when 'he people *hould
copip together P ne did not mean sue' power, for it referred
to where the p^op e should come t ther, and mannei re
ferred to no'hmg "ise but as to how ' election should be held,
the mode m wh'ch the sovereign people, foi the time being,
shall transfer their pov er to their seivants, and not as to how
many of them sh uld transfer their power These terms could
not herefore embrace m them the power to district He set
¡tdown then, that Congress had no authority, under an,, state
offacts to ra^s this amendment He knew that ti e framers
of the Constitution were patriots and e ages, ard men ot good
common stnse, nnd that wherever they intended to con\ey
power they knew what kind of language it was proper to con
veyitm If, then they had intended to convey this power
they vould have used su^h plain, intelligible language as could
not be mistaken A gentleman near im said, '""at if thev did
not mean to give thi3 power to Congress by the clause m qucs
tion, what did they mean ? Mi K here gave m exp^nation
his understanding ofthe clause Aftei soi ie fuither remarks

THE GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL
On motion ot Mr EVANS, trie Senate proceeded to the con
sideration, as '- committee ofthe whole, of the bill making ap
proprlations for the civil and diplomatic expenses of the Gov
ernment for the year 1842, and the amendments of the Commit-
tee on Finance thereto
The first amendment penibng was the pioposition of the
commit eeto «tnke from the bill the foiljwiia, viz
Provided That the job printing, stationery, and binding of
each of the Executive Departments, shall, until otherwise di-
rected by law, be furnithed by contract, proposals for which
s'ia'i regularly be advertised iv the public pi mis Theclas<es,
chai acter, and description of the printing being specified m
each advertisement, as far as that can be dont, ard it being
hítele a condit on in ail ca^es, unless otherwinf specifically stated
in the advertisement, that the work chalí be done m the city of
Wa^hirgtor, and the contiact shall m each case, so far as the
í -jposa's an 1 acceptance phall enable the contract to be made,
e given to the lowest bidder whose hid shall be accompanied
with piopertest monialsof the ability o the bidder to fulfil his
contract And provided also, That no part of the sums aporo
prated foi the conm g?nt expensea o' tfee several Executive
Departments shall be applied to any other than the ordmary
expenditures of said depaitments, nor as extra allowance to any
clerk, messenger or other attendant of the said departments,
or either of th m noraspaymentorcompensation to any clerk;,
messenger, or other attendant in said departments, or eithei of
t lem, ui less the employment of such clerk, messenger, or at
terdant, be authorized by law
Mr KI\G said he could not see the propriety of striking eut
thi  proviso if he understood the matter at all the existing
law required that proposals forprmtug should be idvutieed
for It was right and proper that this c m se for executing the
printing of the departments should be adopted, inasmuch as
it would thereby he done at a much cheaper rate
Mr EVANS considered that the Senator from Alabama was
under a misapprehend n with regard to the esis ir g law re
quiring proposals One reason for bulking, out this proviso
wa>, that it was not conformable to any existing law Some
years ago, he believed, an apnropnatioi bill c< ntained a pro
vision of this sort which had its operation dunng that year;
but, the experiment being found un^a'isfactorv, it was never
aftei wards resorted to 1 he printing under that air&ngement
was ver) badly dore, and Congress did not see fit to continue it
The committee deem it improper, and propose ¡hat the proviso
shall be stricken out He believed the whole cost of printing m
the State Depaument, independently of tke publishing of the
Uwe would not amount to more than $800 and there was no
«reatdangerthatthemoneywouldhemisapplied When propo
*als were allowed it was found that they were inva.iably put m
ata low rate, by persons who were incapab'e of doing the work
feomebody else had, at last, to be called m to do the work, and
it cost more than it would otherwise have done As to thesec
ond proveo it would prevent the employment of additional
c erke, whose servicPK wererenuered necessary by the calling
uionthedtpaitmems for information, as Corgi e«s was per
petualiv doing
Mr KING had no objection that the vote should be taken
separately upon the two provisoes The explanation of the
honorable Senator certainly (lace'' the matter m a ddPient
ligh m his mind He had been under the impreehion that the
liwiequnng pioposal- was a permanent ore
>I¡ EVANS remained that a bill would bp shortly r ported
n the Senate toiegulate the printing hereafter m a d fferent
manner, and it would be much better o dwai the passage of
that hill and, m the mean time, allow the woik to be Jone m
the usual way
Mr KING replied that he considered it very uncertain that
«uch a bill would become a 1"W He leierred to the Senator
from New Hampshire [Mr Woodbury ] who in the discharge
of his official duties as head of the treasury Department, had
acted upon the supposition that the law he had refened ti
was a permanent one   K it waanot considered a permaaen*
