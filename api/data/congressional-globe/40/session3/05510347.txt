1869.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
847-
the Osage, Cherokee, and other lands. It in-
volves the proper equalization of the burdens
of State and local taxation. It involves the
prosperity, presentand prospective, of the com-
mon schools of my State, it is of vast import-
ance even to the Territories west of Kansas.
It is essential to the proper relations of the
coordinate branches of the Government, of the
right exercise of the functions that belong to
each, and it may even affect the territorial
integrity of the Union itself. This abuse of
the treaty power once granted, and allowed to
grow unchecked into precedent, may be but the
stepping-stone to more dangerous assumptions.
Sir, the Republican party of the State of Kan-
sas has expressed itself in an unmistakable man-
ner as to the policy it sustains upon this ques-
tion. At its last State convention the following
was adopted almost unanimously:
" 5. In the distribution of public lands and Indian
reserves we demand the full protection ot the rights
of settlers, and the reservation of the sixteenth and
thirty-sixth sections to which the State is entitled for
educational purposes. Wholesale grants of territory
to speculation and foreign corporations are unfavor-
able to the interests of the community, and incon-
sistent with tho obj ects for which the national domain
should be distributed. We especially condemn the
policy of the disposing of Indian reservations to rail-
roads or land monopolies, and insist that such lands
be undeniably opened to actual settlement at not
more than 81 25 per acre. We demand, in the name
of our frontier settlers, that the uncivilized Indians
be driven from the State, and the civilized tribes be
speedily removed to the Indian country."
The same convention did me the honor, in
the face of a determined opposition made on
account of the position 1 had taken in this
House on the Osage treaty, and similar mat-
ters, to renominate me by a large majority. I
went before my constituents on the issues raised
by the Republican party, both in nation and
State, and after canvassing the State,speaking at
length and frequently on this question, among
others, was reelected by a majority of over six-
teen thousand in a vote of over forty-five thou-
sand. It is my intention, therefore, as it is my
duty, to be true to the trust which the people
of Kansas have confided to my hands, as their
only representative upon this floor, and espe-
cially to be faithful lotheprinciplesandpurposes
of the great party of freedom with which all
the days of my political life have been associ-
ated ; and, sir, one of the most cherished and
cardinal of those principles is that of free
homesteadsâ€”the preservation of the public
domain for the occupation of the bona fide
settler.
It shall be my purpose hereafter to resist
every encroachment upon that principle. I
shall continue to oppose that abuse of the treaty
power which this Househas already condemned,
but which has not yet received its death-blow.
It will be my purpose to vote hereafter in favor
of only sueli measures as will increase the
security and value of the homestead system.
I' shall oppose the direct granting of more
lands to railroad schemes without conditions
being previously annexed allowing settlement
and purchase by the pioneer farmer at stated
prices. I shall vote for all measures which
make railroads already in possession of land
subsidies throw open the same at the same
rates and rules as this House has already indi-
cated shall be required whenever any more
land grants are bestowed.
In short, Mr. Chairman, whatever measures
maybe necessary to maintain the homestead
policy unbroken and to keep the great bulk of
the public domain aslhe Republic's best inter-
ests demand, for the occupation of the toiling
and landless millions, will receive my most
cordial support, as 1 am sure they will that of
the people of Kansas.

The PRESIDENT pro tempore presented

zens of the United States, praying that the
right of suffrage be extended to women in the
District of Columbia and the Territories: which
was referred to the Committee oil tho District
of Columbia.
He also presented the petition of Edwin
Booth and others, citizens of the United
States, praying that the right of suffrage bo

bia and the Territories ; which was referred to
the Committee on the District of Columbia.

New Jersey, praying that the right of suffrage

Mr. CONKLING presented a memorial of

merce.
Mr. WILSON presented a petition of citi-
zens of the United States, praying that the
right of suffrage be extended to women in the
District of Columbia and in the Territories;

Mr. HARLAN. I present the memorial of a
convention held at Prairie Du Chien, W iscon-
sin, November 10, 18G8, by their committee,
Samuel Merrill, Governor of Iowa, B. J. Ste-
vens, of Wisconsin, M. J. Gilchrist, of Iowa,
and William J. LaDuc, of Minnesota, praying
for an appropriation for the improvement of
the Wisconsin and Fox rivers, with a view of
securing water communication between the
Mississippi river and tho lakes. This is a very
able document, setting forth the advantages
that would result from the establishment of
such a line forming a communication between
the grain and food-producing States and the
other parts of the Union. Perhaps I ought to
state that this contemplated work has been
surveyed by a board of engineers appointed by
the Secretary of War, General Warren being
the chief of the board. They ascertained that
this improvement can be made by an appro-
priation of less than five hundred thousand
dollars, so as to secure a channel three feet
deep throughout the entire length, or four feet
in depth by an appropriation ot $3,000,000, or
five feet in depth by an appropriation of
$4,000,000. The memorialists, by the com-
mittee, submit also with this memorial a memo-
randum suggesting an appropriation in the
nature of a loan with a regulation requiring
tolls to be paid, and the interest on this loan
to be paid out of tho tolls, and ultimately the
principal. I move that the memorial be re-
ferred to the Committee on Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. WILLEY presented the petition of
Alplieus C. Gallahue, praying an extension or
his patent for an improvement _in machines tor
pegging boots and shoes; which was referred
