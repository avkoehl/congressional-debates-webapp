the revenue would be increased by raising the duties The ta
i iff would not do it Gentlemen had said, take back the public
lands. He believed this would in a great measure tend to the
restoiationoflhe credit of Government, although it would not
give sudden andimmediate relief They had to suit themselves
to the want of expansion of the currency, a want of disposition
to use imponed articles, and to the falling off of the proceeds of
the public lands
What was the remedy which he> would recommend he had
been asked He wouUMell 1 he State oí JSew York had come
up to direct taxation, and its credit was better in Wall street
than that of any other State, and he prophesied that, befoie
, ninety days, the stocks of that State would be at par Here
ferred to these things to show—and he srorve only for him&eif—
that we could get through these difficulties, and come out with
flying colors Could we get the money by this loan abroad?
He had been credibly informed that while me stocks of Spain,
which he believed had not paid any interest for twenty yean,
were selling in market m London, ours would not seil at all
Was there any piobability that we could get par foi the United
Mates stocks, when Ohio stocks were sola for fifty cents, and
New York city stocks at ninety seven or ninety eight
In addition*to this was the alarming condition of our foreign
affairs He was no believer in Lout Ashbaiton's mission, it
would end in nothing
It was nece«ary to approach the pri sent state of affairs m a
spirit of patriotism He looked on the present bill as one which
would check the march of libeial principle*. Every cent they
added to the burden of the people of the coi  (ry was a check on
liberal principles
Mr SMITH of Virginia, said he felt a particular desire in
consequence of allegations made by femUmen on the floor of
the deep indebtedness of this Goveinmer at the commence
mentof the present Administration, to ret arto the facts, and,
by reference to the reports of the lat< an i piesent Secretary
of the Treasury, Mr Fwmg and Mr Forwar \ proceeded to «how
the amount of debt left by the Ada íauíration of Mr Van
Buren, by means of companng the ag^re ate expenditure of
Government duung that Administration v th ihe income for
the time The former the report showejto be 0115,614 080,
and the latter $110,737,000, showing an amount of indebted
nese left by that Administration oí ibout $4,877,000, and this
he considered a mode of computaticn that could not bedis
pvjted
He then adverted to the charge made by ihe gentleman from
North Carolina [Mr Stanly) that ti appropnations during
Mr Van Buren's Administration haletct-sded the estimates,
aadproceeded to aigue at some length, b/refeience todocu
melts, the falsity of this charge He also leferreü to Mr
Ewmg'e report, and to the report made to the Senate this ses
sion from the Treasury Department, to show the amount of
public debt at the commencement of this  Admmistiation, fiom
all which he concluded that that amount wa« but little more
than four millions
* He then at some length, examined the mannei of conducting
the finances adopted by the pie^ent Adrnims ration char§
wg the Wins paity with abanlonment of their principles,
dibregard of then piofessions of economy, and, while the i eve
Xiue was constantly deci easing, with an increase of expendí

Mr 1LA\ pitsented a petition from Sandnskv, Ohio, ie
mons rating against the repeal oí the bankrup  law
Mr  CLAY said he was also charged with the pie^entation
of a petition upon the subjec of international copyright    The
petition was signed by a large number of distinguished indivi
duals, authors, literary men, professors m colleges, in the city
ofNewYo^t.atthe head of which stands the name of Wash
ington Irving, our present Minister to Spam    The petitioners
represented that American genius was crippled, and  labored
under ffieat difficulties for the want of the pausase of such a
law as they prayed for    He believed that the names appended
to this petition, together with tho*¡e which had been here
tofoie   presented   upon   the   subject,   embraced  the   whole
of   the   literary   men   of  eminence   m   the   Hiion      He
had, on a  lormex occasion,    presented   a   papei—he did
not know that it could be called a pen ion—signed by the mo t
illustrious menofgemu=! and learning m Great Butam, hav
ing the same object m view, namely the piocunne of an irter
national, copyright law   They perceived, then, thei e was a con
currence between ourown countrymen and the sublets of other
nations upon the subjec   They held equally the opinion that a
law of this kind would be one of gieat utility   And he i egi ettcd
extremely   that  pnoi   to his   íetnement  fiom the Senate,
which   would  take   place   to moirow    this   matter about
which   he had  felt a deep solicitude could  not have hetn
definitely    settled      Ihe   bill  which   he   had   the   honor
to offer some yeais ago, and which he had íenewed almost an
nuahy, was extremely limited in its oh¡ect    it mfnnsred no
mans nshtto publish and sell any of thewoiks already ex
tant, it left them liee to bJ u--ed as pub i&hers pleased, but it
was simply provided lhat future productions should be pro
tected,   and in alt cases wheie foreigners  were allowed to
avail themselves of the copy light law so far from inflicting
an mjuiy upon the literary opeiations of thi«countiy,the book
binders,   the   punters   the   paper   makers,  it   was    pro
vuled that when a  patent was «ecured the work ^houll
be  published    m   this   countiy     It was   the   opinion  of "11
intelligent portions with whom he had conversed upon the sub
ject,that the passage of-such alaw was necessary for the en
courasement of Americangeniut, and talent  theie wis nodif
ferenee of opinion upon the subject    H*1 knew perfectly the
sources from which the opposition to the passage of the law
arose  It arose chiefly from two great book establ shments, one
m New Yors, and the other in Philadelphia   These large esta
bhshments, by means of their capital and then agencie , were
enabled to publish the woiks which appealed in England
and   France,  and  place   them   before   Amenean    leaders
with  much  less expense   to themselves than   they   could
da if such alaw existed, but this very facility of «e zing upon
and appropriating the productions of other countries,  made
them treat with the-greater indifference the pioduction of Ame
rican authors    When American authors piesent their writings
in the expectation of receiving a fair pi ice for *hem,  he reply
they received was, why should we give you any thing, when
we can get foreign works much moieatfraemethan yours, (for
the very reason, perhaps, that they arefoieign ) without pa>ing
foi them    These establishments have prevailed  upon other
individuals   to   represent   that an    intmy "woul 1 accrue to
them from the passage of sucha iaw    From t^ese souice*, it
wa™, tlias this seiniH opposition had arwi     Sir il this be a
coi rect statement of the fact, as he believed it to be, he noped it
would have but little effect m íebtrainingthe action ofCoi «ress

mcorj orated mthis partofoui system, might with equal yio
