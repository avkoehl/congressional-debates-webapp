to have the same expunged fromtl e Journal of the
Senate
Mr KI2vG moved that the resolutions be laid
on the tajle and printed
Tt e re clution^ having been read,
Mr CLAY suid, bdore any order shoald be
taken for Iiymg the resolutions on tne tab'e which
1 ad been addre  ed to t le Senatorsfrom Alaban a
as ii s rixtioi s, he wou J be glad to know it it was
the purpos" of the gentleman who had presented
them to submit a proposition toeA¡ urge the íeso-
lution alluded to from the Journal of the Senate>
Mr K!>,G, of Alabama, being aboutto speak,
ga\ e way to
Mr BENTON, who rose and sad that the
Senate would recollect that w he" the resolution of
censure was adopted, he gave ímmedia.e notice
to the Senate and to the Ame-ican peop'e that he
would commence a series of motions foi the pur
po«e of haung the offensive resolution expunged
from ti e Journal He used the word expunge in
ointradi unction to the words repeal or reverse,
because he believed at that time—and experience
had confirmed him m the belief—that a reperl of
it wou'1 not do justice iO ihe case It lequired
an expurgation of the Journal itself, which should
opir te as a declaratioi to all future times, that it
s lould not have been theie lie «rave this notice
fiom a conviction arisu g Irom ti e deepest reflec
tío i thtttne Senate, in udopting that resolution,
were tiamj line undci foot the Constitu ion Oi the
Uni ed Stito, and no* only ¡>c>, but all the forms
of administering cnminal justice He gave the
no ne, tio, wi h ut i msul ation w to any human
1 e n_, i ml i ot a I em * on this e-uth could eiy that
hea ke 1 hmi whether it was right or wrong- He
lad lot dole so, nor ne\er would he consult with
any one upon such an occasion No man con
feire 1 moie wi'h his friends on ordinary occasions
than he di 1 but there were some occasions and
emerjeic es on wl ich he consulted with none
And on this subject he calcuhted no consequences,
he cunsideied it immaterial if (lie whole Senate
should get up as one mai , and vote against it So
strong were his conditions of the pro riety of
Ml n it i g it, tint he would pic-ent it at tne haz
aid of ail consequences
The presentation of the Alabama resolutions
afforded him an opportunity of giving th.s public
notice, which he had often given privately here
He had told honorable members thaf he should,
at a convenient time, move this resolution On
yesterday evening when he saw an attemDt made
to give to the report of the Committee upon the
General Post Office, such a course and destination
as was to eventuate m a legislative measure here,
and when an attempt was made by the two Sena-
tors from South Carolina, to have this measure
followed up by something eUe, which was to be
a proceeding upon persons in contradistinction to
the subject-matter of the report, and m reality was
an impeachment in ti e form of legisla'ion, he then
determined to give notice, that at a convenient
time, he would offer a resolut on to expunge the
resolution of censure from the Journal This was
an answer to the inquiry
Mr KING, ot Alabama, said that he thought it
was so weil understood that the gen l >man from
Missouri had it in contemplation to offer the reso-
lution he had just s, oken of, thit he was sur
prised when the gentleman fiom Kentucky asked
him whether he was disposed to offer it He
could only say, toat havirf vot d against the reso-
lution of censure, he had supposed that his opm
ions on the subject bo'h then and sinne were well
understood 1 he Legislature of Alabama had
ms ructed him to do that which wou'd have made
it his duty to have brought such a reso ution before
the Senate, if the gentleman from Missouri had
dechned doing so He would in tn:tt event have
introduced it, embracing as we 1 'hat subject as
the right of instri etior He he d that right m
its fullest extent For he held it, not impugning
the omnions of others who thought differently
Cuf viewing that right as he did h* should ftel
himself bound to carry the wishes of his constitu
ents into effect when fairly aad fully made known
His course with regard to the resoution com
plam°d of, was well known, and, therefore, the
instructions from the Legislature of Alabama
scarcely applied to him If the moveme-t depended
upon him, he should have been disposed to have
suffered it to sleep where it was, if tne subject had
not been urged upon him But, if it was not
brought forward, he s1 ould feel himself bound to
bring it forward, and when thatshou d be done he
would of course vote for it If there were prece-
dents for it, as he bel eved theie we e, he should
vote for expungmg the objectionable resolution
from the Journal He might hesitate as to the
mode of doing it, but he would do everything to
effe"t it in fact
Mr CLAY said that the gentleman from Ala-
Lama presented these instructions from theLegis-
lature of Alabama, unaccompanied by any motion
to submit a reso'u'ion to expunge in accordance
with the institutions, and he (\li C ) felt quite
surpnsed that the gentleman snould not have ex
pee'ed the inquiry which he had made The in-
quiry was addressed to that gentleman, and him
only As to the answer which had been given by
another Senator, it was known that h s íelations
wi'h him were not of such a character as would
enable him to know his purposes But he hoped
these resolutions would be witndrawn for the pres-
ent, and a'cer the honoiable gentleman had made
a careful exammatio i of the Consai ition of the
United States upon the subject of each House
keeping & lecord of its proceedings, if he then
thought proper to present them \  th the resolu-
tion proposed, he could do so Tor himself, l.e
should think it his duty to his God and to his
countiy to oppose such a proposition at the very
threshold He submitted to the g"nt!eman the
propriety of witndraw a g the resolutions for the
piesent
Mi MOORE said, he hnd not anticipated any
discussion would arise upon ihe presentation of
the lesolutionsfiom theGeneril assembly of Ala-
bama, but as it had so u íexpectedly occuiied, he
wo lid be? lesve to say a vvoid oi two only
Sir, (said Mr M ,) his colleague might have sav-
ed himself the trouble of mfoiming the Senate that
these resolutions were not intended to influence
his conduct on the si l,ect of the expunging reso
lution, his will n'sness to \o e .n con ormuy with
the instructions would not Le doubted here or
eseuheie Mi M said he was free to edmit that
he m all probability was entitled to the honor of
having given rise to the resolutions, because, he
said, he had, in the exercise of his honest convic-
tions of propriety, on some few occasions been
compelled to vote differently from his colleague,
and poss'bly on the question referred to by the
resolutions, he entertained, however, the same
views row that he entertained then
Mr M said, as regarded the right of instruc-
tion, he admitted it to the fullest extent ever
claimed, as practised upon by the republican party
since the establishment of the Government, that
right, however, abided with the people as the
source of all power The sovereign people, he
said, had the legitimate right, either by themselves
or their agents, at their own instance, to instruct
their Senators upon matters of policy connected
witn theinnterest, these agents,however, as they
were only public servants themselves, must also
act in pursuance of the will of the sovereign
people
As regarded any matter involving constitutional
questions, Mr M felt himself bound by higher
and paramount obligations to his conscience But
upon all questions of policy he would be found
acknowledging the right of instruction by the
people, and the corresponding obligation on the
public servant to obey
Mr KING expressed his unwillingness to pro-
voke a discusslion, or to go further than to move
to lay the resou'ions on the table this he would
do He could not accede to the pioposition of
the gentleman from Kentucky to withdraw them.
When he should feel it his duty to call them up,
he would introduce such a resolution as he thought
proper And when he thought fit, he would bring
the subject forward,and the honorable gentleman
would have an oppo-tumty of discharging his duty
to his county and his God by opposing it
Mr MOORE said the resolution did not require
either him or his colleague to bring forward a
resolution to expunge They seemed to contem-
pla'e that such a resolution would be brought
forward But he submitted to his honorable col-
league, whether he would not consider it his duty
to introduce a íesolution
Mr CLAY asked whether it was not better
to withdraw the resolutions and offer them to-
morrow
Mr PRESTON said that the honorablegentle-
man from Missouri made reference to the debate
of yesterday, and stated that on account of the
remarks of the Senators from South Carolina, he
felt it to be his dutv, earlier than he intended, to
submit his resolution Not having investigated
his motives, he was surprised at the connection
which was made by him between the two subjects.
Last night he (Mr P ) stated that, upon the report
of the honoiable chairman, [Mr Grundy,] there
could be but one opinion,and herefore that some
expression of the Senate should be made upon
toe sub,ect matte- of it, and the honorable gentle-
man supposed that, as he (Mr P ) was not con-
tent with piospecti/e legislation, that he required
that some course should be pursued upon the
persons implicated in the department, and that,
therefore, the gentleman intended to introduce his
resolution Was it thought that, because he
chose to censure the Post Office Department, a
measure should be introduced here to censure the
Senate of the United States' Admit the Senate
had done wrong, upon what principle would you
introduce a censure of tne Senate here? Were
his lips to be closed, as a Senator of the United
States, in pronouncing censure upon a notoriously
conupt and irsohent department because tho
Senate itself was not free from blame before the
people5 The gentleman was m staken, too, in
supposing that he intended to censure persons
From the bottom of his heart he hoped that the
head of the department was free from blame.
And, as the honorable chairman of the committee
himself thought that only malfeasance existed
there, he would say, neither that gentleman, nor
the gentleman from Missoun, had failed to vots
at the last session for just such a resolution as he
pioposed
[Here Mr P read the resolution passed last
session, declaung the borrowing of money by tne
Post Off.ce Department to be unconstitutional,
and the veas and nays upon its passage ]
Mi P resumed The very fust name upon
the list (he said) was that of  he honorable mem-
