Major-General HOKE,

Commanding, &amp;c., Sugar Loaf:

GENERAL It is reported that the soldiers at your division infirmary near this place are committing numerous depredations and deserting to an alarming extent. In view of these facts, and of the limited facilities there for the treatment of men really sick, the commanding general desires your opinion upon the expediency of breaking up the infirmary and sending all men too sick to stay in camp to the hospitals in Wilmington.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Sores necessary for our subsistence are reported to have been wasted and destroyed. The commanding general directs guards to be furnished to protect property, and, if necessary, every officer and man in the command shall be kept under arms at all times until discipline can be enforced.
