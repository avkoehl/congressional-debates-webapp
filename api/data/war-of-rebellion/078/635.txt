HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, FORREST'S CAVALRY,Montevallo, Ala., June 3, 1864.

Brigadier General G. J. PILLOW,

Talladega, Ala.:

GENERAL: I send you a dispatch from General Lee directed to you or myself, which I have read. * You will see that General Lee wishes any DIVISION to be here and ready to move at a moment's notice. I presume that MISSISSIPPI is threatened, and the removal of General Forrest makes the presence of my command there necessary. I hope you will send the order to Colonel Neely to return at once, so that he will not travel farther than necessary; he is to-night at Munford.

I am, general, &amp;c., your obedient servant,

JAS. R. CHALMERS,

Brigadier-General.
