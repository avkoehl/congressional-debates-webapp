We marched to Ripley, Miss., without any occurrence worthy of mention, except the loss of two men between Germantown and Collierville on March 4. These men belonged to Company C, Twelfth Illinois Cavalry, and, with another man from the same company, were, in violation of orders, foraging for corn in a barn, where they were captured by a few rebels. One of them escaped and reached Memphis in disguise, reporting that he saw the other two murdered. At Ripley Lieutenant-Colonel McQueen, with 100 men from the First Iowa Cavalry, was sent to the Tallahatchie, on the Cotton Plant road, where he remained till the division moved on the 9th instant. On the 8th a party of the Twelfth Illinois, under Lieutenant Pratt, swam the Tallahatchie and drove a party of twenty-five or thirty rebels out of New Albany without loss. The brigade marched with the division on the 9th, was detached on the 11th by the Marshall Institute road, and reached Memphis without accident on the evening of the same day at 11 p. m. The losses of the brigade are as follows, viz:
