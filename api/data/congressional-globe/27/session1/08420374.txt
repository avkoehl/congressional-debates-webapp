But New Hampshire was not th* only State, in those halcyon
days of party ob ¿vion, to declare her opinion that the Bank
waa constitutional On the 11th of December, 1821, a special
committee of the Legislature of South Carolina, to whom was
referred a resolution of the Legislature of Pennsylvania pro
pjsmg an amendment to the Constitution of the United States
tiat '"Congressshould make no laws to erect or incorporate a
Bank or other moneyed institution except within the District of
Columbia," reporten a resolution declining he concurrence of
the Legislature of South Carolina m the proposed amendment
The preamble contained these words
"Your committee are unanimously of opinion that, as Con*
gxess is constitutionally invested wi h the right to mcorpoiatea

witpinsuch narrow limits as the District of Columbia They
apprehend no danger from the exercise of the powers which
the people ofthe United States have confided to Congress but
believe that, in theexer ise of these powers that body will ren

the fatigue of listening to me    I have ende ivorei to  prove
tiat the power of Congiess to establish a National Bank has

honorable gentleman to post himself on the ground that this is
a public, not a private corporation, that, being a mere Fiscal
Agent of the Government, appointed fur the subservience of its
own purposps, Congress possesses no power to render the
grant inalienable, but may withdiiw and resume at its plea
sure, withoutany violation of the plighted faith ofthe nation,
oi aty infringement of vested or puvatc rights Then, eir, 1
will not appeal to the opinions of the dead, but of the Iivm*,
and I referthe Senator to an authority higher, it may be, m his
emulation, than t ven that of the late Chiei Justice—I mean the
present Chief Justicce of the Supreme Court Jn a celebrated
report, communicated by Mr Taney, from the Treasury De-
pwmentto Congress, on the3d December, 1833,1 readthis lan-
guage
"In pursuance ofthe power reserved to Ihe Secretary ofthe
Treasury, by the act of Congress entitled 'An act to me rporate
the subscribers to the Bank of the United States' I have direct
ed that the dep >sites of the money of the United States shall not
be made in said Bank or branches thereof, but is certain State
barks which have been designated for that purpose, and I now
proceed to lay befuie Congress the ieason& which induced me
to give this oider and direction "
lie then quotes the sixteenth section of the chattel, from
which the power of removal was derived, and proceeds
"It has bf>en settled by repealed adjudication, that a chapter
eran ted by a State to a coi poiation, iikt that of the B-wk of the
United States, is a contract between the sovereignty which
grants u and the stockholders The same pin ciple must apply
to a charter granted by the United feratei an 1 consequently,
the act incorporating the Bank is to be regirde 1 as a contract
between the U need Sates °f theouepait and thestockholdeis

is notan open question, and I leave him toielieve himself fiom

A few weds sir on this subject to the Senator from South
Caiolina (Mi Calhoun") In the face of hii, position in 1S16—
in the face of <h p< moa of South Cdtulinain 1821—he has de

the inviolability ofthe national faith than that honorable gentle
man In the di«cu--sion which aro«e in this House in 1833 upon
the removal ofthe dt polities, he concurred with Mr Taney that
thcchnteioi the B-snk was a contract between the Govern
tnent and the stockholder  "The Secietary Miesnd 'asseits
and aft-j-ertc iroly, that the Bank charter is a contract between
the Government, or lather the people of the United States, and
the Bank," and, having argued upon that postulate, ne wound
up the argument as allows
* I have now offered all the rcmaiksl intended in inference
to the deposite question, and, on reviewing the whole ground, I
must say that the Secretary in removing the deposit ^ has
clearly transcended his power that he ha=: violated the contiact

PUBLICITY OF BANK ACCOUNTS
REMARKS OF MR. HENDERSON,
or Mississippi,
Upon his motion to amend th? Bank bill, extending to the
several sf ockholdtrs the ight of investigation, ¡§-c
Mr President I propose a lurther an endment to this bill,
go as to exttnd an unlimited right oi examination into the
affairs and conduct oí the Bank, by a y one or mo e of toe
stockholders of the institution To this amendment my jud¿
ment and purpose have been maturely pledged, nordolgoas
far as my delibera e convictiors would urge me, because liank
to cou'e-as I should despair oí convincing any considerable
pomof of this Senate of the soundness of my views upon this
subject It is not to be expected we shou Id suddenly chanee a
long cherished opinion, however erroneous Precipitancy is
an error, ev^n when it=* impulses are rightly directed But hav
mg made up my own opinion upon this pnuciple, without haete
or prejudice, and upon careful observation, I had determined to
present it to the consideration of the Senate, though I should be
found voting alone in its favor And it ma/ be an indiscretion,
to confess, farther, that if governed solely by my own opinion
that instead of the amendment offered Ishould probably have
proposed that the Bank and its branches should, on each suc-
ceeding day of its discounts, prepare, in authentic form, and
exhibit, in someway to public inspection, its exchangee and
discounts of the preceding day, with all the pai ieb' names con
nected with each t=eparaie transaction
I well know, Mr President, ihi« opinion will be assailed by
thnse true and hackneyed arguments which the advocates jf
secrecy m usapr Hcation to the banking eystem, are accus
tomed to interpose Secrecyt m secular, as in religious mat
teis has ever possessed a potent charm at playing ofF\ ilgur
credulity against humn rea on and common senbe
But let us restrain our preconceived opinions a moment to
inquire what the evil this amendment contemplates, and what
jtsfitre s to redress if The evil, in brief, is nial admistration
We all know this, which is known to every body The proof
has astounded us times ov«r and ove¡ a^ain If is the evil of
all evils to which the banking system is exposed, and ¡s work
in"- its destruction moie suiely than all other ev is put to
gt her Doubtless much injury is incurred to the £><! em from
n xperience mic]udgment, and incompetency m its govern-
ment But th u which lesulta mobt frequently m deceiving the
stockholders and entrancing the depositor—which the public
most deprecate, and from wh.ch the system has most to fear,
is wilful misapplication of the capital, clique influences,
and partiality and favoritism, in administering the accommoda
t onsof the Bank
Ihe history oi our banking system, paiDcularly the insolvent
banks, is but an amplification of this charge 1 could exhaust
the day in detailing instances of this humiliating and diepa
raeing truth It is known to be in reference to their possible
abuses the visitonal power is inserted in all ourbank charters
It is acknowledged hei e, that, in view of the increasing magm
tude of these ascert" ned abuses, ihe committee have enlarged
the vi norial power in the present charter Qhey have done
well so fai ai they have gone They have declared the power
aright but, in my opinion, thev have not permitted an appli
cation and assertion of the power to an extent commensurate
with its conservative policy, and the increasing evil it proposes
to redres
I consider it then, as admitted by the friends of tins bill, that
the abuses alluded to prevail, and aie increasing, and that
greater publicity than heretofore is necessary to check its on-
ward march, and, accoichrgly this bill, m assertion of the
power, has shielded nothing ofthe aflU rs ofthe Bank from its
researches or from public exposi ion But the bill proposes
an execution of the power, onlv, by a committee of the stock
holdets, a committee of Congiess,, or by the Secretary of the
Ureasmy    My purpose is to extend it to eachstockholdei
Expeuer^e and observation have satisfied me that appoint
ments similar to those to whom the naht of investigation is
committed by the bill, are too reluctant and inert in getungmto
action, and tío credulous and confiding, or too indifferent in
their researches when inaction to jender them sufficiently ef*
fectivp to accomplish the objects desired Hence, by this
amendment I would employ all the watchful instincts of self-
interest—invoke the vigilance ofthe partners and principal? in
th° concern—and confide less to the lethergic action of majori-
ties or the very measuied z al oftnetuWees
And whence the alarm m all this, and what the objection
that those directly concerned in favoi of a faithful administra
tion, shmild be permitted to look into the management of their
own fundb? Is it not moialiy rigH that stockholders should
have this privilege, and in wl at re&pect is it politically wrong?
I do not prptpnd howevei to pre'*; this amendment, merely to
secure tuc stockholder^ Bui I am tne better satisfied that if
promotes the private dght, in harmony with the publ c interest
Foi whatevei subse t5? to piotect the one, re-ults in a corres
pondent security to the other Ard our right to do what duty
thus do jbly demands is u o ohvit us foi conn oversy
1 believe then, much good may be hoped ft r from this
amendment There is no stronger incentive to evil, then as
surance of escapm? detection A^euied even of temporary
concealment, man will h?zird much with the present, and trust
laigely to the future The amendment holds up the admoni
tion, if a probable sudden «un prise, upon the cjrrent conduct
of those in government of the Bank It threatens ihe disco\e
ry of wrong in the actof transgiession It holds up to the vi
sion of the actors the open forum of public opinion    And Uc
