to be so perfect in all its parts, that its friends op-
pose every amendment, however wise and merit-
orious. Up to the present hour, 1 suppose not
less than fifty propositions have been offered and
voted down, in this bill, the Ohio and Arkansas
are provided for. Why is the Tennessee left out?
It was m the bill reported by a similar committee
to the last Congress. Has it grown less import-
ant, or less national and meritorious?
This improvement has been estimated for by
the Department. Several members of that com-
mittee have informed me that they are willing to
put this amendment in. The gentleman from
Maryland [Mr. Walsh] intimated his w...ing-
ness for its incorporation into the bill. I hope he
will now yield it his support, and I trust that it
will meet with the approval of a majority of this
committee.
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman must con-
fine his remarks to an explanation of his amend-
ment.
Mr. CHURCH WELL. My amendment ex-
plains itself. [Laughter.] Its reading is its best
explanation, and I hope it will be passed. I will
tell gentlemen interested in the passage of this bill
that eleven votes will count in its passage. I ask
the adoption of my amendment, because I believe
it to be necessary and proper. If we look back
into the history of this system, we find that the
Tennessee river, although the fourth river m nav-
igable extent in the United States, has received
comparatively nothing from the Treasury.
Mr. WALSH. The gentleman must have been
mistaken in supposing I would vote for this amend-
ment. Lie told me there had been .surveys made
for the improvement of the Tennessee river by
the General Government, and that he had them
in his possession. I told him that I would look
.it them wi^h pleasure, f gave him no assurance
that I would vote for the appropriation.
Mr. CHURCHWELL. The gentleman said
that he had no objection to the improvement of
the Tennessee river, and I understood him to sav
the amendment ought to be adopted.
Mr WALSH. F said on yesterday that the
time would speedily come when the Tennessee
river would be reached tn the progress of these
improvements.
Mr. CHURCH WELL. Yes, sir, the time
will come, I hope—and 1 suppose the gentleman
would vote that it i e unproved now if it cost noth-
ing. The honorable gentleman remarked that he
had not ueen the estimates. Those estimates were
before the committee. They were in the hands of
its chairman for several days, and if the gentleman
fromMaryland has nor seen them it is not my fault,
lhaielhem. He can see them now. It will be
my pleasure to show them to him. Here they

Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I would ask my
colleague whether by his remark, that eleven votes
would pass a bill, he alluded to the delegation from
Ten nessee*
Mr. CHURCHWELL. Jn reply to the hon-
orable gentleman, I will state that an explanation
is unnecessary. Everybody knows how you will
vote.
Mr. JONES. There are eleven from Tennes-
see.
Mr. CHURCHWELL. Yes, sir; but I did
not say eleven votes from Tennessee; there are
some from Kentucky who I hope will support my
amendment, and who will not support the bill
unless there is more liberality shown to western
rivers. I should like to make an allusion to the
history of this question, ns it seems that from the
position I have assumed,! am to be indirectly
lectured by my own colleague. I beg leave to
present to the consideration of the committee a
| test vote m the United States Senate, where, it is
' to be presumed, are the leaders of the parties, that
i it may be seen that 1 am not alone in that posi-
i tion.
: In the Congressional Globe of March 3, 1847,
j among1 the proceedings of that date I find the fol-
! lowing test vote:
, "Mi Davis moved that the Senate proceed to consider
1 the bill making appropnatious for the improvement of cer-
i tain iiveii  and harbors.
! "Mr. J). explained that it was a bill from the House ap-
! piopriatmj; about $600,' 00 foi the improvement of livers in
] the West, and forceitam haibors.
I (,Mr Uauoy undcistood the objocl of the hill. Blithe
' hoped it would not be taken up. a* it would lead to a dis-
i eu*-aon which would consume so much time as would pie-
i judice othei bill* oi uraafer impottancc.
■ * " Mr. Da\ is replied, that whether there \va* any dis-ous-
1 moii would depend on the Senator tiom Alabama and his
, Ineiid.s. lie (Mi. D.) did not intend to discuss* it.
•• Mi. Haoby said he would oppo-c the hill item bv item.
"Mi Di\ stated that he had introduced this bill. lie had
no doubt of the constitutionality or the appropriations foi
the objects which weio spccitu'd. and lie hoped the bill
would be i>a.-M'd.
" The ea* and nav> were oidei ed en the motion to lake
up the bill, and the question henitr taken, it \va*decided as

end eighteen "Whigs, and only six Democrats
against it.
' The CHATflMAN. The Chair is sorry to in-
teirupt t:i" gentleman, but he must confine his
■ remarks to his amendment.
Mr. OF-IUUCH WELL. 1 hope the amend-
ment will pass. My time will not allow me to
enter into a constitutional anrumentupon th:s sub-
ject, but i content myself by giving the opinion
"(as inferred from their votes) of Twenty Demo-
, crats, strict constructionists, of the Senate, who
voted in favor of the system on a test question—
onlv six voting against it. I am opposed to a
general aud extravagant system of internal im-
provement; hut having the sanction of Mr. Jeffer-
son, Mr. Modison, Mr. Monroe, and General
Jackson, under whose administrations appiopri-
otions were made, ) thought proper to ask an ap-
propriation for an object as national and as im-
' portant as any in ihe bill. 1 hope it will be
! granted. During a period of forty years in the
history of the Administrations, from ]80G up to
; 1845, there has been expended for road, harbor,
and river improvements, not including surveys,
f $17,199,228. I propose to give the amount ex-
pended by each Administration, the year of the
expenditure, the State in which expended, and
the division of the Union in which expended.
The information is exhibited in the following ta-
bles, viz:
Expenditure op each Administration.
Under Mr. Jefferson  $48,400
" Mr. Madison  250,000
" Mr. Momoe  706,621
" Mr. J. a. Adams  2,310,475
u General Jackson 10,582,882
" Mr. Van Buren  2,222,544
« Mr. Tyler  1,076,500
$17,199,223
in a period of forty years, making an average
expenditure little short of $430,000 the year.
