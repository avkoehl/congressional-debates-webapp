upon to move from this place and Lebanon on the rebels. Confess I do not understand him, and his dispatch has something of the appearance of a stampede. I will direct the infantry to bring back whatever spoils Kennett may have collected at Harsville, as soon as we can get wagons to haul them here.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Nashville, November 14, 1862.

Major-General THOMAS:

I wish you would select the best locality in your neighborhood for covering that angle of the railroad by a regiment-the headquarters to be a substantial little field-work, well located for defense, wood, and water; detachments from the regiments on the railroad placed in blockhouses. If public service would be benefitted thereby, blot out Gallatin, or dispose of the recesh inhabitants in any way you think consistent with justice and public interests. Collect all your paroled prisoners, and have them ready to be sent up to Louisville.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

GALLATIN, November 14, 1862.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Have sent two regiments on infantry to Hartsville; will send orders immediately to Rousseau.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

GALLATIN, November 14, 1862.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

The regiment of infantry and battery have been ordered to Colonel kennett. Mr. Anderson reports one bridge between tunnel and Gallatin finished; expects to finish another south of Gallatin by Saturday. General Steedman thinks he can clear out south tunnel in eight days. Are the michigan engineers working on the road south of Gallatin? The cavalry I want is the Fourth Indiana. There are only four companies in this department. They are now in General Sill's division. I want them for duty at my headquarters as patrols, to prevent straggling and marauding. There are also four companies of the Michigan Infantry, which would make an excellent provost guard to take charge of marauders until they could be properly dealt with.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, November 14, 1862-10 p.m.

General THOMAS:

In case Kennett has gone back to Harstville, will send the two regiments of infantry and the artillery to that place. It will give him a chance to operate. Crittenden is ordered to advance one brigade to Rural Hill, and make arrangements to surprise the people of Lebanon.
