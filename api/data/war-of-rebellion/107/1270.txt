wounding several. Thence fell back a short distance; crossed the Petersburg and Norfolk Railroad, and proceeded to Petersburg via the plank road. Arriving near the defense of Petersburg, my advance guard was directed to charge the enemy's works, but were repulsed with the loss of 1 man killed and 4 prisoners, one of whom, Philip Andres, Company F, made his escape after being captured and returned to his company. A portion of the carbineers of my regiment were dismounted to act as skirmishers against the enemy in their works. The remaining portion of the regiment was divided and placed at different points of attack along the rebel line. After some sharp skirmishing the rebel line was stormed and carried, capturing many prisoners and one 12-pounder howitzer, with full team of horses. After the capture of the first line of works my regiment was ordered on to Petersburg, at which point we were repulsed and ordered to fall back, returning to camp at 11.30 o'clock last night. Inclosed is a correct list of casualties in my regiment, so far as known.*

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS ELEVENTH PENNSYLVANIA CAVALRY,In the Field, near Hatcher's, Va., June 17, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report of operations of my regiment in front of Petersburg:

In obedience to verbal instructions received from headquarters Second Cavalry Brigade, June 14, 1864, I have the honor to state that I left the camp of my regiment between the hours of 1 and 2 o'clock on the morning of the 15th instant. Crossed the pontoon bridge below Point of Rocks, on the Appomattox River. Proceeded on the City Point road toward Petersburg. The advance guard, composed of twelve men of my regiment, met the enemy's pickets, charged them, and drove them into their first line of intrenchments. The enemy at this point was found to be intrenched with artillery. In the first charge upon the enemy my advance sustained a loss of 1 corporal wounded, 2 privates captured, and 3 horses killed. While falling back with my regiment, in obedience to instructions received from the general commanding Cavalry Division, I sustained a loss of 2 horses wounded by the enemy's artillery, whose shells exploded with great precision among my regiment for a considerable length of time. Thence moved across the country and attacked the enemy in their works on the southeast side of Petersburg, at which point I was called upon for all the carbineers to be deployed as skirmishers. In this attack I had one officer (Second Lieutenant Lancaster) slightly wounded in the head. No other casualties. Returned to the camp of my regiment, near Hatcher's, Va., on the morning of the 17th instant.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. STETZEL,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Regiment.

J. F. CUMMINGS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Cavalry Brigade.
