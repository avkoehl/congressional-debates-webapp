JACKSON, MISS., November 22, 1862.

Major-General VAN DORN:

I have telegraphed to Holmes to know what he is going to do. I am promised 10,000 men from him. I leave here for you to-morrow evening.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, November 22, 1862. (Received November 26, 1862.)

General S. COOPER:

TH. H. HOLMES,

Lieutenant-General.

R. W. MEMMINGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

RICHMOND, VA., November 24, 1862.

General PEMBERTON:

The designations given to Generals Van Dorm's and Price's commands are improper. They should properly be styled "First and Second Army Corps of the Department of the Mississippi," under your command. In your personal absence both should be under the command of the senior officer present for duty.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
