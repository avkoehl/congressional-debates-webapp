(Received 7.25 p. m.)

Major THOMAS T. ECKERT:

Sherman reached here at 11 a. m. to-day and army went into position of attack, but a thunder-storm, lasting till 5 p. m., postponed battle. Enemy is in force in front, and one of his mounted brigades is near the railroad in our rear, having blown up a train with torpedo this morning, and captured a small guard at Calhoun and cut the telegraph. All repaired now. McPherson is now on left, Thomas in center, and Schofield on right. Fight or foot-race to-morrow.

J. C. VAN DUZER.

BIG SHANTY, GA., June 11, 1864 - 11 p. m.

(Received 4.30 a. m. 12th.)

Major THOMAS T. ECKERT

Washington, D. C.:

Armies accomplished nothing to-day, except to get into position. Our lines this evening are within 400 to 500 yards of the enemy, but no fighting yet. We find strongly intrenched lines at base and on slope of Kenesaw Mountain and Pine Hill, with large works commanding all the roads and the railroad. Impression is prevalent that Johnston will fight here. He was on Kenesaw to-day. Etowah bridge completed, and railroad running to our skirmish line, which insures supplies. Sherman's headquarters here. Johnston scarcely five miles from here southeast.

J. C. VAN DUZER.
