Just received dispatch from General Van Cleve, stating that 3,000 rebels are in White County, under Dibrell and Williams; many without arms, some without horses, many horses crippled, and men generally demoralized, awaiting orders from Wheeler.

Rousseau, Steedman, McCook, Granger, and Colonel Streight were at Athens last Friday. Streight moved with a column of infantry to Rogersville; Rousseau followed with cavalry. Have heard of no fighting, and can learn nothing of Wheeler; presume he has crossed river near Florence. Milroy moved from Pulaski to Chattanooga railroad; cars run here from below.

ATHENS, September 12, 1864.

General WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I ascertained yesterday that 108 men of General William's command had been detached to join General Wheeler, with the request that he make a diversion so that he (Williams) might get across Tennessee River. I immediately telegraphed General Starkweather, at Pulaski, and Colonel Sipes, at Columbia, to use every means to intercept party. Have just received following telegram from Colonel Sipes:

COLUMBIA, September 12, 1864.

Captain Lamson, with 100 men, sent after the party you notified me of yesterday, has just come in, bringing 2 officers and 32 men prisoners. He surprised them on Swan Creek, and met with complete success. No loss on our side.

Colonel, Commanding.

Your telegram of yesterday giving information of whereabouts [sent] to Major-General Rousseau at Pulaski to-day.
