HEADQUARTERS,Hatcher's, October 27, 1864-7.30.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I have forced the crossing after a little brisk firing. It was held by Young's brigade of cavalry. Firing has been heard in the direction of Gregg, but nothing from Parke. I am a little anxious about this last matter. The water in Hatcher's Run is about waist deep, except at the ford. The enemy had felled timber in it.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

General HUMPHREYS:

I have sent this to Warren, urged him to push to the run, and get a part of his force over at least, and communicate with Hancock. What is the condition of affairs at your front now?

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 27, 1864-9 a.m. (Received 10.40 a.m.)

Major-General HANCOCK:

Your dispatch received. Parke has confronted the enemy on the Hawks' road and is pushing them back to their works. I fear there is no chance of his getting into them. Warren is working his way to cross Hatcher's Run on Parke's left-slow work, having to make a road. It would be well for you to keep up a communication with Warren, to ascertain his progress. I will direct him to communicate with you. I will advise you of all that happens as it occurs.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 27, 1864-10.45 a.m. (Received about 12 m.)

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

General Warren finds the enemy intrenched on a line running near to Armstrong's mill pond. He has not crossed any of his men yet, but will cross a division at once at Armstrong's Mill, and will follow with the rest of his command. Look out for your right flank and see that there is no enemy between you and Hatcher's Run.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
