JULY 30, 1864.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

I respectfully recommend that our troops be directed to intrench and hold what we have, connecting on the right and left with our old line.

J. WHITE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, July 30, 1864.

Brigadier-General WHITE,Chief of Staff:

I have no discretion in the matter. The order is peremptory to withdraw. It may be best to intrench where we are for the present, but we must withdraw as soon as practicable and prudent.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

[First indorsement.]

Division commanders will instruct in accordance with the within dispatch, the officers on the line to consult and determine the time of evacuation.

By order of Major-General Burnside:

JULIUS WHITE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

[Second indorsement.]

Let the batteries bear upon the fort on the left of the Suffolk road.

J. F. H[ARTRANFT].

IN THE CRATER, 12.40.

Generals GRIFFIN and HARTRANFT:

It will be impossible to withdraw these men, who are a rabble without officers, before dark, and not even then in good order. Please let me know what your plans are.

W. F. BARTLETT,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

[Fourth indorsement.]

I think the best way to withdraw is by making attack from our pits and batteries, bearing on our right and left-the men here are a rabble-and then let them withdraw immediately, whenever you approve the plan. They are suffering very much from [want of] water, and the troops cannot well be organized.

J. F. HARTRANFT,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

[Fifth indorsement.]

I concur in the above.

S. G. GRIFFIN,

Brigadier-General.
