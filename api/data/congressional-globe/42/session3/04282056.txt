THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 1,
The next amendment was to strike out lines
eighty-five and eighty-six, in the following
words:
Ff>r the improvement of Ashtabula harbor. Ohio
$16,000.
Mr. SHERMAN. I believe the Senator
from Michigan is now satisfied that that ought
not to be stricken out.
Mr. CHANDLER. There are two railroads
just completed that make this a very import-
ant harbor for the reception and discharge
of a very large amount of freight.
Mr. EDMUNDS. How. much is discharged
there?
Mr. CHANDLER. Many millions of tons
will be annually.
Mr. EDMUNDS. How much in value?
Mr. CHANDLER. I have not the statistics
before me.
Mr. BUCKINGHAM. The committee, as
I understand them, reported to strike out this
clause because the commerce wasyetin an-
t.icipation. The Senator from Ohio suggests
that, in consequence of railroads which are to
be built there, this commerce will increase.
The committee thought, inasmuch as there
were fourteen feet of water in the harbor now,
and less than four thousand tons of merchand-
ise brought into the harbor last year, it was
hardly worth while to make an appropriation
in anticipation of commerce in the future.
Mr. SHERMAN. I have no doubt the Sen-
ator from Connecticut acted upon the inform-
ation he had before him. There is a special
report from General Humphreys in regard to
this harbor. Two railroads that have recently
been built connect this harbor with the coal
mines of Mahoning valley, and at this point
the iron ore from the Lake Superior country
reaches the coal, and a very large trade is now
going on. It is true it is a new trade, but a
very important one. I know very little about
the facts except what I gather from the official
documents. 1 understood the Senator from
Michigan was satisfied that the appropriation
ought to be made, and I have no doubt of it
from the information I have on the subject.
It is estimated for, and I see no reason why it
was stricken out.
Mr. BUCKINGHAM. Considering the great
depth of water there, fourteen feet, would it
not be advisable to wait another season?
Mr. SHERMAN. 1 think not. I think it
is important to make the appropriation now.
Vessels load there with iron and very heavy
substances.
The amendment was rejected.
The nest amendment of the Committee on
Commerce was to strike out lines eighty-seven
and eighty-eight, in the following words :
For tho improvement of Conneaut harbor, Ohio,
$400.
Mr. SHERMAN. That appropriation is so
insignificant that I do not care about it.
Mr. CORBETT. It does not make much
difference, but I understand the railroad there
is occupying this pier and it was thought by
the committee that the railroad should keep
it in repair; that the Government ought not
to be compelled to keep in repair a pier that
is wholly devoted to a railroad company. I
hope the clause will be stricken out.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was in line ninety-
five, after the words " Oak Orchard," to insert
the word "harbor."
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was on page 6, after
line one hundred and twenty, to insert the
following clause:
For construction of the lock and dam on the Mis-
sissippi rivor, at Meeker's Island, Minnesota, ac-
cording to the surveys and plans of the War Depart-
ment, ^25,000: Pi ovided. That all lights and claims
m and to the land grant made to the State of Min-
nesot/i for the above work, by act approved July 23,
jhus, shall be fully relinquished to the United States
before any of this appropriation is expended.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was on page 0, line
one hundred and thirty-one, to reduce the ap-
propriation for the improvement of the Illinois
riverfrom $100,000 to $50,000.
Mr. LOGAN. I hope that amendment will
not be agreed to. 1 cannot understand why
the proposition is made to reduce the esti-
mates for the Illinois river one half. Illinois
does not seem to have a very large share in
this bill. I find $00,000 for the harbor at
Chicagt); $40,000 for Calumet; and $100,000
for the Illinois river, and the estimates are
much larger. One hundred thousand dollars
was appropriated by the House in accordance
with the estimates for the Illinois river, and I
hope this amendment reducing the amount
will not be agreed to.
The amendment was rejected.
The next amendment was on page 7, line
one hundred and forty-five, in the clause mak-
ing appropriation for the improvement of the
Tombigbee river, to strike out after the word
"expended " the words " between Fulton and
Aberdeen,"
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amenment was on page 7, to strike
out lines one hundred and forty-nine and one
hundred and fifty, in the following words:
For the improvement of the White and St. Francis
rivers, $30,000.
Mr. CLAYTON. I should like to ask the
chairman of the committee what the reasons
were that governed the committee in striking
out this appropriation. It seems to me the
appropiiatiou made by the House ought to be
concurred in.
Mr. CHANDLER, The Senator will notice
that in the line below there is $00,000 appro-
priated for the Ouachita river.
Mr. CLAYTON. Thatis notto.beexpended
in Arkansas, but below in Louisiana.
Mr. CHANDLER. But the committee pro-
pose to strike out the words 'โข in Louisiana."
It is a typographical error on the part of I he
printer that those words are not in brackets,
indicating that the committee recommended
that they should be stricken out. I think the
Senator will be entirely satisfied when he sees
the action of the committee.
Mr. CLAYTON. I doubt very much the
propriety ot making improvements on the
Ouachita river in Arkansas at this time.
Mr. BUCKINGHAM. If the Senator will
allow me to say one word I think I can give
one reason for the amendment. If I remem-
ber aright the report in regard to the surveys
stated that the navigation was obstructed by
shoals, and the plan of improving the naviga-
tion of the river was substantially an experi-
ment.
Mr. CLAYTON. What river is the Senator
speaking of?
Mr. BUCKINGHAM. Ispeakof the White
and St. Francis rivers.
Mr. CLAYTON. I think that is a mistake.
The White river is navigable nearly all tho
year round. It is one of the finest rivers in
the Southwest. Itis, perhaps, of more advan-
tage to commerce than the Arkansas river. It
is a deep river, but is obstructed with snags.
A great many vessels have been sunk by reason
of the snags. The Senator probably has refer-
ence to some other river. There is one pecu-
liarity of the White river: it is very deep,
navigable nearly all the year round, and is a
very important river indeed. I think the clause
as it came to us from the House ought to be
concurred in. So far as the improvement of
the Ouachita river is concerned I doubt very
much whether the expenditure should be in
Arkansas, because T think the best policy is
to commence below and work upward. Of
course it is unnecessary to remove shoals above
while there are shoals below.
The PRESIDING OFFICER put, the ques-
tion on the amendment, and declared that the
ayes appeared to prevail.
Mr. CLAYTON. I ask for a division.
Mr. ALCORN. I do trust Ihere will be no
effort to strike out this appropriation, Here
are the two most important rivers in the South-
west, the navigation of which is important to
that country, obstructed as these rivers are by
snags. If any Senator will cast his eyes over
this bill and look at it, be will come to the
conclusion that a great deal of charity ought
to be extended toward the rivers in the South .
and Southwest.
Mr. SPRAGUE. You are right about that;
the appropriation ought to be given, and we
will vote it.
Mr. ALCORN. Very well; I will say
nothing more then.
Mr. CHANDLER. The committee on ex-
amination thought it well to recommend that
this clause be stricken out. As the Senator
from Arkansas observes, the obstructions are
snags, bars, &c. The matter, however, is in
the hands of the Senate. I have before mo
the reports of the engineers, but they give
very little information.
Mr. ALCORN. I hope the Senator from
Michigan will withdraw his opposition to this,
and let the clause remain in the bill.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair
will put the question again on the amendment
ot tho committee to strike our, this clause.
The amendment, was rejected.
The Chief Clerk continued the reading of
the bill, as follows :
For tho improvement of tho Ouachita river, in
Louisiana, $60,000.
Mr. CHANDLER. As the bill was sent !o
the printer the words "in Louisiana" were
stricken out. I therefore move to strike out
the words "in Louisiana," leaving the place
of expenditure at the discretion of the en-
gineers.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment of the Committee on
Commerce was on page 7, line ono hundred
and fifty-live, to reduce the appropriation "for
the improvement of the Mississippi river, be-
tween the mouth of the Missouri river and the
mouth of the Ohio river," from ยง200,000 to
$100,000.
Mr. SCHURZ. I am sure I need not tell .
the Senate that improvements in the Missis-
sippi river are for the general interest of com-
merce. I have the reports of the engineer
department before me. In one report the
estimates are given as follows :
For erection ot dike at harbor of Alton six feet above
low water  $40,000 00
For protection of two miles of bank at
Sawyer's bond  142,2U 62
For extension and raising of dikes in
northern harbor of St. Louis 107,023 90
For survey of the Mississippi river from
St. Louis to the mouth of the Ohio
river  30,000 00
Total  409,535 52
The House reduced that to $200,000, but
the committee of the Senate now propose to
reduce it still further to $100,000. The
engineer intrusted with these works, Lieuten-
ant Colonel Reynolds, reports :
"I do not think the improvements lequired at
that and tho other points above Kinimswiek can bo
mado for less than $200,000, thus swelling tho total
amountof the approximate estimate for deepening
thechaniiel from this point to the moutli of the Ohio
river to $893,895.
" Tho continuanco of very low water throughout
a large portion of tho past season has, in my opin-
ion, demonstrated tho absolute necessity of prompt
measures to deepen the channel at any cost."
I therefore ask that the amendment of the
committee be disagreed to.
Mr. BUCKINGHAM. I have no doubt the
Senator is right, that that amount of money
could be expended on that liver, and even a
much larger amount could undoubtedly be ex-
pended and be of some benefit to commerce ;
but the question is whether this Government
can afford to make all the. improvements that,
ate necessary. Believing that thete was great
doubt in legavd to that point, without having
any objections to clearing the obstructions of
