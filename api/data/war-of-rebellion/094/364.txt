Railroad, and would enable us to change our base to Decatur and operate on Hood's flank and rear as he retreated into Alabama. I will send transports with provisions and forage, under convoy, the Eastport. Bear Creek bridge is from five to eight miles from Eastport, on the south side of the Tennessee. I think General Hatch can do this, and, if successful, it will be a most important service. Answer immediately.

Lyon was ten miles from Hodgensville, on the Greensburg road, at daylight yesterday morning, toward Greensburg; reported to have 800 and one piece of artillery. We made a forced march from Ashbysburg to Elizabethtown in forty-eight hours. Arrived in time to save the bridge and drive off a battalion sent to burn the trestle-work. Brigade will move to-day. Horses jaded and want shoes.
