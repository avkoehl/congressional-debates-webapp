Mr. LANDRUM. I move to reconsider the
vote by which the House refused to excuse my
colleague, [Mr. Davidson.]
Mr. BOULIGNY. 1 move to lay that motion
upon the table.
Mr. LANDRUM. I am informed by one of
the messengers of the Sergeant-at-Arms that my
colleague is so sick that he is in bed.
Mr. BOTJLIGNY. It is wonderful that he
should be in bed at this late hour of the night.
[Laughter.] I want to know whether my col-
league has the right to move to reconsider ? Did
he vote in the majority?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. There was no
record made; and where that is the case, any

a man in feeble health; and I move that he be ex-
cused .

John J. Jones.
Mr. UNDERWOOD. I move that Mr. Jones
be excused, on account of the situation of his fam-
ily. Mrs. Jones is sick.
Mr. CURTIS. I am satisfied that tho House
is growing thinner and thinner.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. That is not a
question of order.
Mr. CURTIS. I will state what my point, of
order is. G-eiiflemen are in the habit o' leaving tne
Hall without reporting themselves to tho Chair;
and the consequence is, that they are not upon
their parol of honor to return. I have seen gen-
tlemen leave the Hall who, I am satisfied, have
not reported themselves to the Speaker. What is
the use of remaining here if we permit gentlemen,
after they have answered to their names, to leave?
I raise, then, this point of order: that gentlemen
must report themselves to the Chair before they
leave the Hall.
The SPEAKERpro tempore. The Chair would
state that, so far as he knows, gentlemen have
reported themselves.
Mr. BOULIGNY. All who are out are upon
their parol of honor, and they will be back soon.
Mr. UNDERWOOD. I hope the reporters
will not report the condition of the members of
the House of Representatives. Their sickness
will alarm the people abroad. If it gets out that
so many members of this House are sick as we
have ascertained to-night, the country will be
alarmed. % ^
Mr. MAYNARD. Let me srfy, in reference
to the pending motion to excuse Mr. Jones, that
his family is sick.

Charles H. Larraeee. No excuse offered.
James M. Leach.
Mr. HELMICK. Mr. Leach, of North Car-
olina, is paired off with me.
Mr. BOULIGNY. That is no excuse for his
absence. He is in town and in good health, and
has no business to be paired off.
Siieltom F. Leake. No excuse offered.
Peter E. Love. No cxcuse offered.
William B. Maclay. No excuse offered.
Robert Mallory. No excuse offered.

John J. McRae.
Mr. HICKMAN. I move that Mr. McRae

The motion was agreed to. 4
W. PoRCHEit Miles. No excuse offered.
.Toiijf S. Millson.
Mr. FRANK. I move that Mr. Millson be

be rendered.
The motion was not agreed to.

Jeter R. Riggs. No cxcuse offered.
John H. Reagan.
Mr. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Reagan staled that
he was sick, and asked the House to excuse him.
Mr. BOULIGIS Y. I object. Mr. Reagan left
the House, and in doing so, gave reasons which
wen; not satisfactory to the House.
Mr. UNDERWOOD. He said he was sick,
and I take his word for it
Mr. BOULIGNY. Of course, I do not doubt
his word at all.
Mr. LOVEJOY. He left, saying that he left in
contempt of the House. I would excuse him, if
he had simply left the House because he was
Mr. UNDERWOOD. He'roseand asked to
be excused for the evening on account of being
sick, but the House would not excuse him, and
that ruffled his temper a little, I suppose. But in
leaving, he said that he would rather leave in con-
tempt than to remain here.
Mr. BOULIGNY. It is painful to be com-
pelled to object to excusing* one of my friends—
a friend for whom I entertain the highest opinion
and respect, and I should be sorry should I say
anything here that would be derogatory to him.
Mr. UNDERWOOD. I did not misunderstand
what he said. Hi?said he had rather leave m con-
tempt than remain here in his state of health.
Mr. BOULIGNY. The gentleman made re-
marks in leaving which were not satisfactory.
Mr. UNDERWOOD. That is, as you under-
stood it.
Mr. BOULIGNY. .Yes, as I understood it;
and I cannot excuse him, and I will not.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would
remind tho gentleman from Louisiana of tho rule
■which prevents personal remarks being made,
especially while a member is absent.
Mr. BOULIGNY. Oh, of course, I make no
personal remarks.
Mr. UNDERWOOD. He asked to be ex-
cused on account of sickness; and being sick, he
would leave at tho risk of being in contempt of
the House.
The motion to excuse Mr. Reagan was not
agreed to.
Homer E. Royce.
Mr. MORRILL. I desire to state that I pre-
sume Mr. Royce left the Hall on account of the
illness of his wife, who has been confined to her
room for two or three days. I move that he be
cxcused.
The motion was agreed to.
Thomas Rckmk. No excuse offered.
Albert Rust. No cxcuse offered.
John Schwartz.
Mr. Schwartz had been previously excused
for the day.
Charles L. Scott. No excuse offered.
George W. Scranton.
Mr. VERREE. Mr. Scranton was excused
on a former call of the House, for a good reason;
and I move that he be now excused.
The motion was agreed to.
Charles B. Sedgwick. No excuse offered.
Daniel E. Sickles. No excuse offered.
Willi vm E. Simms. No excuse offered.
Otiio R. Singleton. No excusc offered.
William Smith. No excuse offered.
Daniel E. Somes. No excuse offered.

Thaddeus Stevens.
Mr. MOORHEAD moved that Mr. Stevens,
of Pennsylvania, be excused on account of ill
health.
The motion was agreed to.
John W. Stevenson, No excuse offered.
William Stewart.
Mr. HICKMAN. Mr. Stewart is too un-
well to attend. He was cxcused in the early part
of the evening. I therefore move that he be ex-
cused.
Mr.ALDRICH. I understand, from a colleague .
of Mr. Stewart, that he is not sick at all.
Mr. HICKMAN. I have no information on
the subject except what I derive from others.
Mr. Stewart was unwell in the early pait of the
evening and retired to his house. Ascertaining
that theic was a call of the House, he came up
here. He was taken unwell on his way hcie, or
after he had reached the building, and had to le-
turn, he being too unwell to eome into the l-Iouse.
Mr. CASE. I know that Mr. Stewart was
very well in the course of the afternoon.
Mr. HICKMAN. The poison is here who
saw Mi. Stewart on his road to the Capitol.
He was taken unwell acrain after he got to the
building, and he sent word to me that he was too
unwell to come in.
The question was taken; and Mr. Stewart,of
Pennsylvania, was not excused.
