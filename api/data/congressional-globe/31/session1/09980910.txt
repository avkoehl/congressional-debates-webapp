THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 6,
gentleman from North Carolina were really serious
in asking an investigation of this sort he had but
to propose his own select committee, and he ven-
tured to assert that there were not ten members on
his (Mr. B.'s) side of the House but would vote for
it. Whatever gentlemen on the other side of the
House thought proper to ask with reference to the
past Administration, he (Mr. B.) promised, on be-
half of his political friends, they should have and
have to their own hearts'content. [Cries from the
Democratic side: "Agreed, agreed."] Here was a
4 select committee for the purpose of investigating
certain grave charges against the members of the
present Cabinet. That investigation he thought,
' without improperly referring to the proceedings in
committee, he might say was likely to be a long
•and protracted one. Why, then, undertake to load
down that committee with other, and he thought
immaterial inquiries? If the gentleman would be
content to have his resolution referred to the stand-
ing committee of which he (Mr. S.) was a mem-
ber—the Committee on Foreign Affairs—he (Mr.
B.) would make that motion; he thought it exceed-
ingly foreign to the objects of the select committee;
or if he (Mr. S.) asked for a select committee, he
could have the vote of every member on this side
of the Hall. But he (Mr. B.) had no idea of see-
ing the select committee which had been instituted
to investigate important inquiries in reference to
members of the present Cabinet thus crammed with
immaterial inquiries which would delay their report
from week to week, and month to month. He did not
charge that this was the purpose of the gentleman
from North Carolina, but he did say, that if resolu-
tions were sent one after another to this committee,
they would never conclude their investigations, and
never make their report. He confessed (being a
member of the select committee) he had some
personal feelings in objecting to these various refer-
ences: he did not care to be delayed with these addi-
tional investigations. The committee had already
as much business before them as they couid get
through in a long time. He trusted that the gen-
tleman from North Carolina would modify his
resolution by providing for an independent select
committee. If the gentleman wanted the whole
of the subject of letter-writing referred to his com-
mittee, the present committee would willingly give
up that part of the subject committed to them.
Mr. STANLY, i should be glad to know if
the gentleman from Mississippi has the power of
speaking for his friends on the other side ?
[Cries on the Democratic side of "Yes:
agreed,"]
Mr. STANLY. I congratulate the gentleman
on his promotion to the premiership on that side 1
of the House j
Mr. BROWN. I make no such claim. j
Mr. STANLY. But thegentleman exercises it
without churning it. ,
The gentleman says if I am serious I can have ,
a select committee. Here is a resolution embra-
cing matter akin to those offered by the gentleman ■ '
fiom Illinois, [Mr. Richardson.] ThegtnUeman '!
is very kind. But then they have appointed a .!
committee to investigate alleged Whig misdeeds, 'j
consisting of five Democrats and four Whigs, i \
want a convnittee of five Whigs and four Demo- .
crats to investigate their misdeeds. Will the o-en-
tieman, the generalissimo of that side, inform*me i
whether I can have such a committee? I
Mr. BROWN. You can have just as good a
committee, i doubt not. * |
Mr. STANLY. Just as good a committee as :
yours! IF we have a committee of five Democrats
to four Whigs they will vote down every inquiry
we may put. I expect the Speaker will give us a \
fair committee uf five Whigs and four Democrats,
I accept ol the gemirm m's offer. Will the Clerk i
send me my amendment? i:
The amendment wan sent to Mr. Stanly,and 1
by h mi modified, as follows: jj

iVIr. COBB wished the gentleman to waive the
demand for the previous question to accept an
amendment which he wished to offer.
Mr. STANLY. Remembering' the postpone-
ment before, I move the previous question.
Mr. TH.0MPS0N, of Mississippi. Has the
resolution been modified?
The SPEAKER, it has been modified by pro-
viding for the appointment of a select committee.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question was ordered.
Mr. BROWN, of Mississippi, called for the
reading again of the resolution.
The resolution was read accordingly.
Mr. MORSE appealed to the gentleman from
North Carolina to withdraw the demand for the
previous question.
The SPEAKER. The main question has been
ordered. It is beyond the power of thegentleman
from North Carolina to withdraw the demand for
the previous question.
The question recurring on the adoption of the
resolution, was taken and decided in the affirma-
tive.
So the resolution was adopted. 9
A motion to reconsider this vote, made by Mr.
Stanxy, was, upon his motion, laid on the table.
