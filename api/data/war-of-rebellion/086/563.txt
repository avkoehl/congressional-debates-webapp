their relatives were at home during the late raid, &amp;c., and submit the same to district or department commander for his decision and order. I do not suggest, but simply desire to submit my own views, knowing that the wisdom, judgment,and patriotic heart of the department commander will devise and do for the best.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WARRENSBURG, November 14, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department of the Missouri, Saint Louis, Mo.:

One G. W. Johnston was captured south of Clinton by Captain Morton's command, of Osceola. He represented to two citizens the night before that he belonged to Price's army; that he left Price at Newtonia; Price had 25,000 men, half unarmed. As soon as he got arms for them was coming back to winter in Missouri. He, Johnston, represented that he was bearing dispatches from General Price to Brigadier-General Clark, in Howard County, Mo., who had gone there to see his family and was left; that he (Johnston) was to pilot Clark out. My opinion is that Clark is not in Howard County. The information is given for what it is worth.

SAINT LOUIS, November 14, 1864.

Colonel PHILIPS,

Commanding District of Central Missouri:

Send all captured Confederate soldiers, conscripts, &c., now in your district to the provost-marshal-general here. Everything seems to be delayed through the department. If you have prisoners at Jefferson City don't send them to Warrensburg first. Send the Thirty-third Missouri Infantry from Tipton here and all artillery of Smith's command. This order has been given frequently.

JNO. V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
