BEVERLY HOUSE, May 18, 1864-7.20 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

We opened from our rifled guns a little after 4 o'clock,but the fog and smoke made our firing very uncertain. The enemy fired back but little. We have developed a batter pretty well to our left hidden by the woods. The enemy's guns can be seen about the Court-House now that the fog has lifted. The Sixth Corps pickets are withdrawn, but I have established a line of my own and am pushing them out on my left.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

I have no report from the cavalry on my left.

MAY 18, 1864-8.30 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The enemy replied to us with about sixteen guns at 7.30 a.m. and kept it up for about twenty minutes. I have heard from the cavalry. They are down at Smith's Bridge; and have directed them to establish a picket-line along Ny River to connect with me.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

9.15 A. M.

General Crawford has pushed his pickets well out to the left and found no enemy. Colonel Kitching sent a patrol 2 miles down the left bank of the Ny, but found none of our cavalry or the enemy.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

BEVERLY HOUSE SIGNAL STATION,

May 18, 1864.

Major-General WARREN:

The atmosphere is very clear. Can see no change in the number of enemy's guns or troops in front of your corps. Our shells explode directly over the enemy's works but fall short of the Court-House.

Very respectfully,
