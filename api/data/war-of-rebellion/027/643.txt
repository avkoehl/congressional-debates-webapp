Answer. Not that I heard.

Answer. Yes, sir; he was under arms the day we surrendered. I saw him and spoke of it; at least he was with the men who were under arms in the party.

Question. Did he have his sword on?

Answer. I do not recollect that. He was with the cavalry as they entered the place. I recognized the same party, and called the attention of several to the fact that there was Rouse, the man that was paroled not long since.

Question. Were you on Maryland Heights on the Saturday they were evacuated?

Question. Did you know of any order, written or verbal, having been sent to Colonel Ford in regard to the abandonment of the heights?

Answer. No, sir.

Question. Have you any reason whatever, or have you ever had any reason, to doubt the loyalty of Colonel Miles?

Answer. I have not, in the least. I supposed, from the way he managed things there, that he was doing all he could for his country.

Question. You do not know by what authority Maryland Heights was abandoned?

Answer. I supposed by the authority of the commanding officer, commanding the forces there.

Answer. I heard him say that, in the course of the afternoon.

Question. Did he arrest Colonel Ford for this disobedience?

Answer. Not to my knowledge; he took it lightly.

Question. Did he express any dissatisfaction?

Answer. At first he did; but he did not make the demonstration that I thought an officer in command of the division should have done if an acting brigadier-general had violated an order, as he said Colonel Ford had done in evacuating the heights.
