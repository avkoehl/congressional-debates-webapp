land'1* What is it butan invi'ation. to thecommt - |
sion of trpjpasses upon the public do nam? The j
amendment of my honorable friend goes upon the I
ground that persons have, "without right, and with-
out title," entered upon, cultivated, and improved
in good faith portions of the pub'ic land; and
to quiet all such i.i then possessors, to pro-
tect ihem in the enjo}ment of their ushts,
this retrospective pre-emption policy has been
from time to time resorted to by Congress It
was this consideration which induced the pas-
sage of the act of May, 1830, to protect tbrse who
had actually settled upon the public domain prior
to 1829. It was that same pancipl  which was
manifested in the amendatory act of 1834 It was.
that samp prmcple which led to the passage of the
act of 1838, and it was that same kind and bene-
volent deling which has induced the Senator from
Vermont to offer his amendment to thf bill before
the Senate The great object of Congress was, in
passirg these various acts of legislaron, U do
what? To protect the occupant—the settler—the
man who had, without the sanction of law, af a
time previous, entered upon, and who had continued
m good faith to improve,portions of the pubic
domain. But, sir, how were the«e men regarded
anterior to the pis age of s teh pre-emption
laws? How we,e they denounced at tie
time these pre emptton laws were under the con-
sideration of tne Senate? They were called tres-
passers, land p1 ates, wrong doers, and «¡qnattetí—
every odious and npp'obnous terra was cast upon
this pom n of our citizen* This fact must b*
fre h and green in oui remembrance. The events
of the: last tui year*, connected with our leyi lation
li relation to this very «ubj-cf, cannot fail to im-
press, and dteply to imprs s, upon our minis the
importance of some changa in the character oí our
legislation. AVe have not h°sitatsd, and fMoi t
hesita'e, (after applying to our o tizens <or'ucn
acts of settlement upon the public land, the most
denunc a'ory language ) to grant unto tbe^e s^mc
citizens protection m ihe enjoyment of all the i <e -
tlement rights—to secure to them the pre emption
of the very land, ih  occupationr-f which has called
fo'th pvery foul epi'bet whici g< es to characterize
any but the a- nest ci izen.
!t !S in view oF these things-, Mr. Pre s den , and
with a perfect knowledge of whst has ¡ l, n plac,
that I am prepared for an entire change in he pre-
emption p licy     I woull no longer  limit tin-, ms-
tem to a retrospective operation   I woald no longer
confine the application of th'S principle to  s«ttle-
ments which have taken place  I would poled them
And I would go further   I would thiow oien the
door far and wide   1 would say to every mtn who
desires to become an honest settler upon our pub'ic
land, Take it, occupy and improve it, and make it
exclusively a permanent home for yours-elf and yonr
family.    In rdvocatmg this policy, I should be do
mgnowr.ng ma pecuniary point of view to my own
Government; and instead ef producing the effects
which have been described, by way of objection to
this bill, I should avoid them ail     Ins'ead of en
couragmg trespa-.se , ihis bill would prevent them
Instead of ravi mg lawless intruder* upm the pub-
lic lands,  wiihout   right  an 1 without   title,  this
would justify all entnes made with an honest in-
tent—wuh the purpo e of making permanet settle-
ments    This bill is an encouragement and a pro-
tection to the citizens of Ne v England who wish
to emigrate to the West.   The census recently ta-
ken shows that my own State has ad 1 d but little
to her population within the last ten jea's    S 'me
of the best   and most   patriotic portion of New
Hampshire have within that period settled upon
portions of the public domain     In my own excur-
sions through Mich gan, Win is, and Wiskonsan,
I have frr quently met with many a na íve^on of my
native State.   I need not say that tl ey are amoiij,
the mo t valuable portions of those eornm'Titties—
distinguished for their sobriety, industry, an] meal
worth. They have left us, and found an acceptable
home in the wilds of the West.     To some of them
yon have already granted protection and relit! from
all  apprehpnsif n  that their rights vould  ¡be dis-
turbed.   To otheisnow  residing wi hm some of
the very best sections of SIltnoi .protection has no'as
yet been extended, because these public lands have
not a? yet beer  brought into market. All are ready
and Willirg to pay in s-p'cie to the G vernment   j
the minimum price per acre fixed for the tale of
oar putlic land      1 know thece  men well—they
have been great'y abused heretofore on the floor
oi this Senate   Kr   doing ¡hat   thej    were   au
th inzed todo by the passage of the act of Mat,
1830, end the act of  1834    True,  there was no
existing la>vo1Vma; them dneet author ty to enter
the public land which had not been offered at pib-
hc sale, but they -onsid^red the acts refened to as
luving settled  the   policy   of   uV   Governrrct
But notwithstanding all thi=, antenoi to iIk pas-
sage of the law of   1838, snd whil  that mea
sure was before us,  these men  weio denounud
as  trespassers and wrorg dters for  hav,' g f-us
entered upon the public  i nds.    I v rttid no«, sir,
establish a permanent piospective pie-emp'i n     ¡
wtuld a.oid all tins kind < f letrospective legi lane i
htrcaf pr. I would ask anj one to show me the diffe -
encem the two «upposed cases which follow. Suppc ,

acts of 1830 and 1834, filty c tizens of the Siate i f
New Hampshire should l"sve th'ir ancient home

that eath should ta! e up, oectny, ¡ rd l-rap roie   in

Pre "mpuin is a part of ourpublicpil cj. I cou.d
noi be intent p ed and I would not interrupt it if
I could. The hisg Wi right in itself, and those
bold adven u ou pioneer-, who had opened to us
a way to the Western wilderness, were worthy of
all encouragement,
Mr President, the first time I visited the West,
in 1836, there were but few settlements upon the
nor hem line of Illinois, or upon the southern line
ef Wiskonsan. When I again visited that coun-
try, it was truly matter ot astonishment to a man
v.ho had conie from a State which ha 1 been peo-
pled for a century, to witne-s with what rapidity
the sections of ciun'ry to which I have referred
hrd been pctually settled within the preceding two
year , and these settlements had been made by the
hardv jeomanry of the country, upon lands which
! ad not as jet been brought into market. 1 was at
MtlaauKie a short time after Ihe public sale took
place in 1839,snd knowing that the southern coc ntie8
n Wi«kon an hid been previously settled, to some
••stent, by emigrations Irom New England, I «asin-
dued to mqaire what had tfken place at that sale
I «as inforn ed that these settlers, who might have
proved ibeir pre-emption c aims clearly under the
act of 1838, chos" to attend tne publ c sale, relying
for their pro eca n and suppo't upon the state of
publ c opinion, upon tl t force of popular sentt-
n i t Th* re ult showed that they did not look
in vain to 'hat source for protection and support.
More t>-an 'a't -i rml'nn ol dol'ars, the result of
that publ c sale, found its way into the publicTrea-
ouiy, and ninceop-twentieths of all the receipts
pr< cceded from those who had been for months in
the previous occupation of the very tracts offered
fo' «ale The sheriff of fhe county was the agent
of the settles, he prcc'aimed that the tract which
v,,is oifrred was m the occupation of A B;
it was bd off by him at the minimum
prce, and A B was permitted to hold it; and
mus lie su|e p-ocieicd, un il e\eiy actual set-
th r >va pi ec   1 in his «pui^ment rights, and suGh
shs the atf oi publ'i fcelini, that not an mdivi-
i ¡i ^ int at > pied tr intertere with the claims
ot trie settler T e. wnole malM was conducted
v th thi utmist harmony. The sheriff, as the
agent, 1 o ding n his hand the list and description
of tl.e lands ibtu o cup el, bid then  off for their
i g1 tful owners, without tie lea t interruption The
pu'l «,e tl r p i d mio the land office the amount
leqoned, itcf-ivcd the evidences of payment, and
in dtK tune will ríceivc from oar General Land
Offi'  tne proper patentf All this was accom-
ph ted by the n-ur ! orce of public opinion, the
[mi i^mle of p e e-nptu n being founded in justice
aid ngu' ihe practid* íe.essar'ly was mude to
conf -m n it No on* uoalu have dared, on that
ocj s,n, to oopose the rights i f the actual cultiva-
te . Ai i1 if ¡hj bi'l befo e ihe Sena'e becomes
tne 1 v, of the land the =e tier could at once pay
for ! is quarterfcction, without b:ing put to the ex-
ri-r e an 11 ss f time of attending a public land
• a'e Tune wou'd be, pract cally, no differencem
th  amount nceived into the Treasury. The
United States, under this oil!, would get the same
money they now did for the same quantity ol
land
The Sena o~ from Connecticut objects to the
pas age of this ti 1, and expresses himself in favor
of th amendment, because the provisions of the
bl ex end a<s sell to aliens as to citizens. And
what i= there in tthe langusge of the law of 1838
(which is rarcspective in its character) which con-
fines the operations of that ?ct exclusively to natu-
ralized citizens? What was there in the act of
May, 1830, which hm ti d it- application to native
or ti naurabzed dtizens? Not anything.' The
ae's itferred to v ent to c infirm and e«tabltsh the
rights of aliens as well as of citizens. Is there a
single line—is th re one s ngle sentiment in our
whole lard j s'em which goes to exclude foreigners
and aliens from taking up, possessing, and hold
irg ppriiors ef our pubic domain? No, sir. The
invitation ui.ccr the general provisions of our land
sj stem is j-ist a' comprehensive as the mvitatiori
urdtr the par isufar biH be/ore us The foreignei
ran now e iter any portion of the public 'and sub
,-ct to private entry. Your pre-emption law
wh ch h.'ve heretofore passed, have extended to thi
cases of aliens as well as of cuzens. All hav
al.ke participated in their benefits In the pre
eruption bills which have been passed by Congress
we have not required that the < ceupan —the heat
of a famdy—the cultivaior—-shou'd be a natura
hzed or a native citizen of the United, States
