General R. E. LEE,

Commanding:

Shall I get Pickett's division and cavalry and pursue the enemy's raiding party?

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,March 13, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I will follow the enemy with Pickett's division and three batteries of artillery as early as they can be got under way in the morning. Will you please order General Fitz Lee to co-operate with the infantry? The move will be by the Brook road toward Hanover Junction.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,March 13, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Your dispatch of this afternoon received. General Longstreet thinks that if not pursued the enemy will do very much more damage than he will do if followed. We have many wagons and considerable interests in the country he is going through which, if allowed time, he will destroy.

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,March 13, 1865.

Brigadier-General LAWTON,

Quartermaster-General, Richmond:

I expect to move in the morning with a portion of my command to intercept the enemy. Such horses as you have fit to mount the dismounted cavalry upon will help very much.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,Mach 13, 1865.

Major General G. E. PICKETT:

(Care of Lieutenant-General Ewell.)

You will move the two brigades of your division with you at Manchester out on the Brook road to-morrow morning sufficiently early to make a junction with Corse at the intersection of the Brook road and intermediate line by 10 a. m. Your march will thence be continued up the Brook road toward Hanover Junction. Supply your command with three days' cooked rations. Two batteries of Johnson's battalion of artillery and one borrowed from General Ewell will accompany you.
