Mr  B said that his object in moving to have
these papers punted, and a huge number encu- ¡

agucultmal classes of the United States the in

Iowa to be so'd as othei public lands, being on

Mi MERRICK rose,ande\pressed his doubts
whether tne bilí, m its present shape, would not
subject the mineral public lands to the operation
of the pietmption laws    In his opinión, tins bill '
would have thateffect, but as there existed doubts
on the subject, he suggested whether it would not
be better to mseit an amendment to obviate any
such difficulty As no amendment, however,
could be made at this stage of the pioceedings,
he must, therefore, move a reconsideiation of the
vote on the question of engrossment, unless, in-
deed, the Senate would by unanimous consent
insert the proposed amendment
Mi LINN thought the Senator fiom Mary-
land was entirely mistaken in theconstiuction he
had given to this bill He (Mr L ) himself would
be glad to have the right of pietmption applied
to these mineral lands, for he believed it injurious
to the interests of the States in which they were
situated that they should continue in this way in
the possession of the Government, which was
dtnving a miseiable itvenue fiom thtm by leas-
ing tin m out to individuals We were anxious
(s ml Mr L ) that they should be sold to individ-
uals who, with their cipital, would penttiati the
bowels of the tailh and bung fnth i s wealth,
and while thus eniichmg thenis ho, add to the
popuhtion and resomces of the Statr This bill,
however, did not give the light of pietmption,
fui it lould not, if it did pass this and the othei
House, and, consequently, the fuends of the
nit isuie wtie willing that these lands should be
put up to the higlnst biddei
Mr MERRICK did not coincide in the views
of the St n Uoi fiom Missouu as to the policy of
pi( tmption lights ittaeliing tin nnneial I mds by
pt isons wilt) had f stabbshtd th iriselvts on them
without the sanction of law, noi was he satisfied
that tin piovisions of the bill undti considti ition
mi^ht not bt so constiued i s to bung these lands
undt r tin operation of tin  preemption act
Mi LINN n plied, that the Suiatoi fiom
M ityland hid foigotten the piovisions of the pit-
emption law, whit h evpressly i xcluded fiom its
opt i ttions all nuneial lands and all 1 indsiescrvi d

th it undd tin woiding of this bill the mmtial
lands would not bt i xcluded fiom the right of

teniion to tin bill, tli il its pin ist olo0y is wh illy

[Mi (¡ivliiit uatl t vtiat ts limn the pt etnp
li ul ¡aw in support of his aigunit nt ] Lit was
waunly in favoi of the bill, and hid no doubt it
would be git itly to tlu luhant i_ri ol Govt rnmtnt,
as will as to the ti ict of co intiy in which tht si
lands au situalid, if these lands wtie, disposi d
of to inditidu lis If tht pitsintmodi of woik-
in_r llu in was not ant stid, thty would m a shoit
tun   bt wholly vile It ss to Government
Mi WALKER obseivt d that the motion of
tlie S( natoi fiom Maiyl ind pit si nttd the t xtiaoi-
dinaiy uli i th it a nit re di dilation of Congress
tan establish thefict wbetln i a u_'htdoes orden s

oi does not exist unitei the pitemption law of the
last session If it does, it could not be tak n
away by the pusent law, and if it dots not,
suiely no pietmption light oould be found m the
piovisions oí this bilí So Í ti fiom ¡t, the lands
wen to be pioehimed foi publitsalt asotln i lands
ot the United Statts, and in a manner wholly dif-
ft lint fiom those sold undei pietmptions In-
stead of providing for preemptions, the bill pio
vided against them Itdiclaied that tht lands
shill bt pioclaimtd foi six months, and undi i
that pioclamation they should be offtied foi sale,
aftei which, and not befoie, they may bt subject
to puvatt entiy I he motion of the Seniloi
fiom Mnyland presented tht extiaordmary spec-
tacit, th it wheie this bill did not, by any mle of
constitution, allow the ught of pittrpption, theie
should bt a itconsidciat on, foi the puipose of
introducing an a liendment to exclude such ught—
an amenumtntaltogtthei inapplicable to the case
before them If the gentleman would look at the
preemption law with moie care, he would find
that mineral lands, as well as lands reserved for
any purpose whatever, are excluded from the
opeiation of that law It surely could not for a
moment be maintained that any pietmption right
was given by this bill
Mr SMITH, of Indiana, had no doubt of the
beneficial tendency of the bill, but thought that
in oidti to guard against misconstruction there
was a necessity for adopting the amendment pio-
posed by the honoiable Senator fiom Maryland
He was in fivor of thatcouise of legislation whi-h
left as little as possible for eonstiuction The
proposed amendment, if adopted, could do no
injury It would be the safer mode to íecon-
sidei the vote, and, by adopting the amendment,
place the mattei beyond doubt
Mi MERRICK said that he had never meant
to convey the idea that either of the Senators in-
tended that the bill should include pieemption
rights His only object was to guard against
such a eonstiuction being given to it He was
very w llhng that the necessai y amendment should
be made, by the unanimous consent of the Sen-
ate, and would withdiaw his motion condition-
ally for that puipose
Mi LIJNN would say one word to the gentle-
man fiom Maiyland, to coirect an eiror into
which he had fallen, in stating that these mmeis
went on the public lands without law. This was
a vciy gieat mistake The Government of the
United States had, tlnough their agents, from
time to time, invited individuals on these lands,
for the puipose of mining, in Older that it might
derive a revenue fiom them This was the way
m which that beautiful region of Iowa and Wis-
consin was opened to settlement and cultivation
With itspect to this hill, he did not bébete it
would have been judicious to mseit the ught of
pietmption, otherwise he would gladly have seen
it done Hekntw that the eonstiuction given by
the Diptrtmtnt to the act of the last session was
exceedingly ugid,and excluded fiom preemption
all tht lands in the mining regions, and that this
construction had been extended to all the land
offi i s
Ah NILES made a few observations, in which
lie expitssed the apprehension that this act might
be so construed as to give the right of pieemp
tion, ind lead a few e\tratts from the act of the
last session, which hecompaied with the pies nt
u t, in support of the position assumed by him
As no gentleman pitsent intended that this act
should c mti t the light of pieemption, he thought
th it theie ought to be no objection to the inser-
tion of an imtudment to pit vent any difficulty on
the subji (t
Mi KlNGobsentd that the subj ct was taken
up just before he came into the Senate, and he had
not, thtiefoie, heaid the fust part ot the dtbate
His li moiable fuend, however, who bad just
tiken his stat, [Mr Nilcs,] was mistaken when
he supposed that the minenl lands wtie sui ¡tct
to tin pietmpl on laws All the rest-va'ions of
the Go\ ei nment wtie so piotected by gun ial k g-
ulations that no pietmptions of thtm could be
obtained—commencing fiom JtÜ9-30, up to the
piesent time With regard to the amtndmei ts
piopostd to this bill, he did not bébete that it was
ntctssaiy, he did not believe that any settler
could avail himself of it so as to obtain a preemp-
tion but he was not disposed to throw any ob-
stacle in the way of making that moie cleat which
some gentlemen eonsideied doubtful He was
willing to adopt such an amendment as would
leave no loom foi such a eonstiuction as gentlt-
mtn appii hendt d
Mi WALKER called the attention of the Stn-
att.ard paiticulaily of his fuend fiom Connec
tic in, to anothei poi tion of the act oi the last ses-
sion, which expiessly excluded piet_niptioiis fiom
these lands Mi W heie lead the following
