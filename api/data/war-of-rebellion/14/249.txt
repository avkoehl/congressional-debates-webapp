Captain CHAUNCEY McKEEVER:

All the information from our lookouts to-day confirm my opinion of yesterday, that the rebel force in my front is considerably reduced. A portion of their camp has been removed to-day. The pickets have been unusually quiet all day.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

Very respectfully,

General E. V. SUMNER:

All that the commanding general wishes you to do is to connect the left of your pickets with the right of Hooker's as those of the latter advance. It will not be necessary for the center and right of your pickets to go forward at all, and the commanding general thinks a regiment opposite that part of your left line of pickets which advances will be sufficient to support them in case of resistance. He also thinks
