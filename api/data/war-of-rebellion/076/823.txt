Near Sykes' House and Rough and Ready, Ga.,

September 7, 1864-4 p.m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that my command left the camp one mile and a half this side of Jonesborough at 7 o'clock this morning. We marched along the road just on the left side of the railroad to J. Cook's house, where we arrived at 9 a.m. From this point we left the railroad and marched on a road leading direct to Sykes' house, where the head of column arrived at 11 a.m. The Third and Second Divisions of my command are in line, the Third on the right, the Second on the left. The right of this line connects with the left of the Fourteenth Corps about half a mile beyond Sykes' house, and the left rests on the creek, the whole line facing nearly south. The First Division is in reserve in the rear of the Second Division. The enemy did not make his appearance to-day. Our position is good for grass and water, but forage is scarce.

Major-General.

I have the honor to report that, in accordance with orders, my corps withdraw from its position north of the battle-field of the 1st instant at an early hour this morning, and marching upon the Rough and Ready road went into position a little north of that point, where it now is.

Brigadier-General AMMEN:

I am informed that Wheeler has been driven from the Nashville and Decatur road, and is retreating eastward. Try to intercept and delay him by blocking roads and intrenching the mountain gaps. Granger, Rousseau, and Steedman are all after him. The destruction of Morgan is very gratifying.
