THE CONGRESSIO JSi AL GLOBE.
April 18,
the various forms of manufactured iron aver-
age about 60 per cent. Pig iron bears a duty
of about 55 per cent., which is less than the
general average on iron as a whole, and the
Committee of Ways and Means propose a
reduction of 22J per cent., while on many
other forms of iron they have largely increased
the duty. I have hitherto given some examples
of this inequality..
The amendment now pending provides that
all forms of manufactured iron shall be de-
creased 20 per cent, on existing rates, provided
that the rate of duty shall in no case be reduced
, below 35 per cent, ad valorem. This prop-
osition strikes me as more equitable than the
rates of duty proposed by the Committee of
Ways and Means in this bill. If that proposi-
tion shall come before us for action, I shall
vote for it in preference to the proposal of the
committee, because I wish that all the iron in-
terests shall stand together, and shall experi-
ence a relative redaction. For one I shall
not consent that pig iron shall be picked out
of the list and reduced 22J- per cent, while all
the rest are either let alone or increased, as is
the case in this bill.
Now, I desire to call attention to a doctrine
professed and repeatedly declared in the course
of this debate: that the object of the protective
policy is to protect labor rather than capital;
that the policy is devised for the benefit of the
laborer rather than the employer. I want to
test the sincerity of those who hold to this
doctrine by applying it to the article of pig
iron. I affirm that in the production of this
article t^ere is, perhaps, more labor in propor-
tion to capital employed than in any other
single form of iron. Take, for instance, the
manufacture of cut nails. A large amount of
capital is needed to build the mill, to furnish
the necessary machinery, and to purchase the
bar iron to be worked up, while the labor re-
quired to conduct the business and convert the
iron into nails is a comparatively small item.
It follows that the duty on articles of that class
gives less protection to labor than to capital.
Statistics given me by one of the Representa-
tives from Pennsylvania [Mr. Packer] show
that in his district the raw ore and coal and
limestone, before they are mined, represent
Only one fifth as much as it costs for the man-
ual labor to mine and quarry these articles
and make them ready for transportation to the
furnace. Thus there are at least four out of five
parts of pure labor which enter into the pro-
duct of pig iron; and if gentlemen are really
desirous of protecting labor itself, and not
capital, I ask why they propose an increase of
duty on the higher grade of iron, where the
capital employed exceeds in value the labor,
and a lower rate on pig iron, where capital is
the least and labor the greatest factor?
I am willing to allow a reduction of duty on
iron, provided it is a fair and equitable reduc-
tion all around ; but I do not intend that the
interest I represent shall be singled out and
reduced, while all the other iron interests scat-
tered throughout the United States are either
let alone or advanced.
I desire, sir, before taking my seat to sub-
mit some facts in reference to this interest in
my own district. I desire to say, Mr. Chair-
man, that the interest represented in northern
Ohio by myself and two colleagues who rep-
resent contiguous districts is a peculiar one in
this: we are almost the only districts in the
United States where they manufacture iron
with raw bituminous coal. We are, too, per-
haps the nearest available point in the United
States to the great mining regions of Lake
Superior. The ore from those regions is
brought down the lakes and landed at Cleve-
land, the nearest point to the iron regions of
the West where an abundance of pure coal is
found. Standing in that peculiar attitude our
people know with great exactness what it costs
to produce a ton of pig iron. I subjoin a let-
ter from a most worthy and prominent citizen
of Mahoning county, which gives a brief and
clear account of the rise and progress of this
interest:
Youngstown, Ohio, February 15.1870.
Deab Sir : In the year 1846 Messrs. Wilkerson,
Wilks & Co. built and started at Lowell, Ohio, what
was known as the Mahoning furnace, the first fur-
nace that was built. It still exists,and it is claimed
to be the first furnace in the United States designed
for using as fuel raw bituminous coal. The two fol-
lowing years, to wit, 1847 and 1848, two other fur-
naces were built and put into operation. These were
located at Brier Hill; one known as the Eagle and
the other as the Old Brier Hill furnaces. In the
years 1850 and 18ol another furnace, called Falcon,
was built and put into operation in this place. These
four furnaces were run with varying success, but
mainly at a loss, from the time of their erection till
1855, without others being built. The Mahoning
furnace financiallyruined its first owners and passed
into other bauds, as also did the Kagle and Falcon.
The Old Brier Kill was owned by Captain James
Wood, of Pittsburg, and he being very wealthy, it
was kept in first hands. In 1855 and 1856 Lake Supe-
rior ore was introduced here and found to work well
and profitably. And in 185C, I think, another fur-
nace, called Plicenix, was built and put into operation
in this city. In 1857 and 1858 one was built in Niles,
Ohio, and iu 1859 and 1860 two more were built near
Niles; also, in the same years, two more at Brier
Hill and two in this place, were built and put into
operation. From 1860 to 1866 no others were erected.
In 1866 one was built at Qirard; in 18fi7 three more
were built,two near this place and one in Hubbard;
in 1868 one other was built at this place; in 1869 one
was built at Struther's Station, five miles from here,
and there is now being built one at Niles and one at
Warren, and there are under contemplation two
otheis in the valley that will be built if the appear-
ance of the times does not forbid.
Now, as to the importance of this branch of the
business, we have now built in your district 17 fur-
naces, and 2 more in the course of erection. Each
oneof tkesefurnacesrequires m capital tobuild and
operate successfully from $150,000 to $200,000. Also,
each furnace requires about 100 men to carry on the
various branches connected therewith, to wit, the
average number at furnace will vary but little from
40; number required to mine coal 40, and for mining
the lime and transporting same, together with coal
and ore, will require i'ully20. Thus, take the 19 fur-
naces above enumerated, (17built and 2 building,)
and you have a total of l,900men directly employed,
and an investment of at least $3,506,000, and a produc-
tion of pig iron of 7,000 tons to each furnace, or an
aggregate of 136,000 tons per annum. Then take the
average of families, which, I believe, is five to each
head, and you have a population of 9,500 persons
directly supported by the works, exclusive of those
who are indirectly connected with and supported by
these works—such as farmors, merchants, millers,
brick-makers, <S:c.; also, exclusive of men required
to mine the ore on Lake Superior and transport the
same to Cleveland. In fact, I believe I am safe in
saying that these furnaces in all their ramifications
give bread to 20,000 persons.
I will to-morrow send you a full and exact state-
ment of cost ot making iron at our three furnaces for
sixteen months—a quantity exceeding 30,000 tons of
metal and taken from our periodical statements,
which we take from our books from time to time, and
to which our secretary, Mr. Crandall, will make oath
as to correctness.
Y ours, very truly,
JOHN STAMBAUGH, jr.
lion. J. A. Garfield.
Here follows an official statement from the
books of a leading furnace company as to the
cost of making iron :
Office op the Brier Hill Iron
and Coal Comfaxt,

Dear Sir: At the request of our president, John
Stambaugh, jr., I send you herewith a statement of
the workings of the three furnaces of this company
from October 1,1867, to January 1, 1870, being two
years and three months, a longer time than named
in his letter of yesterday to you, which accounts for
the larger amount of iron than he named. I have
taken this statement from the books of the company,
and know that every item is correct.

Mr. UPSON. Mr. Chairman, during the
long debate upon the bill now under consider-
ation the principles of protection and the
theories of free trade have been so ably dis-
cussed that no new argument or illustration
is now needed; but I desire to say a few words
upon the amendment which is now pending,
because the subject is one which greatly affects
the agricultural, manufacturing, and commer-
cial interests of the district which I have the
honor to represent.
In order to show the extent of the iron
manufactures of Cleveland and its immediate
vicinity I send to the Clerk's desk to be read
the following letter, of the correctness of
which I have no doubt.
The Clerk read as follows:
Cleveland, Ohio, Marc.h 3,1870.
Dear Sib: The following statistics of the iron
manufactures of Cleveland and immediate vicinity
have been compiled with much care, and are without
doubt as near correct as may be, in the absence of
any thorough organization for obtaining such inform-
ation :
Capital employed during the year 1809  $2,810,000
Number of men employed during the year
1869  3,250
Tons ofore used in blast-furnaces andmills, 38,700
Tons of coal consumed  273,049
Tons of pig metal used  57,950
Amount paid for labor $1,260,503
Value of product  ^8,750,000
Iron ore imported con stwise during the year
1869 at the port of Cleveland, (tons)  343,507
Foreign iron ore imported, (tons)  17,830
A large proportion of the ore imported was tran-
shipped to the interior of this State and to Pittsburg
for use in blast-furnaces and mills.
The above includes only the manufactures of pig
iron, railroad iron, merchants' bar, and castings in
Cleveland and within a radius of six miles, and does
not includc manufactures from the same.
Very respectfully, yours, D. O. COLE.
Hon. W. II. Up SOX, Washington, D. C.
Mr. UPSON. At Akron and other places
in the district the manufacture of iron is also
extensively carried on, but the statistics are
not now in my possession. The burdens of
taxation in every form should be removed as
rapidly as possible; but we know that a large
amount of revenue must be raised for the pay-
ment of the necessary expenses of the Govern-
ment, the interest of the public debt, and the
payment each year of a part—I think it should
be a small part—of the principal. I believe
that the greater part of this revenue should be
obtained from duties levied upon imports, be-
cause that mode of collecting a revenue is less
expensive than any other, less liable to frauds,
less objectionable in the manner of its collec-
tion, and less burdensome to the people ; and
also because if a tariff is properly adjusted it
will afford protection to all of our interests.
It should not discriminate in favor of special
interests or favored classes, but should promote
the prosperity of all alike. Those articles which
are really necessary to the comfort of all the
people, and which we do not produce, should
either be placed on the free list or admitted at
the lowest rate ot duty. The higher rates
should be levied upon articles of luxury, and
upon articles which can be manufactured in
this country, and in the manufacture of which
our own labor needs protection against com-
petition with the ill-paid labor of Europe. In
accordance with these principles I have advo-
cated the^ placing of high duties upon foreign
cigars, wines, brandy, laces, and silk, and the
reduction of duties upon tea and coffee, even

and State taxes, insurance, ic.
