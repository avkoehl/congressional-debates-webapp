HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 8, 1864-1 p.m.

Major-General SEDGWICK:

You will proceed with your whole corps to Spotsylvania Court-House and join General Warren in a prompt and vigorous attack on the enemy now concentrating there. Use every exertion to move with the utmost dispatch.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS, May 8, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I sent Lieutenant-Colonel McMahon to say that General Warren, having examined the ground, had formed a plan of attack and is about to carry it out. A division and brigade of the Sixth [Corps] will commence on the left, to be followed up if any impression is made. There is a very thick tangle to get through before reaching them.

JOHN SEDGWICK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY,Todd's Tavern, May 8, 1864-9 a.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Lieutenant-General Grant desires that you occupy a position as near Alrich's as you can get to cover our trains from a possible attack down the plank road. Sedgwick will have a division at Piney Branch Church, where these headquarters will be. You should connect with this division.

C. B. COMSTOCK,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

You should to-day and to-night issue five days' rations from to-morrow. You will probably remain in position till some time to-morrow morning.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY,Piney Branch Church, May 8, 1864-9.40 a.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Commanding Ninth Army Corps:

Lieutenant-General Grant desires that like General Meade you send your wounded to Fredericksburg, where your medical officers will act in conjunction with the medical director of the Army of the Potomac in establishing temporary hospitals and moving these wounded thence to Washington via Aquia Creek. If you are not able to move all your wounded at once, you will, keeping your own ambulances with you, send your empty quartermaster wagons under flag of truce to the battle-field with supplies and get the rest of the wounded and move them to Fredericksburg.

C. B. COMSTOCK,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.
