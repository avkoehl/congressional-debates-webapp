Major-General SHERIDAN,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you strengthen the detachment at Grove Church by such force as you deem necessary; that General Gregg be directed to hold his division in readiness to move at a moment's notice, and that a portion of General Wilson's division, not less than a brigade, be held ready to move and unite with Gregg, or act in conjunction with him by crossing at lower fords of the Rappahannock (Ellis' Ford).

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 23, 1864.

General GREGG,

Commanding Second Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: Inclosed you will find a note from General Humphreys in reference to the enemy's cavalry. Instruct the regiment at Morrisville to push scouts well out toward Tackett's Mills, and keep a bright lookout yourself. I do not think they intend to cross. They are covering that flank, perhaps, in anticipation of some general movement of ours.

Yours, truly,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

I do not know whether the major-general commanding informed you this morning that information reached him last night that the enemy were concentrating all their cavalry at Hamilton's Crossing. Hamilton's Crossing is a few miles south of Fredericksburg, at the railroad crossing of the Massaponax River.
