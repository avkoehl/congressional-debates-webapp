MAItY A. DAVIS.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Indiana. I desire to
ask that in the case of the bill granting a pen-
sion to Mary A. Davis, instead of the adverse
report being accepted and the papers being
laid on the table, the bill be taken up for action
now, in order that 1 may make a few remarks
on the subject.
Mr. MULL1NS. I shall object to that.
Mr. MILLER. I will merely say to the gen-
tleman that the unanimous opinion of the
committee was that this case was not one upon
which they would be justified in reporting
favorably.
Mr. WASIIRURN, of Indiana. The House,
I think, will not object to my making a few
remarks on this bill when I state that the ease
occurred in my own regiment, and that I know
more about it than any committee can know.
Tiie SPEAKER. The gentleman can dis-
cuss the bill if the Committee on invalid Pen-
sions will grant him the time. This evening
was set apart for business of that committee.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Indiana. This is a
pension case.
Mr. PE11HAM. If there is anvthing in the
case meritorious the committee will be glad to
hear it and to report favorably if the facts show
ihat we can do so. From the papers before the
committee we did not feel authorized to report
on it favorably. The gentleman from Indiana
can come before the committee, and if he can
convince us, well and good.
