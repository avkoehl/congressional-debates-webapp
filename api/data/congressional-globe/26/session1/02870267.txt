M
justifiable only in cases of extreme emergency, and
when other modes failed The gentleman from
Virginia, [Mr. Jonss,] in tp-aking of the two
modes, said if they resurted to a loan, the Govern-
ment would have to go to the shavers of the land,
and that every body knew how the Government
wou'd fate in such a case. The i<sue of Treasury
notes, he contended, would be placing the creditors
of the Government as much at the mercy of the
capitalists and shavers. It, in fact, relieved the
Government from the responsibility of being
shaved, and shifted it apon the helpless creditors,
who were the least able to bear it. If the Govern-
ment resorted to a direct loan, it would bring that
much specie into the country, and tend towards its
relief; but if it resorted to the issue of notes, bear-
ing six per cent. íntereit, it would sack up the
capital which is now used to relieve the mercantile
community.
It would further oppress the community, which
was now experiencing such extreme suffering. The
banks, instead of loaning to the merchants, and
discounting the business paper of the community,
would invest their means in ihrse notes.   He m-
sis ed that it was very inconsistent in an Adminis-
tration which argued against a paper representa-
tive of value, and, m the ver? face of it, to ask for
five millions of paper circulation.   He believed the
only proper and honest remedy to meet the defect
was to raise money by a direct loan.   Mr. C. in
the course <>t his remaiks, adverted to the compro-
mise act, contending that Massachusetts was not a
party to it, and that when the proper time arrived,
he would be for disturbing it, by levying an ín-
crea eJ duty on certain articles to replenish the na-
tional Treasury, which was being exhausted by its
operation, and particularly luxuries, such as wines
and silks from beyond the Cape of Good H< ps.
Mr. C. dwelt at length on the increase in the ex-
penditures of the Government during the past and
present Administrations; which, he said, was far
beyond the increased resources and population of
the country. The civil list alone had doubled,
while the population in the same given period had
increased but one-fourth, or from twelve to fifteen
millions He examined into the causes which had
produced it, and also into the history of the pas-
sage of the appropriations, to show where the re-
sponsibility rested for the excess of those appropri-
ations beyond the estimates of the Department,
and contended that the Opposition were not re*p jn-
sible to the extent which had been charged upon it.
He was wil'ing to take his share of the responsi-
bility for so much of the excess as had been caused
by the party with which he acted. They were
such as could be defended. Mr. C. before con-
cluding, gave way to
Mr. MARVIN, on whose motion the committee
rose, and reported progress, and had leave to sit
again.
On motion of Mr. M.
The House aljourned.

BANKS OF THE DISTRICT
The bill to regulate the issuing and circulating of bank paper
in the District of Columbia, being taken up,
Mr MERRICK hoped it would not be pressed at this time,
but that an opportunity might be afforded to the Cemmmee on
the District of Columbia to examine the question, so as to ena
ble them to present their views to the Senate He thought that
in the course of a week they would be prepared to do so, and
trusted the delay would be acceded to by the Senator who intro-
duced the bill
Mr TAPPAN said he had no intention of hurrying the pgg
sage of the bill before its provisions were thoroughly examine(j
when he had little doubt the chairman of the Committee on .'

ingit

LAWS OF NATIONS
The following resolutions submitted by Mr CALHOUN on

Resolved, 'lhat a ship or vessel on the high seas, in time
of peace, engaged in a lawful voyage, is, according to the laws
of nations, under the exclusive jurisdiction of the State to
which her flag belongs, as much so as if constituting a part of
its own domain
Resolved, That if such ship or vessel should be forced, by
stress of weather or other unavoidable cause, into the port of
a friendly power, she world, under the same laws, lose none of
the rights appertaining to her on the high seas, but, op the con
trary, she and her cargo, and persons on board, with their pro
perty, and all the rights belonging to their personal relations, as
established by the laws of the State to which they belong,
wou d be under the protection which the laws of nations ex
tended to the unfortunate under such circumstances
Resolved, Tnat the brig Enterpnze, which was forcf d una
voidably by stress of weather into Port Hamilton, Bermuda
island, while on a lawful voyage on the high seas from one | art
of the Union te another, comes within the principles embraced
in the foregoing resolutions, and that ihe seizure and detention
of the negroes oil board by the local authorities of the is'anrl
was an a< t in violation of the laws of nations, and highly unjust
to our cit zens to whom they belong
Mr CALHOUN submit etl his views at length on the rcso
lutions, [which will be published at an early day,] and after
some remarks from Messrs GRUNDY and KING,
On mo ¡on bv Mr KING, the resolutions were referred to the

Friday, March 13 h, 1840

tee on Roads and Canals was reconsidered, and the resolution
was commuted to the Committee on Commerce
Oil motion of Mr EVERETT, the claim of Joseph Parker,
which had been reported unfavorably upon by the Committee
on Revolutionary Claim', was recommitted to ihat committee
The SPEAKER announced that the question before the House
was the resolution reported from the Committeeof Eectionsby
Mr Campbell chairman, proposing to print all (he documents
and testimony in relation to the New Jersey disputed election,
and the amendment thereto submitted by the gentleman from
Louisiana, [Mr Garland ]
Mr FILLMORE (by permission ofMr Jenifer) rose and
said, in substance, that since he spoke yesterday, he had disco
vered a mistake in crpying one of the resolutions of the com-
mittee to which he referred He understood the mistake in co
pying, occurred in consequence of the resolution having been
adopted m parts, anda portion of the first part was stricken
out before the latter was added, and this was overlooked by
the person who copied it The resolution should read as fol
lows
~9.ettA.vta, That we will now take up the testimony which
has been leferred to this committee in the New Jersey ease, and
if, during the investigation of the subject, it shall be desired by
either party to furnish additional testimony, that then Ihe par
ties te allowed such reasonable time as may be determined by
the committee, to take such addi lonal testimony, in the man
ner prescribed by the laws of New Jersey relating to contested
elections, unless the parties agree upon some other mode which
may be sanctioned by theconimittee "
As he was desirouv of doing equal and exact justice to all,
he deemeditdue to the House, to the commutee, and to him
self, to make this correction, and he hoped that the Reporter 
who might notice his remarks, would make the correction
Mr JENIFER of Maryland, who was entitled to the floor
from yesterday morning, again addressed the Houte in support
of the amendment until the expiration of the morning h ur,
without concluding his speech He attacked the course of the
committee with much seventy.and called up Mi Rives and Mr
Campbell, the chairman, who corrected many of his Btate
mente distorting the facts involved in the action of the commit-
tee.
Mr J was on the floor, when, the morning having expired,
Mr JONES, chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means
called for the orders of the day, and asked that the House
would resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole, for the pur
pose of resuming the consideration of the Treasury note bill
He knew that many geatlemenwere anxious to continué the.
consideration of the subject now before the House, but he felt
that a lenseof duty demanded of him an effort to press through
the important measure he wished to take up The wants of
the Government called for speedy action upon u
Mi MEDU I. thought the course gentlemen had pursued in
the discussion on the New Jersey case, by their attacks on the
committee, and bv occupying several morning hours, without
affording an opportunity to leply, was very unjust, and hoped
the subject would be disposed of before proceeding to any
other business He trusted the House would, by universal
consent, agree to finish this subject
Mr RIVES of Virginia also expressed a wish that the gen-
tleman from Maryland [Mr Ienifer] might, by universal con
senl, be permitted to finish his remarks
Mr JONES said the Treasury note bill was a subject of too
much importance to ym*s by, and could not consent, and as ob
jectiun had been made, he moved a suspension of the rules, to
enable him to submit a motion to go into Committee of the
Whole on the state ol the Union, to take it up, and the question
being laken, the motion was disagreed to
The SPEAKER asked leave, and before going to the or
ders of the day, laid before the House a communication
fiom the President of the United States, in compliance with a
resolution of the House of the 2d of March, 1809, enclosing com
municanons from the several Executive Departments, trans-
mitting a list ol officers who derive their appiiniment from the
President and 3enate, who have been dismissed from office
since the 3d of March, 1789  which was read, and.
On motion of Mr CAVE JOHNSON, ordered to lie on the
table, and be punted
Also, laid before the House a letter from the Comptroller of
thelreasuiy transmitting a statement ef the balances on the
books of the Register of the Treasury, which have remained
due an I unsettled more than three years prior to the 30ih Sep
tember, 1839; which was read, ordered to he on the table, and
be printed
On motionof Mr BIDDLE, the House then resolved itself in
to Committee of the Whole, [Mr Dates in the Chair,] and
took up the bills on the pin ate calendar, to many of which,
there being no objection, they were laid aside to be reported lo
the House
The bill for the relief of the ass gnee of Low, Taylor and Co
was taken up in its order and after s< me remarks from Messrs
ATHERTON, HABERSHAM, L WILLIAMS, CUSHING,
and RU-íSüLL, was laid aside to retain its place on the calen
dar until the gentleman who leported it [Mr Lawrence]
should be present to explain us principles
The bill for ihf rebel of the representatives of John Wilkin
f on was next taken up, and after a few remarks Irom Messrs
COOPER of Georgia, RU SELL, PETR1KIN, and GOODE,
as to the principle involved in the bill, (it being a bill to in
demnify an individual for the Iot.s of a certain house in which
munitnn of war had been stored by the Government, ant! was
destroyed by ihe English during the war,) it was laid aside to be
leported to the House
The bill for the relief of Bailey and De Lord was taken up in
its order, when
Mr Il\Nl> sent lo the Chair an amendment, proposing to
give the sum of------dollars, and interest in full of the claim
This anifndment being read, Mr H advocated it at length He
said that it fully appeared by the papers, that in 811 and 1815
the ai my at Pittsburgh  eie without pay, owing to the extreme
embarrassments of the General Government, which were so
great, that it ceukl not, in that vicinity, get trus ed lor a stack (f
hay without secunty That the army wis without necessaries
That pay was promised from mouth to month until the troops
were in a state o( mutiny from repeated disappointments In
this crisis, the officers applied to Bailey and Delord, wealthy
merchants of Platisliurgh, for relief Bailey and Delord fur
nished supplies to the oflicers and soldiers upon thatapplica
Hon, in the way shown by the report, to ncaily 830,000 These
supplies were lurmshed upon the request ot the oflicers, and
their assurant e that when the troops were paid, they should te
paid said advances That after making large advances, Bailey
and Delord became alarmed, and hesitated, upon which General
Macomb urged thefn by no means to stop, and repeated the
most positive assurance that they should be paid in full when
Ihe troops were paid off, upen which solicitation and assurance
they continued supplies That a large port on of the army
was ordered away from Plattsburgh before receiving any pay,
by which Bailey and Deloid received very Utile That after
wards they sent to the various stations to which the (roops weie
scattered, to ob am payment when Ihe troops paid off but from
obvious causes but lntte was received, and that hardly paid the
a t ndant expenses That the pioof went to ehow a total loes i f
SIP OK) or $20 000, and Bailey and Delord were made bankrupt
thereby.
He (Mr H) respectfully dis^pnted from the principle ad.
v meed by the Committee of C aims, that this case was anala-
gous to that of sutler Sutlers were governed by known reju
lauons and guided themselves accordingly Here, as the pa-
péis fully showed, the advances were made upon the earnest
solicitations and most solemn assurances of the officers, fully
warran ed by ihe exigencies of the case, that they should be
paid Without these, no advances would hat o been made
He dwelt, as to this point, upon the facts appearing by the pa
pels, parts of which he read Ho contended that such was the
distress and insubordination in the army that the officers were
warranted in making these assunncjs, and it was a case of
sheer pistice and nogratuity The assurances of the oflicers,
to say nothing of the effect ol (he quasi acceptance ofthe orders
by the paymasters, were bind i.g upon the Government, and
analagous to the cases of necessaries furnished to a ship in a fc-
reign port in distress, or to a child eloigned The hill proposed
to pay what could be substantiated by vouchers, and where the
Government had not pad the soldiers This, he insisted, ¡was
entirely nugatory, a mockery of justice, for the papers showed
Ihe vouchers had been destroyed by the conflagration ofpeti-
tioner's house, and, besides, probably nothing was left due from
the Government to the soldier
The claim (said Mr H ) originated in a deed of patriotism,
which perhaps, prevented those «ho achieved the victory at
Plattsburg Irom the disgrace of mutiny, butwhich, by its pecu
niary effects, had sent one ofthe claimants to the giave a bee
gar, and left the other to wear away the remnant of a long life m
poverty
Mr DAWSON (one of the Committee of cl1"m")"PP5fe^
the amendments He thought it dangerous to allow officers in
the army to bind Government by such contracts It was a
power not tobe thus confided in that loose man*er The <
mittee thought the principle adopted by them uw true ope
