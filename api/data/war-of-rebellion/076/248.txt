NEAR ATLANTA, GA., July 25, 1864-8 a. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I find it difficult to make prompt report of results coupled with some data or information without occasionally making some mistakes. General McPherson's sudden death, and General Logan succeeding to the command, as it were, in the midst of battle, made some confusion on our extreme left, but it soon recovered and made sad have with the enemy, who had practiced one of his favorite games of attacking our left when in motion and before it had time to cover its weak end. After riding over the ground and hearing the varying statements of the actors on that flank, I directed General Logan to make me an official report of the actual results, and I herewith inclose it.*

Though the number of dead rebels seems excessive, I am disposed to give full credit to the report that our loss, though only 3,521 killed, wounded, and missing, the enemy's dead alone on the field nearly equal that number, viz, 3,240. Happening at that point of the line when a flag of truce was sent in to ask permission for each party to bury its dead, I gave General Logan authority to permit a temporary truce on that flank alone, while our labors and fighting proceeded at all others. I also send you copy of General Garrard's report of the breaking of railroad toward Augusta.+ Now I am grouping my command to attack the Macon road, and with that view will intrench a strong line of circumvallation and flanks, so as to have as large an infantry column to co-operate as possible with all the cavalry to swing round to the south and east to control that road at or below East Point.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

W. T. SHERMAN,

General THOMAS:

General Garrard is back all safe, having lost but 2 men. He destroyed the bridges across the branches of the Ocmulgee, and the depots at Conveyers, Covington, and Social Circle, and brought in 200 prisoners and a fine lot of fresh horses and negroes. He is now at Decatur resting, but we must all get in motion by the day after to-morrow. I though Captain Dayton had sent you word about General Garrard's return. General Logan now foots up the killed of the enemy at 3,200, and 2,100 prisoners. Our loss in killed, wounded, and missing, 3,500 and 10 guns.

Send word to General McCook and notify him to have his and Colonel Harrison's command all ready for the big raid by daylight of day after to-morrow, and that if convenient after giving his orders, I would like to see him in person to-morrow.
