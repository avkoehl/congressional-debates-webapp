Brigadier - General BUFORD,

Commanding Second Cavalry Brigade:

GENERAL: I am directed by General Reno to instruct you as follows: You will leave one regiment of cavalry at Barnett's Ford and move on with your whole remaining force in the south side of the river up to this point, pushing out a reconnaissance in your front as far as you can. Yor wagons may be sent up on this side of the river. You will leave a strong force at the forks of the road that leads to Germanne Ford. The main portion of your force will remain on the opposite side of the river from this point, which will be so arranged as to cover our front. General Bayard with five regiments of cavalry occupies Brandy Station, five miles from the Rappahannock on the railroad toward Culpeper.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDWARD M. NEILL,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant - General.
