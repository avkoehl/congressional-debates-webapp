Reports of Brigadier General John W. Fuller, U. S. Army, commanding First Brigade, of operations February 2-3 and 9 and March 21.
HDQRS. FIRST BRIG., FIRST DIV., 17TH ARMY CORPS,February 4, 1865.

LIEUTENANT: At about 2 p.m. February 2 three regiments of my command, then forming the rear of the division, reached the swamp near Rivers' Bridge (Salkehatchie River), from which point the enemy's artillery was firing at the troops in advance of me. Soon after I was ordered by the major- general commanding the division to send one regiment into the swamp on the right or easterly side of the road, and the other two on the westerly side, to support the line already formed. This order was executed, the Twenty- seventh Ohio forming the line on the right of the road, and the Thirty- ninth Ohio and the Sixty- fourth Illinois on the left, and the regiments remained in the swamp during the afternoon. At dark at regiment on the right of the road was withdrawn, and an hour or two afterward I sen the Eighteenth Missouri to relieve the regiments on the left. This regiment (which had marched with the train during the day) remained on duty during the night- five companies deployed as skirmishers and remained held in reserve on the road. During the night some of the skirmishers constructed some rifle pits on the road near to the enemy's battery, with a view of rendering it hazardous for him to use his guns.

On the morning of the 3rd I detailed the Twenty- seventh Ohio to procure an carry lumber into the swamp, an later they were supplied with axes and ordered to cut and bridge a road leading through to the River. A squad of the regiment serving as skirmishers to cover the advance working party succeeded in crossing the main branch of the River about 1 or 2 o'clock, and came upon a pieced- post of the enemy. Soon after this was announced the skirmishers of the Third Brigade were crossed and detail of the Twenty- seventh Ohio felled some large trees across the stream to facilitate the passage of our troops.
