Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

General Canby telegraphs from New Orleans, July 2, that over 6,000 men would embark that day, and would reach Fort Monroe from the 8th to the 10th; 6,000 more would be ready as soon as transports arrived, and that the whole number to be sent will be 20,000. Ricketts' division arrived at Baltimore, and was sent forward to the Monocacy. Dismounted cavalry ordered here for remounts, but none yet arrived. General Sheridan says 2,496 of those sent are sick. If so, we shall have but 500 for the field. Hunter's army moves so slow, and the railroad is so broken up, that I fear he will be too late to give us much aid. Enemy around Maryland Heights, at Hagerstown, Boonsborough, and Middletown, and threating Frederick. Also, guerrillas at Brookeville, threatening Washington and Baltimore road. There has been considerable alarm in Washington, Baltimore, and Pennsylvania.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

Latest dispatches state that a heavy column of the enemy has crossed the Monocacy and is moving on Urbana. Sigel and Couch say that scouts, prisoners, and country people confirm previous reports of the enemy's force-that is, some 20,000 or 30,000. Until
