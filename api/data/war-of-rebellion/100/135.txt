THOMAS ROSE,Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

FAISON'S STATION, April 8, 1865.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I have received your instructions for the movement of my corps. My entire supply train is at Goldsborough. I had proposed to start with four days' rations in the haversacks. My men or eaccustomed to carry that amount, and I can do so well as not. I would suggest that the wagons to carry the five days' hard bread and three days' meat should follow the Twenty-third Army Corps to where the first pontoon bridge will be laid, then ross and meet during or at the end of my second day's march. I can send a strong regiment to the bridge to act as a trai guard. I fear there will hardly be time to load the wagons and get them here before I start. Please let me know as soon as possible whether this suggestion meets your approbation.

A. H. TERRY,

Major-General.
