THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 18,
But this is not all the negro is costing us.
W e have a Freedman's Bureau as part of the
furniture of " reconstruction." And that we
may see to what objects our money is appro-
priated through that machine, I take from the
last report of the Secretary of War ad interim
the following items:
For schools and school buildings  $553,915 79
For subsistence stores  1,460,3:35 28
For transportation of refugees, freedmcn,
teachers, and agents  227,754 63
For salaries of agents, clerks, ic  521,421 44
For medical department  331,001 21
For quarters and fuel  135,09S (54
For clothing  116,OSS 80
For printing, postage, and other contin-
gencies  251,190 86
Total S3.597.397 65
There are three and a half millions more of
money thrown away upon the negro. The
Secretary says the freedmen, as a people, are
making rapid progress in education, in me-
chanic arts, and in all branches of industry ;
and surely they ought to be, for no white men
were ever so cared for by this Government or
any other. Fed, clothed, warmed, educated,
doctored, and carried about the country at the
expense of a Government staggering under a
load of debt and actually deliberating about
compelling the public creditor to take a non-
interest-bearing promise to pay in lieu of the
interest bearing promise he holds!
Sir, my constituents build their own school-
houses and educate their own children. They
get annually a small allowance out of the State
treasury to aid the work of education, but they
never got a dollar from the Federal Govern-
ment for such a purpose. I commend to their
notice the above annual expenditure of $600j000
for the education of negro children. Now,
sir, I complain not of the education of chil-
dren, white or black. On the contrary, I re-
joice when any human intellect gains a single
ray of added illumination, but I protest against
the Federal Government engaging in this work
of educating negroes at the expense of white
men. Let the parents of colored children do
as the parents of white children—labor to edu-
cate their offspring. If we had admitted the
southern States, directly the war ended, they
might by this time have been able to lend a
helping hand to parents in this noble work of
education ; but we have so harried and perse-
cuted them with our military reconstruction
that they have been unable to attend to any
domestic interests.
Mr. Chairman, this Government was not
instituted for any of the purposes which the
Freednaen's Bureau is pursuing. It is misuse
and abuse of our powers; it is an insult to
the white race of the country; it is an intol-
erable despotism. Again, I warn bondhold-
ers and bankers not to perpetuate this outrage
by their votes. If we were out of debt, and
taxation were light, it would be a gross per-
version of public funds, this expenditure on
the standing army and the Freedmen's Bu-
reau, but in our actual circumstances it is mad-
ness.
Let no one suppose, however, that these large
expenditures are even a faint reflection of all
that reconstruction has cost us. Besides the
hundreds of millions already wasted in that
work, we have so deranged the relation of cap-
ital and labor in the South that southern plant-
ers are forced to turn farmers, and instead of
growing cotton to be manufactured in northern
looms or sent abroad in northern ships to pay
our foreign debts they betake themselves to
manufacturing and to the cultivation of cereals.
Thus we have destroyed our best market for
northern manufactures and agricultural prod-
ucts. The injurious consequences of this folly
are bat just beginning to be felt, but before we
get through the sea of troubles that encompass
us we shall find we have paid more dearly for
our whistle than ever whistle was paid for be-
fore. New England, largely profited by the
war, can afford to rest awhile upon her accumu-
lated riches; but the suspension of her manu-
factories and ship-building impairs the indus-
try of the middle Slates. < )ur agricultural prod-
ucts, which feed New England operatives, and
our coal and iron, suffer when labor languishes
in that quarter.
It has been said that whenever man attempts
to do anything great he begins by building a
fire. The pure anthracite of the great coal-
fields of Pennsylvaniais his best fuel. Whether
ships and steamboats are to be propelled;
cotton, wool, or paper manufactured ; iron
wrought into the thousand forms in which it is
made to subserve human wants; railroad trans-
portation sustained, or any other great and use-
ful work accomplished, our coal is wanted. But
to mine", prepare, and transport it to sea-board
markets require a large outlay of money which
depends for its profits upon the other industrial
pursuits of the country. Whatever depresses
these strikes a blow at our great Pennsylvania
staples. Your reconstruction policy has done
us incalculable injury in this regard. Every
mill and manufactory, every furnace and forge,
and every steamship you stop stops so much
mining of coal. We are so completely mem-
bers one of another, the ligaments of trade
hold distant communities in such intimate and
sympathetic union, that—
"Any link you strike.
Tenth or ten thousandth, breaks the chain alike."
Nor will the West fail to reap bitter fruits
from reconstruction. Hitherto paper money
has kept up the price of agricultural products,
though it has kept up also the price of all the
farmer has had to buy, but to a great extent
the depression of manufacturing labor in the
eastern States injures the markets of western
agricultural product^in the same way it touches
our coal trade. The great mischief, however,
which reconstruction is doing to the western
farmer is that it is destroying his southern
market and raisiug up rival farmers among the
growers of cotton, rice, and tobacco.
Now, sir, all this loss and suffering in the
various sections of the country, past, present,
or future, are chargeable to that unfriendly and
unwise legislation that treats southern States
as conquered provinces, that keeps them out
of the Union, that threatens confiscation, that
taunts and wounds southern sensibilities, that
forces the negro into relations and responsi-
bilities for which he is unfitted, that disfran-
chises free white American citizens. Such
legislation breaks up the relations which God
and nature established between men, dislocates
the joints of society, and cramps and cripples
the whole body-politic. No arithmetic can
compute the cost of it, no prescience can fore-
cast all its evil consequences.
The importance to us in a financial view of
a settled condition of affairs in the southern
States cannot be overrated. The vast capaci-
ties of that fertile region are all needed to pay
our debt and reduce our taxes, and if the peo-
ple could be permitted to settle their internal
political affairs and to regulate their industry
without interference from us its contributions
to the national wealth would soon become what
they were before the war. In 1859 the whole
export trade of the country was $278,392,080,
of which the productions furnished by the
southern States amounted to $188,693,496.
And even for the year 1867,'notwithstand-
ing all the embarrassments we have imposed
upon the southern industry, the exports of its
products—including northern products shipped
from Baltimore and New Orleans—amounted
to sixty-nine per cent, of our whole export
trade. If a liberal deduction were made for
northern products shipped from those ports,
southern productions furnished for the year
1867 full one half of the exports of the coun-
try.
I have obtained from the bureau of statistics
a table of the exports of cotton from the Uni-
ted States for the past twelve years, which I
introduce as an instructive document bearing
directly upon the financial questions of the
day.

See, sir, how quickly the war brought down
the production of cotton from 1,707,686,338
pounds in 1860, valued at $191,806,555, to less
than 400,000,000 pounds in 1861, producing
less than $35,000,000. And observe how, in
1866, the first year after the war, the produc-
tion went up again to more than 650,000,000
pounds, a crop which, though greatly less in
bulk than that of 1860, sold for more money, in
consequence of the high price to which cotton
had advanced during the war. In 1867, though
there was increase in quantity over the produc-
tion of 1866, it sold for less money, because the
price had declined in the Liverpool market,
which is the great cotton market of the world.
I am assured on the best authority that the
cotton crops of 1866 and 1867 have not quit
cost, and that every northern capitalist who has
invested in cotton plantations has suffered dis-
appointment and loss. This has resulted from
the disorganized condition of labor in the South,
from the high rates of interest for money, equal
in some instances to three and four per cent, a
month, from the cotton tax, and from the pro-
tective tariff. From these causes, most of
which belong to reconstruction, we have man-
aged to render worthless the great staple which
that region is so willing and ready to produce.
We keep down its production to the lowest
point to which we can repress it, and then we
makethatcost us.more than it returns tous, so
i that raising cotton under reconstructive legis-
S lation, instead of helping to pay our debt, is
really increasing it and impoverishing the
country.
Do gentlemen imagine that the people of the
North, East, and West are going to long endure
this unnatural state of things? Will they not
soon say, in a voice of thunder, that, seeing
how grievously we are oppressed with taxes,
we ought to have, and will have, the rich con-
tributions to our financial resources which the
excluded States are capable of yielding? That
voice will come booming over the Ilocky and
Alleghany mountains; it will swell up from the
valleys of the Mississippi, the Ohio, and the
Susquehanna; it will come riding on the blasts
from the North and the East; and gentlemen
whose nerves are now disturbed by what they
call "screechings" for the Constitution, will
be more startled to hear that this trifling with
the great interests of the nation must stop—
that vociferous speeches about treason and
Sumter, well enough when men had to be stim-
ulated to fratricidal slaughter, will not serve
our purpose in these days of debts and taxes,
when we need all the resources of all the States—
that the negro, a fit object of our sympathies
and our care, is unfit for political partnership
with the white man—in a word, that this sham
called reconstruction and all its artificers and
engineers are dismissed to the oblivion that
shall be eternal. When that day of truth-tell-
ing comes the disguises of the hour, and that
have served so good a partisan purpose in the
dreary years of war and reconstruction, will be'
torn off and rent into atoms. The people, no,
longer blinded by pretenses of excessive loyalty
and patriotism, will see that the war, fought by
