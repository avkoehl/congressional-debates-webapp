HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, Port Royal, July 11, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington:

SIR: I most earnestly beg that by return of mail you will give me full authority to muster into the service of the United States, as infantry, all loyal men to be found in my department, and that I be authorized to appoint all the officers. This has now become a military necessity in this department. I send by General Stevens to Fort Monore six regiments, and will send four more as soon as transportation arrives. If affairs in the mean time should take such a turn as to render the sending of these four additional regiments unnecessary please notify me at once. Send sufficient transportation if they are needed. I have to abandon Edisto and possibly beaufort.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

D. HUNTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
