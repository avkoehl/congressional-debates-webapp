NASHVILLE, November 25, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Columbia:

Major-General Halleck dispatches me from Washington the follows:

Dispatches from Hilton Head indicate that General Sherman has captured Macon and Milledgeville, and that Beauregard has been recalled from Tennessee, to fall on Sherman's rear. This is also indicated through Beauregard's proclamation to the people of Georgia, sent from Corinth through Selma, to rise en masse, obstruct the roads in Sherman's front, flank, and rear; waylay and shoot down his foragers and stragglers; and that he soon would he with them to help them out of their dilemma.

If this be true there will be indications of it in a day or so.

General Johnson has directed this party, one officer and fifty men, to remain where they are for the present. No sign of the enemy as far as they went.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
