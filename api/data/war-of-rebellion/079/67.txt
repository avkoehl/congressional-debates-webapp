(Received 8 p. m.)

General STANLEY:

To-morrow I will concentrate the whole army at Kenesaw and move upon the enemy wherever he may be. Howard is here and Cox is at the river. Instruct Elliot, if you can communicate whit him, to harass as much as possible the corps burning the railroad, and build fires as indications of a large force about Kenesaw. Hood left a considerable force down about Campbellton, and has with him doubtess the best part of his three corps. Howard and Davis will come up on the Marietta and Sandtown road.

General STANLEY:

Make a feint on Pine Mountain in the morning with a view to prevent an attack on Allatoona, which I wish to avoid. My opinion is they don't want to fight, but want to interrupt our communication.

General SHERMAN,

Smyrna Camp-Ground:

I think that the mass of the rebel army is north of the line from this to Pine Top. I think I can go there without much opposition. I ordered General Davis to-day to come up on my left to the position opposite the one from which he assaulted on the 27th of June, but he was not within two miles of this an hour after dark. I have been givin him orders. In this in accordnace with your wishes, or will you give them direct?

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.

SMYRNA, October 4, 1864.

General STANLEY:

I ordered General Davis to-day to move up no your left, connecting with you. I suppose it will require an order from me to put both corps under your command. I will be up in the morning early and will make the necessary orders; in the mean time General Davis will execute his orders and act in concert with you. Howard will come up on his left,
