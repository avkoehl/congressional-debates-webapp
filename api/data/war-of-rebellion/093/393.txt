during the forenoon of the 28th, changed the front of our works; some skirmishing during the day between our pickets and those of the enemy on the opposite bank of the river. Pontoon and railroad bridges were also burned on that day. At 10 a.m. of the 29th of November Lieutenant R. H. Mason and twenty men of Company A started with dispatches from General Schofield to the commanding officers post of Williamsport, distant about nineteen miles. He accomplished his errand successfully, passing several parties of rebels during the journey, and returning to his command at Nashville on the 1st of December, without losing a single man. At noon on the 29th ultimo the regiment, with the balance of the brigade, abandoned their works at the river and moved across to the Franklin pike; thence took up their line of march to Franklin. Just before dark, when within three miles of Spring Hill, the brigade passed the wagon train, already halted, and filed to the right of the road. Two companies of this regiment were deployed as skirmishers, the regiment moving forward as their support, forming the right of the advance line of the brigade; constant skirmishing until within half a mile of Spring Hill, when the brigade halted; the skirmishers having moved too far to the right, lost the support of the regiment. In this skirmish the regiment had 4 men wounded. At about 10 a.m. the brigade resumed its march through Spring Hill and halted about 1.30 a.m. and rested until 3 a.m. of the 30th, at which time the march was again resumed. At about 7 a.m. reached Franklin, the brigade taking position on the right of the road and commenced fortifying the left of the Fiftieth Ohio resting on the Franklin pike, the Seventy-second Illinois being on the right of the Fiftieth Ohio. Were at work on the fortifications at the time the enemy made their first assault. About 4 p.m. two divisions of the Fourth Corps, being in front of the works gave way on the approach of the enemy and rushed pell-mell into our works. At the same time the support on our left gave way, and the flank of our regiment being turned, the four left companies fell back, and as our right flank also became exposed to the enemy, the remaining companies were also ordered to retire to the second line of works, which was done. At that time, all of our field officers being wounded, I, being the senior captain, took command of the regiment, and a charge was ordered to recover our first position. In the charge all of our color guard, consisting of 1 sergeant and 8 corporals were shot down, and the night being so dark it was not perceived that our colors, which had been shot to shreds, were missing. An attempt was made to regain the colors, which was unsuccessful. The regiment was ordered to retire by Colonel Strickland, commanding brigade at about midnight. The regiment then crossed the Harpeth River, and the next morning joined the brigade while on the march to Nashville, at which place we arrived about 3 p.m. on the 1st instant, and camped near Fort Negley. The regiment remained in camp until the 2nd instant, when it was assigned to the corps commanded by General A. J. Smith.

The regiment lost in killed, wounded, and missing during the time which we belonged to the brigade, 9 officers and 142 enlisted men. I append a list of casualties.*

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. SEXTON,

Captain, Seventy-second Illinois Volunteer, Commanding Regiment.

Lieutenant JOHN B. McLOE,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, 3rd Brigadier, 23rd Army Corps.
