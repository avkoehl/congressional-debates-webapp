The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was in section [six]

"but the legislature shall have no right to
abridge or limit the right of suffrage."
The amendment wag agreed to.
The next amendment was in section [nine]

jects" the words 11 territorial and municipal,"
and after the word "than" to insert "two
dollars;" so as to read:

be liable to a higher tax in any one year, for all gen-
eral objects, than two dollars on every t>100 of tlio
cash value thereof.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was in line twelve of
the section, to strike out the word "territorial "
before " governmentand at the end of the
section to insert "but said debt in no ease to
exceed $1,000,000;" soastoread:
Nor shall said government liave power to borrow
money or issue stock or bonds for any object what-
ever, unless specially authorized by an act of the
legislative assembly passed by a voto of two thirds
of the members of each branch thereof; but said
debt in no case to exceed SI,out),000.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. BAYARD. In line fifteen of the section
under consideration I would submit an amend-
ment to insert after the words "two thirds"
the words "of the entire number of the mem-
bers of each branch thereof." This is as to
the power of this council to borrow money.
Here it is by a vote of two thirds. I ask that
it shall be so amended as to read, "two thirds
of the entire number of the members of each
branch."
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate
is now considering amendments reported by
the Committee on the District of Columbia.
They are first in order.
Mr. BAYARD. I do not wish to embarrass
the progress of the bill, but I thought probably,
as we were passing over this section, it might
be as well to move the amendment.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Sen-
ator in charge of the bill does not object the
Chair will entertain the amendment and put
the question. The question is on the amend-
ment proposed by the Senator from Delaware.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. HAMLIN. The word "or" in section
ten, line four, at the end of the line, after the
word "lands," ought to be inserted, so as to
read "lands or other property."
The PRESIDING OFFICER. That cor-
rection will be made, if there be no objection.
The reading of the amendments reported by
the Committee on the District of Columbia
will be proceeded with.
The Chief Clerk. The next amendment
reported by the committee is in section ten,
now made section eleven, line two, after the
word " shall" to strike out " have power to ;"
and inline four to insert the words "not exceed-
ing three" after "townships;" and to strike
out the word "to" after "and;" so that the
section, if amended, will read :
That the legislative assembly shall divide that
portion of the District not included in the corporate
limits of Washington or Georgetown into townships,
not exceeding three, ar.d create township oiiiees, and
prescribe the duties thereof; butailtownship officers
shall bo olected by the people of the townships,
respectively.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was in section [thir-
teen] fourteen, line five, after the word " Con-
gress," to insert " or from other sources ;" so

bly to maintain a system of free schools for the edu-
cation of the youth of said District; and all moneys
raised by general taxation orarising from donations
by Congress or from other sources for school purposes
shall bo appiopriated for the equal benefit of all
the youth of said District between certain ages to be
defined by law.
Mr. HAMLIN. I want to add after the word
" sources" the words " except by gift or de-
vise because if any gentleman should devise
a sum of money and specify precisely how it
should go, it should not go into the general
fund.
The amendment to the amendment was
agreed to.

The next amendment was in section [seven-
teen] eighteen, to strike out the following words
at the end of the section:

town, or either of them, bo repealed, which they
shall not be without tho consent of the citizens
thereof, or so modified as to take away the power of
taxation, the said legislative assembly shall have
power to levy a special tax upon property within
such corporation for tho payment of tho debts
thereof, and lor no other purpose.
And in lieu thereof to insert:
That tlio charters of tho corporations of Washing-
ton and Georgetown shall not be repealed without
a voto of a majority of tho legal voters of tho said
cities of Washington and Georgetown, respectively,
at a lepcal meeting called for that purpose. And in
ease of the repeal or modification of the charters
aforesaid, or oitlior of them, the said legislative as-
sembly shall havo power to levy a special tax upon
property within such corporation for the payment
of the debts thereof, and for no other purpose.
Mr. HAMLIN. The word "given" should
be inserted after the word "respectively," in
line twenty-one ; so as to read, "respectively
given at a legal meeting."
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Mou-
rill, of Maine, in the chair.) That modifica-
tion will be made. The question is on the
amendment as modified.

The next amendment was in section [twenty-
one] twenty-two, to fill the blank in the second
line with "$3,000;" so as to read, "that the
Governor shall receive an annual salary of
S3,000."
Mr. FOAVLEB,. I suggest $4,000. I think
$3,000 rather a small salary for a Governor of
the District of Columbia.
Mr. HAMLIN. 1 do not object to that.
Mr. COLE. I inquire of the chairman of
the committee, or the Senator fromTennessee,
how much the salaries of Governors of Terri-
tories is as a rule?
Mr. HAMLIN. Thirty-five hundred dol-
lars; but this proposed Governor of the Dis-
trict here would be obliged to maintain a little
more social relations. I think on the whole
$4,000 is not an improper sum.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was in line three of the
section, to fill the blank with $2,500, so as to
make the salary of the Secretary of the Dis-
trict $2,500.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was in line twenty-five,
to fill the blank with $0,000; so as to read:
There shall be appropriated annually by Congress
a sufficient sum, to be expended by the Governor, to
defray the contingent expenses of the District, in-
cluding the salary of a clork of the executive depart-
ment, not exceeding ยง5,000 per annum.
The amendment was agreed to-

three] twenty-four, at the end of the eighteenth
line, to strike out the word "that" and insert
"and."
The VICE PRESIDENT. This verbal
amendment will be considered as agreed to.
The next amendment was in section [twenty-
four] twenty-five, line six, to strike out the
word "with" after the word intrusted, and

five] twenty-six, after the word "represent-
atives" to insert " appoint a board of registra-
tion ; " so that the section will read :

cress held after such valuation shall betaken; and
if valuations of said District shall be taken ol'tener.

Mr. FOWLER. 1 now move, in section seven,
line six, that these words he stricken oat:
" and such as shall have voluntarily aided the
late rebellion," so as to place the suffrage here
upon the ground of the reconstruction meas-
ures that have been adopted. I know of but
one State in which tins principle of exclusion
is retained ; that is Missouri.
Mr. BAYARD. I hope that amendment
will prevail. This is only a municipal elec-
tion.
Mr. HAIILAN. How will the section read,
if amended ?
The ChiefCleiuc. "That all male citizens
of the United States above the age of twenty-
one years, who shall have been actual resi-
dents of said District for twelve months prior
to the first election, except such as are non
compos mentis and persons convicted of in-
famous crimes, shall bo entitled to vote at said
election/'
