Major-General WOOD,

Commanding Third Division, Greeneville, East Tenn.:

Send one brigade of your division immediately to Warm Springs. Let them take five days' rations, and give orders to the brigade commander to hold himself in readiness to support Colonel Kirby, who has gone to Asheville. The orderlies left by Major Steele know the route. Let the brigade take the road he came and move as soon as it can get ready. From information received by Colonel Kirby since he left we learn there is more force there than at first anticipated, and he may become involved so as to need assistance.

By command of Major-General Stanley:

WM. H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

COLONEL: You will move with your brigade without delay to Warm Springs, halting there in a good position and holding your command in readiness to support Colonel Kirby, who has gone to Asheville. Take with you six days' rations, three in haversacks and three in wagons, and three wagon loads of ammunition, say 45,000 rounds. Call on the quartermaster, commissary, and ordnance officer of the division for the necessary transportation and supplies. Four orderlies who came over the road yesterday from Warm Springs will conduct your command. After reaching Warm Springs open, if possible, communication with Colonel Kirby.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

TH. J. WOOD,

Major-General of Volunteers.
