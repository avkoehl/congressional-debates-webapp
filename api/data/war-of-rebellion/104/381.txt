Brigadier General DAVIS TILLSON,

Greeneville, East Tenn.:

(To be forwarded.)

On receipt of this make disposition of your force so as to hold East Tennessee against roving bands of guerrillas. General Stanley has been ordered to this place with his corps. Communicate with General Stoneman as soon as you can, and inform him that I wish him to dispose his entire force to the best advantage to preserve order in East Tennessee and Western North Carolina and to put down guerrillas, as in a short time there will be no formidable force east of the Savannah River. We have Selma and Mobile.
