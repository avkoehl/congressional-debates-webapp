POOLESVILLE, MD., March 1, 1862.

Major-General BANKS,

Harper's Feery:

The enemy unusually demonstrative on their line of pickets to-day, exhibiting both infantry and cavalry, also six baggage wagons opposite Moson's Island. They shelled us from their position opposite Edwards Ferry and at Ball's Bluff this afternoon, but discontinued as soon as we replied. There were smokes in their camps. These demonstrations may be for a blind, but I am unable to assert it positively.

N. J. T. DANA,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, Washington, March 2, 1862.

S. F. BARSTOW,Assistant Adjutant-General, Camp Chase, Paw Paw:

During the illness of General Lander let the next officer in rank assume command and move the available troops on Martinsburg via Hedgesville, covering construction of roads as troops advance. General Williams will be in Martinsburg with some 5,000 men. It is desirable to have the troops of General Lander's command in Martinsburg with least possible delay. Sufficient guards must be left to cover the railroad.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
