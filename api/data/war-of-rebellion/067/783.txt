of killed and wounded, 60 or 70 prisoners captured. I have had troops on the left of General Warren's corps all day, and connected with him. I have now ordered a strong force down the Mechanicsville road to go down as far as General Warren and connect with his command.

I inclose extracts from Richmond paper of this date. My headquarters will be at Sayers' house to-night.

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,Cold Harbor, May 31, 1864.

GENERAL: All the indications to-day lead to the belief that the enemy meditated an attack on the First Division of cavalry posted 1 1\2 miles from Cold Harbor, so I gave permission to General Torbert to attack them. He did so, encountering Fitz. Lee's division of cavalry them from their barricades in Cold Harbor, and capturing about half a regiment and 15 of Clingman's infantry. Since then the second brigade, of Hoke's division, has arrived. I do not feel able to hold this place, and have directed General Torbert to resume his position of this morning. Lee's line of battle is in front of Mechanicsville, and, with the heavy odds against me here, I do not Gaines' Hill, to cover the bridges across the Chickahominy.

The First Division behaved very gallantly. The wounded are all being sent to the rear. We will have 70 or 80.

Very respectfully,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

GENERAL: In obedience to your instructions I am holding Cold Harbor. I have captured this morning more prisoners; they belong to three different infantry brigades. The enemy assaulted the right of my lines this morning, but were handsomely repulsed. I have been very apprehensive, but General Wright is now coming up. I built slight works for my men. The enemy came up to them and were driven back. General Wright has just arrived.
