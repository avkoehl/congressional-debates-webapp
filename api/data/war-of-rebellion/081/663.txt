Brigadier General G. W. C. Lee,

Commanding Richmond Defenses:

GENERAL: Will you be so good as to let me know, if yourself informed, where the Whitworth gun is, with the detachment serving it? The gun was, you remember, near Bottom's Bridge. Can you also inform me where the two battalions of artillery are now stationed which were on Monday in position between Crouch's and Bottom's Bridge, viz, Lieutenant-Colonel Lightfoot's and the Washington Artillery?

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAFFIN'S FARM, June 17, 1864.

General W. N. Pendleton,

Chief of Artillery, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: When I left Bottom's Bridge the Whitworth gun was near Savage Station, York River Railroad. Colonel Lightfoot's and Colonel Eshleman's battalions of artillery were stationed at the fords from Fisher's to Crouch's, both inclusive. I think one battalion there would be sufficient, although I do know what is the state of affairs
