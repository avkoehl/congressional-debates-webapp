HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 25, 1863-11. 30 a. m.

Major-General REYNOLDS, Edwards Ferry:

Directions have been given for General Stahel to report to you with his command. Please send him in advance, in the direction of Frederick and Gettysburg, and drive from that country every rebel in it. His operations must extend from the South Mountain to the east as far as he finds rebels; to report to you as often as necessary to a full knowledge of the enemy's movements.

HOOKER,

Major-General.

Brigadier-General HOWE, Commanding Division, Bristoe Station:

The major-general commanding directs that you remain with your division at Bristoe until 7 p. m., instead of moving at 2 p. m., as by previous order from General Sedgwick. Notice of the change will be given General Sedgwick.

S. F. BARSTOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

EDWARDS FERRY, VA.,

June 25, 1863-11. 30 a. m.

Major-General HOOKER:

I reached here about 11. 45, and found the Eleventh Corps still crossing the bridge, though the rear of it is now about over. They have an immense number of led horses and colts, evidently stolen, blocking up the roads and bridges. Stahel has pushed on toward Crampton's Pass. I have sent Howard orders to send the brigade to Stahel, as neither Birney nor my corps will be able to reach him to-day. I think you should be here as early as possible. My instructions have not overtaken me yet. Telegraph me at Poolesville, or here, for the next hour.

JOHN F. REYNOLDS,

Major-General.

Major-General REYNOLDS, Edwards Ferry:

Your telegram is just received. Will be at Poolesville at 9 a. m. to-morrow. Your instructions should have reached you long ago.
