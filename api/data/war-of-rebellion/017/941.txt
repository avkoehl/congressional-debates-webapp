as we had not motive power enough to haul all the cars at once. Leaving this last train, I myself left on horseback about 2 o'clock, I think; I will not be positive, but it will not vary much from 2 o'clock in the morning.

Question. How many cars were attached to the locomotive that came up last, after you left?

Answer. Twelve or fourteen cars; I will not be positive which.

Question. Do you know when that last train reached its destination?

Answer. It must have been near 4 o'clock in the morning, according to my estimation; I was not at the point where they did arrive, being perhaps a quarter or a half a mile off the track; but it was about 4 o'clock in the morning, I should judge.

Question. Where did you go after leaving the trains?

Answer. I attempted to go to Bristoe Station, but did not reach there until after daylight in the morning, having lost my way in connection with the party I was with.

Question. How did you travel?

Answer. On horseback.
