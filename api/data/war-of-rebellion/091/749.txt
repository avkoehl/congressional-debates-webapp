BERLIN, December 6, 1864.

Brigadier General JOHN D. STEVENSON:

Information from various sources, each not cognizant of the other, satisfies me that Mosby, with 300 men, was to-day at Dry Mills, two miles and a half westward from Leesburg. He has Lieutenants Graham and Rhodes, of Keyes' cavalry, and several prisoners from General Merritt's command. He has informed citizens that he intends to hang Lieutenant Graham as a deserter from C. S. Army. Graham's term of service was out before his term of service, one year, had expired. You may rely upon this information as correct. Cannot something be done to take Mosby's command? Corporal treetop, who took French Bill, shot one of Mosby's men yesterday; he died this morning at Lovettsville. He is out again after more.

D. HENRY BURTNETE,

Captain and Assistant Provost-Marshal.

MONOCACY, December 6, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

Is there any truth in report that Mosby is on the railroad?

J. I. YELLOTT.
