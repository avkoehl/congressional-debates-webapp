Waring at Lebanon, Colonel Mills at Springfield, and Lieutenant-Colonel Holland at Cassville.

To do justice to all I would spread before you the most of the rolls of this army, for I can bear testimony to the almost universal good conduct of officers and men who have shared with me the long march, the many conflicts by the way, and final struggle with the combined forces of Price, McCulloch, McIntosh, and Pike, under Major-General Van Dorn, at the battle of Pea Ridge.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis, Mo.
