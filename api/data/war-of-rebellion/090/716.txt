FORT PENDLETON, MD., August 6, 1864.

General KELLEY,

Cumberland, Md.:

GENERAL: Since my last letter I have constantly had scouting parties out in the direction of Greenfland Gap. Sometimes things looked gloomy enough. The country people on the east side of the Alleghany were very much excited, but as yet nothing of importance has occurred. On last Thursday my scouts pursued three of McNeill's men form the Junction to Elk Garden, but were unable to bring them to a halt. On Tuesday two men came to my camp representing themselves to be Captain Yocum's men, and had his pass. They said they were in pursuit of a horse-thief. They were truly suspicious in appearance. I send them under arrest to New Creek. I was under the impression from their actions and manner generally that they were spies, but they proved to be all right. My scouts to-day fell in with a detachment of the Ringgold Cavalry not far from Foley. All is quiet to-day as far as the gap. I shall continue to be vigilant, and if attacked I will do the best I can to hold my position.

I am, general, very respectfully, yours,

GODWIN,

Captain.
