Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The application for authority to send General McCook with Congressional committee to the plans was made in view of his own wishes expressed to me at Helena. He writes me that his brother in opposing it was entirely mistaken, and he desires very much to go. He is the best officer I know for this service, and I again ask authority to send him.
