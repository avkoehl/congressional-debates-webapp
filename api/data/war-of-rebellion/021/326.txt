duty performed by me during the operations of the Army of the Gulf upon the Bayou Teche, Western Louisiana, in the month of April, 1863. On the 8th of April, 1863, I was ordered to Brashear City by Captain W. W. Rowley, acting chief signal officer.

On the 9th of April, 1863, I reported to Brigadier-General Weitzel, upon the gunboat Calhoun, whence I communicated with Second Lieutenant F. D. Butterfield, acting signal officer (upon the depot of the Opelousas Railroad at Brashear City), and Second Lieutenant John W. Dana, acting signal officer, stationed on the gunboat Clifton.

The Calhoun immediately crossed Berwick Bay to Berwick City. While on the passage I sent the following messages:

To Lieutenant Butterfield.

All right.

WEITZEL.

To Lieutenant Dana.

Follow with the Laurel Hill.

WEITZEL.

To Lieutenant Buttefield.

Hurry up the Clifton and Laurel Hill.

WEITZEL.

The troops disembarked at Berwick City, whence I comminuted with Lieutenant Butterfield, acting signal officer, across Berwick Bay, the distance between the stations being nearly a mile.

To General Weitzel.

Detach a company of cavalry to return here and report to General Grover.

R. B. IRWIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

To Colonel Irwin.

Have no cavalry here.

WEITZEL.

To General Witzel.

Send it back as soon as it returns.

R. B. IRWIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

To Colonel Irwin.

What does it mean?

WEITZEL.

To General Weitzel.

Cavalry; but it has reported.

R. B. IRWIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

To General Weitzel.

Send Clifton over if possible.

R. B. IRWIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
