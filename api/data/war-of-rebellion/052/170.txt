Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

General Morton's place, in command [of the pioneers*], should be filled+by an engineer officer of [some rank and*] experience. Captain Merrill, having charge of the topographical department, cannot attend to it, and Lieutenant Burroughs is too young. It is of very great importance to us now. Can't you send me one who can manage a pontoon?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
