Mr President /When I presen ed ihe reso'u-
tien, (now before-the Senate,) merely designating
the time for proceeding to the election of a public
Printer, little indeed did I suppose tnat it would
meet with any opposition I knew well Ihe exist-
ing statutory provision upon the subject I knew
well what had been the uniform, the invariable,
practice of this body wnh reference to this matter
I knew well the history connected with ihe intro-
duction and the passage of toe resolution of
March 1819, and, wnh a knowledge of these
facts, I could not have anticipated ihi slightest ob
jeclion to the adoption of the resuluticn row before
us but so it l^ The Senator from Connecicut,
at this late day, interpon his objections to the
Senate proceeding to the election H denu s tint
the joint resolutions of 1819 in 1 of lb29 were oh'i-
gatory in their character, o-w rt, in ace rdancewiti
the provis on of Ihp Cons ítution which secures to
this and to the other House ihe n¿ht to choose
their own officers He denies ihat there is any
necessity, or that mere would be any expediency,
in proceeding to the elect on at th s time I pjr
pose to notice these objec u ns The S nator, in
the course of his iermrk% observed lhat the Senate
which would assemble hereon th fourth of Maich
would be competent t > ckct their own printer.
And has ihat fact any thing 'o do .vith the ques
lion? Have I denied the competency o the abili
ty of that Senate? Have I u tered one word
in disparagement of that bodj' No, sir. And
why the Senator has alluded to that matter
I am unable to comprehend II the obligation
rests upon this Senate, under the resolutions of
1819 and 1829, to elect a Printer to execute the
public piloting for the next Congress, we sh ul 1
not hesitate to meet and to penorm tne obligation
—if no uch ob iga'ion is imp sed upon it, the next
Senate will htve t > perform that duly The Sena
tor remarked that die mover (i'ludmg e m/self) rf
the resolution wo^ld not b° a member of the next
Senate, and that he could have no pirticular mte-
est m Ihe question whether an election of Printer
were to take place now or then mast be matter of
no moment to him Sir, it is true that I shall not be
a member of the next Senate, an I why the Sena-
tor from Connecticut has taken occasion to aliude
to the fact, I cinni t vied understand What
earthly connecfon has it v.nh the question pending
before the Senate? I the Senator supp ses that I
have brougnt forward th s re«olu ion tor th° pur-
pose of enabling me to g atify any feeling oí re-

quainted with me *f he thinks thus I exuld not

No, sir I have biought forward the resolut on
because I regarded it as the imperative duty ot ihe
Senate under the laws of Congress now to act upon
the subject—to elect a Panter before the close of the
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
session to execute the pub'ic printing for the next
Congress
This, and this alone, has nduced me to offer the
resolution before us Those charged with the
execution of the public printing at this time and
their predecessors have alike, since I S>ave been in
Congr*ss, treated me with civility I bpar towards
none ot them any ill will whatever. The Senator
has alluded to ihe present state of popular senti-
ment, and said that it would be an outrage upon that
feeling to have a Printer for the Senate whose po-
litical principles were not in accordance with tao«e
of the majority of the body And henc1 he infers
that no election should be naJe until t> e organiza-
tion of the new Senate. My answer to this is, that
we are boand to execute the law, and that neither
the Senator nor myself have at any time witnessed
such an indication of popu ar sentiment as would
go to nullify the provisions of existing statutes.
True, the political character of this boc'y will in a
short time be changed, and those now in the mino-
rity will become the majority of the body True
it is that the recent elec ion of the country has put
out thib, and will put in an ither Administration
But does it follow necessarily that hfeaf'er 'he
law is to be abrogated? Is tint to be the policy of
the coming-in Administration? Are the clear and
positive enactments of Congress to be put at defi
anee? Is there hereafter to be a ptac ical di>
regard of the injunctions of statutory )a#? The
Senator is doing great injustice to Ihe virtue
and intelligence of the coun ry to infer from the
result of reeent elections that any such feeling or
sentiment has been made manifest Far otherwise the
people know the aet> and enactmen s of ihe.r pub-
lic servants They know their ti-nor th ir force
They acknowledge their obligation, ind submit to
their direction They would no', if th?y coa'd,
make the slightest movement to set at nougnt
ihe authority of Congress No, sir, there has
been no such indicati n of public sentiment,
so far from it, th" predominant fe 'ung run-
ning through this country is respect for, and
submission to, public law ard to public autho
rity The Senator has said ma' he did not regard
the resolutions of 1819 and of 1829 as obligatory
upon him, and he give notice that he wu'd h m-
self, s oull the S'na'e row proceed t) an elec
lion of printer ursler ihose resolati ns, on theoiga-
nization of the new S na ", move ti proccd to an

ings Sir, let it be doie, and it done it will be
done upon the responsibility of the Senate and
his friends Let it bj done, an 1 let ihe country
know why and wherefore it «ras done And, sir,
I greatly misjudge if the S°na or would not find an

a p oceedmg, e line!/ diff rent from what 1 e anti-

act, which, if done, cannot fail to ca'l dovn upon
i s authors popular indignation I ihmk the Sena-
tor will take no part in any such preccedin-
Mr President Ii may be well for us lo look in o
the history of the legislation ot Con re0o in relation
to this matter We cannot fail to receive much
valuable information from such a reiro pect An-
tenoi to 1819 there was no Pub'ic Printer elected
by the two Houses of C ngiess Th  printing was
d ne by contia"!s, u ider the supervision of the &e
rie'ary of the Sena'  and of ihe Clerk of thp House
The=e contracts were almost universplly, from the
ooTrneneement of the Government to 1819, exe-
cuted by persons who were the lowest bidders for
the work The persons employed weie tie mcre
dgenls of the Houses to execute the pr nting for
Congress in accordance with their bids, a^ under
the supervision ot known officers of Congre s
It may be said, with tiuth, ihat anterior to 1819,
Ihe public pnntng was aH matter of contract
There were, then, f r the first th rty vearo of ojr
exis ence under out Con<¡titu ion, no such officers
kno^n ¡o (he Government as Puol c Prmteis
Putiiig tnat time th" Sena e had i's Secretary,
Us Se'geant a' Arms, its Doork eper and the
House had its Speskei, its Sereeant-at-^rms, and
its Doorkeeper—officers known and acknowledged
but tne idea oi a Printer to execute the print ng of
Congreso being an officer of Congress, was. never en-
tertained by any one previous to 1819, nor subse-
qienttoihatpeuoduntil 1833 or 1835,as far asi have
b°er> able to ascertain from our legislative history.
No, sir—before 1819 they were, and subsequent to
1819 they should be, regarded only as the agents of
Congress, to execute, agreeably to the provisions of
existing law, the public printing It may be just as
well said, that the prmtei employed to do the work
for any branch of the Executive Department of
our Government is thereby attached lo and made
an afficer of that branch, as to say ihat the person
empkyed to execute the printing of the legislative
branch of ttr Government is an officer of that
branch
But, sir, what was me necessity for the joint reso-
lution cf 1819—and whence did it originate' On the
fourth oí December, 1818, Mr Wilson, then a
memb°r of the Senate from the State of New Jer-
sey, introduced into Ihe Senate the following reso-
lution
"Resolved, That a joint committee of the two Houses of
Congress be appointed to consider and report whether any,
and if any what further provisions bylaw are necessary to
insure despatch, accuracy, and neatness in the printing done
by order of the two Houses tespeciively, and they have leave
to report by bill "
This resolution passed the Senate, and was, on
He 8th of the same monih, agreed to on the part of
the House with an amendment Previously Con-
gress had experienced much embarrassment in
procuring the printing to be executed. It was
neither done with despatch, with neatuess,nor with
accuracy, and the history of the times shows tnat
there was great complaint, and the action of the
two Houses in 1819, upon the reso'ution, shows
tint they considered it necessary and proper to
make ■* change m the mode then in exis ence for
procuring the public priming to be done There
was tien no doubt expressed as to the power ot
Congress to regulate this whole matter There was
then no intimation that, by the adoption of some
r-eneral regulation louchmg this subject, Congress
wouli ke encroac^i! ;; upon ths lights of others
There was then no opinion avowed that one Con-
gress could not prescribe the mode and manner of
exe"uting the pubbc printing, which m ght be re-
quire 1 by future Congresses, ihat one Congress
could not designate and appoint a printer to exe-
cute the public printing, agreeably to ihe provisions
of existing law, for the nex* succeeding Congress
These mighty discoveries have been made recently,
in more modern days The committee on the part
of th  Senate to consider the resolution above re-
furre I to, consts'ed of the mover, Mr. Wilson of
New Jersey, Mr Lacock of Pennsylvania, and
Mr Burrnl of Rhode Is'and, and oatrepartot
the House, by M>\ Pitkin of Connesticut, Mr
Rigers ©f Pennsylvania, and Mr. Lit le of Mary-
land
The character of that joint committee is a suffi-
cient guar1 v tee lhat they would not presume to report
upon a subj°ct which was not clearly within their
jurisdiction. The distingu sbed character of the
cha rman on ihe part ot the House must be known
to tae Senator from Connecticut. And I would
so ner dis rust my own judgment, than for a mo-
ment to believe that such men ss Pitkin and Bur-
nll would recommend the adoption of a measure
unwarranted by the Cocsntu ion. Sir, such an
idea would have, at that time, b en treated with
ridicule I' would have been regarded a* prepos-
terous, ihat Congress could not, by law, prescribe
the mod~ of executing the public printing to be
done thereafler, and the prices to be paid therefor,
and tnat they could not have appointed an agent to
execute that work for the ensuing Congress It
does not seem, evtn at this day, to be qaestioned
but that the Congress of 1819 had the power to
prescribe in  mode and manner for executing all
the public printing, and for fixing the rate of com-
pensation, for it ,s now said that, although all this
was rightfully done, yet it was rot m the power rf
that Congress, to appoint an agent—a printer for
executing the panting for thj then next Congress,
tint thf exercise of such a powr was unauthorized
by the Corstitulion, and in violation of the rights
of the subsequent C n^ress
