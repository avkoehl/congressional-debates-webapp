Major-General SHERMAN,

Atlanta, Ga.:

General Washburn telegraphs that Price, Marmaduke, and Shelby are preparing a raid against Missouri of 10,000 or 12,000 mounted troops. I have directed General A. J. Smith to halt at Cairo for further orders. If you can spare Smith, and Washburn's story proves true, I think Smith's force should be sent against Price. Please answer.
