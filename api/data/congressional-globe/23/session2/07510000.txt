KECEIPTS Af.D EXPEfiDITURES OF THE
GOVERNMENT.
The following resolution was submitted by'Mr.
BENTON, which was read and ordered to be
printed
Resotved, That the President be requested to
caube information to I e laid before the Senate, at I  amount of the reduction.
vided by the six'h section of the act of the 2d of
March, 1833, entitled " An act to mooify the act
of the Hlh of July, 1832, and all other acts im-
posing duties on imports," ran be reduced or re-
pealed consistently with a due regard to the manu-
facturing interest, and an estimate oí the probable
the commencement of the next bession of Con-
gress, on the following points
1    1 he ami unt of revenue which may be re-
duced on dutiable articles without affecting the
protection intended to be continued by the act of
March 2, 18:13, to domestic manufactures
2   The ainoun* of net revenue which will prob-
ably be received from customs fiom 1836 to 1842,
inclusively
3   The amount of revenue which will probably
be received from public lands firthesamepenod,
if no change takes place in the price of the lands
4   The amount of revenue from thesamesource,
if the price of the refuse [anda should be reduced,
and the lands snould be so disposed of as to pro-
mote the settlement of the country, and should
cease to Be a source of revenue, except to defray
tne expenbes of their management, and of extin-
guishing the Indian titles
5    The times and proportions in which the
amount of stock held in the Bank of the United
States wi 1 probably be returned to the Treasury,
it no act is passed by Congress for the sale of said
StOLk
6    The probable amount of the expenditures of
the Government annually to the end of the year
18-12
7    The state of the fortifications, so as to show
the number of forts of the first, second, and third
classes, now constructed in the United States, the
number heretofore proposed and recommended by
the War Depaitnient,but notyet constructed; and
the number which would probably be necessaiy
to the complete and adequate defence of the lake,
maritime, and gulf frontier of the United States,
and such points of the land frontier as may be
believed to requiie permanent fortifications
8    The amount expended since 1816, in con-
structing forts, and the amount that would proba-
bly be necessary to complete the construction of
tre ert le system of permanent fortifications for
the United Sutes
9    Tne ame tint whici has been expended since
lsl6 in provums for ti e armament of the fortifi-
cation^ and ihe amiunt which would probably
be necessary to complete the armament of all the
fortresses, required for the defence of the United
Slates
¡0 The imoun'wlndi would probably beneces-
sa-y to construct an adequate number of armories
and arsenals in the United States, and to supply
the Slice*, wi'h field artillery (especially brass
pieces) 'or their militia, and with side arms and
pistols, for their cavalry
11    The amount eX| ended since 1816 on the
grtdual mcrea-eof the Nuvy,on navy-yards,and
dork yards, and the amount necessary to be ex-
pended on eseh of these objects, to place the naval
defence of the Lnited States upon the footing of
strength and respecfibiluy which is due to the
beuni v and iO Ihe wellare of the Union
12     \m\ that the President be íequested toeause
to be communicated to the Senate, at the same
time, any other infirmation connected with the
reiemie srd expend ture of the Government, and
with the defence oí the Union, which shall come
within the seo] e of the foiegomg inquiries, on
which, m luR ludgment, shall be necesbary to be
communicated
Iir OLOTION OF DUTIES.
Tfu f< lio«.n " lesolu'ion, submitted on Monday
by Mi   0\LHOCN, was taken up and agieed to
AYtoW, That the Secretary of the Treasury
be direutd to report to the Senate, at the com-
memement of the next session of Congress, what i
DEBTS OF THE POST OFTICE DEPARTMENT.
Mr. HILL'S resolutions relattve to the validity
and binding nature of the debts of the Post Office
Department, were, on his motion, postponed to
and made the special order for Tuesday next
POST OFFICE AFrAIRS.
The resolution submitted some days smce by
Mr SMITH, relative to the affairs of the Post
Office, was also taken up, and on his motion it
was made the special order for the same day
OFFICERS' COMMUTATION.
The resolution submitted on Tuesday by Mr
HILL, calling upon the Secretary of the Treasury
for information, whether the evidence of payments
of commutation have been lost, and whether there
is reason to believe the officers who received their
commutation were not entitled to it, &.C., was
taken up and agreed to.
THE CUMBERLAND ROAD.
The bill making appropriations for the continua-
tion and repair of the Cumberland road, was read
the third time and passed
DUTIES ON RAILROAD IRON.
The Senate proceeded to considei, as in Com-
mittee of the Whole, the bill authorizing a remis-
sion of duties on ail railroad cars and car irons,
which were ordeied prior to tne ls! January last
Mr HILL asked that some good reason might
be given by the committee why the bill should
pass
Mi. TYLER said he thought the bill explained
itself
Mr. HILL said his objection was, that he did
not know why these large companies should be
exempt from the payment of duties rather than
individuals.
Mr TYLCR said this was a subject m which
the public had a direct interest It was not simply
for the benefit of the large companies
Mr. PRELINGHUYSEN said he saw no
reason for the remission of duties upon these am-
ueles, or that they should be refunded if they had
been paid Our iron establishments were quite
sufficient to supply all the demand for those arti-
cles, as he had been informed by a manufacturer,
and at a reasonable price Why then should we
piefer the foreign manufacture to our domestic
establishments He moved that the bill be laid
on the table
The motion was agreed to
I               THE HISTORY OF CONGRESS.
The Senate then proceeded to the consideration
of the joint resolution reported by the Libraiy
Committee, authorizing tne puichase of five hun-
dred copies of Carey & Lea's  History of Con-
i gress
l     Mr  HILL asked the committee to give some
reason why this bill snould pass
Mr. KING, of Georgia, expressed a wish that
the bill might be permitted to he on the table until
the information called for fiom the Secretary of
the Senate, relative to the amount of printing au-
thorized by Congress, could be had It was essen-
tial, to enable lis to act understanding^ on this
subject, that the infoimation called for should be
obtained, it was indispensable With regaid to
the value of this work, (Mr K said,) it might be
a good and useful woik, and it might be, like
many others we had puichased, totally useless
! and worthless
1     Mr P01NDEXTER enlarged upon the merits
' of the work, he said it could not progress with

duties under twenty per cent ad valorem, as pro- ,1 out the patronage of the Uoveinment    It was of
15
great utility to every statesman, because it con-
tained the whole history and proceedings of Con-
gress and the Government in a condensed form,
and gentlemen could not afford to purchase it for
then private libraries
Mr BEN f ON said, that about seven years ago,
the Senate purchased one oftho&e works called a
Political Registei, and he took occasion to look
into it to examine it closely, and found it to be a
complete exemplification ot the suggtitw falsi and
suppressioven Many things were omitted which
members said, and many things weie put into
their mouths which they never did say So far
as he himself was concerned, (Mi. B said,) it
contained a general libel on him. He looked over
the Register of the last session, and he believed
that in the matter that there appeared under his
name, there was not one paragraph which was
not more oi less a downright falsification of what
he said, and there was haidly a sentiment m it, or
a fact stated in it, which he actually said. There
were two papers in this city, the Telegraph and
National Intelligencer, both of winch, three or four
years ago, were very obliging to him. They both
unifoimly published his speeches, and whenever
he desired alterations to be made in them, they
did it very obligingly, and whenever he wanted
to improve them, (anU he did not hesitate to say
that he did improve them,) they cheerfully con-
sented to it But within the last three years, both
those papers had entirely changed their conduct
towards him One of them, the National Intel-
ligencer, refused, out and out. to publish one of
his speeches against the Bank of the United States,
Yes, su, they refused to publish his mam speech,
on the ground that it was too long, and when he
afterwards offered to aDridgeit, they totally refused
to publish it, while they published everything that
was said on the other side The Telegraph did
the same thin , and the gentlemen on the other
side not only saw the notes, but the proofs too
With respect to the proposition now before the
Senate to buy these books, he perceived there the
name of one of the employees of the Bank of the
United States, and he had received information
from Philadelphia that tnese persons were busily
engaged last winter in keeping and fomenting the
panic which was in a course of pieparation and
performance. He was opposed to this proposi-
tion, because, among other reasons, this History
of the Congress of the United States by Cary &
Lea, was a history of Congress by the Bank of
the United States This was all he had to say on
tlii* sub]eet at this time But with regard to this
business of printing in the Senate, it exceeded all
the other abuses of the Government, including the
Post Office, put together In 1819 the expenses
for printing amounted to fifteen thousand dollars;
while last year, he believed, it amounted to one
hundied and fifty thousand dollars ' And propo-
sitions for single jobs passed here, almost without
opposition, incurring an expendituie equal to the
whole sum pa'd in 1819 He took the opportu-
nity now to give notice that as often as proposi-
tions were introduced here for extra jobs, he would
be biought to his feet, and on the subject of this
great and crying abuse, he would show them to
the country in ail their enormity And also show
that, while we were seeking to remove the mote
from the eye of others, we would not perceive the
beam m our own
Mr KING, oi Georgia, said that, where prop-
ositions had been made to puichase works, in
this way, he always purchased them with his
own money Eut the value and usefulness of
them would vanish like a sprite, if a proposition
should be introduced to make the expenditure for
them out of our own pockets He did not know
the value of this -work, as he befoie remarked.
But he did know that it would be very expensive.
Honorablegentlemen agreed that such works were
rece«sary to us in the discharge of our legislative
duties If they were so, he would be willing to
vote money enough to purchase a sufSc.ent num-
