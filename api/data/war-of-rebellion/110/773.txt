timbers for a pontoon road of the size of the pontoons constructed under your charge. If the necessary timbers can be procured, do you desire the pontoons to be constructed at Corinth or at Selma, and the officer under whose immediate supervision the boats were built at Atlanta can be spared to take charge of their construction now? General Taylor has been directed to forward all the pontoons to Corinth. General Beauregard also desires to be informed whether any duplicate railroad bridges have been constructed for the road between Atlanta and Chattanooga, and if so where they now are.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
