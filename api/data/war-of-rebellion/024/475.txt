The number of prisoners taken on the advance here proves over 1,200. Besides these, many deserters come in daily to take the oath of allegiance and return home to the border States. I have permitted in arms, to take the oath and go home. A letter from General McClernand, just received, states that he expects to go forward in a few days. Sherman has already gone. The enterprise would be much safer in charge of the latter.

Following dispatch just received from Corinth, Miss., December 10, 1862:

Major General U. S. GRANT:

The news from Bragg is that Kirby Smith is at Murfreesborough, Breckinridge at Shelbyville, Bragg a short distance from Tullahoma. The railroad is finished from Athens to Tennessee River, thence to Huntsville. This may account for the accelerating accumulation of forage on railroad which runs from Florence to that railroad. I have seen several men from Bragg's army with twenty days' furlough. They say Bragg intends to stay where he is. Provisions getting very scarce is Tennessee Valley and north of it.
