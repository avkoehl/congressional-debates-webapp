column should be kept under cover as much as possible, so as to avoid the fire of the enemy's batteries, and seek cover to all possible extent consistently with a demonstration. At the same time all our batteries should open on the center of the enemy's line. As this movement, if properly timed, should be substantially over, let the troops take nothing but their canteens filled and cartridge-boxes. So much depends on your executive and skill that I forbear making other details the subject of an order.
