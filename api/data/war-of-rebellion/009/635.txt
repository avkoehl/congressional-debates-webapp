Mexico) is a great political feature of the rebellion. It will gain the rebels a name and a prestige over Europe, and operate against the Union cause. It therefore should not only be checked, but it should at any future period during the spring or summer be rendered impossible. These Texans will not rest with the forces they have already with them, but they will have large additions to their command here, in order to extend their conquest toward old Mexico and in the direction of Southern California. I therefore beg you, in the name of Colonel Canby, who is fighting two to one, and laying valuable lives upon this issue, to send at once-lose not a day-at least two regiments infantry and a battery of rifled cannon to Fort Union. These troops cannot serve the Government better than by saving this Territory. Do not depend on the New Mexican regiments serving in Kansas; they are not filled up nor ready for the field. Send us troops already organized; they can start by the time this reaches you.

Believe no reports you may hear of the number of troops Canby has. I have given you a true picture of the state of this country, and if you wish to save it, you, I hope and pray, will act immediately in its favor.

I remain, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GURDEN CHAPIN,

Captain, Seventh Infantry, Acting Inspector-General.

Colonel Canby has but 1,100 men, exclusive of his volunteers, and the Texans have at least 2,200, all mounted.

Please inform the headquarters Department of New Mexico, Santa Fe, what you can do for this country, and if you cannot help us, be kind enough to acknowledge the receipt of this communication.
