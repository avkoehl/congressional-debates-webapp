THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 10,
powerful a corporation—though perhaps unable
to restrain, and therefoie not so lesponsible for
the harangues of some of its advocates, on what-
ever days, places, 01 occasions—liad not, in us
own resolutions, íepoits of committees, and es
says and pamphlets, published by its  piesident,
under a vote " to cause to be pieptiod and encu
lated such documents and papers as may com-
municate to the people infoimation in lcgaid to
the nature and operations of the Eank"—eaiher
used a little mote cffoit to practice the same foi
bearance fiom attempting " to inflame the pas
sions of the countiy "   How fitly the Bank cm
now become the censor of the President 01  this
Depaitment for also communicating " to the peo
pie infoimation on the natme and operations of
the bank," and that infoimation consisting only
of official correspondence on both sides—must be
left to others to decide
Yom last letter having at length been leccived,
and having, asappears, been aheady sentto " the
newspapeis" by the bank, without waiting for a
reply, and before one, in the gieat piessme of
ímsmess at this, season, could be expected, its
contents are m some paiticulars found to be so
veiy extiaordinaiy in then tone, in their allu
sions, and assertions, that, eyijileasant, as the task
is, this Departmt nt has, undei all the encum
stances, felt constiained to submit such íemaiks
m íeíuion to them as aic deemed appiopriato,
and as seem imperatively to be requued The
bank may, thei tfoi e, su, i est assui ed, that though
youi lettei ailived so late as to pievuit the sub
mission of it to the Piesident liefoie piepanng
hi* annual message^ or to the Attorney Geneial
befoie Ins opinion was íequtsted on the case, and
as to depnve the undei signed from offering any
due comment on it in his report to Congress con-
cerning this subject, yet, in i elation to the affans
of which it tieats, an " appeal fiom the laws" has
ne\ei, as you appeal to ínümite, been made by
this .Department, noi is one in contemplation
Any such " appeal" is left to those who, without
the sanction of an appropriation by Congicss,oi
■without a legal picupt, su7c upon the public
property, md conveit it to then pnvite emolu

yi t to Itain, that buhth cliiiictta of that Clin f
Magistiatc, and the obligations oí duty intei
tamed by this Depaitment, hive been breatly
misappn hinded
In piocciding to the othei contents of youi
letter", it is conceded with you, " that the whole
case ippcais exceedingly simple " The bulk
sets up a clum agunst tin Umtrd Stites It is
piesented and disillowid by the accounting offi
cei s, bee luse considi red m itself neitliei eqmt ible
nor legal, because it had neiei lecuved tin sine
Uon of tin United States by an appiopnation
and becausi, if just, no bian h of Un Govern
merit, except Cmgicss, had my Co istituti nal
powci to authoiiS   its paymint
Thpieupon the bank, inste id of lesorting to
Congiess for that stuition, p ooeeded withiut
it, and without any legil pu eept, to seize on th
dividends belonging to the United States and to
< (invert ih m to its puv ite use The vit il enor
of the bank on this subp et appears to h ivc been
m supposing tint the lieasui y ind its account
ing olhocis weic anything but mcie agents of
Congiess to supcunti id the settlement oí vl at
has been appiopnated It, on the solicitation of
the bank, or any mdividuil, howcvei poivcifu!,
they illowed 01 setth d anything else tlivnwhu
had been smetioned by an appiopiiafion,itwould
manifestly Le conniving it peculation, 01 a mis
application of the public monev It must be
well known to tin bank tl at Ine fust and piopei
ltiquny at the litasuiy to eveiy applicant is,
where is the appiopnation to pay the elaim'
And, next, whcie is the evidence ot Us conect
ness, under the appiopridlion  It seems íathei
unreasonable to insist  that the Treasuiy pos
sesses almost unlimited power when the bank
wants favois, but to deny to it almost all power
when apprehending dangei from it
Besides all the decisive reasons aigaiust the icp
íehensible conduct of the bank in thistiansaction,
which are contained in the late message of the
President, and in the opinion of the Attorney
Geneial, the bank, if it possesses, as has been
intimated, another contioveited claim against the
United States, for the removal of the public de
posits, might, on this principle, in ordei to dis
chaige it, or atone for any othei pietended wiong,
not only lefuse to pay over dividends, but refuse,
to the amount claimed, the payment of its notes
or bills received by the Tie isui y foi the public
revenue, and when this consideiation is weighed
it will íeadily be seen that the whole opeiations
of the Government in war and in peace, while, by
law, the notes of the bulk must be n ceived foi
the public levenue, are liable, at the pkasme of
the bank, to be paialyzed, and the public faith
thereby violated
After these objections,and when the common,
the equitable, and constitutional tubunal of Con
gress was, and still is, for the bank, is for all
other claimants against the Government similarly
situated, open foi a íesoit to obtain damages—it
is lamented, that the bank was so inconsidciately
advised as to appeal to this othei course, so novel,
aangeious, ind unneeessaiy, of seizing upon the
public levenue, as being in your opinion "the
best, if not only couise of settling the question "
You stite fui ther, that this has been done by the
bank only " to vindícete its own lights," when
no case is believed to exist where a peison not
leeeivingmoney as an officei or contiactor of the
Government, oi money not previously granted by
Congress undei soint special oi geneial appro
puation, (in which mode the bank did not receive
these dividends,) has evoi been able to "vindi
cate" Ins supposed "lights," by lotaimng the
money to met t any claims, however well founded,
against the Government and when application
by the bank foi relief in this case had never been
piesented to Congress, and refused, so*as to
furnish the slightest apology for being obliged,m
oider to piocuie redicss, to íesoit to this unusu-il
lcmedy
But if the views of the Department on this pio
(ceding be enoneous, much giatification would
be denved fiom having  the paiticulir act and
eluise quoted by the bmk, on which it íelns m
making the iss< ition, that " the letanung of this
money was a m( re foun to comply with tin ai t of
Congress "    This Depntment has not been so
fe i tun ite as to disc ov i any st itute, and much less
the one i ited of Mai eh 3, 1797, whnh if quaes
oí a claimant against the Government, that he
should, in a contioveited case, seize its property
in oidi i " to comply with the act of Congiess,"
noi any statute wlueh   iuthou/es, íecogmzcs, or
palhites such scmtic, in oider to foice the Gov
eminent into i l\w suit, md thus, thiough the
ag( ncy of the judici uy, attempt to effect the pay
mt nt of doubtful el inns, to which no money has
bcdiappiopiiiud, nor legislative sanctiongive n
The pioposition of the bmk to make some ai
umgc an it to have this question biought " befoie
the (Otiits," and the assui anee now given that,
in such event, i„ "would niimedi itely have re
leised the money," would have d soiled much

is ni inri  been  nioic piomptly given, and tint
umcible disposition now   manifest been eaiher

intimation of adesne to mikeany "anang ment

picscned  peifect silence, and  the Depaitment
and Congi   ss having thus been lulled into secu
nty till aftei the adjournment of the latter, then
I  siddenly, and without pievious notice, a poi
tion of the acciumg levenue  estimated and ex
pected to a d in meeting the lugp ippropn tions

I j termination of a suit, ptouably pi otracted for many
i i ye ars   Aftei comnuttn g that aggiess on, and stm
withholding in its possession the money of the
United States, the bank then, and not till then,
" invited ' this Depaitment to bnn^ the subject of
the damages in some way befoie the com ts, and
thus indirectly to sanction the app°a! of the bank
fiom the authority of Congress ovei this m ittcr,
and to acquiesce, till adjusted by litigation, in the
bank's unpieeedcnted and mmous couise as to
the public revenue—a course invoh inga puní iple
which, undei all the cucumstanc  s of this case,
if once adopted, might disorganize oui whole
collections, by the seizure of them, without 1 gal
piecept, under one pretense or another and, as
pieviously explained, phce even om disburse
ments, so fai as the jjubhc funds consist of Uni
ted States bank notes, at the sole meicy of an
lmtited and unscrupulous coipoiation But this
the Depiitmcnt could not smction, howevei ui
gently "invited," without proving-futhless to
eveiy pnneiple of public duty and pub'ie safety
Late as even that invitation it is íemai kable 'hat
youi letteis expressed nothing about the mo ley
itself "being an object of mdiffeicnce to the
bank," oi that it " would instantly haveiekast d
the money in any anangem nt with the Treas
uiy to bung the case before the courts " On the
contiaiy, though some persons may, foi some
time, have appichended, fiom certain cncum-
stances, that money was' anobjectof lndiffcK nee
to the bank," m companson with some other
objects, yi tit is difficult to dis over "wh ltiignts"
the bmk then sought to " vindicate," except its
rights to the money, and why it should be so
tenacious of its lights to the money, and so in
different to the money itself By youi cone
spondence, it that time, the money appeals to
have been withheld w ith the express view to foice
the Department into a consent to pay the contio
verted damages claimed, withoutany sanction by
Congiess, or into some amvngement to submit to
the judiciaiy, for decision, a question which,
under the Constitution and the ciieumstances of
the case, belongs to Congiess alone, and, after
that decision, and not till then,if unfavoiable, to
make a lestoiation of the dividends the bank had
so unexpectedly seized, in derogation of the laws,
It was not " until the time had passed foi the
lepetition of a similai appeal from the laws' by
the bank to cover its other intimated claim for
dam iges, on account of the removal of the de-
posits, with any probable hope of public appio
bation in favoi of its new mode ot aiding the
fiscal opeiations of the Government, and not till
aftei those " elections" to which you refei may,
m your opinion have terminated so dis tstronsly
to its hopes, that the bank piofessed a peifect
"indiiFeieiice" about the money, and a willing
ness to íelease it, m case an ainngement was
effected for a suit at law
How a suit could still proceed, and the money
be fiist íolcased or repaid, must be left to the
bank foi fiuther exjilanation, as it is mcompre
hensible to this Depaitment, unless effeittd
through some fictitious case, to be agu <d on, m
oidei to ¿eprive Congress of its constitution U
power ovei apjiropuitions to settle contested
claims against the United Slates, a ndvi Inch igiee
ment, you may íestassuied, that this Di paitmtnt
has as little inclination as it has legitimate povei
to make
It maybe piopei.then, to state fuithei and dis-
anc tly, that the submission of the whole case to the
, wisdom and authority of Congress appeals to the
I Tieisuiy to be the only suitablecouise  and that
it cannot enter into any arrangement in rel ition
to the subject, except to re ene, as rccm sted in
its communication  to the bank m Jujy last, the

I knovilcdsanei ts of this Depaitment should not be
omitted for youi  kindness in pointing outmoie
than  one  mode that  mi^ht be puistied m   the
i ourts of law against the bank   but, aithc advice
of an opposing ¡jaity is not alwiys safest, and as
j Congiess is competent to give dneotions upen the
I claim of th   United ¡states, and is consideicd the
proper   tubunal for adjusting the claim  ot   the
