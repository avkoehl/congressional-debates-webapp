CHATTANOOGA, October 28, 1863.

Major General AMBROSE E. BURNSIDE,

Knoxville, Tennessee:

If you have not designated an officer to take command at Louisville, I would like to send Major-General Rousseau.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

JONESBOROUGH, October 28, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

My scouts all bring in reports corroborating statements of Burke to General Willcox. There is no question but the enemy is advancing in large force. I will fall back to Greeneville to-day. I have sent orders to Colonel Garrard, at Rogersville, to send his train to Bull's Gap, and, if the enemy advanced in overwhelming numbers, to fall back to Bull's Gap with his command.

J. M. SHACKELFORD,

Brigadier-General.

GREENEVILLE, October 28, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

The operator at Loudon sends me word my cipher dispatch of yesterday p. m. was incorrect. The blunder is not in the cipher, but the purport of it is this: Burke says the plan is for a heavy cavalry force to move rapidly down through Kingsport, Rogersville, and try and take us in rear, striking at Knoxville. Perhaps their infantry move by Carter's Station, Jonesborough, &amp;c.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

IUKA, October 28, 1863.

General DODGE, Corinth:

A messenger just arrived from Chattanooga, with dates of 24th, makes it necessary for me to drop everything, and with my old corps (Fifteenth) push for Stevenson. Push your preparations to follow with all possible speed, working night and day. Cross at Eastport and follow, via Florence, Athens, Huntsville, to Stevenson.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

U. S. MISSISSIPPI SQUADRON, FLAG-SHIP BLACK HAWK,

Cairo, October 28, 1863.

Major General WILLIAM T. SHERMAN,

Eastport, Tennessee:

DEAR GENERAL: I have only time to write a few lines, but now that communication is open between us, you shall hear from me often. I am glad you have the gunboats with you, for though, as the reporters say, "they do nothing," yet I know you don't object to having them on certain occasions. I intend to line the Tennessee with gunboats, and promise you that your communication shall never be interrupted if there is water in the river.

Very truly and sincerely,

DAVID D. PORTER,

Rear-Admiral.
