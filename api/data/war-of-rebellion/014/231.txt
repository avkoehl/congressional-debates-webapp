showing the necessity of the troops here asked for. Please let me know by telegraph whether my request can be complied with.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

McCLELLAN'S, June 16, 1862-11.30 a.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The following just received
HEADQUARTERS,Suffolk, Sunday Evening.

Major-General McCLELLAN:

A deserter came into this post from Richmond. He left after the battle of Fair Oaks. He says they have sent the public records and a large amount of ammunition to Danville. Mrs. Jefferson Davis has moved into North Carolina. He says Richmond is strongly fortified, and they mean to fight to the last, and have about 130,000 men, but are on half rations, and the rank and file, many of the m, anxious to get away. An Englishman who came in from there recently thinks they have 150,000 men.

MANSFIELD,

Brigadier-General.

This corresponds with the accounts I have received from various sources. Please let me know when and which direction McDowell's command will come.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

McCLELLAN'S HEADQUARTERS, June 16, 1862-7 p.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have to request that some improvement may be made by the Ordnance Department in the fuses for the 20-pounder Parrott guns. Those now in use burn very irregularly-as likely to burst for 2,000 yards when cut for 800 as for 800 when cut for 2,000. The firing discourages us, as it encourages our enemies.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

[Major-General.]

FORT MONROE, June 16, 1862-9 p.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

The telegraph wires have been extended to Norfolk, and I now have communication with that city and Suffolk. General Viele telegraphs congratulations on the completion of the line and on the improved feeling in Norfolk. General McClellan has extended my command to Yorktown, Gloucester, and Williamsburg.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
