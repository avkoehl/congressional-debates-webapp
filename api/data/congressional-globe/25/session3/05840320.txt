Ho, ot Reps.
of two yearsfiom the date of the certificate, m con-
formity with the provisions of the act of 1819, for
the Territory of Michigan
Nor was any legal inference deducible from the
fact of its being dated in October He (Mi C)
held a ceitificate of his own election to Congress
dated in Novembei last But that certificate gave
him no claim to a seat in the present Congress In
Massachusetts (as nought to be in all the States,
and was in many of them) elections for Congress
were held in anticipation of the period when, by
the practical construction of the Constitution,
each Congress hadits legal commencement, name-
ly, the 4th of March of each alternate year It
was neither strange nor irregular to hold the elec-
tion for a second period of service during the cur-
rency of the first period On the contraiy, it was
the njost regular course* because thus only could
there be a complete Congress ready to come into
existence on the expnation of an existing Con-
gress To be sure, m his certificate the teim of
service wa3 defined. But suppose it had not beca
would that vary the cast.' Not at all If the ten-
ure of service were not expressed, the law of the
land would came iu to supply it, justas precisi ly
and ceiiamlyas if the law had beui reeittd in the
certificate, and SO it must be in the case of Mi
Doty
But the Committee on Elections say that, "' ac-
coidnig to common construction in all such cases,
where an obligation is impost d, or a duty to be
peiformtd, and no time fixed foi discharging the
obligation or n< rforming the duty, it is to be done
forthwith " Mr C said he could not agree that
Buch was the " common i onstruction " In some
cases the obligation or duty attaches forthwith,
in others, after a loasonablo time, in others, on
demand or notice and.as the only umveisal rule,
the obligation or duty is to be discharged or pi r-
formed at such time aa the law of the land ap-
plicable to the subject-matter prescribes and do-
fines, no that nothing t  concluded by the date of
Mi Duty's election, oi of his ce(lificate Weare
to look to the law of the land—that is, the Con-
stitution or acts of Congress—toawtrtnin the
tenure of office of a Delegate from Wisconsin
In fact, if the ceitificate had been expiess, it
eould only havo rcf< rrcd to and lecogniyed the
law of the land as dpfinin" th< tenuie of ofliee
The Govmior could not, by his cuttficate, create
a new tenuie of office dilhicnt than thai pie-
Bpribid by statule 'Ihus,iii his own certificate
bof ire cued, the tenure was "for the teim by the
ConiMuhmt oflhtiaid United Stateverjireswd, coni-
mencmg,"&( Th< same gi neral principle must
control and construe Mi   Doty's certificate
Nor do the othei pails of the ratifícate contra
diet but, on the other hand, they sustain and
confirm this ronsltuclion Tin election was held,
nays the certificate, in conformity with the act of
Conguss establishing the Temtoiy and the laws
of «aid femtory. It could not lawfully be held
otherwise These words seem to leíate only to
tin mode of election, but if they extended fuilhcr,
and affected in any way the tenuie and term of
service, they would not vary the conclusion
Tor the inquiry in either alternative would be
the same What say the laws of the Temtoiy '
Abovi all, what says the oiganic act of Congress
establishing the territorial government 
This act passed April 20, 183G, to take effect
the 4th of July following, piovidcs
'"5sc 14 Tinta ri'lcgitc to the House nf Ri presenta
Uves of ¡be lioiud Suite , to atrve for the turn ol two

in the same manner a  the Governor shall appoint and di
reot, die person having th« greatest number ot votes shall
*>e declared by the Governor to be duly elected, and a cer
Uficate Uiercof shall be given to the person so eleucd "
This act is explicit in providing that the Dele-
gate shall be elected " to serve for the term of two
years," but it does not in so many words fix the
termita of the peuod of service And if the act
contained nothing else on the subject, and there
were no other law expressly applicable to the
case, the presumption would certainly be in favor
of making the term conformable to that of mem-
bers of the House of Representatives chosen by
the Srttes under tí  Constitution Mr. C, 4>d &ei
mean to be understood-as affirming that the pro-
visions of the Constitution in regard to members
of the House were of necessity applicable to Del-
egates fiom Ten ttoues He was aware that Del-
egates had been treated as cieatures of law rather
than of the Constitution, and Congress had in the
case of Michigan, and in some older cases, given
its sanction to the idea that Delegates fiom the
Territories might be chosen for a term differing
fiom the constitutional term of Representatives
fiom the States But such a diffeience constituted
an anomaly It was also an inconvenient anom-
aly! because the effect of it would be, if the Dele
gate held a seat for two yeais, partly in one Con
gress and partly in another, lie roust be twice
qualified, and twice subject to have his seat con-
tested in successive Houses And the anomaly
would be the greater and the more inconvenient,
if, as in the case of Michigan, the term of service
not only covered fractions of two successive Con-
giesses, but was subject to a shifting and arbi-
traty commencement, depending on the date of
the certificate The presumption of law, there
foie, it theie were nothing in the act of 1836, or
in any other act, to control the presumption, or
define (hi case specifically, would bi in favor of
the gem ral prim iple of a tei m of service ioi the
Delegato from Wisconsin coriespondmg to the
constitutional periods of Congress
But though the act of 1836 contains nothing to
control this geneial presumption, yet it does ion
tain a provision which supports thnt presumption
The Committee on Elections err in saying that
the act of 183G "is peifect in itself, and would
seem to be independent of all other acts "   Iter
fiessly refers us to some other acts or act on thit>
very point     It declares that the Delegate from
Wisconsin " shall be entitled to the same lights
and privileges as have been granted to the Dele
gates of the several T<.intoues,"&c     It estab-
lishes a rule to measure his " rights and puvi
leges, and refers us for this rule to sonic provisions
oflaw governing " the sevcial Tei utories " m this
matter
Is there any such provision foi " the several
Taritones?" 1 hr i< is It is n it the statute of

This is the act, and the only act, which, so fai
as regards the teim of service, defines the rights
and privileges of the Delegates of the several
Ttiritones of the United States It was enacted
foi the very purpose of doing away the inconve-
nient anomaly of a teim of service for Delegates
difXetcnt from that of Representatives It is not
repealed by the act of April, 1836, establishing
the teintorinl government of Wisconsin. It is
not repealed expressly, that is plain enough, for
the latter act omits to define the peuod of service
cxpicsaly, and, above all, omits to ricnact the
peculiar provision of the Michigan act of 1819
Nor is it repealed by implication, for the two
acts of 1817 and 1836 are compatible in terms
I hey are consistent in meaning Placed side by
side they constitute a complete and coherent
whole The act of 1836 does not cover the whole
subject, but leaves us to go elsewhere to discover
the termini of the term of service it contemplates,
it expressly rpfers us to some general law on the
subject, and that general law, as to this point,
is the act of 1817, which thus comes in to con
tmue the act of 1836,and to construe Mr Doty's
certificate, and to make his term of service begin
on the 4th of March next, and be coextensive
with the Twenty Sixth Congiess
Mr C said he did not see how it was posst
ble, in the face of the several statutes he had col
lated, to escape this conclusion, nor could the
committee have escapedit it it had not mixed up
the case of Mr Doly with that of Mr Jones,
and undertaken to measure the term of set vice of
Mr Dotvj qat by tjie plain law oi* the ease applied I
to his certificate, but by some irregularities, real
or supposed, in the preceding tenure  of Mr
Jones     Mr   C   contended that the two  cases
were, in point of fact, absolutely distinct   What-
ever might be the facts in the ease of Mr Jones,
that of Mr Doty must stand upon its own facts
Those facts are, that at an election in Wiscon
sin,  duly held in September, he  received   the
highest number of votes for the office of Delegate
to Congress, and that he holds the Governor's
certificate to this effect   And those facts are to be
governed by the letter of statute, not by what Mr
Jones may have done in the Twenty Fourth
Congress    Mr Jonesdid notand could notmako
or alter the law    Nor do the peculiar and anoma-
lous facts appertaining to the admission of Mich-
igan vary the law applicable to the case of Mr,
Doty     Suppose a gentleman to come here from
Massachusetts, and show that, in November lasi
he was elected to succeed him (Mr  C ) in the
next Congress that would not give him the place
m this Congress   No, though ho should proceed
further, and show that he (Mr  C ) was now sit-
ting hep   by mistake, oi  by open usurpation of
right    The applicant mitbt pievail on the legal
impoit of Ins own iltctton find his own tertifi
cati , y< t, as the uiegulai lti sin the action of Mr
Jones, or of the  [louse, in the inudmts of the
I'wfnty rVmith Congress, had become involved
with the picsont snlij et in the lepoi t ot tht Com
nuttee of Flections, and in the minds of honor-
able membeis, so as to confuse and obscure the
wlioh   case, Mr   C   would cinsonly  state  his
view of the cl urns of Ml   Jones
Mr Jones received two years ago the follow-

Mi C thought all the principles of law apph-
rabh to the ceitificate of Mr Doty apply to this
It diiTi rs in woids, but not in It gal import Or
il theie be any diflir rencc in the legal import, it is
more in fnvor of the doctrine deduced fiom Mr
Doty's, that the term of service is intended to be
comridtnt with that of Itepiesentatives from the
Stati s It expressly cites the act of April, 1836,
as governing both the election and the period of
service By the election of 1836, and the certifi-
cate issued thereon,Mr Jones became a Delegate
in the Twenty Fifth Congiess, and for the two
yeais of that Congress and no other, beginning
on the 4th of Maich, 1837, and terminating on
the 3d of March, 1831, in the same way that, by
the election of 1838, Mr Doty became a Delegate
in the Twenty Sixth Congress, beginning on the
4th of Maich, 1839, and ctntinuing for two years
from that time The two certificates are per-
fectly consistent, and have both of them a clear
and certain construction when collated with the
acts of 1836 and 1817, and they thus free the two
cases of Mr Jones and Mr Doty from all collis-
ion or contrariety
Mr C said he should not enter into any dis-
cussion of the peculiarities in the position of Mr
Jones in the Twenty Fourth Congress, any fur-
ther than to suggest why those facts could not
control the present case There was much room
for debate concerning them, but they might all
be admitted without shaking the principles he
had laid down as the basis of his own conclu-
sions Thus, it is assumed that if Mi Jones be
held entitled to his scat heie the present session,
the effect will be to give him a service of three
vears Not so If his certificate in 1836 did
not, by legal construction, take effect until the 4th
of March, 1837, then the two years have not yet
expued, and the error lies in assuming that he
sat in the second session of the Twenty Fourth
Congress under that certificate Suppose he sat
here wrongfully that session how could such a
fact vary the legal construction of th,e present
