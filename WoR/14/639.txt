LEWIS E. HARVIE,

President Richmond and Danville Railroad:

SIR: General Lee and the Secretary of War are both exceedingly anxious to push rapidly to completion certain defensive works on or near the James River. For this purpose hands were called out in Halifax, Charlotte, Lunenburg, Pittsylvania, and Campbell Counties, but have failed to come in except in small numbers. One difficulty met with I understand is want of transportation on your road. If such is the case, may I ask your attention to the subject as one of great importance at this particular moment.

With great respect, your obedient servant,

ALFRED L. RIVES,

Acting Chief of Engineer Bureau.
