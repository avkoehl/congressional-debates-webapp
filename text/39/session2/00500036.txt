REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
Mr. WADE'from the Committee on Territo-
ries, to whom was referred the bill (S. No. 456)
for the admission of the State of Nebraska into
the Union, reported it without amendment.
official tenbre.
Mr. EDMUNDS. The joint select com-
mittee on retrenchment, to whom was referred
the bill (S. No. 453) to regulate the tenure of
offices, have had the same under consideration,
and have instructed me to report the bill back,
with a recommendation of certain amendments^
which being adopted the Committee are of
opinion that the bill ought to pass. I beg leave
to say in connection with this report that we
have reported this bill and these amendments
regulating removals from oSice and appoint-
ments to office so far as concerns officers whose
nominations require the confirmation of the
Senate, and have.adopted what appears to us to
be a feasible scheme in that respect, in no spirit
of hostility to any party or administration what-
ever, but in what we conceive to be the true
republican interest of the country under all
administrations, under the domination of all
parties in the growth which is before us in the
future ; and in that spirit I shall ask the atten-
tion of the Senate to the bill when it comes to
be considered. I move that the amendments
be printed, and that the bill bo made the spe-
cial order for Thursday next, at one o'clock.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amend-
ments will bo printed with the bill under the
rule. A motion in regard to the bill can be
entertained only by unanimous consent, as no
action can be had on a bill on the day it is
reported except by unanimous consent. _ The
Senator from Vermont moves that this bill be
made the special order for Thursday next,^ at
one .o'clock in the afternoon. >To objection
being made to the motion, the Chair will put
it to the Senate.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I do not know that I
shall object; I would as soon agree that this
bill be made a special order as any other; but
I wish to warn the Senate against embarrassing
themselves at this early period of the session
with special orders. They have been found
heretofore exceedingly embarrassing. They
generally interfere with each other, and I think
effect nothing in the way of facilitating action
upon any particular bill. I suggest to the Sen-
ator whether it would not be as well for him to
give notice that he will call it up on that day,
and thus, I think, effect all his purpose without
having these special orders entered, as there
will be many of them on the Calendar. I shall
not, of course, interpose any objection, but I
rose merely to make the suggestion to my friend
from Vermont in case he considers it favorably.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Iaraquitewillingtoadopt
tho- suggestion of the honorable Senator from
Maine. I agree to the propriety of what he
says, and as he ha* been here long enough to
take the responsibility of initiating such a course
of proceeding, T am quite willing to follow it,
and to waive the motion that I have made, with
the understanding thatrif I think it proper here-
after I shall insist upon the same objection,
which I conceive myself is advantageous to the
administration of business.
The PRESIDENT^â„¢ tempore. The motion
to fix Thursday next as the day for the special
consideration of this bill is withdrawn.
