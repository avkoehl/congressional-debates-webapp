GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,

No. 23. Tullahoma, February 6, 1863.

I. A rigid investigation of the returns and muster-rolls of this army, commenced two months since, and which is still being pursued, has developed the astonishing fact that several thousand officers and men are absent, in violation of the orders of the commanding general, and upon permission granted and details ordered by every grade of commissioned officer from lieutenant up. The parties committing these offenses will be held to a strict accountability for the past, and their official acts closely scrutinized for the future. The country is full of straggling officers and soldiers holding no other authority than these assumptions, who are hereby required to return to their posts and resume their duties.

II. The authority to grant leaves of absence has been reserved to these headquarters, and no officer can properly order any one of his command beyond his own jurisdiction. When such an order is desirable or necessary, it must be obtained by application to higher authority.

III. Applications for leaves or orders for detached service, approved by subordinate commanders, have frequently been returned to the applicants to be presented personally at headquarters, and have by them been used without confirmation. Commanders and staff officers will send all such correspondence through the proper official channel, and are notified that applications sent in any other way will be rejected or not considered.

By command of General Bragg:

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
