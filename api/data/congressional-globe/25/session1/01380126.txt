adopted

Mi JOHNSON of Virginia, from the Commit-

adopted

ISfCttllRi  IN REÍ A1ION TO THE TI OlilTJA WAR
The House then pt iceeded to the unfinished bu-
siness of the morning hotn, which «asthe conside-
ration of thp following íesolution, submitted by
Mr  Wise on the 19th of September
Resolved, That a select committee be appointed i
by ballot to inquire into the cause of the Florida
war, and into the causes of the delaj s and failures,
and the expenditures which have attended the pro-
secution of that war, and into the manor of its
conduct and the tacts of its history generally, that
the said committee have power to send foi persons
ana pap°is, and that it have power to sit in th° le-
cess, and that it make repon to the next session of
Congress
Mr GLASCOCK had moved to amend the foie-
going resolution, by striking out all alter the word
"resolve,"and insert the following
" That a select committee be appom'ed to mqune
into the cause of the Florida wai, and the causes of
theeUiaorduiaiy delays and failures, and the ev-
penditure-. which have attended the prosecution of
the same, and all the facts connected with its historv
gcneialli, and thai said ci mmittee hat c power to
send for persons and papers "
The qu-stion immediately pending, was the
motion of Mi Howakd to strike out the words
" that a select committee be appointed,"and insert
" that ihe Committee on Militaiy Aliairs be m-
Mueied "
Mr MoKAY, who was entitled to the flooi,ad-
diessed the House at jnme length in opposition to
the adoption of the resolution He opposed the
laismg of this select committee, because ihe sam<
subject was now under mvestigition m various
ways It had been referred to the President of the
United States who had caused an inquiry to be m
stunted, and had made a report in part, an 1 he un
derstood void I probtblv leport in full at the next
ession of Congress Beside- this, the chairman
of the Committee on Indian Affairs (Mr Bell) had
moved to hav e this subject referred to that commit-
tee, and aftei a lengthy, and no doubt arduous
un estimation, the papers had been reponed back
to the House without coming to any conclusion
theieon He presumed, however, that, at the
commencement of the regular session, the (hair-
man of that committee wmldmove to have the
subject again referí ed to thatcommittee and proceed
wuli the investigation He could not, therefoie
seethe necessity of raising this select committee'
because it was befois ihe Resident of the United
States, who had appointed commissioners to invis-
tigate the matter, and the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr Adams) had admitted that thev had
performed their duty faithfully, so far as thev
went, anl laid before the House mfoimalion
of   which,   to   use   Ins   own   expression,   had
made the blood tingle in his veins They will
doubiless lay the whole proceedings before the
House at the next session of Congress In relation
to the caus°- of delays and failures of the cam-
paign, it wnl be recollected that an inquiry w as in
stituted by the President at Frederick, at which all
the officers engaged in the frst campaign, Scott,
Game*, and Clinch, were fully examined, and the
court came to the conclusion that the failures and
delays of the campaign were in consequence of the
insalubrity of the climate, the impregnability of the
swamps, and the absence of all know ledge of the
lopography of the country by the commanding
generals,, and the difficulty in transporting supplies
fir the army from one point to another Here,
then, at this tribunal, all the causes of ihe failures
of the campaigns conducted by Genera's Gaines
ard Scott were examined into, and it certainly
could not be designed by the House to tnstitu'e an
inquiry in relation to the conduct of the present
commander m Florida, (Gen Jesup,) at a tune
when he was just preparing and organising his
forces for another campaign It would Certainly
be impioperfor the House to mierfeie with thu.
campaign before there was an opportunity of doing
any thing w ith it It would be intending with the
legitimate duties of the Exei utive to send an inves-
tigating commitu e, with power to send for peisons
and papers, into Florida, and by so doing, the whole
of the benefits to be derived from the approaching1
campaign might be set aside Mr McK next referred
to the remarks of the gentleman from Tenneesee,
(Mr Bell,) who had stated that the probable causes of
failures of the campaigns in Florida had arisen from
the deficiency in Ihcnumberofofficer-connectedwuh
| the army m Flouda He admitted that there might
be some justice in this remark, but said the subject
had already attracted the attention of the President
of the United States, and referí ed to an order
issued as early as October last, directing all officers
of the army on detached service to join their regi-
ments and compame-, in which order the President
had said that this state of things must no longer
exist If any notice was to be taken of this mat-
ter, however, by this House, it was the legitimate
business of the Committee on Military Affairs to
take charge of tt, and If hoped they would take
the matter under consideration In relation to the
subject of ccpenditutes, he admitted that they had
been verj large, amounting, he believed, to about
seven millions, but he could see no necessity ol
appointing a select committee to take charge
of this subject, when we have committees ap-
pointed under the rules whose special business
it was to take charg  of these subjects He
alluled fo the Committee on the Expenditures
of the Executive departments, all of whieb
committees he believed were composed of rmjnu-
ties opposed to the administration The Commutee
on the Txpendituies of the War Depirtment should
take this subject inn consideration, and rejioitupon
it Mi M< K concluded by moví lg to postpone
the fuilher consideration of the resolution until the
first Monda} m December next
Mr WILLIAMS, of North Carolina, hoped
this motion would not prevail If a committee was
to be appi mted ai all, it ought to be appo.nted at
the present sess on of Congress He doubted n *
lfacomrmtlte was appi mted, it woul t oecupv
then attention duung the whole of the coming ses
sion of Congress He trusted the reso'ution would
be adopted, and the committee appointed at the
present session of Congre s
Mr ADAMS leplied at some leng h to the argu-
ments of the gentleman from North Carolina, (Mr
McKay') It the gentleman's argument was good
for any thing now, it would just be as good at the
commencement of the next session of Consiess It it
w as improper to appoint a committee noiv, it w ould
jnsi beasimpiopei then He contended tnat the
subject being referred to the Piesident was no n as  
why this committee should not be appointed The
reading of the report made by ihe President pioved
the necessity of a topting this le-olution. If he had
had any doubt about the matter, that repoi t w ould
have confirmed him, and inclined him to vole for
the resolution In relation to the subject being re-
ferred to the Committee on Indian Affairs, he be-
lieved that mquir) had now ceased to exisi, and if «
