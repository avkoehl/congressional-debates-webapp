HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA, Dublin, January 31, 1864.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

There are indications of another movement of the enemy from the Kanawha. A force was at Raleigh Court-House yesterday and scouted to Pack's Ferry. They were also examining obstructions from Lewisburg to Gauley. I think it highly probable these are only to engage my attention in front, whilst a cavalry force moves from the Kanawha through Tazewell, or from the north by Callaghan's. In either case it very important to have troops on this railroad.

I again respectfully urge that General Wharton's brigade be ordered immediately within this department and on the railroad.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

(Same excepting last paragraph, to General Lee.)
