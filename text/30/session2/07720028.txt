APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[Dec. 2,
30th Cong.....2d Sess.
Report of the Postmaster General.
Senate & Ho. of Reps.
The expenditures for the year have been in- !
creased by the following items, which do not |
properly belong to it, viz:
The sum allowed J. L. Graham, for fitting up the
New York post office, by the act of the 14th of
August, 1848  #49,787
The amount paid the Bremen line of steamers
since the 1st of July last, and charged in the
accounts of last year    33,333
The amount paid to postmasters as extra commis-
sions since the 1st of Januaiy, 1847, by the act
of the 17th of May, 184$, was $J 12,213 44, two-
fifths of which should be deducted from the
expenses of the present jear  44,885
128,0U5
Which makes the expenses properly chargeable to
the past year, §4,198,845. This includes also the
sum of §,100,000, paid the Bremen steamers during
the year, while the income arising therefrom is
reported to be $29,082 83. It is, however, per-
ceived, but too late for correction for this report,
that the postages on. mails to and from England
and France, are in part or wholly omitted.
This exceeds the expenditure of the preceding
year $227,535, and falls short of the annual average
expenditure for nine years preceding the 1st July,
1845, $800,748.
The gross revenue arising from postages and fines, excluding
those arising from miscellaneous sources, as well as the
$2 )0,000 appropriated for the postages of the executive
departments,for the year ending 30th June, 1848, amount-
ed to  $4,117,761 |
From the samei sources the year preceding...... 3,832,689 j
Increase.................................. 285,072 |
Making $7 43 per cent, increase. {
If the revepue from the same sources shall increase during j
the pjesent jear at the rate of six per cent., the proceeds i
Will be #1,364,826 !
To this mav be added the amount due trom the j
treasury lor mail services from 4th March, 1847, >
to 30th June, 1849, appropriated by 12th section j
of act of 1847  465,555 :
This statement of the operations of the act of
1845, upon the service and finances of the depart-
ment, confirms the opinion expressed in my last
annual report, " that the present low rates of post-
' age will not only produce revenue enough to meet
* the expenditure, but leave a considerable surplus
1 annually to be applied to the extension of the
< mail service, or would justify a still further re-
' duction of the rates of postage.''
Notwithstanding the great increase ofthe service
during the last year, inland as well as foreign,
there was found, at the close of the year, a surplus
of $172,232 beyond the expenses properly charge-
able upon it.
Accompanying this report, marked B, will be
found that of the-Auditor for the Post Office De-
partment, made at my request.
The energy and zeal of the officers engaged in
the collection and disbursement of the funds of
the department, as well as the punctuality and
promptitude of postmasters in making payments
and settling their accounts, deserve the highest
commendation.
It appears that from the first day of July, 1845,
until the 30th of June, 1848, the revenue, exclu-
sive of the annual appropriation of §200,000, for
services rendered the Government, amounted to
$11,538,614. The whole has been collected except
the following sums:
Of the amount due 30th June, 1846, the sum of..... .$6,162
" « " 1857, « 5,056
" " 1848, " 26,714
Means applicable to the present year  4,830,381
Leaving a surplus over the estimated expendi-
tures for the current year  428,336
If the revenue for the year ending 30th June, 1850, shall in-
crease at the rate of five per cent, upon the estimated rev-
enue of 1819, ihe amount will be $4,583,068
Add surplus of 1849    428.335
Annual appropriation for postages of Government 200,000
Estimated means for 1850  5.211,404
Expenditures properly chargeable on the year
1848    $4,198,845
These will be increased during the present year
by the following items:
Steamer from Charleston to Havana, three quar-
ters  -  37,500
California and Oregon agent  3,200
Additional railroad service and agents  37,500
Ship Hermann, belonging to the Bremen line ... 100,000
Miscellaneous  2.5.100
Expenditure for the year 1849    4,402.045
Estimated means of 1849  4,830 381
Surplus..
428,336
The estimated expenditures for 1849 $4,402,045
This sum will be increased for the jear 1850 by
the following items:
Service on newpost routes and railroads  100,000
Two additional neameis on the Bremen line.... 200,000
Charleston and Havana service,'one quarter, not
included in 1849  12,500
Additional appropriation for Florida    5,000
California and Oregon agency for Ave mouths, not
included in 1849  2,300
Miscellaneous.   25,000
Estimated expenditures of 1850..
Estimated means of 1850 
4,746.845
5,211^407
Surplus for 1850   464,562
There has accrued to the Post Office revenue,
under the 12rh section of the $ct of 3d March,
1847, the following sums, to wit:
From 4th March to 30th June, 1847  $65,555
Do do 1848...'  200,000
Do do 1849   200,000
Estimated surplus 30th June, 1849.
465,555
428,336
37.219
It will be seen, that notwithstanding the very
large sums estimated for foreign service, as well
as the additional service required in the United
States, the revenue of the department, unaided by
the appropriations of that act, will be equal to the
expenditure, except the sum of $37,219, at the
close of the present year.
$37,932
More than half the sum reported for the last
year will be probably collected within the next
three months.
The balance yet due is less than one-third of one
per cent, on the whole amount.
The last year's accounts have been generally
collected without a resort to the courts of justice.
Suits have been ordered in ninety-one cases, involv-
ing only the sum of $3,27]; whilst, during the
same period, one hundred and eight cases, formerly
pending, have been settled, and the money paid,
amounting to $10,655.
This large sum collected within the three years,
has been disbursed without the loss of a dollar, in
payment of the public creditors, in due and proper
time, it is believed, without an exception.
Prior to the 1st of July, 1845, there were debts due
the department, many of long standing, amounting
to $319,880. Of this sum there has been collected
within the past year $10,809, and credits allowed
upon the settlement of accounts of $51,710, leaving
yet a balance due the department of $257,361. A
very large proportion of this sum will be probably
lost.
.The present rates of postage will afford ample
means to meet the expenditure and probable in-
crease of the service,^and leave a surplus that will
in a few years enable the department to repay the
treasury the amount received from it since the
passage of the act of 1845.
Under these circumstances, shall a further reduc-
tion of the postages be made? The means which
a well digested cheap mail system affords of a
rapid interchange of ideas between different and
distant sections of the country, and the consequent
increase of knowledge; its influence upon society,
but little, if any, less than that of printing ; its im-
portance to every interest, social, commercial, and
political, would justify the answer, that a lower
rate of postage should be adopted, if it can be done
without a departure from that principle heretofore
maintained in the country—that this department
should be sustained from its own resources.
A system so intimately connected with all. other
interests, and the happiness and prosperity of the
people; so diversified in its operations, so minute
in its details, requires a careful examination of any
suggestions for its improvement, and the adoption
of such only as experience proves will be useful to
the citizens, and render it more perfect.
The importance, as well as a general desire for
a cheap postage system, has attracted much of
public attention to the subject, not only in this but
other countries, within the last few years. To
secure this, object in most countries, it is placed
under the control of the Government, though, per-
haps, not strictly one of its attributes. Had it
been left to private enterprise, the more wealthy
and populous portions ofthe community would, no
doubt, have been amply provided for; but others,
less favored, would have been left destitute of the
means of diffusing intelligence among the people.
Of so much importance was a well regulated
system esteemed by those who framed the Consti-
tution of the United States, that even the States
were not permitted to have any control over it, lest
the diversity of legislation should destroy its uni-
formity and regularity, and impair its usefulness.
It may, indeed, be questioned whether a free gov-
ernment over such extensive territories as those of
the United States could be maintained without it.
The perfection of every such system consists in
the cheapness, speed, and security, with which
communications are interchanged between differ-
ent and distant portions of the community, or
betweensdifferent nations.
Whatever may be the system adopted, the means
for its support must be paid in some way by a tax
on the people, for whose benefit it is established.
In the United States, upon this point, there has
been little or no diversity of opinion. That it
should be collected of those who enjoy the benefits
of the system by a charge on the matter conveyed
in the mails, is so obviously just, as ^scarcely to
have been questioned. It does not seem either
just or fair, that those whose condition in life does
not enable them to participate in its advantages,
should be called on by other modes of taxation to
contribute to its support. The revenues arising
from it have not heretofore been applied to any
other purpose, except for a short time during the
war of 1812; nor have the revenues derived from
other sources been applied to its use, except to a'd
in the effort recently made for its improvement. It
has been made to depend upon itself, and thereby
giving to the Government the best security for the
faithful administration of its finances. Perhaps no
other means could be adopted more equitable and
just. .
A large number of the people have little or no
connection with the mail system. To subject that
class to share the burden of its support by a direct
tax, or by imposts levied upon the necessaries of
life, would meet, it is believed, the approbation of
but few disinterested citizens. If this be the cor-
rect principle, of which the undersigned has no
doubt, every letter or package conveyed in the
mails should pay a just and fafr proportion of its
cost of transportation, and other expenses attending
the delivery. There should be no exception. Any
departure from it would unnecessarily increase the
amount to others who were taxed for its mainte-
nance.
If the Government does not seek a revenue from
it other than that necessary for the support of the
system, no higher charge'should be made than the
cost of transportation, and the expenses attending
the delivery of each letter or package. It is diffi-
cult, if not impossible, to ascertain with any degree
of accuracy, the actual cost of each letter or pack-
age conveyed in the mails. In a country like ours,
extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and
from the Lakes to the Gulf, one portion of it cov-
ered with cities and villages, demanding daily and
double-daily mails, with every facility for speed
I and cheap transportation; others sparsely popu-
lated, without any improvements whatever, scarce-
ly requiring a weekly mail,—the cost of transporta-
tion must necessarily vary, and change as often as
new contracts have to be made. In no two sections
ofthe country—probably on no two mail routes—
would the cost of transportation be the same. A
short time since, the mail was transported daily
over one route 74 miles in four-horse post coaches
at the rate of five cents per annum. On other routes,
similar service will cost from $50 to $2,000. In all
such cases, the cost of each letter or package must
depend, in some degree, upon the amount paid the
contractors. The contract changes every fouryears.
and the price for the service depends upon consid-
erations connected with travel over the route, the
chances of competition, the cost of supplies, &c.,
as well as upon the distance. The expense of re-
ceiving, forwarding, and delivery, will slightly in-
crease the cost of each, according to the distance it
is conveyed, or the number of persons through
whose hands it must pass; but neither of these,
nor all of them together, will more affect the cost of
each, than the number conveyed in the mails, and
