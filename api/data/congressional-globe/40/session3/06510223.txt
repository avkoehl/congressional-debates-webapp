present it would be desirable. The mode I
propose would, I have no doubt, be sustained
by the country. I have not indicated, Mr.
Chairman, in what I have said what plan*I
would recommend in order to hasten a specie
resumption other than by contraction of our
paper currency in case it was deemed expe-
dient. I have carefully read many of the plans
proposed, and have become thoroughly con-
vinced that any attempt of the kind would
under existing circumstances be disastrous to
the country.
The next great absorbing question is in re-
gaid to the national debt and how it is to be
liquidated. The last statement furnished by
the Secretary of the Treasury is as follows:

From which it will be seen that our national
debt on the 1st day of February, 1869, is put
down at $2,550,205,058 08; but that includes
$52,017,000 six per cent, bonds issued to the
Pacific Railroad Company, in which the Uni-
ted States are made secure and the company
punctually pays the interest thereon. Deduct-
ing the amount of these bonds, our national
debt at that date was $2,504,188,658 08. This,
though large, is not discouraging when we take
into consideration the vast extent of our coun-
try, immense resources and population, com-
pared with that of other countries.

From the foregoing statement it will be seen
that our population is greater than that of
either Great Britain or France; that our na-
tional debt is considerably less than that of
France, and some twelve hundred millions be-
low that of Great Britain, while the extent of
our country leaves them both in the shade, as
it is seen we have a country containing four
million square miles. It is estimated by a
French gentleman, who has made it his study,
that the financial losses of our late war was as
follows :
The northern States 23,500,000,000 francs
The southern States 11,500,000,000 francs
which, in the aggregate, is equal to about
seven thousand million dollars. In addition to
the destruction of values by the war nearly a
million able-bodied men were killed or per-
manently incapacitated for industrial pursuits,
and hundreds of thousands of dollars in value
were consumed by the armies, while they pro-
duced nothing in an economical sense. Yet,
notwithstanding all thi3, the wealth of our
country is great. It is difficult to estimate its
actual value at this time. It is said, however,
that it may be safely put down at $14,000,-
000,000: and according to the estimate of Com-
missioner Wells it should double itself every
ten years. We have in the United States up-
ward offorty thousand miles of railroads, among
which is thegreat line from Omaha to San Fran-
cisco on the Pacific coast of some two thousand
miles in length, and over sixty thousand miles
of telegraph, besides a line of communication
conveying intelligence with the speed of light-
ning across the Atlantic ocean to and from the
Old World.
We can pay the interest on our public debt
and the ordinary expenses of Government be-
sides applying something toward the extin-
guishment of the principal without excessive
taxation. It appears by the report of the Sec-
retary of the Treasury that the disbursements
by the War and Navy Departments between
the 1st day of April, 18G5, and the 1st day of
November, 1SG8, amounted to $630,481,125 90
for indebtedness growing out of the war. These
war claims are now pretty well paid, which
will very much limit our expenses. During
thefiscalyearending.IuneSO, 1868, ourreceipts
from customs amounted to $164,461,599 56.
During the same year the receipts from inter-
nal revenue amounted to 8191,087,589 41,
making in the aggregate $355,552,188 97. Mr.
McCulloch, the Secretary, has estimated that ;
hereafter the receipts from customs and in-
ternal revenue will amount to not less than
$300,000,000 per annum, and that our expend-
itures ought not to exceed the following figures:
For the civil service  S40,000.000
For the War Department  35 000.000
For the Navy Department  20,000.000
For pensions and Indians  30.000,000
For interest on the public debt  125,000,000
Making a total of. $250,000,000
which will leave an excess of receipts over ex-
penditures of 850,000,000 to be applied to the
payment of the principal of the national debt.
This would be reducing the debt fast enough,
for it ought not to be required of the present gen-
eration, that has done so much for the preser-
vation of the country, to discharge the entire
war debt: but those who come after us should
be allowed to bear a share of the burden, as
the entire war debt was about four thousand
million dollars, of which $1,500,000,000 has
already been paid besides immense sums paid
by corporations and individuals in the way of
bounties and contributions, thus leaving, as I
have before said, a balance of Government
debt of about twenty-five hundred million dol-
lars. This can easily be borne by a country of
the extent and resources of ours. If the
growth of the country should cause an increase
of taxation to meet the expenditures of the
Government our wealth would in a correspond-
ing manner increase the resources on which
the same rate of taxation can be imposed.
I trust the time is not far distant when what
is denominated "income tax," which is looked
upon by many as odious, may be removed, and
that sufficient revenue can be raised from cus-
toms and a reasonable taxation upon luxuries.
It is said that the debt of the nation is upon the
increase. It is true that there lias been some
increaseduringthe last year, but it must be re-
membered that we had a large number of old
claims to liquidate, besides $7,200,000 paid for
Alaska, and a large amount of bonds were
issued to the Pacific railroad. The latter, al-
though it tends to swell the debt on paper, ought
hardly to be counted in our indebtedness, inas-
much as the company is amply able to pay it,
and it is not at all likel-y that the United Stales
will ever be called upon to pay any part of that
liability. The mode of discharging the national
debt, as suggested by President Johnson in his
last annual message, is too absurd to be noticed.
It is nothing more nor less than encouraging
repudiation, and shows but alimited knowledge
in finance. What we want, Mr. Chairman,
in order to make our debt easily borne, is an
economical managementof our national affairs,
and the collection of the revenues strictly en-
forced.
There is another subject that I deem of vital
importance to the country, and that is a judi-
cious tariff for protecting and fostering Ameri-
can industry, and in some measure to prevent
the balance of trade from being against us, and
thus put a stop to such a large exportation of
our gold to foreign countries. I will not un-
dertake, Mr. Chairman, on this occasion to
discuss the importance of the tariff nor point
out the defects of the one now in operation, as
my views are well known and my State a unit
upon this question. I will therefore drop this
important subject with this passing remark,
referring to what I have said in relation to it
on other occasions.
The Thirty-Ninth and Fortieth Congresses
have had arduous duties to perform, among
which were the great reconstruction measures
that were deemed so vital to the life of the
nation, and which have been so vehemently
opposed by President Johnson, who lavishly
interposed the veto power. Happily, however,
for the country, both branches of Congress,
ha\ing more than two thirds of a Republican
majority, had the power under the Constitu-
tion, which they promptly exercised in passing
what they deemed wholesome laws over the
vetoes, which, as I have heretofore remarked,
when faithfully carried out, will afford peace
