Colonel J. G. PARKHURST,

Can you inform me how many prisoners of war have been sent in up to this date, including those from battle of Franklin and those enrolled in Franklin, Spring Hill, and Columbia hospitals?

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NASHVILLE, December 29, 1864

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

Whole number of prisoners of war reported to this office to date, including battle of Franklin: Commissioned officers, 557; enlisted men, 7,873; making a total of 8,430 prisoners-this does not include the prisoners captured at Murfreesborough. There are probably 250 prisoners there, but I have no official report relative to them though I have called for it. I will give you rank of officers in written report. Good many deserters are coming in.

NASHVILLE, December 29, 1864

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

It is desirable to reopen the Northwestern railroad for some distance at least, for the purpose of securing the wood already contracted and partly paid for on the line of it. The expense, it is reported will not be great for the length we want reopened, and I respectfully ask permission of the major-general commanding to reopen what I thus find necessary.

Chief Quartermaster, Department of the Cumberland.
