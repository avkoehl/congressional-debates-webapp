Grant arrived last night, wet, dirty, and well. He is just going to reconnoiter an important position which General Smith has discovered at the mouth of Lookout Valley, and which will be occupied from here simultaneously with Hooker's occupation of Raccoon Mountain. This movement will probably take place within three days.

No demonstration from the enemy. Deserters report that Longstreet's men have all just received new clothing, and are going away, either up the river or to Virginia. Breckinridge's division goes with them.

There is good evidence that rebels are moving in large force toward Cleveland. Heavy railroad trains go up and light one return. No doubt Longstreet is now going to Kingston.

This army is unable to act for want of animals, but the movement will facilitate the opening of the Tennessee.

The movement of the enemy to our left has obliged Grant to order Sherman up toward Stevenson, leaving Memphis and Charleston Railroad east of Bear Creek unfinished. It is indispensable to be able to hold McMinnville and have force ready to march north to cover Nashville.

CHATTANOOGA, October 25, 1863-11 a.m.

Deserters who came in this morning report that Cheatham's old division, forming part of his present corps, is now at Charleston on the Hiwassee. It is also reported that 5,000 rebel mounted infantry have crossed the Tennessee above Washington,but this needs confirmation. I am going over to Bridgeport to observe General Hooker's movement to Raccoon Mountain, in which he has so far manifested a surprising unreadiness. The precise time for his advance is not yet fixed, but it will probably be to-morrow night.

Palmer's division moved from here last night on its way to Rankin's
