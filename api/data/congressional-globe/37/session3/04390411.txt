1863.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

of fiom two to four billions will be payable at once.
To perform it is a financial impossibility.
The substitute proposes to promise to pay none
but the interest for ten years, and then to pay
only $50,000,000 a year in coin, until the whole
is paid. This I think can easily be done without
raising the price of gold. We have seen by our
statement, that out of $50,000,000 to be received
in com from the customs, only £5,000,000 will be
needed for our foreign uses, and $18,450,000 to
pay the interest on the $275,000,000 already
sold, being together $23,450,000. That would
leave $26,550,000 of untouched coin per year.
This $26,550,000 may be permitted to accumulate
as a sinking fund for ten years, uniil the first
$50,000,000 becomes due. There would then be
$265,500,000. There would lie $26,550,000 left
from the $50,000,1)00 received fiom customs an-
nually towards the pi mcipal. The first payment
would, thfrefoie, take from the sinking fund
$23,450,000 to add to the $26,550,000 to make the
first payment; and so on for each succeeding year.
Befoie the sinking fund would thus he exhausted
about twelve payments would have been made.
The interest from the time the first payment was
made would decrease every year by tlie amount
of $3,000,000, and thus the annual duties on im-
ports, with the sinking fund, would pay the whole
debt contained in this bill in com, without buy-
ing a dollar.
1 believe these specie bonds would sell much
more readily than the lawful money bonds of the
committee.
I object to the payment of specie for interest,
as it sets the Government and the merchant in
competition, and puts them both in the power of
banks and brokers. Beside, it is a shame to use
one currency for the Government and another for
the people.
I object to all shoit bonds. They are a false
promise to pay at a given time, with a full knowl-
edge that such piomise is false. They sell much
losvcr than lon^ absolute bonds. I have hereto-
fore said enough about what I deem the absurd
deposit loan—borrowing money on interest, with
astipulation ne\er to use it. It effectually pie-
vents all conversion into the funded debt. Only
$23,000,000 worth of bonds have been sold since
the passage of that law.
Another giavo objection to the committee's bill
is, that it indefinitely postpones the resumption of
specie payments. No one supposes that the banks
will resume until the Government does. The bill
puts it out of the power of the Government to re-
sume at the end of twenty years. Indeed, it pro-
vides that at that time the §900,000,000 shall be
paid in lawful money. It very pi operly does so;
for up to that time every dollar leceived by the
Government in coin must be expended m payment
of interest, and huge purchases made beside.
Then, when two or three billions fall due, Gov-
ernment will not have a dollar of gold to pay them
with, and to purchase it would break Croesus.
Fifty years will not see resumption if this bill
passes. The substitute proposes gradual resump-
tion-in ten yeais,and full resumption in twenty
years.
How much better to receive the interest in legal
tender,which will answer all the purposes of busi-
ness now, and gut the pi mcipai in gold when you
come to leahze your capital, than to take and
dissipate the dubiety of nueie^t m com, and get
the substantive capital in legal tend< r,or whatever
else the Government makes money, possibly the
notes of a Treasury bank.
1 do not like the section taxing bank circulation.
I think this'is the wrong place to attempt to re-
form the currency. Better have a separate, well-
matured bill, or leave it until the Tieasury bank
bill is up. I think the taxation very unjust to the
country banks, and partial to the city banks. To
do equal justice, the ""deposits should be taxed.
They foun ie<d!y the circulation of the city banks.
Checks pass fiom hand to hand, arid from bank
to bank as a circulation, and are used for settle-
ment at clearance instead of bank notes; they tend
to inflate the cunency as much as bank bills. Take
the banks of Philadelphia. Their last week's

Mr. MORRILL, ofVermont. I would inquire
of the gentleman from Pennsylvania whether the
bank bill does not contain the same provision?
Mr. STEVENS. Thegentleman will notbnng
me into nny discussion of the bank bill.
Mr. TIOOPER. Will the gentleman fromPcnn-
sylvama allow me to answer the question?
Mr. STEVENS. Ceitainly.
Mr. HOOPER. I assure the gentleman from
Veimont thnt there is nothing of the kind m the
bill, but simply a tax of two perccnt. on cunency.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. A tax on the
circulation, but not any tax on deposits.
Mr. STEVENS. It seems to me, just as it
seems to evorjf man, to he a lobbery of the coun-
try banks, and a premium to the city banks. A
country bank with $300,000 capital, and a propor-
tional circulation, would have out £,900,000notes,
all of which, orneaily so, would be taxed. About
^700,000 would be taxed, being $l,*i,SOO. A city
bank would ciiculute $100,009 and escape taxa-
tion.
But you wish to force in the circulation. What
would be the effect on the Government? The
circulation of the Pennsylvania banks has gone
into Government bonds. All their capital is
$25,000,000, and they have invested in Govern-
ment stocks $38,000,000. Compel them to call in
then* circulation, and you oblige them to throw all
their bonds on the market. Piecisely so m other
States. 1 leave the House to judge whether it is
helping to sell Government bonds and raise the
price of their stocks.
The bill proposes to fix the 1st of April to as-
certain the amount of ciiculation. Anyone who
knows anything' about the business of Pennsyl-
vania can testify that our bank issues, at that time,
aie double those at any other time in the year,as
that is the great day for contracts. Oilier States
have the 1st of May. This section is too crude
to work anything but mischief.
I would not be understood as being opposed to
a proper system of repressing the excessive issues
of banks. But I desire to consider that question
in a separate bill. Perhaps the bank bill of the
Secretary of the Treasury, when so amended as
to enable State banks to cunio m under its provis-
ions, and gradually exchange their own notes for
a better secured and more uniform national cur-
rency, may command my support. They would
then better answer the purposes of one section of
my substitute, as the fiscal agents of the Govern-
mentand substitutes for the sub-Treasui y. This
can be done without the violent contractions which
the committee's bill will produce; and the use of
the public deposits will compensate them in some
measure for this buidensome tax. But do not
attempt this in this crude bill. My other provis-
ion is that a part of our debts shall be paid in
bonds, as a part of the contract. It is the fastest
way to sell them, and save the legal tender for
other purposes. As it would not do to lock up in
the sub-Treasury the surplus gold for' the ten
years, being $265,500,000, but it should be usetl
in the business of the country, I have provided,
that it shall be fairly deposited in State banks,
being amply secured, until needed to redeem the
bonds. They would bank on that, and release
the legal tender notes on which they now bank,
and these then would seek investment in six per
cent. Government bonds. When the Government
comes to withdraw the gold gradually to pay the
$50,000,000 a year, it will require from all the
banks but $23,000,000 annually, and not at all (lis-
tless them, ordisturb the interests of thecountry.
Thus during this war the banks will be strength-
ened and able to aid the Government,and shortly-
after peace is obtained will glide into the resump-
tion of spccie payments. Pass the committee's
bill, and I fear the youngest man in this House
will not live to see such resumption. The bill pro-
hibits the sale of any bonds under par, no matter
what the necessity. The substitute leaves it dis-
cretionary with the Secretary of the Treasury. I
should prefer a sale a fraction below par to the
issuing of more legal tender notes.
We have seen that to pay the annual interest,
gold must be purchased annually to the amount
of #130,000,000, besides the omitted debts before
specified. Where is that to be had ? The gentle-
man fiom New York, in his able speech, showed
that all the banks possess but $87,000,000. Where
will you find the balance? Sixty per cent, pre-
mium may bring it out from its vaults or from
foreign parts. 1 do not believe a lower price will.
Whichever way I view it, great evil seems to me
to be the consequence of the passage of this bill.
Mr. Chairman, 1 have done what I deemed to
be my duty, to warn the Hous€ against what I
verily believe to be impending dangers. 1ft have
failed to convince the House, and all these evils
should come upon us, although the country will
be greatly distressed and the war impeded, yet I
shall not despair of the Republic. Such is the
great wealth,the fertility, the irrepressible energy
of this great country, that she will be able to rise
from her prostration—like the fabled giant who,
when felled to earth, drew fresh strength from the
bosom of Ins mother—and hurl to destruction
all the rebels of the South, and all the traitors of
the North who, within this House and out of it,
are basely advising us to lay down our arms and
meanly sue for peace.
The CHAIRMAN. The bill will now be read
by sections for amendments.
Mr. SPAULD1NG. I am directed by the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means to move an amend-
ment to the fiist section, by striking out the word
" nine," on line five, and inserting in lieu thereof
the word <£ three;" so that it will authorize the
Secretai y of the Treasury to borrow, from time
to time, on the credit of the United States, a sum
not exceeding &300,000,000, and to issue therefor
coupon or registered bonds.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. SPAXJLDING. I am also directed by the
Committee ofWays and Means to move to amend
by inserting, after " $300,000,000," the words
" for the current fiscal year, and $600,000,000 for
the next fiscal year."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. SPAULDING. 1 am also directed by the
Committee of Ways and Means to move to amend
by striking out, on line nine, the word " the," and
inserting in hou thereof the word " a;" so that it
will read 11 bearing interest at a rate," &c.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. SPAULDING. I am also directed by the
Committee ofWays and Means to move to amend
in line ten, by striking out the word "of," and
inserting in lieu thereof the woids "not exceed-
ing;;" so that it will read:
Three hundred million dollars for the current fiscal year,
and .5:600,O00,OUQ for tho next fUcal year; and to issue
theretor coupon or regi'-teied bonds, payable at the pleas-
ure of the Government after twenty yoars from date, and of
such denominations not less than fifty dollars, a  he may
deem expedient, hearing interest at a rate not exceeding
six per cent, per annum.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. THOMAS, of Massachusetts. I move to
amend by inserting in line eight, after the words
'• from date,"the wordst£ in coin." I believe that
that is agreeable to what I suppose to be the under-
