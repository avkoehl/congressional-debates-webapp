■tan iing the question
Mr JVMfaSUN inquired if the jour nl contained the grounds

Would not make such a mo i in Ho was willing, theiefore,

petition, but uisis ed upon its bemj received, and acted on by
the IIj i  
Mi  LI \COLN ha 1 no objection to the correction the gentle

Mr CAMPtUil L,olSoutn Caro i la, baid, it appeared to him
that the j >urnal w is «imply a ret ard ol the pro< eedmgs of the
House, and that the mere uct of a g-ntleman's having stated
that be would, or woul'not, mike a pu icular motion ought
not to appear ou it It rirtamly would be, in his i pinion, ex
csedmgly irregular to make the common proposed
Mr lilO UPSON, ol South Carolina, observed that he had
intended to vote Hrihe molían ol the gentleman from Massa
Chuseits, but the remai fcs nf hu colleague were conclusive to

Mr CAV E JOHNSON observed, that this was a matter of
too hule iiiir-oiun. e u> occupy so much of the time of the
House; and he woul I, i lertfore, move to lay the whole subject

Mr EVERETT asked for the yeas and nays on the question.
Mr. IDVVd moved the indefinite postponement of the mo-
tion to suspend the rules
The CH AIR was of opinion that the motion of the gentleman
from Massachusetts was not in order, because, if it prevailed,
the effect would be that no motion to suspend the rules would

Carolina, [Mr Thompson] to suspend the rules, should prevail,

Mr CAMPBELL, of South Carolina, from the Committee of
Elections, asked leave to submit a resolution authorizing that
fomralwee to employ a cleric.
The motion not being in order hut by general consent, and
Mr STANLY ohj etmg, the resolution was not received
Mr HOFFMAN calle I or the special order, which was, the
lepnrtol the Committee on tin Rules nl the House
Mr AD VMS appealed to the Chaie whether the unfinished
business of yesterday, which was the presentation of petitions,
had not precedence over the special order Mr A re erred to
alormerd cisión of the Spbakbr, which he said was a case in
point, and bore him out in the question he had raised
The SPEAKER said thai his decision was, that a special or-
der, to have precedence over a class of business which, by the
rules of the House, has priority over it, roust have been made
special by a vote ottwo third*, but that a special order, made
such by a majority only, would take precedence over other bust
ness ol the same class, not made special There was a decision
of his predecessor, he said, that the unfinished business had pri
only over a special order
Mr ADAMS wi"he 1 the Speaker to make his decision on
the question now raised, so that it might be spread upon the
journal, and understood as the future rule of the House
Tha SPEAKER replied that, if it was the desire of the gen
tleman Irom Massachusetts, ha would put the question to the
House for lis decision thereon
Mr ADAMS said, that he had rather hare the decision of the
SPKAKSRthan of the House
The SPEAKER was of opinion that the special order, unless
passed by a vote of two thmls, had not priority over the un
finish d business of the day before If the gentleman fro m
Massachusetts insisted on the point of order raised by him,
the Ch im was constra ined to decide that petitions had priority
Mr AD VMS    I thank the Chair.
Mr GARLAND  ofVirgma, appealed from the decision of
the Chair, and addressed the House at some length on the ap
peal
Mr TILLINGHAST took the floor, and was proceeding to
discuss the question, when
Mr FILLMORE calVd him to order, and read the following
from ihe rules " All questions relating to priority of business
shall be deci led without debate "
The CHAIR stated the question to be on the appeal of the
gentleman from Virginia, when
Mr ADAMS called for the yeas and nays, and read the rule
of the House with regard to the presentation of petitions.
Mr HOFFMAN then stated that the report on the rules was
made the special order for today, by a vote of more than two-
thnds
Tub SPEAKER said he was just informed by the Clerk that
the special order was fixed for today by a unanimous vote—
therefore it woul 1 be necessary to reverse his decision, and call
up the special order
The report of the committee on the rules was then taken up,
and read by the Clerk
The amendment t > the 9th rule, making the vote of the
Spbvkeu conformable'o the tito voce principle which had
been ad ipte 1 by the House, in the place of the ballot system,
was concurred m
The amendment of the committeerto the 31st rule, proposing
to restrict deba e so as not to allow a member to speak more
than oace, without leave of the House, on a subject, "unless
he be the mover, proposer, or introducer, of the matter pending,
in which case he shall be permitted to reply, but not until every
member choosing to speak shall have spoken," being under
consideration,
Mr DROMGOOLE said he could/iot give his consent to this
amendment. He thought it smacked too much of the profes-
sion, and any one, from observing the effect of it, would sup
pose that a majority of the committee was composed of prac
using lawyers. It placed the rule on this ground that great
political questions here were to be argued in the same man-
ner as cases before a court of law, where the plaintiff's
council had the privilege of speaking tho first as
well as the last time He had another objection to
ihe proposed amendment It destroyed that equality of pri
vileges which ought to exist between all the members of the
nouse, one member being allowed by it to speak twice, while
all the rest we'e prohibited from speaking more than once The
advantage it attempted give to the mover of a proposition,
would be something like the effect ofthe old law maxim, " Id
ctrtum est quod certiim reddi potest " It would have another
effect By giving to the mover of a proposinon the privilege
of speaking twice on their own motions the House would be of
fenngn premium to induce gentlemen to make them, that they
might have an opportunity of making speeches on them, to
which no one could reply
Mr D thought it would be better to let the old rule stand as
it wss, givine to every member equal pnvil gis
Mr HUFFMAN replied to Mr D in defence of the amend-
ment
Mr CLARK moved to amend the amendment of the coirn-
mittec, so that the duration of any speech should not exceed
in hour He advocated the amendment he proposed on the
ground of economy of ths time of the House, wh ch was wasted
frequently to the injury of the public business by long speeches,
and contended tdat if the membeis would talk less and work
more, great benefits would result therefrom
Mi DAWSON moved to amend the amendment of the gen
tleman, by adding, " and that each member shall have the
liberty of transferring his hour to another, if he pleased " He
was, however, oppose 1 to a limitation m speech He thought
the more they spoke and the less they acted, the better it would
be for the countiy—that the people would remain in ignorance
as to the corruptions or Government, if debate should be con
fined to the limns which some aentlemen wished The time
had arrived when those who had talent should talk to the coun
try Thnugh lie believed that many dishonest ppeeches had
been made upon that floor—speeches for party purposes whu h
did not conta'n one honest sentiment—yet he was unwilling, on
that account, to put a restriction on debate as he believed that
the peoplecould always discern what wasriiht, and that which
was wrong E>ery member was entitled to ppeik, and he
hoped they would be permitted to speak, nnd leave the country
to decide who is who on that floor He believed debate was a
great conservative nnncipleofour Government
Mr THOMPSON, ofSouth Carolina, «aid he was in favor nf
the amendment ofthe gent eman from Georgia, [Mr Dawson j
if the amendment of the ge tleman from New York should be
adopted, and as it seemed to be the disposition of some to make
us appear in the most ridiculous light possible, he thought they
had better adopt another amendment to appoint timers, as they
do on the race courses, to decide when the hour had expired
lie ww understood tobe opposed (• the limitation of time.
Mr CLARK replied that this subject was not with him a
matter ol levity He was in favor of r striding the interim
nable debates which take pi ice in that limine within proper
noun Is, and prevent, as it hits done htretoloie, the exclusion
of pititioners liom ilieirdoms He did notaeree with the gen
tleman irom Gwircia, that the less business tley did, and the
more speeches they made, the better it would be for the coan-
try    He was ready to subscribe to the reverse of that opinion
Mr BIDDLE said the House was always disposed to get
upon suits on all occasions, but he hoped they would consider
this rule with great good sense, and come to a proper decision
upon it. His honorable colleage [Mi Sergeant,] he understood,
had introduced this amendment in committee,and was sorry that
he was not there to give his peculiar views upon the subject
He thouiht that no rule could be more eqiiuable than that
which allowed the mover of a proposition ihe right to reply
when his motives might be assailed and even the punciplo of
the proposition itself misstated He thought it nothing moro
than even handed justice that he be allowed the privilege to
place hnnsell righ*, an I, as it might he save his proposition lie
disagreed with the gentleman fiom Virginia [Mr Deomooole]
that this proposition smacked Ho much ol the piofession, and
thousht the practice in courts of ju tiee which ailmitte I right of
reply was a most pist rule of proceeding He thought the
proposition had been sufficiently debated, and, H in older
would mine the previous question
The CHAIR stated that the effect of the previous question
would be to cut off all amendments, and bring the House to a
direct vote on the amendment proposed hy the committee
The previous question hat ing been seconded by the House,
and the main qutstion ordered,
Mi LEWIS WILLIAMS demanded the yeas and nays on
the ador, ion of the amendment fthe committee, which were
ordered, and were, yeas 125, nays 73
The amendments ofthe committee to the 42d rule, making
"a mo inn tn adjourn, and a motion to fix the day to which the
House shall adjourn always in order and to be decided without
debate," was next taken up in order
Mr PLTRIKIN obiected to this amendment and toso muc
patching up of the ru'es, he ihought it weuld be much better
the House would enlorre what rules they now have He wa
in favor of condensing the rules into a small spnee, instead o
multiplying them into a large v lume Tins rule would uievila
bly cause much confusion to the business ol the House, and
consume more time lhan it wou'd save
Mr BR1GGS moved a verbal amendment tn the report of the
committee whtc'i the chairman [Mr Hopkins] aiceptid
Mr PETK1K1N was here proi eeding to tlmw that the adop
Hon of this amendment, making more puvileeed questions,
would have a tendency to retard the tiansaction of the busi
nessof the House, when hi-was mteirupted by
Mr STANLY, and called to order
Mr PI 1RIKIN 1 tm in nn'cr lie hoped the gentleman would
alwaysascert un whether he was himsrll in order, be oie he in
terrupted other gentlemen, an 1 tlumsht the Ilouae 0Ui,ht to
a lopt a rule to privet t insolent interrupiniis on every occa-
sion, by i ersons who did noteven understand lilequea'i<m be-
fore the House, or what tho gentleman he interrupted was
speaking about
Mi STANLY I never do, except when th<" gentleman
speiklng does not understand what he is speaking about him
self
Mr PETRIKIN" The interruptions of some gentlemen
were so frequent and so insolent that th y were scarcely wonh
noticing. Mr P having concluded his remaiks on the amend-
ment,
Mr C JOHNSON thought the gentlemen  ho were in favor
of I avmg the private business transacud, should look to tins
amendment lie believed the effect of it would be to force
questions to adjourn over from Friday till Monday, at the sacri-
fice of tha' r!a-.s of business which is usually passed upon on
Saturdajs    He, fir one, would ccitainly vole ogaliist it
Tl e question on this an endiu nt was about bi lug taken by
count, when
Mr PETRIKIN demanded the yeas ard nays, which were
oíde ed
Mr BOND did not think that the effec' of the adoption of
this rule wmld betosacr hce th" private business, as had been
contended by the gentleman from Tennes-ee He believed it
wou'd operate as favorablv upon that class of business as the
rule did as it now stood He was however in lavorol ama
jonty of the House having the power to adjourn the House to
anv nme it thought piojjti
The yeas and nays hiving been previou ly ordeieJ, were, in
the affirmant c W, neeatite 74
So the amendment wasalopted
The amendment to Hte 44th rule, so as to make the rule as
amender1 read as fo'lows
'The pieviousquestion shall he in this form, 'Shall the ques
tion bt nnwpiul' It ■•hall only be admnte I when demanded by

After some remarks bv Messis HOri'MAN, TILLING
