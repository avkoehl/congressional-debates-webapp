the muster-rolls of Colonel Lays's regiment, and papers filed by him before me, marked Exhibit Numbers 4.* On the 14th of April, by General Orders, Numbers 42, paragraph X, "all authority to raise troops for any particular command" was revoked. It was rumored, but not proven by any documentary evidence, that in all these companies deception was used to induce men to enlist, threats of conscription brought to bear, and that the recruiting officer represented himself as being invested with the authority of a conscript officer. In one case, that of Private S. C. Fleshman, of Captain Sessions' company, Colonel Powerr' regiment, if his affidavit is to be credited, his enlistment was procured by fraud, deception, and threats. I file it marked Exhibit Numbers 13.* Could the truth be ascertained, it doubtless represents a large class.

ILLICIT TRADE WITH THE ENEMY

Colonel Scott has been vigorously at work to repress. I regret to say, however, that evn in this his subordintates manifest the grossest ignorance of their duties. By General Orders, Numbers 43, current series, paragraphs V and Vi, "all property seized by revenue or military officers under the law regulating foreign trade was to be turned over to the nearest marshal of the Confederate States, to be held by him for adjudication, a receipt taken for it," and "no military authority shall presume to dispose of the property seized in any other manner than that prescribed in the foregoing regulations." There is no Confederate marshal in East Louisiana, and the captors have been in the habit of turning it over to the quartermasters; yet the law and the regulations of the War Deparmtne say expressly and peremtorily it shall be delivered to the nearest marshal. In some cases officers have so far ignored these orders and their duty as to appropriate the property seized and divide it. Such was the action of Colonel Frank Powers and his regiment in the case of Mr. Brown, marked Exhibit 18.* I inclose communications and correspondence of Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton, provost-marshal of the district, as illustrative of the difficulties the officers have to encounter. Your Excellency will perceive from the letter of Colonel Scott, marked Exhibit Numbers 6, that in his opinion the contracts with parties for the introduction of supplies for the army in exchange for cotton are not resulting advantageously to the Government, but being made the means of private emoulument. I respectfully recommend the appointment of a deputy marshal and Confederate commissioner for East Louisiana, and a rigid scrutiny of the conduct of contractors. I feel it to be my painful duty to lay before Your Excellency the particulars of the sihipment of over 2,000 bales of cotton by Mrs. Ada Ackland, fully set forth in the exhibit marked Numbers 19. The details of the transaction point with such unpleasant suggestiveness to officers at one time high in command in this district that I trust your Excellency will think I have fully discharged my duty in laying the evidence before you without comment or remark. In conclusion, I would respectfully state that in my opnion the district commander must possess the qualities united of a soldier and one well versed in the laws of the land and the acts of Congress, in order fairly and judiciously to hold the balance between civil and military authority.

I am, sir, with high respect, your obedient servant,

GEORGE B. HODGE,

Assistant Inspector-General.
