No. 15. Report of Lieutenant Thomas Arendell, Tenth North Carolina Regiment (First North Carolina Artillery.)

FORT FISHER, N. C., December 29, 1864.

COLONEL: I have the honor to reply to your questions proposed in your letter of yesterday, as follows:

Answer to question 1. On Saturday, the 24th of December, my company manned four 32-pounders on land face, one 32-pounder rifle and one 8-inch columbiad on sea face.

Answer to question 2. Only two guns on the sea face were engaged. On Saturday, the 24th, the 8-inch columbiad was fired only once, when she was dismounted, I think, by the recoil. The 32-pounder rifle was fired between eight and twelve times - shell altogether, except the one shot from the 8-inch, which was solid shot.

Answer to question 3. Sergt. J. Henry Johnson and private Daniel Vinson were wounded slightly.

Answer to question 4. The 8-inch was dismounted, I think, by the recoil. No other damage done.

Answer to question 5. There were four frigates, three monitors, and twenty-six other vessels in sight.

Answer to question 6. One shell from the 32-pounders entered the side of one of the large vessels, from appearances, and one struck one of the smaller vessels. Anything more I could not see.

Answer to question 7. No firing at night.

Answer to question 8. No one captured or killed on land.

Answer to question 9. Did not see any advance of the enemy by night.

Answer to question 10. The officers and men all acted calmly and bravely.
