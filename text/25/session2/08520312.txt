oh Ine District of Columbia, have reported to the
Senate a bill ti renew and extend tne ch liters of
the six banks of this Distnct, which ail expnc, by
limitation of law, on the fourth of July next If this
bill is rejected, d es any person pretend that these
banks o >ul(i, under any pretext, or by any device,
be permitted to continue io issue and reissue their
notes'? I have, also, reported, from the same com-
mittee, two bills granting further time to two banks
of this District, that stopped years ago, to wind up
their concerns I deemed it my duty, before ma-
king such a teport, to ascertain that the trustees had
been using due diligence in closing the concerns of
these banks, and especially in drawing in and can-
celling their notes. Had I have found that they had
been remiss in this duty, I ceitainly would not have
recommended further indulgence, and it would have
been the duty of Congress to apply the corrective,
and I ask, sir, whether any of these District b inks
aiemore directly and exclusively the cieatuies of
Congress than was the late bank of the United
Slates?
Tnei e phi be no doubt that this bill, the provisions
of which are applicable to allcompanies incorporated
by Conste«s, has grown out of ihe conduct of the
late Bank of the United Slates, and it does =cem to
me that if it could be forgotten for a moment that
that bank ever existed there would not be an ob-
jection, constitutional or otherwise, ti its passnge
No Senator Ins raised his voice in defence of the
conduct of the bank in regard to itsciiculation Oi
all sides of the Senate it is slid that it is objectiona-
ble, improper, and indefensible But, alas1 say the)
«  have no power to do any thing to pit vent or

Distticl Banks—Mr. Niks.
to the full extent which thp business and the wants
oí the people required
But he was not prepared to say that it would be
proper at this time to renew the charters of the ex-
isting institutions for twenty years The objection
in his mind to doing this, arose from the present
condition of the banks What is the condition of
these institutions? In common with other banks in
the country, they suspended payment a year ago,
and have been going on since issuing their notes,
without redeeming them. They have not resumed
paj rienl, and are now, strictly speaking, broken
banks They are now m a prostiate condition,
and having suspended paymen', vie can know
nothing of their real situation They ma) be per-
fectly sound and solvent, )et if the fact was known
*o be so, it would not remove the difficulty from
his mind These banks have all forfeited their
charters, they are existing without law, and in vi-
olation of law, and the question is, whether we shall
resuscitate them, and bring them into life, aftir
they have become defunct by thefown acl, whe
ther we shall íenew then charters for twenty yeais,
whilst they ltmam in this prostrate and suspendeel
condition? If we t'o this, will it not be to sanction
their suspension, and what is more, to legalize
their non resumption1 II is not necessary to e\-
aniine now the causes oí the siupenMou Whether
ihe banks suspended for a suflicient cause, and
whemer that was bn uf,ht upon themselves by then
over -otion aid mismin lgemcnt, oi byencum-
stances bryt ml their control, ho vv onld not now cc-
amin Thesp questio is lnve gone past, ind it
c rti nl is not n c-ss-irv to mquue into them on
th'S occasion
Si far as i «gains the banks in tins Distnct, he
was willme ti suppose tint they suspended in m
an imptnous necessity     But the question n >w is

and sanction their non lesuini lion
Sn, is the Sen lit p pared to do this'' Is it pre
nued to ¡i n 1 its influence   to prolong  the picsent
lie of ining ? Ihere aie two standards now
rus 1 o l if lesmnpiion, the other of non re-
sumption Will the Senate enlist under the latter,
and five its sanction to the violation of law and of
m nl ol ligition which belon s to this condition of
non pavmeut < n the part of the banks'
This quesu in may not be thought of gieat mi-
p( itaner, because it is confined to the District, and
cm have no general influence on the state of the
(Uireno) of the countrj Th" principle, however,
is no  thehss i npoitant  because  its   operation is
mated For ore, he would not consent to renew
the charter of an) bank, unios for a short time to
wind up its ail' rs, which was existing in violation
or law and of all moral obligat on lie was not
willing, foi any supposed net es ity or temporary
advantage, t) ac' in dis'egard of sound principles
t t legishtion He would in no way suict on the
luithu suspension of payment \y the bank Let
them lennic, perform their cl)lii,auons to the pub-
1  c, and iciiirn lo a correct cours" ol business, and
it vv i't then be in time to drciue on the renewal of
Iheir charters Mr N said he should prefer to
eontmue their chai ers, o i the condition of their
resuming pa)ment by a certain da), to the next
esoiun, w hen we could with more propriety act on
th que si on of a renewal for wenty vears II
thisceurse was not pursued, lie only groui I on
which he cculd consent to a rene val oí then c ia -
ters at this time was, that theie suoulet be nice rpo-

Senate.
not reflect upon it without the deepest mortification
Sir, the moneyed incorporations have triumphed
over the Legislatures and over the people, they
have subdued the public will, they have trampled
the laws under foot, and usurped the power  of le-
gislation Merely private corporations, the crea-
tures of the Legislatures, have bid defiance to their
creators, and declared themselvt-s indepen'ent of
all authority If they have not done this in form,
they have in substance, as they have assumed the
powei to decide when their own interests and the
public interests required that they should pay their
debts What if a number of merchants, who had
failed or stopped payment, should hold a conven-
tion to deciele when it would be expedient for them
to pay their debts, and when the public interest re-
quired them to do so? Would not such a t roceed-
ing be scouted as an outrage upon common sense
and common honest)?
But the banks hav e done this, tkey have assumed
the prerogative of declaung when their own inte-
rests and the interests of the public required them
to pay their debts They have established a sys-
tem of bank legislation, which has superseded the
legislation of the States They have held two con-
ventions, and what did they do? Why, the first
agreed to adjourn, and the seccoid fixed a day for
resumption, so remote that, instead of its bemg an
eflort to piomote resumption, it was an attempt to
prolong the suspension It must have been viewed
in this light by the banks ihemselves, for almost
immedi iiel), many of the banks set about the re-
sumption of pa) ment The banks in New York,
and some in all the Eastern States, have already
lesumed, although the bank legislature fired a lime
so remo t? as next January This business of re-
sumption cannot depend on any conventional regu-
lations All solvent, sound banks can resume
when they please, they can resume as well to day
as two or four monlhs hence Foreign exchanges
being elecidedly in our faver, and specie, instead of
going out of the country, is coming in in a flood
tide, and being no longer at a premium, any bank
which can pay in any thing can pay in specie.
But he did not propose to go into the question
whether the banks could or could not resume, or
when they ought to resume What he contended
was, that that was a questioa which belonged to
legislation, and not to the banks. It was not for
them to 'say how long their own interest, or ths
public interest, requirecl the suspension to continue
Their duty was the same as any other debtor, to
pay their debts the moment they were able to do so
With them it was a question of ability, not of ex-
pediency If there were any considerations of
public policy, 01 expediency, which demanded the
delay of the resumption, this belonged to the Stale
legislatures, and to Congress as regards this Dis-
trict But has a single State exercised this power?
Most of their legislatures have been in session
since the suspension of the banks, and he believed
there was not a State ia the Union that had passed
iny law for compelling the banks to resume
I payment, either immediately, or at any future
period A  t one, it would seem, that dared to
' coerce the banks into a performance of their obh-
I gations to the public The Leg slature of Massa-
chusetts has been m session the whole winter, and
has given much oí its attention to the subject oí
banks, the) have had some eight or ten broken
banks in their hantls, but, he beheved, they had
I done noth ng in regard to the present condition oí
i their banks, either to settle the question whether
they out,nt to resurr , or to subject these corpora-
tions to any restrict ons, or disabil ties, tending to
compel a resumpt on. Instead of this, he believed

pav <inj c einand tVnat was luis but giving a sanc-
t on to ihe suspension, and encouraging the banks to
! prolong it He belieied in Virginia the banks had
' been, 1-y direct legislation, justified and protected
in their suspension The same wis done in N«w
Yo.k for one year, which he believed expired this
day, which was the anniversary of t ie bank explo-
sion Bat the Legislature that has just closed its
session, refused to extend the time, which was a
tacit or aegative act coercive upon the banks,   J|
