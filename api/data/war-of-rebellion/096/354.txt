HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, February 2, 1865.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General:

No change in the disposition of the troops of this command since last report. Two guns of Batteries C and I, Fifth U. S. Artillery, have been moved out of old Fort Fisher and forwarded into the nearly completed bastions of the new work.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, February 2, 1865-7.50 p. m.

Colonel DUANE,Chief Engineer:

Do you intend putting a fraise around new Fort Fisher? In addition to it I wish you would have a wire entanglement. The two picket-lines are very close to the work, and driving away the enemy's pickets will bring on constant firing. The work in its present transition state is, of course, less secure than at any other time, and, if it can be done, I would like the fraise and entanglement put up without waiting for the completion of the parapets, &amp;c.

Major-General, Commanding.
