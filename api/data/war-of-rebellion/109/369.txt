General JOHNSON:

General McCook directs me to say that he is informed that the whole force of Liddell's brigade is in your front, and that he wishes you to have the advance brigade of your command posted with the greatest care, and your troops protected in every way against surprise in the morning. General Davis' two brigades are ordered to be in readiness to move to your support.

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

MILLERSBURG, TENN., June 25, 1863-4.45 a. m.

General CARLIN:

General McCook directs that you move up to the support of the Second Division with the two brigades of the First Division. General Johnson has been ordered to feel the enemy. It is not designed to drive the enemy out of the gap or bring on a general engagement.

Your obedient, servant,

G. P. THURSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

MILLERSBURG, TENN., June 25, 1863-7.45 a. m.

General JOHN M. BRANNAN:

General Garfiels' letter* of this morning stated that you would join General Thomas. General McCook has no instructions or orders to the contrary, and expects you to act upon the instructions you receive from the general commanding, independently of him, and upon your own judgment.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. P. THURSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

JUNE 25, 1863.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

I am directed by the general to say that the state of affairs at the front is now such that there is no necessity of keeping either of your brigades in readiness to move out at once. You can theretofore put it on the footing of the rest of your command.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
