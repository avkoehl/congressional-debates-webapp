wisconsin land grants..
Mr, POMEROY. I move that' the Senate
proaeed to the consideration of Senate joint
resolution No. 15. It is a joint resolution giving
construction to a land grant in the State of
Wisconsin. It will create no discussion. â€¢
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate,
as in Committee oftheWhole, proceeded to con-
sider the joint resolution (S.- R. No. 15) giving
construction to the acts of Congress granting
lands to the State of Wisconsin to aid in build-
ing railroads.
The resolution provides that it shall be law-
ful for the West Wisconsin Railway Company,
a corporation which is entitled by the acts of
Congress and the State of Wisconsin tot-hat part
of the land grant from the town of Tomah to
the Saint Croix lake, to make up any deficiency
in their grant from the vacant odd-numbered
sections falling within the indemnity limits of
the grantfor the branch road from Saint.Croix
lake to-Superior and Bayfield; but nothing in
this resolution is to be construed so to impair or
reduce in any manner the grant for the branch
road above indicated ; all lands to be conveyed
by patents to the company upon the same terms
and conditions as are contained in the acts
granting lands to the State, approved June 3,
1850, and the deficiencies and indemnities made
up, as t.he building of the road of the company
progresses, from any lands to which the company
may be entitled within the indemnity limits.
Mr. SHERMAN. I should like to have an
explanation of this resolution. As I under-
stand it allows the railroad company to go
beyond the limits of the grant.
Mr. POMEROY. No, sir; the grant was
given to a company with two branches. This
resolution allows one branch to take lands con-
tained in the limit of the other grant, provided
it does not lessen the amount of land which
the other road was entitled to under the act.
It is no now grant. It simply transfers from
one to the other an equal proportion. The
settlers having taken up more land on one side
than on the other, one branch did not get its
proportion. The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr.
Carpenter] is entirely familiar with the sub-
ject, and he will explain it further if the Sen-
ator desires any further explanation. That is
the way it was represented to the committee.
Mr. CARPENTER. The original grant was
made to aid the construction of a road from
Madison to Columbus by way of Portage-to the
St. Croix river or lake, and from thence to
Superior City and Bayfield, with the usual
provision that deficiencies might be made up
within fifteen miles of the road, and that was
afterward extended by a supplemental act to
twenty miles. Subsequently the grant was
divided tyr the Legislature of Wisconsin, which
division was approved by Congress, and given
to two separate companies. Now tie-fact turns
out tPbe that on the lower grant ttoe is &
