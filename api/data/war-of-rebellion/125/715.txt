RACINE, September 13, 1864.

The PRESIDENT, SECRETARY OF WAR, and

PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL:

Do not postpone the draft. The fear of a draft is greater than the reality, and is more depressing; besides, it will operate very unjustly upon those towns and counties which have exerted themselves to fill up their quota. It has an appearance of weakness, and is strong evidence of it. while pending, all fear it; when over, all who are drafted and go will be cured of their reluctance, and it is the best medicine in the world for sickly patriotism, and has been known to cure even copperheadism, while those who are not drawn are relieved from suspense.

Respectfully, yours,

J. R. DOOLITTLE.

GOVERNOR OF WISCONSIN,

Madison, Wis.:
