2g6                                      THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                       February it,
intended to be benefited by the bi!l The subject
had been brought to the consideration of the Hou e
by a memorial of the Leg slatuie of Illinois It
had been so-rie time befoie the Committee on the
Public Landi, fully matured, and a lengthy repoit
on the subject accompanied tne bi'l now under
consideration He hoped the LUÍ would be per-
mitted to take its usual comse—that it would be
read a second time and committed, and, together
■with the report, printed it wouid not be uifficult
to show the difteience between the ciass of troops
referred to by the gentleman fiom Norih Carolina
[Mr Wn liams] and those who were embiaced
in the provisions of the bill But he would not
puisue the subject at present, in the hope that
the bill would be suffered to take theusutl course,
and, that at the proper time, it woulu come up foi
discussion
Mr CLAY said the gentleman from North Car
olma [Mr Wiliiams] seemed deposed to treat
this measure most unceremoniously The pio
visions ot th  bill were ceitainly not so bhockm_r
as to requne its ms'antaneousi ejection The gen
tleman was wholly mistaken in ¡supposing thai tnis
bill would encourage ihe numeiou^ apphcatioi s
from other portions of the mihoa to which he had
referred for a airmlai bounty in lands I heie was
a most essential diffeience between the ordiraiy
militia men and that c ass of tioops embraced in
the bill The former geneially served bin three
months, and perhaps, in a single instance, & x
months, while (he laiter were bound to serve
twelve months, aid did serve for that penod
They seived as long as a portion of the regulars,
who received a bounty, as well as he recollected
He contended that the mounted rangers had an
advantage over the infantiy They were bound,
as he understood, to furnish their own horses,
arms, and provisions Nor had the foimerany
advantage ovei the regulai troops
Mr C said the House was not now called upon
to deteimme the merits of the bill The only
question was, whether the pioposi ion was so pal-
pably absurd ami monstrous as to cause the House
to refuse to entertain it at the threshold He was
not prepared to say how he should eventually vote
upon this meaauie Let it be evamined and
matured, and if it should be deemed proper, let
us (said Mr4 C ) not withhold from the merit
orious citizen soldier that which he may be justly
entitled to He hoped, therefore, thai the bill
would be read a second time and committed
Mr CHILTON exptes&ed a hope that a bill,
So meritonous in ks chaiactei, would not be so
cavaheily disposed of by íejectmg it on its first
readme     While he would be opposed to extend
ing the provisions of the bill to all those who were
engaged m the service durirg the  late war, he
would be extremely gratifiedhf those in indigent
circumstances, who had fought the battles of the
late war, could receive a bounty in land, for the
puipose of securing to themsehes,and their fami-
lies, a home, which they weie unable to purchase
The bill was not as explicit in i s character as he
could desire     When, however, it should come up
ultimately for consideration, the House could fash
ion it to suit its fancy, and at the same time do
justice to those who weie concerned     Mi    C
concluded by a warm enlogulm upon those who
were engaged in sustaining the honor and glory
of the nation in the late war
Mr VINTON was glad that the motion had
been made to re|ect the bill It was time for the
House to take care of the public lands ab well as
the other public property I his bill if he under
stood it, proposed to give a bounty in lands to
almost every person who was engaged in the
public service during the late war Lven those
who had lemained in the service ñ teen days, and
who were regularly dischaiged, would he entitled
to the proposed bounty Not only the rargets,
but the militia, were to be provided for He would
ask whether these rangers were promised any-
thing more than what they had íeceived ' Were
they not acquainted with the character of the ser
vice in which they were engaged> Were they
required to do any other service than that agreed
upon, and were they not paid according to con
tract' Upon what ground, then, could anyone
come here and ask, in addition to tne sum paid
these troops, that they should be allowed each a
bounty of one hundred and sixty acres of land
A onunty of one hundred acres of land was given
to the soldiers of the Revolution 1 lus, too, was
to be located in a savage wilderness The land
which this bill pioposeu to give wo lid be located
in the very heart of a rich and civiliz°d country
One nundie 1 auesof land thus located was woith
five times as mucn as t lat whicn Had been given
to the soldiers of the Revolution Was this just
or proper lie hoped the bill would be ímmed
ately rejected, foi the reasons assigned oy the gen
tleman from Nurth Caio mi, [Mi Wiliiams]
Let this bill be entertained and laid ovet to the
next session, and we should most absuredly have
thousands of petitions í i om the militia eng iged in
tne seivice dunng the last war, for the benefit of
its provisions He letened to t lesicuness whicn
p evailed amoi g the tioops at Norfolk duung tne
war He considered the dangers encountered at
that station, from sukness alone, as infinitely
gieater t lan those expeuenced by the mounted
i angers, who were engaged m a sei vice calculated
to invi0orute and strengthen thesystem Tot the
easons which he hid assigned, he trusted the
House would promptly reject the oill
Mr SPEIGH T viewed the motion of his col-
league [Mr Williams] as an unfortunate one
The bill had been reported by one of the com
mittees of the Hous>°,and we were called upon to
reject it, when many of us did not know what
#ere its details Ihe motion also operated to ex
elude all other necessaiy morning business He
tnoughi, the bill oug it to be commuted While
he was the decided advocate of the old states, in
legaid to their rights aid inteiests connected with
tne public doma n, still the'-e was no person more
ready to do entne justice to those brave men who
had served the country m the wild West Fie
would go one step fuithei, and make pro vsion
for the tioops stationed at Norfolk at the penou
alluded to by the gentleman fiom Ohio He
doubted whethei a e onion ot the public domain
could be better disposed of than by distributing it
among those destitute and meritorious individuals
who had,duung the late war, shouldered then
muskets and tlelended the countiy
Mi REYNOLDS remarked that there seemed
to him to be a view of this sulject which had not
been yet piesented to the House The General
Assembly of the State of Illinois addiessed a
memoual, piaying for a bounty, in land, to be
granted to the United States Rangers This me-
morial was addiebsed to the Congrebs of the United
States, and was iefeiied to the Committee on
Pul he Lands They have íeported the present
bill lleconeideied that a memorial, coming from
one of the fiee ard republican Stutes of this Con-
federacy to this honorable body, should receive a
difleient treatment Common respect toa State
would, in his humble opinion, guaranty a course
entirely diffeient If the Old Boy himself were
depicted in the bill, it should not be tieated in this
manner, and be rejected thus unceremoniously,
but as tne bill, and the subject matter of which it
treats, are just and right, it ought like other prop-
ositions emanating fiom a i espectable source, go
to the pioper committee, or take the ordinary
course
Is it right that the claims and petitions of citizen
soldiei3, who sustained in the war with Great
Britain the honor and character of their country,
be rejected withoutmvestigation' Citizens that left
their homes and families and enteied the service
of then country to fight its bat'les against the
enemy, should their claims foi a bounty in land
be thus treated in the Congress of the United States>
Citizens who,m sustaining the liberty, honor, and
prosperity of the country, had fought and bled
under the stnnes, such as we see presented before
us, ate their claims to be rejected in the Congress
of the United States without a heanng >
[Mr R referred to the United States flag, sus-
pended in the Hall of Representatives ]
Mi WILLIAMS, of North Carolina, (who
made the motion to reject the billon the first read-
ing,) begged to explain that he made the motion
under a rule of the House, which was recognised,
and did not consider it "disrespectful" to the
House, or to the claims, to make the motion
Mr REYNOLDS observed that he had not
thought, or treated, the honorable member from
North Carolina, or his motion, with" uistespect "
Nor did he consider him treating the soldier's
claim with disrespect He had been lnioimed of
his charactei, and he had no such notion ot him,
but he did sincieiy believe that the motion was
wioi g
Mr R would repeat thit, should tne claims of
the soidiei, who defended trie h )i 01 and ( haiaoter
of the ountry, and wno advanced its prosper! y,
be rejected without examination, we wi I net see
the brave soldieis so ready to vo'unteei then ser-
vices If then c'aims he rejected in this manner,
we may again 1 eai of burnings and the destruc-
tion ot proper y by the enemy This Capitol may
be visited igain with the fi e ot the enemy, should
the dumb of tne soldiers be rejected thus hastily.
If this t eatment be visited on the soldier, who
| will de*ei d the country'  If such couise be pui-
j bued, he leared he would hear, in anothei wai, of
I tue dcstiuction of the Capitol agan —a thing, he
hoped, whi^h ik ver would again take place     The
honorable   memoer   fiom   Ohio   [Mr    Vikton]
remarked, tha    the militia and other troops re
ceived the compensation which the Government
agreed to give them     Mi  R said, this may be the
notions of the gentleman, who has been raised
undei the rigid system of contiacts, wheie there
was no liberality observed      This was not the
course which was puisued by this House     A lib-
eral and generous policy was observed on all occa-
sions
Mi R would refer the House to various cases
brought befoie it, wherein more was asked than a
rigid peiformance of a contract Justice and
equity should be administered to all, whethei their
claims weie founded on a contract or not, or even
if the claim exceeded a contract, if it were just and
equitable Look at the claim of Kilgore, from
Canada, who claimed pay for more than a con-
tract He claimed pay for services far exceeding
a contract, and which contract it beemed to Mi
R was founded in treason Claims even of this
character were sobeilyand candidly investigated
m this House, and should not the present bill be-
fore the House receive the same consideration ■•
Should the bill be of the chaiacter represented
by the gentleman from Kentucky, [Mr Chilton,]
it still ought not to be rejected in this manner
The bill was intelligible and easily understood It
would not fall within the definition of metaphys-
ics, such as the gentleman [Mr Chilton] de-
scribed it, that neithei the speaker nor his audience
undeistood the subject which they were dis-
cussing
Ihe bill, if it was not right in formm substanc,
could be altered and changed to suit the views of
the majority of the House     Almost all bills ex-
perience changes and alterations in their passage
Tnis cou d be so changed as to make it right
The object of the bill was to grant a bounty in
land in proportion to the bounty which the sol-
diers of the regular army received This bounty
was to be given to the United States rangers, m
pioportion to their services, and in relation to the
bounties given othei troops
This is so reasonable, and at the same time so
just, that he could not believe the House would
reject it at all, but he hoped the House would letam
the bill, change it if necessary, and finally pass it,
so as to embrace all troops that served in the late
war, and give them a bounty in land in propor-
tion to their services, and in proportion to the
bounty given other troops
Mr C ALLAN said, let the merits of this bill
be what they right, the course proposed oy his
honorable friend from Noith Carolina was a very
unusual one The bill was brought into the
House in tne usual way, through the ordinary
organ, one of its standing comm ttees It was
evident that they were not then prerjared to act so
definitively as proposed, for no two members who
had addressed the House, understood the bill the
same way, and every one had given it a different
interpretation For himself, he was not disposed
to reject this bill without any consideration though
he was not prepared to say how he should finally
vote upon it The subject was an important one,
connected with a large class of meritorious citizens
of the country, and did not the House from day
to day, and hour by hour, patiently consider bills
involving the mteiest of single individuals, and
