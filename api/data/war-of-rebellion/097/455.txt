HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 2, 1865-8 a.m. (Received 8.05 a.m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Orders have been sent to Parke to hold all he has got to proceed cautiously in advancing. Wright, if Ord cannot penetrate, should not go too far forward until Sheridan has broken through or Humphreys or Ord. If he does he will be isolated. I have not sent him any orders, relying on his judgment and the fact of his knowing the operations on his right and left.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

Captain BARROWS,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

An officer just from Fort Rice reports that the enemy's line of works in front of the Second Division have been captured and are held. Have heard nothing from General Parke or staff. General Potter is mortally wounded.*

Major-General.

APRIL 2, 1865-8.35 a.m.

Major-General MEADE:

We have the forts next to Hatcher's Run on both sides. I think there until be no difficulty in Humphreys marching forward now, toward Petersburg or toward the retreating foe.
