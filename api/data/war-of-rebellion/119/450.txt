escape, and it should be a matter of certainty that they cannot. While I have the command I do not intend they shall, either individually or collectively.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. S. PIERSON,

Lieutenant-Colonel Hoffman's Battalion.

RICHMOND, October 31, 1863.

Brigadier General S. A. MEREDITH, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: In the roll of Confederate officers transmitted to me by you some time ago I find the names of three officers who, by the entries, have been already declared exchanged. They are Lieutenant Colonel Wharton J. Green, captured at Smithsburg, Md., July 5, 1862[3], and now confined at Johnson's Island; Lieutenant H. B. Garnett, of Campbell's battalion, captured in Greene County, Mo., November 3, 1862, and now confined at Norfolk, Va., and Captain J. W. Johnson, Fourth Mirrouri, captured in Howard County, Mo., December 29, 1862, and now confined at Johnson's Island. All three of these have been declared exchanged by the agreements between Lieutenant-Colonel Ludlow and myself.

There are many officers besides those on the rolls who are in captivity. They are not all confined in the prisons named in the rolls. You have others. Some of the officers to whom I refer are at Saint Louis, Nashville, Alton, and other places. At some future time I will furnish you with the names of such as have been reported to me. In the meantime will you cause to be prepared lists of such officers as are in confinement at Alton, Saint Louis, and other points?

Of course I only refer to such officers as are not already on the rolls transmitted. If proper inquiries are made, especially at Saint Louis, it will be found that there are also many hundreds of our men who have been declared exchanged by our agreements.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

RICHMOND, October 31, 1863.

Brigadier General S. A. MEREDITH, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: The Northern papers of the 23rd and 24th instant contain notices of the examination of Lieutenant Glassell, of the C. S. Navy, recently captured near Charleston, S. C., from which it appears that he was carried in irons from the jail in New York before the U. S. marshal. It seems that he was subsequently sent to Fort Lafayette, which you know is not now used as a place of confinement of prisoners of war.

I will thank you to inform me as soon as possible whether this statement is true. Will you also let me know the character of the confinement and treatment which this officer is receiving - whether he is inclose or solitary confinement, or in irons, and whether his treatment differs from that which is accorded to prisoners of war generally?

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

November 9, 1863.

I have no official knowledge of the manner in which Lieutenant Glassell was treated while in the hands of the provost-marshal at New
