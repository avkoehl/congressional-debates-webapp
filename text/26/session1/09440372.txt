Freedom of Elections—Mr. Watterson.
April, 184Q.
H. of Reps.
party, that he was frequently prosecuted for libels,
judgments obtained against him, he was broken
up, and had to emigrate. Yet, strange to tell, he
has become of late a great admirer of Jeflersonian
Republicanism < Such are the men who surround
Gen. Harrison, and have charge of hi- opinions—
who impudently tell the American people, if they
are not pleased with Gen Harrison's refusal to
make any "further declaration of his views," they
must attribute the error to them and "his immedi-
ate advi'ers."
Whilst, sir, my colleague is for gagging the
office holders, this Federal clique have actually
mailed the chief of the office seekers. Knowing that
his principles are in conflict with the best interests
of the country, they use him like a machine,
which never acts until it is acted upon. When
before did a candidate for the higest office within
the gift of a free people deny then right to interro-
gate him on all subjects of public mt^resi1 Gen
Harrison has virtually done so, by placing himself
in the hands of a confidential committee, who have
sealed his lips, and Instructed him "to he low and
keep dark" until after the election. Sir, if I had
no other objection to Gen Harrison under the
"lernatscm of God's heavens, this would be suffi-
cent. It should make every patriot deprecate his
election as the greatest calamity that rould befal
the nation.
But it is pre'ended that Gen. Jackson had a
similar committee. Not a word of this is true
He is not the man to be put in strings, and pulled
about like an automaton. He always gave his
opinions freely, when interrogated, he never was
afraid u ""take the responsibility" of saying what
he thought, and he ever thought what he said.
The Jackson committee at Nashville was se-
lected by the people, for the purpose of de-
lending his character agiinst the ruthless attacks,
the infamous slanders, which the Federal party
were propagating against htm—a thing he
disdained to do himself—and not for the purpose
'of hiding his views or speaking for him on a sin-
gle political question. No man upon the face of
the earth would scorn to have around him a "pack
of keepers," more than General Jackson. He is
made of different metal, and thank God for it.
Before and after his election as President, he ¡m-
swered every interrogatory put to him by commit-
tees or individuals, in his own proper name and
person.
I will now read the correspondence between
General Harrison's "thinkers" and the association
alluded to, and will make no further comments.
Let the country read and judge for them*ehe*.
Osweoo, J tníl, IStO
To the Hon William H Harrison
Usar Sir In accordance with a resolution of the Union Ass*
ciation of Oswego, 1 am msirucied to propose three questions
lo you, in relation to subjects that a large portion of this sec
lion of the country feel a deep interest in    The first is—
Are you m favor of receiving and referring petitions for the
immediate abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia?
Second—Are you in favor of a United State  Bink or some
institution similar to that, for the safe keeping and disbursing
of the public moneys, and for giving a uniform currency
throughout the United States?
Ana lastly—Would you favor the passage of a General Bank-
rupt Law, by Congress,—so that its operations might be equal
in all the States of the Union?
I have only to say, sir, that the above inquiries are made in
accordance with the unanimous wishes of this association, the
members of which, I am instructed to say, entertain the highest
regard for your past services, and hope, should you be elected
to the high office for which you are nominated, that nothing
may occur to lessen you in the estimation of a great and free
people
I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,
MILES HOTCHKISS,
Corresponding Secretary

Oswico Union Association
Gbntlembn Your letter of the 31st ult addressed to General
Harrison, has been placed in our possession with a view to
early attention This is unavoidable in consequence ofthe
very numerous letters daily received by the General, and to
which his reply in person is rendered absolutely impracticable
As from his confidential committee, you will look upen this
response, and if the policy observed by the committee should
not meet with your approbation, you will attribute the error
rather to ourselves and nis immediate advisers than Gen Har
lison That policy is, that the General make no further decla
ration of his principles, for the public eye, whilst occupying
his present positron
Such a course has been adopted, not for purposes of conceal
mem, nor to avoid all proper responsibility, but under the im-
pression that the General's views, in regard to all the important
and exciting questions of the day, have hei etofoif been given to
the public, fully and explicitly, and that those view , whether
$ontt«ct«d with corn utubona) or other questions of very general
interest, have undergone no change The committee are
strengthened in regard to the propriety of this policy, that no
new issue be made to the public, from the consideration that the
national convention deemed it impolitic at the then crms, to
publish any general declaration of the views of the great Oppo
sition party, and certainly he policy, at the present, remains
unaltered In the mean time, we cannot help expressing the
hope, that our friends, everywhere will receive the nomina
tionofGen Harrison with something akin to general confi
deuce When we reflect upon the distinguished intelligence of
the nominating convention—how ably all interests were repre
sented in that body, we certainly have a high guarantee, that
should General Harrison be the succeqsful candidate for the
Presidency, that office will be happily and constitutionally ad
ministered, and under the guidance of the same principles
which directed our Washington, Jefferson, and Madison Be
lievingyou will concur with us in the propriety of the policy
adopted, we have the pleasure in subscribing ourselves
Your friends ,

Mr. Speaker, a great deal has been said by the
Whigs about Gen. Harrison's pretended poverty.
For popular effect, they have denominated turn the
log cabin and hard cider candidate Sir, if you
could travel down the Ohio river and look at his
pnncely estate at North Bend—with a dwelling
more like a palace than a cottage—with two or
three thousand acres of land, worth from fifty to
one hundred dollars per acre, and surrounded by
every comfort that life can bestow, you would be
ready to exclaim, "if this be poverty, then I am
willing to be poor the remainder of my days "
Born of wealthy parentage, he never knew what
want was. And why should he? Ever since he
left his paternal roof, he has been sucking at the
Treasury pap—has bpen an office holder—an! has
pocketed from the General Government between
severity and eighty thousand dollars' I do not make
this assertion without being armed with proof, as
the official statement which I have will show. Let
it be read every wh«re.
