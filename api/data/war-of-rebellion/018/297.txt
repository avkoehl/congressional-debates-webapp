and stores unguarded, fled across the river, and Colonel Maulsby reported that he could not bring them back to duty. They are Maryland Home Guards, and ought all to be dismissed from the service in disgrace. General Slough has the post of honor. He commanded on the Virginia side, and will do all that can be done with such troops as he has. General Saxton commands on the Maryland side. General Banks is sending a force down the river to Antietam Furnace Ford to prevent the enemy from crossing above this place. In the course of an hour we shall be able to ascertain with more certainly the force of the enemy, and whether he is making a feint or attacking in earnest. The second gun is nearly in position.

HARPER'S FERRY, VA., May 30, 1862.

(Received 2.15 p. m.)

To the PRESIDENT:

The enemy's skirmishers in small numbers have approached very close to our outposts, but the main body appears to have retired. No attack will now be made, I think, by the enemy. Our forces are posted, one-half on Bolivar heights, on the Virginia side, where they are entrenching, and the other half on the Maryland Heights. The second large gun is mounted on the Maryland Heights. Heavy firing or thunder, it is not known which, has been heard in the direction of Winchester. The force we have here, although large in numbers, is unless for offensive purposes.

P. H. WATSON,

Assistant Secretary of War.
