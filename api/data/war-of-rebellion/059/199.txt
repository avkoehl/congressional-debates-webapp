By order of the Secretary of War:

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

KNOXVILLE, March 31, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The rebels have all gone from Bull's Gap, and are now beyond Greeneeville. They have destroyed the railroad bridge across Lick Creek and the trestle-work near the gap; they have also broken up the railroad to some extent and carried off the telegraph wire. This is all positive and I take it is conclusive as to Longstreet's designs.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

LOUDON, March 31, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

Why don't you send down to this place the pontoon bridge you had at Knoxville? It could save a vast amount of ferrying and hard work, and would par your stores rapidly. It will be some time yet before the railroad bridge is done, and I advise you to have the boats and cheeses floated down and made at once.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

KNOXVILLE, March 31, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

My pontoon bridge is not long enough to cross the river at Loudon. I will have it lengthened and put down there without delay.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, TENN., March 31, 1864 - 9 p. m.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL U. S. ARMY:

Am just down from Knoxville. Longstreet is doubtless moving out of East Tennessee for Virginia. General Schofield will occupy Bull's Gap with infantry and fill up the valley with cavalry.

Forrest was badly worsted at Paducah, and is still between the Mississippi and Tennessee. I hope to catch him and break him up.
