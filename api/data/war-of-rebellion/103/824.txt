HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF MISSISSIPPI,Memphis, Tenn., March 3, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Asst. Adjt. General, Military Division of West Mississippi:

The expedition ordered in cipher dispatch from the major-general commanding the Military Division of West Mississippi, of the 22nd instant [ultimo], marched at 6 o'clock this morning. Herewith I inclose copy of instructions given to the commander.* The rain has been falling in torrents for two days and a half, and is still pouring down with great violence. The two streams below here (the Nonconnah and Coldwater) are far over their banks, and the latter entirely impassable, so that a direct march to Grenada is out [of the question].

Respectfully,

N. J. T. DANA,

Major-General, Commanding Department of the Mississippi.

NASHVILLE, TENN., March 4, 1865.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

City Point:

I can spare the detachments of Fourteenth and Twentieth Corps with me. Shall I send them to General Sherman, and which way?

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, TENN., March 4, 1865-9.30 a.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

General Hobson's division will require to be entirely remounted, the horses belonging to it having been taken to remount the division which General Wilson takes with him. General Hatch should be remounted first. The horses which come in afterward might be divided between Johnson's cavalry, in Middle Tennessee, and Hobson's, in Kentucky.
