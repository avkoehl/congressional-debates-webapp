WASHINGTON, D. C., April 9, 1861.

Hon. L. P. WALKER:

The prices named for rifles and carbines are the lowest market, and in great demand. Probably they could not be had twenty-four hours hence. The powder mentioned at 20 cents is the best Government, and the highest-priced cannon-powder is cheaper. How much powder shall I order? Both arms and powder offered at prices paid by this Government.

JOHN FORSYTH.

MONTGOMERY, April 9, 1861.

Hon. JOHN FORSYTH,

Washington:

Two thousand Colt pistols; 2,000 Sharps rifles. The former at $25; the latter at $22. 50.

EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Montgomery, Ala., April 9, 1861.

Hon. L. P. WALKER,

Secretary of War:

SIR: Your letter of yesterday's date, requesting me to call for "3,000 volunteers, to be drilled, equipped, and held in readiness the most perfect," to meet any requisition from your Department, has been received. You do not specify the character of the troops whose services you anticipate may be needed, and I therefore beg leave to inquire whether cavalry companies will be received, and if so, how many.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. B. MOORE.

CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

Montgomery, April 9, 1861.

His Excellency A. B. MOORE,

Montgomery, Ala:

SIR: I am instructed by the Secretary of War to state that in his letter dated yesterday, making a conditional call on Your Excellency for 3,000 volunteers, he omitted to state the description most desirable for the service contemplated. He now desires me to say that the Department wished the whole force to be infantry, unless Your Excellency should be able to furnish two companies of artillery.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. J. HOOPER,

Private Secretary.
