The average yearly amount paid for pensions,
from 1791 to 1815, inclusive, was $80,000. For
the year 1816, $290,180 58 were paid ; iul8l7,
$570,711 69; in 1818, $959,443 59; and the
average from 1819 to 1831, inclusive, was
$1,092,300 per annum: from 1832 to 1841,
inclusive, §2,901,200; from 1942 to 1851,
$1,654,900; from 1852 to 1861, $1,332,300.
5. How paid :
Prior to 1816 the payments of pensions were
principally made through the commissioners
of loan9 in the several States. From the time
the United States Bank was chartered, in 1816,
till the expiration of its charter, in 1836, this
duty was required of it and its branches ; but
this did not prevent the appointment of some
one for this purpose in States or Territories
in which no bank was located. After 1830
pensions were paid by certain officers of banks
designated as depositories of the revenues of
the Government till the passage of the act of
August C, 1846, establishing the independent
Treasury, since which time agents have been
appointed for that purpose.
Since then the times for the payment of pen-
sions have been changed from semi-annual to
quarterly, but the amount is as I have stated.
It will be seen that this bill appropriates a
little more than was paid last year for pen-
sions, and, although it is conceded the pay-
ments will not increase, I am informed by the
Commissioner of Pensions that this is a neces-
sity, because they are compelled to have small
balances in the hand of almost every pension
agent. It can work no harm, because, under
the law we passed at the last session, at the
end of every fiscal year all balances on hand
are covered into the Treasury.
_ I have made this general statement in rela-
tion to pensions to call the attention of the
House to what we are doing. The amend-
ments I propose to offer I will move when we
reach that portion of the bill. I now yield the
floor.
The Clerk proceeded to read the bill for con-
sideration by sections, and read as follows:
For Army invalid pensions, and for furnishing
artificiallimbs or apparatusfor resection, or comimi-
tntion therefor, as provided by acts of April 24,1816,
May 13,1846, July 14,1862. June 6,1866, and July 27,
1868, and July 11, 1870, &),850,000.
Mr. KELSEY. I move to amend by striking
out at the close of the section " $9,850,000"
and inserting in lieu thereof ■' $9,550,000."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. KELSEY. I move to amend the para-
graph relating to revolutionary pensions by
striking out in line thirty-three, at the end of
*Mauy of these are remarks.
*1"This included over two years'pension from tho
time they were assumed by the General Govern-
ment, under act September 29, 1789.
the paragraph, " $19,650,000" and inserting
in lieu thereof " $19,000,000."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. ALLISON. I would ask the gentleman
from New York [Mr. Kelsey] what is meant
by the word " resection " in line thirty-seven?
Mr. KELSEY. That part of the bill follows
exactly the language of the law for furnishing
artificial limbs. It is put in this bill in pre-
cisely the same way as it was put in last year's
bill, m the form of a proviso. I move that the
committee rise, and report the bill to the
House with amendments.
The motion was-agreed to.
So the committee rose; and the Speaker hav-
ing resumed the chair, Mr. McCrary reported
that the Committee of the Whole on the etate
of the Union had had under consideration the
bill (H. R. No. 2529) making appropriations for
the payment of invalid and other pensions of
the United States for the year ending June 80,
1872, had made sundry amendments thereto,
and had directed him to report the bill and the
amendments to the House.
Mr. KELSEY. I call the previous question
on the bill and amendments.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered; and under the opera-
tion thereof the amendments were agreed to ;
and the bill, as amended, was ordered to be
engrossed and read a third time; and being
engrossed, it was accordingly read the third
time, and passed.
Mr. KELSEY moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
Mr. DAWES obtained the floor.
CLERKS OF COMMITTEES.
Mr. BENJAMIN. I ask the gentleman from
Massachusetts [Mr. Dawes] to yield to me
for a resolution which it is necessary to have
passed.
Mr. DAWES. I yield to the gentleman.
Mr. BENJAMIN, by unanimous consent,
submitted the following resolution; which was
read, considered, and agreed to:
Resolved, That the Committee on Accounts be in-
structed to inquire anil report to this House at the
earliest practicable period what committees should
be authorized to employ clerks, and the rate of com-
pensation to be paid to each; and said committee
shall be authorized to report at any time.
Mr. DAWES. I yield for a moment to the
gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. Welker.]
WASHINGTON DIME SAVINGS-BANK.
Mr. WELKER, by unanimous consent, in-
troduced a bill (H. R. No. 2583) to incorporate
the Washington Dime Savings-Bank of the
District of Columbia; which was read a first
and second time, and referred to the Commit-
tee for the District of Columbia.
PERSONAL EXPLANATION.
TheSPEAKER. ThegentlemanfromTexas
[Mr. Conner] has intimated to the Chair that
he desires to make a personal explanation,
and appeals to the gentleman from Massachu-
setts [Mr. Dawes] to permit him to do so.
Mr. DAWES. What time does the gentle-
man require?
Mr. CONNER. Only a few moments, not
to exceed fifteen minutes.
Mr. DAWES. I yield to the gentleman for
that time.
Mr. CONNER. Mr, Speaker, 1 rise to a ques-
tion of privilege, in reference to an editorial
article in the New York Tribune of December
8 upon the resolution I had the honor to intro-
duce on the 6th instant, providing for the re-
peal of the existing duties on tea, sugar, and
coffee. My first impulse after seeing the article
was to pass it by, or at all events not to dignify
it with a notice upon this floor; but as many
other leading journals have had something to
say upon the subject, I am constrained to ask
the iudulgence of the House for a few mo-
ments. 1 send to the Clerk's desk the article
in question.
The Clerk read as follows:
" A Rope of Sand.—Thefree-trade combination has
lost all cohesion. The third party movement was
seen to be hopeless before it was organized, and the
scheme of revenue reform was adopted in its place.
The reformers were to take possession of the House
of Representatives, and the perverted Republicans,
joining the solid mase of the Democrats, were to have
everything their own way. But when a movement
is set on foot whose very spirit and basis is demagog-
ical there is no predicting where it will end. Tho
free-trade agitation is founded in belief of the igno-
rance of the masses. The specious cry of monopoly
deceives no one who examines the question for him-
self. The delusive promise of cheaper goods is mis-
addressed to those who are too ill-informed to under-
stand tho cause and cure of their poverty. There is
a Democratic Congressman from Texas who has taken
thefree-trade declamations seriously. lie is ignorant
enough to show the blind prejudice and hopes of the
people who have elected him. lie thinks that na-
tional prosperity would come from an abolition of
the tariff. Mr. Coxner, this candid free-trader,
on Tuesday introduced a bill repealing the tax on
tea, sugar, and coffee. The childlike innocence of the
measure was not appreciated by the leaders of the
party, who do not believe in carrying out their own
principles where only the laboring classes are to be
benefited by it. The great English shipping interests
would gain nothing by this enfranchisement of the
farmer's breakfast table. SoMr.CoxNER got nothing
but black looks from most of his colleagues, and the
Evening Post of this city feels moved to administer
severe correction to the logical Texan and his sym-
pathizers : 'A great part of the Democrats, who
falsely call themselves free-traders, and revenue
reformers, appear to be in favor of this scheme,
which would simply make any honest revision of our
revenue laws, in the interest of the people and
against monopolies, impossible for a generation to
come.'
" It is not our fault that the Post has not learned
long since the true intention and purpose of its Dem-
ocratic allies. They attack the tariff, earing nothing
about the economic questions involved, simply to
make the payment of the debt impossible. There
is no genuine and enduring combination which can
be made between the British merchautsof New York
and the Kuklux politicians of the Southwest. They
may sometimes drift together in the easy immoral-
ity of election day, but they will have difficulty in
keeping step in the serious work of legislation. The
organization, the process of work, the purpose of
the Free-Trade League, are ail purely aristocratic.
They are pledged to the defense of powerful vested
interests of capital. The ex-rebels who send to Con-
gressmen of Mr.CosNER's caliber are actuated merely
by a blind hate of the Government, and a hope, de-
rived from the speeches of demagogues, of freeing
themselves from the burdens of citizenship by the
aid of their political alliesin the North. The super-
fine gentlemen who make the Post their mouth-piece
must not be too particular about the conduct of their
rural followers. You must fight on their terms or
give up the contest."
Mr. CONNER. The remdrksofthe Tribune,
although literally flattering to myself, are really
intended to convey the notion that my resolu-
tion was offered in ignorance, "childlike inno-
cence' ' it is called, or in violation of some com-
pact expressed or implied between the Demo-
cratic party, to which I belong, and a league of
free-traders or revenue reformers, having its
headquarters in New York, to which I do not
belong. If these assumptions and remarks
were well founded they would place me in a
ridiculous position before the country. I would
appear to have trespassed beyond some essen-
tial line of policy concerted and fully under-
stood, though not published, between the Demo-
cratic party and the Free-Trade League—tres-
passed in "childlikeinnocence," blunderingly
and without seeing the point.
Mr. Speaker, I see the point clearly enough,
and have seen it all along. I am quite as well
aware as the Tribune is, that, according to the
protective theory, my resolution, if passed, to
abolish the duties on tea, sugar, and coffee,
will have two results, both of them apparently,
but not actually, in the interest of protection.
First. ' To render the remaining customs
duties now existing relatively higher.
tiecond. To render them more permanent,
and even susceptible of practical increase.
But I am also aware of what the Tribune and
the whole protection party seems not aware of,
namely :
1. That in this country, by reason of its free,
institutions and mobile population, all protect-
ive advantages are but ephemeral in their ten-
ure, and being doomed to speedy extinction
are not to be weighed with the other and more
important consequences of tariff changes.
2, That the whole contest between protection
