McNeil with about 100 men crossed the river last night and robbed several stores in Old Town, fifteen miles below here; did no damage to the railroad; retreated this a. m. They will strike at some point west of this, no doubt, next.

Got here safe; all quiet here. Big scare at Big Cacapon when we got there. Second lieutenant and eight men all that remained on this side. Captain and balance crossed the river. They had heard that 300 rebels were near there. We left twelve of our men to take care of them till our return. All quiet at Sir John's Run and Sleepy Creek. We will go back to Great Cacapon in few minutes and will report from there.

General KELLEY:

The rebels crossed at McCoy's Ferry yesterday. They made directly north; they were in Mercersburg last evening at 6 o'clock. They then went to Loudon, twenty-five miles north of here, and cut the telegraph about 8 o'clock last evening. No news from them since. Number not known; report to be some force. It is the general opinion that they are making for Chambersburg. This news is brought by Jonathan Hees, from Pott's Mills, twelve miles north of here.

McNeill crossed the river below Old Town and robbed several stores at that place last night. Have your scouts out. What do they report? You must keep yourself fully posted in regard to McNeill's movements, or your command will be all gobbed up some
