BEVERLY, W. VA., May 8, 1864.

Colonel N. WILKINSON,

Orders one section of Maulsby's battery to proceed at once to Beverly and report to Colonel Harris. Advise Harris.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

NEW CREEK, May 8, 1864.

General B. F. KELLEY:

General Sigel inquires whether the order for four guns of Keeper's battery to be sent to Clarksburg had been received and carried out. I answered no such order had been received. He also says that all the troops on line of railroad and in front of that line, form Parkersburg to Sleepy Creek, are at my disposition, with discretionary power as to their disposal, looking to the defense of the railroad and interior parts. These dispatches are dated yesterday. Their tenor, in my opinion, settles your command as all on or off the instead of Maulsby's to Beverly? The former is, I learn, at Webster.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel.

CUMBERLAND, May 8, 1864.

Colonel WILKINSON,

New Creek:

I did not know that Keeper's battery was at Webster. Yes; send a section of it to Beverly.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
