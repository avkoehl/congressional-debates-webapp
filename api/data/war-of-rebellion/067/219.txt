The hospitals of the Second and Fifth Corps remained stationary throughout the battle. Those of the Sixth Corps were collected on the night of May 6 and moved to the vicinity of Dowdall's Tavern on the Fredericksburg turnpike. This removal was necessitated by a fierce attack of the enemy upon the right wing, which forced back and threw into temporary confusion the Third Division of the Sixth Corps. Some shells were thrown into the vicinity of the Spotswood house, injuring two ambulances, but doing no further damage. The records of the various hospitals were, as a general thing, carefully and accurately kept. The hospital of the Second Corps being but a short distance from the front, the influx of patients was so rapid and their numbers so great that it was not possible to record all of them. About 120 of the enemy's wounded were brought in, chiefly to the hospitals of the Second Corps. The total number of wounded, killed, and missing during this battle is shown by the following statement, which, however, does not include the loss of General Burnside's command:

Number of wounded, according to classified returns......... 7,302

Number of wounded treated in hospital unrecorded (estimated) 1,000

Number of wounded who fell into the enemy's hands (estimated) 800

Total...................................................... 9,102

Number killed, according to regimental reports............. 2,009

Number missing, according to regimental reports............ 3,893

Total...................................................... 5,902

Grand total................................................ 15,004

The number of wounded, according to the regimental returns, is 10,185, or 1,045 more than is given above, but subsequent returns render it probable that this is an error. A consolidated statement of the wounded of this battle is appended, together with a return of wounded officers. It will be noted that this number is large, 1 to every 16 enlisted men. This was due to the fact that the conflict was in many respects skirmishing on a large scale, and the men most conspicuously dressed were the first victims. For a similar reason the Zouave brigade of the First Division, Fifth Army Corps, whose uniforms are banded with red and yellow scrolls, met with very heavy loss. The relative proportion of killed was also large, being nearly 1 to every 5 wounded. Only 240 wounds from cannon shot and shell were observed. As a somewhat interesting fact, bearing upon the character of the conflict, it may be mentioned that but 11 rounds of ammunition per man were used by the army during the three days' fight, as stated by the chief ordnance officer.

Ample supplies of all kinds were on hand in all the hospitals. The medical purveyor, with his wagon train, was at Woodville Mine, and reported that he was ready to issue by 5 p. m. of May 5, but no requisitions were sent in as the supply carried in the ambulance and field hospital trains was much greater than the emergency required. All of the ambulances and hospital wagons were at the several hospitals by 9 a. m. of May 6. The labors of the Ambulance Corps during this battle were very severe. The ambulances of the Fifth and Sixth Corps traveled about 50 miles on the 6th of May. Every
