GENERAL: The detective who was sent by Colonel Sanderson to hunt up the O. A. K. matter last summer reports to the provost marshal-general this morning that the head of the order in this State issued orders for certain members to meet in this city on the 14th; that there war work to be done; that the plot extended to other

parties, including officers in this State. We are trying to ge at the merits of this report. He also states that several of them left this city on Saturday. I send you this, as I get it, for what it is worth.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, April 17, 1865.

Major-General DODGE:

I am satisfied that if the rebels are not prevented from concentrating in Lafayette, Saline, Cooper, and Jackson they make a great deal of trouble north of the river. More cavalry is wanting in these counties. Have you not some four companies of Fourteenth ready? Colonel Giddings' new regiment, eight companies infantry, is at Saint Joseph. If ordered to Lexington, Waverly, and Miami they could guard the crossings of river.

THOS. C. FLETCHER.

Major-General DODGE,

Commanding Department of the Missouri, Saint Louis, Mo.:

GENERAL: Major-General Pope directs me to say that he desires the 2,000 Canadian ponies, now being delivered at Fort Leavenworth, to be held at that place until further orders form him, as he intends them for service in the Department of Arkansas, and does not wish any of them to be issued at this time. Please acknowledge.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. PLEASANTON,

Major-General, Chief of Cavalry and Artillery.

BLOOMFIELD, April 17, 1865.

Major BARNES:

Rebel forces reported 2,000 at Jonesborough, Ark., under Thompson; presume for the destruction of the forts here. Some without arms. I am ready for artillery. The hired hands here are suffering for want of blankets. Captain Hipple, assistant quartermaster at Cape Girardeau, refuses to send. Please order him by telegraph to fill my bill by next train, which is to leave the Cape to-morrow.
