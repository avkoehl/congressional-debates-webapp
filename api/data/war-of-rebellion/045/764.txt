HAGERSTOWN, MD., July 24, 1863.

Major-General COUCH,

Commanding Department of the Susquehanna:

GENERAL: I inclose Colonel Franklin's report, * which does not put so gloomy a face on matters as was yesterday given in conversation sought for that purpose. He then stated that the colonel of one of the regiments had come to him, and informed him that the regiment would refuse to go on picket, and that the command was generally dissatisfied with the detention here. I informed him that since he had expressed the opinion that he could not depend upon any regiment to force the refractory one to its duty, I would, at any time he desired, send for a couple of McReynolds' regiments to enforce obedience. I also asked him to report the whole matter to me in writing, that I might forward it to you. It had not reached me when your note came last night. I have ordered the "emergency men" of the cavalry to be sent to Chambersburg. Very respectfully,

WM. F. SMITH,

Brigadier-General.
