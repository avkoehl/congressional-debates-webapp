HEADQUARTERS BRIGADE,July 17, 1864.

Captain J. W. LABOUISEE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your last dispatch, and to say in reply thereto that my mounted pickets were driven in this morning. The left of the mounted pickets rested on the river about one mile and a half above where the dismounted men are posted, and their right connects with General Williams. Their left was turned. The enemy's pickets were doubled during the night, and drove in mine this morning. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the localities picketed to answer the general's question definitely. Will ascertain, however, and report more definitely as soon as practicable.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. FERGUSON,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. ROSS' BRIGADE, JACKSON'S CAVALRY DIVISION,Glenn's House, Ga., July 17, 1864-7.45 p. m.

Brigadier-General JACKSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: All is quiet along my position of this line, except occasional picket-firing across the river at and above Green's Ferry. I think the force in my front must be mounted infantry. Their guns are of the longest range, but their men show no knapsacks nor anything that indicates regular infantry.

I am, general, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.
