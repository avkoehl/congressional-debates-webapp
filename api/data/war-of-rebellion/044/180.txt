around by berryville to cut me off from Martinsburg; their object being to get the stores from here, from which they are suffering. I have no cavalry for scouting, and am helpless. If I am to hold this place, my force should be doubled. Please order to Washburn from Romney here with my artillery, and a cavalry force, to come up through Berryville .

GENERAL SCHENCK'S HEADQUARTERS, Baltimore, April 26, 1863-11, 30 p. m. (Received April 27, 12. 15 a. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.:

General Milroy sends the following:

WINCHESTER, April 26, 1863.

Major-General SCHENCK, Baltimore:

I have just received a message from General Elliott at Lost River, 5 miles beyond Wardensville. He found the river too high to cross with his infantry and artillery. Sent on a regiment of cavalry toward Moorefield ; says he cannot cross his infantry and artillery without bridging, and he has not tools to build a bridge . I think before he can cross, Jones will have escaped. What do you say to having Elliott go from Wardensville to Woodstock, then up the Valley to Harrisonburg, to head Jones off? I think it would be best to turn Leopold over to the civil authorities of Maryland . Shall I do so?

R. H. MILROY,

Major-General .
