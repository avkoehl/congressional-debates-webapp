Our line in Kentucky is very weak, and being threatened at many points. Thus far we have been able to maintain it, and the enemy have not been able to make any very considerable raids. I have sent out two important expeditions, the object of which will be made known to you by a bearer of dispatches, who will leave here to-night. I shall move all available force in Indiana and Ohio down to the front.

CINCINNATI, June 16, 1863.

Brigadier-General STURGIS, Lexington, Ky.:

Order all the fragments of regiments at Lexington into and around the fortifications there. Report at once what arms you have to give them. There are arms here we can give them, if you cannot supply them. Place quietly inside the fort fifteen or twenty days' provisions for 1,000 men. There is no cause for alarm, but it is well to be ready.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
