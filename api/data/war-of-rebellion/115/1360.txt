First Lieutenant, Ninth Infantry, Commanding Post.

BALTIMORE, MD., February 11, 1863.

Colonel W. HOFFMAN, Washington.

DEAR SIR: I went to Fort Monroe, Va., as directed, to report to Lieutenant-Colonel Ludlow for exchange, but did not find olonel Ludlow to report in person. The marshal informed me at about the time the boat was leaving that Colonel Ludlow hadgone away, and that I must return to Baltimore, there being no accommodations at Fort Monroe. I have reported my case to Marshal McPhail here, who will undoubtedly be able to inform me in due time when the next ruce boat is to leave Fort Monroe, but having unavoidably come short of your specific directions in not reporting in person to Colonel Ludlow, I deem this explanation proper. Any further directions or orders you might see fit to give that would expedite my movements homeward I do assure you, sir, would be most highly appreciated.

Very respectfully,

WM. H. CHILD.
