that Rosser and Imboden were to accompany him. If this is true, the force capturing the train was the advance of Early. Thoburn advised Mulligan he would leave Petersburg at 2 a. m. for New Creek; if he did, I fear he is cut off. If Early is coming into this valley I may require more infantry for a few days. If so, be ready.

Brigadier-General SULLIVAN,

Harper's Ferry:

A dispatch from Milligan advise me that Thoburn evacuated Petersburg last night, and is safe with men and material. Early's forces attacked and shelled his camp and works at daylight this a. m. The rebels burnt a large portion of the train. It is rumored to-night there is a rebel force in or near Romney. I fear they intend to cut the railroad and telegraph below here. As Thoburn is safe, you will send a messenger to-night and direct the officer in command of your cavalry to go from Wardensville by the Grassy Lick road to Romney, instead of Moorefield. By that route he will be able to protect the railroad better, and will be within striking distance of my force.

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, January 31, 1864-11 a. m.

Colonel MILLIGAN, Ridgeville:

Colonel Thoburn's dispatch was dated before he was aware our forces has been attacked. Can he find any road to reach the west side of Knobly without encountering Rosser's force? I send the old Ringgolds on a scout up Patterson's Creek. They will reach you this evening. Have ordered four mounted regiments to move, by way of Winchester and Wardnesville, toward Moorefield.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, January 31, 1864-4 p. m.

Colonel MULLIGAN, New Creek:

I presume you are aware there is a road from Williamsport to Ridgeville along east base of Knoby Mountain. This road you will give your personal attention. I also suggest you send an infantry scout on Knobly with instructions to get a good lookout and report to you as soon as any force shows itself in the valley above Burlington. Maulsby's battery is on the way to you from Clarksburg.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, January 31, 1864-4 a. m.

Colonel OLEY, Martinsburg:

Colonel Thoburn's wagon train was attacked and captured yesterday after a severe fight. We lost about 80 men killed and wounded.
