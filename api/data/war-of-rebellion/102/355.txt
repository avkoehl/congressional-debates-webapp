Brigadier-General SANBORN:

You must get your troops into a position that will strike those bands working north. Some five bands have reached Central Missouri; sacked two towns and murdered several citizens, and the first knowledge we get of them is their appearance on the Pacific after traversing the entire State of Missouri. Put every mounted man you have to work. I have ordered six companies on the Osage from Rolla.
