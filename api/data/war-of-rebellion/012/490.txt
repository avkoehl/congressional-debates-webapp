No. 22. Report of Major Francis Price,jr.,

Seventh New Jersey Infantry.

CAMP SEVENTH REGIMENT NEW JERSEY VOLS., May 12, 1862.

SIR: I have the honor to make the following report supplementary to my report detad May 7, of the loss of the Seventh Regiment New Jersey Volunteers in the action before Williamsburg, Va., on the 5th instant:

We were ordered, on our arrival upon the field of action, to take up a position in the woods on the left of our batteries and repel and attempt of the enemy to flank our position. We entered the wood shortly after 8 o'clock in the morning, and immediately formed in line of battle on the left of the Sixth Regiment New Jersey Volunteers, the Eighth being upon our left. Two companies from the right, under command of Captain Louis R. Francine, and two from the left, under command of Captain Henry C. Batlett, were deployed as skirmishers, the former to the front and the latter to the left of the regiment.
