command encamped near Falling Creek. It crossed Falling Creek at 7. 30 on the ensuing morning. At noon it reached a point near Cox's Bridge over the Neuse River. My command crossed the Neuse at 2 p.m., and having moved one mile beyond, encamped for the night. At 2 o'clock on the morning of the 24th all the pack animals and headquarters wagons were sent forward to Goldsborough in obedience to an order from Major-General Slocum. The troops were notified that they would be expected to pass in review through the town upon their arrival there. My brigade marched at 7 and crossed Little River at 9. 30 a.m. At 10. 30 it reached Goldsborough and moved through and three miles beyond the town, where it went into permanent camp near its present situation, in the vicinity of the Weldon railroad.

During the campaign which thus terminated my brigade marched 494 miles. It captured from the enemy 60 prisoners, of whom 2 commissioned officers and 52 enlisted men were well, and 1 commissioned officer and 5 enlisted men were wounded. It destroyed 5 miles of railroad track, and two cases of new Enfield and Springfield rifle muskets, containing 60 in all.

The troops of my command subsisted mostly upon the country. They captured 500 beef-cattle, 200 sheep, 2,000 live hogs, 15,000 pounds of flour, 20,000 pounds of meal, 1,000 bushels of sweet potatoes, and 100,000 pounds of bacon, besides vast quantities of poultry and miscellaneous provisions. The command burned 50 cotton gins and presses, 1,800 bales of cotton, 2 saw-mills and 3 flouring mills. It captured 200 horses and 350 mules. The animals of my command were also chiefly subsisted upon forage obtained from the country. The quantity gathered for and consumed by them was, as nearly as it can be estimate, 125,098 pounds of corn and 77,340 pounds of fodder. Besides these there were vast numbers of miscellaneous captured of articles valuable to the enemy.

I have the honor to append a complete list of the casualties during the campaign.

I also forward herewith the reports of my regimental commanders.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
