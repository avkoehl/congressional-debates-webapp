Governor MORTON,

Indianapolis, Ind.:

The guns for your batteries are on the way, if they have not reached you already. The gun carriages raced Saint Louis last night. Three complete batteries were to be shipped to-day at Saint Louis.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

CINCINNATI, September 4, 1862-11.15 p.m .(Received 10 a. m. 5th.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

The Austrian rifles sent here are of the most worthless character. One regiment to which they were issued one week ago has already returned over 400 as utterly worthless, and the best cannot be depended on. Competent men have examined then and say they are not worth $2 apiece, taking the average. The men have no confidence in them whatever, and it is a very great hardship that men should have to go into the battle with them. I do not want to go into the market to buy arms, but I am unwilling to sent our men into the field with such guns.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor.

You are authorized to commission any officers that you deem qualified for the service, being yourself responsible to your own people if you place them under command of unfit officers.
