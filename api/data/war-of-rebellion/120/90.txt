HEADQUARTERS FORT DELAWARE, DEL., April 26, 1864.

Colonel WILLIAM HOFFMAN,Commissary-General of Prisoners, Washington, D. C.:

COLONEL: Previous to the arrival of rebel officers at this post you inquired how many I could accommodate, and I replied 1,500, thinking that the prisoners from Johnson's Island would be sent here and occupy all the old barracks, but, as you have only sent 335, they necessarily occupy these barracks to the exclusion of about 2,000 enlisted men, the great majority of which class will probably be taken in the impeding battles, and if you desire to have them kept separated I respectfully suggest that either all the officers be removed to another depot or none but officers sent here after filling the new barracks, which will accommodate about 1,000 more enlisted men.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. SCHOEPF,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,Fort Monroe, April 26, 1864.

MYERS, Esq., Her Brittanic Majesty's Consul, Norfolk, Va.:

SIR: I have the honor to reply to your note of the 23rd instant by inclosing a report of my provost-marshal upon the subject as furnishing you with all the information in my power.

As fast as we can examine and find out about these men we discharge them.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

Commanding Department of Virginia and North Carolina:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that of the 126 prisoners received on March 13 from the navy, reported as captured on the blockade-runners Don, Scotia, and Mary Ann, I have up to this time released 95, leaving 31 still in my custody. The examination of those remaining is progressing, and as soon as it can be shown satisfactorily that they are subjects of a foreign power they will be released.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN CASSELS,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp, Provost-Marshal.

FORT MONROE, April 26, 1864.

Colonel HOFFMAN:

Because of the exigencies of the service I was not able to send the Essex back to Fort Delaware - she having been sent to Fort Monroe by Major Mulford - so that the sick and wounded there will have to remain for the present.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
