charge the Committee of the Whole House on
the Private Calendar from the further considera-
tion of the bill for the relief of John J. Michie.
Mr. BOUTWELL objected.
RELEASE FROM DRAFT.

sons called into service for one hundred days by

COMMISSIONER OF TUUI-XC BUILDINGS.
Mr. RICE, of Maine, asked consent to intro-
duce a bill fixing the salary of the Commissioner
of Public Buildings at $3,000 per annum.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I object.
Mr. RICE, of Maine. 1 desire to say that the
Sresent salary of the Commissioner of Public
uildings is but $2,000. He has a very large
amount of business to transact and a large re-
sponsibility to incur, entirely disproportionate to
the salary, j hope the gentleman will withdraw
his objection.
Mr.' ELDRIDGE. I cannot withdraw it.

MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE.
A message from the Senate was received, by
Mr, Forkist, then-Secretary, notifying the House
that the Senate have passed a joint resolution (S.
No. 78) providing for the appointment of a com-
mission upon the subject of raising revenue by
taxation; in which he was directed to ask the
concurrence of the House.
Also, that the Senate have passed without
amendment a bill (H. R. No. 32) to regulate the
sessions of the circuit court of the northern dis-
trict of New York, and for other purposes.
DIRECT TAX IN REBEL STATES.
Mr. FENTON. J rise to a privileged question.
I report hack, in accordance with the permission
given by the House to report at any time, the bill
of the Senate (No. 171) further to amend an act
entitled " An act for the collection of the direct
taxes in the insurrectionary districts within the
United States,and for other purposes," approved
June 7, 1862.
The bill was ordered to a third reading, and
was accordingly read the third time.
REVENUE COMMISSION.
Mr. MORRILL. Before the vote is taken on
that bill, as it may disclose no quorum present,
I desire to take from the Speaker's table the joint
resolution (S. No. 78) providing for the appoint-
ment of a commission on the subject of raising
revenue by taxation.
The joint resolution was read. It authorizes
the Secretary of the Treasury to appoint a com-
mission to consist of three persons to inquire and
report as to the best mode of raising the revenue
required to supply the wants of the Government;
the commission to have power to take testimony
and to obtain information in such manner as they
may deem expedient or as the Secretary of the
Treasury may prescribe.
The joint resolution also appropriates such an
amount as may be necessary to defray the ex-
penses of the commission.
Mr. MORRILL. I believe there will be no
objection to that resolution from any part of the
House. It is manifest that such a commission
ought to have existed from the very foundation
of the Government, and it is indispensably neces-
sary in these tim.es to enable Congress to legis-
late wisely on tin; subject of taxation.
Mr. COX. I de.sire to ask whethei these com-
missioners are to be appointed from outside the
Treasury Department?
Mr. MORRILL. They are to be appointed
by the Secretary of the Treasuiy from any class
of persons he may select for the purpose of ob-
taining information on the subject of taxation.
Mr. COX. If they are to be appointed from
persons outside the Treasury Department 1 de-
sire to inquiie what salary they ate to receive.
Mr. MORRILL. Nothing more than their
expenses is provided for by this resolution. They
are to take the testimony of merchants and others,
and their report, if they act judiciously, cannot
fail to be very valuable. It is impossible now
for any one to t^ll m every case how much taxa-
tion many articles will bear without the tax be-
coming oppressive. Take, for instance, the large
number of artielesof which alcohol forms a com-
ponent part, or those goods made m part of silk,
and so of many others; the infoimation which
such a commission may obtain from merchants
largely engaged in the purchase and sale of such
articles will be invaluable. I hope there will be
. no objection to the joint resolution.
Mr. FCRRNAN. if I were satisfied that busi-
ness men and not politicians would he appointed
I would not object.
Mr. MORRILL. The gentleman will have to
trust the S'-cretary of the Treasury for that.
Mr. COX. I do not like the idea of allowing
meichants to come and make arrangements to
favor their own commodities. It is the business of
the Treasury Depaitment to collect all necessary
information on thissuhject, and they already have
that power. I am opposed to going outside that
Department to appoint new officers for this pur-
pose.
Mr. MORRILL. I assure the gentleman the
Treasury Department possesses no such power
as this lesohuion provides for.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I must object to that prop-
osition.
DIRECT TAXES IX KEJJEL STATESâ€”AGAIN.
The SPEAKER. Then the question will be on
the passage of the bill reported by the gentleman
from New Vork from the Committee of Ways and
Means.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I demand the yeas and
nays upon the passage of that bill.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. FENTON. As I am informed there may
be no quorum present if the vote is taken at this
time, 1 will, with the consent of the House.ask
that ihe bill may be recommitted to the Commit-
tee of Ways and Means.
There being no objection, the bill was accord-
ingly recommitted.

JOHN J. MIOIUB.
