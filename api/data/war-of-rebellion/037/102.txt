handsomely repulsed by the Forty-sixth, thirtieth, and Twenty-THIRD Alabama Regiments, the last regiment,*under the gallant Colonel [F. K.]Beck, having moved forward under a heavy fire and driven back a battery of the enemy which had been placed within 400 yards of our line. Having checked the enemy on my center and left, and having ordered the regiments last mentioned to hold their respective positions, my attention was called to the very heavy fire on my right. Upon proceeding there, I found that Cumming's brigade had been driven back by the enemy, and the Twentieth and Thirty-first Alabama Regiments, of my brigade, had been compelled to retire, their right flank having become exposed and the enemy having gained their rear. At about the same time the enemy had advanced rapidly on my left, and had almost gained the Edwards Depot road, half a mile to the rear of my line Under these circumstances I ordered the forty-sixth, thirtieth, and Twenty-THIRD Alabama Regiments to retire about 600 yards to the rear, where my SECOND line was formed. These three regiments behaved with distinguished gallantry, retaining their position against heavy odds. I at this time went to the road, about 600 yards in rear of my line and found it filled with stragglers, and hearing that Bowen's DIVISION was re-enforcing on my right, and that Barton's brigade was going on my left, I again returned to my SECOND line, carrying with me about 400 stragglers, most of them from the Thirty-fourth Georgia (Colonel [J. A. W] Johnson), whom I placed on the left on the Thirtieth Alabama Regiment (Colonel Shelley). With these-re-enforcements the enemy were broken in some confusion observing with Colonel Woods, forty-sixth Alabama, made a most gallant charge with his regiment, moving up almost to his original position in the line of battle. Soon afterward Bowen's DIVISION, on my right, and Barton's brigade, on ly left, having retreated, and the enemy having crossed the Edwards Depot road with at least three regiments, I ordered Colonel D. C. Stith, of my staff, to recall the Thirtieth Alabama (Colonel Shelley) and the Forty-sixth Alabama could not be reached, and I regret to say that this excellent regiment, under its gallant field officers (Colonel Woods, lieutenant -Colonel [O.]Kyle, and Major [James M.]Handley, was captured. My brigade was then rallied about half a mile from the Edwards Deport road and in rear of Buford's brigade, Loring's DIVISION, which had just arrived on the field at about 3. 30 p. m. Major-General Loring soon after came up with Featherston's brigade, and recognizing him as the senior officer on the field, and not seeing my DIVISION commander (Major-General Stevenson), I reported to him for orders, and was placed on the left of Featherston's brigade. General Loring soon afterward informed me that he had received orders to retire, and directed me to commence at once the movement toward the ford on Baker's Creek. The retreat was conducted with order, and we arrived at the ford at about 6 p. m., where my brigade was halted. During the retreat, general Loring sent repeated messages to me to hasten my movements, which was done. On crossing Baker's Creek, I found that General Loring and not followed my brigade, but had halted on the opposite side. I at this time received an order from General Pemberton to move to the brigade
