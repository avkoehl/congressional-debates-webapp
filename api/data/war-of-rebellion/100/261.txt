Major L. M. DAYTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Numbers of Hampton's and Wheeler's cavalry deserters are coming into my lines. They wish to retain their horses and be paroled. What can be done in such cases? I believe Wheeler and Hampton would lose half their cavalry if his was done and could be made known to them.
