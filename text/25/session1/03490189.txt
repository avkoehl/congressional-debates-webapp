25th Cong.....1st Sfss.                                 Making public officers depositories—Mr. King.                                                         Senate.
tion. With this view, he adopted -the famous
Specie circular—a sort of order m council—though
the identical measure had been a few days before
proposed as a legislative measure, and, with almost
perfect unanimity, rejected by the Senate.
The principal, perhaps only, object of this mea-
sure was to save from explosion some of the totter-
ing deposite banks in the west and southwest, when
they should be called on to comply with the depo-
site law, and surrender the public money. His
object could not have been to prevent over-issues,
such an object being inconsistent with his opposi-
tion to the deposite bill, which was certainly, of all
others, the best conceived for that purpose What-
ever might have been the motive, the measure was
an unwise and unfortunate one, deranging the
whole internal commerce of the countrj, producing
panic, breaking up exchanges, and destroying cre-
dit, at the very time, of all others, when the coun-
try should have been permitted to make the best of
its resources, without violence or surprise
Mr. K said he was sorry to see his friends who
had voted against this Executive measuie through-
out, now coming forward sanctifying an Executive
triumph over the legislative authority, by acknow-
ledging their error. His worthy triend from Con-
necticut had said, that though he had voted uni-
formly against it, jet that it "might have done
some good in saving the banks " This confession
of his friend was, perhaps, a harmless offering to
Executive power, but as he did not approve of such
gratuitous benevolence at the cost of consistency,
m a matter of so much impt rtance to the country,
he must say to his friend that he entirely disagreed
with him, and mustcali upon him foi some of the
benefieial effects oí this wis>e and salutary measure
The Senator himself told us in the next breath that
the deposite banks, and all other banks, are bro-
ken, and that the pub'ic money, both specie and
paper, have become unavailable m their vaults.
The patient is dead, and yet the treatment is lauded
If a quack, m defiance of all remonstrances, conti-
nues his treatment, and the patient dies, we may
conjecture that he would have done no better with a
different treatment, or without treatment, but how
he could have done worse, it is somewhat difficult to
conceive. This measure, then, condemned by the
Senate, condemned by the Cabinet, condemned by
the people, after full trial, cendemned by the whole
legislative authority, and condemned by the strong
evidences of the mischief it has produced, is still
persevered in by the Executive, lauded for its ' sa-
lutary effects," and was referred to by one Senator
(looking at Mr. Benton) as " the glorious specie
circular. [Mr. Benton " Yes, the ever-glorious
specie wrcu lar."] Mr. K. (with great animation)
Ah, j es, it i  all glory, and no good. Where are
the evidences oí your glory? Is there any thing
glonous in the present unhappy condition of the
country"? Your Government insolvent and disgra-
ced Our people branded by foreigners as a nation of
fraudulent bankrupts and swindlers, y our merchants
bankrupt, your manufacturers langui-hmg m idle-
ness and distress, your planters rumed, and two-
thirds of the laboring population of the United
States threatened Kith actual starvation These are
the evidences of the "salutary" effects of the mea-
sures we are called on to glorify Why, sir, the
Senatoi must have forgotten that glory has depre-
ciated in the market Like paper currency, it has
been redundant, and is now almost as much below
par, as rag money, very much for the same rea-
son, too. One examination, we find that neither
has had a very solid basis to rest upon
So much (said Mr King) for the glory of this
older I now propose to take a more dispassion-
ate, and better reasoned view of it as a financial
measure.
Theplam objection to the cncular as a financial
measure is, that it did violence to all the laws of
trade and commerce by the forcible mteiference of
the Government The easing operations of ex-
changes, so useful and necessary in adjusting ascer-
tained balances between different sections of the
country, were suddenly and violently interrupted
The useful admonition of an unfavorable balance,
as indicated by the exchanges, was not only disre-
garded, but that balance forcibly increased The de-
structwe tendency of such interference by Govern-
ment in the commerce of the country has been
acknowledged by the Senator from North Carolina
(Mr Strange) though I thought the principle might
have been better applied by him Such measures
produce the same effects m the same way, when-
ever and wherever applied in a free commeicial
country, always taking the people by surprise, and
breaking up the estabh-hed order of thing. The
business of the country is as effectually deranged
and disorganized by such violence as is the human
sysrem by the destruction of the heart.
Commerce has it laws The People study them,
and by study, observation, and experience, become
acquainted with them, to a very great extent, and
make their calculations and regulate their business
accordingly. They always must greatly suffer
when forcibly deprived of these advantages , and
particulaily if the force be applied to a paper or
mixed cuirency. Doubtless the evils of a paper
currency (though it has some advantages,) are very
great. I do not know, in many respects, that they
are over-estimated by the Senator fiom Missouri.
I hope he, how ever after the most fatal experience
to the countrv, will come to the conclusion that
the evils of the system can only be reached by a"
legislative authority that can reach the system itself
It is acknowledged we have no power over the
system, and yet, by this Executive lashing and fret-
ting, and chastising, and torturing, we keep the
country and the currency m a perpetual fever and
fluctuation, gn ing us all the evils of the system,
without its advantages Sn, you might as well
undertake to make a full-grown intellectual man,
with trow el and mortar, and regulate the circula-
tion of his blood with a tinker's tools, as to under-
take to make a uniform standard of value of a
pap;r or mixed currency, and regulate its func-
tions, as monev, by the continual Unletmg, and the
successive and sudden application of force by the
iron hand of Government. Sti, you can't do it,
you have neither the materials nor the laws for
such a consummation You may do infinite mis-
chief, but you will never do any good. You may
break up business, and rum the industrious classes,
but jou will do no good to any class, except such
as know how to piofit by confusion, and speculate
on the misfortunes of their fellow -men
He said, that at the very time this strange order
was issued, exchange was airead) sufficiently high
against the sothwest, and west, to have made the
transmission of specie a profitable operation This
\ as seen by the Senate when they with such una-
nimity refused to take the responsibility of the mea-
sure The effect, as foreseen, w as first to raise
the exchanges, and then break them up Why,
sn, said he, if the whole currency of the country
had been specie, any measure opposing the foice
of Government to the laws of trade, the practical
effect of which should be to require the actual
tiansmission of specie against the rate of exchange,
would so far double the exchanges upon a mathe-
matical principle, by requiring two ti anstts of specie
instead of one So true is t^e opeiation of this
principle, that even an arbitrary requisition that
the paper money alone of the Atlantic seaboard
should be received for public lands, would have
produced a heaiy effect upon the exceanges,
because in the exchanges it would have aided to the
wrong side of the account
But, sir, whrn we come tc the actual opeiation
m question , when we come not onlj to take money
from a point where it is due, and send it to a point
from which it is ow mg—to take it from the creditor
and send it to the debtor, but perform this rough
and anti-commercial operation by taking away the
tery basis upon which five-sixths of the cun ency rests,
\ou produce effects that can never be arithmetically
calculated, and of which no adequate conception
can be foimed, except by witnessing the actual
effects almost immediately produced by the mea-
sure on the commercial seatoaul, and those sec
tions upon which the measure wis ínlende I to
operate An exact íaüo would contract the w hole
currency m the money market, fiom -which the
specie is thus diawn, m the proportion m which
paper is based on specie, thereb) contracting six
millions tor eveiy one thus abstracted, if the pio-
poition lie five papei dolíais based on one of
specie    But we all know that such measuics do
not operate in an exact, but in a loose ratio, from
the apprehension, the confusion, panic, and alarm
which they create, and the commercial resources
they cut off This measure cut off, to a great ex-
tent, the resources of the Atlantic merchants in the
enormous amount of debt due them from the West
and Southwest, for it not only unnaturally sent
their money from them, but prevented any coming
to them But determining to have some friends to
the measure, it has been insisted that although it
may have ruined the Atlantic merchants, and done
injury to creditors, yet it was a great blessing to
the people of the West These people, however,
it seems, are not so easily gulled by these forced
blessings, fur, after a full trial of it, their represen
tatives, with great unanimity, voted last session to
repeal it. The able speech of one of their repre-
sentatives, (Mr Walker,] at the la^t session,
explained to us the nature and operation of this
blessing, and the Legislature of his State had,
by a resc lution, unanimously sustained him He
did not know how grateful his friend felt for these
blessings forced upon him by the Executive, and
which had contributed so largly to bankrupt his
constituents, but for himself, Mr K said (to use
a rustic phrase) he would not like to be funnelled
even with cnampagne
But what was its " happy effect" upon the West
and Southwest, whilst it ruined the seaboard' Was
the debtor aided whilst the creditor was oppressed?
Not at all, sir Whilst this specie was on the voj-
age af its exile, and after it reached the deposite
banks, so far as the commercial and planting inte-
rests were concerned, it might as well have been
buried in the middle of the earth, or carried back to
the mines of Mexico Did it aid the merchant m
paying his northern and eastern deots' No it im-
mediately increased the cost to him of such payment, by
increasing the rate of exchange, whilst, at the •"tme
time, it closed upon htm all the usual resources of ob-
taining money. This increase in the rate of exchange
increased the danger of a demand upon Ihe banks
by the merchants, whilst they had also to answer
the demands of their bill-holders, who might want
to purchase the public lands What northern ex-
change they had was soon exhausted in reducing
their circulation, whilst they could not prudently
do any business that would place their own issues
m the hands of the business part of the coramuw-
tj Jlgainst the business part of the community, hot
met chants and planters, they were suddenly and effec-
tually closed They could not pav out paper
for fear specie would be demanded for it,
for the reasons before named They could
not pay out specie or discount for merchants,
because the high rate of exchange and difficulty
of procuring it at any price would have started it
back in twenty-four hours to the section from
which it had been unnaturally exiled They could
not pay out specie to the planters, for they owed
the merchants, and its destination would have been
the same. If, then, they did any business at al!,
they must do it with the purchasers of public lands, in
which they were secure of the return of the specie depo-
sites Accordmglj, they favored this class of cus-
tomers, m order to do any business at all, and the
President himself, in his Message refers to the
circular opeiation by which they contracted many
millions of debt upon a few millions of specie, and
yet one popular catch to recommend this measure
has been, that it was aimed at land speculator1
The measure, Mr K said, seemed to have been
attended with unmitigated mischief Even the
sa'es of public lands had most probably been in-
creased by it, befoie the suspension of specie pay-
ments There was no other way of acecu i'ing
for the heaiy amount of those sales, after the
mama for specu'ation had already begun to d'-
clme Monej became dear and difficult to pro-
cure, and all the public lands in market very much
cul ed and seltctcd The deposite banks in the
new States hdd been devoted almost otlu'-nelv to
the u-.e of speculators, as before «¡'aled, and,
moreover, a great number were induced to
go into the business aftei the adiption of the
order, who otherwise would not 1 i\f thought
