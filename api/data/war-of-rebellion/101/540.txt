Major General J. J. REYNOLDS,

Commanding Department of Arkansas:

I inclose for your information a copy of a communication I have to-day sent to the headquarters Military Division of West Mississippi. * I shall rely on you to push as large a force, with great ostentation as you can, from Pine Bluff toward Camden as far as the Saline. I would like to have the enemy convinced, if possible, that you have a bona fide intention of attacking Camden so as to draw force from Monticello. I hope you will demonstrate strongly for five days after the 25th, and then return home as fast as you please. By that time I hope to have my force out of the way and after Harrison. I would be glad to get your views.
