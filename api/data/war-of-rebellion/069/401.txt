HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864-11.20 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

Your dispatches of 10.20 and 11 a. m. just received. I had already ordered Rickett's and Russell to advance with Hancock's right, and to push their skirmishers at once forward. Neill's, massed on the right, is held in readiness to move to Hancock's support, as will be also the divisions of Ricketts and Rusell in case the nature of the ground, which is represented as nearly impracticable in their front, prevents their advance. The withdrawal of Neill will uncover our right.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864.

Major-General WRIGHT:

I have occupied the enemy's first line of yesterday, and am ordered to press forward closely to ascertain their new position, and am informed that General Wright and Burnside will be directed to advance at the same time.

Your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864-12 m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

There seems to be no doubt that the enemy overlap my right, such being the report of my own and some of the staff officers of General Russell. Russell has been for two hours engaged in a critical examination of his front, but has not reported yet. Part of Ricketts' division has occupied the enemy's first line with the Second Corps. I am just going to the front, leaving Colonel McMahon here.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864-1.15 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

My Third Division has crossed the marsh and taken position in enemy's first line on right of Second Corps, doing this by turning the marsh in front of Second Corps batteries. I have instructed Russell to connect on right tiff he can possibly cross the swamp in his vicinity. Report from officer of the day, Third Division, is that enemy has moved toward our right. This may be to prevent being outflanked, or possibly to turn our right. I will look out for it, and shall not move Neill without pressing necessity, as he is all we have on the right of the army.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
