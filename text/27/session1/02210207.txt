they would be most Iike'y tokeepawatchfut eye on the exren

anrientanl salutary tule had been departed irom
Ml McK then went into a cdculáiion to show that llieie
was no need of appropriating the sums in the bill, which, ad
áed tj the arrearsof appiopiat'oi s would form an agrégate
far gieatai than cuull be needed Heiephtdto the lemarks
which had been made as to the r^lucti in of appropriations by
fie late AtlmiBiatidtiori ard retelling to a íepoit «I the  e
cietaiy ul War, insis'ed ilia* it contained a clear, di eel, palpa
ble,and severe imputation on the two lío i es of Congress loi
their conduct in defeirmg then appropnation bills to so latea
period in then sessions U Cougiess r ceded reform m this re
spect, gentlemen had the nujoi y, let them reform it But if
the late pellod of the appropriation bills were a good reason
lor asking now a larger amount foi public woiks it would be so
after each long session in future, md so an extra session of
Congress would be needed every two years' Mr McK agieed
with Mr D wi son in the opinion that theie was agieat want of
system m appropriating for fortifications, and said it was the
duty oí Congress not only to make appropriations, b it to pro
vide the means to make them the Board of Engineers had laid
down an admirable system, the error lay in departing iiom it,
as nas done in this bill Mi McK thought much evil aio e
tiori the attempt to cany on so miny woiks at the same time
some of than must be placed undei officers of lufenor quahfii a

Mr SIcK refeired to the Piesidem's niessagefta° holdir^om
the piospect that the peace ofthe country would be pre=etved
he should vot<> on that assumption, unless the Piesldeitslnuld
make a oojtiary announcement to the country There had
been a wai p nfego ten up eveiy two or ihiee yeais, an J tl en
laige sums were voted for military vol Its andnooied i limed
me-ie against such panics than had the piesent "sccre uy of
Wai w lien a member of that House (fibre Mi McK quoted
a speech of Mr Bell) Here Mr Secietiry spoke of'a race
between al rcpnations and dlsbuisement0 " but what was the
case now? Had not estimates been thiown into the House for
laigesums purposely to swell the deficit for which a loan ws
tobe taken? The object was plain and palpable, and \vl y
would gentlemen go into appropriations at this moment, which
ought to bedeferied till theregulai session?
Mr MASON, alluding to a remark oi Mi    McK \ that it   ¡
was the duty of Confess not only to make appropiiatiors, but
to provide the means to meet them, said thdt that was pi ease

Mr M warmly defended the Secietaiy of War from tne
charge of having rastlmputations upon Congiess macommu

triotism which sought to involve out own Government still
more md a!ing wi h great questions of foreign aggression, and
to render a settlement of those quest onssull more difficult He
remembered a ceuam wat report which closed the cueei of
the late Admmistiauon, and by what vote and by whose vote it
had been adopted-a report which caused the Mediteiranean

McLeod That suhiect was in agitation elsewhere, and he

assumed by the Secretary of Mate m his late correspondence
with ihe lliitish Rliiustn, that should McLeod be surrendered*
the difficulty was not obviated It was dear that redress, and
