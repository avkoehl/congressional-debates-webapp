HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Atlanta, Ga., September 30, 1864.

Major General G. H. THOMAS,

Chattanooga, Tenn.:

GENERAL: I have yours and Rousseau's dispatches. * Try and make a junction with Rousseau. I suppose Forrest will manage to break the road to-night, but leave defensive garrisons, and push right at him with as heavy a force as you can get and as soon as possible. He won't fight, but infantry can dog him. Take provisions and forage of the towns and people, and replace them after the work is done. If you can turn him toward Lamb's Ferry, Granger should make a redoubt covering the ford, and hold him in check till the infantry can get up. We will never have a better chance at him than now. I will watch Hood here.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Brigadier-General ELLIOTT,

Chief of Cavalry:

GENERAL: Telegram of Kilpatrick's received. + The general-in- chief directs me to say he is not particular about the state of affairs on this side of Chattahoochee, but desires you to re- enforce the brigade on the other side as much as you can, and from any quarter, as he wants affairs there well looked to.

I am, general, yours, &amp;c.,

Keep yourself well posted with reference to the movements of Forrest and Wheeler, and be prepared to attack either should they come near you. I shall send a DIVISION up to Tullahoma to-day to clear the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad and then follow the enemy.
