PORT HUDSON, March 27, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Enemy has gone back to Baton Rouge, including also troops from west bank of river; has sent back all his mortar-boats and sloops of war. Two gunboats and Essex are all that remain. Rust's wagons ought to be sent; they are much needed.

Brigadier General W. R. SCURRY,

Commanding, &c.:

The major-general commanding directs that you stretch a line of troops across the Indian frontier from Montague County to Fort Clark, using the Frontier Regiment for the southern portion of the line and either Gould's or Stone's regiment for the northern portion of the line.
