270                                     THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.______             February 20,
from its exercise since 1667, while in this country
the President, regardless ot public sentiment, has
exercised it till it has become an occurrence of
almost evei y day The President is only a ser-
vant of the people, like us Has no inviolability
of person, no prerogatives, or privileges, distinct
from any other citizen, but is liable to impeach-
ment like any other officer Here is a marked
distinction between the two Executives of Eng-
land and the United States. One advantage only
the veto power possesses, and which the pro-
posed amendment does not disturb It antici-
pates a reexamination of a measure whicff*has
been vetoed for the purpose of arresting any-
thing which may be prejudicial to the public
good But when the legislative power shall pass
a bill a third time after it has been rejected by
the Executive, Mi K said he could not con-
sent that the will of one man shall frustrate the
repeatedly expressed'will of thepeople. He heard
an experienced member of the other House say
that he believed the President had more power
than the King of Englai J, and he believed tliere
was much more to be feaied fiom encroachments
by the executive upon the legislative, than by the
legislative upon the executive power The shoit
periods for which the members of the Legislature
ate elected, literally prevents any eombtrations
against the Executive But the real chaiactei of
the Executive is unknown to the people, and his
will remains ¡n his single breast Here is the
weak point of 1 ""publican Governments Who, in
the history of the woild, have attempted to usurp
power' Has it ever been the legislative power5
All histoiy shows that it has always been the
chief executive who has acted against the liber-
ties of the i eople Was it Ca;sar or the Senate
whouttempted the liberties of Rome 5 It isurde-
ntable that there is a constant tendency in the ex-
ecutive power to contemn the law,and undeimine
the piovisions of law Tins pnnciple is to be
found in the writings of all the patiiots who wrote
prior to the adoption of the present Constitution
But how has the veto powei been exeicised here-
tofore5 In the commencement of the Govern-
.rnent, it was used to conect the eilects of hasty
and precipitate legislation, and of those acts which
are supposed to violate the Constitution As time
piogresses, we find it no longer confined to such
cases, but it assumes thepowei to act upon finance,
commerce,and in fact everything which affects the
interest of the people Twice or ly was it exeited
during the fust twenty years of the Government
Seven times within the fust live yeais of this
.Admimstiation, eiiioiaung vanous mteiests and
deeply inteie«tmg to the people We find the
executive will opf osed to the legislative will, anti-
cipating and controlling the acuon of Con/rcs,
and entering upon the initiating poweis of Con-
giess, proposing a law which they may register
and heappióve When these examples are before
us, what may not be appiehended in succeeding
ages5 The dangei consists, not in the possession
of powei, but in the illegal and impropei exeruse
of it.
Mr CLAY said that the gentleman from Maiy-
land had piesented a most interesting pioposition,
and he owed him his thanks for it, a3 well as foi
the deal mannei in which he had elucidated and
sustained it The su'ject (he said) was undoubt-
edly entitled to mature consideration, he was
inclined to support H, not only from a convction
of the necessity of entailing the enormity of ex-
ecutive power, but because fiom the practical exer-
cise of its effects, it had long since been felt m his
State But he legietted that it was so late in the
sesbion that it could not receive a delibeiate con
eideration lie thought a period might arttve
when we could do so But at present he would
move to lav the subject on the table, promising to
rail it up if an occasion should offer, duung tne
iesidue of the session
The motion was agreed to
BRANCHES OP   THE UMTED STATEb MINT.
On motion of Mr WAGG4MAN, the Senate
proceeded to consider, as in Comm ttee of the
Whole, the bill to establish branches of the United
States mint
Mi WAGGAMAN, in explanation of the ob*
joctsof the bill, said that when the mint was first
established, branches of the institution were con-
templated The importations of gold and silver
bullion into New Orleans is now three times as
great as it is in any other port of the United States,
and it is daily accumulating In the Globe of to-
day, there is a statement that, on the 26 h Janu-
uary last, there was, in two vessels, an importation
of upwards of half a million into the port of New
Oileans, fiom which it is obviously necessary to
establish a brancn of the mint there, to do away
the expense and risk of transportation of the bul-
lion to the mint at Philadelphia, which amounted
to no less than two and a half per cent But a
moie impressive argument (he said) was, that it
would have the effect of adding to the circulating
medium of the country some two and a half or
three millions of dollars The effects of this
would be felt throughout the whole West We
in the southwest laboi undei very great diffi-
culties for want of a specie currency The gieat
sales of the public lands have caused a corstant
flow of specie to the Atlantic States—and we have
now, m every State of the Union, batches of banks
which are deluging the country with a cuirency
I which is utterly useless to us, and which, by its
I continuance, will be productive of themost imnous
effects in the rise of property which it will pio-
duce As regards the blanches in the southern
country, the necessity of them must be obvious to
every gentleman In a very few years the mines
in that region will yield at least two millions, and
the risk oi transpoiting such an immense amount
of bullion to Philadelphia will present almost an
insurmountable barrier to sending it theie foi
coinage Mi.W declined saying tiny thing moie
until  he heard some objections to the bill, which
I he would undertake to answer, if there should be
any offered
Mr TALLMADGE then offered an amend-
ment to the first section, providing foi the estab-
lishment of a branch at New Yoik
Mr T said, thatif the system of branches was
to be adopted, the large amount of specie im-
poned into New Yoik, which was the great radi-
ating point for the internal commerce of the coun-
try, made it proper that there should be a branch
there
Mr. WAGGAMAN could not accept the amend
ment, because he did not think a blanch of the
mint necessary at New York     It was within six
hours of facile transpoitation to Philadelphia, and
ceitainly it was not immediately necessary
Mr CALHOUN hoped the gentleman from
New York would not pi ess his amendment    At
I piesent,a branch at New York wis not necessaiy
Heieafter, he proposed to extei d the system by
establishing branches at New York, Boston, Balti-
moie, and Charleston, the gieat importing points
of the count] y But at present he hoped the gen-
tleman would not cncnmbei this bill
Mr BENTON lose to say a single word He
bdonged to the committee which repoited this
bill He had looked over it with ananxions eye,
and found that it enteied into his views of lestor-
ing a metallic cuuency to the country He was
in favor'of establishing branches of the mint
wherevei they were necessary, and he was also
leady to appropnate money out of the Tieasury
to give a hard money curiency to the people of
the United States In Fiance, which embraces a
territory greatly less than that of the United States,
theie are ten branches of the mint, and in Mexico
theie exist seven In the United States, from the
peruhar configuration of the country, it might not
j be necessai y to have more than six or seven, but
it is of importance to the West that there should
. be one at New Oileans     On the Atlantic, there
' may be necessity foi more He was therefore
íeady to vote as much money as was necessary
] for this purpose Ata future day, he would be
willing to vote for a branch at New Yoik, but at
[ piesent the intendment proposed was only loading
| down the bill In No 44 of the Federalist, Mr
Madison enters into an exposition of the coming
I powei, and states, that as many local mints as may
be necessary to the wants of the eountrv may be
established Before the confederation, each State
had the oower of coining at its own mint, but the
! power has been sunendered, and as there is not
the facility in the Atlantic States to diffuse coin
through the West, it becomes themore necessary,
a single mint in Philadelphia partakes, in a gieat
i measuie, of the chaiacter of a local institution
I When Mr Hillhouse was a member of the Senate,
' many years ago, he actually mtioduced a resolu-
tion  foi the puipose of abolishing the mint  at
' Philadelphia, viewing it as a local institution
But happily the resolution did not pass. Mr B
said he apprehended it was a right of the people
oí the South and West to have branches of the
I mint, and he deemed it necessiry in order to pre-
vent the notes of the local banks fiom becoming
the cuuency of the Federal Government.    In 1789
I Congiess passed a revenue law, in which they
expressly required  that the  revenue  should be
' received and paid out in gold and silver only, and
he hoped to see the time when the Government
j would be restored to as good a condition as it was
at that time He would certainly vote for branches
wheiever they were necessary.
I     Mr TALLM ADGE remarked that, as honor-
I able gentlemen had intimated their intention to
carry out the system of branches at another time,
I he would withdraw the amendment.
I The Senate then pioceeded, on motion of Mr
WAGGAMAN, to fill up the blanks left in the
bill, as follows.
For the annual salary of the superintendent of
the mint at New Oileans...............$3 000
t     To thetie^surer......................2,000
|     To the chief coiner     ................2,000
j     To the assayer and refiner, each   ......2,000
|     To two clerks, each................1,700
To enty subordinate workmen were also author-
ized to be employed at that branch
Other blanks were fided as follows
For the branches in North Carolina and Georgia,
the superintendents, each...............$2 000
The chief coiners, each  ,............. 1,500
rhea¡>sayers,melteis,and refiners, each, 1,500
Two clerks, each....................1,000
Five subordinate workmen and servants to be
allowed at each branch
1 Mr KING, of Alabama, offered an amendment
requiring the appointment of the officers to be
made as soon as the necessary building shall be
eiected
I Mr CLAY said this bill was a measure of con-
siderable importance, and he had not information
sufficient on the subject to enable him to form
an opinion upon the pi opnety of its passage He
did not know whether the mint was or was not
sufficient to do the coinage of the country But
he thought, while we were discussing the danger
and ext#nt of executive patronage, we ought to
be cautious how we passed laws to increase it.
But he wanted to examine the subject—he knew
nothing at all about it—it was new, and he had
not reflected upon it, nor did he know anything
about the expense which would attend it He
therefore moved to lay the bill on the table, and
have it and the amendments printed Mr C, how-
ever, withdrew the motion at the request of some
gentlemen
I Mr CALHOUN thought the bill would be
extending the expense, but he put it to the gen-
tleman fiom Kentucky, whether all our citizens
ou^ht not to be placed on a footing—they were
now  mcuirmg  a  loss of  more than the whole
I expense of these branches Aie not the people
of the South  entitled  to have the  benefits  and
' advantages of this Government equally with other
, citizens5
Mi PORTER opposed the motion—the effect
of laying the bill on the table would be, that it
would not be acted on m the House this session,
and the object would therefore be defeated—it was
of importance to the whole Union, and paiticu-
larly the western country
i Mr CLAY said, if we must go on and discuss
the bill, let us go at it      The annual expense of
I these establishments must be near half a million of
dollars, and the same in perpetuity, for it was
folly to suppose, if orce established, that they
would ever be discontinued     He wanted to look
l into this question, and see what the probable
importations of specie may reasonabl) be expected
to be     The late importations are known  to be
j very  extiaordmary, and   to have  ansen  from
i uncommon causes But he begged he might not
be driven into this question—he was not informed
i on the subject, and could not consent to let it go
on He therefoie renewed the motion to lay the
bill on the table
