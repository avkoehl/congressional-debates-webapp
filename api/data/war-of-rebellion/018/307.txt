Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Dispatch received. I reported to the President at 6.10 p.m. situation of affairs in our vicinity. My command is in position to meet any attack from the enemy. I have never entertained an idea of withdrawing my forces from Fredericksburg, and I trust that as no discredit has ever yet fallen on the division none will be apprehended now.
