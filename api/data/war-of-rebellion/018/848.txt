HEADQUARTERS VALLEY DISTRICT,April 13, 1862.

Major General R. S. EWELL,

Commanding Potomac District:

MY DEAR GENERAL: All is quest in front. I am much obliged to your for the news. If I fall back, we should effect a junction on the road leading from Madison Court-House to New Market. This will prevent our missing each other. My impression is that General Johnston was of the opinion that this road crossed the Blue Ridge at Swift Run Gap, but such is not the case; its name is Fisher's Gap, and we should meet the enemy this side of Fisher's Gap a short distance. Swift Run Gap is where the road from Harrisonburg to Gordonsville crosses the Blue Ridge. Until yesterday I was under the impression that Swift Run Gap was at fisher's Gap. We will have a strong position this side of Fisher's Gap and at the Gap. But I do not much expect that Banks will follow me to them.

Very truly, yours,

T. J. JACKSON.

NEAR MOUNT JACKSON, April 14, 1862-5 a. m.

Major General R. S. EWELL,

Commanding Potomac District:

MY DEAR GENERAL: your dispatch of yesterday, with accompanying papers, has been received. I am much obliged for the news. Unless you have instructions upon the subject requiring you to fall back I am of the opinion that you had better not do so, and especially not toward madison Court-House, as the enemy may hear of it and suspect that you are re-enforcing me. On the 8th instant General Johnston wrote to me" "Should you" (fall back much farther, he" (meaning you)" should come to the Rapidan." The general does not state why he desires you to go to the Rapidan, but it may be for the purpose of deceiving the enemy with regard to ultimate destination, to be more distant from the enemy during the movement, and also to be in a more forcible position for re-enforcing some other points, should it be necessary. My own opinion is that Banks will not follow me up the Blue Ridge; but should he do so, you will have time enough to join me before he reaches the top of the mountain, as he will be retarded in his march. I wish he would pursue, and let us with our united forces meet him at the mountain. It would not be safe for me to join you on the Sperryville road, as an advance of Banks would place him in my rear. My desire is, as far as practicable, to hold the valley, and if I fall back from New Market toward Madison Court-House I hope that Banks will be deterred from advancing much farther toward Staunton by the apprehension of my returning to New Market and thus getting in his rear. I will try and have the absentees from the Tenth Virginia Regiment attended to, but apprehend that it will only be partially successful, as it is difficult to get hold of those who try to keep concealed.

Very truly, yours,

T. J. JACKSON.
