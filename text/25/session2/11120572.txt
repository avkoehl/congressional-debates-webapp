these influences have existed, do now exist, and will alwajs
exist, none acquainted With the human character, oi who nas
read with piofit the histoiy of man, none will be disponed to
deny It this source of patronage can be cut off and the public
press disentangled from any Government alliance, controlling
its freedom, or poisoning its purity, a gieat achievement foi
virtue, morality, libeity, anil free institutions, will have been
accomplished It is an experiment well worth making, and to
the accomplishment of which I will readily aid
My honorable colleague «ays that he wi'l not, unless for very
strong and urgent reasons, prosenbe any class of our citizens
This is right, Mr Speaker, lam pleabtd to hear it avowed by
my colleague I hope that it will not only be avowed, but that
all will practice it, that to example will be added precept, and
that my colleague, extending the principle to all ite legitimate
lengths, will rebuke not only the press, but -ill who undertake
to proscribe individuals for their opinions If this piecept had
been followed by example, I, humble I, would have escaped
some severe blows—some hard rubs ior my obstinacy in acting
and speaking accoidmg to the honest dictates of my conscience
My colleague says, if u be right to make the separation, let it
be done by the votes of the Houi-e I cannot, Ml Speaker see
the propriety of the dibti action which mv colleague takes If
the principle be sound, I cannot perceive the difference mas
sernng by law or by vote, in either case the effect will be pre
cisely the same liut I am far from acknowledging that the re
solution, if cart led out, will have this effect It prosenbe? none,
itieaves the editors of political journals to pursue the r labors
in their owm way, it pio&cnbes no prmtei oi no pie&°, it only
aeeks-to prevent an alliance of a corrupting and dangerous cha
raeter—an alliance between the Government and political lour
nals, which would be dangerous to both
My honoiable colleague, in the comae of his remark**, re'ei

my late colleague, [Mr. Patton,] its ehanman, pioposmg to
subscribe foi ten copies of Nile^s National Register dming
eaeh session of Congress, foi the u^e of the rnembeis of this
Heu'fi, m a way which was well calculated, although I am sure
not designed, to do injustice to that f entlemen 1 voted against
laying that resolution on the table, and should have v ottd for its
adoption. The editor of ihat woik had asreed, if the resolution
was adopted, to publish all the laws passed at each session of
Congress, a complete journal of its proceedings, all the public
documents of geneial utility, and the ayes and noes on evtiy
question on which they weie taken These numbers were de
signed to be placed in the hands of the members to be deposited
at some convenient points m each countv of their districis foi
the inspection and use of the people Sir, I shall vote for any
proposition which will carr) the membrt s of this body home to
the people, naked and unmasked, and present in full riinl com
plete view all then actions, m order that they may be held to i
strict accountability The people oueht to h tve, and then mo

to them, constant and accurate information of tne course and
proceedings of then i epresentatives The chaiacterof^Niips's

at a censorship ofthe press Not so, Mr the only supervision
which the Clerk is required to exercise, is as to the mere necu

take oecision, Ah  fj faker  with the imut geme of the House,
to coirect a misstatement m relatim to my course upon this
[    subject   ItWi^Ui a letter written from this place to the Mis
sissippi "Columbus Demociat," among a great many other
things of somewhat a humorous character, that I came here in
July last to trj and get son,e of my poor kin quaitered apon
the Government, but failing, I became dissatisfied, met with
Thomas Allen, who was on a like errand, and had met
with alike disappointment, and entered into an arrangement
with him to set up the Madwoman io upposition to the Admx
rustiation Now, Mr Speaker, this is literally untrue I was
hot here in July, oi at any time between the 4th of March and
the opening of the extra session I made no such application,
and had about as much to do with the establishment ofthe
"Madisoman" as you had Ishould not have noticed this part
of that letter had I not understood from a friend that this state-
ment had been credited, and dtd me injury
My honorable colleague has referred to the opinions of Virgi
nía He tays, and, to prevent mistake, I will give the remark
in the words as published in the Globe " He believed it to be
accoidmg to the settled purpose and desisrn ofthe institutions of
Virginia that the business and opeiations of each Government,
State and Federal, should be kept &epaiate and distinct, and that
that £t eat State rights principie was violated by their connec
tion " Now, Mr Speaker, I cannot accord with my honorable
colleague in the extent ofthe principle winch he here asserts
It would place this Govt rnment beyond all responsibility, and
separate it fiom the intere ts oí the fetates and the people Sir,
our Federal and State Governments are the Governments of the
same people The feta'e Governments and the people are re-
piesented in the legislative body The electoral co'leee for Pie
sidentand Vice Ptesident votes by States, m all this there is
identity and connection of interest But, sir, how the business
and operations of this Government can be separate and distinct
fiomthose ofthe fetates I am at a loss to perceive, when both
onerate upon and affect the same people It cannot be, for it
would be utteily destructive of every principle upon which our
system is founded, and would destroy that harmony and co-ope-
ration in the conduct ofboth so necessary to the success of both.
This Government, in the exercise of arij of its powers, cannot
be obstructed by the State , yet all its acts are upon its respon-
sibihty to the States and the people, and affect their busmen
and interest The States, in the exercise of their reserved rights,
aie independent of and beyond the conti ol of this Government,
and owe it no responsibility, but this Government, constrncted
by tho States, holding its very existence at their wjll, cannot he
sep irate and distinct from them m its operations or business I
cannot yield absent to any doctune whicn shall make this Go-
vernment so independentof the States or the people as tobe be-
yond the reach of that sureand decided íesponsibiluy which 18
so necessary to check its abuses and resist usurpations Such,
I think, is the tendency ofthe principle asserted by my col-
league In the iorm of expression which he has used
My honorable colleague, m replying to a remark of another
colleieue, [Mi Wise,! took occasion to say that he was one of
what wis called ihe Divorce party, that is, that he was friendly
to the " Independent Tieasmy bdl^' that he shou'd take occa-
sion to present his rcisons foi thai, opinion when the question
came up and that he did not doubt he snould be able to satisfy
his tonstnuer ts I differ ladically and es«emiail> with my col*
league upon that question and, like him, I shall take occasion,
when if comes up for con=ideiation, to express my views, m
doing so, I wil'say to many of m> fi ¡ends, in peifectgood hu
mm and wi h eelmes of entire kirdnesi, that I shall piesent
them a mirror in which thty my cee the lefivcnonof ihem-
<elver> TMhe) v ere and, if they w I look at themselves as they
ireie they will find (bat, as ihfvime in every doctrine and
sentiment which I have utteiedupon this question, they weie
like what I am now Ido not domV that I shall satisfy my
constituents that in defending th< position m which General
Tickeon's administration phced me, a position from which I
shall not raieat, I am de'endina tiuih i id the beet interests of
the people
Ihe ^peakeh mtet posed, and said it was not in older, on this
amendment todi^ctss the divorce ques'ion
lam only íeplymg to remarks maue by my colleague, with-
out the in ei position of ÚV CÍtí r
The SpEAivPn ai 1 it w is dtfiicuH to arrest such remarks, as
the Chair couldnotwe 1 peueive the connection ^ which they
might be placed
I desi«t, «*n, and conclude by mymg that I shall vote for the
amendment of my colleague not becaute it is proreily con
nected with the ongniil resolution, or die i eces«it> of much of
it but because the inquiry involves matters which may bear
