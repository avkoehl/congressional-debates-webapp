£&th Cong-—3nd Sess.                                   Pre-emption Bill—Mr. Clay of Ala.______________________________________Senate.
the current demands fer the support of Govern-
ment    It became indispensably necessary for the
President to convene Congress on the first Menday
in September, within six months from the day of
his inauguraron    We were compelled to antici-
pate the receipts of the revenue, and to raise mo-
ney by loans to keep the Government m motion.
At each succeeding session down to the present, we
have been constrained to adopt similar measures,
and, at this moment, there is a bill before the other
branch of Congress again to anticipate the receipts
from the revenue by the lisue of Treasury notes to
the amount of five millions of dollars.   Indeed, we
have been charged on this floor by some of the
Senator's political friend- , since the commencement
of the present session, (how truly, it is not my pre-
sent purpose to inquire,) with having crea'ed a na-
tional debt to the amount of near thirty millions of
dollars; and we have been urged to increase the ta-
riff on certain articles to supply the ordinary warns
of the Government, and supersede the necessity of
an extra session of Congress.   Yet, *ir, under all
these circumstances, and witn this gloomy picture
of our financial condition, presented by ths Oppo-
sition,  a   distinguished   member  of  that   party
comes   forward    with    a   proposition    to   ab-
stract from the Treasury the tntire i even ue from
the public land , not only for the present year, but
for an indefinite period—forever.    I have ¿aid this
would amount to the probable sum of $5,000 000
annually   My estimate is predicated on the receipts
into the Treasury, from the same source, accord-
ing to a table now before me, for a period of ten
years—from 1828 to 1837, both inclusive—dur
ing which an average sum of more than seven
millions of dollars was annually received from this
source of revenue.     And taking into view the
quantity of fresh lands that will be coming into
market m the new States and Territories, it is not
probable the average will be reduced below the
sum I have supposed, within the next ten years
"Well, sir, what must be the inevitable consequence
of withdrawing this large annual sum from the or-
dinary means of meeting the public expenditures?
Will   it not become   absolutely  nece«sary   to
supply the deficiency,  thus   created, by taxation
to that amount, or by borrowing monev?   If we
take five millions of dollars out of the Treasury,
and are compelled to pay it back again, in the form
of new taxes, or an increased tariff, what do we
gam?  Or, rather, is it not obvious that, so far from
gaming any thing, the expenses of collection and
disbursement are a dead loss.1   On the oiher hand,
if we make up the deficiency by borrowing five
millions annually, are we not creating a perma
nent national debt which, with tbe accumulating
ínteres , will, in a fewyeats, amount to an hundred
Bullions of do'lars?
It seems to me, Mr President, that ihere < an be
no diversity of opinion upon tins subject The
proposition of the Senator from Kentucky plainly
involves the alternative, to be submitted to the
American people, whether they will take from the
Treasury of the United States the annual proceeds
of the public lands, to be refunded by mcrea ed
taxation, or by contracting a new national debt,
which i« to go rn augmenting year after year, in-
terminably Sir, divested of (he plausible robes in
which it has been clad by the ingenious sophistry
of the mover, and its other advocates, it is a naked
and graceless proposition to borrow money for the
purpose of distribution among the State* Can
the people be prepared to sanction such a policy,
if that were the only question? Sir, I cannot be
lieve it
The'e views, Mr President, go to the expediency
of the propo ed measure, but there are other ob
jections of more insuperable character The Sena-
tor from Kentucky [ Vr Cwttendí-n] has said the
States have a right to demand a distribution under
the comracts be ween the ceding State* ana the
General Government. Now, sr, I hold that the
Sta'es have no right to demand—nor has the Gene
ral Government any right to make inch a distri-
bution It is, m my opinion, perfectly dt m'njtraole
that such an act would violate the teinu of ces
sion, as wed as the Constitution of the TJm ed
States, To sustain the first branch of my propo i
$ion, it is only neceisary to recur to the h sory of
ths times, and the language employed in the acts
of cession themselves.
To form a more satisfactory opinion upon this
subject, said Mr Clay, it wiilnot be unprofitable
to go a little back and examine the proceedings of
Congress antecedent to any surrender of territory
by the States It must be recollected that there
were two parties to these compacts—Congress, on
the one hand, holding out inducements and t nder-
ing propositions for an adiustment of territorial
difficulties, and the States, on the other, responding
to those propositions An examination of the pro-
posals and negot ations between contracting parlies
will always facilitate a correct understanding of the
contract itself. We all know that, even before
the cío e of the Revolutionary war, there were dif-
ficulties amongst the States in regard to the extent
of territory claimed by some of them There was
a vast amount of unoccupied and unimproved land
clawed by some of the States, while the others
maintained that, if the war terminated successful,
ly, and those wild domains were thus conquered
and secured, it would be accomplished by the united
patriotism, courage, toil, and blood of all the
States, and, consequently, they should enure to
the common benefit of all The Congress of the
confederation concurred m the view of the ques-
tion last mentioned, and on the 6th of September,
1780, agreed to the report of a committee, to whom
had been referred, for consideration, communica-
tions upon the subject from (he Legislatures of
Maryland, New York, and Virginia, ■which,
amongst other things, contained these views
If at H appears more advisable to pies& upon tin se States
winch can i emove the embarrassments respecm g tbe Western
countiy, a liberal surtendei of a portion of then lemioiial
claim1} since they cannot be preset ved entire loithout erüan

Now, sir, said Mr C there n not an idea to be
found in this report, so adopted by Congress, about
separate or distinct interests of the several Sta'es
Every motive held out, relates, in the language of
that patriotic body, to the safety and "stability of
the general confederacy"—to the establishment of
"the Fedeial Union on a fixed and permanent ba-
sis"—"to public credit and confidence, to th-> sup-
port of our army"—"to our tranquillity at home,
our reputation abroad, to our very existence as a
free, sovereign, and independent people "
This report, sir, was followed up by the adoption
of a resolution on the 10th of October, 1780, which
is expressly referred to by ¡he preamble to another
resolution upon the «ame subj«ct, wh ch was
alopiedin April, 1784, (after the cessims from
New York and Virginia had been made,) as '■'hav-
ing fixed the conditions to which the Union should be
bound on receiving such cession? " The former
may, therefore, be justly regarded as the fundamen-
tal proposition of the General Government—ihe
very basis of all the ces.ions which were made by
the several States, as they all followed after it, and
may b1 considered as assents or agreements to the
proposed "conditions to which the Union "-hould
be bound " Consequently, it must htve an im-
portant influence in determining ihe proper con
struction, to be placed on the several act3 of ces
sion, and I must beg the indulgence of the Senate
till I read it entire    It is in the following words
1 Resolved That the u ^appropriate 1 lands that m ty I e ceded
or relinquished to the tinned fetites by any i articulat State

fort*orgirusons within and foi the defence or in ac juirmgany
part of the territory that may be (eded oí i elinqmshed to the
l nited States, shallbe reimbursed
Now, sir, is it possible for any ingenuity or so-
phistry to put on this reso'ution a plausible coa-
«'roction, to sustain the idea of separate Mtetests
m ihe proceeds of the lands among ths Slates'   On
the contrary, is not the language plain and empha-
tic, that the lands which may be ceded to the Ge-
neral Government, "shall be disponed of for the
common benefit of Ihe United States''1—the name by
which this Government was callsd and known un-
der the Articles of Confederation, as well as since—
and and not for the benefit of the several Stalest If
any thing were wanting to establish more conclu-
sively, that the interest of the States in the proceeds
of the lands expected to be acquired under these
proposals, wa=, on all hand , understood to be
joint, and not several, it is to be found in the last
clause of the resolution, which specially declares
"that the necessary and reasonable expenses which
any particular State shall have incurred since the
commencement of the present war, in subduing any
British post, or m maintaining foils and gunisons
wilhm and for the defence, or vn acquiring any part
of the territory that may be ceded or relinquished to
the United State , shall be reimbursed "
It is a legal maxim, which the gentlemen en-
gaged in this d bate on the other side cansot fail to
recognise, that "exceptio umus, exclusio est altertus,"
and it is a principle of reason and common sense,
to which all mmds mu?t assent, that when a par-
ticul r reservation or exception follows a general
grant, the mere specification of the exception im-
plies that there is no other, and strengthens and
confirms the grant to all that is not reserved.
Th^n, sir, I am sustained in the conclusion that, so
far as the terms of the proposals to the States, by
the General Government, are concerned, we are
bound to appropriate the revenue, arising from the
sales of the public lands, "for the common benefit
of the United States," and not for that of the States
severally, with the singls exception that ' any par-
ticular State" was to "be reimbursed" for "neces-
sary and reasonable expenses" «Inch had been
"incurred" for the objects specified in the last
clause of the resolution
Having thus seen the obligations proposed to
be ttasunieti uy me General Government, let us
now, Mr. President, proceed to examine the acis
of the several States, purporting to cede or relin-
quish their claims to Western territory. And
here it may be well to remind Senators that all the
acts of cession, with the exception of those of
North Carolina and Georgia, were made before
the adoption of the Constitution, and, consequent-
ly, had reference to the Articles of Confedera-
tion It is fair to presume that all the States that
relinquished territory, were actuated by the same
high motives of patriotism and policy, and had a
common object m view, but as there is some dif-
ference in the phraseology of the several deeds, and
some of the gentlemen, who have addressed the
Senate, having laid great stress on the particular
words emploved in some of them, it may facilitate
us in makyjg a pioper construction to bring into
one view those clauses of each, wkich express the
purposes contemplated by the grantors I shall
take the deeds of cession in the order of time that
they were executed.
The deed from New York declares that the ter-
ritory ceded—
'Shall be and enuiefor Ihe use and benefit of such of the
United States as snail becoire members of the Federal alliance
of the sad States, and for no other use ox purpose whatso
eyer '
That from the State of Virginia declares—
That all the lands within the territory so ceded to the United
S ates (with certain reservations not necessary to be recited,)
shallbe considereda common fund for the uso and benefit of
=uch of the United States as have become or shall become
members of the Confederation or federal alliance of the said
States Virginia inclusive, according- to then Ubuall espective
proportions m the general chatge and e vpenditure and shall
be faithfully and bona fide dispose 1 of for that purpose and
for no other use or puipose whatsoever
Those from Massachusetts, Connecticut, and
South Carolina, adopt the same language, and con-
vey "to the United State of America, for their bene-
fit"—the respective States "inclusive " And the
deed from North Carolina corresponds wuh that
from Virginia The deed from Geo'gia differs
from all the rest m sevt ral respect1?, and shall be
hereafter noticed.
Now, Mr President, the question to be decided
is—do these several deeds respond to, and agree
with the "conditions" proposed by Congress, "to
which the Union should be bound on receiving
such cessions"—that is, "for   the common  be-
