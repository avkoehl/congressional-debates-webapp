at them, leaving small guards at the bridges above. If there are any block-house below Mineral Point at bridges not burned I will have them garrisoned at once, but I think there are none.

Brigadier-General MILLER,

De Soto:

I wish your whole force moved down to the three burned bridges, leaving only small garrisons at the several bridges this side. I want every possible effort made to reconstruct the bridges on the road promptly, and for this purpose you will use all your available command. We now occupy Pilot Knob, Bloomfield, Charleston, and New Madrid, and there is no rebel force within these lines. Your command, therefore, if it is to serve the Government, must work now and fight hereafter. You will retain your headquarters at De Soto or not as you please. If you do not go send Lieutenant-Colonel Maupin down and assign him to duty there and left Major Emerson accompany him. Call on me by telegraph for all the tools needed in the work. Answer.

DE SOTO, MO., October 12, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING:

Have just returned from the front. Nothing heard of any rebels. We crossed over the third Mill Creek bridge this evening, twelve miles south of De Soto. Will commence the next in the morning. There are three bridges burned there within as many miles, and we ought to have a force on each at the same time. With twenty-five men I can press teams to haul the material. Road is good and distance is short. At present rate of progress, it will take six to eight weeks to open the road. With plenty of help, I can open it in less than half the time. Will report fully by better by first mail. Can you not permit the mounted men of Colonel Fenn's regiment, about 150, to retain their horses until other men can be mounted to supply their places, then let the owners come for them. They are the only mounted men here, and their services are indispensable for scouting purposes in the front. Colonel Rankin's regiment can be mounted this week if you so order.

J. W. EMERSON,

Major Forty-seventh Missouri Infantry.
