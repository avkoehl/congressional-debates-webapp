THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 2,
connected by a road of iron ; the emigrant pro-
tected on the remotest frontier ; _ Territories
carved out of the wilderness domain; and new
States of promise and power added to the
national Union.
What other party in the history of this coun-
try ever confronted such difficulties? What
other party ever gained such victories ? But
great as its achievements have been, its work is
not yet finished. Out of the fierce conflicts
of the recent past, conflicts indeed still raging,
order and harmony, conciliation and friendship,
are yet to be evoked; not, indeed, by unwise
concession and timid compromise, but by that
firm policy which is based on Right, and under
the leadership of one, who, so terribly earnest in
war, is yet to-day the embodiment of peace, the
conservator of public justice, the hope of the
loyal millions!
The CHAIRMAN. All general debate is
now closed.
Mr. RANDALL. I want to say that there
is no truth in the remark of the gentleman
from Maine [Mr. Blaine] that the Republican
Sarty put down the rebellion. Had not the
democrats shouldered their muskets and gone
into the ranks the rebellion would never have
been put down.
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from
Pennsylvania [Mr. Randall] is not in order.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I move
pro forma to amend the first amendment of
the Senate, my object being to say that the
Senate has made two hundred and twenty-seven
amendments to this bill. The Committee on
Appropriations recommend concurrence in
about lifty of the amendments and non-concur-
rence in the remainder, so that they may go to
a committee of conference for adjustment. 1
withdraw my pro forma amendment.

tendent in the crypt, $1,440," and to insert in
lieu thereof the following:
For thirteen watchmen, including the superin-
tendent in tho crypt, at $1,400 each, $18,200.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Let this
be non-concurred in by the House, and let it
go to a committee of conference, and they
will have control of the whole matter. 1 think
it likely his amendment is a good one. The
section was non-concurred in to be sent to the
committee of conference, in order that it may
be made more perfect.
Mr. COBB. I hope, then, that the gentle-
man from Illinois will give my amendment
his attention.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I do not
know that I will be on the committee of con-
ference. I have no doubt it will be made more
satisfactory in the committee of conference.

ment will take the whole amount of the
$100,000 appropriated for these judgments in
the Coart of Claims, and there will be no
money left for small claimants.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. Mr. Chair-
man, it falls to my lot to represent the Oom«
tnittee on Appropriations on this question.
