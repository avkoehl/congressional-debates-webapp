J. S. BUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MOUNT STERLING, KY., April 26, 1865.

Captain J. S. BUTLER, Assistant Adjutant-General:

The dispatch brought in by flag is dated at Petersburg, Ky., April 23, and they are directed to await but three days to make terms. If you cannot accept terms asked for by them, I think preparations should be made to attack them. From what I can gain from deserters, they are near West Liberty, and perhaps this side by this time, variously estimated from 800 to 1,400. Deserters are coming daily, from five to ten.

H. N. BENJAMIN,

Major, Commanding.

MOUNT STERLING, April 26, 1865.

Captain J. S. BUTLER, Assistant Adjutant-General:

Outlines of conditions asked for: To be received and treated as prisoners of war; to retain all private property, horses, side-arms, &amp;c.; to be paroled until exchanged; to take no oath of allegiance to the United States Government, or to take up arms in its defense or against any foreign; to imprison officers of any grade or otherwise subject them to insult or violence; to guarantee our safety of life and property while in Federal limits, and give me us a safe-conduct beyond them to any neutral power whenever desired. We propose to be subject to all civil laws and military regulations established for the government of prisoners of war. Whenever the Confederate Government shall no longer claim an existence, we propose to return to our allegiance to the United States Government or remove to some other country, to which we claim a safe transit.

H. N. BENJAMIN,

Major, Commanding.
