May 13, 1862-11 a. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The officers in charge of the advance pickets last night reports that he heard distinctly the arrival of a number of trains at Corinth during the night, with re-enforcements. Such trains were greeted with immense cheering on arrival. The enemy are concentrating a powerful army. Halleck has here and on the way all the force under his command, and I believe be ought to have more to insure success at Corinth. Our army is in good condition. The health is greatly improved since they left the river and have been encamped in this high and denselywooded region.

Assistant Secretary.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Near Farmington, May 13, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

In compliance with your directions, I displayed large force of cavalry and artillery this morning beyond Farmington, and in one direction advanced to the railroad and in the other toward Corinth, crossing the first creek 1 1/2 miles below Farmington. Met no opposition toward railroad and only a few pickets in the other. Did the movement on the right encounter opposition?
