BERMUDA, June 1, 1864.

Colonel SHAFFER:

One brig and four schooners had gone to Admiral Lee before your dispatch was received. Captain Barnes has been here, and has returned to the admiral's ship. Nothing further, therefore, can be done.

FULLER,

Lieutenant-Colonel.

JUNE 1, 1864-3.30 p. m.

Admiral S. P. LEE:

Your envelope inclosing letter to French consul in Richmond, and request for the bark and schooners for obstructions, is received. Orders have gone out to Chief Quartermaster Fuller to send them up at once with a tow.

WASHINGTON, June 2, 1864-2.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

In the Field:

The telegraph line from Glucester to West Point, north of York River, has been cut, probably by the country people. I think General Smith should be directed to send a small cavalry picket along the line for its protection.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

BETHESDA CHURCH, VA., June 2, 1864-7 a. m.

(Received 8.30 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Yesterday afternoon an attack was ordered to be made on our left at Cold Harbor by the Sixth Corps and the troops under W. F. Smith, Warren, Burnside, and Hancock being held in readiness to advance in their respective front. The attack was made with spirit about 5 p. m., continuing until after dark, resulting in our carrying the enemy's works on the right of the Sixth Corps, where we still hold them, and also the first line in front of Smith. The latter, however, is commanded by another line in rear, which made those carried untenable. The enemy made repeated assaults on each of the corps not engaged in the main assault, bet were repulsed with loss in every instance. Several hundred prisoners were taken, but I cannot now say what number nor estimate ours or the enemy's casualties. During the night the enemy made several assaults to regain what they had lost, but failed.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
