man ever fought; his life has been laid on the altar of his country; his example in the regiment has ever been worthy of imitation. Adjutant Hodges nobly assisted me in the management of the regiment. Captain Curtis deserves especial mention; he fought like a hero. Captains Wilson, Burch, Hildebrand, Grund, and Getty did nobly. Lieutenants of the several companies did nobly with but few exceptions. The ever faithful Surg. J. H. Rerick followed us from point to point, assisted by Dr. Carr, and I am pleased to say that no regiment had better care for their wounded than did ours. He succeeded in getting all our wounded from the hospital, which was captured on Sunday evening by the enemy. My men, with but very few exceptions, deserve great praise and have earned additional honor and glory.
I also transmit herewith a detailed statement of the casualties in the regiment:

Killed ................................ 3

Wounded ............................... 59

Missing ............................... 10

Total* ................................ 72

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

S. C. ALDRICH,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Comdg. 44th Indiana Volunteers.

Colonel GEORGE F. DICK,

Comdg. Second Brigade, Third Division.

Report of Major Jacob C. Dick, Eighty-sixth Indiana Infantry.

HDQRS. EIGHTY-SIXTH INDIANA VOLUNTEERS, Chattanooga, Tenn., September 26, 1863.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report the following as the operations of the Eighty-sixth Indiana Volunteers since the 7th instant, on the evening of which it crossed the Tennessee River with the brigade at Bridgeport. The 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th, as you are aware, were only occupied in marching. Nothing occurred worthy of note until we reached Lee and Gordon's Mills, and during the 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th nothing occurred in our regiment that was not common to the brigade.

On the 18th, we were ordered out and occupied various positions in line of battle with the brigade until evening, when we were left in line on the left-hand side of the road about 1 mile north of the mills, where remained with the Ninety-ninth Ohio and Thirteenth Ohio, all under command of Colonel Swaine, of the Ninety-ninth Ohio, until 2 p.m. of the 19th, when we were ordered forward, and joined the brigade about 2 miles up the road, leading to this place, and with it went into action, and came out with the following casualties: 24 four wounded and 8 missing.

On the 20th, we went into action again with the brigade and came out with a loss 1 killed, 13 wounded, and 7 missing; the regiment was considerably scattered, and did not get together entirely until the next day [21st], at this place.
