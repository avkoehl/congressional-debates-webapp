SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 27, 1864.

General A. J. SMITH,

Jefferson Barracks:

What were you last orders to General Ewing? He dispatched at 9 o'clock that the enemy was advancing on him form the south and west. Carry out your arrangements under orders of last evening, and tell me if you are well and what you think.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

JEFFERSON BARRACKS, September 27, 1864.

General ROSECRANS:

I received your orders of yesterday at this point about 3 a. m. this morning. I telegraphed Ewing to evacuate Pilot Knob and fall back to Mineral Point. He started his wagon train at 3 a. m. for Mineral Point, which I fear will be caught. The rebels have made their appearance at Mineral Point, and I have ordered Colonel Mills to fall back to Big River bridge. Mills has three regiments. Do you approve? I have ordered the remainder of my division from here to Do Soto, and will be there soon.

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General.

JEFFERSON BARRACKS, September 27, 1864-10 a. m.

Colonel DU BOIS:

Please send forward the cavalry to De Soto as rapidly as possible. Colonel Catherwood reported to me at this point this morning, and will move on to De Soto.

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General.
