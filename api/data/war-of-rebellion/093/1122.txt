Captain E. T. WELLS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Sixth Division:

CAPTAIN: A report form the officer in command of the scouting party which went out toward Lewisburg and Cornersville, just received, says, they drive inthe enemy's pickets, uncovering a heavy column, mounted, and marched against them, also a heavy line of skirmishers, and a line of barricades being built, in length to cover at least a regimental front Jackson's brigade of cavalry camped last night at Bethlehem Church; the pickets and the reserves were driven in theirs side, but the barricade, column, and skirmish line were beyond the church. The captain commanidng the scout it of the opinion that the enemy was moving back toward Cedar Springs and eastward. The enemy is not making any demonstrations across the river at present, and, in my opinion, he does not mean to make a serious attempt to cross at either of these fords. A party of eight men of the Sixth Illinois Cavalry were just driven in to within for miles of this place on the Shelbyville road; they were bearing dispatches to General Hatch.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HORACE CAPTRON,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
