I would receive them at Port Royal Ferry at the day and hour named, but as you have given permits to some ten families to enter your lines, and as in your communication of the 11th instant you express a desire to send boxes of supplies, &amp;c., to the Federal prisoners of war, I will send a boat to the appointed place of meeting in the outer harbor of Charleston on Friday, the 23rd of September, at 10 a. m., if notified by you, upon receipt of this communication, that this arrangement meets your approbation. Should the day appointed prove to rough for the meeting, the following day at the same hour can be understood as appointed for the meeting.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GENERAL: In reply to your communication of the 11th instant, I have the honor to say that by the next flag of truce I will return to you all medical officers confined in this department, in accordance with the cartel and the precedents established between ourselves, but I do not understand that sutlers and assistant sutlers are comprehended in this arrangement (see article 3, Cartel, General Orders, 142, War Department, Washington, September 25, 1862). I will, however, exchange them for citizens captured recently in McIntosh County, Ga., by your naval forces.

GENERAL: ; In reply to your communication of the 13th instant, I have the honor to say that it will not be convenient to substitute the Savannah River off Jones' Island as a place of meeting for flag of truce between us. For ordinary purposes of communication Port Royal ferry is convenient, and where transportation is required the appointed place in Charleston Harbor, although liable to some interruption from rough weather, seems to me equally convenient and eligible to both parties.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
