General S. COOPER, Adjutant and Inspector General:

GENERAL: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram directing the release of all Federal prisoners held in close confinement or in irons, which has been carried into effect.

There is in Richland Jail, at this place, a prisoner styled Colonel Ackworth, a citizen of Georgia, of conscript age, who had been exempt as a practicing physician, and one, Captain Shad. Harris, whose case is fully explained in the accompanying papers. I respectfully ask instructions as to the course to be adopted in these two cases.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO H. WINDER,

Brigadier-General.

Nothing is known in this office of the case of Colonel Ackworth. The statement in reference to Captain Harris is substantially correct. The record of the court- martial proceedings in his case is on file in the Judge- Advocate's office.
