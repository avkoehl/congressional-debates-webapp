HARPER'S FERRY, July 21, 1861.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND:

I came here to-day. Yesterday Winchester and this county were abandoned by all armed parties. Johnston left for Millwood, to operate on McDowell's right and to turn through Loudoun upon me. I could not follow. The only active troops I have are the Second Cavalry, Doubleday's, Perkins', Rhode Island Battery, Second Massachusetts, Third Wisconsin (not fully equipped), Fourth Connecticut at Hagerstown, &amp;c., Twelfth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth New York. All others are barefooted. Their term expires in a few days, and I am required by General Orders, No.--, to send them home. Five regiments have gone; four go to-morrow, and so on. The Third Wisconsin will be placed temporarily on the canal, which parties have lately attempted to destroy, and will remain till I am provided with troops for active service. I have ordered the hospital depot, &c., at Hagerstown to be transferred to this place, but if your order me to you, will countermand the order. A large force will be required to defend this place against an active foe. I hear nothing of the Pennsylvania Reserves. Shall I join you with all my effective force, abandoning this place, sending home the three months' men, and my supplies to Washington?

R. PATTERSON,

Major-General, Commanding.
