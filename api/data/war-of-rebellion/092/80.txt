The casualties in front of Savannah were comparatively few-37 men wounded, 5 deaths from wounds. Fortunately, the season of the year has prevented any considerable increase of sickness while we were detained in the low and swampy grounds environing the city.

On the 23rd of December I transferred to hospital at Beaufort, S. C., under directions from Surg. John Moore, U. S. Army, the sick and wounded of General Hazen's division (Second Division, Fifteenth Army Corps), and at the same time the wounded Confederate prisoners of war, amounting in all to 150 cases.

On taking possession of Savannah, directions were given to continue the division hospital organization, the number of the sick hardly warranting, for the present, a greater expansion. Preparations have been made, or are in progress, by which the sick of the different divisions will be comfortably placed in buildings through the city. Abundant supplies, both medical and sanitary, are open to us at Hilton Head, and preparations are now going on for fully equipping the medical department with an ample supply of necessary articles.

At Hillsborough I came into possession of the names of certain soldiers belonging to General Stoneman's command, who had been wounded and left at or near Hillsborough, and afterward died. A list of these men is appended. I am happI feel convinced that they were well and kindly treated. They have all been buried in or about Hillsborough.

In conclusion, I must bear willing testimony to the zealous, faithful, and untiring care which our sick and wounded have received at the hands of the medical officers of this army. The length of march has made it a difficult, if not hazardous, matter to transport men badly wounded in ambulances; but the result has been most satisfactory, and the admirable condition of the wounded reflects much credit upon those whose industry and skill have so greatly promoted this result.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Asst. Surg., U. S. Army, Actg. Med. Director, Dept. of the Tenn.
