Lieutenant Colonel J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report all quiet in this vicinity. With the exception of a small party just returned from Aldie, nothing has been heard from the several scouts sent out in the direction of the mountains. No intelligence is brought by the party above referred to of any force in the vicinity of Aldie, or expected there. I have made the following dispositions here: Three companies have been placed at Annandale and two at Lewinsville. At both these points they are protected by a strong enveloping abatis, and at Lewinsville by a stockade inside of it. A continuous line of pickets, with reserves at two intermediate points, has been established between here and Annandale, and a line below Annandale to Edsall Hill. A line of pickets, with one intermediate reserve, has been established between this point and Lewinsville, thence above to near the Potomac. It is believed that the whole line is sufficiently closed from the Potomac to the Orange and Alexandria
