questioning it has been brought before this court. And yet I have had to leave my command and undergo the humiliation of this investigation on a charge in my case as baseless as it is senseless, and this in as intelligent a country as ours claims to be. The charge of treason is a fit pendent to the one of drunkenness and quite as true, seeing that to this day I have never drunk anything but water.

Is it not a bad symptom in the nation when such things can take place? Can its officers sustain themselves under such a system, and render that service which the country needs in its present critical state and must have as a condition of its salvation?
