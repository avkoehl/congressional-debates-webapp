APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

42d Cong....2d Sess.
Frauds in the District—Mr, lioosevelt.
Ho. op Reps.
"Answer. I do not know that it paid me pretty
■well; I saw one paper, called the Chronicle, which
has received $34,000 or $36,000 for advertising and
printing, and X saw in that paper these advertise-
ments published leaded, for the purpose of extending
them and then being measured and charged against
the District as if they were solid matter, for the pur-
pose of increasing the amount of the bill. .Page 326."
The following is an exact list of the amounts
paid the various newspapers:
Mr. Morris, of the Chronicle, (page 299,) "something
over" $10,000
Mr. Murtagh, Republican, (page 308)....  27,220
It is natural a Republican should get the
biggest share.
The Evening Star's bill, as stated by the Comp-
troller, (page 311,) amounted to $10,639 94
Mr. Burritt, Sunday Herald, (page 313)  4,492 45
Mr. Florence. Sunday Gazette, (pago 315).. 4,354 45
And very cheap at the price.
Mr. Hack, Critic, (page 316)  3,412 86
Mr. Koch, Columbian, (page 316)  3,100 00
Mr. Piatt, Capital, (page 317)  2,144 64
Donn Piatt seems to have gone dog cheap ;
he should have brought twice as much.
Mr. Forney, Sunday Chronicle  $4,853 54
Mr. Douglass, New National Era, (page
319)  3,262 75
A tribute to colored talent.
The Patriot's bill, as per statement of the Comp-
troller, (page 190)  $5,061
It really pains me to think that a Democratic
, journal would sell itself for a beggarly $5,000.
This tends to depreciate the party.
Mr. McGill, Georgetown Courier, (page325) $2,655 25
Mr. Hughes, Times, (page 325)  1,532 00
Mr. Collins, Grand Army Journal, (pago
334)  3,200 64
The Washington Anzciger, paid, as cer-
tified by the Comptroller, (pages 190 and
518) 12,796 00
Public Voice  42 00
The Public Voice seems to have been
drowned in the amounts paid to those who
were engaged in stifling it.
The above make a total of     $104,768 02
Add amount paid by Board of Public
Works from board funds, (page 450).... 5,187 31
Making a total for advertising of  109,955 33
Add amount paid for printing, as certi-
fied by comptroller, (page 190)  33,680 29
And wo have a grand total for printing
and advertising of  $143,635 62
" This amount does not include any printing done
1'ortheBoaid of Public Works. But in a table of
expenditures by said board (page 452) we find an
item of "books, blanks, and stationery," amounting
to $8,187 15. What proportion is for printing blanks
does not appear, but doubtless the larger propor-
tion ; which will swell the grand total for adverti-
sing and printing to more than one hundred and
fifty thousand dollars."
The watch-dogs, great and small, from the
St. Bernard down to the whiffet, being thus
brought up, the sheep were left a prey to the
spoilers, at the head of whom stood their own
Shepherd. The miserable excuse for such
extravagance was that the loan being _ so
well advertised would sell for a better piice,
while the fact was that with the exception
of a few of the leading journals none of these
twopenny sheets circulated a single copy out
of the District of Columbia, and scarcely any
within it. It was manifestly a matter of bar-
gain and sale with all such papers as were not
entitled from their position to expect to receive
the advertisement, and that included not more
than five out of the sixteen. The best proof
of the efficiency of this manipulation is shown
in the vote, the total cast at this election being
15,000 while at the prior elections it had been
twenty-six to tweuty-eightthousand.
Here were two potent influences for the loan,
first, intimidation, and secondly, subsidization;
but a third scheme more effectual than either
was put in operation which settled the niatter.
The government printed the tickets both for
and against the loan; it was therefore only
necessary to suppress the latter to secure vic-
tory and put the wishes of the people at utter
defiance. This was done with an unscrupu-
lousness which would have made a painted
sachem of the Indian tribe of Tammany blush
through the red ocher of his war paint. The
tickets for the loan were distributed the day
previous, and were abundant all through elec-
tion day at every poll, while the adverse bal-
lots were not to be had anywhere before mid-
day, and very few even then.
The law required the proper officials to fur-
nish these tickets; but they were deliberately
suppressed. The District ordered the printing,
and paid for it, but the people could not get
the ballots ; and instances were known where
as much as fifty cents apiece was paid for
them by those who wanted to vote against the
loan. Here was a monstrous crime, an
iniquity which, standing alone, would have
aroused the deepest indignation, but which is
hidden up and lost sight of amid the greater
crimes by which it is surrounded. It was a
fraud by the servants of the people upon the
very people who "had trusted them, and who
had put them in their places of trust—an open,
undisguised one, hardly denied, and treated
rather as a jest than as the serious matter it
really was. It most effectually determined the
fate of the loan, and secured to the Board of
Works an apparent indorsement to which it
was not entitled..
The expenses of this new government in its
various forms has been most onerous. In the
first place the contingent appropriations, ap-
propriations which should be guarded care-
fully, for they are the most likely to be im-
properly expended, placed at the irresponsible
disposal of the Governor and the Board of
Works, amount -to the enormous sum of
$200,000, which is more than is allowed to
any State in the Union by their respective
governments, and over ten times as much as the
State of New York. But still more flagrant
than this was the number of officers employed,
many of them being appointed by the Board
of Works without authority of law. Of these
the Board of Public Works appointed two
hundred and three, the Governor two hun-
dred and ninety-seven, (page 176,) and the
Board of Health enough more to make the
total list overrun six hundred, at salaries
which in the aggregate exceed six hundred
thousand dollars. This sum is over twice as
much as that of the State of New York, which
only costs $323,750, and more than all the
New England States together, and nearly forty
times as much as the little State of Ilhode
Island. This District, comprising sixty square
miles, with a population of one hundred and
thirty thousand inhabitants, and an assess-
ment of $62,000,000, has a government which
costs its tax-payers nearly six times as much
as the great State of Illinois with its fifty-five
thousand square miles of territory and two
millions and a half of inhabitants, the printing
and advertising being three times greater.
To make a complete and edifying comparison
I will now read a list of the expenses ot the
larger States of the Union, contrasted with
extent and population:

These numerous employ6s, amounting, as I
have said, to over six hundred, were mainly
appointed under what the board designate as
the law of necessity in default of other law,
the so-called treasurer of the board testifying
as follows:
" Question. Will you state under what law you ap-
pointed the officers for the Board of Public Works I
"Answer. Under the law of necessity.
'' Question. And fix their salaries under the same
law?
" Question. Is 'it a necessity for you to pay $4,000
to Mr. Mead, your auditor?
" Answer. Yes, sir.
" Question. I think you stated that you act as treas-
urer of the Hoard of Public Works, and that you
expect a salary.
"Answer. Yes, sir.
" Question. Do you regard that as a distinct ornee
from membership of the board 1
" Answer. I do.
44 Question. By what law?
" Ammer. As I stated the other day, by the law
of necessity. In other words, it is utterly impossi-
ble for any corporation to carry on its business with-
out the proper agents to do it. The organic law
makes the Board of Public Works disbursing agents
of appropriations made by the United States and by
the District government, and to disburse this money
they must have the proper officers.
44 Question. How many other officers are thero !
** Answer, Icannotspeakfrumrecollection; alarge
number. , , .
" Question. They wero all created by the same law
of necessity?
*' Answer, Yes, sir."
And nothing can better or more pleasantly
exhibit the easy views of these officers than
the following letter in reference to certain
" free lunches, " breakfasts, dinners, and teas
which the board of registration bad oaten at
the public expense, and of which even the
servile Legislature complained as an outrage ;
'Washington, D. C., June 30,1871.
Dear Sir: Absence from the city has prevented
an earlier reply to your communication of the 20th
instant, informing mo that " the house of delegates
has directed that a bill of items of each charge
made by the auditing committee of the board of
registration (of which I was chairman) should bo
submitted to the committee of ways and means.
Permit me to say that the auditing committee has
made no " charges." It did examine and, approve
some bills contracted by the board'of registration,
and, if I remember correctly, each of those accounts,
with the exception of that of Colone Owen for re-
freshments, contained the "items" of charges
against the board. Assuming, therefore, that jour
request has sole reference to his account, 1 will
endeavor to furnish the information you dosu-e to

tration, its members, thoir clerks, and necessary
attendants were daily provided with refreshments.

and nights, a period exceeding by two days the dura-
