No changes in the disposition of this command since last report. Five deserters from the enemy came into out lines during the night. One of them states that Davis' brigade, Heth's division, went toward Lynchburg recently. He belongs to Mahone's division. We had a deserter from Davis' brigade a few days ago. Two of the deserters from Sorrel's brigade, Mahone's division, picketing opposite the extreme right of the Second Corps, state they had orders yesterday to fire upon every one they saw, but that the order was not enforced.

Major-General.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Hdqrs. Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: General Miles suggests that the orders of General Grant, respecting the treatment of deserters from the enemy, be printed on very thin paper, and in high winds be let off from the signal stations. By that means they may find their way to the enlisted men of the Confederate Army. At present it is difficult to get them into their hands.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General, Commanding.
