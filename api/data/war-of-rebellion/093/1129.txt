NASHVILLE, November 28, 1864 - 10 a. m.

Major-General STONEMAN,

Knoxville:

General Grant telegraphs me from City Point last night that Savanah papers, just received, state that Breckinridge is now on his way from East Tennessee to Georgia to fall on General Sherman's rear. If you ascertain he has gone I wish you to penetrate into Virginia, if you possibly can, and utterly destroy the railroad for fifteen or twenty miles beyond the State line.

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

KNOXVILLE, November 28, 1864. - 5.10 p. m.

Major General G. H. THOMAS:

As near as I can learn from scouts and deserters all the mounted force Breckinridge brought with him is now in the vicinity of bull's Gap, say 2,500; a portion of his dismounted force, under Palmer, say 700, have gone back to Asheville, and Breckinridge with the rest of the dismounted force, say 700, with captured wagons and artillery, has gone back to Wytheville. Burbridge's troops will all be through Cumberland Gap to-morrow; they have ben detained by high water. I wrote you at length yesterday; have you received the letter?

GEORGE STONEMAN,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, November 28, 1864 - [8 p. m.]

Major General GEORGE STONEMAN,

Knoxville:

Your dispatch of 5.10 p. m. is just received. I have not yet received your letter referred to by you. I have received a dispatch from Lieutenant-General Grant to-day, in which he says that Breckinridge has already started from East Tennessee in pursuit of General Sherman in Georgia. What are your impressions about this? Do you think Breckinridge has already gone, or is even preparing to leave East Tennessee? Answer; I am desirous of learning something definite about this matter.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

KNOXVILLE, November 28, 1864 - 10.30 p .m.

Major General G. H. THOMAS:

Your telegram of 8 p. m. is received. A scout, a woman, and a negro came in this evening and report Breckinridge's force at Morristown and in that vicinity. I have two scouting parties out; will hear from one to-morrow. Breckinridge is no doubt now with his command; he had not yesterday left in pursuit of General Sherman, nor do I think he intends to. His command is not formidable, and he cannot get much the start of us. If he leaves this section to cross the mountains I will keep you informed. Burbridge is ordered forward.

GEO. STONEMAN,

Major-General.
