THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 6,
regard to extra numbers—goes to the Committee
on Printing, I suppose.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I think that should go to
the Committee on Printing.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The whole of it
goes to the Committee on Printing under the rule,
aq^ it was therefore stated that it required unani-
mous consent to consider the proposition now.
Mr. FESSENDEN. X think it had better go
to the Committee on P-rintmg.
The VICE PRESIDENT. There is no such
committee.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Then we can wait until
one is appointed.
Mr. B1GLER. I suggest that the first clause
of the order be adopted, for printing the ordinary
number. If it is desired, the other can lie over.
[" No objection."]
The fii'st portion of the order was agreed to, as
follows:
Ordered, That file message and accompanying documents
be punted.

ate a communication from the Secretary of the
Treasury, transitioning his annual report on the

gether with the usual number of extra copies.
Mr. FESSENDEN. What is the usual num-
ber of extra copies ?

A message was received from the Senate, by

The motion was agreed to.
COMMITTEE TO WAIT ON THE PRESIDENT.
Mr. FLORENCE moved that a message be

to join such committee as may be appointed on
the part of the Senate, to wait on the President of
the United States, and inform him that a quorum
of the two Houses is assembled, and ready to re-
ceive any communication he may be pleased to
make.
The motion was agreed to; and Messrs. Flor-

House.
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE.
A message was received from the Senate, by
Asbury Djckikfs, their Secretary, notifying the
House that that body had appointed a committee,
to join such committee as may be appointed by
the House, to wait on the President of the United
States, and inform htm that a quorum of-the two

DRAWING FOR SEATS.
Mr. SMITH, of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I
understand that the message of the President is
ready to be delivered as soon as the committee
of the two Houses shall wait on him; and as there
must, of necessity, be an interim, 1 move that it
be occupied in drawing for scats. I therefore
I move the adoption of the following resolution:
Revolved, That the Clerk of the House, immediately after
j the passage of tin* ^solution. place in a box the name of
j each Member and Delegate of the House of Repieseniatives,
written on a separate slip of paper ; that he Then proceed,
! in the presence of the lloiue, to draw fiom <aid box, one at
: a time, the said slips of paper, and a^ each drawn he
shall announce the name of the Membei or Delegate upon
it, who shall choose his seat for the present scwon ' Pro-
vided. That before said draw.mg sJinit commence, the
Speaker shall cause every seat to be vacated, and shall see
' that every seat continues vacant until it is selected under
! this, order; and that every seat, after having been ^elected,
j «hall he deemed to be vacant if left unoccupied befoie the
calling of (he roll is* finished.
Mr. DEWART moved that the resolution be
laid upon the table.
Tellers were demanded, but not ordered.
The House being divided, there were—ayes 87,
noes 99.
So the motion was disagreed to.
The resolution was then adopted.
Mr. FLORENCE. Mr. Speaker, as the com-
mittee appointed to wait on the President must
necessarily be absent, I wish that when their
names are called one of their colleagues bo al-
lowed to select seats for them.
Objection was made.
