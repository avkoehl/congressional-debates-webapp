HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,June 5, 1864-12.15 [p. m.]

General SETH WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have received Special Orders, Numbers 153 and beg to state that the Second Maryland is a veteran regiment, belonging to the Ninth Corps, just returned from furlough. It reported to me last night, and has been assigned to its division. It is a very small regiment, and I hope it may be allowed to remain where it is. It may not be amiss to state that his corps received none of the re-enforcements since the campaign commenced.

Major-General.
