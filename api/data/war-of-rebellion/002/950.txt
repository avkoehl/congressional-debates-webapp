Captain GEORGE D. DAVIS,

Palmer's Springs, Mecklenburg County, Va.:

CAPTAIN: In reply to your communication of the 22nd, I have to state that by the proclamation of the governor of June 3, all volunteer companies not mustered into service are called upon forthwith to repair to their places of rendezvous, there to be mustered into the service of the State. You should therefore proceed with your company to Richmond, armed with such arms as may have been furnished you, or as you may be able to procure, where you will be provided with such arms and equipments as are available. It is advisable, however, that you come as fully equipped as possible, as you will thereby hasten your preparation for the field.

Respectfully, &c.,

R. E. LEE,

General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Richmond, Va., June 25, 1861.

Brigadier General R. S. GARNETT,

Commanding Northwestern Virginia, Laurel Hill, Va.:

GENERAL: On to-morrow the two remaining companies of Colonel Fulkerson's regiment, viz, the Thirty-seventh, commanded, respectively, by Captains Gibson and Wood, and two belonging to the Twentieth, commanded by Captains Jones and William B. Bruce, leave for your command via Staunton. They will take will them two 6-pounder iron guns, with ammunition, two hundred tents, and the following articles of clothing, viz, seven hundred and twenty overcoats, one thousand pairs of socks, and six hundred pairs of drawers. I am informed by the Quartermaster's Department that at present there are no shirts on hand, but that the number called for in your requisition (five hundred) will be forwarded, together with the balance of the overcoats, as soon as made. By the Quartermaster's statement it appears that six hundred and forty-nine blankets have been previously furnished the troops under your command, and that there is not now a single blanket in store. In addition to the two hundred tents mentioned above, the two companies belonging to the Twentieth Regiment, and before alluded to, take with them twenty-two tents on Colonel Gilham's requisition.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General, Commanding.
