MAY 13, 1864.

Brigadier-General TURNER:

GENERAL: The general commanding corps desires you to make arrangements for supplying your command with one day's rations should you not have done so. The wagons should be sent back out of the way after the rations are delivered. The general also wishes you to send back for a battery (one you sent in yesterday), to be put in position so as to cover those right-hand roads by Howlett's.

Respectfully,

N. BOWEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
