I have just reached here on boat; I came from mouth of Beaver by order of General Burbridge. General Burbridge was at Pound Gap on the 5th. The line and railroad is cut between here and Lexington, and cannot go on as I expected. Collect all the troops you can, and stop all troops going through Louisville. I do not know the extent of the raid. General Burbridge reports it 2,500 strong, some infantry. Let me know what you have.
