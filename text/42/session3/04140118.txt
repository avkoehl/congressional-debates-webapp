j. and c. m. dailey.
. The next bill on the Calendar was the bill
(S. No. 868) for the relief of J. and C. M.
Dailey; which was read the second time, and
considered as in Committee of the Whole. It
directs the Secretary of the' Treasury to pay
Messrs. J. and C. M. Dailey $1,260 in fall for
food furnished the Sioux Indians in the year
1862, upon the application and request of
Mahlon Wilkinson, an Indian agent.
The VICE PRESIDENT. There is a re-
port accompanying the bill, which will be
read.
The Chief Clerk read the following report,
submitted by Mr. CoRBfiT*r, from the Com-
mittee on Indian Affairs, on the26th of March :
The Committee on Indian Affaire, to whom was
referred the claim of J. and O. M. Dailey for roods
and provisions furnished the Sioux Indians in Min-
nesota, in the year 1862, would report:
That Benjamin F. Pratt was a licensed Indian
trader; that in the year 1801 he formed a copartner-
ship with Messrs. J. and C. M. Dailey, merchants
doing business at St. Paul, in the State of Minne-
sota, under the firm of B. F. Pratt, for the purpose
of trading with the annuity Sioux Indians ; that in
prosecuting their business they built a store at Big
Stone Lake, Dakota Territory, in the latter part of j
the year 1861, and furnished it with gooda, and in
the year 1862 they built another store at Yellow
Medicine, and furnished that with goods.
There were no crops at Big Stone Lake in the
year 1861, and iu the winter about twenty-five hun-
dred Indians were gathered there and supplied with
food by Thomas J. Galbraith, the Government
agent.
On the 1st of July, 1801!, the Indians, began to
assemble to receive their annuities at Yellow Med-
icine, and by the Kith of the month there were about
five thousand there, where they remained until
about the l'Jth day of August, when they began a
war against the people of the United States, and
destroyed the property of traders.
In consequence of the outbreak the Government
confiscated the annuities due the Indians, and used
them to pay for property which they destroyed.
Upon the report of commissioners appointed by the
Government to ascertain the amount of Sioux dep-
redations. the Messrs. Dailey were paid <14,000 for
property destroyed.
As no authority was given for payment of losses
sustained by merchandise charged the Indians, the
Messrs. Dailey, for themselves and as assignees of
B. F. Pratt, now present   claim amounting to
$5,000 for goods, wares, and merchandise sold to tho
Indians at Big Stone Lake.
As all the books and accounts at boU* trading
posts we're destroyed hy the Indians at tho time of
the outbreak, it is difficult to obtain a correct ac-
count of the merchandise which had been charged
to them, but Duncan R. Kennedy, a clerk at the
firm, who had chargc of the businoss at liIs Stone
Lake, makes affidavit that about the 10th of Jmn-,
1862, he looked over tho books to ascertain tho
amount of credit given the Indians there, and ivhilo
he did not figure closely, his impression is that (he
amount was about fivo thousand dollars.
They base their claim for this amount upon the
ground that the Government confiscated annuities
due the Indians ; that their sales were made with I lie
consent and approval of Thomas J. Gal braitb, the In-
dian agent, and with an understanding both with lnin
and the Indians that they should be paid from the
annuities which the Indians wore to receive from
the Government, and that the Government did not
forward money to pay the annuities in time to pre-
vent the outbreak, by reason of which they were
unable to collect from the Indians the amount due
them. Nothingappears in the affidavit of Galbriith
whioh shows that he requested tho traders to furnish
any provisions or merchandise at Big Stone Lake.
While the Indians were waiting at Yellow Medi-
cine for their annuities, they were restless and dis-
satisfied. They commenced digging up and destroy-
ing gardens and killing cattle, so that the agentgnys
that it was absolutely necessary for those who had
provisions to give them some; that the Government
supplies were insufficient to feed them, and that he
told the traders to let the Indians have all they
could, and they did let them have flour, but how
muoh he does not know. This claim is for two
hundred and fifty sacks of flour, at five dollars per
sack, amounting to $1,250.
The books of Messrs. J. & C. M. Dailey, kept at St.
Paul, show that there were at least two hundred and
fifty sacks of flour sent from them about the 2d of
July to Yellow Medicine, and Duncan R. Kennedy,
who did the business of the firm, makes affidavit
that they wore received at that post.
The committee are of the opinion that traders take
all the risk of selling and delivering supplies to the
Indians; that the Government is not amenable to
traders for the non-payment of Indian annuities ;
and that the forfeiture of annuities must of neces-
sity be for the benefit of the Government, and not
for the payment of claims against the Indians. They
therefore report against paying the claim of $5,000
for merchandise sold the Indians at Big Stone Lake.
But as the flour was delivered to the Indians while
they were in a starving condition at Yellow Medi-
cine, and upon tho earnest solicitation and request
of the Indian agent, the committee report in iavor
of paying theclaim for floursodelivered, amounting
to 81,250, and recommend the passage of the accom-
panying bill.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a
third reading, read the third time, and passed.
EN OS J. PBNNYPACKER.
â–  The next bill on the Calendar was. the bill
(S. No.'395) for the relief of Enos J. Penny
packer.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Tl>js bill was
passed on the 26th of March, but tne Senator
from Illinois [Mr. Trumbull] entered a mo-
tion to reconsider the vote by which the bill
was passed, and the question is now on the
motion to reconsider.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I have no recollection
of that bill. I do not know why I moved to
reconsider it. I ask to have it read.
The Chief Clerk read the bill, which proposes
to relieve Enos J. Pennypacker, contractor for
the transportation of mails on route 5007, be-
tween Plymouth, North Carolina, and Frank-
lin depot, Virginia, from all charges and dis-
abilities as a failing contractor on that route,
and to allow the Postmaster General to adjust
and settle his account for Bervice on that route
accordingly.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Was there a report in
connection with the bill?
The VICE PRESIDENT. The recollec-
tion of the Chair is that it waa explained ver-
bally by the Post Office Committee. There is
a letter from the Post. Office Department
accompanying the bill which perhaps will
explain it.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Let that be read.
The Chief Clerk read the following tetter:

munication from the contract office of this Depart-
