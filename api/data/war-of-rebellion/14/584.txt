
early to-morrow morning. I have declined sending this brigade, as both its officers and men know the ground here so well, and if the enemy attack anywhere I think it will be here. I have informed him, however, that Griffith's brigade should be sent to him if he is pressed and that brigade is not absolutely required here, and that I have suggested that Major General A. P.

Your picketing, of course, under these circumstances is confined to infantry picketing to protect your front. It is designed to put Chaffin's Bluff under command of the Navy, if not already so commanded, and the attention of the authorities at Richmond has again been called to that point by the commanding general.
