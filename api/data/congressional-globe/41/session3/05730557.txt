THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
557
cersin the Navy range from $6,000 to $13,000,
and there is not one of those officers exercising
a jurisdiction or performing duties which are
in any degiee superior to those of the judges,
or which in fact equal them. For there is
nothing that these men can do which affects
the liberties or the properties of the citizens,
questions affecting which constantly come in
review before the judges.
I shall not trespass further upon the indul-
gence of the House ; but I submit that the
judges of the United States are not paid as
their services demand. I assert that they are
the poorest paid officers in the employment of
the Government; and I say that we owe it to
ourselves, and that we owe it to them and
to their families and to common honesty, that
we give them such compensation as will be a
reasonable reward for their services.
I desire to incorporate with my remarks the
following table:
