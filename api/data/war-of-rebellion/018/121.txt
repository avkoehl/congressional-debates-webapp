HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE RAPPAHANNOCK,Aquia, May 1, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Just before leaving opposite Fredericksburg I was told by a Union man that General Field's advance, consisting of a regiment of infantry and Walker's battery of artillery and some cavalry, was at the Sycamores, about 11 miles from Fredericksburg, on the old stage road to Richmond. This road is to the west of the railroad. Field's main body is at Stone Mill, which is on the same road as the Sycamores. His and General Anderson's force amount to about 6,000 men. Some of Field's are of recent levy and are discontented, and may leave him if they can find a good chance. The railroad repair has been delayed for want of iron from Alexandria, but is now going forward as fast as possible. One of the bridges of boats is nearly completed across the Rappahannock, and can be finished at any time in a few hours. Owing to the non-transmission of my telegram from the opposite shore, the remainder of McCall's division not march from Catlett's till to-morrow, instead of to-day, as ordered.

IRVIN McDOWELL,

Major-General, Commanding Department.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

May 1, 1862.

Major-General McDOWELL:

The President has directed the transfer of General Shields, with his division, to your department. You will transmit an order to General Shields, addressed to Woodstock, to move to such point within your department as you may designate (the President preferring Catlett's Station), having in view instructions hitherto received by you with respect to this capital, communicating a copy of your order in the case to this Department.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
