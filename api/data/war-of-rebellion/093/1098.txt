three rebels scouts inquiring for Captain Thompson's command. Rumors from citizens say that Forrest is moving on the south side of the river, but in which direction could not be ascertained; they also say that a brigade of cavalry and a corps of infantry was expected in Lewisburg this morning. The enemy drove in a small picket left on a side road, while this scout was out; other than this, none was discovered. It may be well to mention the rumor, as it has come through various channels, that Hood's main army is not before Columbia, but is crossing the river lower down, and moving on Nashville through Centerville.

Very respectfully,

HORACE CAPRON,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

Since the within was written the Sixth Illinois Cavalry passed down the Shelbyville pike toward Chapel Hill, and I gave the commanding officer the information herein contained.

Very respectfully,

HORACE CAPRON,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
