Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

The enemy are evidently making a determined stand between the two Annas. It will probably us two days to get in position for a general attack or to turn their position, as may prove best. Send Butler's force to White House to land on north side and march up to join his army. The James River should be held to City Point,
