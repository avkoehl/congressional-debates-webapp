Captain SEMPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Louisville:

Sixty-five rebels went north from Greensburg. All the roads are guarded. Hope they may be intercepted on their return.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, October 24, 1863-11.40 a. m.

Major-General GRANT,

Chattanooga, Tennessee:

From advices received last night it is pretty certain that Ewell's corps, from 20,000 to 25,000 men, has left Lee's army and gone to Tennessee, probably by way of Abingdon. As Burnside will be obliged to move all his forces up the valley, you must guard against Bragg's entrance into East Tennessee, above Chattanooga.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee, October 24, 1863-8 p. m.

(Received 5.25. 25th.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

All animals that can be spared will go back tomorrow to forage. One division of troops started this evening to Dave Rankin's Ferry, to seize that place, to enable Hooker to possess the roads to Mountain Creek. Once there we will have water communications to within 4 miles of here, and can supply this place with beef cattle, or have them driven here as required. Rations have been reduced. The enemy is closely watched, but if he should move against Burnside, or break through our lines between here and Burnside, it would be difficult in the present condition of the roads to follow. I will, however, do the best possible.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
