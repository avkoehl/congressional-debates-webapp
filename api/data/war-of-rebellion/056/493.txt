HDQRS. CAVALRY DIVISION, SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tennessee, December 25, 1863.

Colonel E. PRINCE,

Commanding Seventh Illinois Cavalry:

I send you the Ninth Illinois Cavalry, under Major Burgh. I have Morgan's brigade at Grand Junction with train of cars to move in any direction.

I have sent a battalion of the Second Iowa, 160 strong, from Saulsbury to Van Buren and Middleburg. You will fall back on Grand Junction, and not allow the enemy to push you toward Somerville, and then strike off to the left. Keep me well posted and watch them in all directions. I will re-enforce you at any point you may need it.

My opinion is they with to cross the railroad near Saulsbury.

Colonel J. K. MIZNER,

Commanding First Brigade:

Get your command to this point as soon as possible. I send you two trains; move such regiments first as you think best. I have a report from La Fayette that Forrest will attack Collierville, Chalmers and Lee Germantown, at daylight this morning.

B. H. GRIERSON,

Colonel W. H. MORGAN,

Grand Junction:

Forrest attempted to cross the Hatchie near Estenaula yesterday afternoon. The Seventh Illinois fought and drove him back to the river. Send out patrols toward Bolivar, Saulsbury, and south this morning. Hold your whole command in readiness to march at a moment's notice, either by rail or foot, with three days' rations in haversacks, and no transportation except ammunition. Have the engine fired up ready to move quickly.

There is no doubt Forrest is falling back before Smith. Keep Mower advised as far as possible. Watch the line from Pocahontas to Corinth.

I send 400 men to Moscow this afternoon. Grierson must never let go of him, but force him on to the infantry.
