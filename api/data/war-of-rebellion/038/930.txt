The enemy encompass my lines from right to left flank, occupying all roads. He has three corps; Sherman on my left, McPherson center, McClernand on my right, and Hurlbut's DIVISION, from Memphis, and Ellect's Marine Brigade(the last afloat). Enemy has made several assaults.

On the 27th, we sank one of their best iron-clad gunboats.
