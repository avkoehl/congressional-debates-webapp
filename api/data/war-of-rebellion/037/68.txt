works thus far. At this moment Major McCalla, of the Tenth Iowa, said, in the presence of the troops, that Colonel Boomer's last words were to let the rifle-pits alone. As I was acting directly under orders from Colonel Boomer, and had received orders from no other commander, also perceiving that the enemy had advanced on my left and torn down a flag of ours, previously placed upon their works, and afterward received orders from one of General Carr's aides to remain in position until dark, and then withdraw to the position where we first formed our line. After dark we withdrew our troops in good order and brought away our killed and wounded.

The loss in this brigade was as follows:

During the night we held the position where the line was first formed, and remained in that position under a heavy fire of the enemy until the 23rd, at 3 p. m., when we were ordered to return to the position now occupied, forming the left of the SEVENTEENTH Army Corps, the men being nearly exhausted by the hard fighting of the 22 d and watchfulness of the following nights.

All of which is respectfully submitted.

HOLDEN PUTNAM,

Colonel, commanding Brigade.
