Numbers 98. Reports of Colonel John A. Kellogg, Sixth Wisconsin Infantry, commanding First Brigade.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE, THIRD DIVISION,April 27, 1865.

CAPTAIN: In compliance with orders, I have to make the following report of the operations of my command from the 29th of March to April 25, both inclusive:

On the morning of the 29th of March, 1865, the brigade broke camp, situated near the military railroad about two miles from Humphreys' Station, and moved in a northwesterly direction, to a point about half a mile from the Boydton Plank road. At this point the brigade was halted and massed in column of regiments, right in front. Some firing being heard in my front the men were ordered to load, soon after which the command was moved into position in line of battle as follows: The Sixth and Seventh Wisconsin Veteran Volunteers forming the front line, in rear of the Second Brigade (commanded by General Baxter); the Ninety-first New York Volunteers, divided into three battalions, moved on the left flank of the brigade, ready to be deployed either on the left flank of the line of battle or in rear of the first line, as circumstances should require. The enemy being driven from their position on the Boydton plank road by the troops in my front, my command was moved to a position near that road and crossing the same, the Seventh Wisconsin Veteran Volunteers, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Richardson, being advanced to the road, the balance of the brigade being in line of battle about eighty rods to the rear, connecting on the right with the Second Brigade, under command of General Baxter, where we remained during the night.

On the morning of the 30th of March the brigade was moved to the Boydton plank road and threw up breast-works, remaining there during the night.

On the morning of the 31st of March, &amp; c.*

On the morning of the 2nd of April the brigade moved to the South Side Railroad, only to find the position evacuated by the enemy. The command without halting here moved on the railroad track three or four miles, the mile-board marking thirteen miles from Petersburg, when, by command of General Crawford, commanding division, the command moved at a rapid rate in a westerly direction about five miles, when the enemy were found in strong force in an entrenched position on the Burkeville road. By order of General Crawford, commanding division, I deployed in two lines on the right of the road, my right resting on a wood, my left connecting with the Second Brigade, commanded by General Baxter. The Seventh Wisconsin Veteran Volunteers, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Richardson, were deployed as skirmishers, with orders to cover the extreme front of the line of battle. By this time it was quite dark, and the enemy not being able to distinguish our uniforms, were at a loss to know whether we were Yankees or not, and before they had obtained the desired information the troops were in position to attack or resist the same, as circumstances would require. Upon ascertaining who we were the enemy opened fire upon my portion of the line; my men replied and immediately advanced toward the enemy, and halted within a few rods of their breast-works. The enemy ceasing to fire, I reformed my lines, and the men lay upon their arms until daylight.
