27th Cong....1st Sbss.                                Report of the Secretary of the Navy                                  Senate and H. of  Reps.
breach in the Pstomac bridge,    Soon after the
adjournment, an officer of the corps of topographi-
cal engineers, distinguished alike for his science
and practical skill, was selected to make the neces-
sary examinations and te report a suitable plan for
the execution of the work.    With what skill and
accuracy he has performed this preliminary service,
will appear from his report to the chief of the corps
The highest confidence being reposed the soundness
of his judgment, it was determined at once to ex-
pend no portion of the money placed at the disposal
of the department for the accomplishment of so im-
portant a work upon a plan which did not promise
to secure, what was held to be indispensable, its
permanence and durability.    Prom the statements
contained in the report of Major Turnbull, it is ob-
vious that the repairs, if done upon the plan which
formed the basis of the estimate upon which the
appropriation was made, could not stand through a
single season of freshet or ice.     The question was
then presented, whether it was proper to commence
the repairs upon the only plan which promised the
requisite strength and durability, but ihe cost of
which would far exceed the appropriation made by
Congress, and which, it was known to the depart-
ment, was supposed to be ample for the obiect, or
wait the sanction of that body at the approaching
session.   The great convenience and  importance
of the bridge at this point,  and  the strong ¡merest
felt by the citizens of this District that the repairs
should not be delayed, urged the immediate com-
mencement of the work,  while the questionable
propriety, under the prospect of us immediate ses-
sion of Congress, decided the department to post-
pone further operations until that body should have
an opportunity of acting upon the subject.   The
utility and importance of this bridge not only to the
citizens of this city and District, but to,the carrying
of the public mail, and to the Southern travel at
the season of the year when the river u obstructed
by ice, are so generally felt and acknowledged,that
I need say no more to recommend the additional
appropriation required, or that the sanction of Con
gress be given in some other form at au early day of
the session,to the making ot the necessary repairs up-
on the only safe and durable plan which presents
itself.
A practice has prevailed m the Indian Depart-
ment of making payments from moneys drawn
from the Treasury undsr appropriations by
Congress, without legardms, m all cases, the
objects of the appropriations as specified in the law
This practice virtually defeats that provision of
the Constitution which declare! that no money
shall be drawn from the Treasury except under
appropriations by Congress, lor the object of this
provision must have been not merely that money
shall not be drawn from the Treasury without
being duly appropnated, but that it shall bs paid
only for objecti specified m the acts of appropria-
tion.
The practice of making the payments under such
circumstances—that is, of taking money drawn
from the Treasury under an appropriation for one
object, and applying it to the payment of accounts,
and for objects for which no appropriation has
been made—renders the reports of the condition of
the Treasury entirely fallacious, and uttetly destroys
all confidence m them The true condition of the
Trea ury or of its liabilities, is not and cannot be
presented under such a practice.
, The Indian Department has favored itself in the
means of practising this irregularity by another
usage, directly in con ravention of ihe law of Con-
gress requiring that unexpended balances of ap-
propriations, at the expiration of two years, shall
revert to the Treasury. It has been customary,
before the expiration of the two jears, to withdraw
from the Treasury the balances not actually re-
quired for disbursement within the specified period,
and these balances have been placed in the hands
of disbursing agents, forming a very large fund,
Irom wmch payments have been made from time
to iime for objects for which no appropriations have
been made by Congress The amount of funds in
the bands of these special agents oí the Depart-
ment has ranged, on an average, from two to three
hundred thousand dollars for the last sevn or
eight years, and this has been generally depositeu
in banks selected at the discretion of  the agent
himself
Under these circumstances, the disbursing agents,
having received monejs under authorized heads of
appropriation, which have been applied to objects
not sanctioned by law, have had their accuunts
brought into such a condition as wll not allow of
their settlemen' at the Treasury without special ap-
propriation by Congress, and hence there are dis-
bursing agents who have been unable to obtain a
settlement daring several} ears, and wht se accounts
are still open, notwithstanding ihe act of Congress,
most salutary in its object, requiring a settlement
annually on the first of October.
As one irregularity is often the parent of ano-
ther, so, under the usage of the Indian Bureau, by
which large amounts of money have been held by
disbursing agents whioh should have reverted to
the Treasury, Ihese agents have had the means of
loaning, and have actually loaned, large sums,
within the last few years, to meet the necessities of
the Treasury m other departments of the Govern-
ment, or other and distinct branches of the Indian
Department, and, in this manner, a system of ac-
comm dition was obtained, without responsibility
and unknown to the law
The evils of the practice, the subject of these
remark*, will sufficiently appear when it is consi-
dered that they are precisely those which it was the
object of the provision m the Constitution prescrib-
ing the mode of drawing money from the Treasury,
to guard against; and those al o which were in-
tended to be counteracted by the law of Congress
requiring that unexpended balances shall revert to
the Treasury at the expiration oi two years.
In the present condition of the accounts of ais-
bursmg agents, it is impossible to ascertain the pre
cise amount of payments requiring appropriations
by Congress for their final adjustment at the Trea-
sury, but the amount is known, thus far, to exceed
$200 000 and it will probably require $250,000,
and po-sibly $300,000.
It would be easy to mu'tiply remarks upon the
impropriety of this practice of the Department. The
objections to it are numerous and weishty, and
some of them are founded <-o deeply m vital princi-
ples as to deserve «orne further notice of this repoit
All officers hold then powers m trust under
the ob1 gallon of fulfilling the objects for which
those poweis were panted Congress is entraste I
with the powei oí granting money for objects to be
accomplished bj Executive p^ents If the agents
divert the money to other objects, there is a breach
ot trust But as all the officers of the Government
are presumed to have m vew the eommon good,
Congress, more or less, relies upon the Executive
agents to indicate the objects requiring appropria-
tions, wah estimates of the amounts necessary for
their accomplishment This confidence in Executive
agents seems to have been regarded, m some cases,
as an implied authority in the agent to undertake
objects not yet sanctioned by Congress, the agents
looking prospectively for that sanction But if
tbi> discretion is to be tolerated under any pretence
whatever, for objects however apparently needful
or important, the checks and guards provided by
the Constitution and the laws are at once removed,
and the most dangerous experiments may be made
with the public money, having no higher sanction
than the judgment of the Heads of Departments,
while the discretion thus exercised at the fountain
is liable to become li-entiousness m the subordi-
nate agents, resulting in frauds and defalcations of
extraordinary character an4 magnitude
The attention of t^e Department has been di-
rected to ihe subject of Indian treaties, and parti-
cularly 10 the manner m which some of tho^e re-
cently made have been executed, involving the dis-
bursement of large sums of money for the emigra-
tion and subsistence of Indians.
The frauds that have been practised in the
Southwest have been to some extent inquired into,
but a full disclosure of all ¡he facts has not yet
been arrived at. Enough has, however, been
brought to light to e<*ablish a conviction that cer-
tain contractors have real zsd the most enormous
profits, the greater portion of which is believed lo
have been the direct fruit of gross fraud upon the
Government or the Indians, practised by bribing
some of the subordinate instruments in the public
emp'oyment, or through the mismanagement of
higher public agents, who can only screen them-
selves trom the suspicion of a «connivance m the
frauds by submitting to the imputation of gross
negligence, ignorance, or incompetency m the per-
formance of their duty.
From the involved character of these transac-
tions and the difficulty of procuring full and pre-
cise information, it has been found impossible as
yet to fix upon the pomt where these frauds com-
menced, or to ascertain the boundaries of responsi-
bility among the numerous public officers and
agents through whose direct or indirect instrumen-
tality, connivance, or ignorance the contractors
were able to consummate their unprincipled de-
signs. This investigation has been prosecuted with
the most painful reluctance, though persevered in
under a paramount sense of duty; and enough has
heen disclosed to suggest an mquny whether Ihe
guilty recipients may not be compelled to refund
their iniquitous gains to the Treasury by process
of law
All which is respectfully submitted.

To the President.
REPORT OP THE SECRETARY OP THE
NAVY.
Navy Department, May 31, 1841
Sir The appropriations made at the last session
of Congress will be found amply sufficient to cover
the expenditures for the current year, under the
several heads of appropriation, unless it should be-
come necessary or be deemed proper to assume
another and larger basis of operations than
that on which the estimates from the Dspartment
were founded
The state of the Navy Pension Fund will re-
quire the immediate action of Congiess. Under
the operation of the act entitled "An act for the
more equitab'e administration of the Navy Pension
Fund," that fund has been exhausted. It will be
seen from the accompanying íeport of the Com-
missioner of Pensions, ihat there will be required
for the payment of navy pensioners, on the 1st of
July next, the sum of $88,706 06, and on the 1st
of January, 1842, the further sum of $69,000. In
addition o these sum , about $6,000 will be re-
quired to pay arrears of pensions which will pro-
bably be allowed between July n°xt and the 1st of
January, making in ihe whole $163 716 06 To
meet these payments, there is wnhm the control of
the Department the sum of $28,040, leaving a de-
ficiency of $135,666 06, which the public faith re-
quires should be promptly suprdied
The sudden return of the Brandywine seems to
require some explanation. From the despatches
sent to the Department Dy Captian Bolton, of that
ship, it appears that ihe great excitement prevail-
ing in England m the early part of March last, in-
duced our Minister at that Court to address a com-
munication to Commodore Hull, the officer com-
manding the United States naval forces in the Me-
diterranean, the resulto! which was, that the squad-
ron, then lying at Maoon, left the station with a
view to get out of that sea, ascertain the true state
of things between the United States and Great Bri-
tain, and either resume their station or return
home, according to the result. The Brandywine
outsailing the Commodore, and Captain Bolton
having received no information on his voyage
deemed satisfactory by him, he returned to the
United States.
Though it is presumed Congress will scarcely be
willing to give attention to general matters uncon-
nected with the objects for which the extraordi-
nary session of that body was convoked, jet recent
events induce me to bring to jour notice, with a
view to the action of Congress, two subjects as
worthy of present consideration. The first is the
establishment of a home squadron. While squad-
rons are maintained in various parts of the wor d
for the preservation of our commerce, our own
shores have been left wuhout any adequate protec-
tion. Had a war with Great Britain been ihe re-
sult, as was at one time generally feared, of the
subjects of difficulty now in a course of adjustment
between that power and the United States, not only
