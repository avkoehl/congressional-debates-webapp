mately correct and to corroborate previous information on the same point. With a correct map the line could be exactly defined. The following sketch is nearer correct than any printed maps we have:

MAP

The house of Dabney and Hawks have been described and located by Skinner, who knows them well. The deserters, having been out with the working parties (one of them as late as last Saturday), recognized the houses from Skinner's description, and the direction of the works is determined by the fact that they run to the rear of and close to these houses. Working parties are sent out from the different brigades on the right and are erecting a line of works for a mile or more beyond the line of McGowan's brigade. One of information thinks it is not more than a mile beyond McGowan's to where the cavalry are working, but fixes it definitely at 200 yards beyond the Hawks house. A battery is being erected near and to the right of the Hawks house, which has been torn down to clear the range. (See sketch.)

Three deserters from the Ninth Florida, Finegan's brigade, came into the lines of the Third Division, Second Army Corps, this a.m. No changes discovered in Mahone's division. Also, three deserters from the Forty-ninth North Carolina, Ransom's brigade, Johnson's division, came into Second Army Corps this a.m. They locate their brigade on the enemy's extreme left between Norfolk railroad and the Appomattox. No changes discovered in Johnson's division. No general information of importance.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. C. BABCOCK.
