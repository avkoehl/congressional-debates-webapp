Passed Bentonville on the 11th, and with easy marches on the three following days arrived at Raleigh on the afternoon of the 14th instant.

This order was countermanded on the morning of the 15th, and on the afternoon of that day and the morning of the 16th the camps of the First and Third Brigades were removed to better ground.
