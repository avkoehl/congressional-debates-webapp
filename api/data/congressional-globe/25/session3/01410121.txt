CLAIMS OF VOLUNTEERS.
Mr CLAY, of Alabama, moved to refer to the
Committee on Military Affairs the report of the
Secretary of Wai, (Doc No 58,) in leply to the
resolution of the Senate, adopted on the 2d in-
stant, calling for information as to the time when
the claims of the volunteei s of Alabama, for horses
lost in the service of the United States, in the late
campaign against the Seminóle Indians, will be
examined and settled, and what fuither, if any,
provisions are necessary to a promptand just set-
tlement of said claims
Mr C also offered the following resolution on
the same subject.
Resolved, That the Committee on Military Affairs be in-
structed to inquire into the expediency of making further
provision by law for the more prompt adjustment and pay
ment of claims lot horses lost in the semct of the United
States , and also into the expediency of removing the hm
itation fixed by the War Department on the value of horses
lost m said service
Mr. C also remarked, in connection with the
resolution, that he wished to call the attention of
the honoiable chairman of the Committee on Mil-
itary Affairs to so much of the document to be
referred to the committee as related to restriction
indicated by the last clause of his resolution The
Third Auditor, in his report to the Secretary of
War, remarks:
" Your decision on the subject prohibits the allowance
for any cavalry, or wagon horse, in cases in question, of
more than one hundred and twenty dollars, the sum fixed
on in your letter to General Jesup of the 2d December,
1837," &c
Mr. C. remarked, that as regarded the Ala-
bama volunteers, and probably most of those from
other States, the operation of this restriction
would be retiospective,and consequently unjust
He said he believed the Alabama volunteers had
been mustered into service before the promulga
tion of this rule, and, of couise, without any
knowledge of its existence, and it would operate
with extieme hardship on those who had carried
into the public service horses of gieater, or per-
haps double the value, to be restricted to the sum
of $120 It was (he said) with a view to prevent
the unjust operation of the rules referred to that
he had penned the last clause of the íesolution
he had submitted, and he hoped it would attract
the special attention of the committee
The resolution was then adopted netn con

to be engiossed foi a third leading, and, by
unanimous consent, was read the thud time and

Mr DROMGOOLE asked the consent of the
House to take up the resolution submitted by
him on Monday last, foi an amendment to the
rules, so as to substitute the viva noce mode of
voting by the House, -where it is now provided
to be by ballot
Mr   WISE objected.
Mr DROMGOOLE thereupon moved a sus-
pension of the rules
Mr WISE moved a call of the House.
Mr PICKENS inquired if the movei of the íes-
olution intended it to embraee the cases of elec-
tion of President and Vice Piesident'
Mr DROMGOOLE replied that he had drafted
the resolution expiessly with regard to the rutes
of the House only, which were adopted by each
Congress, and no such case as that referred to by
the gentleman could come on this session.
Mr ADAMS requested Mr Wise to with-
draw the motion foi a call of the House.
Mr WISE could not do so, for, on the adop-
tion of a pioposition of this kind, he wished it
fully debated in a full House
Mr ADAMS appealed to Mr Dromgooie to
postpone the motion to some future day, as, if
adopted, it would have an immediate effect upon
another subject—the modeot appointing or elect-
ing the select committee on the Swartwout case.
Mr DROMGOOLE could not consent to do so,
the less so as the principle had already been set-
tled by the House at the commencement of the
present session
A call of the House was then ordered, without
a division, and proceeded in until the roll was
called over a second time, when it was dispensed
with
The question then recurred on Mr. Drom-
goole's motion to suspend the rules, and the
yeas and nays were ordered on the call of the
same gentleman
Mi WILLIAMS, of North Carolina, moved
to lay the resolution on the table
The SPEAKER ruled the motion to be out of
