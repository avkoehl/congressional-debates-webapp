The total expenditures will be $67,702,8] 8, and
the receipts from all sources will be §58,950,445,
thus showing a deficit for this fiscal year of
$8,852,373. It thus appears that during the pres-
ent fiscal year, a year of great commercial pros-
perity, the ordinary receipts have been insufficient
to pay the expenses of the Government by over
$8,000,000, and that too at a* time when the ex-
penses of the Government have been largely re-
duced below what they were but one year ago. It
is very easy to see, it this system of finance is
persisted in, that the debt of this Government in
a few years will approach the debt of one of the
European Governments. It is impossible that
any Government can be properly earned on under
this system of finance. Therefore the argument
is perfectly clf ar that, unless a different state of
facts exists in the future, the present tariff bill
will be wholly insufficient to pay the ordinary ex-
penses of the Government.
This deficit is not merely temporary, but it is
permanent. During the present fiscal year, the
importations into this country will amount to over
$412,000,000, or from $40,000,000 or $50,000,000
more tluui in 1857—higher than they have ever
been before. Although the importations have
gono up thus to $412,1)00,000, yet they have not,
under the present tariff, produced sufficient rev-
enue to pay the ordinary expenses of the Gov-
ernment. We must, therefore, Mr. Chairman,
consider one of three propositions. We must
either diminish the expenditures of the Govern-
ment, increase the public debt, or increase the
revenue. I take it that no one in our day, or in
our generation, will desire to increase the national
debt. The idea that a national debt is a national
blessing is an absurd one, which should never
have been tolerated; and I believe that no respect-
able political party proposes that the Government
should go on as it has for three years past on the
public credit. I do not suppose tha£ any other
Administration than the present one*would tol-
erate the practice for three years.
Now, can we diminish the expenditures ? That
is the first question to which I desire to direct the
- attention of the committee. I have before me a
table, which has been carefully prepared from the
reports of the Secretary of the Treasury, show-
ing that the estimates of the Secretary of the
Treasury for the next fiscal year for ordinary
purposed readied $46,278,893. Including the in-
terest cfti the public debt, and the expenses of col-
lecting the revenue, and other permanent appro-
priations, amounting to $8,173,582, the total
amount estimated for is $54,452,475. But, sir,
to this is to be added a vast number of appropri-
ations asked for by the several Departments,
but which the Secretary of the Treasury totally
ignores. He declares that he wishes but for
§54,452,475; yet other Departments of the Gov-
ernment estimate for other appropriations to the
amountof$9,606,250. I warn my political friends,
if they vote these appropriations, they will be
placed precisely in the same position as in the
Thirty-Fourth Congress. They will be told that
these appropriations were the extravagance of a
Republican House, and were made in the face
of the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
although they were asked for by the appropriate
Departments of the Government. For the purpose
of showing the character of these estimates, I
have prepared a statement of most of them, as
follows:
Estimates of the Secretary of the Treasury for the service
of the year 1801 $46,278,8©3 56
Interest on the public debt....$3,380,021 34

nue liora imports  2,000,000 00

Among them are estimates for continuing pub-
lic buildings in the course of construction. This
is mostly for the Charleston and New Orleans
custom-houses, and for the Treasury extension.
These appropriations are asked for; and gentle-
men here, who will vote against this or any other
tariff bill, yet urge the pressing necessity of them.
But the Secretary of the Treasury, who should take
a view of the whole field of expenditures, totally
ignores them in his estimates. The Washington
aqueduct, the Oregon and Washington war debt,
the enlargement of the public grounds, and the
Texas mounted regiment, have be^n, or will all be,
pressed upon us, and yet neither is included in the
estimates. They will be voted for by the friends
of the Administration, and yet all know there are
no means provided for their payment. Gentle-
men will create the necessity for new revenue, then
generally vote against increasing it, and go before
the people clamoring about new taxes and tariffs.
They expect the Opposition to vote them supplies
for all sorts of demands, to furnish them revenue
against their votes, or they will pay the salaries
of their officials by increasing the public debt.
As an example, take the proposed regiment
of volunteers for Texas, which measure is now
pressed by the Representatives of Texas. Based
upon no official document, so far as I can learn,
we are asked to appropriate for that purpose
$779,000. The proposition was voted for by every
member of the other side, and perhaps by some
members on this side of the House. If this be
granted,then hei e is an addition to the expenditures
of the Government of nearly $1,000,000; and we on
this side of the House, who are desirous of rais-
ing the revenue sufficient to meet the expenses ot
the Government, will be charged with having ap-
propriated this large sum, not estimated for, al-
though nearly all ofus will vote againstit; and those
who vote for it will, in the main, oppose.all.meas-
ures to raise revenue to meet it. In my judgment,
the best mode to meet these new financial tactics is
to refuse all appropriations for all new objects Of
expenditure until some proper revenue is provided.
Mr. Chairman, there is also a light-house bill,
which has been, or will be, reported, and which
asks for an appropriation of $653,000. There is
a bill for the restoration of the mail service, which
everybody seems to be in favor of, and which •
will require over $2,000,000. Let me call your
attention to the cost of that measure. Although
our constituents in all parts of the country have
called upon us to increase or restore the mail ser
vice, yet I believe that the Postmaster General
did right in reducing it. It is the only reform in-
stituted by this Administration. Gentlemen upon
this as well as upon the other side should remem-
ber that their mandatory restoration will increase
the expenses of the Post Office Department over
$2,000,000.
In addition to these items, there is a bill pend-
ing in this House which I hope will pass, and
that is the bill for the construction of a Pacific
railroad, which will require $3,000,000 a year to
pay the interest upon the $60,000,000 appropri-
ated. In my judgment, it will cost much more,
lam willing to appropriate any amount necessary
to aid in building a Pacific railroad; but in our
present financial condition, it is proper and neces-
sary that we should look to the cost. The Dem-
ocratic party, in both its branches, at Charleston,
recently declared that that party was in favor of
the construction of a Pacific railroad. As we on
this side always favored it, we certainly should,
in framing a revenue law, look to this new charge
upon the public Treasury. Then there aie pri-
vate bills pressed upon us constantly. Upon this
hasty review of the demands upon the Treasury,
we cannot safely estimate that the expenditures for
the next fiscal year will be less than §65,000,000,
exclusive of the principal of the public debt. Can
this estimate be reduced without injury to the pub-
lic service?
I desire nowto say that the Committee of Ways
and Means, who have had charge of appropriation
bills, have endeavored, faithfully and honestly,
without regard to party divisions—and all parties
in this House are represented in that committee
—to cut down the appropriations to the lowest
practicable point; and thus to reduce the expenses
of the Government. I have before me a table,
showing that, upon the estimates submitted to us
by the Secretary of the Treasury, for the ordi-
nary expenses of the Government, we have been
able to reduce the amount about $1,230,000. It is
as follows:
