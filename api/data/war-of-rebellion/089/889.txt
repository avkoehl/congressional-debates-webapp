General WILLIAMS, Assistant Adjutant-General:

A deserter, just brought in from Forty-second Virginia, Terry's brigade, Gordon's division, Early's corps, says his division began to leave the Valley by railroad yesterday morning. Five trains got to near Petersburg last evening about sunset, and came to intrenchments near Bisseau's and relieved the troops there. His brigade was the first to leave. Got in the cars at Waynesborough. It was said Pegram's division was coming too. Don't know how many of his division have got here or whether Pegram's division have begun to arrive. The troops his brigade relieved moved to their right at once. He has been sent up to headquarters.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I transmit two dispatches+ just received. Miles has been advised to move cautiously after crossing Hatcher's Run. His right flank by the Duncan road and the one Hancock took is open, and he is nearer to the enemy that to us. Humphreys has been ordered to hold another command in readiness to move to his support if necessary.
