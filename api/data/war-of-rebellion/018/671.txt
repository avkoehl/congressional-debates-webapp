I did not find General Bayard.

SMALL FORD, NEAR MR. KELLY'S HOUSE,

Two miles from the railroad.

We are here feeding our horses. We can see the enemy's pickets about 2 miles the other side of the river. They seem to be scouting around. There is quite a force here of the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania.

Yours, respectfully,

JOHN WHIPPLE,

Major Rhode Island Cavalry.

If the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania is there can I recall my company?

DUFFIE.

Colonel SCHRIVER:

If I did not send anything to General McDowell it is because my operations were not done, but now I may give you some information. Last night pass by me, that is to say, 1 mile from my vedettes, 13,000 enemy, that is at Georgetown; they were going, I suppose, to Centreville. I follow just now their rear, and will, if it is possible, without engagement, capture some stragglers. From my position I see Manassas and Thoroughfare Gap. Some one are still passing through that Gap. I have on another road, which goes to Georgetown and to Pignut Hill, some forces, which did not yet return; see if they can see anything of the enemy. I will send you more as soon as the reconnaissance will be here.
