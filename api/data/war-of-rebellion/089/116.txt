HEADQUARTERS,October 7, 1864 - 3 p. m. (Received 3.55 p. m.)

Major-General WEITZEL:

The enemy, I think, will make a severe attack on you. Can you hold him? It will be about 4 o'clock.

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,October 7, 1864.

General BUTLER:

I can, if he attacks anywhere near Fort Harrison, but I have weakened my left very much to help Birney.

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,October 7, 1864. (Received 4.10 p. m.)

Major-General BUTLER:

It is now 4 o'clock and there is not the least indication of an attack on me. The unusual quiet is the only strange thing. I feel as if I could make a pretty good fight for a single line.

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,October 7, 1864. (Received 7 p. m.)

Major-General BUTLER:

Won't you please inform me what has transpired on Kautz's and Birney's front to-day, as I am ignorant of everything that has taken place there.

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS,October 7, 1864 - 7.30 p. m. (Received 8.05 p. m.)

Major-General WEITZEL:

At 6.45 a. m. Field's and Hoke's divisions moved to our right and attacked Kautz, driving him back, with small loss in men, but all his artillery. The enemy then swept down toward Birney, who, having refused his right, met them and drove them back, with slaughter; then Birney took the offensive, and, having inflicted a loss of 1,000 killed and wounded, and about 100 prisoners, now holds Kautz;s old line. Kautz does not say what loss he inflicted. Our loss is not one-eight of theirs.

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
