face of, the íesolution of 1816' His (Mr R's) pro-
position, on the contrary, was based precisely on
that ic o'ution and if it amounted, as the Senatoi
had said, *o the making of a compact with the
banks, then, consequently, that w as the charactei
of the resohhion He conten led that the p-a posi-
tion of th  honorable Senatoi ins a dneet uo!a-
t'on of the o'einn compact (it it w a-, one) entered
into m 1816 betwee i the Gov eminent and the
ban s, and which that gentleman played a conspi-
cuous pait m obtaining He (Mi R) would say
that it his ov\ n pioposit on was a compact, so was
the íesolutiíti of JS16 He would have the
Senator compaie the teim^ of tnat resolution
with Inose oí the plan He insisted that thev
were exactly oí the same charactei Pieciselv
the same state oí things existed then as now The
resolution ol 1816 was passed to compel the banks
to resume specie payments by a given day, and it
had the denned e Ject, although a disposition had
been ev meed by some of those institutions, not to
comply with the teims of the resolution Mi R
expre s°d his desne to esiablish by his bill a model
of leg] latió i foi tljfi States, and after repeating,
that precrelv the ^ame state of things existed m
1816, as at pxesenl, he concluded by asking
whethei it would be in ordei to strikeout the whole
bill under consideiation, and substitute his own
for it
The CHAIR said it would rot be in order, un-
til the question should hav e been taken on the
proposition then undei cons delation
[Here Mr Cathottn sent to the Chair theieso-
lution oí 1816, and doccted the Secretaiy to read
it and the pioposition of Mi   Rives ]
Mr C sad he wished this done in older that
the Senate might judge foi itself w hether or not
the proposition was in its teims like the i ^solution
Having been lead—
Mr RIVES said that, practicalli, he could not
see anj distinct on bet vein the resolution of 1816
and tm own proposition He was suie that the
gentleman (Mr Calhoun) would not accuse him
of any design to favor the Pennsylvania Bank of
the TJn ted fetates He certainly had no such in-
tention and it was hi  opinion that that institution
was not likely to be benefited by the adoption of
his proposition As he stated the other day, so he
would repeat now, that the bank was not desirous
to resume specie pavments, that it would not and
could id, on account of the commercial opera-
tions in which it had been engaged for the purpose
of paying its debts In his opinion, the bank was
not m a con htion to iecime specie payments He
declared it to be his cleat conviction, that Ihe leso-
lution of 1816 involved no compact, that the
whole subject of it was lc1*! to Congiess to act as
the) might deem piopei
Mr CALHOUN evplained w hat w as the state
of tilings e^ s mg when the Bank of the United
States was chai a d m 1816, and conten led that
Congiess w s p rfeodv mder-eident of the State
banks, pnd that ihPie wasni ason far holding out
in* mdi cmenttothen to resume sp-cie payments
His colleague had state 1 the other day that he con-
si lered thcie was a compact betwe n the States
and the Gem ral Go/cinment, and that it was i n-
pera ne on us to pay the fourth instalment of de-
posit Mo the Sates Now, he (Mi Calhoun) dif-
fetei' m op mon from his friend Notwithstanding
that the gen tit mm fnm Vi gima, (Mr Rives)
diet not tntei 1 to 11 o the bank by his proposition,
h" ("Vti C ) thought that such was its tendency
Wni'evet m gh* be the impression of the Senator
as t th s mn; a compact, he (Ml C ) felt assured
rha the le^al adv iseis of the ban1 would consider
it a camped, an! would establish that fret in the
Súmeme Cou t of the United States
Mi RIVES heic made some remaik (not he"rd
b> theiejxuter) wmch Mr CALHOUN ansaeied
by saying that the immediate object of the resolu-
tion of 1816 v.ar not to compel the banks to resume
specie pajinents
Mr RIVES said that he lecodected that the Se-
eie'aiy of the Tie->suiy m 1816, stated m Ins le-
port tnat it "was in object of the hi"he t importance
that the Sta*e banks, w hHi had suspended specie
payments, should be induced to resume them
Mi  R contártele 1 that the Senator from South Ca-
rolina had assigned no tcasoR why the Bank of the
United S ates w ould av  il itself of the piovisions
m his (Mr It's) bill In the ciruilai oí the New
Youc bankeis, it was stated that, from thein<bi-
mation the} had gatheied, thej entertained the ojn-
nion that the Bank of the United States must lesume
specie payments between the months of Janu-
aiy and March Now, where was the eu-
dence that it v ouW Mi R v cnt on to sav
that it was his firm belief, that if Congress w ould
name a day when the banl s ought, m justice, to
resume, there would bono difficulty as to the sound
banks resuming specie pavments Nothing had
been said to convince him that the Bank ot the
United States would íesume Lefore the other banks
The piobabihty, however, was, that they woud
resume about the same time
Mr CALHOUN said that the Bank of the
United States held, at this time, a most remarkable
attitude He «¡poke of Mr Biddle as being a very
able financier, as distinguished for talent and abi-
lity , in that re rect, as any other n this countiy, or
in Europe- Mr C concuned with the Senator
from Vnginia, that the bank was not at present
disposed to re ume specie payments, and the
reason was on acaount of its strcngtn, having
more credit than any othei, and being cupab'e of
turning these times to advantage Mi Piddle
knew what he was about Pass the bill of the
gentleman fiom Vnginn, and we w ou'd veij soon
see Mi Biddle change his policy He would be
glad to see that bill become a Ian, ior it would go
tomciease his powei immei selv Mi Biddies
solicitude was lest a separation should be made of
the Government from the banks He knew
full v. ell that a Bank of the United States w as now
i ut of the que tton Until a sepal anon of th° Go-
vernment fiom th" banks toox pi ice, the whole
game would b~ in his hands But vhile Mr Pid
die [ccucluded Mr C] s niggles with ¿itat de
teimtnalion and fidelity fot the stocl holdeis
of the bank, I am determined to struggle
with no less zeal against that institution,
for I believe the interests of the people are antago-
mstical to its existence, and I wtll resist the intio-
duction of his bank m any form, as much so a? I
would resist the creation of a bank by the Govern-
ment itself I w 11 do my duty, unguided by party
attachment I shall act as a Senatoi of South Ca-
íohna upon this important occasion, looking to the
welfare and interests of mj own State, and to the
whole Union

INQUIRY IN REIA1ION TO THE 1*1 ORIDA WAR
The House then proceeded to the unfinished bu-
siness of the morning hour, which was the conside-
ration of the followin,, resolution, submitted by
Ml   Wis* on the 19th inst
Rewlved That a select committee be appointed
by ball it to inquire into the cause of the Flonda
n ai, and into the causes of the delaj s and failures,
and the expenditures which have attended ths pro-
secut on of that war, and into the manner of its
conduct, a id the facts of its histoiy generally, that
the said committee have power to send for persons
ind papers, and that it have power to sit in the re-
cess, and that it make report to the next se «ion oí
Co agre s
Mr GLASCOCK had moved te amend the fore-
going resolution bv striking out all aftet tie word
'' resolved," ard inserting the following
"That a select committee be appointed to inquiie
into the cause of the Florida war, and the causes
of the extiaordmart. delays and failures, and the
expenditures which have attended the ptosecution
of the ^ame, and all the facts conner i d with its*
history generally, and that said comm uee have
power to send tor persons and papers "
The question immediately pending, w s the mo-
tion of Mr Howard to strike out the woids " That
a st lect committee be appointed," and insert "That
the Committee on Military Affairs be instructed "
Mr BELL felt that when the opportunity oc-
curred, he should not let it pass in addressing' a
iew remarks 10 the House connected with the sub-
ject under consideration He thought it apparent
to every member of the House, and every indivi-
dual in the country, that this subject required some
attention and investigaron Some inquiry was de-
manded by the extraordinary circumstances con-
nected with it He cared not so much how the
inquiry w as instituted, provided it was instituted m
such way as to bung 10 hgbt the secrets connected
w ith it, which had been withheld from the Ameri-
can peop'e, he might say, the secrets connected
with the weakness of the Government meanvmg
on this war He had heard no gentleman object
to this, or say that the investigation should not be
had Some gentlemen had said that the committee
should be appointed m theordmarv waj, that is by
the Speaker of the House Here a question of
some tlehcacy was pre ented It w as a difficulty
which everj gentleman was not willing to encouti-
tet, and the Chan w as entitled to the foibearance
oí both parties in the House m leletence to the ap-
pointment of the committee, because it was a mat-
ter of great responsibility, and one which eiery
gentleman who tilled the Chair, he believed, wou'd
be w ill ng to evade if it could be dene consistent
with duty He thought however, that this ques-
tion might be discus ed without any delicacy
For several year* past it had be"n the practice, and
foi a few years it had been moie rigicPy adhered to
than foimeilv, to constitute the commi tees of the
House in such manner a to give a prepondciance
in iavor of the idnainisirati n or the paity in
power, but he did not know that it would be proper
to ehaige this a« a dereliction of duty on the part
of the Chair, as it was only following out the de-
mocratic usage foi some years back He took it,
however, that a more full and fair investigation
might be had by ra sing the committee in the way
proposed bv the gentleman from Ynginia, name1y,
by ballot It was expected by the country that a
proper and thorough investigation of this matter
should be had without reference to party But if the
Chair is to make the appointment of the committee
in compl anee with usage, he would ask whethei
more was to be expected than had heretofoie been te-
ceived irom investigating committees of this kind
We could not expect greater diselosur s than we
have received from formermvestigalingcommittecs,
which have turned out generally to be complete
failuies Now, under these circumstances, he
would ask whether it would not be pioper to re-
leve the Chair from the íesponsibili } of ma g
this appointment because, in cas" cf its fa mi o
the o hum would rest upon him of i ot having
aiponted a proper committed I he gel lema i
from Gcoisna, (Mi Glascock) on a loimer dny,
had thrown out the suggestion, and again lepeated
it on jesterdav, th/it it was proper that the Chan
should "ppoint the comm ttee so that all the
commanding geneials ergaged in the campaign
might have a representative upon it Now, he
would take the appointment from th  Chair for the
very purpose of preventing these often, from
having their friends on the committee, who m ght
improperly favor so ne and censuie others He
would give the appointment to the impartial senti-
ment of the House, to be exercised eitb°r bv secret
ba'lot, or vna wee, if gentlemen desired He did
not desire to have pad cd commit ees ra favoi
of any particular generals, or of the admin «-
tratton So fai as he him«elf was concerned,
he would not out a parn'an of either of the
commanding aeneials on the committee He
would have it cons tuted of men of business
habits, but men who weie not the puson il
nendsof either of the officers who migh sustain
one and dimini* the fame of othei He el d nt t
go for the mqutrj, for the purpose of raising lha
charactei of any individual, hot ior the purpose t f
