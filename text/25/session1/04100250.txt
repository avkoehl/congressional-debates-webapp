Glory to the gold-currency inen who have pi >ged
' themselves nto the quagmire of a Govern nent
paper money system, and m the first jear of the
administration of Piesident Van Buren, exh bit to
us a bankrupt Treasur>, to be relieved only by
contracting a national debt'
Pl/BLIC DISIRESS
Mr Chairman, not only dots the Presideht pro-
pose nothing for the relief oí the people n their
overwhelming distress, but he proceeds to speak o'
the public difhculti&s a* " the rev ulsion thr >ugh
which we have just parsed." Is it a levulsion
through which we have passed1 lb the Go/em-
inent at ea^e1 Have the banks resumed cash
payments 1 Has the exportation of specie ceased'
Has trade revived t Has cotton regained its old
price ^ Are the manufactures and the commeice
of the country restored to thtir lormei prosperous
activity1 If not, why are we told that it is a
revulsion which we have passed thtough 1
Let us look into this revulsion It is now Sep-
tember. On the 4th day of March last, only six
months aso, the late President oí the United States,
in language of seemingly well-grounded self-gratu-
lation, told us, in his Faiewe'l Address, of the hap-
piness and prosperity ot the United States How
stand things now1 Beginning with insolvencies
among the merchants, and proceeding to the stop-
page of specie payments by the banks, the country
has gone through aseries of commeicial and finan-
cial disasteis unexampled in the time ot peace,
in the history of this or anv othtr nation, u ltd we
ar« brought here, to be told by the Secretary of the
Treasury that the Government of the United States,
which at the beginning of the year possessed a
clear surplus treasure ot forty-two millions, is now
utterly destitute of fund-., and can not get on with-
out a bleach of contract with the States, and the
issue of ten millions of paper money to meet the
daily exigencies of the Tieasurv
Such are the facts on the face ot thing- Now
what, in the first place, are the causes of all this,
so etaborately expounded in the Message i
CAUStSOF PUBLIC DISTIUSS
The President says, and I believe him, that in
spite of " the passions and conflicts of party,"
these causes can not fail to be fairlv understood,

great conflagration m New York, the translei ot

bink  discounts1    r r  these   are  the ev's which
constitute the burlen of the Message
It i all matter of unquestionable history The
fact is notorious, that the increase of bmk capital
began simultaneously wrh the indication of a dis-
position on the part oí the late President to obstruct
the recharter of the Bank of the United States
Bank capital went on augmenting alongside of the
íemoval of the depos tes and the progiess of the
Executive war against the bank In 1811, the
number of State banks was eighty-eight, with a
capital ot |42,610,601, in 1816, the numbei had
risen to two hundred and forty-six, with a capital
of |39,822,4á2. In 1830, the number was three
hundied and twenty-nine, wuh a capital of $110,-
192,208, m 1837 the number (branches included)
was eight hundred and twenty-three, with acapitil
of $378,421,168, (Ex Doc 1836-7, no 65, p 208)
In the long period from the foundation of the Go-
vernment to the bfgiuning of the last admmis'ra-
tion, the whole number cf banks created was less,
in the proportion of 329 to 494, with capitals less,
in the piopoiuon of $110,192,268 to §268,228,900,
than were cieated in the seven yea>-s of that admi-
nistration. Nor is this a mere casual coincidence
of facts They belong to each other as cause and
effect That this augment ition of bank capital
was occasioned, oratk ast accelerated, by the adver-
sary action of the late Piesident against the United
Stiles Bank, is a thing bevond dispute It was
done professedly to supply the vacuum m the mo-
ney maiket anticipated to follow the death of that
bank It was urged as necessary to the success
oí the late President's policy Rival institutions
spiang up under the auspices of his "experiment,"
in the expectation of advantage from the Govern
ment deposites, which were even begged as a party
boon by minions of me administration
Not only do we know this to be so, looking
back upon the past in the ceiia'nty of actual ex-
perience, but the progress of events was distinctly
foreseen at the time, and the result unerringly
piedicted by the great men who opposed the wild
schemes of the lite President In the debates of
that da), Mr Webster said "Uneer a pretence
of a design to return to a currency which shall
be all specie, we are likely to have a currency m
which there shall be no specie at all. We are in
danger of being overwhelmed with irredeemable
papei, mere paper, repie^enting, not gold and sil-
ver, no, sir, repiesentmg nothing but broken pro-
mises, bad faith, bankrupt corpoiations, cieated
c reditoi-s and a mined people " Mr BiNMi.r said
"The project of the Secretar) oi the Treasnrv
astonishes me, it has astonished the country * *
ft is the clearly avowef design to bung a second
time upon this land the cursa of in unregulated,
uncontrolled Stale bank paper currency * * *
If ihe project shall be successful, we are again to
spe the paper missiles shooti lg in every direction
through the country, a derangement of all values,
depreciated circulat on, a suspension of specie pay-
ments, the.i a fuither extension of the same detes-
table paper, a still greater depreciation, with
failures of tradirs and. failures oi banks m its

mmated in the present crash Who can forget the
late President's "elf-satisfied addiction to his " ex-
periment1" Wi'h what headlong rashness he
assumed " the responsibility" of the disastrous
consequences, which he was warned would ensue
upon it1 Or the blindfold recklessless of coming
events, under theinfluence of which, in his farewell
address, he spoke of his " humbje effoi ts" to im-
prove the currency of the United Stales1
But the direct warfare of the administration
against the bank was not the only particular m
which it served to bring on the existing state of
things I am well persuaded that the removal of
the public deposites from the Atlantic States, wbere
the money had been collected, and where, in the
oouise of trade, it belonged, and its transfer to
State b«mks m the West, to be there discounted
upon, was partly instrumental fn producing the
fever of speculation in public lands, which the late
Piesident thought it necessary to check by the
Specie circular, and it was the unexampled demand
for public lands which filled the Treasury with iv
surplus, for the revenue from customs alone has
held an average of about twenty millions annually
for twenty years, and has not equalled the expendi-
tures of the Government.
The importations of gold by the direction of the
Executive were also pernicious every way Being
forced importations, contrary to the current of trade,
they increased our foreign debt, and so contributed
to raise exchange, and to depiess our staples So
far from diminishing the paper cnculation of the
country, as it was fancied the operation would do,
it increased the amount, by merely serving to en-
large the basis of bank-issues, instead of taking
their place It contributed to alarm the capitalists
of Great Britain, and to produce that panic action
of the Bank of England, to which the Piesident
jus'ly refers as one of the immediate causes of our
commercial embarrassments
Another of the conspiring acts of the Admini-
stration has been its loud cry against banks and
bank paper, the clamor of its presses and its public
men against merchants, their attempts to band the
poor against the rich, and to strike down every form
of the investments of properly, their schemes for
the overthrow of chaiters, all the radicalism and
jacobmical projects of disorganization, which are
so rife at this time, to the discouiagement of that
confidence between man and man, and that trust
in the stability of business, which are the very
life-blood of commercial prosperity.
BANK OP ENGLAND.
Sir, I do not justify, m any respect, the conduct
of the Bank of England m this affair That com-
pany had a dnect agency in producing the present
crisis England tempts us to buy, to incur a debt
on the credit of our crop, and then all at once ab-
ruptly cuts off that credit, and so strikes down the
price of our staples to a degree wt ich deprives us
of our ability to pay Thi<:,I admit, was iniqui-
tous il done with sinister motives, and was unwise
and impolitic in evprj point of •• ew The Bank
ef England, it may he, in a moment of panic, ex-
ploded the bubble But who blew up the bubble1
VTho caused that panic1
The Bank of England saw the Executive of the
Ui ited States embarked in a mad scheme to ovei-
turn the credit si stem of this country, and to duve
us back nto a s )ecie currency To accomplish
this, the Execu'i e was causing the indemnities due
the United States from France and Naples to be
remitted in cash Meanwhile the United States
had passed a law, in prosecution of the same nonet,
eban'ing the relative valie of fold and silver
Pi^ti uslj, silver bearing a higher legal value m
the United States, rdatnel) to gold, than it did in
Great Britain, was the practical stankrlot value
in this country, and the impoitanon of it did not
injur ously affect the money market of England,
or me trade relations between England and the
United States We had m fact, each a separate
ant dislmct specie basis fir our rcspecliye paper cn-
c ilations, she gold and we silver O i<- late law,
chnngmg the value of go) I, ie\erscd the old state
of things, and rendered ihe bank and business
paper of each country rnoie mdissolublj' connected
with that of the oth r than ever, and subject to
precisely the same fluotuanons.    When, therefore,
