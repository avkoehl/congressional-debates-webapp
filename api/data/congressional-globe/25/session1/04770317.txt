25th Cong..-1st Sesb.__________________Postponement of fourth insialmmt—Mr. Everett.                                              H. of Rep¡
which th is Govei nment, acting under the imperious law of ne
cessity, might be justified in refusing to comply with the clear
stipulations of then own taw, in refusing to pay over this fourth
instalment to the States But, m my opinion, no such case is
presented in the question befoie us I do not undersiand irom
the Secretary's lepoit that he means to say there is any defi
ciency in the funds of the Tieasury to meet the demands upou
it, if those lunds were immediately available But as a portion
oí" us means, consisting of money on deposite m the banks an^
a considerable amount in met chants' bonds, "cannot be imnie
¿lately realized m fund* suitable to meet existing apprepria
tions," ' it seems expedient, either m aid or exclusion of a re
ijoi'itjon on the .States, (as may be deemed must suitable by
Congress,) to provide some temporal y resouice, until enough
of the fourth instalment, or other mean? in the Treasuiy, can
be rendered available to discharge all the public engagements "
The pasaageof this law to withhold the nine million1* of dol
lai  now due to the States under the law of June, 1836, will not,
in the slightest degree, relieve the Treasury lroin its piesent
wants The money is now in the deposite banks, and the Se
cretaiy expressly say  that it "cannot be immediately realized
in funds suitable to meet existing appropriation*" Not one
dollai of available funds would be brought into the Treasury by
the violation of the faith of the Federal Government to the peo-
ple of the States, as solemnly pledged m the law now upon your
statute book The Secretary proposes that Treasury notps
should be issued, to meet the present demands on the Govt rn
ment Whether this bill withholding the money frsm the
States passes or not, the necessity for the is=ue of Treasuiy
noies is the same
If the deposite law is left to go into operation, the banks can
better make anangeroents to settle the claims upon them with
the Statts than with the Treasuiy of the United State** The
Secretaiyof the Treasuiy says, "many of the banks which
hold the money might be able more satisfactorily to pay it to
the States than to the Treasury " The amount paid over b}
them would be distributed among the pe  ple of the States, go
into the circulation of the country, and contribute, so far at
least, to relieve the embairassment of the community I do
fjot stand up as the apologist oi advocate of the pet banks
Theyweie brought into then existing relations with the Go
vernment without my agency or consent But the Treasury
poured its millions into their vaults, and it should not, by an
effbit to coerce them, further embairass the people Any pres
sure upon them by the adoption of me sures already originated
in Congress, designed to force them into a sudden payment to
the Government of its demand* weuld, directly or lndiieetly,
add to that burden under which the people of this whole countiy
are at this noment leeling
The specie drawn from the banks must be taken from the
people, who are their debtors That derangement of the circu
lumg medium, and that embarrassment of the whole business
of the country, embracing ait clashes and conditions of men,
irom thO"-e|who cam then biead by daily hboi to the mo t
opulent mt-j chants of the great conimerutl on Kb, would be
íendtred more severe and oppressive to the end that a few mil
Jions of speí le should be gatheied together and locked up m
the iron safes of Government offices until it should he wanted
to pay the salaries of the people's servants
Why should we, who are assembled to adopt measures to
alleviate the sufferings that are pressing our constituents to the
earth, lenrl our aid to measures which will tend at least to ag
grávate those sufferings'?
If this instalment m withheld, the expectations of the Sta'es
wiH be disappointed expectations created and raided by the
voluntary action of the very Government which is now about
to blast and destroy them It will operate a most serious m
convenience and injuiy to many of the Slates They have an
ticipated its reception and, in one way or another, it has en
tered into their airangemeuts—led them to embira in expen
give public improve menu and to mem obligation-, and \\a\i\\\
tie'', to meet which, without it, will subject them and then eitt
zens to great trouble and ernbarrasbinent
Mr B would again call the attention < f gentlemen to the
f-iot and he begged them to notice it, that whilst the immediate
pressing necessity of the Treasury was urged as the reason foi
the passage of the bill befoie us not one dollai of the money
which its passage could withhold from the States could be
made available to meet the present demands upon the Trea
sury It seemed to him, theietoie, that the momentary pres
uure upon the Government f<ii fundi-, which the ¡secretary tells
us ''is far from being any just cause for despondency," is
seized upon as a pietext to repeal the unexecuted} onion of
the deposite law wtien no pracln <d good, but much tvil, will
result from it Thesp (Mr B «aid,) were sume of the ron-tde
íatioii4* which hid operated upon his mind, and produced the
conviction ihat this bill ought not to pass—a conviction which
had not been removed by any of the aiguments which Vil had
heaid put forth in its favor He wished to see the fouith in
stahnens amounting to more thin nine millions, distnhiiLed
among the State- fulfilling the ju&t expectations of the people
created by the deposite law, and ten ling, as he helieved it
would, to íelieve them bom that cruel pressure undo whi h
they were groaning
Tne gentleman fiom Ohio (Mi Hamci) in the early part of
this debate, had admitted that the onus as the ta\vyeis«a> of
showing the necessity loi the passage of thi^bitl was upon those
who sustained K He called upon the gentlemen to c me Ü i

Treasury for them to accept thirty-seven millions of dol

and their agreement, in their high legislative sovereign capa
city, to receive the money upon the teims prescribed, and the
payment of three fourths uf the amount by the General Govei n
mentm part fulfilment of their proposition, altogether do not
constitute a cleat, intelligible, well defined contiact, such a con
tract as either of the parties, if they were amenable to the ju
dicial tribunals of this country, would be compelled to execute,
by all the couits m this land, from the lowest petty justice to
that which holds its ses&jons m the basement of tins Capitol

REMARKS OF MR. EVERETT,
Of Vermont,
In the Home of fiepiespnlatiies, September, 1837—On the
bill to postpone the payment of the fourth instalment of do
posite with the States
Mr EVERETT, uf Vermont, said he had attempted to ob
tain the floor when the bill was under discussion in committee,
and also m the Hou«t He had then Intended to submit his
views on the measures presented by the Committee of Ways
and Means for the relief of the Government At this late hour,
he «tiould coníuip himself to the bill before the House He
would submit to the House the effects its passage would pro
duce on the business transactions of the State he mpaitrepie
sented The I egisiature of Vermont, on accepting the terms
of the deposite act, made provision foi the immediate disposi
tion of the instalments, as they should beieceived They were
to be paid to the several towns in propottion to theirpopula
non tobe by them loaneo for the use of schools, under thedi
rection of town committees These committees werecomposed
mostly of faimers and the loans were made in limited sums,
principally to farmers and mechanic13 The time of payment
and the amount of the instalments being certain and fixed, the
business of the connti v was in advance, predicated on the ccr
famty of receiving the money The fouith instalment has, m
effect, been anticipated i hough not actually recen ed the
business of the countiy has been based upon it On the
faith of it debts have been contracted «n^asementsmade and
business undertaken The effect of di^appointi ig lhe«e well
founded expectations, to say nothing of I íshei obligations,
would be similar to that which would have been pjodmed by
a sudden call foi the same amount had no such expectation
been excited To the same extent it would derange the bus]
ness of the com tiy Toe «i me effect, he pn nm <i would be
produced in mo t ih ■  ill ¡hi St a «s ficmwhul üejuUir
dcOosite« h ne been withdi-iwn
Itis not to be di^ui^ed that the Mites in which there is
an amount of deposite greatly exceeding or even equalling,
the amountof their pioportion of the fourth instalment, have
mtere^fsdifTerentfrom those who have none, and those interests
have to some extent, been seen m the votes of this Hou«e In
the deposite States, the deposites continue to be thejbosis of their
bank circulation Ihose States aheady enjoy the full benefit
of the instatmentandof a laige surplus lie would now pie
sent the subject as a question of justice between the State 
The unavailable deposites m banks are principally   if not
wholly, m ten States Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, lennes
see Kentucky, Missouri Illinois, Indian**, Ohio and Michigan
Tne amount on the 30th of August was over nine millions, at
thi« time probably excoedin" seven millions   while their tro
portion of the instalment is   hoit of two mill) is  and three
iotyths     It h well undeis'ood that the  der o ne hanks cam rt
make payment, even withi i the time*-limited by the bill horn
the Senat    (two live and < i^ht mot ths,) or m treble that time
Is tt inst that these State" should retain foi almost an indefinite
time, the possession and use of the seven millions, while the
sixteen States havingnone but available deportes and even but
little of thepe ¡should have no equivalent  that the only measuie
of relief—that which they seemed tohave—should be withheld?
He did not desire to pr^s the deposite States  but, m his opi
mon, some meas ire \\as demanded which should inete out
somethmir like justice to the ne litor and debtoi States without
oppressing eithei   and he would appeal to the ^preventatives
of the deposite States, with what justice with what hope could
they isl the other sixteen Statts to s;ivc them furti ci time of
payment, if thoy insisted on the postponement of the f mnh in
staím^nt indefinitely  as proposed by th  bill, or until Decern
bei, 18^9 as proposed M ¡he aun u Ime it7
He wouH now state in what mannpr s nnethmg hi ** justice
might be done to th now deposite Stores and which I ting

Gentlemen wee not agreed on the state of the finances*
Muoh had been said about the intelligibility and non intelligi-
bility ot the Treasuiy repoit Though a more succinct report
would have been acceptable, yet, for one, he could say his chin
cultiesdid not anse so much from what was in the report as
hum what was not m it He could ascertain, with sufficient ac-
curacy, the amount of the deficiency of the present means but
was it not equally material to ascertain in what way the de-
ficiency eould be best supplied? It has suited the purpose of
the Secretary to ask Congress to furnish supplies to cany on the
Government to the 1st of January only, on a mere statement of
piesent cash means, with refeience to the actual means of the
Government, which might be rendered available, and without
relation to the fiscal operations of the ensuing year, and m
this limited view ot our financial situation, we aie requested to
postpone the fouith instalment indefinitely and to issue ten or
twelve million*. mTieasmy notes It might reasonably have
been expected that the Secretary would have laid befoie Con
gress statements similar to those usually made by a bankrupt
on calling a meeting of his creditors Wehadanghtiofxpect
not only a statement of our debts and cash on hand, but of all
our stsse s 'I he want of a statement of oui as«i ts has afforded
a convemt nt argument to the friends ol the bill Almost every
gentleman who has suppoited it has insisted that, if we pay the
instalment, we must cieaiea debt Ard the question is con
tmually asked, will the people consent to borrow money to be
repaid by dry taxes, ioi the t urposeof paying «to the States7
Even were it necessary to boi i o w money for that pm pose, why
should the Adrnmibtration shrink from the responsibility now?
The je=ponsibihty that ha  created the occasion~-the necessity
was boldly assumed No, they will not bonqw money, but
they will take it fiom the States, to avoid the lesponsibihty of
«, leating a debt—of borrowing money But to enable the Go-
vernment to pay this instilment, it is not necessary to cieate a
debt, to be lepaid by taxes It is only necessary that Congress
should convert its unavailable means into available means
All that ísa^kcd 1=, that wt should anticipate thedebtsnow due
(though not pajablt) to the Government This operation
would lequire no tax, it would impose no new burden on the
people
He did not ovenate the assets of the Government m estimat
ingthein atseventeen millions, e\clusive of the duties on wool-
lens on bond, (vvbuh, m ISew York alone, aie estimated at two
millions ) And oil that is required, beyond thr available means,
for theoreraiions of the Govejrinent and the payment of the
fouith instalment, is to lender fointcen millions of tins seven

mon<y undiawn foi m th* deposite banks (7,500 000) were now

held the powei might adopt them or not, as they should preflr.
The bill was in the hands of its fuends He was willing to meet
the measutes of the Administration in the shape and form they
chose to present them He did not desire to throw any embar-
rasen nts m their way by presenting amendments, either to
consume time m discussing them, oi to avert a direct vote on
ib< propositionsofieied
He leffretted that no measures of genera! and permanent re
lief had been proposed for the embairá sments of the country—
that the Government should have confined its measures to its
owa immediate r hef The whole country looked to Congress
