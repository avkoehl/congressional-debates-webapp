It is proposed in that case to send re-enforcement to you. Report what amount of stores there is and at what point, and immediately commence your preparations for defense.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., July 26, 1864.

Colonel RYAN,

Lewisburg:

Re-enforcement for you left to-day. You will probably receive definite instructions, but in our opinion you will be strong enough to act offensively or defensively as you may desire. Your reputation as a soldier depends upon your vigilance. Hang upon the rear and be careful to rest your men often.

J. B. WHEELER,

Captain, &amp;c.

P. S.-Wheeler and the rest of your staff friends have an eye tight open on you. We must do something.

CLARKSON.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., July 26, 1864.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

BLOOMFIELD, MO., July 26, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING:

Am out on expedition. Have with me battalion of the First Missouri Cavalry. Want to be out about one week longer. Cannot safely proceed further without them. They are ordered to Little Rock. Shall I send them back or retain them until I return? Send answer immediately. I start from here in the morning.

Lieutenant-Colonel.

BLOOMFIELD, MO., July 26, 1864.
