THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr. TRUMBULL. I withdraw any objec-
tion.
The VICE PRESIDENT. This will be
considered as agreed to, if there be no farther
objection. The Chair hears none.
Mr. SHERMAN. In regard to the other,
I will say to the Senator from Illinois that his
amendment which was added to the tax bill
had blanks as to the number of sections, and
we could not fill those blanks then, because
we did not know what the numbering of the
sections would finally be. The House of Rep-
resentatives adopted our amendment without
filling the blanks. This is merely to supply
that clerical omission.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair saw
at the time that it was impossible until the
engrossing clerk took possession of the bill
to tell how those blanks should be filled in the
port of entry sections.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I wish to ask the Sen-
ator from Ohio one question with regard to
this report for the information of the Senate
andthe country. I wish to know how much
in the aggregate this conference report reduces
the taxes and the duties ?
Mr. SHERMAN. This conference report
reduces the taxes, on the basis of last year's
receipts, $76,000,000. On that we have the
official statement.
bill introduced.
Mr. DAVIS asked, and by unanimous con-
sent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S. No.
1058) to settle and adjust all claims of the
Choctaw tribe of Indians against the United
States ; which was read twice by its title, re-
ferred to the Committee on Indian Affairs, and
ordered to be printed.
additional deficiency biiÂ«l.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I am directed
by the Committee on Appropriations, to whom
was referred the bill (EL R. No. 2369) making
additional appropriations and to supply the
deficiencies m the appropriations for the ser-
vice of the Government for the fiscal years end-
ing June 30, 1870, and June 30, 1871, and for
other purposes, to report it back with amend-
ments. I desire to say that tbis evening I
shall ask the Senate to consider the bill.

JOHN SHERMAN,
CHARLES SUMNER,
GAllKETf DAVIS,
Managers on the po,rt ofthe Senate.
ROBERT C. SCHEXCK,
SAMUEL HOOPER,
Manaytrs on the purt ofthe House.
Mr. SHERMAN. I desire the attention of
the Senate while I make a brief statement in
regard to this very important bill. The con-
troversy between the two Houses as to the
funding bill related principally to three mat-
ters : first, as to the description of the bonds;
second, as to the mode of negotiation; and
third, as to their operation upon national
banks. The House of Representatives pro-
vided for a four per cent, thirty-year bond.
The Senate provided for three classes of bonds,
at five, four and a half, and four per cent.
We have adjusted that matter by providing
for three classes of bonds of the description
provided for in the Senate bill, but have
limited the amount of five per cent, bonds to
$200,000,000, of four and a half per cent, to
$300,000,000, and the residue must be four
per cent, bonds running for thirty years.
Mr. TRUMBULL. A thousand millions of
four per cent, bonds?
Mr.SHERMAN. Yes; athousand millions
at four per cent. The second question was as
to the mode of negotiation. The House pro-
vided for no means of negotiation and no agen-
cies and no facilities. The Senate had proposed
the appointment of agents, and the advertis-
ing ot the loan, &c., and limited the expend-
iture to one half of one per cent. We have
agreed to a modification which places the one
half of one per cent, at the disposal of the Sec-
retary of the Treasury for the negotiation of
this loan ; so that in substance it is the propo-
sition of the Senate.
As to the national banks, we had a great
deal of trouble. The original section in the
funding bill, as it passed the Senate, required
that all the national banks should take the new
bonds in substitution for the old. There was,
as I think, a very unreasonable and unneces-
sary clamor raised by the banks against that
provision. I was sorry to see it. In the House
bill there was no provision made in regard to
the national banks. But when we came into
conference the House conferees themselves
proposed that the new banks to be organized
under the currency act which recently passed
should be upon the new description of bonds;
a provision which was manifestly just in itself
and not unjust to the banks. That was a prop-
osition made by the conferees of the House,
and we agreed to it. When the bill went back
to the House it seems that soma of the very
gentlemen who were so much opposed to our
section about the national banks attacked the
report ofthe committee on the ground that it
did not extend this provision in regard to the
new banks to the old ones. The contest thus
sprang up on the proposition proposed by the
House conferees, and the bill was defeated,
after debate, upon this proposition.
The second committee of conference, being
composed of the same gentlemen, had but one
of two courses to pursue: either to restore
the section proposed by the Senate originally,
which we thought was the better way, or to
omit all reference to national banks in this
bill. In view of the action of the House we
concluded that it was better to strike out the
seventh section of the bill entirely, leaving the
old and new banks upon the same footing, and
leaving the national banks entirely at liberty
to help or "to mar the funding of the public
debt.
I wish now to record my deliberate judgment
that in this conclusion to which we have been
compelled to arrive by the action of the House
we are doing the national banks a great injury,
which will impair their influence and power
among the people, and that the opposition of
tbe national banks to this provision, which
would have required them to aid in the funding
of the public debt, will tend more to weaken
and destroy them than anything that has trans-
pired since their organization. I do not see
how we can go before the people of the United
States and ask them to lend us gold at par for
our bonds, when we refuse to require agencies
of our own creation to take them ; when we
