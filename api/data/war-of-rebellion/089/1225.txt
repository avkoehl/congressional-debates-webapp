RICHMOND, VA., November 22, 1864.

General B. BRAGG,

Wilmington, N. C.:

If the condition of affairs will permit I wish you to proceed via Columbia to Augusta, to direct efforts to assemble and employ all available force against the enemy now advancing into Southeastern Georgia. General Hardee and perhaps Taylor and Beauregard are at Macon; Brigadier-General Fry, and perhaps Chesnut, at Augusta. General Lee will telegraph to you.

JEFF'N DAVIS.

WILMINGTON, November 22, 1864 - 9 p.m.

His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS,

Richmond:

I will leave by first train, but shall carry but few troops, most of these here being reserves which cannot be taken from the State.

B. BRAGG.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,November 23, 1864.

Major-General HOKE,

Commanding Division:

I am directed by General Longstreet to notify you that an early advance of the enemy is expected, and to impress upon you the necessity of having our lines worked upon as much as possible, and the picket-line strengthened by abatis, &amp;c.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Same to Generals Kershaw, Field, and Gary.)
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,November 23, 1864.

Major General R. F. HOKE,

Commanding Division:

General Longstreet directs that you extend your picket-line to the right, so as to reach a point near Battery Gregg, and thereby relieve a part of General Ewell's picket force. General Ewell's troops are required at present to be on picket every other day, and the duty is too severe upon them. If you cannot well perform this extra picket duty, General Field will be ordered to move up to his right and relieve a portion of your left, and General Lee also to extend a little to his left.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
