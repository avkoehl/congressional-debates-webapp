Estimate for agricultural blanks for 1870.
The bill under consideration provides that
vithin ten days preceding the date when the
census is to "begin a farm schedule shall be
left with the owner or occupier of every farm,
to be tilled up, returned, copied, and reported
in the mannar already described in reference
to householders' schedules.
In I860 the number of farms reported was
2.087.9"", and for this liberal estimate we will
allow for fifty per cent,, increase, making the
present number 3,056,9G3. The paper actually
used in returning the agriculture of 1860, for
one set of the returns, was 67.5 reams, or about
sixty-three farms to one sheet. The blank then
extended across the head of two folio pages ;
bat as prepared by the House committee and
incorporated in the penaing bill, it will fill four
paees, and would have required in 1860, had the
blank now recommended been then adopted,
loo reams of paper.
The farm schedule with blanks for all the
information required and ample directions upon
the back of the sheet would be one quarter of
a sheet of paper 18x26 inches in size. The
copies prepared by the district superintendents
will be provided with lines for entering forty
farms on one sheet; we have therefore the
heed of the following quantities of agricultural
blanks:
Beams. Tons.
Farm schedules  1,592 23.88 '
Blanks for copy  212.4 3.19 j j
Total actually required  1,804.4 27.07 I j
If the use of farm schedules were dispensed ;:
with, and both the original and copy made on ;
large sheets, there would be required 424.8
reams, or 6.38 tons. ;
We must allow for waste, and will assume it
to be ten per cent., as above. The result will
then be as follows :
1. Using farm schedules and providing ,
one copy, required 1,984.84 reams, or 29.77 !
tons. 1
2. Using large blank for both original and
copy, required 467.28 reams, or 7.02 tons.
Estimate for blinks used in manufacturing, \
mechanical, and mining establishments. ;
The pending bill requires that a schedule
with the inquiries embraced in the act shall
be placed in the hands of the owner or man-
ager of each establishment before the day ap-
pointed for the census, and that they shall be
collected, returned, and copied, as are the
householders' schedules. These schedules
would require one eighth of a sheet of paper;
and if special schedules adapted to particular
establishments, but reducible to the form of the
schedule prescribed, were supplied we should
obtain vastly better results, and might in very
many cases use paper of half the size otherwise
required, and thus admit of a great saving in
paper.
In 1860, 11.25 reams of paper were used for
one set of returns from 140,433 establishments.
Each page had 40 lines, of which, on an aver-
age, only about 12 were used, being about 2
lines to an establishment. The blank now pro-
posed would, as on the last occasion, extend
across one page. By the method of reporting
by congressional districts or territories, there
should be a great saving in the 28 blank lines
to every page.
A noticeable feature of the proposed change,
and one that requires an ample allowance, is
">e fact that formerly only those establish-
ments were reported that produced over $500
' uTaln,e' whereas it is now proposed to include
all. I here were 140,433 reported in 1860, and
will now admit, for a broad estimate, that
there are three times as many, or 421,300, or
®ore than one to every one hundred inhabit-
ants, or every twenty families.
. There would be actually required, accord-
10St0 the foregoing data, the following quan-

titles, if a blank is supplied to each establish- 1
ment and oue copy made:
Steams. Tons.
For separate blanks   1.65
For the copy 33.75 0.51
Total actually used 143.47 2.16
Or, dispensing with the use of previoussched-
ules, and reporting the original and copy on
large sheets, as under the law of 1850, allow-
ing the same waste of lines as then, the quan-
tity needed for the original and one copy would
be 6.75 reams; or 1.02tons. Allowiag ten per
cent, for waste, as on the former schedules, we
have:
1. With previous schedules and one copy—
Reams. Tons.
Schedules for establishments 120.70 1.81
Blanks for oopy  37.13 0.56
Total 157.83 2.37
2. Reporting on the plan required by the
law of 1850—
Beams. Tons.
Required  74.26 1.12
Estimate for blanks required far mercantile
and trading establishments.
As these relate to a class of inquiries that
are new to the census we are altogether with-
out the data of experience, and must assume
the premises upon which our estimates are
founded. Let the number of these establish-
ments be taken to be twice as numerous as i
those of manufacturing and mechanical busi-
ness, or 842,600, which would be equal to
; about two traders for every one hundred inhab-
, itants; or one to every ten families—a most
; liberal estimate—but granted for the present
exhibit—the blank necessary, and amply suf- ,
ficient for every inquiry prescribed, would be
half of the size ot those used for manufac-
turing establishments, and one sheet would
make sixteen blanks. They are to be distrib-
uted before, and collected after, the day fixed
for the beginning of the census, in the same ;
way as householders' schedules. The quan-
tity required for the 842,600 blanks would be
109.72 reams, or 1.65 tons, if none were
wasted. If copied on pages of forty lines, of
which on an average thirty lines are used, the
blanks for this copy would require 14.63 reams,
or 0.22 tons. Allow ten per cent, for waste,
and we shall have the following general result:
1. With use of previous schedules and one
copy—
Beams. Tons.
Separate schedules    120.70 1.81
Copy  16.10 0.24
Total     136.80 2.05
2. Reported directly by the enumerators in
the manner that statistics were returned under j
the law of 1850, required, 22.2 reams or 0.48 :
tons.
Total result for the four principal kinds of
blanks required.
This will be stated under four general head-
ings, namely:
I. Using a householders' schedule far entry /amity of
ji e persons, or farm schedule for entry farm, arid a
separate blank for every manufacturing, mechanical,
mining, and mercantile or trading establishment, as
the bill passed by the House and now before the Senate
requires, with allowance of ten per oent. for waste :

COST.
The paper that would be required, according to the
experience of 1850, would be 5,175 reams, or 172.5
tons, and at the present prices (S6 52i per ream)
would cost $33,766 87
Upon the experience of 1860, at present
prices, 3,249.69reams, or 55.81 tons, would
cost  21,204 23
Or, if taken to be 3,730.6 reams, or 55.81 tons,
would cost  24,342 16
For 1870:
First estimate.—Using householders' sched-
ules and preliminary blanks everywhere,
as the bill provides, (7,590.12 reams, or
113.86 tons)  49.525 53
Second estimate.—Dispensing with house-
holders' schedules among one half of the
population, but otherwise following tho
method of tho bill, (5,670.2 reams, or 85.05
tons) 36,998 00
Third estimate.—Dispensing with house-
holders' schedules among one half of the
population, enumerating the agriculture,
manuiactures. and trade by dircct in-
quiry, (3,964.47 reams, or 59.47 tons)  25,868 17
Fourth estimate.—Retaining all the sched-
ules of the bill, but enumerating directly
by the old method, without the use of
preliminary schedules of any kind,
(2,040.16 reams, or 30.62 tons) 13,312 04
These four classes of blanks (population,
agriculture, manufactures, and.trade) embrace
by far the largest amount that will be required.
For some of the blanks remaining, two sheets
to each enumerator, or 62.5 reams, would be
sufficient. For others, especially those re-
quired to be issued directly by the office, and
of which no duplicate is made, a few hundred
of a kind would be sufficient. For example, the
inquiries relating to railroads would occupy
one sheet. The number of corporations of
this kind embraced in the railroad guides is
about 600, and the number of roads under
construction cannot amount to half that num-
ber. The whole of these statistics could there-
fore be provided for by about two reams of
blanks. The same is true of most of the
other schedules of direct inquiry, the excep-
tional ouea being those of insurance and bank-
ing; but with the largest allowance they would
amount to but a few reams each. By drop-
ping one of the three sets of returns re-
quired by the law of 1850, and by liberally
extending the margin for waste, the whole
amount of paper required by the schedules ol'
the pending bill, if reported in the old way,
