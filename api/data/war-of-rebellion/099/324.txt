This corps being the extreme left of the army makes it necessary that the trains should be kept well closed up, and the troops well in hand and ready for instant action.

Rear-Admiral D. D. PORTER,

Commanding North Atlantic Blockading Squadron:

ADMIRAL: The rebels at one time had the guns of Fort Caswell in casemates of wood to fire through sloping embrasures, but subsequently, doubting if these embrasures would stand navy fire, took the guns out of the main work and placed them on the covered way. The question whether guns en barbette or in embrasure are most serviceable and reliable is a very important one in our harbor defenses, and General R. Delafield, chief engineer, U. S. Army, is desirous of having it tested on the embrasures of Fort Caswell. If you can spare a vessel for several hours' practice I should be happy to accompany it and arrange with the commander the details of the experiment.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. B. COMSTOCK,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Brevet Brigadier-General, Chief Engineer.
