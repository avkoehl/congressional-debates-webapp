gue it ftiiriy, should be informed of it He ahou'd oiove to
amend the amendment, by striking out the reasons, leaving only
the direct question of power involved He disclaimed a belief
or suspicion that the President had extrcised any power that he
did not believe he was authonzed todo In the first place, he
should like to know if there was any commission issued at any
time which, authorized an inquisition into tbe fact of an indicia
We offence having been committed by personam office and out
of office at the time of the examination, and next, whetbei any
commission had been issued which authorized the commission
era to take examinations moath, or permit examinations on
oath to be taken, and to call the gen'IemaVs attention to (he
question whether this was a subject of perjury He would also
like to know whether the commissioners had power to compel
the attendance of witnesses, and whether it was not necessary
to apply to Congress to get this power If this was voluntary
attendance, it was in direct violation of the statutelawsof JNew
York
From the whole exammition of this case, he should peifectly
acquit the President oí the exercise of any power he did m t
truly believe le possessed, and should vote for no amendment
to censure him, but wished to make it merely a question of
power.

raising these salaries by taxing the litigants He compared the
sum m the amendment, (which was all he could earn, if faithful,
because his ofjicial duties would take up his whole time,) with
what might be rereived by other district attorneys, whose offi-
cial duties allowed them time to enlarge then income by practfce
in the courts, and masted that it would be unfair to reduce the
salaiy ds proposed
After replying to some queries put to him by Mr Roosb
velt, as to the responsibility of this officer for defalcations
of his clerks, Mr F adverted to the enormous amounts received
by Messrs Price and Butler when filling the same office, and
the quietness of gentlemen on the subject, compared with their
present sudden zeal for retrenchment Still, if they could get a
man of competent standing, skill, talents, and. attainments, to
fillthe«fficefor$5 000, Mr F would not object to it Hispían
would be to revise the lee-bill, not to tax the litigants.
Mr ¡VicOLELLAN insisted that $5 000 was an ample compen-
sation, especially as the gentleman who filled the office C( uld at
tend the terms of the supreme court and the court of errors,
and thus earn with ease $5 000 more Mr C considered it per-
fectly /an to tdke the overplus of the fees of the district attor
neyofVew York t« help make up the $15,000 allowed for dis
tnct attorneys elsewhere He thought the fee bill was reduced
low enough in all conscience, when fixed according to the stand
ard of the supreme court ot New York He contended that
the principle of taxinglitigantswasperfectlyjustand equitable
As to $5 000 he -bought it was more than the district attorney
could tarn by fair labor, as such
Mr ADAMS raised the question of ordei whether this
amendment could be leceived, since it went to change tliesum,
not in the Senate's amendment, but in the original bill as it went
from the House?
After some explanations, the CHAIUruled the amendment to
be morder
Mr EVERETT said that the effect of the Senate's amend
ment would be to tax judicial proceedings m New York and
nowhere else The bestiemedy was to abolish all fees, and
substitute salar es He believed a constitutional question might
be raised on the matter, bbt it wasuot his province to deafm
such questions* he looked lorthis to another quarter
Mr JOSEPH R INGCRSOLL corrected the statement of
Mr riLi/vionE, as to the responsibility of district attorneys for
monevs passing tbroueh their hands The moneys formerly
paid to them w ere now paid to the maishal or, under the sub
treasmy law, deposited with the sub treasurei, who gave
tuphcite receipts foi it
Mi JONES replied to Messrs Fillmore and E\erbtt and
professed unwillingness to deal unfairly with the attorney for
the southern dibtuct of New Yoik Ifihc amendment piessed
hardly on that ofbrer its effect could be rpmedi^d bya-subse
quent an tndment, making his case an exception Mi J ad
mined that a former disti ict attorney in that district had receiv
ed as high a compensation as $28,000 in a single year, but as
soon as that fact was brought m an authentic shape before ihe
then Committee of Ways and Means (of which Mr J had been
chairman ) ih y f romptly applied a rorree ive, by reducing the
illnwance to SsGOOOa&a maximum All theofbrers! nf theÚni
ted S a[e.s connected with the distrnt courts, had received
enormous amounts of f3es A marshal hadrecewed $37,000, a
clerk % 19 000 and a district at'orney $28000 He thou htthe
restriction m the amendment would apply to more than one
officer He was amazed to hear the gentleman from Veimout
[Mr Everett] signiiy that to deal in consututienal questions
was not his province He supposed when a constitutional dif
faculty pre^nted itself to any gentleman, he was bound to no
tice it
Mr HOLMES inquired of Mr Joises whether any thing had
occurred to alter hia mmd as to the "alary of this officer which
he! ad himself, when chairman of theCommi'teeof Ways and
Means, fixed at $6 0001
Mr. TONES said it was the committee which had fixed it
at that sum heyieldedto thenujomy oí the committee, as he
ever should
Mr IIOLMHS then mferipd that the ^pntlpman had b^en
opposed in conclave to that sum? [.Mi Tones did not respond J
If it weie true that a foimet attorney haJ received S28000,
there must have been a vast amount of busmess done to earn
sue i an amount in fees Mr H dwelt upon the great amount
oflegal acumen and constitutional knowledge required of an

seizutea were continually made at the custom iiou , and the

Mr MASON, of Ohio, opposed the amendment, as gom? to
rob abor 01 its fruite If the fees did not amount to «¡SOOt

would only be in consequence of services rendered The pro.

Uemen said that this officer had leisure to earn «5 00O more by
his private practice If the gentleman who asserted this would
say it was from his personal knowledge, Mr M had nothine
more to say                                                                                 &
Mr McCLEIXAN explained He was satisfied that such,
was the case As to the «28 00O formerly received, it had not
been for personal services of the attorney, but for fees on lude,
menu by default, on which S70 was chaiged, instead of «6, for
omce work done by his clerks
Mr MASON said the sum had been fixed by ihat ¿entleman's
own amendment, formerly offered, at $6 uOO Yet now the gen-
tleman denounced that sum as extravagant
Mr McCLEIXAN again explained He understood that
sum had been fixed by the appropriation bill of 1811, and>out
of respect for his predecessors, he had followed the plecident
set him
Mi MASON thought the gentleman might show a little
mercy to the present incumbent, when his conscience had suf-
fered him to be quiet while his predecessor waa receiving
828,000 a year Doubtless tbe gentleman had repressed Its
stings with great difficulty [AJaughl These abases had betn
a standing topic of animadversion for four or five years; but
never could gentlemen's attention be roused to them till the 4th
of March, 1841, and then, Down with allsalaries1 Retrench!
retrench'   Shameful extravagance'
The question was now loudly demanded, and, having been
taken by tellers, stood as follows  ayes 67, noes 65.
So tbe amendment waa agreed to
Mr ROOSEVELT now moved further toamendlheSeiiate's
amendment, by reducing the sum of s^SOQ-Tor compensation to
the clerks of the circuit and district courts, to f2,$00 The
House had for neily voted that the duties ^f these two clerkships
should be pel formed % the same officei and had fixed Ins al-
lowance at butt2 500 ^Thereweie uowtwoofthem, and if the
allowance for each was Set at $2 500, tne whole sum formerly
proposed would be increased from S4Í0O to $5,000 As to the
case of the district attorney,, his mind |idd not been satisfied, and
he had not been able to vote either w£y, but as to tlipse gentle
men, he had no doubts ThWduliefe did not, like his require
high professional talent?, they wereéhiefiy of a mechanical char-
acter Ihe chief justice fk th|f State received but $2,500.
Why should the clerk of a ciAui/ court receive' nearly double
that sum! But, besides, the ataJndment of the gentleman ad-
mitted a construction which wcf^ld allow each of these officersa
deputy, under the wordt "other necessary clerk hire " The
clerk miaht have a flourishing broker's shop m Wall street;
might walk about with f-is hands m his pocket and a cigar in
his mouth, and take big ease, while his deputy wasdomg all the
woik Theseclerk* weie usually men of wealth, one of them,
at present in office, was said to be very rich He thought they
might be content to tiavel on runners, without being furmehed
with wings Mr R said he could not be charged, m this
movement, with being actuated by any political or party ends;
for the incumbents now in ofiice were of his own side m pol-
itics
[Mr Memwethbe here put to Mr R some merry question,
which elicited a good deal of laughter in his neighborhood, but
w'tich did not travel as far as the reporter's seat ]
'Ihe question having been taken by tellers, the amendment
proposed by Mr Roosevelt was agreed to ayes 76, noes not
counted
On motion of Mr YOUNG of New York, an amendment
was agreed to, requuing, in addition to the judge's certificate,
now required by law to the allowance of certain law charges,
that of the clerk of the court, stating that the bervices charged
were actually rendered
Mr McCLkLI AN proposed further to amend the Senate's
amendment, limiting the office expenses of the clerks of the cir-
cuit and diet] let couits and also the office of the district attor
ney, to $3 000 per annum, rent and all othei charges included.
Mi McC refeired i^ a precedent tor (hislimitation, to the ap-
propriating bill of Ml ard expre  edhis persuasion that, with
out some guau1 of thw Kin 1, great abuses would certainly occur
Laily in Marc i Mi McC had offered a resolution calling for
the annual leports leqmred by law of the district attorney of
trie southern distuct of New York, and the elerks of these courts,
in reference to their expenses, but no response had been receiv-
ed from the Tieasury Department, whence he concluded that
noretumi had been made to that departrren' and bencehe
supposed tint he allowance of $3000 would be suflic ent
Mr riLIMORE thought the amendment unfair mill , (bat
it proposed the sime limitation m theoffices ofthe districtattor*
ney and ti e clei^ of the courts Now, there was no analogy
between the two The district attorney had to employ abl*
counsel, whereas the otheis required the aid of mere copyists.
Pverybody could see that S3.OC0 would not employ counsel,
hire clerks, and piy ofiice lent Mr F contended that all this
Was poor economy Nothing was to be gained by the Govern
ment in 1ms treating a law officer at a port where more than
half the revenue of the whole Tin on was co'lected If gentle-
men weie unwil mg to nun to the integrity of the Au mors
hole, le thorn atlta-tforbear to fixthe enpensesof the district
attoi ney at «o \ erv low a 0um He hoped the gentleman would
consent to say «4,000 for the distuct attorney's expenses, and

Mr McCIELI AN «aid the district at'orney had ro rent

their ofiice in the same loom, and that was paid for by Unci 
asjr MORCAN doubted the correctness of this sta'emenf
Thelimted States had no public building m New loik but
the custom house these offices were not m the custom house
He presumed these officers had to pay rent
After a desultory conversation on ibis punt be ween ues«rt?
ROOSEVELT, MORGAN, and McKFON the question -vas
divided and taken separately—first in -espect 'o the ú «tnct at
tomev, and then as to the clerks of the circuit and Jistnci curte
3nd decided in both cases in the affirma ve
So the amendment was agreed o
