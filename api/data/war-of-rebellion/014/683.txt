General PENDLETON, Commanding Artillery:

GENERAL: I am instructed by General Johnston to say that he wishes you to march as many of your artillery command by land to the Peninsula as you can possibly get off. The demonstrations of the enemy in that quarter are such that he deems it imperative to hurry your artillery down at once. All that you are obliged to leave can go by water.
