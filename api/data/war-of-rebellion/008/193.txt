Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Ohio, and Missouri very proudly share the honor of victory which their gallant heroes won over the combined forces of Van Dorn, Price, and McCulloch at Pea Ridge, in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas.

I have the honor to be, captain your obedient servant,

Brigadier-General CURTIS,

Commanding in Arkansas:

I congratulate you and your command on the glorious victory just gained. You have proved yourselves as brave in battle as enduring of fatigue and hardship. A grateful country will honor you for both.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE SOUTHWEST,Pea Ridge, March 10, 1862.

CAPTAIN: The main force of the rebel Army, under Generals Van Dorn, Price, and Pike retreat by a short turn and by-road from Cross Timber Hollow toward Huntsville, camping the first night at Van Winkle's Mill, on War Eagle, south of White River. Green, with some 8,000 or 10,000, moved through Bentonville, my cavalry driving his rear guard out of that place, with the loss of one man. These two movements probably contemplate a junction in Boston Mountains.

I move two divisions a few miles forward to-day. A detachment of 100 men, under Captain Schaumberg, with a white flag, from General Van Dorn, comes to assist in collecting and burying the dead.

The enemy has lost very heavily. Among their officers are Generals McCulloch, McIntosh, and Slack, killed; also Colonel McCulloch, a nephew of the general; Captain Clark, son of Major Meriwether Clark, is killed, besides many more whose names may be furnished. I send copy of correspondence with General Van Dorn.
