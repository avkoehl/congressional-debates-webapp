patched to the War Department, at Richmond, a message containing my views of the impracticability of moving troops from this to the east bank of the Mississippi, and I shall await at this point further orders from the War Department on the subject in answer to my dispatch. I have advised Major-General Wharton to send Parsons' cavalry brigade at once to Arkansas. I beg leave respectfully to submit my opinion, that if any movement of troops in this department is in contemplation it should not be delayed on account of the proposed crossing of the infantry from this district, which I believe to be at present impossible.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. TAYLOR,

Lieutenant-General.

Major-General BUCKNER:

The letter on the other half of this sheet is inclosed in an envelope to you for your information. After reading be pleased to inclose in another envelope and forward to General Smith.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. TAYLOR,

Lieutenant-General.

HARRISONBURG, August 18, 1864.

General E. K. SMITH,

Commanding Trans-Mississippi Department:

I have the honor to inform you that I have dispatched the War Department to the effect that I consider the crossing of any considerable body of troops impossible. Accurate observations have been made of the enemy's gun-boats between Red River and Vicksburg, and from the strictness of the guard maintained no success can be anticipated. Later in the season, when the Mississippi has attained its lowest stage, troops may be crossed above Vicksburg near Paw Island, where many difficulties to navigation occur. I consider that the bare attempt to cross, almost certain to result in failure, will be very prejudicial to the troops, as many desertions will occur. Meantime not only the troops to be crossed are kept idle, but all the cavalry and artillery assisting the movement. These might certainly be of some service elsewhere in this department. I shall push forward the troops to the vicinity of the river and use every exertion and precaution to insure success, but I hoe the receipt of my dispatch will induce the War Department to countermand the order.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. TAYLOR,

Lieutenant-General.

General E. KIRBY SMITH,

Commanding Trans-Mississippi Department:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 15th instant (Numbers 3697) reached me at a late hour last night by the hands of Captain Foote, of Major-General Buckner's staff.

On the 14th instant I wrote you from Alexandria informing you that I had been directed by General Bragg, commanding the armies of the Confederate States, under the direction of the President, to cross river and assume command of the department to which I had been assigned. I inclosed a copy of the dispatch and informed you that I
