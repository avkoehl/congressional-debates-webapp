CHATTANOOGA, February 7, 1865-10 a. m.

Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

A citizen by the name of Watkins, who appears to be a truthful man, has just come from a point fifty-five miles southwest of Atlanta, and states that most of Hood's army passed Opelika on the 27th of January, going to Branchville, S. C., by way of Columbus, Ga. He says, also, that there is a large force of negroes, with a number of teams, at work repairing the railroad between Atlanta and the Etowah, and that these forces are guarded by a small body of cavalry. If the major-general commanding will give me a brigade of cavalry I will, with his approval, look into his reports about this force repairing the railroad, I need the cavalry to clear out the country.

J. B. STEEDMAN,

Major-General of Volunteers.
