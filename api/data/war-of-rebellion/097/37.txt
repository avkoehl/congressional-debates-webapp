CITY POINT, March 18, 1865.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Winchester, Va.:

General Sheridan was last night ten miles from White House, north of the Pamunkey. I had previously sent troops and supplies to White House, and last evening the road between Sheridan and that base was open to travel. He is no doubt there now and all safe.

U. S. GRAN,

Lieutenant-General.

HARPER' S FERRY, W. VA., March 17, 1865.

General MORGAN,

Chief of Staff:

The Potomac and Shenandoah are both higher than at any time before this year. They are now on a stand. It will be impossible to relay pontoon to-day; shall do so the moment the water will admit of it, I think to-morrow morning, as the Shenandoah pours out its waters with great rapidity when it once begins to fall.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

HARPERS'S FERRY, W. VA., March 18, 1865.

General MORGAN,

Chief of Staff:

Dispatch received by orderly at 7 p. m. The Shenandoah has fallen about two feet. It is falling very slowly owing to his water in Potomac. I will put down bridge, if possible, to-morrow. Colonel Reno is absent from his command at Harrisburg, Pa.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
