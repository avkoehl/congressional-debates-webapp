think, to be in my keeping. Can I get the order of the Governor to deliver in to me, through the general? The home guard about whom I wrote to the general of the date of August 10 have enrolled 100 members, under the accompanying pledge, and expect to have 100 more within a few days, when their returns come in. Can I have 150 stand of rifles or muskets sent me from the arsenal form issue to them? I will be responsible myself for their safe-keeping, and I think these people would be gratified by this mark of the general's confidence. Besides, they really need them. There are no arms worth mentioning in the hands of Union men. The fall election comes off September 5, at which time Dimmick, U. S. district attorney, and others fear an outbreak. It would be well if the San Bernandino command could be in position by then.

I am, sir, your most obedient servant,

JNO W. DAVIDSON,

Captain, First Dragoons, Commanding.

If the general will grant my suggestion about the arms, it is important they should be here before the election comes of on the 5the September.
