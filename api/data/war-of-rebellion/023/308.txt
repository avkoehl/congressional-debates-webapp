CUMBERLAND GAP, August 10, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

If I find that Kentucky is being invaded by a considerable force had I not better leave six regiments here and ago go to the rear to form a nucleus for a force to rally upon? I have now about three weeks' supply for my entire command. At present I have five companies at London and five at Richmond.

GEORGE W. MORGAN,

General.
HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, August 10, 1862.

General MORGAN,

Cumberland Gap:

Is your position defensible with you present force against the force the enemy can bring against you?

Use all possible means of ascertaining the plans and movements of the enemy in whatever direction, the points of defenses, routes of march, means of supply, &amp;c.

D. C. BUELL.

Major General H. W. HALLECK:

Orders and requisitions for supplies are sent me by Brigadier-General Boyle, who claims the command of all United States forces in Kentucky. I know of no order placing him in such command as would authorize me in ordering his requisitions to be filled. Major McLean suggests that I apply directly to you for information and instructions.
