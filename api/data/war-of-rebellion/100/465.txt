staff, also dated May 6. This report stated the manner in which Colonel Woodford officially arranged with certain loyal Georgians for the capture from the rebels of the steam-boat Governor Troup; that the vessel was accordingly captured by them, brought to the mouth of the Altamaha, and there taken possession of by a naval vessel of your command. My indorsement thereon referred the matter to you, stated that the arrangement for the capture was made under authority from these headquarters, and requested you to turn the steamer over to me. I therein further expressed my surprise that Captain Reynolds, commanding the fleet at Port Royal, should have forwarded to you a letter which was found on board addressed officially to my chief of staff. My claim for the possession of this steam-boat is based upon the facts that the arrangement for her capture was made officially by competent military authorities; that the navy had a nothing to do with her until your vessel took possession of her, when she arrived with her original captors at the mouth of the Altamaha. She has passed into your possession by a forcible seizure on the part of your subordinates. She remains in your possession by your declination to surrender your possession until a prize court has passed upon the questions involved. You, however, agree to allow me to have and use her, provided I will receipt to you for her. You use the words in this connection "providing I will indemnify you against a decision of the U. S. court that the vessel is a lawful prize. " The vessel is absolutely needed to keep up our lines of military communication on the Savannah, Altamaha, and Ocmulgee Rivers. She has been temporarily turned over to me, or rather put at my disposal, by Captain Reynolds for use on the Savannah River. Since receiving her I have been compelled to allow her to go to the Altamaha. I must, in justice to the rights of the army, respectfully protest against your detention of her either in your actual or constructive possession. But the needs of the service are too great to allow her to remain unemployed, and I am ready to receipt for her officially, so that I may have control over her and use her for military purposes until the prize court or the Government settle the questions of capture and ownership.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Rear-Admiral JOHN A. DAHLGREN, U. S. Navy,

Commanding South Atlantic Block. Squadron, Charleston Harbor, S. C.:

ADMIRAL: On April 30 I requested Captain Reynolds, commanding the fleet at this place, to loan me the use of the steam-boat Amazon, now held by the navy as a prize, for the purpose of moving supplies to Augusta. Captain Reynolds kindly placed the boat at my disposal. General Grover, commanding at Savannah, writes me that he will be unable to maintain regular communication with the post at Augusta or forward sufficient supplies thereto unless he can have the Amazon for such use. I accordingly request that you will either turn the Amazon over to me or loan her to me upon my giving the proper receipt therefor.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.
