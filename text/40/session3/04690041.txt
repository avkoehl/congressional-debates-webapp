The following estimate is furnished^ by the
commissioners of the cost of constructing and
fully equiping the road from the mouth of the
Weber canon to the head of Great Salt lake :
For grading and bridging, including masonry and
foundations complete, 96.3 miles, at $11,500 per
mile   $1,107,450
For superstructure, including rails and
fastenings, spikes, ties, track laying,_ and
ballasting, with six per cent, of sidings,
102 miles, at $17,000 per mile  1,734,000
For equipment, including motive power,
rolling stock, engine-houses, turn-tables,
shops, tools, water stations, and station
buildings, 96.3 miles, at $7,000 per mile.... 674,100
Total $3,515,550
As the actual cost of this road is a matter of
public interest I deem it proper to present, in
a condensed form, the estimates submitted, on
the 11th instant, by Jesse L. Williams, esq.
He states that the cost of the road as shown
on the books of the railroad company is, of
course, equivalent to the contract price per
mile. The actual cost to the contractors form-
ing an association, which eabraces most of the
larger stockholders of the company, is shown
only by their private boohs, to which the Gov-
ernment directors have no access. The calcu-
lations were, therefore, made from the most
accurate available data, arid the estimated cost
of the first 710 miles of the road was taken as
the basis for computing that of the whole line.
Should the Toad,- as is expected by the cour-
pany, form a junction with thafc of-the Califor>
nia company, near She northern extreme of
Great Salt, lake, a little west of Monument
Point, its length wohld be about 1,110* miles.
The cost of locating, constructing, and com-
pletely equipping it and the telegraph line
is $38,824,821, an average per mile of
$§4,977 32. .
The Government subsidy in bonds for that
distance at par amounts, to $29,504,000, an
average per mile of $26,580. The company's
first mortgage bonds are estimated at 92 per
cent., and would yield $27,143,680. The fund
realized by the company from these-tw"i sources
amounts-to $56,647,680, being ah avenge per
mile of $51,034, exceeding by $16,056,68 the
actual cost of constructing and fully equiping
the road, and yielding a profit of more than
$17,750,000;
The deficiencies in the road'noted by the
commissioners are in their opinion, almost
without exception, incident to new roads, or of
a character growing out of the peculiar diffi-
culties inseparably connected with the unex-
ampled rapidity with which it has' been con-
structed. Supplying them in the first instance
would have materially retarded the progress
of the work, and the expenditure at the pres-
ent time for the purpose will but little exceed
that originally required. It is obviously the
duty, and no doubt the desire, of the company
to bring up the constructed portion of the road
to the required standard, while at the same
time they are energetically pressing forward
the work upon the remainder of the line. An
imperative duty is devolved upon the Execu-
tive to insist upon the exact fulfillment of the
engagements of the company, and to use all
just and available means to secure it. I have
therefore the honor to recommend that the
issue of patents for land and of bonds be sus-
pended until such deficiencies shall have been
supplied.
The instructions to the commissioners re-
quired them, after they should have reported
upon the Union Pacific railroad, to examine
and report upon the roads of the Union Pacific
Railway Company, eastern division, and the
Sioux City and Pacific Railroad Company. I
have received no further report than that of
which I have endeavored to give a faithful sum-
mary.
The Central Pacific Railroad Company of
California have constructed 390 miles of their
road and telegraph line, of which 296 were
constructed and accepted since my last annual
report. This company filed a map of the defi-
nite location of their road from Humboldt
Wells via the head of Great Salt lake, to the
mouth of Weber canon. On the 15th of May
last I gave my "consent and approval" to the
location as far as the head of Great Salt lake,
a distance of 140 miles. Subsequent surveys
corrected and improved the unaccepted part
of the line, and on the 14th ultimo they filed
a map and profile from the head of Great Salt
lake to Echo Summit, to which location I gave
my " consent and approval."
The company state that their earnings for
the six months ending June 30, 1868, were
from passengers $145,048 70, and from freight
$264,410 41. Their expenses for the same
period were $157,063 89, and their indebted-
ness at that date $26,862,727, of which the
sum of $7,340,000 was on account of bonds
issued by the United States in aid of the con-
struction of the road.
On the 13th ultimo special commissioners,
Sherman Day, United States surveyor general
of California, Brevet Lieutenant Colonel R.
S. Williamson; United States Army, and Lloyd
Tevis, were appointed to examine the roads
and telegraph lines of the Central Pacific Rail-
road- Company of California and the \Vestern
Pacific Railroad Company. They were in-
structed to report in regard to the location,
road-bed, cross-ties, track laying, ballasting,
rolling stock, repair shops, station buildings,
culverts^ bridges, ^viaducts,- turnouts, and all
other appurtenances of the roads, and the
amount of expenditure required to render them,
so far as built, equal in every, respect to fully-
constructed first-class railroads.. No report
has been received.
At the date of my last annual report the
Union Pacific Railway. Company, eastern divi-
sion, had constructed 305 -miles-of their road
and telegraph line, and 285 miles thereof had
been accepted. Since that date 88;$$3& miles
have been accepted.
The amendatory act approved July 3, 1866,
authorized this company to designate a new
route and file a map thereof. They were re-
quired, however, to connect with the Union
Pacific .at a point not more than fifty miles
westerly from the meridian of Denver, in Col-
orado. Their right to bonds was limited to the
amount they would have received had the road
been constructed on the original route to the
one hundredth meridian of longitude. No
acceptable survey had been made from Fort
Riley to that meridian, and as the Department
was not officially advised of the exact distance
between those points, Brevet Major C. W.
Howell, captain of engineers, United States
Army, was at my request assigned on the 8th
of June last, by the Secretary of War, to make
such survey. He executed the duty, and sub-
mitted a report under date of September 28,
1868. He determined the distance to be
-258rf$g# miles. He also ascertained that the
meridian is 9,300 feet west of the point desig-
nated by the Union Pacific Railroad Company.
This survey was approved by you. The dis-
tance for which the company was entitled to
bonds is 393jf#§§ miles.
The following summary is made from the
report: they have constructed and operated
the road 405 miles west of the initial point. It
has been provided with round-house accom-
modations, repair shops, turn-tables, water-
tanks, sidings, &c., to meet the immediate
wants of business, and the necessary ware-
houses and depot buildings have been erected
at the stations for the accommodation of pas-
sengers and freight. The equipment is as fol-
lows : 29 locomotive engines, 21 passenger and
878 other cars. The aggregate earnings, from
September 1, 1867, to August 31, 1868, were
$1,878,588 33, and the expenses$l,247,816 38,
leaving the net earnings $630,771 95. The
average length of road operated during the year
was 331J miles, and the average earnings per
mile $5,666 93.' Surveying parties, employed
in examining the routes of the thirty-second
and thirty-fifth parallels, have discovered on
the latter a practicable route westward from
Albuquerque to the Pacific. It crosses the
Colorado river south of Fort Mohave, and
thence runs westward to the city of San Fran-
cisco, through Tehachepah Pass of the Sierra
Nevada mountains, which is only 4,020 feet
above the sea. The highest point is in the San
Francisco mountains, 7,464 feet. The entire
line is exempt from obstruction by snow, and
traverses a country rich in mineral wealth and
abounding in timber and coal. Surveys have
also been made from Fort Mohave on the Col-
orado river to San Diego, and from Fort Wal-
lace, Kansas, via Puntia Pass and San Louis
Park, to Albuquerque. The cost of surveys
in 1867 and 1868 was about $225,000.
The hostility of the Indian tribes of the plains
seriously interfered at times with the working
of the road west of Fort Harker. Stations
have been burned, rolling stock destroyed,
and a number of men killed. Trains, never-
theless, made their usual trips, but the trade
with New Mexico and Colorado was almost
entirely suspended.
