ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Washington:

Express has just reached me that about 150 of the enemy's cavalry surprised and captured Captain Means' company of Loudoun Rangers at Waterford, Va. (about fourteen miles southeast of this), this morning at daybreak. Means' company varied in strength-sometimes about sixty and other times not over thirty-without discipline. Most of my cavalry (three small companies) now out on the Winchester road. This force of the enemy can cut the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Point of Rocks or Berlin, there being but one company of infantry at either place.

I am, sir, &amp;c.,

Means' company, lately raised, without discipline, has committed all kinds of depredations on the inhabitants, living on them, taking what he pleased and when it suited him, until the arrival of his men in any vicinity was a
