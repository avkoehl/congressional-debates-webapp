however, without troops will not render necessary any change of position. They may be much harassed, if not disabled, by judicious use of long range light guns from the banks of the river, and will be delayed seriously at the obstructions. Special orders will be given for any move in this emergency. Seventh. A poiint for communication across the river has been selected, and a steam ferry with flats is being prepared to run from the mouth of Town Creek on the west to the Old State Salt Landing on the east. By this route re-enforcements can be sent to and from both detachments of the command until the fort is passed. Thus any land attack can be met. Arrangements should be made in advance and speedily for the use of this ferry, and an understanding be had as to the troops to move, &amp;c. Except in an extreme case, involving the safety of the command, the present positions will not be abandoned.

Respectfully, &c.,

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
