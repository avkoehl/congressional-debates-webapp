HEADQUARTERS ELEVENTH CORPS,Loudon, Tennessee, December 3, 1863-1.15 p. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel SAWYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: From information that I deem reliable I think the enemy is trying to retreat through New Market, Warm Springs, Asheville, &amp;c., into North Carolina. His original plan was through Murphy, into Georgia. A large train of wagons left here yesterday via Knoxville loaded. About 60 loaded wagons, 75 cars, 3 locomotives were burned after having run over the river bank. I have found four, rice, a few crackers, and corn enough certainly for three days for my command.

Longstreet ordered up ammunition, but Vaughn had already destroyed it.

Very respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S.-Can I not march direct on Maryville without going to Madisonville?

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General, Commanding.

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the following information from a man, formerly a rebel officer, who left Longstreet's army last Saturday: Two divisions (McLaws' and Jenkins'), 15,000; two brigades of Buckner's division, commanded by Bushrod Johnson, 3,500; cavalry commanded by Martin, 6,000; two brigades of cavalry under Ransom, 3,000; ditto infantry, 3,500. Longstreet has sixty pieces of artillery; horses of McLaws' division in poor condition; 1,500 the estimated loss in Sunday's battle.

Inclosed I send a rough sketch* of Longstreet's and Burnside's position.

Very respectfully,

P. S.-Your dispatch has just been received. General Davis and myself can make a bridge across Davis' Ford with wagons, if you say so.

No pontoons left here. General Davis is here. His division encamped near by. Water at Davis' Ford about 2 1/2 feet, and 6 miles from this point.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
