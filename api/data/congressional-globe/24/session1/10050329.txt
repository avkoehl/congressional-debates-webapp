24th Cong.... 1st Sess.
Land Distribution Bill—Mr. Wright.
that a still further reduction of ten per cent, is to
take place on the first day of January, in the year
1840; and that at the close of the year 1841 every
rate of duty then above twenty per cent, ad va-
lorem is to be reduced to that rate, without regard
to the amount of reduction. Mr. W. said he be-
lieved it was conceded on all hands that this last
reduction alone would diminish the revenue from
customs full five million dollars beyond the inter-
mediate and graduated reductions periodically
provided for in the bill.
Mr. W. said he was aware that he should be
answered that after the year 1841 the revenue
from the lands was, by the provisions of the bill
under discussion, to be restored to the Treasury.
This answer was specious and plausible; but was
it efficient and solid? Look at the comparison
which had been made between the revenue from
customs and the expenses of the Government, as
both were shown to exist at the present time.
The difference in favor of the revenue, if any-
thing, was too trifling to be made matter of ac-
count, while nothing was allowed for extraor-
dinary appropriations for the defenses of the
country. Allow, then, for the reduction of ten
per cent, in that revenue for the present and the
next year, and it will not meet the ordinary ex-
penses at their present rates. Carry on the cal-
culation until you reach two further similar re-
dactions, and where is the Treasury to look for
the means to answer the ordinary calls upon it? •
From whence are to be drawn the moneys to
extend and complete our Navy, to fortify our
commercial towns, to defend our extensive coast,
to garrison our Indian frontier, to arm our militia,
and to perfect our other works of national defense
projected and proposed by the Executive Depart-
ments of the Government? Could he be wrong
in saying that the means for these expenditures
would be wanting, and that these valuable and
most essential national objects could not be ac-
complished in case this bill should become a law, I
and this branch of the public revenue should be j
diverted from the legitimate uses of the public
Treasory ?
To illustrate and demonstrate more clearly
the soundness of this position, Mr. W. said he
would review, in the most condensed manner
possible, the revenue derived to the Treasury from
the public lands, for the series of years covered
by his former examinations, in reference to the
expenses of the Government, and the revenues
from customs. The statement had been derived
from the Treasury Department, and was authentic.
It was as follows:

A slight examination of th is statement will show
the fluctuations in the-sales of the public lands.
The period embraced bythe statement commences
as the country war emerging from the embarrass-
ments and derangements in its pecuniary affairs,
growing out of the then late war with Great
Britain. In 1817 the receipts into the Treasury
were a trifle short of two miHitfns*, in 1818 more
than two and a half -millions*, and in 1819 more
than three millions. From this time to the year
1829, a term of ten years, the receipts from this
source did not, in any one year, exceed, by any
considerable amount, one million and a half, and
in two of the years fell short of one million.   In
the year 1830 they rose to two and a quarter
millions; in 1831 to about three and a quarter,
and in 1832 fell back to about two and a half
millions. With the year 1833 commenced the
great increase of sales which have caused the
principal accumulation of money in the Treasury
at this moment. During that year the receipts
into the Treasury from the sales of lands were
three and seven eighths millions, in 1834 four
and four fifths millions, and in 1835 fourteen and
three fourths millions; almost ten millions beyond
the receipts óf any former year; a net increase,
in a single year, more than twice as large as the
whole receipts of the most extravagant year
which had preceded it.
Who (Mr. W. said he must ask) could expect
a continuance of sales at this rate for any length
of time ? Who were the purchasers who had paid
these immense amounts for the public domain in
a single year ? Settlers, actual settlers ? Ño, sir,
speculators: men who have purchased to sell to
settlers; men who, before the present year shall
close, will come into the market in competition
with this Government, and take from it its cus-
tomers. What lands, Mr. President, do these
men purchase? Your very best and choicest
lands. They purchase for speculation, and every
consideration-of inducement to the settler is fully
regarded in their purchases: location, advantages
of navigation, of water power, and of timber are
no less carefully secured than first qualities of
soil. The Government sells lands for cash in
advance only; and these purchasers will sell upon
credit. How long will it be, with these advant-
ages, before they will draw the emigration from
the land offices of the Government to theirs, and
take the market from us? Once taken away, it
is impoesible that we can recover it until these
lands purchased upon speculation are fully settled,
as we cannot hope to induce settlers to purchase
inferior lands, and pay the money in advance,
while superior lands are offered to them upon
credit. What, then, are we to expect from our
revenue from the public lands as soon as the
present fever for speculation in them shall sub-
side ? Can we hope that those revenues, post-
poned until the year 1841, will compensate for
the then reduced rates of the revenues from cus-
toms, and thus afford to the public Treasury the
means to meet the ordinary and extraordinary
calls upon it ? Mr. W. said it seemed to him
most clear, that if the revenues from the public
lands were diverted from the Treasury for the
period proposed by the bill, and the revenues
from customs were reduced as by the operation
of the existing laws they must be reduced, both
sources together would not, after the expiration
of the year 1841, be equal to the wants of the
public Treasury.
That our country was rapidly increasing in
population and extent, and consequently and pro-
Cortionably in its ordinary expenditures, must
e apparent to all; and that, with a fixed tariff,
the revenue from customs might be expected to
increase with the increase of expenses, would be
equally apparent; but when our rates of duty
upon imports were diminishing at a rate per
cent, greater than the increase of our population
and business, the dependence for means to sup-
ply the Treasury upon that source of revenue
must be destroyed, unless the revenues from it
could now be shown very far to exceed the pres-
ent wants of that Treasury. This had not only
not been shown; but he trusted the comparisons
he had made between the revenues from customs
and the expenses of the Government, for the last
nineteen years, and more especially for the lftBt
two years, had clearly shown the reverse, and
had proved to the satisfaction of the Senate that
the present revenues from the customs were' no
more than equal to the ordinary expenses of the
Government, without any'extraordinary appro-
priations for any purposes whatsoever. He felt
(said Mr. W.) bound to notice,in this place, that
the revenues from the lands were, in this sense,
a much more calculable dependence for the Treas-
ury than those from the customs. The receipts
and expenditures from the former—the value of
the lands being fixed by law—might be safely
assumed to be regulated! and graduated by the
increase of population and business of the coun-
:*a
try, while the rates of duty which were to grattr
udate the latter were periodically undergoing so
rapid a reduction, ana the free articles were in-
creasing so vastly upon the dutiable articles in
our importations, that very little certainty could
be anticipated in calculations of the amount of
revenue to be derived from the latter source. Ha
would give the Senate the amount of free articles
imported for the last four years, to show the im-
mense changes which the present revenue laws
had produced in our trade in reference to the rev-
enues from customs.
In the year 1832 the importation of article 
free of duty amounted to...........$14,249,453
In the year 1833.................32,447,95©
In the year 1834.................68,393,180
In the year 1835.................77,443,236
From this comparison it is seen that this de-
scription of importations has almost doubled, in
each successive year, since the passage of the
tariff act of 1832; and that during the last two
years the value of the importations free of duty
have been more than four times the value of the
same articles imported in the two preceding years,
and have come to exceed the whole value of
dutiable importations.
Take away, then, from the public Treasury,
the revenues received intoit from the public lands,
and (Mr. W. asked) who could tell how soon it
would want means, to meet the demando upon it?
He called upon gentlemen, and especially upon
the parties to the compromise act, to give their
careful attention to this part of the argument. If
revenue should be wanted, did those gentlemen
doubt what course would be taken by Congress
to raise it? Did they doubt that resort would be
instantly made to an increase of the rates of duty
upon imports? Was any ope wild enough to
suppose that a direct tax would be resorted to tp
supply the-deficiency in the revenues, or that
loans would be made upon the credit of the Gov-
ernment, and a new national debt be created for
this purpose? He was sure no one who heard
him could anticipate either of the last-mentioned
modes of supplying the Treasury; and an increase
of the indirect taxation, by an increase of the
customs, was the only remaining measure within
the power of Congress. He must further caution
gentlemen to remember that this was a mode of
raising revenue not likely to be unpopular with
a very large section, if not an entire majority, of
the Union. He made this reference to peculiar
local interests, not with pleasure, but with deep
reluctance, and he could not be induced to do it
from any other than a most lively conviction that
the measure before the Senate was eminently cal-
culated again, and that speedily, to revive agita-
tions which had so recently shaken the country
to an extent unknown to its former history, and
had more strongly threatened the integrity and
perpetuity of the Union than any other questions
which had ever before occupied the attention of
Congress. He must, therefore, again assure the
friends of this bill that its passage, and the sub-
traction of this portion of the public revenues
from the national Treasury, would bring that
Treasury to want; and that, in that event, its
wants would be supplied by an increase of the
duties upon imports, an increased tariff.
To give greater force to this part of the argu-
ment he would take another view of the probable
revenue from customs in the year 1842, after the
reductions provided for in the compromise act
shall have been fully made. The importations of
good  paying duties for the last four years have
been as follows:
In the year 1832 the value of dutiable goods im-
, ported was........,,........• • • 4^ 9°0-$9Ji
In the year 1833...................^MS
In the year 1834.,.................¿I'°°°.°2£
In the year 1835...................66,000,000
These importations form an average of about
sixty-one millions per annum. Suppose the in-
crease of population and business by the year
1842 increases the amount of importations to
seventy millions of goods paying duties, all duties
are then to be reduced to the standard of twenty
per cent, ad valorem, or under. This rate of duty
upon seventy millions would be fourteen millions
of revenue, in ease all duties were at the maxi-
