It has been in operation about five months, and turns out a large quantity of powder. It is now the only one, besides the one in Augusta, Ga. There are no fortifications in or around Montgomery. All the mortars in the possession of the rebels at Mobile have been organized into a siege train, mounted two on wagon, drawn by mules. They are fifteen in number, and 10-inch caliber. They can be moved readily, so that their fire can be readily concentrated on any particular point.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. M. JACKSON,

Major, Tenth U. S. Colored Heavy Artillery.
