STEVENSON, October 9, 1863-3 p.m.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD,

Murfreesborough:

Dispatch received. You deserve for your promptitude, energy, and management a much higher reward than I can give you. General Morgan has been ordered to withdraw his force from the defense of the road. He has four companies at La Vergne. If this change should leave that point unguarded, direct General Ward to send the necessary force to protect it, and have General Slocum retain a larger force of the Twelfth Corps at Murfreesborough. The former must be relieved at once. See the order telegraphed to General Slocum, and have it sent to him.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.

Dispatch just received announcing Roddey's movement. Decherd and Cowan were left weak. The One hundred and second Ohio and Edgarton's battery were to have left Tullahoma at 8 this a.m.-infantry for Cowan and the battery for Stevenson. I cannot tell whether these troops will reach there in time. General Slocum is here. I had turned over command to him previous to receipt of dispatches. Will turn copies over to him for his orders.
