HEADQUARTERS, Louisville, January 31, 1862.

General THOMAS:

The two regiments belong to General Carter's command and must go with it. Inform General Carter that Humphrey Marshall proposes to winter at Whitesburg; tell him his depot at London must be fortified and the command vigilant. Has any force gone to Monticello? What word from the South Fork road, and what do you learn in regard to supplies on the route?

D. C. BUELL,Brigadier-General, Commanding.

SOMERSET, KY., January 31, 1862.

General D. C. BUELL:

I intended to start General Schoepf's brigade yesterday to Monticello, but the roads are in such a condition that supplies did not reach here in time. He will cross the river to-day start to-morrow, or as soon as the weather will permit. It still continues to rain, keeping the roads as bad as ever.

The man I sent to examine the South Fork road has not yet returned. I shall need an extra regiment to guard this depot when we leave.

GEO. THOMAS,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS, Louisville, January 31, 1862.

General THOMAS:

Stop the movement of General Schoepf's brigade until further orders.

Saint Louis, February 1, 1862.

Brigadier General D. C. BUELL, Louisville, Ky.:

Co-operation at present not essential. Henry has been re-enforced, but where from I have not learned. The roads are in such horrible condition as to render movements almost impossible on land. Will write you fully my plans as soon as I get your letter of the 30th ultimo. Write me your plans, and I will try to assist you.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
