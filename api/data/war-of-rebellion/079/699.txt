Although repeatedly called for, I have not succeeded in obtaining a return of troops from the District of WEST Tennessee, and cannot say what the exact force at Memphis is, but know that the infantry and artillery are but sufficient for garrison, and the small amount of cavalry remaining there of but little account for offensive operations. As state in my telegram of this date, Magruder is marching in force on Steele at Little Rock, and a considerable body of the enemy are attempting a passage to the east side of the MISSISSIPPI in vicinity of Gaines' Landing, where I have 1,000 cavalry and some artillery. Major-General Reynolds is commanding the forces to oppose the passage. Major-General Canby promises me an expedition into lower MISSISSIPPI of 3,000 cavalry from Baton Rouge as a diversion, and directs me to remain at Vicksburg until further orders. I have ordered General Washburn, at Memphis, to fill up his subsistence and ordnance depots by immediate estimates, and put his command and works into the best possible conditions for defense.

(Received 8th.)

COMMANDING OFFICER DISTRICT OF WEST TENNESSEE,

Memphis:

I have ordered Rosecrans to send to Memphis the detachments of the SIXTEENTH and Seventeenth Corps and the cavalry DIVISION the moment they can be spared from Missouri, and by the quickest route. If the cavalry DIVISION is far advanced in the pursuit of Price it will probably come by the way of Fort Smith and Little Rock.

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Kingston, Ga., November 8, 1864.

General EASTON and

Colonel BECKWITH,

Atlanta, Ga.:

The general wishes me to confide to you the fact that so long as Hood was moving rapidly toward Tennessee he was in a hurry about getting back material in order to move as soon as possible; but now that Hood has brought up on the Tennessee he is willing to give you time to clear all up well. *

Aide-de-Camp.

ATLANTA, November 8, 1864-12 m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

We are in possession of your cipher dispatch of this morning in relation to the position of Hood. We beg that no destruction of the railroad be commenced until we notify you that the rolling-stock is safe and everything ready.
