THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 25,
for constitutional conventions in 1869 were
474.753; and in Florida 28,003, thus making
6,218,838 voters in the United States. So
94,323 persons out of 0,250,000 voters pay the
income tax, making, according to my calcu-
lation, just one voter out of sixty-five, and
that under a Government which professes to
give equality of rights and to impose equality
of burdens.
But, look at it: 91,323 persons out of
38,500,000 who have an income exceeding
$2,000! Is not the absurdity of the adminis-
tration of this income tax law apparent upon
the very statement? Does any man believe
that if be were to take up the assessments of
real and personal estate in the cities of New
York and Philadelphia, look at the aggregate,
and find what it is, he would find that there are
not 94,000 people in those two cities alone who
have an income exceeding $2,000 per annum?
And yet this is all that is gotten out of it over
the whole United States—94,323 persons, and
of these 40,000 pay from fitly to one hundred
dollars ; 44,000 from one hundred to five hun-
dred dollars, and 9,000 over five hundred dol-
lars. You tax the few who can pay; is that the
principle: because they are rich andean stand
it? If that is the principle, why not do it cour-
ageously; why not march right np and assert
this principle in such form as to make it worth
something, and not continue to administer an
emasculated law which irritates the people and
is no benefit to the Treasury in the amount
that it puts into it?
Why not take these ninety-two hundred and
forty-three people who pay ail income of
over five hundred dollars a year; they are
rich, they can stand it. Five hundred dol-
lars tax a year represents an income of $10,-
000; so that in order to pay a tax of $000 a
year, under the old law, a man must have an
income of at least $11,000, or fixed capital
amounting to about two hundred thousand
dollars. Here, then, are men who have an
income of $11,000. Now, if the principle be
defensible that you are to tax the rich man
who can bear it, instead of deducting two and
a half per cent, off everybody, why not step
right up to these rich men and take twenty-five
per cent, at once? Out of the nine thousand
at twenty-five per cent., you will get more in-
come tax than you will get out of the whole
United Suites now at two and a half per cent.
tvyice over. Twenty-five per cent, on these
nine thousand will give you about twenty-three
millions, whereas two and a half per ce'tit., as
it is now to be administered, will not give you
more than nine or ten million dollars. ' If
the principle be defensible it might as well be
applied in that way as in the way in which it
is under the present law; and yet who would
undertake to do that? It might be popular;
it might be captivating in some quarters to say
" We will select the rich men and make them
pay all the tax;" but I tell you, Mr. Presi-
dent, the security of that Government which
does not treat rich and poor alike, both in its
rights and its exactions, is fast disappearing, j
They must be treated alike; and the poor man j
ought to be the first who would most sternly
resist any attempt at discrimination.
_ Now 1 come to another feature of this tax. I
The communication which I have presented i
discloses the fact that there are twenty-three
congressional districts in the United States
which under the present law will not yield an
income tax of Hi,000 per annum—one tenth
very nearly of all the congressional districts in
the United States. Twenty-three Representa-
tives in the other House, under this law, have
constituents who pay not one dollar of this tax.
Is that reconcilable with the true theory of
republican government, where the quota of
constituencies could be and should be appor-
tioned iu accordance with their ability to pay
either upon revenues or upon consumption?
And yet, sir, we are asked now to continue
the employment of collectors and assessors and
assistant assessors in these twenty-three dis-
tricts, for the purpose of collecting a tax which
will not pay one third their salaries. I suppose
there is not a collection district in the United
States the expenses of administering which are
less than $3,000; and yet you have here twenty-
three districts, not one of which will realize
$1,000 out of this income tax; and the state-
ment is that the present state of business will
in all probability increase that number instead
of diminishing it.
Thus much, Mr. President, in reference to
the injustice of this tax, in addition to what I
had the honor of submitting before. Now,
why continue it, if it is unjust, if it is unequal,
and if it is unconstitutional, as there are very
good grounds for arguing it is? And before I
pass to the second head, I wish to state as a
fact with reference to that question, that as
loyal a people as there existed during our
rebellion, those who contributed most and
most freely for the purpose of sustaining the
Government and the armies in tha.field, who
contributed their taxes and contributed volun-
tarily—those people have, after the Govern-
ment broke its promise that this tax should
continue no longer than 1870, after the exi-
gency had passed, when they said the Gov-
ernment no longer needed this tax, determ-
ined to test the constitutionality of the meas-
ure. I have upon my table, and I have no
doubt other Senators have irad it upon their
tables, the opinion, after a careful examina-
tion of this question, of the former Attorney
General of the United States, Mr. Evarts, that
there can be very little doubt about the uncon-
stitutionality of this tax. "
Is it not better, when we see that the conse-
quence of administering this tax will be con-
tinued expense, continued irritation, and very
little profit to the Treasury, at once, and before
it goes again into operation, in violation of our
promise, to redeem that promise and repeal
the tax, rather than take this law into out-
judicial tribunals for the purpose of testing
its constitutionality?
Is it needed? When we had this subject
before us at the last session we were told the
Government could not do without the income
tax. 1 come now briefly to that subject; and
it is a subject, of course, upon which figures
of rhetoric are out of place. The figures of
arithmetic are only to be dealt with in hand-
ling a question of this character.
i start, Mr. President, with the amount in
the Treasury according to the report of the
1st of January, 1871. The report given us
then shows that there were in the Treasury
$138,080,572. The Secretary of the Treasury
in his annual report for 1870, on page 5, shows
us that there will be a surplus of $10,778,680;
but in the estimate which results in that surplus
of $10,778,680, there are embraced two items
which are really a payment of the national
debt: the sinking fund, $24,500,000, and the
interest on capital invested m sinking fund,
$4,880,319. Now, take 1mssurplus,according
to his estimate of $10,778,680, with the sink-
ing fund and the interest of the sinking fund,
we should, according to his estimate, pay i
$40,104,910 of the national debt during this i
year. But he follows that by saying:
"An analysis of the expenditures develops facts
tending to sustain Lite opinion that the balanco will
be considerably larger than appears from the fore-
going estimates.
" The sum ot j22,338,27837 is the estimate for public
works. The appropriations for these objects for the
present year are less than twelve million dollars,
and it is reasonable to presume that the appropria-
tions for the next year will not much exceed that
amount."
Thus we have the statement that an analysis
develops facts tending to sustain the opinion
that the balance will be considerably larger;
and by way of illustrating that he gives us one
of these items, and iu that one alone there is a
difference of $10,000,000. I do not know how
much there may be in the others, for the an-
alysis we have not given to us. But if von add
that $10,000,000 to the $40,000,000," which,
according to his own estimate will be paid, wo
have $50,000,000 of the national debt paid
off this year, upon his estimate; and that is
enough to pay in one year. If we can go on
paying $50,000,000 of the debt in each year,
and diminishing the taxes, we shall be doing
well; and more than that ought not to be asked,
if so much. We have borne burdens enough.
Those who come after us ought not to grudge
at discounting the legacy which we give them.
But to follow his estimate for 1871-72, as to
the increase in the customs and the internal
revenue, let me look at it one moment. For
the year ending June 30, 1870, the internal
revenue receipts were $185,128,859; but ac-
cording to the table which was sent in to us at
the time we had this subject under considera-
tion, we were to reducethat $43,597,774. That
would leave $141,031,085. But we reduced
it more than $43,000,000; we reduced it
$57,000,000. So that $14,000,000 would come
from that, reducing it to about $127,000,000.
But why reduce this estimate to $126,418,000
when the only change is in the income tax, and
that is only about eight million dollars more
than was estimated by the reduction sent into
us at that time? I call attention now to the
gradual increase which is shown by these tables
upon our revenue to show that these estimates
are based upon the former receipts without
adding the average increase which the tables
show has been constantly going on.
Taking up the report of the Internal Rev-
enue Commissioner for the last year, 1 find that
the average increase upon the internal revenue
tax is 15j70- per cent. But take the three items
which are left, and from which, principally,
our revenues are now to be derived, and we
find that the increase is, on spirits, 23 percent.,
on tobacco, 34 per cent., and on fermented
liquors, 4 per cent. Will there be any falling
off in these items? I read again from the
Commissioner's report. On page 7 Iiq, tells us:
"Judging from the information in the possession of
this etiiee, there is no reason tor believing that, there
wUl bc any material failing off in the production of
spirits during the current fiscal year."
Mr. SHERMAN. That was written in ®c-
tober. I can inform the Senator now that
there has been a falling off of nearly one third
since that time, as I am prepared to show.
Mr. SCOTT. Of production?
Mr. SHERMAN. Of the production of
spirits.
Mr. SCOTT. It will be gratifying news to
the country that there is not any more whisky
than that consumed, for I notice that in the
current year, when this report was made, there
were only 11,000,000 gallons in bond against
15,000,000 the year before; and I think the
less whisky we consume the more taxes we
| can pay. I have very little doubt if we get
down the consumption of whisky to nothing
we can get out of the people who fill jails and
penitentiaries more revenue; and in either wav
there will be no diminution of the revenue of
the country if you will only stop the large
manufacture of whisky.
I proceed, however, with these estimates.
Those from customs were based npon the ex-
isting laws, and in the report (page 21) they
aie put down at $185,000,000. The report
of 1870 (page 4) shows the first quaiter's cus-
toms receipts to have been $57,729,473, and
the estimate for the balance of the year is
$128,000,000, making $185,729,473; and
yet by the act of July 11, 1870, we took off
$23,000,000 of the revenue from customs,
and the receipts for 1871-72 are estimated
now at $175,000,000, showing that there will
he no diminution there, but that the receipts
from customs are increasing.
Now, take the estimated receipts of internal
revenue for 1870-71, on page 21 of the report,
'i he estimate of the internal revenue was based
on then existing laws at $175,000,000. The
report of 1870 shows that for the first, quar-
ter of 1870 $49,147,137 were received. The
three remaining quarters were estimated at
$98,000,000, making $147,147,137; and yet we
