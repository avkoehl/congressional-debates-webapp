General Milroy from Chattanooga. He thinks Forrest may come on. Colonel Lyon telegraphs from Huntsville that a scout from thirteenth Indiana Cavalry was at Fayetteville at 7 a. m. to-day and that no enemy had been there up to that time.

NASHVILLE, TENN., September 27, 1864.

Major-General MILROY,

Tullahoma:

The enemy are in force at Pulaski, and driving our cavalry. Our infantry re-enforcements have reached there, and are advancing. The ammunition for Fifth Tennessee goes down on train which takes the One hundred and seventy-fourth Ohio to Murfreesborough. Better have it run down from Murfreesborough in car with you.

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

NASHVILLE, September 27, 1864-2. 50 p. m.

Major-General MILROY:

Forrest is at Pulaski, in General Rousseau's front and fighting him. Say this to General Van Cleve. What forces have reported to you from below, and how have they been posted?

B. H. POLK,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NASHVILLE, September 27, 1864-6. 30 p. m.

(Received 7. 15 p. m.)

Major-General MILROY:

Nothing heard from General Rousseau since 2 p. m. He was then being driven slowly by the enemy. A scout from Wartrace reports rebel spies going eastward to get Williams. The fact that General rousseau has to fall back is an indication that Forrest's force is very strong. If Forrest strikes the railroad this side of you, it would be best to move up and attack him, as General Rousseau will follow him up.

B. H. POLK,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NASHVILLE, September 27, 1864-11 p. m.

Major-General MILROY,

Tullahoma:

Telegraph from General Rousseau, at Pulaski, 6. 15 p. m., says he has been skirmishing with enemy all day, and that the contending parties confront each other, the enemy having heavy skirmish line close up to ours. The general holds Pulaski, and thinks the enemy will attack in the morning. He estimates the force at 7,000 and eighteen pieces of artillery. Part of Wheeler's command is with Forrest.

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
