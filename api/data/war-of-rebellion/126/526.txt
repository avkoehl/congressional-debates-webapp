The reconstruction of these roads and their successful operation are of great importance, not only to the districts in which they are located, but to the general commerce and prosperity of the country; and the liberal policy pursued toward them will react favorably upon the revenue and credit of the Nation.

The agreement made early in the war with the railroad companies of the loyal States, fixing reduced rates of military transportation, remains in force, and has been extended to the railroads in the Southern States since the termination of hostilities.

Full reports are given of the quantities of clothing, camp and garrison equipage furnished to our armies during the past year, and also during the war. The tables accompanying the Quartermaster-General's report give information on these points, which shows in a favorable light the manufacturing power of the country.

The vast supplies of forage required for the armies have been promptly furnished and transported to the depots. While moving through the Southern country the armies found ample quantities, and it was only when lying still in camp that they had any difficulty in supplying themselves.

During the year over 29,000,000 bushels of grain and 400,000 tons of hay have been provided by the depots of the Quartermaster's Department; 366,000 cords of wood and 832,000 tons of coal have also been supplied by the depots. Troops in the field have operated. The depots of the Quartermaster's Department have, during the war, furnished the Army with 23,000,000 bushels of corn, 78,000,000 bushels of oats, 93,000 bushels of barley, 1,500,000 tons of hay, 20,000 tons of straw, 550,000 cords of wood, and 1,600,000 tons of coal, all of which have been purchased, measured, transported, issued, and accounted for by its officers and agents. At the depot of Washington alone there have been issued during the year 4,500,000 bushels of corn, 29,000,000 bushels of oats, 490,000 tons of hay, 210,000 cords of wood, and 392,000 tons of coal.

The supply of horses and mules for the Army has been regular and sufficient. There were purchased during the fiscal year 141,632 cavalry horses; from September 1, 1864, to 30th of June, 1865, 20,714 artillery horses; and from 1st of July, 1864, to 30th of June, 1865, 58,818 mules. Prices of horses varied during the year from $144 to $185; of mules, from $170 to $195.

The reduction of the Army has enabled the Quartermaster's Department to dispense with large numbers of horses and mules, and to the 17th of October the sales of animals are estimated to have produced $7,000,000.

The teams and animals of the armies have, as during previous fiscal years, averaged about one wagon to twenty-four men in the field, and one horse or mule to every two men.

The burial records of the Quartermaster's Department, which do not include the names of those who fell in battle and where buried immediately on the field by their comrades, show the interment in cemeteries of 116,148 persons, of whom 98,827 were loyal, 12,596 disloyal, and of whom 95,803 were whites and 20,345 colored persons.

The military cemeteries at Washington, Alexandria, Arlington, and Chattanooga have been carefully tended and decorated.

An officer, with material and men to mark the graves of our brethren who feel victims to rebel barbarity at Andersonville, was dispatched from Washington as soon as the country was opened to us, and reports
