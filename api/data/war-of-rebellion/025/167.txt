HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,August 13, 1862.

Brigadier-General GRANGER, Rienzi:

Make adequate provision for cavalry to scout and watch the front of the Third Division at Jacinto-a battalion under a good commander., The company with Brigadier-General Davis, and the two accompanying Mitchell may be disposed of to the best advantage. But the rebel cavalry having returned this way, Mizner might come nearer Iuka, but upon the table lands. Davis' command should have cavalry at Iuka. They need there two companies more than they have, with those sent with Mitchell.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.

Have you prepared to support the cavalry if pursued to-morrow?
