hour, as directed, but no orders were received until 8 o'clock, when the following communication was brought me by courier from General Longstreet's assistant adjutant-general, Lieutenant-Colonel Sorrel:
HEADQUARTERS, November 16, 1863.

General McLAWS,Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The enemy appears in full retreat, leaving in confusion and abandoning many of their wagons. The commanding general desires you to push on at once by the Campbell's Station road, communicating with us from time to time. Colonel J. R. Hart has some cavalry on the Knoxville road opposite Lenoir's, which you can use as you wish. You should move as quickly as possible.

Respectfully,

G. MOXLEY SORREL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S.-You are to move on to Campbell's Station. I will send you a good guide as soon as I can find one.

Very respectfully,

G. MOXLEY SORREL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S.-The enemy have left in haste, leaving behind 80 wagons, and colors and a good deal of plunder.

And afterward the following:
HEADQUARTERS, November 16, 1863.

Major-General McLAWS,Commanding Division:

GENERAL: General Longstreet wishes you to push on on the road on which you are until you intersect the road on which we are, about 16 miles short of Knoxville.

Respectfully,

OSMAN LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

As Campbell's Station is 15 miles from Knoxville, the intersection spoken of was, I suppose, 1 mile from the former and on the Loudon side between me and Campbell's Station. Arriving in the vicinity of Campbell's Station, I was informed that General Longstreet was but 100 or 200 yards to my right, and reporting to him, was ordered and deployed my line to the front, but not to show it beyond the
