I am sending regiments forward to Helena; one leaves here this evening. As far as possible I hope you will support the transports where danger of batteries on shore may be threatened. I think you for prompt response to my former request.

Send word to the refugee Indians that I am anxious to relieve them. As strong will start to-morrow from Keetsville to drive rebel Indians from old homes. General Blunt leads. Their braves should be with him.

Brigadier General BEN. LOAN, Lexington, Mo.:

GENERAL: I trust you may be able to create some terror in the rebel camps near Lexington. Their complaints are always evidence of the activity of my forces, and though I always hear, I am not ready to condemn my friends. Decisive and active measures are scattering and scaring the bands out of the State. The river counties are the worst. The wealthy secesh rebels must be made to suffer. They support the poor scamps that hide in the brush. In some way they must be disqualified to do mischief. I have never had time to answer a long letter containing many inquiries, but I sent you a circular that answers some of them.

I am, general, very respectfully, yours,

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
