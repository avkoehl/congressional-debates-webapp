great force. Will you, therefore, order Kautz to send a regiment of cavalry or more to aid the gun-boat force at Powhatan in driving these fellows away.

Respectfully,

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

Shall I direct Gregg to send, say, 500 cavalry to do this? Swan Point is twenty miles below Powhatan.

Major General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General:

I will ship the transportation of the Sixth Corps and Cavalry Corps forward as rapidly as possible. I saw the necessity for it some days ago. General Grant thinks it will not be necessary to ship all of it, and he directs me to hold the transports here that may arrive hereafter. I have ordered Continental to Fort Monroe. She draws too much water for this place and Washington. Please cause your orders to be given to her through Colonel Biggs. One hundred and sixty-eight wagons of the Sixth and 179 of the Cavalry have been shipped. We are shipping to-day as fast as means permit.

General S. WILLIAMS:

GENERAL: There were 33 men killed and 75 wounded yesterday by the explosion of ordnance on the barge. The store-house and wharf were greatly damaged, but can be repaired in a short time. There was but slight loss of subsistence and quartermaster's property. I have heard of no report of the ordnance department as to cause of explosion or loss of property.
