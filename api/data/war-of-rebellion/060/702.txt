glad to examine, as they shed more or less light upon affairs in rebel-dom. Probably there is a force of about 6,000 or 7,000 at Kinston. The force at Wilmington is, in round numbers, 6,000. There are troops at Weldon and Greenville. Colonel McChesney was here a few days since, and he thinks there are some 3,000 or 4,000 at Greenville, with nine companies of cavalry 8 miles from Washington.

The Sixth North Carolina Cavalry has arrived from Longstreet's army near Bristol, and has about 600 men. General Corse, with his brigade, also came from Longstreet and was at Goldsborough, but I cannot learn where he is now; possibly at Greenville.

I cut the following out not knowing whether it is correct or not:

LONGSTREET'S MOVEMENTS.

LOUISVILLE, March 12, 1864.

The Democrat has information from an officer who left Knoxville on the 6th instant that General Longstreet had sent his wagon train to Richmond, and was mounting his entire force, and that the general impression a Knoxville was that Longstreet had been ordered to North Carolina.

Colonel Starr is chief of artillery at Kinston, and has thirty-six field guns. Some of his batteries are at Greenville and Kenansville.

Yesterday I had the honor to address you in relation to the iron went from Wilmington and Atlanta for the rams.

I am very respectfully, your obedient servant,
