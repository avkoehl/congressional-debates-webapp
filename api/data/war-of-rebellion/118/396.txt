notice on the rolls from Sandusky a number returned as belonging to Kentucky regiments. Nothing was sent with them when arrested to show that they belonged to any military organization and the entry is made on their own statement. On the rolls from the Old Capitol are five officers who have heretofore been exchanged. Herewith you will find inclosed two rolls of deliveries of rebel prisoners at Baton Rouge. I inclose also a list of rebel prisoners paroled at Des Arc, Ark. I will hand to Captain Mulford rolls of rebel officers that we now hold at the various camps and military prisoners. There may be some inaccuracies in the lists as some of them are probably already exchanged, but the records as we have them show the lists* as presented.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

Washington, D. C., March 26, 1863.

Major T. HENDRICKSON, Commanding Alton Prison, Alton, Ill.

MAJOR: Your letter of the 19th is received and I have the satisfaction of informing you that orders have been issued placing you in full control of the prison, for which a suitable guard will be detailed to be under your command. You will probably find ample instructions on file in the commanding officer's office to guide you in all matters connected with the prison. I have given particular instructions in relation to the authority of Colonel Dick over prisoners sent there by him and I think will be no difficulty on that point. If my letters have been lost or destroyed, which is not improbable, please inform me and I will send you copies.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I have additional information to-day of the sufferings of our officers growing out of scarcity of provisions at the South.

L. THOMAS, Adjutant-General U. S. Army.

SIR: The paroled prisoners at Annapolis, Md., are ordered by the commandant of the post to work upon the barracks now being erected by the Government at that place. A refusal subjects them to confinement in the guard-house and subsistence upon bread and water. The ground of their objection is that they on being paroled took an oath not to render the United States Government any service directly or indirectly
