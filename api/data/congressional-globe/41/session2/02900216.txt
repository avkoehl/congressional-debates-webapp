It will be seen that no tariff heretofore called
"protective" has been levied at as high a rate
of duty as under our present laws. Indeed,
the act of 1S2S, under which nullification was
threatened, averaged 39.3 per cent, on duti-
able articles, or 33.8 per cent, on the aggregate
of importations. It will be also seen that we
have had only 8 years of protective tariff, for
71 years up to 1860, except double duties dur-
ing the war of 1812; and it is a curious fact
that no political party has held control of the
Government more than one term of four years
that has adopted a, protective policy as distin-
guished from a revenue policy. The present
tariff and^ those levied during the war have
been sustained under the argument of neces-
sity ; but the necessity of keeping on so high
a rate of duties no longer exisK The people
demand such adjustment as will relieve them
of a portion of the burden.
Under the tariff of 1846 the duty upon salt
was merely nominal; I believe 15 per cent, ad
valorem. Under that tariff the great amount
of salt that was consumed in the country was
obtained in the State of New York, in the
State of Ohio, in the State of West Virginia,
and more recently in the State of Michigan ;
and in addition to the amount which could be
procured from the salt-works of those States
large importations were brought into the coun-
try. And I believe that the facts show that the
salt interest in no one of those yarious States
suffered in consequence of the amount of im-
portations and the lowness of the duty levied
upon salt. But on a readjustment of the duties
under the new tariff law a higher rate of duty
was imposed : on salt in bulk 18 cents per 100
pounds, and in bags 24 cents per 100 pounds.
Now, what has been the result of these higher
'■ duties ? Why, the farmer of the western prairie
and the farmer of the great Mississippi valley
are compelled to pay that duty in addition to
the price of the salt which they purchase. Iu
proof of this statement I refer to the prices
current all over the country. I refer to the
faet that in 1860 the price of salt was from 18
to 20 cents a bushel, and that the same salt is
now quoted at 48 cents a bushel. This is the
difference in price which the people of the
country are compelled to pay for an article
which enters into the home consumption and
into the domestic life of the inhabitants of the
whole country. It is used in every household,
and this duty becomes an element in fixing the
price of tho pork and beef packed all over the
country, which enters into the consumption of
the people everywhere, and thus increases tho
price of food.
Now, if these are facts, if it be true that the
price has been increased in consequence of the
higher duty, I ask why is it levied ? It is said
that the salt interests of New York and of Mich-
igan need protection ; that the salt interest of
West Virginia needs protection. This plea, of
course, implies that the duty must increase the
price of salt, and that the farmer, or whoever
else purchases a bag of salt, is compelled to
pay an increased price in consequence of the
duty.
By the returns made to the Statistical Bureau
it appears that only about $1,000,000 has been
received as the revenue derived from the duty
on imported salt. This shows that the manu-
facturers of the country cannot supply the de-
mand, and that the effect of the duty is simply
to increase the price which the consumers of the
country have to pay. On all importations of
salt the duty paid is larger than the cost of
carriage. Now, we may ask where this in-
creased price goes. We consume tho salt which
is produced in New York, Michigan, Ohio,
and West Virginia, together with that which is
imported, amounting to 527,421,176 pound?,
on which the duty collected was $1,040,225 07.
Where does ihe money go to upon that con-
sumed i« this country ? By reason of this high
tariff the price upon the home-produced salt,
is increased. Does it benefit the people in any
way? Does it benefit the Government? No.
We get into the Treasury about $1,000,000,
and we pay into the treasuries of the salt man-
ufacturers many millions more; how many I do
not know ; probably 84,000,000 to $5,000,001.1.
Is this necessary ? 1 know that the gentleman
from New York [Mr. McCarthy] has put in u,
plea here for the salt-manufacturing interest
of that State. I listened to the gentleman's
argument; but I still ask, is it necessary that
this salt interest should have this protection?
Would the reduction of the duty stop the man-
ufacture of a single pound of salt?
Why, sir, this Onondaga company, about
which there is so much said, organized by a
consolidation of the various salt companies in
the State of New York about the year 18li;),
with a paid-up cash capital of $160,000, man
ufactures nearly 7,000,000 bushels of gait pot-
year; and, sir, that company paid dividends in
the 8 years from I860 to 1868 amounting to
$2,000,000, and had besides $600,000 on lxind
as a surplus fund. This is au annual dividend
of $250,000 per year, and with tho surplus
double the actual capital invested. The peo-
ple of the country are ready to pay a fair price
for the salt they consume; but will they endure
being compelled to pay high prices in order to
swell the dividends of particular manufacturing
companies ? i ask, is it in the interest of labor,
is it just, is it right that we should continue
to do this? Everyman who buys an ounce of
salt with which to season, as a condiment, the
food upon his table away off in the prairie,
every farmer through the country, every poor
laborer, every man throughout the community
pays this tax, not into the national Treasury,
but kito the treasury of the Onondaga coin-
