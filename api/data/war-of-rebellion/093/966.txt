HORACE CAPRON,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

Brigadier General R. S. GRANGER,

Decatur, Ala.:

Be prepared to have the road at the ford of Elk River obstructed and to carry out my instructions given you some days since for your guidance in case of an advance of the enemy. Send out scouts on the Athens and Florence roads, and keep yourself well informed of the enemy's movements.
