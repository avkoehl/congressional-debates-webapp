WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A.,

Richmond, May 13, 1863.

General D. H. HILL, Goldsborough, N. C.:

Necessity compels me to reduce the force at Charleston very low. General Whiting, on inquiry, informs me that on a pinch he can send to the aid of Charleston in case of attack three regiments. I inform you of this, and in addition suggest if, as I believe, the enemy have nearly withdrawn, let your arrangements be made to allow in case of necessity the transfer of a larger force.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
