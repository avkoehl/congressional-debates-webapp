HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Near Atlanta, Ga., August 14, 1864.

I have the honor to report nothing unusual in my front to-day. The usual amount of picket-firing was kept up, with some artillery, doing but little damage, as shown by the list of casualties. On last night I straightened and intrenched the skirmish line on my right, upon the ground gained by the advance of yesterday, which, to a certain extent, relieved that portion of my line from exposure to the enemy's sharpshooters.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. J. LIGHTBURN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that nothing unusual occurred in my front to-day. The enemy seems to have had a new set of men on the skirmish line to-day, who were inclined to fire more than yesterday, and were less careful about exposing themselves.

J. A. J. LIGHTBURN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

For that period I have caused the adjutant-general of the division, who has been on duty with it all of that time, to make a report of the operations of the division, which, upon comparison with the reports of brigades and regiments, I find to be substantially correct.

I found the division, August 17, in the trenches in front of Atlanta, composed of two brigades, the First, commanded by Colonel Theodore Jones, Thirtieth Ohio Volunteers, with 997 effective aggregate for duty; the Second, commanded by Colonel Wells S. Jones, Fifty-third Ohio Volunteers, with 1,173 effective aggregate for duty, with two batteries of light artillery, Company H, First Illinois Light Artillery, with three 20-pounder Parrotts, commanded by Captain F. De Gress, and Company A, of the same regiment, with four 12-pounder light field guns, effective aggregate of both for duty being 141, making the entire effective strength of the division 2,291. The
