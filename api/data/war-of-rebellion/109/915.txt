WAR DEPARTMENT, May 10, 1864.

General BRAGG:

On inquiry I find Dublin Depot to be in Pulaski County at a point ont e railroad designated as "Thorn's Sprin." The New River bridge is on this, the eastern side. Consequently McCausland's shattered force is between the enemy and Lynchburg; but, unless Jones interposes, there is only a very small guard between the enemy and the salt-works and lead mines.

Resepctfully,

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
