Captain McENTEE,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

We have news from Orange Court-House from our own men up to Wednesday morning last. No troops had passed there from General Lee's army since the division of Longstreet's corps, which passed two weeks ago to-day, except Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry. Both the old men agree that to infantry has passed either way for the past two weeks. Deserters sent in from General Hancock left their lines after sunrise this morning. Late last night Field's division and the two brigades of Anderson's division were still on General Hancock's front. What else they did not know, if any, except that there was still right smart of cavalry on north side. The line of Pickett's division between the two rivers remains unchanged.

SHARPE,

Colonel.
