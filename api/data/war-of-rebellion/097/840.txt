General EMORY, Cumberland:

General Hancock directs to say that there is evidence that Mosby knew of Booth's plan to assassinate the President, and was at Washington with him, and that some of the gang are endeavoring to escape by crossing the Upper Potomac to get with Mosby or the secesh. Atzerodt, or Port Tobacco as eh is called, is known to have gone to Rockville Saturday to escape in that direction. The general disires you to be watchful that none of the assassins pass through your lines.

Respectfully,

W. G. MITCHELL,

Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.
