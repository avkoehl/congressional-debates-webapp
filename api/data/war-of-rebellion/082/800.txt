AUGUST 29, 1864.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL:

As there is no colonel at present and only six companies, with a lieutenant-colonel, let the regiment be rated hereafter as a battalion of six companies, and so treated in the promotions hereafter to occur. I do not see the necessity for disbandment.

J. A. S.

Secretary.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, July 25, 1864.

Lieutenant General R. S. EWELL,Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 23rd instant is received. I had understood that General Rains was in charge of the torpedoes on James River, and when Captain Bryan was sent from here I desired him to report to General Rains, or whoever might have the direction of the subject. Doctor Fretwell was brought to me by Lieutenant-Colonel Williams, of the engineers, who stated that Doctor Fretwell was acting under the chief engineer at Richmond. He applied for and received my permission to operate on James River so far as that permission was necessary, but I understood that the whole matter would be under the control and direction of General Rains, to whom he was directed to report. I did not contemplate sending independent parties. If General Rains is not in charge you had better select some competent officer, and put the whole matter and all the persons engaged in it under his control.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE.

General.
