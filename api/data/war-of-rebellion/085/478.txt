Your telegram received. I can get no answer from Cairo. Cannot account for the failure of the One hundred and thirty-sixth Regiment. Four Illinois regiments are now en route for Saint Louis.

Captain BENNETT,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have armed my quartermaster's men and I have no doubt they will render good service. As there are large numbers of employes at the cavalry bureau, would it not be well for you, now that Colonel Merrill has gone, to send out some officer to organize and equip this large number of employes?
