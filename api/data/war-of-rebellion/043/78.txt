HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 4, 1863-7 a. m. (Received 7. 20 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK:

This morning the enemy has withdrawn his pickets from the positions of yesterday. My own pickets are moving out to ascertain the nature and extent of the enemy's movement. My information is not sufficient for me to decide its character yet-whether a retreat or maneuver for other purposes.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

OPERATOR AT FREDERICK:

Please show copy of this to General French.

JULY 4, 1863-12 noon. (Received July 5, 3. 50 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington:

The position of affairs is not materially changed from my last dispatch, 7 a. m. The enemy apparently has thrown back his left, and placed guns and troops in position in rear of Gettysburg, which we now hold. The enemy has abandoned large numbers of his killed and wounded on the field. I shall require some time to get up supplies, ammunition, &amp;c., rest the army, worn out by long marches and three

days' hard fighting. I shall probably be able to give you a return of our captures and losses before night, and return of the enemy's killed and wounded in our hands.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

JULY 4, 1863.

Major ECKERT:

General Meade desires to know under whose orders and authority the telegraph operators possessing the cipher are appointed and controlled. The operator, Mr. Caldwell, at these headquarters presumes to act in an independent manner, and has left headquarters for Westminster, selecting his own location, without authority or permission. The commanding general is unable to send dispatches from these headquarters in cipher in consequence thereof, or to understand those he receives.

DANL. BETTERFIELD,

Major-General, and Chief of Staff.

JULY 4-10 p. m. (Received July 6, 6. 10 a. m.)

Major-General HALLECK:

No change of affairs since dispatch of 12 noon. I make a reconnaissance to-morrow, to ascertain what the intention of the enemy is. My cavalry are now moving toward the South Mountain Pass, and, should the enemy retreat, I shall pursue him on his flanks.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
