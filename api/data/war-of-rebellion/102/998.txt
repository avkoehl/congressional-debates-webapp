OFFICE MEMPHIS AND SAINT LOUIS PACKET COMPANY,

Saint Louis, June 26, 1865.

Major-General POPE,

Commanding Department [Division] of the Missouri:

DEAR SIR: The soldiers returning to Missouri from the Confederacy admit they are shipped for good, and they appear to be the most orderly set of men in the State, and now they ought to be protected. The Government has sent them home, and should protect them against little radical cliques in the interior of the State. I voted for Lincoln and Johnson, and claim the right to ask that now, when these men want to quietly go to work and redeem the last four years, that they should be helped to do it. I don't suppose they care who are rulers or governors, so that a just policy be pursued. I don't think they care a fig whether the negro votes or not, so that good government obtains. If a right course be pursued toward them Missouri will recover astonishingly quick. As an old soldier of the war of 1812, I know all the magnanimity a soldier feels toward a fallen and vanquished foe. I have, helped to build up the State from beginning, and I feel a deep interest in its honor and justice.

Truly,

N. RAMSEY.
