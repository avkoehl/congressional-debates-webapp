most splendid execution upon them with canister, killing and wounding large numbers. During the whole day the batteries were subjected to a terrible artillery fire, which destroyed a large number of horses in the best cover I could obtain, and exploded two limber-chests. When the lines were abandoned every effort was made by my officers and men to save their guns, and although left without infantry support, with the enemy almost upon them, they succeeded in almost every instance in limbering up, and then had so many horses shot down as to be unable to haul their guns through the heavy soil to the pike. I lost in the lines the following guns, 16 in all:

Courtney's battalion:

Dent's battery ............................................. 4

Douglas' battery ........................................... 1

Garrity's battery .......................................... 2

Johnston's battalion:

Rowan's battery ............................................ 4

Corput's battery ........................................... 1

Eldridge's battalion:

Stanford's battery ......................................... 4

I also lost some caissons. The horses which were unhurt were mostly saved. The twelve guns saved from the lines were immediately placed in position and used with good effect in protecting the retreat of the army.

On the morning of the 17th I was ordered to leave the five guns of

Courtney's battalion with General Stevenson, who was conducting the rear guard. During the day the enemy's cavalry dashed into our lines on the pike, between the divisions of Generals Stevenson and Clayton, and captured the three guns of Douglas' battery. They destroyed the harness and had to cut down the guns, and when we recaptured them we could not carry them off and were compelled to abandon them. Three of the guns of Fenner's battery were subsequently abandoned by order of General Forrest, he finding it impossible to save them; and two guns of McKenzie's battery, which had been ordered to report to Lieutenant-General Stewarat, were left by him on the other side of Duck River and abandoned, as the pontoon bridge was taken up, the commanding officer having been previously refused permission to cross; this, however, was after you had relinquished command.

I regret that it is out of my power to furnish a list of casualties, none having been previously called for, and two of my battalions having been ordered away. My loss was small, however, except in Stanford's battery, which lost 12 men killed and wounded.

Captain Rowan, a good and gallant officer, was killed by a shell on the morning of the 16th.

In conclusion, I would say that the officers and men of my command exhibited the greatest coolness and gallantry during the fight and subsequent retreat; that they did all in their power to save their guns; and that they feel most keenly the misfortune which has disarmed them at a moment so perilous for their country, and ask your earnest intercession to place them again in the field at an early day.

Very respectfully,

L. HOXTON,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant General S. D. LEE.
