HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,February 6, 1865.

Brigadier General H. L. BENNING, Commanding Division:

The enemy attempted to-day to cross White Oak Swamp. General Gary has been instructed to resist such attempts and, in case of an endeavor to cross at Mrs. Hobson's, to call on General Bratton for infantry support. The whole brigade can be used if required. Will you direct General Bratton to obey any such call. Send a scout or two down the Barbytown road to gain information of any advance of the enemy to-day.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION,February 6, 1865.

[Major R. P. DUNCAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:]

MAJOR: Colonel Tabb, commanding Wise's brigade, reports that the enemy's pickets came out yesterday evening with knapsacks on, and, from their ignorance of the picket-line, it is presumed they were new troops. He also reported that the enemy had moved four or five guns out of the fort on the reserve picket-line nearly in front of Rives' Salient; the tents also in the woods near Webb's house have been in a good measure moved off. The following casualties are reported: Ransom's brigade, one wounded.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,February 6, 1865.

Brigadier General M. W. GARRY, Commanding Cavalry:

Your dispatch has been received. If your pickets are attacked you had better strengthen them. Under all circumstances they must resist any attempt to cross the swamp, and only give way under masses of the enemy. Should an attempt be made to cross the swamp at Mrs. Hobson's you can call on General Bratton, who is on Field's left, to assist you in preventing the crossing. General Field will be instructed to this effect. General Bratton can use his whole brigade if required.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
