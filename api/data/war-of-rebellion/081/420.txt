Major-General BUTLER:

Have ordered the J. Johnson to leave at once, and if you direct I will send the Greyhound. These are the only boats I have except the tugs, three in number. Have sent to City Point for a boat to start from there. If any go will not use the Greyhound, and will inform which ones they are.

Send any steam-boats you have that will take 1,000 men to the hospital wharf at Point of Rocks. This needs the utmost haste.

[Major-General BUTLER:]

GENERAL: The expedition toward Kinston, made to amuse the enemy toward Goldsborough, while more important work was to be performed below, has returned. The commander of this portion of the forces has reported the capture of a large number of prisoners and horses. I hope to report good things from below very soon. The news from Kinston has just been sent to me by the officer who was in command, but who has not yet reported fully. The train is just leaving for Morehead, where the steamer is waiting.

I. N. PALMER,Brigadier-General.
