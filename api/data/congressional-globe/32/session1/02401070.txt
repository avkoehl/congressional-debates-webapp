THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 14,
rights of the Southern States, they are therefore
to he proscribed, they will probably feel it to be .
due to their own dignity and self-respect to pro- •
scribe you in return. Lightly as gentlemen may ,
think of it, this view of the subject may be found |
worthy of consideration. There are in the States |
of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi alone, one J
hundred thousand State-Rights men. Proscribe j
them, proscribe the organ that more nearly than !
any other in this city reflects their views, and do j
it because of those views, and I tell you, S. will 1
not be accountable for the manner in which they !
wJi dispose of their votes. They may not ask i
favors at your hands for themselves or for any ;
one else, but they may fee] it to be due to their i
own self-respect to resent an insult—to resent pro- !
scription. I will not undertake to say what they j
will do. I am not authorized, as I have said be- :
fore, to state what their future action will be; but I
do feel authorized, iu a friendly way, to suy that |
you should be cautious how you act. You may :
endanger the success of your pi esulential candidate.
You may endanger a matter infinitely more impor-
tant to me than the pubiw printing. You may en-
danger the patronage of the President, and the distri-
bution of the §50,000,000. A little caution and a
little good temper, properly exercised,and a slight
spnnkle of justice and common sense, may sa\e
a deal of trouble by and by. It is one thing to
give up that which is ones due voluntarily, and it
is another thing to have it snatched away, and
that in so rude a manner as to give offense. I re-
peat again that I do not want any part of this
printing for any friend of mine on earth. But
1 shouid not like to be told that certain patties
could not have it because they were my friends.
And I think it likely this may be the feeling of a
great many Southern people.
1 do not care, sir, to pursue this discussion. I
have said about all that 1 caie to say, and if I go >
further, I may say that which had better be left j
unpaid. The concluding portion of my remarks, j
I throw out only as a friendly warning to my ]
political brethien here. They can receive them in
a friendly spirit or not. I want it to be understood, ^
and it is all I have to say, that when proscription :
commences for opinion's sake, there can be pro- .
scription upon one side as well as upon the other. |
I oifer the following resolution. It is not my j
own, and does not fully meet my approbation, i
A friend has handed it to me, with a request that |
1 should oiler it. I do so in compliance with his
request:
<• Resolved, That thf*  oporf nf tlio Committee on Print-
ing be oMened to the Committee on the Judicial v, with ni-
stiactions to repoit upon the whole subject, ami to recoin- j
m< nd lor the adoption ol stieh a sjt-toni lor the j

Mr. .BROWN. The Judiciary Committee hed
been selected, because in taking thi^ eontiaet, if it
must be taken, out of the hands of Hamilton, and
disposing o{ it otheiwixe, le al questions must
necessarily arNe, which it will be better to have
passed upon by the Judiciary Committee than any
other. I have done, sir.
Mr. FLORENCE. I move to amend the in-
structions by adding thereto the woids, " and that
they especially take into consideration the follow-

( The ^FKAivER. Does the gentleman from
' PeunsyU ama withdraw ins motion made yester-
! day to 1 eeouimu the bill?
| iVir. FLOiiEACE. i do, if the proposition i
! ha\e submitted wiil then be in order.
1 The ivEit. it will ue in order.
I Mi. I'T^OitE-NC E. Tiieu I withdraw my mo-
i tiou to 1 econimit, mid submit tiie proposition to
| amend tiie instructions moved by the gentleman
i from Mississippi, [Mr. Brown.]
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. Is it in older to
amend a resolution by a bill for an act of Con-
gress ?
The SPEAKER. Tlie gentleman from Penn-
sylvania has the floor, and proposes to amend the
instructions to the Judiciary Committee, that they
consider specially the propriety of reporting the
bill indicated by him.
Mr.JONES, ofTennessee. They are instructed
in the resolution of the gentleman from Missis-
sippi, to take into consideration the establishment
of a Government bureau.
The SPEAKER. The Chair understands the
gentleman from Pennsylvania as proposing to add
these words: "That the said committee shall con-
sider specially the propriety of adopting and re-
porting the particular bill."
Mr. FLORENCE. Yes, sir, if it is in order.
Tlie SPEAKER. It is 111 order, in the opinion
of the Chair. Does the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania desire to address the House*
Mi. FLORENCE. I do, sir.
The proposition to amend was then read.
Mr.STAiNLY. Will the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania allow me to ask him a question. I de-
sire to know, sit, if this bill, or the resolution of
the gentleman fiom Mississippi, makes any pro-
vision for the printing of the present session of
Congress until that bill shall be enacted into a
law ^
Mr. FLORENCE. The last section directs
the Committee on Public Printing to contract with
any person, after ten days' advertisement, for the
work that the public printer laiis to execute. It
is the same as the resolution which the gentleman
will find reported in the Globe of this moining,
and which I offered yesterday.
J Mr. STANLY. Of course, that does not oper-
; ate until this law is enacted.
! Mr. FLORENCE. Thereis not any provision
! for the purpose su?:<rested by the gentleman from
1 North Carolina, [Mr. Stanly,] for I take it for
: granted that the public printer is able—if he is per-
mitted to do so—to complete the work for which
he has contracted: at least, such is his declaration.
Mr. Speaker, I do not desire to detain the House
for a very long time in reference to a subject so fruit-
ful, and the cause of so much agitation,as the pub-
he printing has been for the last quarter of a cen-
tury. 1 desire only to go briefly through the his-
tory, as I best can, fiom a recollection of the
circumstances and facts, of the many ungenerous
attacks that have been made upon the gentleman
now holding the contract, and to assume the posi-
tion, which, to my mind, is incontrovertible, that
this is the reason why he is not able to perform his
work, and the sole cause of the present difficulty
in relation to it. But before I proceed with that, I
desue to say that 1 do not agree with my friend
from Mississippi, that the contract system ever
can be perfected. I do not believe that it is sus-
ceptible of any improvement. My acquaintance
with the plan, method, or mode bv which contracts
for ail the supplies of the Government are gener-
ally entered into, justifies me in this conclusion.
Now, sir, every gentleman who is engaged in
commercial or any other of thevaiious mercantile
pursuits, or who has ever had an opportunity of
contracting with the Government, is acquainted
! with the plan which it is very generally under-
' stood is adopted. Why, sir, I can take up any
;j newspaper 111 which the proposals aie published
ji foY contracts with the Government, and show the
mannei in which they are iiiven out. Ifanygen-
■( tieman here has a copy of the Republic, with him
: of this morning, I will be much obliged to him
I for it, and [ will give a sort of illustration, as I
i understand it, how contracts are obtained at low
j prices.
,! [A Member here handed a copy of the Repub-
;j he to Mr. Florence.]
' For instance, Mr. Speaker, here is an adver-
j ti^ement for small stores, issued by the Bureau of
j Provisions and Clothing. Well, sir, those gentle-
,! men who are familiar with the subject ol taking
I contracts, may perhans (1 do not wish to asperse
' anybody) have a friend at court—one of the clerks
in the Department, perhaps—who knows the exact
' quantity of articles that are required, and who
i mfoims tlie bidder for the supplies that so many
of one article is lequiied, and so many of another;
; and the consequence is. that thegeutieman making
|i the proposal agrees to supply a certain article, of
;[ which very few are wanted, at a very low price.
