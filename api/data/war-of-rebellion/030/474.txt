possession of the rich lands of Greenbrier and Monroe when the spring opens. I should prefer having some other troops than those I sent from the department. I do not mean by this to reflect injuriously on those troops, but I think they would be more serviceable at a greater distance from their homes.

With great respect and esteem, your obedient servant,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA, Dublin, December 31, 1862.

Brigadier-General MARSHALL, Bristol:

Nine hundred of Jenkins' men have passed here in the cars for Bristol, Colonel Dunn commanding, and ordered to report to you. They ought to be at Bristol to-night. If it is possible to intercept the enemy, besides defending the road and salt works, I am sure you will do it.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA, Dublin, December 31, 1862.

Brigadier-General JENKINS, Salem:

Your note by Major Whidney received. Do not start to join your men at Bristol unless your health will fully warrant it. The enemy has no baggage or train, and will probably start back before we can attack them. I am much pleased with the prompt movement of your command.

BUBLIN, December 31, 1862.

Brig. Gen. HUMPHREY MARSHALL, Bristol:

Nine hundred of Jenkins' men have passed here in the cars for Bristol, Colonel Dunn commanding, and ordered to report to you. They ought to be at Bristol to-night. If it is possible to intercept the enemy, besides defending the road and the salt works, I am sure you will do it.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

The general would suggest that you will have the operator at Abing don sent to Bristol. You, however, being on the spot, can judge best.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

WM. B. MYERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
