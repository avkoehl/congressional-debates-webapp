general Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia, could be ordered to report to me, as he has been on my staff since the opening of the war, and since the recent battles have reduced the number of general officers by the capture of Johnson and Steuart, there seems to be a surplus of staff officers in the corps.

R. S. EWELL,

Lieutenant-General.

JUNE 13, 1864.

Major RIELY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

DEAR MAJOR: Please cause the above paragraph* to be issued in the special orders of to-day, and send a copy to General Ewell. I have left the designation of the department blank, as I do not recollect it at this moment, but a reference to the order assigning General Ransom to its command. I think it is either the Department of Richmond or Department of Henrico.

Respectfully, yours,

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS, June 13, 1864.

DIVISION AND ARTILLERY COMMANDERS:

General Anderson desired you to put your division in motion to cross the Chickahominy by the first Federal bridge below New Bridge, and thence on toward Riddell's Shop (near White Oak Swamp). Your wagons and artillery had better pass by New Bridge. The road to the Federal bridge leads directly by Doctor Gaines' house and turns to the right after crossing Powhite Creek, and again to the right about 200 yards farther on.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,G. M. SORREL,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

SWIFT CREEK, June 13, 1864 - 7 a. m.

General BRAXTON GRAGG:

After conference last night with Captain Pegram, C. S. Navy, have concluded to run risk of arming river battery at Howlett's. Object in view so great I hope War and Navy Departments will afford me all assistance possible.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

SWIFT CREEK, June 13, 1864.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

General Dearing reports:

I learn from scouts seven transports with troops passed up James River yesterday for Bermuda Hundred or City Point, to operate against Petersburg; most likely latter.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.
