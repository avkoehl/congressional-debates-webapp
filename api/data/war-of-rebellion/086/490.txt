LEWISBURG, November 8, 1864-9.20 p. m.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Little Rock:

From what I can gather from our scouts and a prisoner they brought in it seems that on the 25th of October Brooks had a light skirmish at Fayetteville and fight on the 28th. November 3 and 4 Shelby fought the garrison, while Price retreated via Cane Hill. Near the latter place Price burned what he left of his train with the expectation of four wagons loaded with ordnance stores. The enemy have three or five pieces of artillery. McCray, Jackman, Dobbin, and Newton had left for White River.
