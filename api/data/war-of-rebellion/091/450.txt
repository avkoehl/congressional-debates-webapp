CHARLESTON, W. VA., October 22, 1864-9.15 p. m.

Colonel R. F. TAYLOR,

Camp Piatt:

Lieutenant-Colonel Polsley telegraphs me he expects to be attacked early in the morning, but by no more than he can handle. Keep your men in hand ready to render every assistance. Notify your men at Kelly's Creek to move up to his assistance if called upon. Keep scouts out well on your right. Guard Paint Creek well.

JOHN H. OLEY,

Colonel, Commanding.

CHARLESTON, W. VA., October 22, 1864.

Colonel THOMAS,

Gallipolis:

Five hundred rebels have appeared on my right. I think they will endeavor to get below here on the river. Are you at liberty to assist me, if necessary, the same as when General Sullivan was here? Telegraph.

JOHN H. OLEY,

Colonel, Commanding First Separate Brigade.

CHARLESTON, W. VA, October 22, 1864.

Captain E. B. BLUNDON,

Guyandotee, W. Va.:

The rebel Colonel Witcher, with 500 men, was at the Marshy Fork of the Coal River yesterday. I think he will try to get down in the Guyandotte country. Fortify and be vigilant. I will watch him and help you all I can if necessary. If the comes fight him at all hazards and act in connection with Winfield and Coalsmouth.

JOHN H. OLEY,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
HDQRS. FIRST SEPARATE BRIGADIER, DEPT. OF WEST VIRGINIA,Charleston, W. Va., October 22, 1864.

Major-General HOOKER,

Cincinnati, Ohio:

I occupy the Kanawha Valley with two cavalry regiments, posted from Guyandotte to Gauley, W. Va.-one regiment mounted and armed, the other dismounted and partly armed. Deserters and refugees state that Breckinridge intends moving this way with a superior force. General Crook is with General Sheridan, and it takes several days to communicate with him. I would, therefore, most respectfully ask that the force at Gallipolis may be ordered to assist me if necessary.

JOHN H. OLEY,

Colonel, Comdg. First Separate Brigade, Dept. of West Virginia.
