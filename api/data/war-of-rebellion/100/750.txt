His Excellency President DAVIS:

(Care of General H. H. Walker, Danville, Va.)

See telegrams of yesterday and to-day to General Walker. I consider railroad from Chester to Danville safe, at present. Will send to-day 600 more men to latter point. Twenty-five hundred more could be sent, if absolutely needed, but they are returned men of various commands in Army of Tennessee, temporarily stopped and organized here. General Hillsborough to Danville. No news from Lee or Johnston. Please answer.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

DANVILLE, VA. April 4, 1865.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Greensborough, N. C.:

Your telegram of to-day received. The reports in regard to raiders very contradictory. Best evidence indicates that they have not been at Madison. The cavalry you have ordered here will be of special value at this time, and with the infantry en route will probably serve the immediate necessity. Have sent courier to General Lee, from whom I have no communication.

JEFF'N DAVIS.

General R. E. LEE,

Stoneman's commands is reported to have crossed Yadkin at Jonesville and Rockford on 2nd instant, p. m., and moved toward Dobson and Mount Airy, destination probably Taylorsville. From there he may continue to Lynchburg, if he is protecting flank of column reported moving along Virginia and Tennessee Railroad; or from Taylorsville he may march on Danville.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
