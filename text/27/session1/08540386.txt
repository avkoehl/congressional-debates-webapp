why,&if, if rumor speaks the truth—I mean umor with a
thousand tongues, not the * Rumor" at the other end of the
Cipitol, that has occasionally been mo3umpiopeiiy introduced

tn,e Prte«ident*s own handwriting, and us provisions sanctioned

fíe «amits that its powers are seemingly more limited than
háv% heretofore been granted to such institutions 'Eveiy
United States Bank heretofore created has " he says ' had
power to deal in billa of exchange, as well as in local dis
countaf^&hd it was because he objected to the powei of local
discounts, contrary to the sen^e oí all the Whig party in both
Housetíj that the operation of this bill was confined to bills of
excharfges Which limitation he himself deemed indispensable,
aftcrriow it lsenumeiated with the objections tothetiil And
afteiithua undertaking to show that it is a national m«n union,
■which no man m his senses ever dreamed of disputing, he as
snjmesthatit may "be regarded as a local bank oí the District
of Columbia, invested by Congress with general oowerb to ope
jtj/,* t,ver tli© Union, and it is theiefore obm xious to sill
stMnger objections" The message continue* llt assumes
that Cangress may invest a local institution with General oí na
t onal powers " This view is precisely what the President as
sumeefwhen he fiist proposed thit Congie** asa local Legis
tature, should establish a local bankm the Disturt of Colum-
bia, and then invest it. with general u^es and nanonal powers,
with the assent of the Sates and the idea wa<= laughed into
ridicule; and when he perhaps becomes ashamed of u himself,
he endeavors to turn his own absurd absu actions upon Confess,

stanttally a system of discounts of the m >&t objectionable
character," though, as I havebelme b-iid u \ as limited m its

His next objection is, thaf "there is no limit pi escribed to the
premiumm tne puieha^e of bilK oí exchange " Well, mi,an
one portion of om countrymen would say, I incline to calm
late that H would put th financial skill ol the Presuletint(who,
