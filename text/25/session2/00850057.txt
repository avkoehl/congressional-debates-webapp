on that floor. He thought it better, therefore, to
waive the constitutional or legal right than to de-
prive the States of Mississippi and Arkansas (for the
latter must have been included) of their voice here.
This was the reason for the vote he then gave. Now
the question assumed, a totally different form. The
(question now is, whether that House should
elect two members to represent Mississippi on that
floor, er whether the people of Mississippi should
elect their own members. He should, therefore,
when in order, submit a resolution similar to the
one he had indicated
Mr GRAVES then modified his resolution, so
as to read thus:
Resolved, That S S. Prentiss, andT J Word,
who claim their seats as members from the State
of Mississippi, be admitted to seats on the floor of
this halt, and, it they choose, have leave to parti-
cipate m any debates that may grow out of it
Mr G explained that his motion had no refer-
ence to, nor was intended to interfere with, Mr
CAMBRELENG'8 motion. Mr G'swas a pre-
liminary1 motion.
Mr. HAMER had but a few words to say on
this subject at, present The gentlemen, who had
presented their memorials, had not been introduced
upon, the floor and sworn as members, according
to what he understood to be the intimation of the
gentleman from Tennessee There were already
two members there from the State of Mississippi,
occupying their seats in accordance with the deci-
sion of the House, and it would, indeed, be a
strange anomaly to admit two more members, a
double delegation, to take seats also The latter
could not possibly, at this stage, be admitted and
qualified by the Speaker.
Mr H was also opposed to the proposition of
the first gentleman from Kentucky, (Mr Graves,)
because he believed it to be both unusual and im-
proper to admit those gentlemen on the floor until
a report on the subject was made by a committee
of the House.
What was the question then before them' It was
the question, and that alone, what should be done
with the memonal presented by the gentlemen
claiming to be entitled to seats occupied by others.
And-that was, a question to be determined by the
House first, without hearing any aigument that
might be made for the object of the memorial.
Why, they might reject it, ornot receive it, or lay it,
or the motion to i eceive it, on thetable. They might
sen e it as they did the abolition memorials Those
gentlemen stood m the same predicament precisely
as all other memorialists did—subject to the preli-
minary disposition of the memorial itself Oth r-
memonahsfcs weie not allowed to come in upon
the floor, and partake m debate on their me-
morials , and why should they' He should, there-
fore, vote against that proposition
Mr H was m favor of referring this matter to
the Committee of Elections, because he wanted to
see a written aigument, if these gentlemen chose
to present one in support of their claim, and have
it printed and laid upon the tables of the members
H& wished also to see the constitution of Mississippi,
or inch parts of it as bore upon the case, printed
He desired also to see all the laws in relation
to it punted and laid on their tables, t >gether
wuh every other document that could illustrate the
case This was the uniform practice of the House,
and this was his reason for referring the subject to a
committee Let all these matters be reported upon,
and laid upon the tables of the members, and time
be given to consider them, and then, with great
pleasure, he would vote to hear these gentlemen
address the„House in support of their claims
One of the gentlemen from Kentucky, (Mr
Pope,) had remarked that the subject should not
be sent to the Committee of Elections, because
they had once made a decision a the case Now
Mr. H took two exceptions to this argument
first, he denied that they had decided this
case, for this claim had never been befoiethem
It was true, they decided that the gentlemen
who now occupy the spats were then en-
titled to them, but it might be that, upon a re-
view of this case, upon an examination of all that
might now be presented, they might decide the
other way There was, too, even then, a strong
minority in the committee, who is ere of a different
opinion, and they presented the other side of ihe
question
Secondly if it be a reason that this subject
should not be referred, as a preliminary step, to a
committes, because a majority of the committee
had once made a decision, surely it was equally a
rea&on why the- House itself was incompetent to de-
cade it, because a majority of that House had once
decided in favor of the sitting members The one
was as applicable as the other, and then it might as
well be asked, why present the memorial at all1 If
the committee were incompetent, so was the House
The gentleman furthermore informs us that the
claims of these gentlemen for their seats must be
sent, or ought to be sent, if sent at all, to a com-
mittee composed of membeis favorable to the
claimants Why, how was the Chair, or how was
the House to ascertain that fact? Cou'd eitbet
know the opinions of mdividu íl member-.' Why,
even supposing the «lluns; members were to vacile
then seat , who could at once say that the claim-
ants had brought papers, certificates, and docu-
ments, to prove they were entitled to them?
Could it be said that the House would, even m
that ease, take upon itself to decide without a re-
ference to the committee having charge of the sub-
ject?
In conclusion, m every view which Mr H was
able to take of this case, he was for sending th°
papers to the Committee of Elections, and l"t
them take the usual course of all similar papers,
viz be printed, laid on the tibies of the members,
and then duly examined
Mr GRAVES had expressed no opinion, e ther
m favor or against the claimants, nor even an
opinion as to the propriety of reference The litter
was a point not necessary to be deeded, or even
discussed at that stage, in order to decide upon hi<-
proposition The discussion of that ques ion, how-
ever, only rendered the adoption of his resolution
the more requisite as a preliminary step , for he
held it to be proper that the claimants should be
heard on the motion of reference if they wished it
Mr TILLINGHAST, m reply to the member
fiom Ohio, Mi HAMER, contended that the gen-
tlemen now claiming their seats were not placed in
the same situation as other memoralists, who never
had their memorials referred to the judges, who
had voted against them In Ins opinion, as a simple
matter of justice, the claimants hid a light to seats
on the floor, in order to meet and ariswei any argu
ments in the House against them, and coming fiom
an interested source, and to trace them to their
foundation The subject was one of paramount
importance, affecting the representation of the na-
tion, and therefore it was imperative on the House
to give every opportunity of investigating the
charges before it, and of piobing the ma'ter to
the bottom. The member from Ohio had reform!
to the decision of the Comm ttee of Election 
at the late special session, but he would ask
him on what did that committee decide' They
had reported on the warrant of the Govern-
or, whicu called upon the people of the State
of Mississippi to vote for the election of represent-
atives to sen e until the period arrived for the re-
gular annual elections Yet, m ihe face ol that and
other facts, they had made a report which declared
that Mes'is Claiborne and Gholson, representa-
tives from the State of Mississippi, had been duly
elected to serve for the whole of the twenty-fifth
Congress He was therefore averse to the refe-
rence of the subject again to that committee, as it
would p'ace them in an unpleasant position, and
compel them either to fortify their lormer decision,
or to revoke it entirely He considered that a re-
ference to any other committee would answer ttee
purpose equally as well, as all they had to do u as
simply to ascertain the facts But to lefer the sub-
ject a second time to the Committee of Elections
would be of no utility, as they had already exa-
mined the facts, and reported thereon
Mr W THOMPSON thought that, as a matter
of abstract right, the gentlemen from Mississippi
ought to be admitted on the floor. He did not
know whether those gentlemen desired a reference
of the subjeet, or not, but hs would like to hear
them, and would have lilted to have heard them at
the last session, before he gave his vote on the sub-
ject    But still he was m favor of a leference of
ihe matter to a commi'tee
Mr CLAIBORiNE said that, so far as he was
personally cencerned, so far as bis wishes on this
subject could influence the action of his friends, he
hoped that all opposition to the lesolution of the
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr Graves) would be
withdrawn When the question was m abeyance
at the extra sessKin, relatue to the right of his
colleague and himself to their seats, although
we did not participate in the debate here,
we appeared before the Committee ot Elec-
tions, and submitted an argument in support
of our claims The gentlemen from Mississippi
(Messrs Prentiss and Woid) appear here wuh
th ir certificates of election, and a-k to be heard
I hope that they will be In ish them to have an
opportum'v of sabmitt lg any statement of fact,
pnv argument, any appeal, th y may thnk proper.
If the proposition was to quakfy these gentlemen I
should object decided h fori could never so far
surrender my rights heie Sir, what are the facts'
My collpagueand myself acre elected in Julv last,
we chimed our ^pits, an hnnoiable member
from Virginia objected , the objection was over-
rn'fd, md aftc the usual piocess of investigation,
this House decided thu we were members
for the en'ire twenty-fiftn Congiess, we did not
sibmit our nim°s again as candidates, we consi-
dered the question as adjudicated, finally decided,
that there could be no appeal, and so thought our
political fnends m Mississippi A majority ef them
íefused to attend the polls But, sir, the gentlemen
at the bar think other? e, theu political friends
thins otheiwi c, thev were vo'edfor, they conduct-
ed tie canvass witn great fairness and liberality,
and I should do injustice to my own feelings to op-
pose any wish the j may entertain to appear, at this
'tage of the proceeding before the House
Mr TAYLOR thV ht there could not be the
slightest objection to the gent cmen from Missis-
sippi occupying seats m the House, as a m liter of
comtesy, until the case should have been finally
decided, but he could not agree to their being
allowed to take their seats, with a \íew ol d sou-
sing tne ments cf the quest on before tne House
Mi RLED thought it xvis nothing more than fair
to presume that the people of Missiswpp had m
fact elected four íepresematives At the late spe-
cial session, it was true that the House had declared
the tn 0 prevnt members as eltcted for the whole
Congress, but w iS not the vo ce of tne people to be
regarded' The people of Missi sippi hid now sent
two repiest ntd ives, m I </ieti vuce outfit to be re
gird°l lit, thought the clnmants, under those
circuni'-'ances, \ieie entitled to take their seats, in
Older to discuss the question Th-y were sent by
the peop'e, and tney hid a right to oc heard Tney
came with then ccitiiVates irom the people, and
whether they had been legally elected 01 not ihe
people of Mississippi thought st He applauded
the remarks of tie gentleman from Mississip, 1,
(Mr Claiborne,) one of 'he present members, for
e\ en he had expressed bis ie-.Dect for the opinions
of the people He (Mi R) saw no reason why
the gentlemen should not be permitted lo take their
seats
Mr BOON agieed with the gentleman from
Massachusetts that the voice of tne people of
Mississippi ought t) be re pec ed But he would
ask that gentlemvn, it then loioe had not been
airead v heard' He would ask, if it had not been
heaid during the recent session, vhen the piesent
subject was fully discu-sed and deliberated upon
by the Hons ' The f< ot was, tne people of Mis-
sissippi could five bu' tu o íepresentatives, and
those two men the present nembeis who had
been preuuts'v elected and whose eiec'ion had
ken confirmed by tne House for the whols Con-
gress, and how, he would ask, could two more be
admnted, without 'hee^pti'sionot those.gentlemen
Mr BELL legretted to see that, from a mere pre-
liminary a ues ¡on of reference, the discussion had
branched out into the merits of the subject But
only one side of the question had been stated Un-
der those circumstances lie thought it his duty to
give the opposite side ot the question. That oppo-
site side was, that there had been no decision of the
House where the people ot Mississippi had been
heard.   They had not feaen heard on the question
