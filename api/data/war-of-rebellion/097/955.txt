Major-General MEADE:

To avoid all misunderstanding telegraph again to General Wright to observe no truce not made by General Grant, but do all in his power to cut off the enemy's retreat. General Grant has reached Raleigh and ordered an immediate resumption of hostilities. The enemy's object now is to permit the leaders to escape south by their dilatory negotiations.
