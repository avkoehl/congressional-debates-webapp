his men ran the rebels out of that so fast they left everything behind, even $250 Confederate money, which, of course, they would hardly leave behind except under a very high pressure.

Burnside had best occupy Markham early to-day, or the rebels can get behind me in going to Chester Gap, and I will not be able to get out.

P. S. - Nothing yet from Averell of his losses.

CAMP NEAR SANDY HOOK, [VA.],

November 5, [1862] - 6.20 p. m.

COLONEL: I have been informed by several sources that the officers of the cavalry which engaged me to-day made many inquiries for the shortest and best route to Warrenton. Although they made for Chester Gap, I feel sure they are going to Warrenton. From all my explorations in this vicinity, I believe the enemy have passed the greater part of their force beyond this point some time since, and they may attempt to strike Sigel a blow near Warrenton. For me to follow up this ridge will take a good deal of time, and no infantry commands can follow on the roads with their trains, the roads are so bad. I should like the general's permission to strike in the direction of Warrenton or Culpeper, between which points I think I may find some of the enemy.

My command marched 12 miles to-day, and was fighting for six hours; pretty good day's work. I cannot say too much of my men and officers. Hurry up the carbine ammunition.

Very respectfully,

A. PLEASONTON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Colonel GEORGE D. RUGGLES.

CAMP NEAR SANDY HOOK, [VA.],

November 5, [1862] - 6.30 p. m.

COLONEL: Your dispatch of 3.50 p. m. received. Averell has been holding on to the Manassas with a section of artillery and three squadrons. The rest of his command is with me. A scout has just returned from. Chester Gap and reports nothing there. In the houses ahead of us are a number of wounded from to day's fight, among them 1 captain, Thirteenth Virginia Cavalry, mortally wounded. Five more wounded rebels have turned up in our lines, and several dead rebels were found by the scouting party on the road to the gap. If the general wishes me to keep on from here toward Flint Hill and Culpeper, Bayard ought to go toward Warrenton. Should he and I both strike that way we might make a good thing. Stuart and Hampton last night slept in the room from which I am now writing.

I send this by an aide, as directed.

Very respectfully,

A. PLEASONTON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Colonel A. V. COLBURN.

P. S. - I sent to headquarters two dispatches, 4.15, 6.20 p. m., containing all the news.
