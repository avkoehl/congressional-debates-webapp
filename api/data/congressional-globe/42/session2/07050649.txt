APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Expenditures of the Government—Mr. Beck.
Ho. of Reps.
Army, beyond what was requisite in former
years, will be readily understood without hav-
ing to resort to u deduction of expenditures
arising: in consequence of the rebellion in
1871."
The increase of expenditures in the Navy
can be also easily accounted for without any
suoh strained efforts as 0>e chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means hud to resort
to to make his tables answer his purposes. Ex-
ecutive Document No. 91. second session
Forty-First Oungrr-ss, will furnish one of the
many illustrations that could be given.
The House of Representatives having passed
the following resolution—
" Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury be,
and he is hereby, directed to report to this House
when and by what authority the r>nv and emolu-
ments, or either, of the oUicevs of the United States
Navy have been increased, the annual amount of
the increase, and its total amount since the increase
was made "—
fche Secretary of the Treasury caused his
Comptroller to furnish the information. He
set forth the order of the Secretary of the
Navy, arbi'rauly adding thirty-three per cent
to the pay o( the officers of the 2savy, and
added:
The order of the Secretary is the <Jnly author-
ity for payments beyond the respective salaries
allowed by J.jw, and puch payments have been cred-
ited to the disbursing officer", under the decision of
the Supreme Court, in the United States t>v. Jones,
(18 Howard, 9J.) i«i which it is held, among other
things "that theaecounring officers of the Treasury
have not the burden of responsibility can upon
them of revising the judgments, correcting the sup-
posed mistakes, or annulling the orders ol the heads
of Departments."
The second question of the resolution asks for
"the annual amount of the increase, and its total
amount since the increase was made."
A statement from the Fourth Auditor, of which
a copy is herewith transmitted, shows that the
increase of pay under the order of the Secretary

This is an approximate result, but I have no
doubt whatever of its substantial accuracy. If there
be erroi, it is not by over statement.
The resolution is herewith returned.
Very re pectfully, vour obedient servant,
J. AI. BHODHEAD. Comptroller.
Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell, Secretary of the Tteamry.
But it is useless to pursue that branch of
the statement in the tables any further. '1 here
are, doubtless, a number of items in the mis
ceilaneous appropriations for 1871, not strictly
necessary for the purpose of carrying on the
Government for that year, and if the gentle-
men from Massachusetts had examined the
items of expenditures in the §20,000.000
charged as miscellaneous in 1860. he would
have found many that it would have been
equally as just and proper to have stricken
fiom the expenditures of the Government for
that year as it. was to strike out those he has
done in his table for 1871, among others, such
items at $431,518 54 two and three per cent,
to the Stare of Missouri. $108,000; for patent
office buikit'ng, $219,573 53, pa'entfund. &c.;
but. he takes special care to do nothing of that
sort. On the contrary, the special object seems
to be to charge all that it is possible to do to
the account of 1800, and strike off everything
and omit to charge everything possible in the
Account of 1871, and then call it a fair com-
parison.
it will be observed that in the table of the
gentleman from Massachusetts and in the re-
pot t of the Secretary (for in that they agree)
the expenditures of the War Department for
1871 are stated at $35,799,991 82, which is
$8,280 093 13 less than the amount actually
expended by that. Department iti that year, as
the following "detailed statement, which will be
That statement shows unquestionably that
the expenditures of the War Department for
1871 exceeded $44,000 000; the items making
up that sum are given. How are the expenses
reduced to a Iraeiion over thirty five million
dollars V By the sales of ordnance? Who owned
the ordnance? Who paid for it when it was
originally purchased? Of course it was paid
for and owned by the people of the United
States. How then can the agents who have
charge of if reduce their expenditures, which
they admit were over forty-four million dollars
to about thirty-live million dollars by selling the
pioperty of their emplojers? If that sort of
process is allowed, all the managers of the
War Department have to do will be to sell an
amount of the people's property equal to the
amount they expend, no matter how much
that may'be, and their system of book-keep-
ing will prove that they have spent nothing.
I hardlv think any private gentleman would
be satisfied with such an account if exhibited
by his agent.
Mr. Speaker, the truth is, and no amount
of sophistry nor tables of figures, no matter
bow artfully prepared, can shake it in the
minds of intelligent men who examine the
subject, that the—

by and vouched for by the distinguished chair-
man of the Committee of Ways and ileans.
In the face ot such facts, it is useless to talk
about the comparative taxation per capita on
the people iu 1800 and 18/1. We all know
the iticiease of papulation during the last
decade was about twenty-two percent.; it is
easy to tiguie out the actual increase ot taxa-
tion. When gentlemen draw on their imagina-
tion for their facts, the figures must correspond
with their fancy sketches. This much is cer-
tain, in 1860 the average rate of tariff taxa-
tion was nineteen per tent, on dutiable®, with
a very large free list; in 1871 the average
taxation oil dutiable articles was forty eight
per cent.., with not oniv a very small tree list
but with tariff duties so adjusted as to make
the indirect or protective lax greatly more
burdensome to the consumer than the amount
of revenue derived wonld indicate. Ihe Sec-
retary of the Treasury iu bis finance report for
1871 gives the amount collected bj taxation
from the pet/pie, which found its way into the
Treasury, as follows:

When it i<* recollected that $183,000,000 will

■wonder by what arithmetic it can be proved
that they, having increased in numbers only
twenty two per cent, since 1880, are taxed
less tban they were in 1860 when $200 000,000
in addition to the $183,000,000 is annually
wrung from them now by taxation, while $56,-
000.000 was the whole amount of their taxa-
tion in 1860.
It is true w>e paid as premiums in the pur-
chase of our own bonds to the holders of tftem
in the year 1870 $15,996,o5a 00, and in 1871
$9,016,794 74, making in these two years thus
paid as premiums to bondholders $20,013,-
3-50 34. These are regaided as extraordinary
expenditures in the calculation of the gentle-
man from Massachusetts. 1 agree that they
are not only extraordinary'but outrageous ex-
penditures. Ir.deed, I have been amazed that
| the taxpayers ol the country have so loegaod so
! tamely submitted to the extortion. That pre-
mium has been and is now being paid upon
what are known as the five twenty bonds of
the United States, so called, because by the
terms of their issue the Government had the
right to pay them at any time alter five years,
and was bound to pay them in twenty years
alter their date, 'lhey were autboiized and
issued more than five years prior to 1870 by
the same law whieh authorized the issue of
the legal tender notes. The principal of the
bonds was, by the distinct terms of the law,
; made payable in these notes, the in'erest
being payable in gold, and we have required
customs duties to be \ aid in gold evev since,
so as to have an ample fund to meet our gold-
\ interest obligations. On the back of each
1 legal-tender note is the followingindorsement:
; This note is a legal tender at its face value for all
debts public and private, except duties on imports
and interest on the public debt."
The purchasers of these bonds bought them
. at par with greenbacks when one dollar in gold
was worth at least two in paper, let, by an
act passed by a liepubl can Congress two years
ago, without consideration and in violation ol
the right of their constituents, $26,000,000
! have been paid as a ptetaium in two y.ars in
the purchase of these bonds which the United
States had the right to call in and pay for m
the same currency with winch th. y wt-te pdr-
, chased, anil in which they were payable, and
1 which every soldier, sai.or, pensioner o> other
creditor of the Government has to take and is
glad to get. Yet gentlemen prate about an
economical administration of the Government
