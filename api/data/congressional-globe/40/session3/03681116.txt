The bill directs that the Secretary of the

Adams, mother of G. W. Adams, late a private
in company G, thirty-ninth Missouri infantry
volunteers, to be placed on the pension-roll,
at the rate of eight dollars per month, to com-
mence September 27, 1864, and to continue
during her widowhood.
The report was read.
Mr. HOLMAN. If the facts be true as
stated in the report of the committee, this lady
can obtain a pension through the Pension Office.
The report presents this fact, that this lady was
dependent upon her son for support, and had
been for many years before his death. It
appears that he died in the service, and she is
therefore entitled to a pension under the gen-
eral pension laws. If she is clearly entitled
to such a pension, of course Congress ought
not to pass such a_bill.
Mr. BENJAMIN. The party making appli-
cation in this case is well known to me and has
been for years. Her son, a young man of
twenty years of age enlisted in the thirty-ninth
Missouri volunteers, and in less than a month
was massacred at Centralia, on the North Mis-
souri railroad, with two hundred others. It was
the most barbarous massacre during the war.
He was the support of his mother, who is now
over seventy years of age. The case was re-
ferred to the Pension Bureau, and they reported
to the Pension Committee that on the present-
ation of certain testimony in regard to the
celibacy of this party the pension would be
granted. I know very well that the proof was
furnished, but it has been mislaid or lost, and
the case has not been acted upon by the Pen-
sion Bureau either favorably or unfavorably.
Mr. HOLMAN. Do the facts before the
committee justify the report in this case?
Mr. BENJAMIN. The proof was complete.
Mr. HOLMAN. Then it is clear that the
Commissioner of Pensions ought to grant this
pension.
Mr. BENJAMIN. He would grant it, but
the papers have been lost.
Mr. HOLMAN. How, then, are the commit-
tee able to act without papers.
Mr. BENJAMIN. We have acted on proof
furnished outside of the papers, and I will in-
form gentlemen that the proof is complete.
The bill was then ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time ; and being engrossed,
ic was accordingly read the third time, and
Mr. BENJAMIN moved to reconsider the
vote by which the bill was passed: and also
moved that the motion to reconsider be laid on
the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
WILLIAM H. M'DONALD.
Mr. PERHAM, from the same committee,
also reported a bill (H. R. No. 1962) granting
a pension to William H. McDonald; which was
read a first and second time.
The bill directs the Secretary of the Interior
to place upon the pension-roll, subject to the
provisions and limitations of the pension laws,
the name of AVilliam H. McDonald, late private
in company E. first regiment Michigan cavalry,
commencing November 17, 1865.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time ; and being engrossed, it was
accordingly x'ead the third time, and passed.
Mr. PERHAM moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed ; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
ADVERSE REPORTS.
Mr. PERHAM. I now desire to report back
to the House, in order that they may be laid
on the table, a large number of cases which
are covered by the provisions of the act of July,
18G8. I do not ask that their titles shall be
read in detail, as they are of no practical con-
sequence. I ask to report them in gross.
Mr. KELLEY. I ask the gentleman whether
there is not a gross of them ? [Laughter. ]
Mr. PERHAM. Oh, more than that.
Mr. HOLMAN. If this report is made it
has got to go on the Journal, but if it is not
made it goes back simply to the files, and an-
other report is made on the subject at the ensu-
ing Congress.
Mr. McKEE. Will they not be entered in
the Globe, so that we can see what they are ?
The SPEAKER. If they are reported
they must be entered on the Journal. It is
not necessary to make these adverse reports.
Where committees expire at the close of a
Congress the cases are placed on the files of
the House and re-referred without any partic-
ular order at the next session of Congress.
Mr. MAYNARD, I suggest that, as next to
doing justice is to give satisfaction—it is some-
times a matter of satisfaction and relieves com-
mittees from the imputation of neglect—the
J ournal shall show that the case was considered
and received a decision.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will state, on
the contrary, that in the ease of one of his own
constituents, which was about to be reported
against, he asked the committee not to make
an adverse report, so that it might be referred
at the next Congress without any adverse report
on the record.
Mr. MAYNARD. That proves conclusively
that there is a contrariety of cases. [Laugh-
ter.]
The SPEAKER. The gentleman withdraws
it, and it is not before the House.
NANCY DUNN.
On motion of Mr. MILLER, the Committee
on Invalid Pensions was discharged from the
consideration of the petition of Mrs. Nancy
Dunn, widow of Richard P. Dunn, late gunner
in the United States Navy; and the same was
referred to the Committee on Revolutionary
Pensions and of the War of 1812.
JANE SI'MUHRAY.
Mr. MILLER. The gentleman who objected
to the bill (S. No. 646) for the relief of Jane
McMurray has withdrawn his objection.
The bill was accordingly considered.
It directs the Secretary of the Interior to pay
