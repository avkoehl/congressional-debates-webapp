HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Chattanooga, May 1, 1864.

General McPHERSON,

Huntsville, Ala.:

Keep me advised as well as possible of the position of your forces on the march. Order all to Rossville. I will try and keep the roads clear for you. I fear we have too much provisions and property at Huntsville. When possible send it forward to Stevenson and Chattanooga. I fear to abandon Decatur left it develop perfectly our move, and your troops from Clifton will soon be up and can probably move from there on Rome in concert with us from this quarter. Therefore hold if possible.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

HUNTSVILLE, May 1, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The three divisions of the Fifteenth Corps are in motion; also the force from Dodge's command. I am expecting Sweeny's division here to-day; also General Dodge's. I shall leave here to-morrow evening.

General McPHERSON,

Huntsville, Ala.:

Dispatch received. All right. The farther east Dodge's command can march the better, for it is going to be a big job for the cars to carry them. If they could possibly reach Stevenson by Wednesday morning it would be a great lift.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

HUNTSVILLE, May 1, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Chattanooga:

General Sweeny's division is here, and leaves to-morrow morning by dirt road. Brigadier-General Veatch will be here to-morrow. The three divisions of the Fifteenth Army Corps are one day's march in advance of their respective starting-points. I had already made arrangements to have provisions, forage, ammunition, &amp;c., stopped at Stevenson instead of coming here, in order that it might be sent on to points where most required. Your instructions that Decatur should not be evacuated, except as a last report, were sent to Brigadier-General Stevenson, who is left in command of the post with 2,500 men.

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General, Commanding.
