Please have the Ninth Illinois send out good road pickets.

Should the enemy be able to comprehend our position, and had he force enough, he might give us annoyance by turning our left by the way of Buford's Bridge.

Very respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

Brigadier General M. F. FORCE,

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: The Major-general commanding directs that instead of moving on this road you will move your entire command on the road the First Brigade is on, and proceed via Whippy Swamp Post-Office to Angley's Post-Office, crossing Whippy Swamp at the latter place and remaining there until you receive orders. The Ninth Illinois Mounted Infantry will move in your advance up to Whippy Swamp Post-Office, when they will leave that road and cross over to this one. Move at 7 o'clock.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

ORDERS.] HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH CORPS,

Near Lawtonville, S. C., February 2, 1865.

This command will march to-morrow toward Duck Branch Post-Office, as follows: The First Division at 6. 30 a.m. ; Third Division at 7. 30 a.m. The immediate presence of the enemy requires that two unencumbered brigades with one battery of Artillery should precede the trains. General Jackson will, therefore, march his two brigades in front of all the trains. General Ward will distribute his troops along the whole train, so as to assist and protect them. A rear guard of two regiments will be sufficient.

The Artillery will march, one battery with the advance brigades, one immediately in rear of the First Division trains, and one with the Third Division.

General Jackson will have as strong a pioneer force as possible at the head of the column.

By command of Bvt. Major General A. S. Williams:

CHAS. MOYER,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
