Captain A.m. VAN DYKE,Assistant Adjutant-General:

One regiment of the First Division has crossed the main stream about 300 yards below the road, and General Mower is now laying a pontoon brigade. The enemy have not yet discovered him, and are still in position. There is a swamp between where he landed and the enemy, which he thinks passable.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE, Near Binnaker's Bridge, February 9, 1865.

Major General F. P. BLAIR,Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The general commanding wishes you to effect a lodgment on the other side of the river by making a detour sufficiently far to your left to turn the enemy's position without loss. He is satisfied that the enemy has nothing but two pieces of artillery, supported by cavalry in small force, and thinks that he may be driven off by persistent and continued efforts, though there is no immediate hurry.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A.m. VAN DYKE,

Assistant Adjtuant-General.

CAPTAIN: General Mower has crossed the river with his entire command, and thinks he is in rear of the enemy, who are supposed to still be in position. I have ordered the Third Division to his support, one brigade to cross and one to remain on this side.

Respectfully,

FRANK P. BLAIR, Jr.,

Major-General.
