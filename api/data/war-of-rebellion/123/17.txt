GENERAL ORDERS, WAR DEPT., ADJT. GENERAL'S OFFICE, Numbers 40. Washington, April 15, 1862.

The Secretary of War has observed, with some surprise, that the commanders of one or two military departments, conceiving themselves empowered to do so, have undertaken to accept the resignations of, and otherwise discharge from the service of the United States, officers commissioned or appointed by the President in the volunteer staff of the Army. All such discharges are irregular, and unless confirmed by the President void of effect. None but the President delegated this power to any general, no general must attempt to exercise it.

By order of the Secretary of War:

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

INDIANAPOLIS, April 15, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Dispatch received. Returns will be made out by adjutant-general and forwarded as soon as possible.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor.

AUGUSTA, April 15, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Circular received. It shall be attended to immediately.

I. WASHBURN, JR.

ANNAPOLIS, April 15, 1862.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Your telegram just received. The returns to this department are not sufficient to enable me to answer with required accuracy your inquiry. I will immediately communicate with some of the commanding officers, and in a day or two be able to give a satisfactory reply.

A. W. BRADFORD.

EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Boston, April 15, 1862.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Circular telegram received. Have ordered adjutant-general of the Commonwealth to prepare reply from statistics in his office.

JNO. A. ANDREW,

Governor.
