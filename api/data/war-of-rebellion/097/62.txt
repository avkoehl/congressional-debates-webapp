WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, D. C., March 21, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

A person in confidential communication with Thompson and Tucker, the rebel agents in Canada, whence he has just arrived, reports that information has been received by them from Richmond to the 11th instant. It had been determined to unite the armies of Lee and Johnston, but at what point was still undecided. It was expected, but not yet absolutely resolved, that Lee's army would leave Richmond for the purpose.

His Excellency A. LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

General Grant would like to see you, and I shall be in Washington to-morrow morning with this vessel (the Bat), in which you can leave in the afternoon. She is a regular armed man-of-war and the fastest vessel on the river. I think it would be best for you to use her.

Only twelve deserters yesterday. Some that came in late last night report that Johnson's and Hetch's divisions were under marching orders, with two days' rations; that it was rumored they were going to North Carolina, the cars being ready on South Side Railroad for them; and our troops were skirmishing within ten miles of Raleigh. I will keep a sharp lookout and advise you the moment I am satisfied of any movement.
