between this place and Martinsburg. I have ordered a detachment of 100 cavalry to be sent to the railroad between Duffield's and Kearneysville to- night. The 150 cavalry will be at Smithfield at the time ordered, but I cannot send out the cavalry to Duffield's to- night. Gilmor was yesterday near Kabletown, and moved toward Smithfield. I feel confident that they intend to attack a train to- night. Please answer.

MAX WEBER,

Brigadier- General.

MARTINSBURG, June 10, 1864.

Brigadier General MAX WEBER, Harper's Ferry:

Send the 100 men to Duffield's. Do you deem your information perfectly reliable! When can you have the 150 cavalry at Smithfield!

Major T. A. MEYSENBURG,

Assistant Adjutant- General, Martinsburg:

I can send 150 cavalry to Smithfield on Sunday, the 12th instant. That leaves me only 50 armed men(mounted) for picket duty. If this expedition stays out five days I will have to use infantry as a guard to the cavalry camp, which consists of 600 unarmed men. My information of the intended raid to- night is from Union men, and I think it is reliable.

MAX WEBER,

Brigadier- General.
