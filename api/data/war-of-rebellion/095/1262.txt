HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, Washington, July 22, 1865.

Corpl. JACOB R. TUCKER,Company G, Fourth Regiment Maryland Volunteer Infantry:

The sum of $460 was sent to me by patriotic citizens to be presented as a reward for gallantry to the soldier who should first raise our flag over Richmond. As Richmond was not taken by assault, I have concluded that the donors' wishes will be best carried out by dividing the sum between three soldiers most conspicuous for gallantry in the final and successful assault on Petersburg.

You have been selected by Major General Charles Griffin, commanding the Fifth Army Corps, as entitled to this honor on behalf of that command, and I herewith present to you $153,33, as one-third of the original sum.

It affords me great satisfaction to receive from your commanding general such unqualified testimony of your gallantry and heroism in battle, and to be the medium of transmitting to you this recognition of the worth of your services in defense of our common country.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
