HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Nashville, November 13, 1862.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Gallatin, Tenn.:

Send brigade at Glasgow to Tompkinsville, with five day's rations always ahead. They will draw their supplies from Bowling Green or Cave City, and when arrived will supply themselves, as far as possible, from the country, giving proper receipt for what they take, crediting the Government, and making regular issues. If they can find horses enough, will mount themselves. Pack-saddles will be forwarded to them for that purpose, on reporting to these headquarters that they have the horses.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Nashville, November 13, 1862-11.30 p.m.

Major-General THOMAS, Gallatin:

Order Rousseau forward to Edgefield Junction, relieving all troops on the road, and clearing out all detachments to their commands. One brigade will be enough for Mitchellsville and Tyree. Not less than three regiments at Mitchellsville, on account of heavy fatigue; one regiment enough at Tyree. Direct the officer at Mitchellsville to lengthen out platform, so that 50 cars be unloaded without delay. Leave one section of artillery at Tyree with regiment.

By command of Major-General Rosecrans:

ARTHUR C DUCAT,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Acting Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Nashville, November 13, 1862.

Major-General THOMAS, Gallatin:

Send one regiment of infantry and one section of artillery to Colonel Kennett, at Hartsville. Is the Michigan regiment you want Colonel Innes', and what is its number? Cavalry will be sent to you as soon as practicable. Cannot spare cavalry from Kennett now, as he to send one regiment to Crittenden.

By command of Major-General Rosecrans:

ARTHUR C. DUCAT,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Acting Chief of Staff.

GALLATIN, November 13, 1862.

General ROSECRANS:

Have no been able to see Mr. Anderson yet. Went to the tunnel this morning; northern tunnel clear; south tunnel, General Steedman thinks, can be cleared in eight days with a force of 500 men. I directed him to put the men on at once, which will be done to-morrow. How long will Crittenden remain at Silver Springs?

GEO. H THOMAS,

Major-General.
