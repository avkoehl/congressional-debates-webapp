GENERAL: The enemy advanced from Decatur to Courtland yesterday. Left this morning on Moulton road-a raid somewhere. The force they had at Courtland was four pretty large regiments infantry, three cavalry regiments. I send some papers; refer you to orders in the Nashville paper of the 17th of General Milroy, at the head of the

last column, first page. Please give me a general order for scouting, &amp;c.

I am just starting in pursuit of enemy.

JULY 28, 1864-12 m.

Major-General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: I have with me parts of four regiments, numbering in all about 500 men. I have left on picket on the left four regiments and parts of other regiments. By General Jackson's order I left my pickets, to be relieved by him to-day, when they could rejoin their commands. I send General Jackson's order,* in virtue of which I moved, for the purpose of showing you why the command with me is so small.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

W. Y. C. HUMES,

Brigadier-General.

MAJOR: Your dispatch of 10.10 a. m. just received. I have halted my command on the McDonough road, three miles from Doctor Avery's where it will await orders.

Respectfully, &c.,

W. Y. C. HUMES,

Brigadier-General.

Major E. S. BURFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Wheeler's Corps:

MAJOR: I have just received the inclosed note* from Colonel Harrison, in reply to which I have ordered him to move at once to this point with the rest of my division, regardless of any orders he may receive from General Jackson. I also send Jackson's orders,* by virtue of which I moved, which I intended but failed to send by last courier.

Respectfully, &c.,

W. Y. C. HUMES,
