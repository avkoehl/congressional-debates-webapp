they think they are, and many others Urn k with j

How then are theae States to be induced to re '
scmd or repeal these laws' Suppose the United ¡
States to aopiy to them for the repeal—they will j
answer, their laws are approved by their people, (
they had the power to enact them, and they wnl
not repeal lliern What, then' Are the United
States to nppiy forte 10 compel the repeal' if I
they do, unti «.uch force is met by an opposing ,
force from the States,, we then have presented to I
our views the most horrid of all spectacles Armed i
strife between brothers, and, in the midst of it, ¡
wnat becomes of the red men for whose r.ghts
this war is waged' 1 hey ure swept from this ■
B.ate of existence When the war terminates, ,
there will be no Indians to be protected by the '
United States, or by these States individually        j
The time has arrived when we must all speak
out plainly as vie think.    These people, if tney |
remain where they are, must submit to the laws
of the respective S ates     Tney cannot exist in j
the States as a v¡ ara'e aid distinct community, I
governed by their oic  customs and laws     Some
of them are civilized and enlightened, they vwil
make useful mid rehpectable membersof any com-
munity     They muy still remain wiiere they are,
it they choose     But this is not the cordition of
the cLss ot   the  Indian population      I hey aie
poor, ignorant, and uninformed                                 '
Res ding where they now do, certain m.sery

t! e Mississii pi, out of our fatales and organised
Territories, they may be preserved     There they
mav progress in that civil zation wl ich has com
roenced, they can, as lieemen, have a goveri raent
of t'ieír own choice, their interests can^be pro-
moted, and tneir righis protected by tiie United j
State*, witnoui collision with any State     Who
now doubi3 that it i  their interest to do so'   Tew |
men can doubt it, who will take pains to acquire
correct information, and then duly consider the
subject     1 bel.eve the time has nearly arrived, '
aro. will certainly soon have arrived, when there I
will be but one opinion upon this subject through- |

it was the pol.cy of -Mr Jeflerson it has been

Mr   BEN ION said, he rose, not to prolong |
this discussion, but to bring in a voice much more
potential than his own    It was tne voice of Mr  I
Jefferson, by which it v/ould be seen that these I
things whicn we called treaties, were not so under |
the Uonsti'ution ot the United States, nor were ,
they treaties upon which the laws of the United
States were founded   Such was the ground taken i
by President Washington     The word treaty in
the Constitution was to be there undei stood as it j
is recognised in the laws of nations, and nothing i
else but that kind of treaty w'iidi was known to I
the laws of nations    And fast, it was to be made
with a foreign Power, and while an Indian might
be deceived, and suppose that this th ng which we
called a treaty, was what was understood and con-
templated by tne Constitution of the United States,
yet no statesman should take so shallow a view of
it    Look at the treaties made witn some of these
people who had not a blanket round their shoulders,
and then say whether they are such things as can
put down the laws of asovereign State    A judge
would have widely mistaken his duty who should
say that such a proceeding could put down the
muncipat íegulations of a sovereign State    (Mr
B reauan extract fiom a work of Mr JeiTerson's,
to show to what subjects the treaty making power ||
extended )    He said he rosefoi the mere purpose il
of bringing Mr JeiTerson's voice where it would |
be heard     lie wished the Cherokees well and '
comfortably located west of the Mississippi, where |
they would find a safe home, and he wished them .
also to  be fuily informed  that these were not ¡I
treaties which could operate against a sovereign :
State                                                                              |
Mr CLA\ losetoassure the honorable Senator '
from Georgia [Mr Clthbert] he had no inten-
tion of making a show, but that the honorable ,
Senator r igl t take the charge to himself, since he
[Mi   Cothbert] had declarea he had no object
in view, that Georgia did not plead here     With I
regard to the objections of the honorable Senator
from Tennessee [Mr White] he would say a few  I
words     Mr   C  went on  to "how the validity of
treaties, and the obligation of the United States
to fulfil all tnat these treaties guaiantied    The
Senator recoiled at the thought of a civil war,
where the Indians would be swept from the face A
of the earth     How was it last session when the I1
powers of a State were actually arrayed against |
the General Government >   He gave a warm sup- !
poit to the measures then adopted     He himself '
gave a reiudant vote in its favor     It filled him i
with the severest feelings of sorrow then, he had j
reflected upon it with grief ever since     The re
moval of the Indians was said to have been the
I  policy of former Administrations, but it was rot
to be done by foice of arms, he knew they would
all melt away in the midst of civilized society, he
wished they would all emigrate to a ¡and where
they mi"ht be beyond the reach and influence of
the white man     He believed that Noith Caiolma
had not touched them, Tenness.ee had interfered
on'y to protect them against the whites   One State
only had gone to externes    Georgia had out
I   snipped all the rest
Mr    CLIIIBERT  replied  in  a few  words   i
|  The question (said he) is one due to humanity,
and upon this giound he was willing to go with
the ge! ciernan  butt> talk of negotiations in regard
'   to the rights of the State was mockeiy
The memon-i and resolutions were then reteired ¡
