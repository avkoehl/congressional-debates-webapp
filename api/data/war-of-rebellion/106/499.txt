JOSEPH F. BENNETT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CARSON CITY, June 28, 1863.

To His Excellency Governor ORION CLEMENS,

Nevada Territory:

SIR: I find it an impossibility to recruit an infantry company in this Territory. I have now tried it for four weeks, at a personal expense of over $200, and as yet have to get a man. Parties that I am acquainted with are willing to join my company and furnish their own horses, and, if need be, to furnish one or two extra for others that cannot furnish one for themselves, and I am confident that if my company was changed from an infantry to a cavalry one that I could be mustered into service inside of thirty days. I am well liked by the community at large, and a great many men are willing to give up good claims, or place them in the hands of other parties, to go with me a as a cavalry captain. If it is possible for you to change my company from an infantry to a cavalry one, you will, I think, confer a favor upon our mutual cause. By taking some immediate action upon this matter you will greatly oblige,

Yours, respectfully,

J. J. CLOSE,

Captain Company A, First Infantry Nevada Territory Volunteers.
