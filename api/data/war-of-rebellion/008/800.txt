Colonel THOMAS JORDAN, Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I first came here on the 25th ultimo, returned to Columbus on the night of the 26th, and was back on the 27th. These dates are from memory. My papers are with the fleet below Tiptonville.

On the 1st of March the enemy appeared on Madrid plain and drove in our scouts. On the 2nd March a skirmish occurred with 1 mile of New Madrid. New Madrid was evacuated on the night of the 14th instant. The gunboats appeared above us on the 15th and have been in range of us ever since.

The boats Island 10 at 10 o'clock at night after the repulse fo the gunboats on the 17th. I arrived at the fleet on my return from Fort Pillow on the evening of the 20th, landed below Riddle's Point, on Tennessee shore, and made my way here on the 21st.

On my first arrival here five guns were mounted in Battery Numbers 1 and seven in Battery Numbers 5 on main shore. No guns were mounted on the island. When I left for Fort Pillow four guns were mounted on the main shore, protected by parapet of earth, and nineteen guns on the island, also protected (earthworks). A redoubt is being about finished to protect the batteries on main shore.

I send inclosed a report of Captain Gray, engineer. On my arrival at Island 10, Colonel Kennedy reported to me less than 300 negroes, and tools not sufficient to work them.

The redoubt was laid off and under construction when I left for Pillow. The batteries were nearly complete.

Respectfully submitted.

J. P. McCOWN,Major-General, Commanding.
