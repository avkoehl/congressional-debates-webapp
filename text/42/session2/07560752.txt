THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 31,
upon individual deposits. It would be prac-
ticable for the banks to calculate with refer-
ence to this fund that it must be at rest for
three months. Then the Secretary is justified
in leaving the money, and he is besides jus-
tified in taking advantage of the profit that
shall accrue to the Government. It is neces-
sary that the money should remain in the
national banks; it is unavoidable that it should
remain there; and the Secretary has been
shrewd and wise ia taking advantage of that
necessity.
The gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Beck]
and the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Kerb]
base much of their criticism on the alleged feet
that money remains on deposit longer than for
three months. The Treasury is not to blame
for that. The Secretary can do nothing with
the sum of $14,000,000 sacredly pledged for
the redemption of the five-twentiea called in
September 1, and on which interest ceased
December 1, but not yet presented. The
money must await the demand of the holders
of the bonds. The national banks may derive
profit from the deposit, the Government loses
nothing, and .the fund cannot be more secure
than it now is, guarantied by ample deposits
of national bonds.
Mr. Speaker, the resolution before the House
only declares that in this action the Secretary
of the Treasury has violated no law. I do not
choose to follow gentlemen on the other side
in their extraordinary assaults upon the stat-
utes as they stand, nor in their propositions
for new legislation. When new legislation
comes np in its order we may consider it and
act upon it fairly. The question now is, was
this action of the Secretary right under the
law? Did his action violate the law? If
it is the object, of gentlemen to put a strait-
jacket upon the Treasury they should cer-
tainly pass a resolution like this. If they
believe that the Secretary has violated the
law in issuing new bonds for the redemption
of the five-twenties, then it is practicable for
the House to say that no more refunding shall
take place under the law as it now stands.
Gentlemen on the other side are able to tell
you how much the syndicate makes out, of this
transaction; I do not know; very little do I
care, lint 1 do know what the country makes.
Here isa negotiation of $200,000,000 of bonds
at a lower rate of interest., to run for ten
years. Without compounding intetest, there
is a saving to the country upon the negotia-
tion of §10,000,000. Compounding the inter-
est it is a saving of $20,800,000 Cor ten years,
or of $75,000,000 for twenty years. This
amount is actually saved. It is not merely
postponed to t.he distant future. It. not so
much taken by taxation from the hard earn-
ings or scant savings of our people. It, is in
so far a permanent, relief from taxation, it
is a blessing which no theory assails; which
no class can question.
! am not prepared to say, and this House is
not now called upon to say, whether the Secre-
tary ought to nmke a new negotiation with the
syndicate. The House ought to say that with
the laws as they stand the Secretary shall be
open to receive proposals, The Secretary
has not been "hawking our bonds about in
Europe," as the gentleman from New York
[Mr. Cox] suggests, Here is an offer that is
brought to his door, a new offer for $000,000,-
000, with a saving of interest of §7,500,000
a year, or $75,000,000 in ten .years. 1 do not
feel ready to say that he ought to accept any
such offer ; but I do feel proud to say that this
Administration has lifted the country to a
point where such an offer is brought to it
Irom Europe.
I was very glad to hear the words of my col-
league from New York oity [Mr. Bkooks] tes-
tifying to the increased strength of the credit
of the United States abroad. One of the evi-
dences (and it is an evidence that cannot be
gainsaid j of the increased strength of our credit
is the very negotiation to which this resolu-
tion refers. Let me call attention to the fact
besides, that this Government never before
negotiated a loan at such rates as those at
which this has been negotiated. It has always
paid one per cent, for commissions. During
the war the purchaser of our bonds had always
the advantage of the premium on gold. Going
back to 1860, under Mr, Buchanan's adminis-
tration, the Government, trying to borrow
$5,000,000, was compelled to accept a dis-
count of ten and five-eighths per cent. This is
not peculiar to our Government. I hold in my
hand a table of negotiations of loans abroad,
running through a number of years, showing
that various Governments have made great
loans, always allowing very heavy discounts.
Observe particularly now the loan of France
for £40,000,000 sterling at 80, equal to twenty
per cent, discount, and that was a five per cent,
loan ; a loan of Austria in 1865 for £15,000,000
sterling at 70; and that was a five per cent,
loan. And Austria tried in 1856 to borrow
$6,000,000, and failed. And these rates run all
the way down, Turkey borrowing £8,516,363
sterling at 47J,a discount of fifty-two and a half
per cent. ; and that was a five per cent. loan.
While this is true, these Governments have
paid besides a commission of two and two and
a half per cent, to bankers, and never less than
two per cent. That, is now the current rate in
England and on the Continent, and public loans
are not made without the payment of these
commissions. The table is made up with care
and is appended:

Mr. Speaker, the question is not whether
we shall continue to pay any particular rate
of interest; the question is whether or not the
Secretary up to this time has violated the law;
not even whether this negotiation was for the
advantage of the country. If it ware only to
prove the strength of the national credit, I for
one am glad the negotiation was made. We
have heard on this floor claims that we can
borrow money now at four per cent. Let us
borrow money as low as we can; but let us
always sustain fair negotiations, openly made
in accordance with the letter of the law.
.So American credit rises. Attacks have been
made upon it before the gentleman from
New York [Mr. Wood] to-day sneered at "our
bankrupt bonds." These attacks have taken
all forms during the last ten years. Out of
the great war our brave soldiers came home
exhausted by burden and effort, shattered and
crippled by rebel shots. So, too, came the
national credit, staggering, exhausted, crippled
from the great conflict. No healing is possi-
ble for many of our boys in blue; but our
credit comes from the very gates of the grave,
restored, lusty, and stalwart, and advances con-
quering and to conquer. Hamilton "smote
the rock of the national resources and abun-
dant streams of revenue gushed forth ; he
touched the dead corpse of public credit, and it
sprang to its feet." The achievement of Ham-
ilton lias been more than repeated. Belittle
them as we may, the financial triumphs of the
Government-in the past few years have been
a wonder and a blessing.
Criticism upon these negotiations has some-
times been patriotic. It has been in many
cases a part of the war of which the debt is a
consequence. Capital is timid and suspicious ;
yet it responds to the growing credit of the
country and rebukes assaults upon it. It
makes haste everywhere to pay tribute to the
marvelous progress of the Republic and the
success of the Administration. No law has
been broken to achieve this result. No arts of
magic have been used to draw foreign capital,
to raise the price of national securities. Our
credit is no fabric of fancy, no creation of in-
genuity ; it is a natural growth. Its roots
strike deep in the rich soil, between seams of
gold and veins of iron and precious metals,
its trunk is nurtured by southern suns and
stiffened by northern winds. It spreads out
its branches wide and comely over busy and
productive millions. Dews fall and days pass,
and it increases. It is vital and it is en-
during. Strike at it; it still grows. It bears
good fruit. Let, us not by false reading of laws
girdle the oak of our credit. Give it only a
fair chance. Give it the husbandry of com-
mon sense, and all will go well. We may bor-
row at four per cent, or three percent. Let
us say the Secretary of the Treasury has acted
in accordance with the law in what he has
done, and for the future see if we can do
better.
Mr. KERR. Mr. Speaker, I desire, on be-
half of the minority of the committee, to offer
the following substitute for the resolution of
the majority, so it maybe pending to-morrow.
Mr. DAWES. It will not be pending.
Mr. KERR. Why?
Mr. DAWES. Because it is not in order.
The SPEAKER. The pending motion is to
recommit.
Mr. KERR. I ask that the resolution may
be read, as the expression of our views.
The Clerk read as follows:
lieiohed, That in the opinion of the House the
Secretary of the Treasury, in negotiating the loan
authorized by the act of July 14,1870, has increased
the bonded debt more than was necessary or proper,
and has incurred expenditures contrary to law.
Mr. MAYNARD. I desire to say I must
object if this will give the gentleman from
Indiana [Mr. Kerb] another opportunity of
being heard on this same question.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts [Mr. Dawes] is recognized as hold-
ing the floor.; and the resolution of the gentle-
man from Indiana has only been read for
information.
Mr. KERR, I will inquire why my substi-
tute is not in order ?
