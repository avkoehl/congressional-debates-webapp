BOLIVAR, July 27, 1862.

General McCLERNAND:

My infantry force has just returned safe, but were in sight of 300 cavalry, who kept at a respectful distance. My information as to the infantry at La Grange, to the cavalry, and as to six pieces of artillery is reliable; they were counted. I don't think they will attack us to-day. They say that we escaped them at La Grange and Grand Junction, but they will capture us here if it takes the Army of the Southwest. At present we don't propose being taken.

ROSS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

BOLIVAR, July 27, 1862.

General McCLERNAND:

Most of the cavalry west of us are reported to be moving northwest, toward Estanaula. I am now sending out additional scouting parties.

ROSS.

JACKSON, July 27, 1862.

Captain DOLLINS, Bolivar:

You will advance toward Toone's Station to meet Major Stewart, who is moving on the Bolivar road to meet you somewhere about the mouth of Clover Creek. You had better manage to meet him at some point. You can send couriers to cause him to come to Toone's Station.

JOHN A. LOGAN,

Brigadier-General.

Major Stewart will understand that I am consenting to the above order.

JOHN A. McCLERNAND.

BOLIVAR, July 27, 1862.

General McCLERNAND:

Dollins has just sent a messenger stating that he tried to capture and destroy the ferry-boat at Estanaula, but was driven back this morning. My forces had not joined him, but were near him. He wants infantry re-enforcements, and says he will whip them before he leaves there.

I can't spare any of my forces.

ROSS.

BOLIVAR, July 27, 1862.

General McCLERNAND:

I misunderstood Dollins' messenger. The facts are as follows:

The ferry-boats at Brownsville, Estanaula, and at the steam-mill ferry are destroyed. Dollins' skirmish took place at the ferry known as Lower Post, only 5 miles from Toone's Station.

ROSS.
