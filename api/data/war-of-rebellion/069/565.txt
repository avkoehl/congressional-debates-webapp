FLAG-SHIP AGAWAM, Farrar's Island, June 3, 1864-12.45 p. m.

Honorable GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy:

From six to a dozen steam-barges, which I suppose may be easily obtained in the Northern cities, will be of great advantage to me here, if torpedo fitted, and rifle-screens enough to protect its few apertures. I respectfully request the favorable consideration of the Department to this subject.

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral.

FLAG-SHIP AGAWAM, Farrar's Island, June 3, 1864-10 p. m.

Honorable GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy:

Captain Smith reports the failure of a gallant attempt to blow up the ram Albermarle, and information from deserters that the Neuse is afloat and ready for service. I hope the Chickopee been sent to the sounds. I will immediately dispatch the Otsego there, through much needed to keep open army and navy communication on this river. I will order the Sassacus up here in her stead.

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral.
HEADQUARTERS, In the Field, June 3, 1864-1.30 p. m.

Rear-Admiral LEE,Commanding, &amp;c.:

SIR: I beg leave to assure you in writing, as I have heretofore verbally, that the obstructions furnished you by me will in no way be any charge or cost to the Navy Department, unless it chooses voluntarily to assume the expense. I have neither doubt nor hesitation upon the subject. If the expenditure of the few thousands for these vessels will save one monitor from torpedoes or fire-raft, or the lives of 10 men I have sent to the navy, I should make it at once. You will judge of the efficiency of the obstructions. The expense has already been assumed by the army, although I cannot appreciate the difference. One treasury, one nation, one cause-all is served alike, if one is served.

Respectfully,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
