only hostile Indians, as it seems, from whom anything is to be apprehended on the Minnesota [frontier] are the small bands under Sleepy Eyes, White Lodge, &amp;c., and any raids they can make before winter must of necessity be small affairs. Colonel Thomas is ordered in returning to Minnesota to march against any hostile Indians whom he may hear of anywhere south of Devil's Lake. I have also sent orders to Sully to send over to you Brackett's battalion, and I send to-morrow the other two companies of the First U. S. Volunteers. With all these forces it would seem that the frontier of Minnesota ought to be safe. I send these forces in deference to your apprehensions, though I cannot bring myself to believe that there can be any danger, except from small raids, which the forces in your district ought to be abundantly able to manage.

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

MILWAUKEE, September 30, 1864.

Brigadier General A. SULLY,

Fort Rice, Dak. Ter.:

If you do not need Brackett's battalion this winter send them across the country to Minnesota.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General.
