SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

August 13, 1863.

General GRANT:

I ordered General Dennis,some days ago,to send in all the loose cotton about the bridge,and will renew the order. There is no Confederate cotton hereabouts. We could get plenty of cotton by opening a store to barter for it. The people east of the Big Black have all more less private cotton that they want to exchange for shoes and groceries. Farrar's regiment will come to Vicksburg in the 4 p.m. train.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

MEMPHIS, August 13, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Winchester, Tenn.:

Arkansas has been added to my command,and all my spare force is devoted to that region. If you will send a mounted command say 3,000 with light artillery,down the Tennessee to Bear Creek, I will unite 2,000 cavalry with them and drive Johnston's right wing in on the Upper Tombigbee. This will stampede him back to the Coosa and clear your right flank. The mountains of North Alabama are full of deserters with arms,who can be enrolled for us by this move.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
