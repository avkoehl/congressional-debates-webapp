Just received the following:

MARIETTA AND DALLAS ROAD,

October 4, 1864.

General VANDEVER:

I found the enemy occupying our line of works to the railroad in more force than dismounted cavalry dislodge them from. I cover the Dallas road. All my information leads me to believe that there is a large force of infantry with cavalry. Please communicate this to Generals Stanley and Sherman.

I have ordered my command to be ready to march at dayLight, and will go in the direction of Lost Mountain to Allatoona, although, if Hardee should be where he is represent to be, I will not be able to make much progress in that direction. Please communicate this to General Sherman; I have done so to General Stanley.
