HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS,February 11, 1865. (Received 8.15 p. m.)

[General WARREN:]

GENERAL: The pickets belonging to Bragg's brigade were relieved shortly after soon to-day. All detailed men in the quartermaster and commissary departments will be at once relieved and sent under an officer to Warren's Station by 11 o'clock to-morrow. I sent an officer at once to communicate with army headquarters. He has returned this evening with the statement that General Ingalls has been directed not to forward this brigade until the detached men return, and as Bragg has considerably over the number required, tow regiments have been directed to be returned, namely, the Sixth Wisconsin and Seventh Wisconsin. I have telegraphed Colonel Ruggles that I have many regiments better fitted for service out of this army than the Twenty-fourth Michigan, and have asked that I be allowed to supplant it by another, so as to retain my Western regiments. They wish to remain. I hope you will second my efforts.

Respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brevet Major-General.

P. S.-All detained men from pioneers, provost guard, and sharpshooters are en route for Warren's Station.

Brigadier-General BRAGG:

(Care General Ingalls, City Point.)

It is not intended you should take over 1,200 men. If you have more send back a regiment or more to cover the surplus. As you brigade may not return, your recruits and detached men from regiments must proceed with you. Generals Warren and Crawford have been so informed.

By command of Major-General Meade:

GEO. D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
