THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

examine and report its merits' Were not the ob-
jects whom it seeks to benefit worthy of the kind-
ness and consideration of the House' Had they
not shed their blood, periled then lives, and fought
the battles of their country ?
But it is objected by the gentleman from Rhode
Island [Mr Birges] thatthe wais in which they
were engaged were pnvale wars, that they were
waged for the defence ot individual rights and
property. Can this be so' inquired Mr P. Look
(said he) to western history, and see if the fallacy
of the assertion is not stamped upon every page.
Look to general history, and it will be found that
at tne close of the revolutionary war, when the
Atlantic States were enjoying the blessings of
"profound peace and undisturbed repose," when
the last cannon's roar had died away upon the
breeze; when the shrill notes of the fife had been
succeeded by (he busy hum of revived and awa-
kened occupation, when the instruments of death
were laid aside for those of more peaceful voca-
tion, did the people of the West enjoy the same
happy state ot things' Did they bask in the same
sunshine' Or were their midnight forests still
lighted with the flames of continued war, and the
very air loaded with the sci earns of murdeiedand
mangled victims'
But how (said Mr P ) were these private wars '
Of what character were the campaigns under Har-
din, and Harmar, and Clark—the great Clark, who
has been justly styled the Hannibal of the West'
Of what character was the campaign under the
unfortunate St Clair' Weie these conducted to
carry on private wars, or predatory wars, to pro-
tectmátticÍMaingbtsandpioperty' Certainly not.
The rich blood that flowed in torrents at St Clair's
defeat, flowed not in apíñate but in ¡xpublic war
St Clair did not head a self-constituted band, con-
giegated for the purposes of plunder, or the nros-
ecution of a private feud, but he commanded an
army under the direction and control of tne Gov-
ernment of the United States, fiom which author-
ity he derived his commission of command, and
to which he was amenable for his conduct Mr.
P repeated that it was a public wai, and, in sup
port of that view, referred to the resolution of
Congress of the 21st July, 1787, directing " tne
' Secretary of War to place the trooos of the Uni-
'tel States in such positions as should affoid the
' must effectual protection to the frontier mbab-
' itants of Pennsylvania and Virginia fiom the
' incursions and depredations of the Indians, for
'preventing intrusions on the Federal lands, and
' promoting a favorable issue to the intended
' treaty " He also refened to another resolution
of the same body, requesting the Executive oí Vir-
ginia " to give ordeis to the militia in the district
' of Kentucky to hold themselves in readiness to
' unite with the Federal troops in such operations
' as the officer commanding them might judge
■ necessary for the protection of the frontiers, and
' that, on the application of the commanding offi-
' cer of the Federal troops, the said Exeeufve be
' requested to give oiders that a part of said rm-
'litia, not exceeding one thousand, be embodied
'and take such positions as the said commanding
' officer should direct for acting in conjunction
•with the Federal troops in protecting and defend-
1 mg the frontier inhabitants, «main making such
' expeditions against the Indians, m case they con-
' tinued hostil-, as Congress should thereafter oider
•and direct."
These resolutions, continued Mr P ,incontest-
ably establish the fact that the Federal Govern-
ment looked upon these wars as national in their
character, and betray an anx ety on the paitof the
public functionaries of that day to bring them to a
speedy termination Yet, in despite of this testi-
mony to the contrsry, it is no w gravely contended
that they were pnvate wais Certainly this as-
sertion cannot be predicated on the fact that the
western country happened to be the exclus.ve
theatres of the shocking butcheiies that occuued.
Because in that view of the ca«e, Kentucky and
Tennessee, and other States, might wall equal pro-
priety contend thatthe late wai was a private wai,
it not having been waged within the r terntoiial
limits But, sir, they d d notassume that ground
The people of those States were animated with the
same hopes and fears that were íelt by the patriots
of other States     They mouined over theieveises
and rejoiced at the successes of their country; and
their swords were ready then, as they ever will
be, " to leap from their scabbards " at the call oi
duty
It has been well remarked (said Mr. P ) by one
of my colleagues [Mr. Hardin] that the wars
spoken of were a continuation of the revolutionary
war If this be so, said he, the question is at an
end He proposed briefly to examine that point,
and desired it to be borne in mind that when the
revolutionary war commenced we were at peace
with every tube of Indians, that the British Gov-
ernment adopted the cruel policy of stimulating the
savages to confederate with her troops in the war,
and to imbrue their hands in our blood, that that
Governmentliteiallybargainedm Ameucan blood,
and traffi ked in American scalps losuchamui-
derous extent was this horrible policy pursued,
that it roused the matchless Chatham to one of the
noblest tifotls of his life, and induced him to pour
out his indignant feelings in strains of fervid elo
quence unpaialleled in the efforts of the times.
When peace ensued what was the course (inquired
Mr P ) pursued by the British Government' Did
that Government surrender the posts on the lakes,
or did it retain them, in open violation of the treaty
concluded between the two nations' It not only
retained them, said he, but its agents actually sup
plied the savages from thence with all munitions
necessary to continue the war and harass us with
their butcheries and depredations The savages
did continue the war, and it was from these very
posts that the victors of the unfortunate St Clair
and his army deiived their implements of destitu-
tion In the face, then, of all these facts, asserted
by history and corroboiated by the concurring tes-
timony of the suruvois of tne scenes that occui-
red, how can it be asseited that these were private
wars, or predatory wars' How can it be doubted
that they weie a condnuation of the revolutionary
war ' It is true (said Mr P ) there wab aim Men
treaty of peace, but it is equal y true there wa") no
peace It is true there wau an avowed ard stipu
lated suspension of hostih ies,outit is equally true
that the British Goxernment prolonged the war
thiough tne means and agency of the savages
The glad tidings of peace had officially gone forth,
but still muider and rapine reigned with unmiti-
gated fury Mr P considered there was no peace
until the actual suspension of all hostilities, until
the allies and confederates of the Bntish Govern-
ment had ceased to brandish the infernal toma-
hawk, and until the militaiy posts alluded to were
actually sunendered by the British Government
into the hands of that of the United States H«
dismissed this part of the subject by the avowal of
an opinion that every drop of patriot blood that
was spilt in those wars, evecy sold'er that was
slam, every scalp that was taken, nod every victim
that was butchered, was all done in a common
cause, for the common defence, and dunng the
continuance of the war o<" the Revo'ution
Mr P next proceeded to novice the objection
taken to the pension system by the gentleman
fiom Virginia, [Mr Box i. m 1 He was opposed
to the amendment offeied by that honorable gen-
tleman He could not a°ree that the tendency of
pensions was demoralizing In this particulai
case, it could not generate the spirit of idleness
which the gentleman from Virginia so earnestly
deprecated, because the objects to be pensioned
had already reached an age when their habits, good
or bad, were fixed They were now in the " sere
and yellow leaf," and their habits were immuta-
ble It had been also stated in debate that the
pension system was of demoralizing tendency,
inasmuch as it held out inducements to perjury
Mr P did not think this a sound objection It
was an ob]ection that would apply with equal force
to the laws and judicial pioceedmgs of every State
in the Union In many, or all the States, a man
seeking the collection of a debt, or the enforcement
of a claim,is allowed to swear to the statements of
his bill or affidavit Assuredly there is as great
temptation to perjury held out in this practice as
in the pension laws The system (said Mr. P )
is like everything el e of human contrivance, liable
to be abused But suiely, said he, the possibi'ity
of such an oecuirence can constitute no legitimate
objection to ti e system itself Let us dischatge
our duty Let us discharge a long-existing debt
of gratitude.    And if any unworthy citizen in
seeking to obtain that to which he is not entitled,
shall forswear himself, let us leave him to abide
the judgment of his own conscience and that of his
Maker So far from objecting to the system, Mr.
P was its advocate He was so because he
believed all its tendencies were good; he believed
it calculated to nerve the warrior's arm in the
hour of battle, to stimulate him to deeds of nobler
daring, to inducehim to leap, with a lion's bound,
into the storm of the conflict, convinced of the
justice and beneficence of his Government, and of
its protection and support of those whom his pos-
sible death in the struggle would leave unsheltered
and forlorn.
Mr P. said he had deemed it his duty thus feebly
to raise his humble voice in support of the resolu-
tion offered by his worthy friend and colleague,
[Mr Chilton,] a resolution which embraces within
its provisions a remnant of a race of men, many
of whom still IingT in the district he had the honor
to represent in Confess—a race of men whose
hands, he thanked Heaven, were unstained with
plunder, who were revered where they were best
known for their virtues and their valor, who were
ardently attached to the honor and glory of their
country, and whose last breath,Jie doubted not,
woufd be expendedm invoking font the blessings
and protection of their God.
Mr BOULDIN rose to address the Chair, and,
at the same moment, rose Mr CROCKETT.
The CHAIR, decided that  the  member from
Tennessee [Mr   Crockett] was entitled to the
i floor, inasmuch as the member from Virginia had
sooken already on this question.
Mr CROCKETT said he had usen not to make
a miscellaneous speech. There had been too many
speeches of that sort already. He rose to move
the previous question
The Chair decided that the previous question
was not in order at present, as. the gentleman from
Virginia would be entitled to the floor after the
gentleman from Tennessee had yielded it.
Mr   CROCKETT     We'I, sir, I will make a
little short speech   His well known to this House
and to the nation (he said) that he had always
suppoited the pension svstem     He had always
contended that the volunteers and militiamen were
| even better entitled to pensions than the regular
! troops    The regulars sell themselves to the Gov-
I eminent for a fixed price, but the volunteer goes
I into the war for the love of his country     fie had
| no doubt that the Indian fighters were as much
I emuled to the bounty of the Government as any
I of the soldiers of the Revolution     There was no
question that they suffered as much as any men
who engaged in any other sei vice    They suffered
as much by the scalping knife and from the want
of provisions     Fie had been accustomed to that
soit of thing, and had taken a hand m it himself.
[I is object was to move the previous question, and
if it was not in oider now, he hoped it would be
when the gen'leman from Virginia had spoken.
He had now finished his speech
Mr  BOULDIN rose to speak, but
The CHAIR reminded Mi B that but a few
minutes remained before the expiration of the
hour.
Mr ADAMS, of Massachusetts, had but a few
words to say, winch, with theleaveof the gentle-
man in possession of the floor, he would say now.
If the pension system was inconsistent with good
policy, it ouj'it to be abandoned and something
I else substituted    But as the system was in exist-
| enoe, he had nothing to say on that point     The
I inquiry proposed by the resolution as to the pro-
priety of pensioning thepersons who were engaged
in the Indian wars pnoi to 1794, was not, in his
opinion, liable to a single objection
Against the object of the inquiry he had met
with but one objection, and that was, that the In-
dian wars which took place within the period men-
tioned were private wars Sir, I believe this opin-
ion is not well founded He believed they were
not private wais, and that they wereasmach pub-
lic as the wai with Great Britain during the Revo-
lution, or the late war with Great Britain The
conclusion of peace in 1783 left us still at war with
the Indian tribes He held in his hand the journals
of the Congiess of the old Confederation, from
which it appeared that in 1784 it was proposed to
disband the United States Army A report was
made m relation to Indian affairs, showing that the
