regiments first saw service in the field after the battle of Spotsylvania. At Cold Harbor the colonel of the Thirty-sixth Wisconsin, as gallant a soldier as ever lived, fell dead on the field, as did the colonel of the Eighth New York fell mortally wounded beside his flag on the breast-works of the enemy. These regiments have since that action suffered severely, one of them at least having lost two commanding officer. I respectfully request that their colors may be returned to them. They are entitled to the same privileges as other regiments-that is, the right to strive to avoid the penalties of General Orders, No. 37, current series, headquarters Army of the Potomac.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers.

There is quite sharp musketry on the left as Fort Hell-interspersed with artillery. The musketry seems too heavy for picket. It sounds like an attack on the picket-line.
