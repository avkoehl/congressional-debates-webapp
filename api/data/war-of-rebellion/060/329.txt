At 8 p. m. I directed a scouting party from the First [West] Virginia Cavalry at North Mountain to go via Mill's Gap to Bloomery at once. My men and horses are not in good condition. The Eighth and First Virginia and Ewing's battery have not arrived.

If you will order General Wheaton's command to this point I shall feel secure and will soon be able to assume the offensive.

Brigadier-General AVERELL,

Martinsburg:

General Wheaton with five regiments was ordered from Washington to Harper's Ferry. A portion, I learn, have already arrived. I will go to Martinsburg and the Ferry as soon as I can safely leave here. If Imboden and Gilmor are coming up this way I do not wish to be far away.

CUMBERLAND, January 2, 1864 - 5 p. m.

Brigadier-General AVERELL,

Martinsburg:

Send a scout to-morrow morning via Mill's Gap, Shanghai, and Unger's Store to Bloomery, and ascertain of there is any truth in the report if Imboden coming up this way.

HEADQUARTERS FOURTH DIVISION,Martinsburg, January 2, 1864.

Brigadier-General KELLEY,

Cumberland:

I have but very few horses able to go to Winchester. Infantry can move faster than cavalry, and farther during this weather, and I should prefer to send my men on foot, those who have shoes and are able to walk. Fitz. Lee's horses must be in miserable condition, as it has taken since Wednesday last to reach Petersburg from Mount Jackson. Cannot the Tenth [West] Virginia, by a forced march over the Seneca route via Franklin, reach the South Fork before Lee's return? They should send scouts ahead to ascertain what his route may be. I do not believe that the enemy can move Thoburn if he has enough ammunition. It is impossible, I believe, to cut Lee off from this point with my command in its present condition. A movement of infantry to Mount Jackson beyond would stand some chance of harassing him. I will send forward my available cavalry force in the morning, but it will necessarily be very small.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.
