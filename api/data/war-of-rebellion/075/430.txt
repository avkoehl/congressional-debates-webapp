of the flooring of the two road bridges over the Etowah near Kingston, and have the bridges guarded by the dismounted cavalry of your command. You will also cause the fords of the Etowah, between Kingston and the Etowah railroad bridge, except Island Ford, to be obstructed by felling trees across each other and by other means at hand. Island Ford will also be guarded by dismounted cavalry. The guards at the bridges and Island Ford should be well protected by barricades and breast-works, to enable them to effectively prevent the rebels from burning the bridges and crossing the ford. You will cause the river-bank between Kingston and the Etowah railroad bridge to be patrolled by cavalry. Keep scouts out well to your right, watching and giving you timely notice of any movement of the enemy in the direction of Rome. Also keep a watch upon the enemy reported by you to be in the mountain to your left and rear.

Yours, very respectfully,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,June 7, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: After examining General Hooker's position, and all the roads upon the right flank of the army, I have occupied the following positions, viz: Hovey's division covering the intersection of the Marietta and Acworth roads, and in close support of Hooker's right. Hascall's division in the position occupied by General Butterfield on the 5th, covering one of the roads toward the Burnt Church and Burnt Church and Burnt Hickory, upon which our trains are still moving. Cox's division in the position occupied by Hascall yesterday, covering the roads leading to our right and right rear. This separates my divisions somewhat, but they are all within easy supporting distance of each other; and the Fourth Army Corps from its present position can easily support either in case of necessity. My whole corps can be deployed upon Hooker's right in a very short time, if necessary. I think this is the best disposition I can make during the interval preceding the movement of the 9th. Please inform me if you would have it otherwise. The enemy is fortifying Lost Mountain. Batteries upon or near the summit and exterior lines are distinctly visible.

Very respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-THIRD ARMY CORPS,June 7, 1864-5 p.m.

Very respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
