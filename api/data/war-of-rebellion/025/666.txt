HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE TENNESSEE, Tupelo, Miss., July 31, 1862.

Governor PETTUS,Governor of Mississippi:

GOVERNOR: I have sent a gentleman to General Van Dorn asking his co-operation in a proposed movement of our combined forces. My proposition presupposes your co-operation. I therefore send a gentleman, the Rev. Mr. Gladney, to lay the matter before you and to ascertain your views. I inclose a copy of the letter [see Inclosure C] which I have addressed to General Van Dorn. I shall immediately order forward every efficient man who can be spared for the protection of the depots and arsenals within the district. I would like to order every one of them who is in the Confederate service forward, and by supplying their places with militia you can enable me to do so. I also respectfully urge upon you the importance of immediately sending to my army as many recruits, by conscription or otherwise, as you possibly can. We can quickly relieve your State of the presence of the foe if we will only be prompt, energetic, and bold.

I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, your obedient servant,

STERLING PRICE,

Major-General, Commanding.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,THOS. L. SNEAD,
