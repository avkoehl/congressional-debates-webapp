upon the conduct of public functionaries, without I
any responsible accuser whatever. The gentle- |
man from Illinois [Mr. Richardson] had said that j
he know nothing- of the truth of theie charges, but i
that he had the information fiorn somebody: who jj
wos thcit somebody? If there was somebody II
who had eommunicatfd this information to the l'
gentleman from Illinois, let thnt somebody come :j
forward as a responsible person, let the ".haii-cs bo !
nipde m a proper form, ?*nd then an inveFt'i^uhm ,
of th$m be hnd. There wa3 nn ^entlcm>n on hi.-5 j
side of the Houae, he took the responsibility ^f !,
saying, who desned to conceal any«hi/,i.  in reyvud
to the mat'Lei'-—there wa? nobody who desired to j;
prevbiit the tbcis, the whole f.i'Ms fiom boing pre- ]i
scnted fo the House and u:e oount y. The. ques- >'
tioa v/u'-, wh..f, ^an the proper mode—the mode I'
whir'-1 v, a' s:1'*'' to the public officers and to the j;
IIoq-i"•? Ourely this Rouse, without the facts be- }.
foic ther.i, v-ith^ut any responsible accuser, would j|
nor, undertake to p:.ss a vote of reprobation, of y
accusation against any public officer. Let the j;
proper course be pursued, and as a friend of the n
Secretary of the interior, he desired the fullest i:
investigation to be had. jj
Mr."STANTON, of Tennessee, paid that it ;i
seemed to him that there ought to be but little dif- ji
ficuity m the question before the House, and that, !.
go far a^ he was conccrnen, he could have no dif- i;
fifidty in ('CrvJui^ upr,n the coui^c •.vhk'h it was jj
necessary for him, af a Reprr^nt^tive of the peo- ['
p'.e, to in Tctutiop to it. It see.iv'd to him I!
to be sufficient that r member rose in his place, ;j
and piefcrrcd ohnrgea against a hhrh cilicer of the ;j
Government, ?nd staled his belief that they were i:
tree, in pursuing- such a course, the gentleman j,
certainly took upon himsdf a hi^h decree of re- i[
sponf-ibditv, a.'.d ;dih"uirh he disclaimed any per- !!
sojial knowledge of the charges, surely- no gentle-- !
man \vAi'!'! on,v 'he condition in which he wo\ld ,J
be placed, if thc^e ehanrcs should turn out to Lfe
futile Gi' n.i^on  ltd. v _ ;
Mr. YvmiIVS denned to ask a question. ;
]Vj'\ F„TA vxidyd for the purpose.
-\*r. V/C-J JTE (scnrcely heard) was understood 1
to inquire, whether he undei^tood the gentleman (
as stating that the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. i
Eiciiarpson] hnd made any charges? ,
Mr- STANTON (continuing) said, he spoke of |
the charges whi.di these gentleman who opposed j
the resolutions in the form in which they wore [
presented, said were to be inferred irom the face j
of the resolutions themselves. If th°re were no I
charges, what objection could be mads to the re- I
solutions ? He understood that the ground of op- !
position to them was, that chargrs were to be i
inferred from thess resolutions. Now, if there |
were the chariies. and there were the suspicions  i
Mr. rAK'T.Il'interpObal, (Air. Stanton yield- j
ing the floor,) and \va? understood to ask, \vuat the i
gentleman him-elf inferred from the re^o'utions 3 |
Mr. STANTON (continuing) said, that he in- j
ferreel nothing. The resolutions proposed an !
inquiry iato or;tain facts, and into the circum- j
stance? under which these facts occurred, if there j
v/as any inferroncc to be drawn unfavorable to !
the Secretary of the Interior, the responsibility
rested with the mover of the resolutions. That
gentleman had staged his belief, that he could sus-
tain every fact which had been set forth. ^ It there
was no injurious charge, why did the friends of
the Secretary of the Interior become so excited on
the mere presentation of the proposition r Why
did the orsan of die Secretary assail the gentleman
from Illinois [Mr. Richardson:] with charges so
grossly calumnious in their character? (and in
ii-an"1 this lan^aarsfe he did not exceed the truth)
Why was ail this excitement ptoduced in the
minds of the conductors of the or^an, and of the
friends of the Secretary of the Interior on this
floor, if there was nothing in the facts presented
bv tne genilftnan from Illinois, and which were
vouched for by the expression of his belief in their
truth? And how wis it, that the gentleman from
Ohio [Mr. Vinton*] assumed, that the adoption of
the rcsohitions would bo equivalent to a vole ot
condemnation against the Secretary?

]U'
Of the facts of the case he (Mr. S.) knew noth-
ing. He was not disposed to suspect that the
Secretary had done anything wron'j,; but in his
(Mr. S.'s) judgment, the character of the Secre- ■
tary, and a sense of justice to his friends, required •
that the resolutions should be passed 'n the lotm
in which they had been pr^s^nrod. There v,'as a
irreat diii'prcnce between si.nply sending sn inquiry
ro thr Srorct. ry of "he Depnirn;cut ami mstimpn?
an h'ouiry bv a committcc ot tins hiousc. I he
Secreiarv and his friends would ha\e every oppor-
tunity ot justifyin;- them-^'b.) s, <\nd of defending-
the action of the Aomiii'-tfation from injurious
suspicions. It was due to them; it was due to
the character of the Administration; it was due to
the character «.f tne Government; it was due to the
people whose minds had, to a great extent, been
poisoned by suspicions against tins distinguished
functionary, that ihc inve?ngation should be made
by the Hcprcsf-nUitivcs of the people themselves.
In this cour.se of pr<)cecdmg tnerc Was nothing,
that lie could s^e, at all improper or nr-jus' towaids
any individual. An orticlc had been published in
the UepuhHc ol.Saturday lust which, he supposed,
would throw some li^ht upon the suiject. It was
as follows:

Now here (Mr. S. continued) was a oircct chai-
lenge—a chHiiejise to a course of conduct impos-
ing, as he had said, heavy re;.pons:oihty upon
the gentleman fiom Hb'noih—a rt-spon&iuiluy^uom
which, as the gentleman had abundantly shown :
tins morning, he had no disposition to snunk; ;
and the question ww, whether the genrSemen on '
the other side of the Kou<e would shrink from the ■
responsibility of the investigation ? For himself, :
he (Mr. S ) made no chaiges and indulged_ in no
suspicions. He hod no desire to indulge in any
suspicions. Piss tamest desire was that the accu-
sations misrht turn out to bo untrue: and thnt all

be placed on these was sufficiently evident frora
what the gentleman from Tennessee had just read
—he did not regard that as sufficient to justify this
j proceeding. The press, he regretted to say, had
j degenerated into a mere national common sewer
1 of falsehood and detraction. That is what the
| press has become, and there should at least he
i found one man who was not afraid to say it. The
| newspaper prc<^ had become so degraded that it
I has lost the power to injure any one, since it has
j! become the vehicle through which the host of
!j petty scribblers, infesting every avenue and thor-
■! ou^hfare, vented their malignity and falsehoods.
| And would the House be ready to granta poxn-
i mittee of this inquisitorial character on no higher
j authority than this street press ?
[ He reminded the House that the Constitution
I and laws sccured every man against malicious
J prosecution, by attaching responsibilities to prose-
j cutors. In the case of the Doorkeeper of this House,
j specific charges were exhibited_ against him. be-
! fore a committee of investigation was granted,
j The gentleman from Illinois may have seen these
j charges preiened against the Secretary and may
! believe them. But he does not stand forward here
| to vouch for any of these charges, if the gentle-
i man from Illinois had made haltself the responsi-
! Me accuscr m this case, the question would have
i stood on totally d-ffercnt ground,
i Mr. RICHAR.DSON (Mr Toombs yielding
' the floor tbr the purpose) stated that he knew
, nothing personally of the trutn or falsehood of
these chargcs. He kne\i^thcin only from others,
! and throu2h the nubhc press.
1 Mr. TOOMBS, (resuming.) Let those others
ji come here. He v/as not willing to vote for the
' i committee to investigate charges of this serious
■ impnit, unless they were biought forward by^
1 soiv,o responciblo accuser,
M&CLEI1NAND (Mr. Toombs yielding
•V, fi.mr) wUUed to put a question to liis friend
fsviQi Iiliiiois. Fie bod sjid thnt hp hud ootained
tin; erehraced in these charges from various
sources. Piu thct gcntlemin believe these facta
to he true ?
j Air. IUCHARDSON stated that his object m
. tiiovii:" for this cornvrnltee was to bring these per-
; Rons from whom iie had received his information
'! bef-.re that committee to give their testimony.
Mr. TOOMBS, (resuming.) He knew that such
! j was the object of the gentlemnn. But he objected
■'I to tiii? mnric.of procedure as contrary to the leeis-
lativo practice in sucli cases. The effect of this
■ I mnovatieii on the established course, would be to
|, enable ary individual to introduce charges against
b any nubhc oinccr, and to demand the appointment
j! of a committee to investigate these charges. And
'! there wns an important reason why this course
; should not be admitted mto practice. An indi-
Jl vidual v. iK; comes forward and calumniates a pub-
!| lie nfri'.cr by false charges, occupies the position of
i a libeller, nnd as ?ueh, is aiiricmtb'.e to the laws.
!i fVit: when a gentleman rises on this floor to make
■' charitcs, he exercises merely his hi?h privilege as a
1 member of this House, and hicivs no legal pen-
| a; 1" as a libeller who circulates slanders withotvt
the violation of pai'lui-nciita'-y piiti'ege. Let
those who have barhidieu tlie gent'eman from
■l Illinois with tbe inf'i'niua'ii on \i hich he founds
I v)(^ clu'r'-'t^, coi1:? ■; this hiouse and exhibit theni.
Ht is no bet'.cr t!:r.n a iibtlier who will notdo this.
r. T. th.en read a clause from the Conslitntion,
v' i -b s- cuies an individual from having his
i, I'iva.ied,  nil all his papers ransacked and

prived of the rights secured to every citij-en as
soon as he becomes an officer of the Jnited states.
'J'he«e resolutions give authority to siese every-
body's papers. In the cace of any citizen, no such
