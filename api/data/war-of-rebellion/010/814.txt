full to me as soon as we returned to Corinth. Colonel Clack was also directed to detail an officers with sufficient force to take charge of and bring off the knapsacks, blankets, clothing, &amp;c., which had been left by the enemy in his flight. As my command filed by on their return to Farmington I observed Lieutenant Browne, with a detail of 20 men, collecting these articles, many of which had already been scattered and carried off by troops in passing. Having no wagons at hand, I directed Lieutenant Browne to take the most valuable articles, such as blankets, overcoats, knapsacks, &c.,and bring them off the field, but to prevent stragglers from lingering around the place in search of plunder; to gather all the valueless stuff, such as old underclothes, &c., and burn them. Both Captain Macmurdo's and Lieutenant Browne's reports are herewith transmitted.

On reaching the point in the rear of Farmington indicated by the division commander I communicated with General Ruggles through Lieutenant James, of my staff, who soon returned with orders for me to resume my position within the trenches at Corinth, where my command arrived about sundown.

Accompanying this report will be found a list of casualties in my command, showing a loss of 3 killed, 49 wounded, and 1 missing.* As this list does not, however embrace the information desired in every particular by a recent circular from general headquarters I have this day required a report from regimental and battalion commanders in conformity therewith, which will be transmitted at the earliest practicable moment.

It is proper for me to state that the troops of my command, with inconsiderable exceptions, bore themselves on this occasion in a manner highly creditable to themselves and their regimental commander. None of them except the Florida Battalion and the Washington Artillery ever having been under fire before, it could hardly be expected that a few would not shrink from the first volley of a concealed foe. The Twenty-fifth Louisiana Regiment, though recently raised and arrived since the battle of Shiloh, behaved like veterans, maintaining their line unbroken, and always moving forward with spirit and alacrity whenever ordered to do so. Great credit for this state of things in a new regiment is due to the discipline as well as the gallantry displayed by the officers of the regiment, both field and company.

The Florida Battalion, Lieutenant-Colonel Clack commanding, gained fresh laurels in the field by their discipline, valor, and promptness; both officers and men fully sustained the high reputation they had won on the bloody hills of Shiloh, never faltering, ever in the van.

A large portion of the Thirty-sixth Mississippi regiment, although never having formed a line of battle or heard a hostile gun before, behaved with that gallantry and spirit which characterized the troops of that chivalrous State on every field. It is not doubted but the reputation of the State will be fully sustained on any future occasion requiring a display of intrepidity and valor.

The Thirty-seventh Mississippi, Colonel Benton, on this occasion was detached from my brigade, and appeared upon the field under the immediate command of Brig. General L. M. Walker who will report upon their conduct on the occasion. On one portion of the field, however, they came under my immediate observation, and made a most gallant charge on my right, and in conjunction with the Twenty-fifth Louisiana Regiment.
