The day was hot and sultry, and whenever troops or wagons were moving the dust hung in dense clouds. About 5 p. m., however, it began to rain, and continued to do so with slight intermissions all night, which was a great comfort to the men and animals. By order of General Meade, a full issue of rations was made to the troops on the evening of the 2nd, and the empty wagons resulting were turned over to the medical department for transportation of wounded. A train of army wagons and ambulances was organized on the morning of the 3rd, in the usual manner and under the usual orders, the numbers sent being as follows:

Second Corps.............................................. 768

Fifth Corps............................................... 235

Sixth Corps............................................... 790

Ninth Corps............................................... 84

Eighteenth Corps.......................................... 300

Total..................................................... 2,177

At 5.30 a. m. a general attack was made by the army on the enemy's works. Their works consisted of tiers of rifle-pits, behind which were a continuous line of breast-works, solidly constructed of pine logs and earth, the top log raised in some instances so that the muskets might be fired under it. The Second Corps at first met with partial success, carrying the first line of works, but these were so enfiladed that they were compelled to fall back, leaving a large number of dead and wounded. The number of wounded brought off was as follows:

Second Corps................................................ 1,280

Fifth Corps................................................. 322

Sixth Corps................................................. 489

Ninth Corps................................................. 646

Eighteenth Corps............................................. 51

Cavalry Corps............................................... 28

Total....................................................... 2,980

The hospitals of the Fifth, Sixth, and Second Corps were fully prepared for the emergency, and their supply was so complete that they were able to spare freely for the necessities of the other corps. The usual results of the lack of an ambulance organization were painfully perceptible in the Eighteenth Corps, 2 or 3 soldiers leaving the ranks with each severely wounded man, and forgetting to return, while the roads and woods were lined with stragglers, as the slightly wounded preferred to go back to White House on foot rather than to go to a hospital where they knew there was no shelter and but scanty supplies.

A part of the stores of the Eighteenth Corps arrived from White House during the day, and among them forty hospital-tents flies, which, being pitched end to end and the sides fastened to a railing raised 2 feet from the ground, formed a series of very excellent hospital wards. About 1,100 wounded were left on the field from the day's engagement, it being impossible to remove them, as they were between the lines and completely covered by the enemy's sharpshooters. The result of the battle was not decisive, the enemy retaining his original position at nightfall, while the hostile lines were at some points not more than 100 yards apart, each being protected by breast-works of logs and earth.
