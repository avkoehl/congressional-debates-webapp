AM ICR J.; AN" CUTLERY.
Again, the duty on table cutlery is 35 per
cent. The duty on the ivory of which the han-
dles are made, when imported directly from
the coast of Africa or India, is 10 per cent.;
but as our commerce is nearly destroyed with
those coasts by our insane legislation and re-
strictions, most of the ivory used here comes
by the way of Europe, and must therefore pay
20 per cent. The price of the steel of which the
blade of the knife is made is increased by the
duties and the premium on gold to the extent
ot GO to 80 per cent. AH this is a manifest
and unjust discrimination against the develop-
ment of this great branch of industry in this
country. Yet, in spite of this unjust partiality,
it has grown and prospered so that it com-
mands almost the entire domestic market,
and to a small extent supplies some foreign
markets.
But if the manufacturers of cutlery could
have the ivory and the steel as cheap as their
foreign competitors, or as cheap as they would
be with a fair and moderate impost, the busi-
ness would immediately become very extensive
and useful, and supply entirely the domestic
markets, and successfully compete in most
l'oreign markets. The Americans have success-
fully established this great business, notwith-
standing these obstructive duties, chiefly by
the aid of their superior ingenuity and mechan-
ical skill. In Europe all the parts of the knife,
for example, are made by hand, almost un-
aided by labor-saving machines, while here it
is just the contrary. This single industry now
gives employment probably to more hands than
are engaged in the manufacture of steel in
the United States. Yet this is only one of
ten thousand more or less important industries
which are more or less crippled, discouraged,
or destroyed by these excessive duties in order
to enrich a few.
COST OF DUTY ON IKON AND STEEL.
A person unacquainted with the effects of
these enormous duties on iron and steel and
their products would very naturally conclude
that they would yield a munificent revenue to
the Government. But it is a significant fact
1 All gold figures.
that they produce less than $10,01)0,000 per
annum, which is less than the sum derived
from either tea or coffee, and not one third as
much as that derived from sugar. Yet these
$10,000,000 paid to the Government by the
importers in the first place are shown by reli-
able estimates to be less than one tenth of the
amount paid annually by the people on account
of the duties on steel and iron and their vari-
ous manufactured products. In other words,
$100,000,000 is lost to the people annually
from the almost universal enhancement of the
prices of all commodities made in part or
wholly of iron or steel, or made with the aid
of any of the products of iron or steel, and
from the correspondingly increased cost of all
the services performed by any structure, ma-
chinery, or agency constructed partly or wholly
of iron or steel.
Thus these taxes affect directly and oppress-
ively the price of the poor woman's sewing-
machine, the crippled soldier's artificial limb,
the implements of husbandry, the tools of the
artisan and the common laborer, the freights
for transporting all the products of agriculture
to market, the costs of all freights and travel,
and indeed of most of the necessaries of life.
The people expected some substantial relief
against these heavy burdens, some material
reduction of the duties on these necessaries of
industry, these aids of toil, these essential
elements of progress, development, and civili-
zation. But they are again disappointed ; the
monopolists are triumphant, and the people
must continue to pay tribute to them.
SPOOL COTTON.
Mr. Chairman, I must give a few more illus-
trations of the manner in which this bill re-
deems the pledge to reduce the burdens on the
people. In the three years ending June 30,
1861, the average annual import of spool-cot-
ton was 6,685,200 dozens, and the duty was
24 per cent, ad valorem. The average price of
the best quality was 45 cents per dozen, which
would make the cost of the whole import
$3,008,310. In 1868, the import was 3,819,573
dozens, on which the duty was from 63 to 67
per cent ad valorem, and the average price was
$1 10 per dozen, making the whole cost of the
quantity imported $3,871,530 30. In other
words, the American consumer paid in 1861
$3,008,340 for 0,685,200 dozens, and in 1868
he paid $3,871,530.30 for less than half the
quantity, or for 3,319,573 dozens. In 1868-69
the same thread cost $1 10 per dozen, or 65
cents per dozen more than in 1861. The busi-
ness, in consequence of this enormous duty,
has been greatly stimulated, and it is now esti-
mated that 10,000,000 dozens are produced
annually.
The cost has advanced somewhat by reason
of the high price of cotton, but this increase
does not add 15 cents per dozen; but assume
that it adds 25 cents per dozen, leaving 40
cents per dozen occasioned by the tariff', and
then the interesting fact remains that the peo-
ple pay $4,000,000 per year for the precious
privilege of having this cotton manufactured
by a few men in Connecticut and Massachu-
setts. But the Treasury only received of these
duties $975,109 88, leaving a net balance for
the manufacturers of $3,024,890 12 paid by
the consumers. This, however, is not now
satisfactory, and the Ways and Means Com-
mittee propose to give these gentlemen a fur-
ther bounty, ranging from 6 cents per dozen
and 30 per cent, ad valorem to 12 cents per
dozen and 30 per cent, ad valorem, according
to quality, thus adding other generous millions
of the consumers' money to their profits and
a few more thousands to the country's rev-
enues and they call this reducing the people's
burdens.
TIN.
Mr. Chairman, another illustration of the
mysterious ways of tariff-making is afforded by
the duty on the common article of tin. The
present duty on tin plates, of which common
cups, milk-pails, buckets, fruit-cans, and many
other things are made, is 25 percent., equal to
li cent per pound ; but this bill proposes to
raise the duty to 2J cents per pound. No tin
plates are at present made in the United States,
but it is understood that a man in Pennsyl-
vania proposes to establish a manufactory, and
this enormous increase of duty is put on for his
