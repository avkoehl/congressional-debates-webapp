It has this moment been reported to me that several of the enemy`s camps were removed during last night. Shall be able to determine the direction shortly if this should be found to be the case.

JUNE 4, 1863. (Received 12 m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK, &amp;C.,

Washington:

Following received from General Buford, June 4:

Nothing noteworthy to report. Yesterday colonel Duffie`s pickets reported enemy crossing in considerable force at Sulphur Springs. Preparations made to welcome them, but they did not come. Country and river, as high up as Orleans, New Baltimore, and Thoroughfare Gap, visited yesterday and last night. Nothing was seen or heard.

J BUFORD.

The movements of the enemy in our front do not indicate what their purpose or object may be. Has General Dix`s force moved to White House or beyond there? His position, strength, and movements may govern or influence the enemy somewhat. I should like to be fully advised.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding. -
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 4, 1863. (received 6. 20 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Following from one of our scouts:

I heard from at least three different parties, who I know had the means of obtaining the correct information, that General Jones had come from the Shenandoah Valley; that his headquarters were either in Rappahnnock or Culpeper, and not very far distant from Culpeper Court-House, and that this information was obtained from some of his cavalry whose homes were in Fauquier, and who had been over to see their fiends.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.
