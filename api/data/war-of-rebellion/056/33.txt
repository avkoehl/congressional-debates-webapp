HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Iuka, Miss., November 3, 1863.

Brig. Gen. G. M. DODGE,Comdg. Left Wing, Sixteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: A dispatch from General Stevenson received at 3 o'clock p.m., which was directed to you, but referred to me in consequence of your absence, stated that Collierville had been attacked by a large force of the enemy, and requesting a supply of small-arms ammunition from here. I should have sent the ammunition immediately but there was no train here at the time. I shall send it forward as soon as cars arrive.

A dispatch, received since the above, from General Stevenson states that a fight is taking place at both Collierville and Germantown. Colonel Chetlain and Lieutenant-Colonel Phillips have arrived here with the division train.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. W. SWEENY,

Brigadier-General.

Brig. Gen. J. C. VEATCH,Comdg. Fifth Division, Memphis, Tennessee:

GENERAL: Send the force, requested to be ready, by train now waiting, to Germantown. Let them occupy the fort and ground there, and report their presence to Colonel Hatch, who has gone forward to Collierville. If the enemy are too strong for our cavalry, it will make a good place for a rally. At all events, it will protect so much of the road. If Colonel Hatch shall call for them at Collierville, it may be necessary to go on, but otherwise only hold Germantown and the road thereabouts.
