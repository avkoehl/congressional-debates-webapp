MUNFORDVILLE, October 8, 1863.

Captain HARE:

I have just received reliable information that rebels, supposed to number 100, burned train on Lebanon branch road to-day. I have information also that rebels design making a raid on Louisville and Nashville road for purpose of destroying Rosecrans' line of communication. Use the greatest vigilance and precaution to prevent the destruction of the bridge.

Respectfully,

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, October 8, 1863.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Knoxville, Tenn,:

When did General Burnside leave Knoxville? Which way did his troops move?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Vicksburg, Miss., October 9, 1863.

Brigadier General T. KILBY SMITH,

Commanding Brigade:

GENERAL: You will embark you brigade as soon as possible on whatever boats can be provided and come to this point. It is important that you should be here with your command at the earliest moment practicable.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, October 9, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT,

Commanding Sixteenth Army Corps:

DEAR GENERAL: The way to stop that force, which is evidently threatening the flank of our movement, is to send a good brigade of your corps straight for Holly Springs. The moment the head of the column reaches Byhalia, that force will disappear from Lamar and Salem.. I don't believe the eighteen pieces of artillery, nor much the infantry, but Sweeny has one of my brigades and I will send another out to-night, but I want them both to push on at once.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
