RICHARD ARNOLD,

Brigadier-General, and Chief of Artillery.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. THIRTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Numbers 39. Carrollton, La., September 26, 1863.

Major-General Herron, having received leave of absence some time since from the department commander, with the true spirit of a soldier, remained with his men as long as the special service intrusted to him required. That command being about to join the corps, the leave of absence takes effect.

In parting with General Herron, though but for a time, the general commanding deems it a fitting opportunity to thank him for the promptness and efficiency with which every order that carried him toward the enemy has been obeyed; and for the zeal and bravery displayed by his command during the rapid, difficult, frequent, and successful campaigns conducted by Major-General Herron in person.

By order of Major General E. O. C. Ord:

WALTER B. SCATES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,Washington, September 28, 1863.

Memoranda for Generals Banks, Grant, and Steele.

The rebel Secretary of War directs General Kirby Smith to break up all plantations within 8 or 10 miles of the Mississippi River, on west side, remove the negroes, and remove or destroy the cotton. He is also directed to organize batteries of artillery to operate on that shore
