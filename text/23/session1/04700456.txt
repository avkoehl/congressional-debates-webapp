THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 16,
merits, and from that circumstance alone would be
cunent, at par, although the bank itself might be
wholly unable to redeem them Such a bank is a
nuisance It is the dog in the manger It might
lend money to business men, at short dates, to the
last day of its existence, yet the signs are for a
new pressure—a new game of distress for the fall
elections in Pennsylvania, New Yoik, and Ohio
If that game should be attempted, (Mr B said,)
jt would have to be done without excuse, for the
bank was full of money, without pietext, for the
deposite farce is over, without the aid of panic
speeches, for the Senate will not be m session
Mr. B said, that among the strange events
which took place in this world, nothing could be
moiestrange than to find,in ourown countiy, and
in the nineteenth century, any piactical illustra-
tion of the ancient doctrine of the metempsycho
sis Stranger still, if that doctrine should be so
far improved as to take effect m soulless bodies,
for, according to the founders of the doctrine, the
soul alone could tiansmigrate * Now corporations
had no souls, that was law, laid down by all the
books, and ofallcoiporations, moneyed ones espe-
cially, and above all, the Bank of the Uni ed Slates
was most soulless. Yet the rumor wus, that this
bank intended to attempt the opeiation oi effecting
a transfer of hei soul, and after submitting to
death in hei present form, to nseunina newone
Mr B said he, for one, s íould be ready for the
old sinner, come in the body of what heist it
might No form should deceive him, not even if
it condescended, in its new shep-, to issue fiom
Wall street, instead of Chesti ut'
A word more, and Mr B was done     It was
a word to those gentlemen whose declara ions,
many ten thousand times issued from this flooi,
had deluded an hundied thousand people to send
memorials here, certifying what those gentlemen
bo incontinently repeated, that the RLMOVJ1L of
the DEPOSITES had made the DISTRESS, and
nothing but the RESTORATION of ike DEPOS
JTES, 01 the RENE WM. ofthe CHARTER, could
REMOVE the DISTRESS '   Well, the deposites j
sie not restored, and the charter is noi lenewed,
and yet the distress ts gone     What is the infer
ence>   Why, that gentlemen are convicted, and .
condemned, upon then  own argument'   They'
leave  this Chamber to go home  self convicted
upon the very teat which they themselves have es-
tablished , and after having declared for six months,
upon this floor, that the lemoval of the deposites
made the distiess, and nothing but their restora-
tion, or the renewal of the bank chartei, could
relieve it, and that they would sit here until the
dog-days, and the wmtei solstice, to effect this res-
toration, or renewal, they now go home in good
time foi harvest, without effecting the restoration i
of the renewal, and find eveiywhere, as they go, 1
the evidences of the highest prosperity which ever
blessed the land     Yes' repeated and exclaimed ,
Mr B  with great emphasis, the deposites are not ,
restored—the charter is not renewed—the distiess I
is gone—and the distress speeches have ceased '
No ¡pore lamentation over the desolation of the
land now, and a gentleman who should undertake !
to entertain the Senate again in that way, in the
face of the present national prosperity—in the face
of the present report from the Secretary of the
Treasury—would be stared at, as the Trojans were
accustomed to stare at the frantic exhibitions of
Priam's distracted daughter, while vaticinating the |
downfall of Troy in the midst of the heroic ex- ¡
ploits of Hector                                                          i

I objection

the b'll early in the day He begged leave to

up at all Wheie was the Treasury of the United

take up the bill at all till something was done to
restore the treasury of the United States to a place
of safe custody

necessary He would give notice, then, that to-
morrow morning, after the reading of the Journal,
he would move to take up the bill

a discussion would or ought to ensue. But he
thiewit out as a suggestion, whether it was proper
to discuss thus bill when the public tieasure was
in its present condition
Mi FORSYTH suggested to the gentleman
I fiom South Carolina, [Mr Piestov,] that if such
a question was to be agitated, it was is well to
urge it on the final passage of the bill as now If

ment reported by the Committee on Finance
