side should be pressed before 5 p. m., it is believed the most efficient aid you can render him is to attack vigorously where you are. You can send him, in case of urgent request, a portion of your force, but the general effect of your movement on the whole line will be greater where you are than in any change of position requiring time to execute.

Brigadier-General MOTT,

Commanding Division, Second Corps:

Captain Mendell, Engineers, will report to you and aid you in selecting the point of attack to be made at 5 p. m. He will also remain with you until it is over, and will also express to you verbally my views as to the general dispositions you should make. Attack promptly and vigorously at the appointed hour.

HEADQUARTERS FOURTH DIVISION,May 10, 1864-2.05 p. m.

General WRIGHT:

GENERAL: I was ordered to connect with General Burnside, on my left. My line of pickets is so extended that my troops for assault will not be more than 1,200 to 1,500 men, so that I am very weak. To call in the pickets on my left will take all the time, if not more than 5 p. m. Shall I send for them?

HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 10, 1864.

Brigadier-General MOTT,

Commanding Fourth Division, Second Army Corps:

I regret that your skirmish line is so extended, but if you cannot withdraw a part of the left in full time, you will not attempt to do so, but advance the whole at 5 p. m., as previously ordered, following it at the proper moment by your column of attack, made as strong as your numbers will permit. Use your artillery freely whenever there is a chance, as it serves to inspirit our men and demoralize the enemy, even if it does not hurt them much. I think you can enfilade their line with it. I rely much on the effect of your attack.
