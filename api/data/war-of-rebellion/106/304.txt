ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Headquarters Department of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:

SIR: I have to recommend that the general commanding the department give me authority to cause either Fort Hoskins or Fort Yamhill to be adandoned in the spring in time to send Captain Seidenstriker's company (D), First Washington Territory Infantry (now at the former post), into the field. I have directed an exploration to locate a wagon road from Fort Yamhill to the Siletz block-house to be made. It is believed that far better route can thus be found than that from Fort Hoskins to the same point. It is also believed that it will be no longer and capable of being easily made a wagon road. It would require great labor and expense to convert the Siletz pack trail from Fort Hoskins into a wagon road. There is but one Indian agent between the two points, Fort Ymahill and the Siletz. Thus it appears to me probable that I shall desire to order the evacuationnof Fort Hoskins. The superintendent of Indian affairs appeared to concur when I conversed with him on the subject of other day. I shall soon be able to write you in reponse to your letter of the 16th ultimo as to further arrangements necessary for the estblishement of a post at Fort Boise.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. ALVORD,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.
