LA GRANGE, December 3, 1863.

(Received 6.20 p. m.)

Major-General HURLBUT:

All was going well at Corinth last night. Mizner says Loring's division of infantry are down there somewhere. I found Mizner at Pocahontas with his command. I will send garrison back to Saulsbury in the morning.

Forrest has only one battalion with him; prisoners say 500 men, but I don't think he has over half that. We will need more to watch Lee than him, for he may swing around to the west of here. I believe Grierson has a force watching them.

Brigadier General A. J. SMITH,

Columbus, Ky.:

GENERAL: You will perceive from the telegram, copy of which has been sent you, that additional force has been sent you.

As soon as you receive them, I desire you to make up a strong flying column, and clear all the country between the Hatchie and the Tennessee down as far as Jackson. You will be guided in your line of operation by what you consider the best for the service. The enemy broke our line of road at Saulsbury yesterday, but are now in retreat. I have some uncertainty as to the movements below Corinth, as there are reports of infantry moving across by New Albany. I still think there will be no serious movement other than with mounted men.

Very truly, yours, &amp;c.,

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

Brigadier-General TUTTLE,

La Grange:

Have the railroad repaired as soon as practicable. What news from Corinth? Do you hear anything further of any infantry? What has become of Mizner's brigade of cavalry? Cover the track repairers and telegraph men as they move out.

Brigadier-General TUTTLE,

La Grange:

Open road and telegraph as soon as you can. Corinth is the point to which your attention must be directed mainly, and to hold which all other points east of La Grange must be abandoned.
