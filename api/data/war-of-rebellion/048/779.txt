my immediate notice for their cool, intrepid, and gallant conduct on the field during the engagement on the 27th of November, namely: Brigadier- General Morris, commanding First Brigade; Colonel Keifer, commanding Second Brigade; Colonel Horn, Sixth Maryland Volunteers; Colonel Truex, Fourteenth New Jersey Volunteers, and Colonel M. R. McClennan, commanding One hundred and thirty- eighth Pennsylvania Volunteers, the latter of whom was wounded. I was much gratified with the conduct of my division; both officers and men performed their duty manfully, and the States they represent may justly feel proud of their bearing on the occasion. I am under many obligations to the members of my staff for their assistance both in the field and on the march, and would particularly mention Lieutenant James Johnson, acting assistant adjutant- general; Major P. Vredenburgh, Jr., acting assistant inspector- general, and Lieutenant C. C. Jones, aide- de- camp.

I inclose herewith the reports of brigade commanders and list of casualties.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOS. B. CARR,

Brigadier- General.

Lieutenant Colonel O. H. HART,

Assistant Adjutant- General.
