ascertained that it cost more than $25,000 to get
this report What use would it be then if it was
not sent out' I want to see it in every neighbor-
hood I made charges four years ago against this
Post Office Department I was hissed, sir, for
doing so In the report of the committee, my
charges are fully, and more than realized A
report on this subject, in another quarter, had
been called factious The people wished to have
information from this House I repeat, that the
report made yesterday more than realizes all my
charges against the department I move to print
fifty thousand copies without the documents
They aie unnecessary I do not want to leave the
publication of the reports to the hireling news
papers, which just pick out enough to suit their
purposes
Mr H EVERETT said the gentleman from
Tennessee [Mr Crockett] was mistaken The
whole expenseof the investigation did rot amount
to more than $2,500 It had been made with the
strictest regaid to economy
Mr STODDERT did not rise to say anything
in relation to the number of the reports which
should be printed He would nevei be in favor
of excluding light from the people The history
of Congress, he believed, did not present a case
like the piesent, where a committee, constituted
as ¡his was, in an extensive investigation, had been
enabled to concur, so generally, as regarded facts,
and lesults The repoits contained an authentic
view of the facts—the very evidence which the
people would desne to see The committee had
extracted the ketnel and thrown away the husk
He therefore thought it wholly unnecessaiy to
print more than the usual number of the docu
ments accompanying the repoits If the gentle-
man from Rhode Island was desirous of extending
information on the subject to as many as possible,
his object would be better answered by applying
the a-oount which it would cost to print the five
thousand extra copies of the documents, to the
publication of an additional number of the reports
Mi B\RR1NGER thought a sufficient number
of the repoits and documents should be printed to
supply the clerk's offices and the publishers of
newspapers in the country This could not be
eileUed by a Ie<-s number thin five thousand copies
Mr LVERErr, of Vermont, said he had
understood that the expense of printing three
thousand copies of the reports and accompanying
documents would amount to about $10 000
Mr II^MFR said, if there was any business
winch ought to be done by human beings in the
daik,itwfl not the business of legislation Those
who undertake to |>resuibe rules foi the action of
themselves and otlieis, ought al least to have some
light upon the sul jects with regaid to which they
propose to legislate
It hid berotre a veiy common thing to traduce
the Post Office Department It was fashionable
to condemn it 1 here seemed to be a general in-
clination to bear it down Por one, he was not
disposed to |0in in the general " hue and ciy"
asjamst the department He concurred entirely
with his honoiable friend from Kentucky [Mr
Johnson] in the observations he let fa'l the other
(lay He had known the Postmaster General
lin", and known him well He had the most
mir linttonfi lence in lushonoi and mtegnty, both
asa public man and privateemzen Entertaining
tnis opinion of him, he would not condemn him,
until lie had the most unquestionable evidence of
lhe imj>ropne y of hisondutt
lie said he did not know, and therefote would
no] siy, but there might have been saiboidnmte
offi ers in the depaitment, who were not honest
He would not say f >i he did not know, but these
fcitboidin ttes muht have presented statements to
the Postmaster General which had deceived him,
and upon whiih he might have made ordeis that
were tie i imental to the public interests But it is
time eno igh to condemn him when we have heard
the proof It was time enough for him o con
demn him, wtien he had heard the evidence and
beard the defence, and the commentary upon that
evidence When the whole subject shall be pre
sented, therejiorts printed and laid on our tables,
when we have had time to read and dehbeiate
upon them, and have heard the department in
reply, then we should be prepared to act What-
soever is wiong, said he, I shall be among the first
to condemn If-anything is wrong, but has cir-
cumstances connected with it which ought to be
received as palliations, I shall insist upon those
circumstances having due weight But whatever
is right, although alleged to be wrong, whether
the charge be made by political enemies, or those
who were political friends upon the surface, he
would be prepared to defend to the last
What aie we about to do here' We are asked
to vote for the printing of fifty thousand copies of
these reports, without knowing one word of then
contents They have not been read All we
know of them is, that they are against the depait
ment Sir, 1 go against this system 1 will not
thus legislate in the dark upon any question
What have we seen in another part of this
Capitol ' I speik of what I learn from thenews-
papeis, everybody knows they are good author
ity A tepoit was made there by a majority and
a mmonty of a committee Before they could be
printed and laid upon their or our tables, a bill is
passed, which has come down to this House, to
reoiganize the whole Post Office Department
Thus passing sentence of condemnation upon it
without an examination of the reports of their
committee, or healing one word in defence Thus
dec anng that the whole department is so rotten
and corrupt that refoimation is impossible, and
it must, therefore, be thrown into the mill and
ground ovei anew The passage of the bill is
claimed by the party press of this city, and under-
stood by the country, to be such a condemnation
Aie we to follow this example' Is this the
system t > be established in tins country ' Sir,
(said he,) I have the most perfect respect for the
members of the committee who made these re
ports, but I will not legislate upon the repoitof
any committee will out hearing the other side
Have they not examined witnesses against the
depaitment without the persons implicated having
anuppoitumty to cross examine' May not many
things, seemingly wiong, be satisfactorily ex-
plained by cross examination, or by further testi-
mony ' Let us hear before we strike Whoever
heaid of a great department of the Government
being reorganized without consulting the head of
that department' If thei e be defects in its organ-
ization, who so competent to point them out and
suggest improvements as the man whose expen
ence has biought them lepeatedly before him '
Does any one believe that if weorder fifty thou-
sand cojnes of these reports to be printed we shall
receive them during the piesent session' Every
mai heie knows we shall not Do we not know
that the reports ordered to be punted by the
Senate at the I ist session, were travelling through
the country during the whole summer' They had
to be sent first to themembeis, and then taken up,
fianked, and sent off by mail again to different
portions of the country thus aiding to barden and
bieak down the very depaitment which they as-
sailed It will be an immense expense incurred
foi no real substantial benefit to the country
We are all aware that abstracts of these reports
will becnculated in the newspapeis everywhere
for the information of the people Now, there
ought to be a sufficient number of the reports
through the several districts of country to enable
any one to correct errors or misrepresentations
that may creep into the abstracts That is enough,
all beyond that is unnecessaiy I shall, therefore,
vote foi the smallest numbei proposed
Mr REED was in favor of printing the largest
number He expressed his surprise at some of
the lemarks of the gentleman who preceded him,
[Mi Hamck,] who had appealed to " hear before
we strike " lie would ask what course the gen-
tleman wo lid have the House pursue' A com
mittee had been appointed by the House to exam
me the condition of the Post Office Department,
and the íesult of its investigation should now be
published to the countiy
Mr SMini said Mr Speaker-, I think it was
well lemaiked that it became this House to looK
well to its own extravagant expenditures at the
noinent when they aie about to imoute to other
departments of the Government extravagances of
an extiaordmary character Sn, 1 ask the gen-
tlemen who piopose to print ti e extra number of
these documents proposed, whether they have
counted the cost' Has any gentleman who has
addressed the House mf&voi of so large a number
February 14,
made an estimate satisfactory to his mind of the
amount of cost which he proposes to imposeupon
the country > I have made an estimate, which, to
my mind, is satisfactory against the printing of
either number of documents proposed, I lay aside
the number suggested by the gentleman from Ten-
nessee [Mr Crockett] as being wholly beyond
the inclination probably of every other member of
the House I take the proposition of the gentle-
man from Massachusetts, and invite the House to
consider for a moment whether it be not of an
extravagant charactei
I understand the preposition to be to print five
thousand extra copies of each report, and the
several documents appended thereto The House
has already been informed by one of the honorable
members of the Post Office Committee [Mr
Beaudslfy] that these reports and accompanying
documents will certainly make two full-sized oc-
tavo volumes, consequently this will make ten
I thousand volumes Other gentlemen, however,
have said that they will amount to three volumes,
but I take the lowest estimate Now, these ten
thousand volumes will cost no less, upon an aver-
age, accoiding to the best information I have been
able to obtain, than thiee dollars per volume, for
asmallei number, say six or seven hundred, which
is the ordinary number, the cost per volume will
be near five dollars Take the number pro-
, posed, in all probability the price cannot be re-
' duced to less than three dollars per volume, and
heie it is at once a cost of $30 000 The gentle-
man further proposes to print twenty thousand
extra copies of the two reports alone, without the
documents It has been said that even these will
make a volume of fiom one hundred and fifty to
two hundred pages, and if we estimate the cost at
only a dollar a volume, you will have an additional
chaige of $20,000, at the least, making an aggre-
gate of $50,000 for the, publication of one single
íeport'
Sir, let me ask, are gentlemen prepared for this >
Is the country prepared for this' Suppose even
you go to the extent proposed, what good will be
produced' Five thousand copies of the entire
work, divided among the membeis of this House,
will not net to them, after reserving the necessary
copies for the Capitol, more than ten sets to each
member, and of the twenty thousand reports, the
net amount of each member for his district will fall
short of forty copies Now then, after you have
expended your $50,000 in the publication of this
lepoit, and you get forty copies of the report
without the documents, and ten copies with them,
for each district, put the question home to the con-
stituents of any gentleman, and ask them whether
they approve of such an expenditure undei the
pretence of furnishing such limited means of in-
formation to their district' Whatever the motive
may be, they will denounce it as an extravagant
expenditure
But, say gentlemen, the information cannot be
given thiough the newspaper organs     Why not'
Does any gentleman doubt that all the material
infoimation in each of these reports will be fur-
nished  to the  people  through   the newbpapeis'
I What is theobjection'    Why, forsooth, that they
will garble—to use the language of the gentleman
from Massachusetts—that they will garble the re-
ports, and present only such extracts as will suit
their own individual feelings or purposes     But
the same gentleman has also told us that the report
is of such an extraorumary character that it comes
with the concurrence of both branches—the major-
ity and the minontyof the committee   Why,Mr
Spi aker, if the report be the result of so  much
unanimity, where can be the danger or aprrehen-
I sion that garbled statements will be made, and the
i people miiled '    The very character of the report,
as represented by those in fa\ or of the larger iiym-
| bei, precludes the possibhty of the danger sug-
I gested as an argument m favor of printing that
large number
I     But, again, sir, the report being in itself the
result almost of unanimity in the committee, and
it being agreed on all sides, that all that is now
I necessary is  legislation, where can  be the great
I utility of multiplying copies of this repoit at such
an extraordinary expense to theTieasury'    Let
I me  submit this proposition  to those gentlemen
who are for printing so large a number, since it is
acknowledged on all sides that legislation only is
