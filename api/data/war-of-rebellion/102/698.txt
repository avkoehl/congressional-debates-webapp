No letters form you yet. I can do nothing without the following order from General Canby, which please communicate by telegraph:

The Nineteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry and One hundred and eighteenth Illinois (mounted) Infantry are hereby relieved from their present duties, and will report to Brigadier-General West, commanding Second Division of Cavalry. All officers and men of these two regiments on detached service will be immediately relieved and rejoin their regiments.
