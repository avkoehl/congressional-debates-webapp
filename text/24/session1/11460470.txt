commerce     The assessed value of her real and
personal estate, and her population at different
periods since the close of the late war with Great
Bntain,aie an unerring index to the íapid and
prosrressne improvement of the "West, and the
far West, which contribute so essentially to her
o-reatness * Here, too, in the sudden advance of
hei real tstate, the croakers of the present day
vv ill think they discover the woik of speculation;
and that this appait nt piospenty must give way
to some -violent íeaction     Sir, I am not in the
habit of mallín? picdictions, but I will venture
one in the present case, and that is, that without
some great and unexpected calamity, the man is
not now living who will ever see real estate in the
city of New York cheaper than it is at the pres-
ent time     The statistics of New York are ap-
plicable to evciy commercial city of the Union,
in proportion to the foreign and  internal com-
merce which they enjoy, and the elements which
enter into her greatness aie those which con-
tribute to the general prosperity of the whole
countiv.    But, sir, some of our political econo-
mists are frightened at this piospenty     They
think they see in it the seeds of our sudden de-
cline.   They have measured us by the old stand-
ards of Europe, and cannot encompass our rapid
and astonishing growth.    In truth, we have as-
tounded the European world—then  statesmen
and their philosophers have been baffled in all
their calculations and investigations, in relation
to us.   They have found that the rules which
they have been accustomed to apply to the nations
of thp Old Woild seemed to have no immediate
application to us     A people of yesterday, and
already the most prosperous on earth -our free
institutions command the admiration of the world
—our civil and religious hberty offers an asylum
to the oppressed of all nations     And still, in the
midst of this prospenty, in the full enjoyment of
all these blessings, we find at home, as well as
abroad, those who  cannot discover the   cause
which makes us, above all others, a happy, gieat,
and prosperous people.    Sir, it is contained in
two words.    It is our credit system.    But for
this, our canals and our railroads, our great works
of internal improvement of every kind, could never
have been made. The Erie canal, the wonder of
the age, must have remained a mere  project in
the imaginations of its projectois   That stupend-
ous work, which has added millions upon millions
to the value of property within the   extended
sphere of its influence, must have remained un-
executed but for the credit system     But foi this
system, those great works throughout the Union,
by which we have conquered time and space,
could never have been accomplished.    It is by
this means that the giant arms of this young and
giowing Republic  have piled piospenty upon
piospenty, mountains high, as the giants of old
piled Ossa upon Pelion, not like them, with a
view to scale the  heavens, but that she  might
place on its lofty summit the light of hberty, to
shed ltslustei and its benign influence throughout
the woild     Sit, that luster has been shed   that
influence has been felt, and is now being felt, in
different poitions of the glohe     Undo its magic
touch thrones have tiembled, dynasties have bee n
overturned, and ciowns have fallen     The ciedit
system is the distinguishing feature  between des
potism and liberty, it is the offspring of free in
stitutions, it is found to exist, and its influence
is felt, in propoition to the fieedom enjoyed by
any people. By freedom I do not mean unregula-
ted, uniestrained, natural liberty, but that freedom
which  is  founded on just and equitable laws,
where the rights of personal security, of private
property, and religious toleration, are guarantied
to every individual, where there is a gencial dif-
fusion of knowledge, and the existence of public
and private morality.    These are the elements,
and they together form the basis of public con-
fidence on which the credit system rests.    This
is the invention of modern times.

In the old Governments of Europe, wheie liberty
never found a resting-place, credit w is unknown
To the United States has been left the honor of
maturing  and  perfecting this system      To the
United States, also, is the honor due of having
filst applied the system of steam navigation    The
effc cts on the general prosperity of tin nation ha\ c
been is sensibly felt in the oncease asm the other,
and he who should at this day lccorumend an
entire abandonment of oui credit system foi isolc
and exclusne metallic cunency, v\ ould be deemed
no less visionary thin he who should attempt to
substitute a Pennsylvania vv agon for a locomotiv c
oi a canal packet, oi should cndeavoi to stem the
resistless current of the Mississippi in a flat-boat,
instead of those splendid palaces which now move
majestically on its wateis     Shall we then, Mi
President, check this tide of prosperity by the in-
troduction of new and untried schemes ? Shall w e
not be content with the nocessai ics, the comfoi ts,
the conveniences,and the luxuries of life, which
are so widely diffused throughout this whole coun-
tiy > Shall we attempt to overthrow, subvert, and |
destroy a system which has produced all these
blessings, which has brought happiness and plenty
to the door of every man, and that, too, for the
purpose of ad opting some of the exploded docti incs
of the political economists of Euiope'   Sir, you
might as well attempt to apply the common law
ot England, which was born and nurtured on the
Thames, to the Father of Waters in this western
world and to our mighty inland seas, compared
with which the boasted streams and lakes of Eu-
rope dwindle into nils and ponds beside them—
yes, these vast inland seas, into which, in the
language of a distinguished Senator of my own
State, you might cast the whole land of the com-
mon law, without producing a upple     Sn,I be-
lieve I speak the almost unanimous sentiment of
my political friends in this Senate, when I say
thoy intend no such thing     I believe I speak the
sentiment of the Democratic party throughout the
Union, when I say I believe they neither expect
nor desire any such thing     What, then, do they
expect or desire5    I answer, no more, nor no
less, than eveiy real fiiend to his country is will-
ing to adopt—namely, a preservation, and at the
same time a regulation, of the credit system.    In
all such measures of reform I will go as far as he
who goes farthest    Preserve and regulate, but not
dtstioy,is my motto.   Enlarge yourspi cie basis,
introduce as far as practicable agoldcuntncy, by
the prohibition of small notes, piovide means for
coining at the mint, take all propel measures to
prevent excessive issues of bank paper and the
unnccessaiy  mciease   of  bank   incorporations,
repeal youi testraimng laws, so as to permit the
fie e employment and investment of foi eign capital
Whatever danger there may be, is to be found in
the abuse of the system, and notin itscxistence.
Guard against these abuses, and coircct them when
discovered     An entire abandonment of the ciedit
system, and a return to a sole and exclusive metal-
lic cuín ncy, if it were practicable, would pioduee
desolation and destuirtion from one extiemity of
the Union to tin other     Such notions ought not,
cannot, must not pievail
Mr   Piesident, I hope I shall be pardoned for
this digiession fiom the mam subject of discus-
, sion     My apology will be found in the couise
' and chaiactei of this debate     The question again
i íecurs, what disposition shall be made of the sur-
i plus revenue>   That there will be a surplus seems
j to have been conceded oi taken for gi anted on all
hands, except by the Senator from Missouu.   It
I was anticipated by the Secretary of thcTieasury,
| and he recommended a mode of disposing of it.
What was that pioposition >   Why, su, m sub-
stance, that the Secretary should go into  the
maiket, by himself oragent, and mvestit in State
stocks     This pioposition was intioduced by my
honoiablo colleague, and if a surplus was not
anticipated, why introduce a pioposition to dis-
pose of that which it w as supposed vv ould hav e
no existence 3    The proposition recen ed but little
favor m the Senate     1 will not attempt to recapit-
ulate the objections which were made to it   Some
of them struck me as more imaginary than leal.
I did not appreciate them as other gentlemen did.
In the vote which was taki n upon my honoiablc
colli ague's pioposition, we found ourselves in a
lean minonty of four Being satisfi tl that some-
thing ought to be done, I deteimin d to unite m
a pioposition which should be moie genoially
satisfactory to my political filends The one
íepoited by the select commute e was—
" lint tlie money which-lull tic in tin Tie i-uij of the
Unite (1 st ite- on the l-titi\ of J mum, lsf7 r -civmgthe
sum ot $),000,000, «Inll be deposited with the several
tetite-, m propoition to their respective amount- ol popu
1 ition, a  i-cermiie el hv the last census, according to the
provision ot the -ci ond section ot the fn-t article ot tile
Constitution, anil the set re tar} ot the Tiea-my sin]] dc
liver the same to such p l-on a  the several stitesniay
authorize to rece ivc it on n 11 ivim; cerlilKatcs ot deposit
si_;n<d liv the compi te nt authorities e>t such state, each
tor such amount mil in such foim as the Secutar} of the
Tieisury m ly picsenbe, which shall s< t forth and expie-s
the obleiition of the State to pay the amount the leof to the
United states, or their issigns, uul which said ceitiheites
it sh ill be compete nt for the secretar}, of the Tri asur}, in
the name and lich ill of the United States, to si || -mil is-i^n
vv believer so directed bv am act of Congrí -«, ill salrs aiitl

per centum pe r annum pav able half yeailv from the tune
ot such sale and assignment, and shall be redeem ible at the
pleasure ot the State  i--uing the same "
That part of it which íequired an act of Con-
gress before the Secretary could sell and assiga
the ceitificates, was deemed objectionable. The
object was to keep the money so far under the
contiol of the Secietary as to enable him to use the
means when necessaiy. I accordingly offered
an amendment, which was adopted, by which
the Secretary was authorized, on behalf of the
United States, to sell and tiansfei the certificates
whenever tí should be necessary, Jor want oj other
money in the Treasury, to meet appi opi lations made
by Congress. This amendment removed the
principal objections to the bill. It placed the
avails of the money in the power of the Secre-
tary, whenever it should be required to meet such
appiopnations. If there should be means suffi-
cient in the Treasury to meet them, then, of
couise, the money would not be wanted. It
would never be called for until there was a defi-
ciency of means.
Let us now inquire, Mr. President, whether
this proposition, so amended, is one which ought
to be adopted' The idea of returning to the
States any surplus revenue which has been col-
lected from the people by indirect taxation, is
neither unheard of, nor novel. We have high
authority as to the expediency of this measure;
and if the proposition under consideration, which
is a meie deposit, and not a distubution, in-
volves no constitutional difficulty, then we have
the same authority in favor of its adoption.
This authority is one which no friend of the
Administiation will lightly disregard. President
Jackson, in his message of December, 1829, has
the following language.
" Aftei the extinction ot the public debt, it is not prob-
able that any adjustment ot the tantf, upon principles satis-
factory to the p-ople e3t the Unmn, will, until a remote
period, if evei, leave the Government without a consider
able surplus m the Freosuiy be} ond what nvtv be required
for its euirent suvice A.-, then, the period approaches
when the application ot the icvenue to the pi}inentof
debt will ceise, th di-po-ition of the surplus will pre-ent
a subject for the serious drhbention ot Congies-, and it
ma} he fortunate for the eountr} that it is }et to b  de
cided ( on-idcred in cemneetion v\ itli the difficulties vvhiefi
have lieretoiore attended appiopnations for purposes of
internil improvement, and with those which this expe
nence tells us will certainly arise, whenever power over
such subjects may he exercised by the General Govern-
ment, it ic hoped that it may lead to the adoption of some
plan which will reconcile the diversified interests ot the
States, anil -trt ngthen the bonds which unite them Every
member ot the Union, in peace and m war, will be bene
fited by the improvement of inland navigation and the
construction ot highway  in the several States. Let us,
then, endeavor to attain this benefit m a nioele which will
be s iti-iactory to all That hitherto adopted ha-, bv manV
of our fellow citi/ens, been deprecated as an infraction ot
the Constitution, while by others it lias been viewed as
I inexpedient All feel that it has been employed at the cx-
I pen-r ot hirmonv in the legislative eouneils
"To avoid these evils, it appear- to me that the most
safe, just, anil Federal disposition which could be made
ot ttie surplus revenue would be its apportionment among
the several State  according to their ratio of representa
tion , anel should this me isure not be found warranted by
the Constitution, that it would be expedient to propose to
the State - an amendment authorizing it. I regard an ap
peal to the source of power, in cases of real doubt, and
where its exercise is deemed nidispens ible to the general
welfare, as amon¿the most sacred of all our obligations "
] From this it would seem that a surplus was
anticipated aftei the extinction of the public debt,
