federate authority to deliver them to and I have no authority to send a flag of truce to hunt for them. Until very lately it has been very difficultg to decide where our lines are. My assistants are engaged in endeavoring to take a census. It is evident that with the refugees crowing upon us the task was temporarily impossible. We are hurrying them away under the instructions that came down fromMajor-General Sherman, and we could not tell wh actually were "residing within the jurisdiction of each provost-marshal. " I intend to have a perfect nominal list of every adult person belonging within my lines. I have been in the service since April16, 1861, from Washington to Saint Augustine, Fla., in each State, and have [never] seen a population more entirely quiet, under all the circumstances. My chief anxieties, outside of the regular military superivision of the district, are about the outsiders-the men who get passes from the North and come down here to buy or cover up property, or in some way defraud the Government. I have organized no military commission yet, having no criminals, except half a dozen marauding negroes, who need that discipline. As soon as I find three officers who can be spared for a few days I will detail them as a commission. Smithville is perfectly quiet and orderly; alltake the oath and behave themselves. Captain Sheppard, commanding post, makes everybody work at something or other and has put the place in very good order. I shall have to enlarge the garrison a litte, if the hospital is to go there, and throw up light intrenchments outside of the village.

Third. Section V and the requirements concerning commercial intercourse: I can say unhesitatingly that the provisions of Section V have been rigidly enforced, according to my best knowledge and ability. Small traders within the town were permitted to open their shops and sell their stocks on hand, lawfully held in accordance with orders. Under the late orders of Lieutenant-General Grant I have forbidden the carrying out of any supplies whatevera and endeavored to keep everything within our lines. Where those lines are, on the north and northwest, up toward Black River, it was difficult to say for a time. I now call the Northeast River my line of actual occupation in that direction. As to permission to bring goods here for sale, every case has been rigidly scrutinized and the professional opinions of the Treasury agents taken and all their regulations complied with. Some applications were made to and approved by Major-Generals Schofield and Terry that I had no record. In consulation with the Treasury agents I endeavored to estimate the necessary trade and governed myself by that estimate. Findig that some previous appicants were bringing in their stocks I cut off all grants. If, in consequence of the army's moving, or its inability to get these goods up for its use, the market should be a little overstocked, the loyal people of the district would have the benefit of a falling market. I think we can prevent any aid and comfort to the rebels. As a specimen of the temper of certain people I inclose a copy* of an application from J. D. Bellamy, which explains itself. Bellamy was a rapid secessionist here and tvrannized over all suspected of Unionism. He ran away, but only to get under the feet of General Sherman's forces. From a neighboring county he sends in this appeal. I have answered verbally that having for four years been making his bed, he now must lie on it or awhile. I have no time to take him within the lines.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOS. R. HAWLEY,

Brigadier General, Commanding, and Prov. March General, Dist. of Wilmington.
