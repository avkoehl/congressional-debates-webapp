HEADQUARTERS COLUMN FROM CALIFORNIA,Fort Barrett, Ariz. Ter., June 21, 1862.

Major THEODORE A. COULT,

Fifth Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding at Fort Barrett:

MAJOR: You will, without delay, move the troops of the Fifth Infantry California Volunteers to some suitable point on the left bank of the Gila River within a mile and a half of what is known as the Sacaton Station. Here you will, without delay, establish a defensive work large enough for a garrison of two companies, and of sufficient additonal capacity to hold store-houses for, say, 200,000 rations of subsistence stores. You will order Lieutenant Coleman, with Quartermaster-Sergeant Hutchinson, First Cavalry California Volunteers, and a guard suggicient to protect the public property which may then remain at and rear White's mill (the present Fort Barrett). Make arrangements with the chief quartermaster by which you will have three team sto keep your troops supplied with subistence from Fort Yuma, and one to be used for post purposes. This will do away with the necessity of your disturbing loads of subsistence stores in transit from Fort Yuma for Tuscon. I call your attention especially to this point, as such distrubance of loading is unauthorized and leads to great embarrassments. The four teams named include those you have now. Relieve at Blue Water Station, and order them to join their company, Corporal Crosson, and Privates Rader, Langdon, and Adle, of Company E, First Infantry California Volunteers. Send a non-commissioned officer and three men of the Fifth Infantry California Volunteers replace them.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES H. CARLETON,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army.
