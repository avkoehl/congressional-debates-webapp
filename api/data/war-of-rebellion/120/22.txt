HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI, INSPECTOR-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT,Saint Louis, Mo., April 7, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the Missouri:

MAJOR: The attention of the general commanding is called to the following extracts from letter of advice of Captain M. J. O'Connor, district inspector Saint Louis District, in regard to military hospitals:

The regimental surgeons in the city of Saint Louis complain, and justly too, that while the rebel prisoners in Gratiot Street Prison are provided with first-rate accommodations for bathing that our own men doing guard duty in the city have no such conveniences. I respectfully suggest that the medical director he instructed to give the matter his attention. The expense would be trifling. If it could not be done in any other way sufficient money might be drawn from the regimental fund of the different regiments to procure bath tubs, &amp;c.

Respectfully,

S. H. MELCHER,

Lieutenant-Colonel Sixth Cavalry Missouri State Militia.

Major General R. TAYLOR,

Commanding District of West Louisiana:

GENERAL: I am directed by the lieutenant-general commanding to inform you that the Federal prisoners to be exchanged will arrive at Marshall to-morrow. He has directed them to be halted there. It was his intention to have sent them down via Greenwood and Keatchie. Before sending them down he desires to know your wishes as to the best route to send them to prevent them from obtaining information or seeing anything. As the enemy will be able to arm the prisoners sent doubts the propriety of making the exchange until the present crisis has passed, and wishes your views.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. R. BOGGS,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
