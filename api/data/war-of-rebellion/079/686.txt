Major-General THOMAS:

Your dispatch of to-day just received. All right. I think Beauregard is checkmated. I will be all ready by the 10th instant. Will give you more positive notice in a day or two. I am glad General A. J. Smith is heard from. All men belonging to his two DIVISIONS that are not in hospital you will order in my name from Memphis. I would like to know, if possible, if Hood's whole army is at Tuscumbia or has gone toward Corinth.
