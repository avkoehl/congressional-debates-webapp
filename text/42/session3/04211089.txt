lieutenant to recruit for the forty-third regi-
ment Ohio volunteers, at the rate of fifteen
dollars per month, from and after the passage
of this act.
Mr. HOLMAN. This is a rather peculiar
bill in its phraseology. I infer that this lieu-
lieutenant was not in the serviveat all; that
he was simply appointed to recruit acompany.
If there is a report I ask that it may be read,
Mr. PECK. I ask the Clerk to read a state-
ment of the case, which he will find among
the papers accompanying the bill.
The statement was read, to the effect that
the husband of the petitioner had a recruiting
commission from the proper authorities, and
while recruiting men for the forty-third Ohio
volunteers he contracted a disease from which
he died ; that the evidence is ample that he
recruited men, that he contracted disease while
rceruiting, and died of the same, and^ that
information was furnished by the adjutant
general of Ohio.
Mr. HOLMAN. I do not think that under
the circumstances this bill should pass;
Mr. PECK. We have passed similar bills
in this House.
Mr. HOLMAN. But perhaps the attention
of the House was not called to them.
Mr. PECK. This bill is recommended
42  Cong. 3d Sess.—No. 69.
unanimously by the committee. However, I
am not very particular about it.
Mr. HOLMAN. I hope the gentleman will
allow me to move to recommit the bill. I
make that motion. •
Mr. PECK. I havcno objection.
The motion of Mr. Holman was agreed to;
and the bill was recommitted.
