brigade moved over and took up a position for the night, supported by Kimball's brigade. On the 20th we moved by a circuitous route about four miles to the left and took position on the right of Stanley. We fortified it on the 21st, the enemy falling back upon Atlanta during the night, and on the 22nd we moved and took up our last position in front of the city.

Casualties have been frequent during the last four days. Good works and obstructions were made here, and with the exception of almost daily demonstration with picket-lines and artillery, but little occurred to mention in this report, up to the 17th of August, when I turned the command of the brigade over to Colonel O. H. Payne, One hundred and twenty-fourth Ohio, and reported for duty in this army.

I now render my sincere thanks to all the officers and men of the brigade for their universal bravery and good conduct. Of my battalion commanders, Colonel Foy, now dead, was a brave and earnest man.

Colonels Payne, Berry, and Lieutenant-Colonel Kimberly have at all times shown such intelligence and zeal in the execution of duty as to deserve the highest consideration of the Government. My staff has always rendered my most efficient service. Lieutenant A. G. Bierce, my topographical officers, a fearless and trusty man, was severely wounded in the head before Kenesaw Mountain on the 23rd of June. Captain S. B. Eaton, One hundred and twenty-fourth Ohio Volunteers, of my staff, was severely wounded while assisting at the crossing of Peach Tree Creek, July 19. He is an officer of rare intelligence and merit.

Major McKeehan, of the Sixth Indiana Infantry, was wounded and captured on the 27th of May at the battle of Pickett's Mills, and afterward died in the hands of the enemy. His regiment could ill afford his loss.

Since the beginning of the campaign, May 3, to the time I relinquished command, the casualties of the brigade have been as follows:
