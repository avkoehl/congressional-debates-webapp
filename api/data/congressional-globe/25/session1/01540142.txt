Mi WISE I woa'd ask the gent eman if he
referred to me
Mr BYNUM. I do not recollect who it was,
but Í heard it
Mr. WISE I aever made such a statement
that he promised to pay m " gold alone."
Mr BYNUM I care not who made the
charge, but it must be in the recollection of the
House that the assertion was made that he had
given a promise to pay the members in gold, and I
appeal to the House to say whether I do not state
facts.
Mr B would now a«k the readng of a letter
from the Sergeant-at-Arms, m reply io one lie had
addrpssed to that officer, ca))mg upon him to state
the facts whethei the specie «as exhausted, and
whether any members had been denied being paid

W stated, m confirmation of this fact that Mr.
Halstead of New Jersey, made application to the
Sergeant-at-Arms for gold, and could not get it.
The Sergeant-at-arms refused it
Mr JOHNSON interposed, and said that, in
the remarks, he had made on this subject, he, in no
way, intended to impeach that officer, for a more
faithful, diligent, and honorable one they had never
had.
Mr WISE remarked that he did not design to
 mpeach the conduct of the Sergeant-at-Arms, and
that officer would not so understand him, but there
were a dozen members who could confirm what he
had stated Mr Dorsey had to pav out what
funds were m his possession, or he was supplied
with, and gold, at present, formed no pan of them
Let him a'so inform the House of another fact,
tnat the very specie they were then paid with, even
the silver, was the bank's specie, and not tne Go-
vernment's The Bank of the Metropolis had
loaned the Government some twenty or thirty thou-
sand dollars in specie for this purpose, for the Go-
vernment had neither gold nor suver of its own to
pay out
Mr BRIGGS inquired of the Chair what was
the question
The CHAIR stated it was on «he clause respect-
ing the item for an agent in London to prosecute
the Smithsonian bequest.
Mr BRIGGS expressed an earnest hope that
the commiltee would take the question There they
v. era at 10 o'clock of a Saturday night, on the last
night too of the session, with much important busi-
ness to act upen, wasting about tv, o hours on the
contemptible question, whether the Sergeant-af-
Arm  had gold or silver to pay the members' In
the name of heaven, he called upon the members
of that Hoiise t) continue this discussion n  fur-
ther, a disuasión, toge'her with Ike qiesnon in-
volved m it, of no consequence to any human being
on ei"th
While up, he must say, that the effort of his
fne id fiom Virginia, (Mr Wise) to fix any thing
wrong upon the Secretary of the Treasury, from
the reading of h s letter, did not meet Mr B's ap-
probation. The Secretary told t' e Clerk of the
House, that the members would be paid either m
notes of the city banks, or specie, or drafts upon
collectors or receivers, or deposite banks, m one or
the other, as should suit their convenience Now
he w >uld a'k the gentleman if it wis a fair con-
struction to saj that dns ^ as a piomise to paj in

Mr WHITTLESEY, o<" Ohio, called the gen-
tleman to old r, for irrelevancv
Mi BRIGGS I will come to ordci, sir, for I
am too well awaie of the utter irre'evancy of this
whole discussion, and being so, I stand cor-
rected
Mr HAWKINS begged leave to state what he
witnessed in relation to this matter, in the room of
the Sergeant-at-Arms
Mr CALHOUN of Massachuse'ts objected
Mi GLASCOCK hoped the gentleman from
Norlh Carolina would be allowed to go on, espe-
c ally as he «as a member who had nevei, in his
life, delayed the business of the House [Loud
and general cries of " go on"' " go on1"]
Mr HAWKINS then made a sla'ement substan-
tially as follows That he had stepped in the room
wheie the Seigeant-at-Arms was paung the mem-
bers, when he heard the member from Virginia
from the R chmond district, (Mr Robertson) ai-
plv to that officer to kno v in wha< k nd of currency
le intended to pay him Mr Dorsey observed
that he could pav h m n specie, and asked him
•«hat kind of money he vanted Mr Robertson
stated that he wished V rginia paper Mr Dorsey
spid he had not got Virginia papei but would try
and get it for him. One of Mr H's colleagues,
standing by said if Ml Dorsev would give him
specie for fifty dollars of United Stales Bank paper,
perhaps these notes would suit Mr R's conveni-
ence Mr Robertson said he would not take the
notes of the United States Bank, but would much
prefei Virginia bank paper to it
The amendment was then disagreed to.                    *
Mr. WISE then moved to amend the clause by
reducing the item for the expenses of the  agency       i
to London, to  attend to the Smithsonian bequest        j
from 10,000 to $5,000                                           '
Mr. CAMBRELENG said he had not the least
objection, because, if the larger sum was found to-
be requisite, it could be provided for next session.
The amendment was accordingly agreed to.
On motion of Mr. CAMBRELENG,the committee
then rose and reponed, and the amendment having
been concurred in, and then ordered to a third
reading, it was then read a  third time and passed.
The joint resolution of the Senate suspending the
rules which prohibit the transmission of bills from
one House to the other during the last three davs
of the session, and alse the presenting of bills to the
President within that time, was agreed to, after
amending it so as to except the divorce banks bill
from its operation, which was excepted, to on mo-
tion of Mr THOMPSON of South Carolina

SEMINOLE WAR.
On motion of Mr CAMBRELENG, the House
then again "b ent into Committee of the Whole on
the state of the Union, (Mr Brigos of Massachu-
setts, m the chair,) on the bill making appropria-
tions for the Seminole war.
The bill having been read through,
Mr. CAMBRELENG submitted a variety of
statements, showing the necessity of a furthpr cal
of $1,600,000, among which was the following let
ter from the Secretarj of War
War Department, Sept  14, 1837.
Sir- The Seminole Indians having a second
time failed to comply with then engagements, this
department has been compelled to make extensive
preparations for a vigorous prosecution of the war
in Florida The success of the measures adopted
by the Government, in pursuance of a humane
policv towards the Indians, and our duty to protect
the persons and property ol the citizens of that Ter-
ritory from outrage and violence, leave us no alter-
native other than the enforcement of the treaty,
and an effort is being made to enable the officer
charged with its execution, effectually to accom-
plish this object .The nature of the country and
of the climate, has enabled the enemy to prolong
this contest to an unexpected length, but the expe-
rience of the officers who, with so much constancy
and courage, have hitherto conducted the miltta'y
operations there, the knowledge of the country they
have acquired, and the means which will be placed
at their disposal, all give reasonab'e hopes of
bringing the war to a speedy and successful close.
The disastrous consequences of an unsuccessful
summer campaign involved the country in great
expenses, that were much increased during the
protracted negotiations which teimmated so unfor- f
tunately by the Indians again violating their treaty
obligations During this period, vessels were kept
m readiness at great cost, and other means pro- ,
vided to facilitate the emigration of the Indians,
while the ordinary expenses of the war establish-
ment w ere necessarily continued These unavoid-
able expenses, with those incurred by the prepara-
tions now making to collect a sufficient force and
ample supplies for the ensuing campaign, have ex-
hausted the means placed at the disposition of this
department for the suppression of Indian hostilities, ,
and wnl render further legislative provision ne-
cessarj
There will be required for the suppression of In-
dian hostilities, under the following heads, the sum     )
of §1,538,848 22, to wit
For forage, means of transportation, and various
other objects of supply, to be  proemed by the
