APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
28th Cong 1st Sess.
Appropriation Bill—Mr. Peyton.

H. of Reps.
Extract of a letter from Mr. Jefferson to Benjamin Jlus-
tin, dated January 9, 1816.
"We have since experienced what we did not then be-
lieve—that there exist both profligacy and power enough to
exclude us from the field of interchange with other nations;
that, to be independent for the comforts of life, we must
fabricate them ourselves. We must now place the manu-
facturer by the side of the agriculturist. The former ques-
tion is suppressed, or rather assumes a new form; the grand
inquiry now is, shall we make our own comforts, or go
•without them, at the will of a foreign nation? He, there-
fore, who is now against domestic manufacture, must be for
reducing us either to a dependence on that foreign nation, or
to be clothed in skins, and to live like \£ild beasts in dens
and caverns. I am proud to say I am not one of, these. Ex-
perience has taught me that manufactures are now as neces-
sary to our independence as to our comfort, and if those
who quote me as'of a different opinion will keep pace with
me in purchasing nothing foreign, where an equivalent of
domestic fabric can be obtained without any regard to dif-
ference of price, it will not be our fault if we do not have a
supply at home equal to our demand, and wrest that weapon
of distress from the hand which has so long wantonly vio-
lated it."
These are the opinions of the fathers of our institutions.
But his colleague (Mr. Andrew Johnson) in a speech made
in the House on the 22d of May, on the naval appropriation
bill, and reported in the Globe of that day, (see appendix,)
contended that the tariff is an oppressive and iniquitous
mode of taxation. He says the duty is always added to the
price of the article. If this were so, the price of the article
would be increased to the amount of the duty. Now for
the facts. 'Have prices risen since the passage of the tariff
of 1842? Here is a table, with some remarks by one of the
democratic members on this floor from Pennsylvania, [Mr.
Brodhead,] showing the effect of the tariff of 1842 upon
iron and coal, the greatstaple articles of that State:
Extract f rem a speech of Mr. Brodhead on the tariff, Jipril 27,
1844.
"I am prepared to show that the piice of coal and iron is
now less than it was before the passage of the act of 1842,
which increased the duty from $1 26 to $1 75 per ton on
coal, and on iron in about the same proportion."

"Now, sir, here are the prices at which it (coal) sold be-
fore and after the passage of the act of 1842, in the principal
markets:

"The same thing may bfc said in regard to iron and other
products of domestic manufacture. I have a table before
me, showing the prices ot iron from 1794 to the present
time, by which it appears that Pennsylvania iron was never
as- cheap as it is now. These statemsnts show that, m re-
gard to any production of industry, when the supply of the
raw material is ample, the ingenuity, industry, and enter-
prire of our people will, by the effects of domestic compe-
tition, bring down the price to the consumer to the lowest
point at which human labor can effect the object without
loss; and that very shortly after the dread of foreign m-
teilerence is taken away. The iron men of this country have
always had te contend with a heavy, and sometimes ruin-
ous competition, causedby the large amount of the poor Eng-
lish article brought into our markets. So, too, with our
mechanics. Our people engaged m the coal trade cannot
compete with the English and Welsh coal, if the duty is re-
duced nearly one-half, as is proposed by the present bill,
and will be obliged to resign our markets to foreigners;
and then the price will go up to eight or ten dollars per ton
again."
Mr. P. continued: Here is another {table, exhibited by
Mr. Bidlack', another democratic member from Pennsylva-
nia, in'his speech on the tariff, May 1,1844:
"The inexhaustible stores of iron and coal spread through-
out the vast expanse of this wide republic will always pre-
vent any danger of combinations among the domestic pro-
ducers to demand unfair prices from the community. The
present tariff may have lessened importations, and thereby
given a more extensive home market to our producers, and
thus opeiated to their advantage, but that it has not en-
hanced the prices, will appear from the following' extracts
from the commercial list of Mr. Childs:
"Turn to August, 1841 and 1842, and February, 1844, and
give us the prices of iron^at the said dates, respectively. I
have it, and answer as follows:
August 21, 1841—before the tariff.
$75 00 to $82 50 yer ton.
72 50 to 77 -00

"The two former dates show the prices of iron prior to
the commencement of the present tariff, and the latter date
shows the price now, while the tariff" is in full operation.
'The.result is, that iron is cheaper now than it was before
the present 'heavy duty' was laid upon it!"
Mr. P. said, this was good democratic proof that the tariff'
of 1842 had not increased the price of iron or coal. What
had been its effects upon other articles?

What, then, became of his colleague's theory, that the
duty is always added to the price? What became of his wild
calculations, that the tariff imposed a burden of many mil-
lions of dollars upon the American people, and near $100,-
000 annually upon the people of Tennessee. Mr. P. said,
that the impression had heretofore prevailed that figures
could not lie. He greatly feared that the calculations of
modern democracy had §one very far to bring figures into
dis repute, and to undermine the broad basis of mathematics
itself. His colleague had said, if laying on heavy duties
will bring down the price of manufactures, increase them,
and the manufacturer would finally, under this process,
have to sell his goods for nothing. Mr. P. said this was not
the first instance oi the absurd conclusions of the syllogis-
tic mode of reasoning. By assuming false premises you
can prove anything. An enemy to our institutions might
say that General Washington was a great tyrant; that all
tyrants ought to be beheaded: therefore, General Washing-
ton ought to have been beheaded. But, since his colleague
seemed to be found of this made of reasoning, he whould
give him a specimen in his own vein. He is opposed to
the tariff—thinks that, the lower the duty the lower the
the price of goods. Then, sir, you have nothing to do but to
keep lowering the duty until you come down to the free
trade point, and yet get the goods for nothing. Mr. P. said,
it was a bad rule that would not .work both ways; and thus,
he met one absurdity with another. Mr. P. said, it wab the
competition between our own manufacturers, and between
them and the manufacturers abroad, that brought down the
price of goods. It was one of the happy effects of this pol-
icy, (the tariff,) that while it brought down the price of
goods to the consumer, it afforded a home market forour
agricultural productions more valuable than all the markets
of the world put together, and thiew a shield around our
domestic labor against the pauper labor of Europe. Would
his colleague bring down the honest, independent mechanic
of our country to a level with the halt-clothed, half-fed
paupers of England, France, and Germany, where there is a
perpetual struggle to keep starvation from the door? Sup-
pose he strikes down the tariff, and lets the products of
this kind of labor in our country: would he not compel
our mechanic at once to sell the products of his labor
as cheap as they do? And if he sells as cheap, must he
not live as cheap? Would he be willing to reduce
the proud, the free mechanic of this country to such
a fate? Would he have him to lie on a bed of straw, ordirt
floor—work 16 hours a day for 8 or 10 cents—and see his
little shivering, ragged children around him, crying and
starving for bread? Unless he is prepared for this, let him
not be willing to remove all protection from American
labor, for it must follow, "as the night the day," if the tariff'
is destroyed, and free trade introduced in its stead, our me-
chanics must be borne down and ruined by this.pauper coHi-
petition of Europe. Mr. here exhibited a table of the wages
of labor in Europe, as follows:

Would his colleague be willing to see the tailors strug-
gling against such com petition as this? In his speech, tne
other day, he took occasion to allude to the circumstance oi
his connection withjthat class of mechanics: and here (Mr.
P. said) he took great pleasure in bearing his humble testis
mony of the respectability of that class of the mechanics oi
oar country. He numbered many of them in his district
among his warm personal and political friends; and there
was no part of the community more honest or more intelli-
gent. Ifhis colleague should succeed in breaking down tno
tariff', and letting m that flood of goods of every description
that would rush m from England, France, and Germany,
what woulS become of the tailors? Would not every City,
town, village, and hamlet in this country be packed wita.
ready-made clothing from cellar to rafters'* Could our
tailors sell their labor at these reduced prices? 3no. What
would they do, then7 They would be compelled to give up
their business- They would be turned out of house and
home, to wander about, dependent upon the cold charity of
of the world, or to learn new trades, perhaps in their old
age, and for which their previous habits totally disqualified
them. Such would be the inevitable effect of this system ot
free trade and direct taxation upon the mechanics of our
country. As he had observed, the fathers of our republic
thought very differently from his colleague; they thought
that our farmers, our mechanics, and manufacturers should
be protected, sustained, and made independent of the whole
world. They set this great protective system ill motion.
It has been in operation for more than fifty years—and wnat
has been the result? Are there any privileged classes, any
distinctions, any aristocracy here? None, none whatever.
We all stand on one common level—mechanic and pro-
fessional man; and there is no passport to favor, affection,
or distinction, but that which is won by honesty, ln-
tegritv, and talent. Our glorious ancestors acknowl-
edged no distinctions i all classes put their shoulders to
the revolutionary wheel, and none pushed harder, or with
more effect, than did the shoemaker, the wagoner, the black-
smith, and the printer, in the persons of the illustrious Sher-
man Morgan, Greene, and Franklin. His colleague was
himself a strong illustration of the excellence of our insti-
tutions, and the happy results of that policy which our fa-
thers taught and practised He, sir, has thrown aside his
shears, his thimble, and his goose, and occupies a seat on
this floor—one ot the proudest stations that the ambition of
man can aspire to. This reflected infinite credit upon him
and the institutions of our beloved country; but he regret-
ted that his colleague was so much mistaken in his duty
(honestly no doubt) to the honorable calling to which he
belongs, as to recommend a policy that would inevitably
reduce the free and independent mechanics of this country
to a level with the paupers of Europe.
His colleague had favored the House (m his speech on the
naval appropriation bill) with a labored argument m favor
of direct taxation, though he disclaimed being an advocate
of it. In that speech he pointed out the man} evils that
would be avoided, and blessings secured to the country,
anl partculariy of Tennessee, by a system of direct taxa-
tion He had long since thought he could perceive a set-
tled design, on the part of the leaders of modem democracy,
to saddle this odious system on this country whenever
they should think that it was safe to make the attempt.
As an eveidence that every quarter of the country was
tilled with democratic advocates of this doctrine, he would
read an extract from a speech of Mr. J.T. Stuart, of llli-
noK on the tariff, July, 1812, and published m the
Appendix to the Congressional Globe, pages S61, 862:
'■DuiinK the progress of this debate, however, there has
been much to induce the apprehension that it is seriously
contemplated by tlic democratic party to carrv this odioui
svstem into practice whenever they mav hase the power of
dome so. It has been advocated by the gentlemen from
South Carolina, [Messrs. Rhett and Pickf.ns,] by the mem-
ber from North Carolina., [Mr. Daniel,] by the member fropt
