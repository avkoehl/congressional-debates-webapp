Report of Captain John S. Mosby, Virginia Cavalry.

NEAR UPPERVILLE,

March 3, 1863.

GENERAL: Yesterday a Yankee cavalry force of about 400 men came up to Middleburg. As soon as I heard of it I hastily collected together 17 of my men and started in pursuit, having in the meantime ascertained that they had gone back. At Aldie I overtook their rear squadron, of 59 men, which I charged and routed, capturing 2 captains and 17 men, together with their arms; also 23 horses and accouterments. Two of my men were slightly wounded. I have sent all the prisoners but 2 on to Culpeper Court-House. A wounded captain was paroled.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. S. MOSBY.
