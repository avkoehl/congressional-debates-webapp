GRADUATION OF THE PRICL Or PUBLIC IANDS
Oa motion of Mr. WALKER, the Senate resum-

redaction and graduation ol the price of the public
lands, tne question being on the substitute proposed
by the Committee on Public L ¡rids, «hen

lines were run, thus taking every part of the sec-
tion. He would appeal to the Senator from Ten-
nessee whether he would not rely on such field
notes, sworfi to by the deputy surveyor and the
chain carriers, where it tvas shown that in all
these lines there was nothing but pine barrens and
fourtli la'e lands In Mississippi and Alabama the
Senator would find that entire counties and dis-
rlcts were thus returned In nine cases out of ten
the field notes would be the correct criterion to
judge by. As regarded the expense, he thought the
objection riot a sound one. In such districts as he
had referred to, the Register and Receiver referring
only to the field notes, no expense would be m-
\oi«-ed But «here the district varied m value,
and «here the Meld notes afforded no criterion,
then they would resort to inspection, Besides, it
only cost four dollars a mile to survev, and the m-
-pection could not come to any thing like that. He
ventured to assert that the expense of inspection
would not be one-eighth of one per cent, pjr mile.
Mr GRUNDY Was nrt satisfied with the ex-
planation of the Senator fiom Mississippi, and
maintained, that if a satisfactory survey w re
made the cost would be much greater than was re-
presented Mr. G contended) that in many sec-
tions field notes weie deceptive, and instanced Ar
kanstts and others, where the true value could
only be asceftamed from consultation with persons
residing at or near the premises. The only question
to be decided was, whether the Senator would take the
proposition offered by the committee, or the amend-
ment, offered by himself, which he thought he had
shown to be liable to less objection
Mi SEVIER greatly preferred the amendment
of the S nator from Tennessee to that of the com-
mittee, on account ot its simplicity and economy,
as well as greater cenamty of obtaining a correct
valuation. He had no doubt but the lines run by
Ihe sitivpyors, pit I their held notes, were correctas

a enntbiakc, the land over whioh he passed might
be worthless, while twenty yards to his right or left,
wheic he could not see, the soil might be of the best
quality He had seen land described in these field
nolo as of great value, which was of the worst qua-
lity while, on the other hand, he had known the
V( ry best lands to be set down as woilhless. Mr
Mr S objected to the plan ot personal inspection
proposed by the committee, as leading to a great
and useless expense This inspection, he said, was

by bung paid by the day—say fiom five to eight
dollars, which was the general compensation for
similat services—would find it their interest to be

Mi CLAY of Alabama remaiked, that haiing
hid, as a membei of the Committee en the Public
Lands, something to do wnh bringing in this
amendu cut, he wished to set the Senator from Ten-
nessee a'd others light with legird to it The Se-
mtoi tieatedthe amendment of the committee as if
it umntiicd nothing as to the deteimination of the
vilue oí the lands but the field notes of the sur-
veyors Now, it the Senator had read 'he bill at-
tentively, he would have found that the field notes
were resided as one ot the criteria only, and that
the value of the land as to its location, together
wiili the lime that it had been in the market, were
also looked to. He «asfully convinced that there
was no certain way of ascertaining the precise
lalue of the land, but by actual inspection, but to
asie.tam it m that way would be so expensive that
cveiy member of the Senate woul 1 be opposed to
11 It casting about for other means of coming at
this valae, consistent with economy and conve-
nience, the committee adopted the three considera-
tions of the locality of the tract, the time it had
been in the market, and the opinion of the land of-
293
fleers, founded upon the field notes, <md the r «« n
inspection when necessary. He cotiM nut agree-
with the Senator from Arkansas, that tbeííe'd notes
were so hule to be relied upon It was not to be
presumed that the surveyor, in running his 'til's,
could not see sufficiently to the light and lilt to
form apiobably correct judgment as to the quality
of the section. He runs the exterior lines of the
section, and is required by law to put down a half
mile stake. It was true that the character of the
soil and the timber often changed within half a mile;
but this seldom occurred where the surveyor did
not observe it But the locality of the tract was an
important principle for ascertaining its value. The
proximity to a navigable stream, or to a town,
would render land more valuablt than that of the
same quality, as to soil, which was not so advan-
tageously situated But the Senator yvoulc' ob-
serve, that with all these considerations, no land
crold be reduced in pnt e until it had been offered
first four years at one dollar and twenty five cents
per acre. Secondly, it mu't be offered four year 
at one dollar per acre, before it could be reduced
to seventy-five rents, and soon, always giving a
sufficient time to sell, if worth the price He agreed
that the taking the time the lands had been in the
market as the mode of valuing them, something
like the plan of the Senator from Tennessee, would,
under all the circumstances, be more likely to do
justice to the Government, but, like his fiiendfrom
Arkansas, he was willing to take cither plan that
a majority of the Senate preferred.
Mr. CLAY of Kentucky had an utter aversion
to reducing the puce of the public land, which is
already low enough, or mteifering wiih a system
which had worked well for so long a period It
could easily be shown that the contemplated reduc-
tion ought not to be made, and that all the tests ot
value were merely fallacious Tnis was all he
would say at the pic ent, indisposed as he was
The question might be taken on the amendment
offered by the Senator from Tennessee, hut he gave
notice that he would, at another time, express his
views at largcotipon that interesting topic, anel
should oppose boih amendment and original bill.
Mr GRUNDY said the Senator from Kentucky
was averse to the whole system ot graduation,
and would oppose it any how, so that taking the
question on the adoption of the amendment, was a
matter of little consequence, so fai as he \tas
concerned He [Mr G ] was for rtducmg the
price of the public lanels, and would prefer the
question on his amendment to be taken, and,
whether it should be adopted or lost, the Senator
would still have an opportunity of giving his views
to the Senate.
The question was then taken on Mr Grundy's
amendment, and it was agited to, and it being, by
geneial consent, considered as the original text,
Mr NILES moved an amendment, to extend the
time from five 10 eight yeais for the reduction of ihe
price to one dollar per acre, and from ten to twelve
years tor the redaction to seventy-five cents per
acie, and to strike out that part of the bill which re-
duced the land to fifty cents peí acre.
Mi. N said he did not intend to go into a gene-
ral discussion of the bill, or the giaduatmg princi-
ple. By adopting the amendment of Ihe Senator
from Tennessee, [Mr. Grundy,] we have decided
that the true test lor a reduction of the price of the
public land is the time it has been in market. This
he considered correct, although he was sensible
that a \aluation might, m some cpses, afford an ad-
ditional security, but he thought a valuation and
classification of the public lands would be attene'ed
with considerable expense, and amount to but little,
as respects the object in view The time the lands
have been m market he regarded as the most s-a'e
test, as it depended on the vigtlance of individuals,
whose sagacity, brought into action by private inte-
rest, would hardly fail of causing the public lands
to be purchased or entered, in the older of time,
according with their quality. The time that lands
have been in market being adopted as the only test
to determine •«hat lands are of such inferior quali-
ty that thg price ought to be reduced, the question is
how long a period ought to be considered as suffi-
cient to establish the fact The bill proposed four
years, and the amendment of the Senator from
