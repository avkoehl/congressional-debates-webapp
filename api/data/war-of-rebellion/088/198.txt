taken off, but the trail is broken. I don't know that any more will be gotten off. General Gregg has found the enemy intrenched on the Charles City road at White's house. Their people came out of their intrenchments and attacked, but I do not think they have much strength there. I expect to feel along with my infantry to the Charles City Cross-Road, if I do not sooner find a place to attack.

General GRANT:

General Gregg says that the enemy are making a spirited attack upon him down the Charles City road. They drove him out of the intrenchments he took from them yesterday. He has taken a prisoner, who says that there was a large force of cavalry, with infantry, on that road this morning, six miles this side of Richmond. General Gregg thinks that Hampton has joined. We have no positive evidence of it. My brigade of infantry that went from the Central road to strike the Charles City road met the enemy very soon, supposed to be infantry, and repulsed them. Another brigade has been added to it, and General Birney will attack them very soon. A knapsack was fished up this morning during the cavalry fight marked Thirteenth Georgia, Willcox's division, and also, I think, Hagan's [Hagood's] brigade.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,August 15, 1864.

General GRANT:

I have just taken a staff officer of General Barringer, commanding brigade of cavalry in W. H. F. Lee's division. The command came over, I don't know in what strength, last night. Have also captured a private of Third Division Cavalry, and an officer of the Forty-eighth Alabama. I am sending some infantry to strike the Charles City road to take this cavalry in flank; am also sending some infantry to Gregg to the junction of the Charles City road with the Long Bridge. General Birney is also feeling around the enemy's right of where Barlow attacked yesterday.
