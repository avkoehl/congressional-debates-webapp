No. 157. Reports of Colonel Montgomery D. Corse, Seventeenth Virginia Infantry commanding brigade, Kemper's division, of the battles of Groveton and Manassas.
HEADQUARTERS KEMPER'S BRIGADE,September --, 1862.

GENERAL: I submit the following report of the operations of Kemper's brigade, which I had the honor to command, during the battles of Groveton, August 29, and Manassas No. 2, August 30:

On the morning of the 29th this brigade marched with the others of your command from its bivouac near Thoroughfare Gap, and halted about 3 miles east of Gainesville about 12 o'clock. we were at once placed in line of battle in rear of Jenkins' brigade near the Manassas Gap Railroad. After remaining in this position for a short time the brigade moved forward east of the railroad. The Twenty-fourth Virginia was here detached and sent to support Rogers' battery, stationed near the ---- house. The rest of the brigade, by your order, was then moved west of the railroad, forming line of battle a few yards from the outskirts of a wood. The Seventh Virginia went forward in skirmishing order across a field some 300 yards to the front. In the last movement the brigade was subjected to a heavy shelling from a battery of the enemy distant about 1,200 yards. Remaining in this position for half an hour, I received through your assistant adjutant-general (Captain [W. T.] Fry) an order to move forward and to the right, to withdraw the Seventh, connect in with my line, and occupy a wood in front distant 400 yards. In obeying this order the brigade was forced to move in full view of the above-mentioned battery, which kept a constant fire upon us. Nothing daunted, however, the line e moved steadily forward and took the position designated. I threw out Captain [R. H.] Simpson's company (Seventeenth Regiment) as skirmishers to the front and right. In a short time he encountered the enemy's skirmishers on our right and in rear of our line. Not being aware that any of our troops were on my right, and seeing the enemy a few moments before display a considerable force in front, which at once moved to the right
