that there was no serious outbreak. Before leaving here I telegraphed to Governor Yates to communicate with me at Terre Haute, but got no reply from him.

The next morning a little before daylight I took a freight train and reached Paris at 8 a. m. on the 4th of March. I immediately put myself in communication with some Union persons to whom I had been referred and learned substantially what had been told me at Terre Haute.

I again telegraphed to the Governor inquiring what he wished done. I soon after got answer to my first telegram through Terre Haute.

At 3 p. m. on the 4th Captain Hill, with sixty men of the Invalid Corps, arrived from Chicago. I quartered them in the court-house. An hour later got a telegram from Governor Yates that Colonel Oakes was on his way to Paris. In the night Colonel Oakes arrived. At 2.50 p. m. on the 5th some forty more men arrived from Springfield. I left in the same train for my headquarters. As Lieutenant-Colonel Oakes" services are indispensable for the draft, I ordered him to return to Springfield in the next train. The troops under Captain Hill will remain at Paris for the present.

I procured a statement of the different officers and of the condition of the disloyals and inclose them with copies of all telegrams receive and sent.*

This man Johnson is said by some to be an escaped prisoner of war from Camp Chase and under an assumed name. If I can trace him and find this true, I will direct the arrest of a few of the most trouble-some in the vicinity of Paris, which would aid in quieting this ill-feeling. I think it advisable that the troops now there should remain for the present.

In inclose descriptions of the last affair; cut one from the loyal the other from the disloyal paper of the town.*

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. P. HEINTZELMAM,

Major-General.

PHILADELPHIA, PA., April 8, 1864.

I hereby certify that the city of Philadelphia has paid relief to families of residents of the city mustered into the service from May, 1861, to July 1, 1863, as follows:

Men mustered for three years............................ 16,035

Men mustered for two years.............................. 79

Men mustered for one year............................... 41

------

Total................................................... 16,155

this relief is only given when volunteers in service have left families who were dependent upon them. I have served as secretary to the commission for distributing this relief from its organization, April 26, 1861, until the present time, and from my observation I know that considerably less than one-half of the volunteers from this city have had families who have applied for this relief.

SAMUEL C. DAWSON,

Secretary.
