Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION,Petersburg, Va., August 14, 1864.

COLONEL: Picket and mortar fire has been about as brisk as usual during the past twenty-four hours. Colonel Goode, commanding Wise's brigade, ordered his pickets to fire by volley several times last night in order to draw the fire of the enemy and judge of their strength. The fire of the enemy was drawn, but did not seem so strong as ours. General Gracie thinks the enemy have removed some of their mortars, or at least do not reply as formerly. The rumbling of wagons was also heard in front of his line last night. The enemy have placed palisades in front of their lines opposite to Ransom's brigade.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted; Gracie's brigade, killed, 1; wounded, 3. Elliott's brigade, wounded, 1. Ransom's brigade, wounded, 3 (1 mortally). Wise's brigade, killed, 1; wounded 1. Total 2 killed, 8 wounded.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

COLONEL: Brigade commanders, especially of Elliott's and Ransom's brigades, are using every effort to discover the mines of the enemy, if they have any; but so far their efforts have been unsuccessful. Colonel McAfee, commanding Ransom's brigade, reports that he cannot draw the water from the artisan holes with the pipes, as one is too short and two are too long. He suggests that gutta-percha pipes be furnished. The picket-fire was quite weak yesterday, but last night became more brisk and rapid than usual. General Gracie reports the rumbling of wagons last night. No change in the strength or position of the enemy has been observed.
