We had a very fine glass (captured from the Federal Army), with which we could look into the streets of Winchester. No force can leave Winchester or go to Strasburg, Front Royal, Ashby's Gap, or Snicker's Chester or go to Strasburg, Front Royal, Ashby's Gap, or Snicker's Gap, or in any direction, without being seen, except at night or rainy weather. We were on post from 8 a. m. until 3 p. m. Usually we boarded with Mr. Bruash Mackintosh, near the signal station. My companion will think that I am captured, as I told him I was going on a scout. There is a chain of signal stations, all connecting with New Market, from which place a telegraph goes to General Early's headquarters. There is a station on the mountain at Ashby's Gap; one at Hominy Hollow, on Bock's Hill, near Front Royal; one at Burnt Springs, on Fort Mountain, opposite Honeyville, at Ed. Brownman's, between
