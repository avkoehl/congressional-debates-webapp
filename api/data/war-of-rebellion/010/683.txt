possible. The loss of the brigade in taking and holding the bridge was 3 killed and 20 wounded, as per list.

Lieutenant-Colonel Hanson and Major Buckner, Twentieth Kentucky Volunteers, and Captain Baldwin, Second Kentucky, and his company, and the officers and men of the Twentieth Kentucky Regiment, were conspicuous.

Captain Wheeler, of the Twenty-fourth Ohio, on Colonel Ammen's staff, was, as he always is under fire, conspicuous for his gallantry. During the night dug rifle pits all along the new line.

On the morning of the 30th the division entered Corinth, as I have reported on a former occasion. I have to regret the loss of the services of one of the best officers of my division, namely, Captain Erwin, Sixth Ohio Volunteers, who was shot through the chest at 6 o'clock by the last fire of the enemy's picket as we were moving into the lines of Corinth. The cavalry of my division ran onto the enemy's rear about 3 1/2 miles beyond Corinth. I sent a note to the general asking permission to attack the enemy, which the general decline to give. The division returned to camp. It performed one tour of duty in Corinth, and June 4 marched on the Rienzi road to Smith's Cross-Roads, where we arrived on June 7; thence we marched on the 9th to Iuka, where we arrived on the 11th.

The division in the skirmishing near Corinth lost 4 killed and 58 wounded, as per list, 5 of whom were mortally wounded and have since died.*

Very respectfully,

WM. NELSON,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel J. B. FRY,

Chief of Staff.
