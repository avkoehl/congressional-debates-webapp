Brigadier General S. S. FRY,

Camp Nelson, Ky.:

I have reliable information from different sources that no rebels were at Richmond this morning. My impression is their main force is at or near Winchester, intending an attack here or at Camp Nelson to-morrow. Please answer.

Governor O. P. MORTON,

Indianapolis, Ind.:

General Fry telegraphs from Camp Nelson that rebels were at Richmond 2 o'clock this morning. Reliable information placed their force when at Whitesburg at 2,500; the same force reported over 2,000 strong when at Booneville. General Fry thinks they will move south through Crab Orchard.

Adjt. General John BOYLE,

News this morning indicates the intention of the rebels to attack Camp Nelson. Preparations complete to defend it and the fort at this place. I think the main rebel forces moving toward Camp Nelson from Mount Sterling.

Colonel I. GARRARD,

Nicholasville, Ky.:

General Hobson telegraphs from Covington, noon to-day--

Look for Lexington. Let Colonel Garrard know what is doing and direct him to get arms for Camp Nelson if he needs them for Seventh Ohio. I want Lexington to resist anything that comes against it.

General Hobson also says a force is reported moving from Richmond. He hears nothing from General Burbridge. I have ordered the Thirteenth Kentucky Cavalry to move from Burkesville, via Lebanon, to Camp Nelson. Have not heard from our troops at Irvine yet.

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
