Brigadier General P. E. CONNOR,Denver:

The commanding officer of Sixteenth Kansas Cavalry should be brought to account for his delay. It is near two months since he left Fort Leavenworth, time enough to walk to Kearny and return twice.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI, Saint Louis, April 6, 1865-2. 45 p. m.

Brigadier-General CONNOR,Denver:

I have ordered the engineers on plains from my headquarters to report to you for approval of their plans. In selecting post at Julesburg, which I think must be an important depot, great care should be had that the right plan is selected; also give instructions at Cottonwood about that post as you deem best. I think an order has been reissued to move the stage station. I do not know as it is necessary; you have been there and are the judge. How are you off for supplies? Don't let us get behindhand.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
