I cannot speak too highly of the conduct of my staff. Through the exertions of Captains Dunbar (assistant quartermaster) and Brookfield (commissary of subsistence) my command has always been well supplied. Doctor Wise (surgeon-in-chief of division), Captains Brink (inspector-General), Day (provost-marshal), and my aides, Captain Hayes and Lieutenants Hollingsworth, Oliver, Fuller, and Griffin, have each, in their respective places, more than fulfilled my expectations. Captain Estes, my assistant adjutant-General, deserves special notice, not only for the faithful discharge of his eminent duties but for his reckless daring and invaluable assistance in every skirmish and engagement. This officer deserves and I earnestly hope that he may be promoted.

Accompanying this report will be found a nominal list of killed, wounded, and missing*, also provost-marshal's statement of captures and property destroyed. I also inclose the reports of my brigade and regimental commanders, which I respectfully request may be taken as part of this my official report.

Respectfully submitted.

J. KILPATRICK,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Cavalry.

E. B. BEAUMONT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps.
