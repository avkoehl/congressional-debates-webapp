WHITE HOUSE, June 5, 1863-10. 30 a. m. (Received 11 a. m.)

Major-General ELZEY,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: The enemy have landed from three transports and one gunboat at Walkerton, and have crossed over into King William, to Ward`s and near to the Piping Tree. I have sent Major [John R.] Bagby, with about 100 infantry, one section of artillery, and Capps` and Williams` cavalry (two companies) over, below the enemy, in King William. Have ordered Colonel J. T. Goode to bring up four companies of infantry from New Kent Court-House. I am here with a small guard of infantry, and Colonel [W. P.] Shingler at Tunstall`s with a small guard of cavalry. If you can, send some forces to the Piping Tree, on this side; the enemy are burning houses in that vicinity.

HENRY A. WISE,

Brigadier-General.

WHITE HOUSE, June 5, 1863.

Major-General ELZEY:

GENERAL: If all my forces are kept on this side of the Pamunkey, they cannot take care of the enemy who have landed on the other side the Mattapony. Major Bagby is not at Frazer`s Ferry, but at Lanesville, in King William, only 3 miles from White House. I have already countermanded all the orders extending my force below, and have ordered Colonel Goode with the Fourth {Virginia Heavy Artillery] up to this place, and will move with a portion of it up to Piping Tree. Shall I recall Major Bagby?

HENRY A. WISE,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF RICHMOND, June 5, 1863.

Brigadier-General PETTIGREW,Commanding Hanover Junction:

GENERAL: The President desires you to communicate by courier with General Pickett, informing him of the enemy having landed at Walkerton and burning houses in King William. He wants the enemy captured or destroyed, if possible, and thinks if General Pickett will move or send a force rapidly to Walkerton or below it, with some artillery, and you send some down, the combined movement with Wise from White House would do the business.

ARNOLD ELZEY,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF RICHMOND, June 5, 1863.

Brigadier-General WISE,

Commanding White House, &c.:

GENERAL: I thought you said the enemy were in King William, this side of the Mattapony, near Piping Tree. Leave Major Bagby on the other side to co-operate with you, and exercise your judgment
