HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, October 22, 1864.

Major-General WARREN:

GENERAL: In view of our conversation this morning, I would like to know the number of men and guns it will require to hold the line of redoubts and inclosed batteries now held by your corps, including the minimum picket-line, which should be furnished as far as practicable from the garrisons of the works. It will probably be necessary to have a picket-line the whole front, who in case of being driven in could garrison the redoubts and more adjacent parts of the rifle trenches. In addition to the above, please let me know how many guns and men will be left available for other operations.

Respectfully,GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
