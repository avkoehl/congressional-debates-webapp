Major-General SHERIDAN,

Charlestown, Va.:

In clearing out the arms-beaning community of London County, and the subsistence for armies, exercise your own judgment as to who should be exempt from arrest, and as to who should received pay for their stock, grain, &amp;c. It is our interest that country should not be capable of subsisting a hostile army, and a the same time we want to inflict hardship upon Union men as possible.

Yesterday evening, just before dark, Kershew's division attacked Crook on the Berryville pike, and was handsomely repulsed, with a loss of 50 prisoners and over 200 killed and wounded. To-day has been spent on both sides without any results. The indications look to an engagement to-morrow.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Commanding Middle Military Division, Charlestown, W. Va.:

A scout of mine came in last night from Gordonsville, which place he left the 1st instant. Early's troops commenced passing through that place on their return to Richmond on the 28th ultimo, and were still passing through when he left. He says that Early was at Gordonsville, ant that all his force, except 20,000, under Breckinridge, are to return to Richmond, Breckinridge has orders to hold the Valley as long as he can. The rebels are to make a desperate attempt to recover the Weldon road. I regard this information as reliable.

Major-General.
