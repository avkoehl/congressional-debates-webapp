Resolved, That the thanks of the General Assembly of the State of Rhode Island are hereby tendered to Major General Philip H.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CAMDEN STATION, Baltimore, February 14, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

It is my duty again to report that twenty rebels came in last night at the same place, three miles west of Harper's Ferry, and captured and robbed one of our watchmen. Another of our watchmen, fortunately, succeeded in escaping, and went back in time to warn and stop the trains, and thus prevented their destruction. I fear your suggestions have not received attention regarding the proper protection of this important portion of our line.

J. W. GARRETT,

President.
