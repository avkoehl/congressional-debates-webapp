" appears to have been made outside of the Mada-
waska settlement, upon contiguous waste lands "
And hence he adds
" Whatever jurisdiction the Government of New Brunswick
might claim in virtue of the MadawasLa settlement!, being ton
fined to it, could not be rightfully extended to Baker tnd hia
American neighbors Kven if he had been guilty of any menu
larity of conduct, he «as not amenable to the I'rovinual 0.0
veinment, but to his own '
Thus we see, that while Mr Clay was denying
the right of the British Government to tij and
punish Baker, inasmuch,as he lived out of Jilada-
leaska settlement, on the unoccupied «isle, Mr
Livingston was denying their right to try and punish
Wheelock for an act done in the settlement of -Va-
dawaska itself. This is manifestly higher ground
than that assumed by Mr, Clay, and >et my col-
league can see in the course ol the former eveiy
thing to praise, and in the latter eteiy thing lo
condemn.
In the case of Greely, howevei, Mr Steven^n
is complimented for the bo'd and manly lone m
which he denounced the arrest of Greely ai an
outrage, demanded his ukase, and denied the juns-
diction of the British Government Sir, I am glad
that this Admmistrauon, or any one of its members,
cao perform any act in a mannei lo please my
colleague But, he adds, Mr Stevenson assumed
it upon his own responsibility, not having leceived
instructions from this Government ot a similar
character
To this, I can make no more effectual answer
than to turn to the letlei ol nisti notions itst.ll, liom
Mr Forsyth to Mi Stevenson, undei date ot July
12, 1837 1 heie find that he expressly o-ills tilt
seuuie and imprisonment an "oí ikagí. upon the
personal itDeiit/" ol one ot the citi/eus ot Maine,
and, after duelling briefly upon die argument ol
the case, he closer by saying "You are directed,
immediately upon the receipt of this despatch, to
bring the subject to the notice ol his Majesty's Go-
vernment, and to dímanb, as a matter ol jusii«<
and right, trie prompt téleme of Mr. Greely, and a
mtiable indemnity for his imprisonment." Our incli-
nations must havo become belligerent, indeed, it we
would require any thing more than this, and one
■would naturally think, that the materials lor fault-
finding were very scarce, when such circumstances
are seized upon as matters ol giave amtsatnm
against the Administration
But it is said, fuithci, thit ine British Gi vein-
ment has acquncd posees ion oí the dispuu ' tim
tory b) means ot a «arden, and thai this u irdtn
was appointed with the knowledge anuconcuriince
of President Jackson Whcie is the evidence oí
thisi None is to be found exupt m a letter Irom
Sir Archibald Campbell to Sir ( liarles It Vaughon,
January 20, 1834, in which he says "Mr
McLaughlan wa  appointed to the «ardenship oí
the country with the knowledge and concunence of
the President, and it is not conceived, there (ore,
that any fan ground ol objection can be taken to
his faithful performance ot the dutiet ol his olfice "
It will be observed, that he does not allege that
President Jackson concuned m the appointment,
and fiom the infoimation to be gathered from Uie
documents, it ts mamlest in it it tottld not have
been him, lor the appointment was made belore lie
came into office By the fo)tgoin6 letter oi Sir
Archibald Campbell, we learn that the name of the
warden is McLauohlan, and o. turning back to a
letter from Sir Howard Douglass to Mi Vittghan,
dated Febiuaiy 11, 1829, we snalt imd the follow-
ing in relation lo this gentleman and hi., appoint
ment
' In order that your t\ctllei   y     %   hi\t  lull tnc im« u

am about to despa eh on this duty, wi ' \ rouablj i each your

This is the only cvid nee I can tmd of the ap-
pointment of an agent or warden, and it will be per-
ceived that this was during the existen  e of that
Administration which, according to my colleague's
views, did so much for Mame, an 1 to which she
owes such a debt of gratitude    For myseli, how-
ever, I do not believe that any President concurred
in that appointment It was a matter of inference
merely on the part of Mr Campbell and he was
probably as much mistaken in that as we have
already seen Mr. Bankhead was, in undertaking to
stale the Predenfs " desues "
Mr Campbell m the same letter, speaks of a
" comsenitoiwti/iotitter;" and this furnishes my col-
league with the occasion to inquire by what aulko-
ritij the President had assented to a " conventional
frontier," and to complain of the Administration for
its. caminal abandon meat of our terutory anil our
rights Sir, how easy is it to magnify trifles into
importance, to sec mountains in mole-lnlls, when
om vision is diseased? Of the sincerity oi my col-
league I do not doubt, but m this instance, at least,
his strong feelnirs oi opposition to General Jack-
son's administration—an opposition which can see
no good, but unmived evil in all its acts—has
misled and deceived him The conventional iron-
tier, of which Mr Campbell speaks, is nothing more
oi less than that which was established by Mr Clay
himseli, in the agreement before alluded to If the
British Government were to retain the posses-
sion of Midan aska settlement by the agreement,
win then, is u noi manifest that the boundary line
oi that settlement is, lor the timo being, a "conven-
tional jiontierV Nothing can lie plainer, and no
cvieleiiee tin be found (published or unpublished)

\entioiul fiontiei
Aitei the lejectton of the awaid of the King of
the Netherlands, ag eeably to the advice of the Se-
nate of (he United ¡states, negotiations were opened
with the Butisii Govt rnmciil, fen the settlement ol
the line accmding to the tenn ol the treaty of 178 i,
and m) colleague complains of Mr Livingston's
pu illani nity in mvtti ? ne¿ociations, and apolegiz-
incr fui the rejection oi the award I deny that
theie «as- my apology or any thing approaching to
it He stiicd ihc fact of the lejeclton, and then,
in phm and mini} leinis, gives l^e ground* of it
And as to the mutation lo enter upon negotiations,
pri> why shoull ho not haic invited ill Should
he ludtly hau tnsisttd, oi assumed a right lo com-
mand? Sir, I am no lnend to the old sy t«m of di-
plomacy, chaiai ten/id !>> duplicity, indirectness
and mtiigiie IN o su, I prefer General Jackson's
mode ol si\ mg light on, in plain,direct, and forci-
ble lanh'uyt «hat he hatl to s<iy—ol asking for
nothing bui «hit was nglit, vtitlj a determination
to submit to nothing w rong But inviting negotia-
tions, it appeals 11 me, is in no way inconsistent
with thiv
[Mr Lv ins said thai his colleague was entirely
mistaken, hf (Mr E ) had not complained of Mr
Livingston citrin for a supposed "apology" or "in-
vitation" tc negotiate J
Well Mr, then I mn t let it „j for my mistake,
th >u¿¡h I find it upon my minutes of that gentle-
man's spceth, fikan at the moment
But lompliinl is made ot Mr Livingston for
proposing to ihn British Government a newpiinci-
pl( ot sin vt y, to wit to abandon the due north
< mi e from th< Mmtee of the St Croix, if need be,
in or It i to slnke the highlands named in the treaty
ef 17m J If Mi Livingston had stopped here, it
ippoiis to me, he would have been fully justified
His i f unili n prme iple, that courses and distances

tun shall on id that which is less cutain The
li ¿hlan K, which divide the head waters of the
nic s ¡lowing into the Atlantic ocean irom those
which fail ititt tin river St Lawrence, is one oi the
monument- named in the treaty oi J7S.5, and if it
be necc ary to diverge from a true north line fiom
th m urce of ihe St Croix to strike these high-
1 mds, Í can see no objection to it But to ihe coi-
r<einess if the position that we should diverge to 'he
u est and not t< th" east, to the left and not to the
nrhi 1 cannot assent, noi wih Mame yield her as-
sent toa [ reposition so dangerous and suicidal in
i s nature
I have thus followed my colleague through his
list ot charges against the Administrations of
General Tack on and Mr Van Buren upon this
subject, and have endeavored to set things right—
approving and condemning, as the circumstances
seemed to require    Nothing is to be gained by
i unnecessarily impugning the course of the General
Government Our object now is to procure the
passsage of this bill—to take one decisive step to-
wards restating to Mame her long lost and much
abused rights. In this we need the aid of the
General Government, and confidently- expect to
receive it, m both its Legislative and Executive
branches. We call for the passage of this bill, as
a measure not only mild and prudent in Use , but
imperatively called for by the rights of Mame, and
corresponding obligations on the part of the Gene-
ral Government Mame is so unquestionably
right, and Great Britain so palpably wrong, in this
matter, that I cannot believe any member «ho
has looked at all into it will refuse us his vote
But I am aware that, from the circumstance of
this question being somewhat local in its charac-
ter, and perhaps from the circumstance, too, that
Maine has been so meek and uncomplaining under
injuries, it is not generally well understood I jaro-
póse, therefore, as briefly as I can, to give an ab-
stract of om title, and the questions now pending
between the two Governments
The northern and eastern boundaries of the
United States, and, consequently, of the State of
Mf«ne, are thus defined m the definitive tieaty ol
peace between Great Britain and the United States,
concluded at Pans the 3d of September, 1783
Art J And that all disputes which might arise id future on
the subject ol tin boundanes of the said united States may bo
pu vented, it is hereby agreed and declared that the following
uo, and snail be thou bountlanes, viz Fiom the northwest
aiiolr oi Nova Scotia, to vvtt that angle which is formed by i
Uno due north irom the source of the St Croix river to the
highlands, along the said highlands which divide those nversthat
ompty themselves into the nvei St Lawience, from those winch
lull into the Atlantic ocean, to the norihwesieinmost head of
tht Connecticut liver tlwnce d nvn alona; the middle of that
uvei to the forty nfth degree of north latitude, A:c '-East,by
a line to bo diawn along the middle of the iivei ht CroiK, from
its mouth in tht bay olTundy to its -nouice lndfrom us source,
directly north to the aforesaid highlands whichdivide thenveis
that fill into the <UIanuc ocean Irom those which iall into the
liver tot Lawrence  '
The first question thataiose under this treaty,
was, as to the true river intended by the St Croix
Piovision was made lor the settlement of it in the
treaty of 1795, commonly called Jay's treaty, and
in 1798, the commissioners appointed m pursuance
oi the provisions oí th s treaty, determined that the
river called by the Indian name of Schoodiac was
the true St Croix, and accordingly placed a monu-
ment at its source, which now remains as one of
the acknowledged and undisputed boundaries be-
tween the United States and the British colonies
At that time every thing else was supposed to be
well understood There was no other uncertainty
or ambigmtv alleged There was no dispute or
question made as to the localities of the monuments
relerred to m the treaty of 1783 There was then
no pretence of title to the now disputed territory set
up All these things, as we shall perceive, were
after-thoughts, suggested by the supposed conve-
nience and all-graspmg cupidity of Great Britain
At the negotiation oi the treaiy of Ghent m
1811, the British commissioners asked for a cession
of a pait of this now disputea temtory for an
equivalent Our ministers substantially replied and
rightfully, that they had no a Uhordy to cede That
the territory belonged to Massachi setts and Mame,
and no power could divest their title Then,/or
the first time, a doubt was suggested as to the boun-
dary This doubt in a short time ripened into a
claim , and this claim, founded upon pretences of
title the most preposterous, has been urged etor
since, if not with the most consummate efiromery,
at least with a pertinacity woithy of a better cause
Howevei, provision was made m that treaty
(1814) for the appointment oí comrmssioneis to
suivey the line, and, m case of disagreement, a
submission ot the question to some friendly sove-
reign was provided ior The commissioners ap-
pointed under th s provision of the treaty, aiier
attempts extending thiough a period of about five
yeais, could not agree, and thereupon, m pur-
suance of the treaty stipulations, the case, in 1827,
was referred, William, king of the Netherlands,
as I have before stated, being selected as the aibi-
tei The evidence was laid before him, and the
case argued with distinguished ability by Messrs
Preble and Gallatin, but without success Not-
withstanding his strong bias for Great Britain, and
adver-ary feelings for the United States, the case
