SAINT LOUIS, MO., March 21, 1864.

(Received 12.15 a.m., 22nd.)

His Excellency A. LINCOLN,

President United States:

It is important that I should have at least one good mounted regiment from some State east, but, if possible, not contiguous to this, for North Missouri. It ought to be sent at once. I hope all the policy submitted to the War Department in a letter a few days since will be approved. All my movements await action on that. I telegraph you because the matter must be up about this time, and would like you to know it.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
