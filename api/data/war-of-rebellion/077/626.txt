HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,Pulaski, October 6, 1864-p. m.

General MORGAN,

Commanding:

Have communicated your position to Major-General Thomas at Nashville; also to General Rousseau. General R. was to meet General Croxton at Hall's, on old military road, this morning; will probably be near you by time this is delivered. Elk River is impassable; one of your couriers with dispatches reported drowned. Send all the information possible this way, so that General Thomas can be kept fully advised. News as to yourself received from Athens.

JOHN C. STARKWEATHER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
