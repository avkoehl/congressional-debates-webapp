Kentucky, and I believe will be more useful there. Can they be exchanged for new Ohio regiments? A brigade moves up Kanawha to-day to make bridges on road at Ten-Mile Creek. A scouting party of men, used to the country, are now up the river, and I look for definite information from them. As soon as the troops can possibly be put in moving condition, I desire to go forward, waiting for nothing else. My old division has bene delayed at Cumberland. All its transportation was retained in the Army of the Potomac. One of Milroy's regiments is still on furlough. I gave another in its place, and will collect that one here. He is en route for Parkersburg. Wagons are a great necessity, both here and at Clarksburg. there is no navigation in the Ohio or Kanawha; latter reported obstructed at Red House.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have been informed that General Gorman is desirous of being relieved from duty with this army, and being ordered on duty in the West. General Howard, now commanding the division to which General Gorman is attached, is sick, and will not probably be able to do duty for some time. General Gorman is the next officer in rank, but I do not consider him in every respect suited to such a command. If you can order him to some command in the West, I should be glad.

Our reconnaissance has passed Charlestown, after considerable opposition. A party has been to Kearneysville, and communicated with the party from Shepherdstown. I hear no firing at present.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I respectfully request authority to delegate to Major-General Banks, commanding the Defense of Washington, the powers of a commander of a department or detached corps, so far as regards courts-martial, resignations of volunteer officers, and discharges of soldiers. This arrangement would facilitate action in cases embraced under these heads.
