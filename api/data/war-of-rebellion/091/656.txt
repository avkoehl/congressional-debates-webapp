HDQRS. FIRST BRIGADIER, FIRST DIV., 19TH ARMY CORPS, ARMY OF THE SHENANDOAH,Camp Russell, va., November 21, 1864.

Major P. FRENCH,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Nineteenth Army Corps:

I respectfully call the attention of the major-general commanding corps to the unwarrantable conduct of the pickets on the right of the First Brigade, First Division, Nineteenth Army Corps. For nearly one hour last evening the yelling, screaming, an cheering was shameful in the extreme, to say nothing of the constant firing. At least thirty muskets were discharged in less than half an hour. I would further report that I visited the pickets of the whole corps once during the day and at 4.30 this morning. With the exception of one brigade (Fourth, of the Second Division), I found them vigilant and attentive. This brigade was not deployed till some minutes after 6 o'clock. The Third Brigade, First Division, picket remain on post two days, their brigade out on reconnaissance.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

N. A. DUDLEY,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
