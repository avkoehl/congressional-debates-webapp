BRIDGEPORT, October 27, 1863-6.30 a.m.

Troops are now just moving out for Shellmound and Raccoon Mountain. No evidence to show that the rebels will oppose the undertaking. Hooker came here from Stevenson last night. He is in an unfortunate state of mind for one who has to co-operate, fault finding, criticizing, dissatisfied. No doubt the chaos of Rosecrans' administration is as bad as he describes, but he is quite as truculent toward the plan he is now to execute as toward the importance and confusion of the old regime.

WHITESIDE'S VALLEY, October 27, 1863-4.30 p.m.

On reaching the mouth of Lookout Valley yesterday afternoon, Hooker encamped Howard's corps at the west base of the range of five mamelons or hills occupied and fortified by General Smith, while he encamped Geary's division at Wauhatchie, fully 2 1/2 miles distant. These positions not only invited attack from the enemy, who could see everything from the top of Lookout Mountain, but were very bad for the defense of the valley, and General Hazen, commanding the forces on the mamelons, went to General Hooker and endeavored to get him to take up a compact line across the valley, and to bring all his forces together. But being confident the enemy would not disturb him, Hooker refused to change his dispositions. The consequence was that about 12 p.m. rebels fell upon Geary, seeking
