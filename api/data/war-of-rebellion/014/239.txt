ORDNANCE OFFICE,

Washington, June 21, 1862-11.10 a.m.

General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN,

Army of the Potomac, near Richmond, Va.:

My attention has been called by the Secretary of War to the defective nature of the time fuses used with your 20-pounders. As all the paper time fuses used with the Army of the Potomac are made and carefully tested at the Washington Arsenal, I am at a loss to understand the nature of the defects referred to. Be pleased to state all the circumstances of the failure, so that I may act understandingly, and I will use every means in my power to correct it.

Mr. Schenkl is pushing work on the 20-pounder projectiles. The preparation of machinery will necessarily delay their delivery some days. I have this day ordered him to send you 5,000 30-pounder projectiles with all possible dispatch.

JAS. W. RIPLEY,

Brigadier-General.

McCLELLAN'S, June 21, 1862-2 p.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary or War:

I would respectfully request that no persons be permitted to visit White House or the corps of this army except upon strictly military duty. All the means of railway transportation are required to supply
