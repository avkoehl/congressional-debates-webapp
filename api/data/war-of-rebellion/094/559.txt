Major-General.

LARKINSVILLE, January 9, 1865.

Major-General STEEDMAN:

Brigadier-General Wood ordered me, on alleged authority from General Thomas, to stop my command, return and head off or pursue rebel General Lyon's forces. Lyon crossed railway at Scottsbourgh last night. Malloy drove him off; Harrison and Malloy, Thompson, Mitchell, and Salm are in pursuit, the latter two close on his rear, near Guntersville. We may possible catch him. Have just returned from all day and night on road. Will respond to your order promptly as possible. In conflict of orders, it has been difficult to tell what to do, but I have acted on what I supposed to be General Thomas' orders. Can you send the pontoon asked from Bridgeport by transports to Lamb's Ferry or Gunter's Landing to-night? else I must abandon the pursuit some of the command being wholly out and no means to supply from here.

CHARLES CRUFT,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,Huntsville, Ala., January 9, 1865.

Colonel T. J. MORGAN,

Commanding Brigade:

Join General Cruft with your brigade and Malloy's command as soon as possible.

TH. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
