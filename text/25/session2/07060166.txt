25th Cong••• 2nd Sess,                       Making public officers depositaries—Mr. Brotan.                                                          Senate.
fusal, is threatened expulsion from power Is it
not with this view, and to attain this end, that the
banks refuse to resume specie payments'? Is it not
for the purpose of placing the will of thenation, and,
through it, that of the Congress of the United States
in a kind of moral and political duress, that
this measure, so important to the restoration of
confidence, and of general prosperity in every
branch of buwness, is so wantonly and unnecessa-
rily delayedl Is it not, by this course of measures,
intended lo.bring the whole force and energies oí"
the moneyed power to bear on the decision of the
country, and of the constituted authorities, m rela-
tion to this subject? It was a matter which ought
to attract the earnest attention of the people ol this
country, that, foi the last four 01 five years, no
sooner had Congress assembled to deliberate on
the affairs of the country, at each session, than the
cries of distress and pecuniary embarrassment
were echood and re-echoed Irom one part of the
nation to the other, by the partisan presses of the
banks, and of the Opposition This could not be
a mere casual coincidence, for it had happened too
frequently, and been repeated too often, to be the
meie effect of accident. It indicated clearly, to
his miad, that there was a power secretly and per-
sevenngly at work, m this country, to establish its
own supremacy over the public will, and to contiol
the regular operations ot the Government. Enter-
taining these views on the subject, he should con-
sider that he would be guilty of a treasonable dere-
liction of duty to the public liberties and interests,
if be were not to resist such an attempt, as tar as
he could.
While ihe banks occupied the hostile and me-
nacing attitude towards the Government and the
people, which they did at present, he, for one,
even it true policy required that the revenues ot
the Government should be deposited with them,
which he denied, would resist their bold and dan-
gerous pretensions. While they were thundering
at the doors of the Capitol, and their partisans
wete arrogantly demanding a surrender of the
public treasuies, to be placed in their keeping, he
would enter into no parley with them, nor make
any terms It was the duty of the friends oi fiee
Government to take a firm and determined stand
at the Thermopyl v ot the Constitution, an 1 to de-
fend the passes to it against the hosts and legions
that aie marching on it, under the banners ol the
moneyed power
That the hnln, or that portion of them who were
controlled In the United States Bank of Pennsylva-
nia, weic delaying a resumption of specie pay-
ments, with a view to act on the public m nil,on the
great question now at issue, he could r it permit
lumsell to doubt The period when Ihe sound por-
tion of than could resume with safety, had almost
universally been agreed to be, by the ablest finan-
ciers of the countrj, that at which ti e exchanges
between this country and England should fall down
to par Bills on England, according to the latest
puces current, in the city ot New York, had m t
unlv filien to par, but, agreeably to a specie stan-
dard, were estimated, at that time, to be four per
rent, in our tavor, an occurrence almost without
example in our commercial history The effect of
this slate of things, then, is effectually to prevent the
exportation of specie from our own country, the
demand for which formerly to send abroad was the
chief pretext of the banks for suspending payments
The effect of this favorable state of exchanges, is
not only to prevent'specie from being earned abroad,
but to induce the importation of large sums oí the
precious metals, from fo¡ eign nations, into this coun-
ti v That this state of things afforded the proper
occasion for a resumption by ihe banks, and that
ihf v had no right, and could not, with propriety,
make anv anticipated action of Congress the pre-
lext for a postponement, he begged leave to read
two extiacis Irom the report of the delegates of the
banks of the city of New York to the Bank Con-
vention, which assembled in Novembei last The
delegates-, who^e names were «igaert to this repon,
were composed of men from both the great politi-
cal paities, and were eminent for their comnnrcial
experience and information. Among them was the
name of Albert Gallatin, who, though understood
to be opposed to the Administration, wat yet, by all,
admitted to be a most able finaucier.
And first, as to the pretext of postponing on ac-
count oi awaiting the favorable action of Congres?
The repoi t says
Winn we see such extensive, general, and \vw may say, m
toleiablo, evils, flowing Hum a general sutpention of specie
payments by the banks, tt is monstrous to suppose tint, if they
are abl« to resume, and sustain nuch pay menta, ihev should have

Here, then, said Mr B the ground j« distinctly
taken, that the hanks, under their solemn obliga-
tions to the coumiy, lo re nine specie paymiiit',
ha\e no discretionary right to look to, or ovtn to
discuss, any thing beyond Ihe question of their
ability to r"sume and maintain them These able
and experienced merchants and financiers had not
discovered, with the .Senator from Virginia, [Mr.
Rivts,] and the Senator fiom New Yoik, [Mr
TjaLWADor,] that it was necessaiy for the Govern-
ment to extend "a helping hand" to ihe banks, prt-
paiilory to a resumption What right had they to
call on the Government lo re-e tablish them in the
public (onfidenee, before they had shown that they
had used every prop-r exertion to entitle themselves
toil? With what justice or piojviety could they
call on Hertttles, to aid them in getting out of their
present difficult . , befoie they had put their own
shoulders to the whet I1 Why had they not avail-
ed them-.el ves ot the lapid specie current, which
had been, foi some time past, and was now, setting
in the direction ot this country, from Europe, and
mvesied some of iheir enoimous. piofits in it, to
enable llirm lo íesume? Ot was it now lo become
iht doctrine, thai, to keep up what had been falsely
failed tht credit system, the Government was
to do every thing, and the banks nothing, and that
the country is to submit to all the sacrifices inci-
dent to a suspension of specie payments, while the
banks are to make none to relieve it from such a
calamity?
The charge that the Administration had made
war against the banks, and theoredit system of the
country, Mr, B considered utterly groundless and
untenable. Th  very reverte was the fact. The
Government, after having filled the cofTers of many
of those in&titutions with its specie funds, had, in
the eloquent language of the Senator from Ohio,
[Mr. Auto,] been struck down in a single night,
by the dttermnnatioa of the banks of the city of
New York, to suspend specie payments, and its
opeiations paralyzed, from inability lo command its
revenues. In doing this, they had trampled under
foot the most sacred stipulations in their charters,
and assumed a power which none but sovereignty
itself is capable of exerting, that of mipcnding iht
laws af the land The Bank of England, with all
its sliengfh and power, had not dared thus to oat-
rage public sentiment, when it suspended specie
payments in 1796, but had paid a deieience to that,
and the laws under which it existed, by first apply-
,ng foi, and obtaining, an order of csuncil to that
effect. The plea of necessity was no justification
for the suspension ot law, and that m a time of
piofound peace So sacred is this principle in a
Republic, that no necessity, however strong, can
justify a departure from it, unless in an extreme
case, m a state of war, when the páiamount con-
sideration ol the public safety might make it neces-
sary.
The dispensing powei, even by the sovereigns
of England, had been resorted to only in. the most
arbmary íeigns. It had ever been considered an
odious exercise of power by them, to turn aside the
law tiom Us ordinary operation, and had, among
other offences, occasioned the loss of the crown to
the Stuait lamily. When corporations assumed
the exercise of this high power, by which con-
sequences so disastrous to the country had hap-
pened, the charge which had been made against the
Administration, of making war upon them, and
wishing to violate their lights, came with a veiy ill
gince from those by whom it was pieferred
When individuals violate the laws, they are
punished, and the penalty for their offences is gene-
rally enforced, but when a great moneyed coipo-
ration sets them at defiance, it almost brings re-
proach and denunciation on the individual who ven-
tures to speak of their accountability to ihe laws of
the land
"Plate sin with gold,
And ihtt atrong lance of pi in e fiurtletts bleaks,
Arm it in i igs, and a pigmy's striw doth picico it "
In a Government professing to be Republican,
this should be otherwise, and the most powerful
corpoiations as well as the humblest individual,
should be piactieally amenable to the laws.
He would now notice a charge, which it was
becoming quite fashionable, in a cettam quarter,
to make against the sup| orters of Ihe policy of the pre-
sent Administration, and particularly in reference to
the present question It was by no means unusual
to hear the names of Agrarians, Loco Focos, and
such other epithets as often decorate the vocabula-
ry of a certain political party, applied to those who
think it then duty to suppott the present measure.
If it was meant by ibis to contey the idea, that
the great body of those who supported it, were m
favor of violating the rights of properly, or of the
sacred punciples of justice, in lefeience to in-
dividual rights, then he should not hesitate to
speak of it, as it deserved, and as a gross libel on *
the great body of the Democracy of the country.
If theie be any class, whose doctrines favor a vio-
lation of the rights of property among us, it is to
be found among those who arc the advocates of
dangerous monopolies and privileges. If there be
any class of politicians among us, whose doc-
trines favor the interests of the few, at the ex-
pense of the many, it is that class, who, under the
pretext of supporting what is most erroneously
called the credit system, encourage a fraudulent
system of banking That such a system is the
readiest way to defraud men of then honest earn-
ings, and is but a system of legalized plunder,
there can be no doubt. Of an honest system of
banking, he did not speak, which, however, is very
rare, but he spoke of that system which had been
