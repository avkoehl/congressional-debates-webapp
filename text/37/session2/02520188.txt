THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 6,
change made. The statement of the Senator was
notcorrect; I did notcorrect him at the time; but
according to the statement of the organization
which I have in my hand, furnished by a very
careful person, the fifth circuit is composed of the
States of Alabama and Louisiana, and the fourth
circuit of the States of Maryland, Delaware, and
Virginia. My bill simply proposes to affect the
three circuits in which there are vacancies.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The table of the popula-
tion was made up by a clerk, and I supposed he
had reference to the law in preparing it. He may,
however, have committed an error in that respect,
I am not prepared to say. If the Senator has
looked at the law, he is no doubt correct. If the
bill, as introduced by the Senator from Ohio, be
adopted, it will not accomplish the object of equal-
izing the circuits, but will leave them very un-
equal, as they now are. The bill, as reported by
the committee, does accomplish that object, and
1 think it a fair bill.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will state in reply to the
observation of the Senator from Illinois, that the
bill as introduced by me does equalize the circuits
except the one in which Ohio is. It makes that
circuit much larger than most of the others, but
if we do not complain of it I do not think any one
else should. According to the plan of the circuits
as proposed by me, the circuitcomposed of Rhode
Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and
Maine, contains 2,360,034 inhabitants; that com-
posed of Vermont, Connecticut, and New York,
contains 4,6G2,809; that of New Jersey and Penn-
sylvania, 3,578,401; that of Maryland, Delaware,
and Virginia, 2,395,331; that of Alabama, Louisi-
ana, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas, 3,502,841;
that of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,
and Florida,2,894.247; thatofOhio, Indiana,and
Michigan, 4,439,052; that of Kentucky, Tennes-
see, and Missouri, 3,447,8^; that of Illinois, Wis-
consin, Minnesota, Iowa, and Kansas, 3,441,706.
Thus Senators will perceive that the circuits are
equalized as near as may be. If there is any in-
equality it is in the circuits of which Ohio and
New York respoo.fively compose part. Those are
the largest circuits, as will be seen more clearly
by the table to which I have referred:

The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on
the amendment reported by the Committee on the
Judiciary.
Mr. SHERMAN called for the yeas and nays,
and they were ordered.
The Secretary proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. WADE (after first voting in the negative)
said: I desire to change my vote. I vote "yea,"
with a view to move a reconsideration.
The result was then announced—yeas 28, nays
7; as follows:
YEAS—Messrs. Browning, Chandler, Clark, CoJIamer,
Cowan, Davis, Doolittle, Fesscnden, Foster, Grimes, Har-
lan, Harris, Howe, King, Lane of Indiana, Lane of Kan-
sas, Latham, Morrill, Nesmith, Pomeroy, Powell, Rice,
Sumner, Ten Eyck, Trumbull, Wade, Wilkinson, and
Wilson—28.
NAYS—Messrs. Bright, Carhle, Johnson of Tennessee,
Kennedy, Saulsbury, Sherman, and Willey—7.
So the amendment of the committee was agreed
to.
Mr. "WADE. I hope, sir, that the further con-
sideration of this bill will be postponed. I had no
idea that this important bill was up to-day. In
fact, I did not know that the committee had had it
before them at all. It is a matter of very great
importance, as we consider, to us, how these dis-
tricts are arranged, and I do not suppose there is a
lawyer in Ohio who likes this arrangement. I wish
T had been consulted upon this important subject
even before the committee had reported. Certainly
we have had no opportunity to make our views
known upon it. I hope the further consideration
of the bill will be postponed to some future day,
and I make that motion.
The VICE PRESIDENT. What day?
Mr. WADE. I do not desire to postpone it
unreasonably, but I want some time to look into
it. 1 will say next Monday.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I shall not object to post-
poning it for the purpose of allowing'the Senator
from Ohio to consider it, if he wishes to do so. I
certainly thought he was aware of the report of
the committee and knew what it was. I will state,
however, that it is important that this bill in some
shape should pass at an early day. The Supreme
Court has but six judges upon the bench. The
other three ought to be appointed, but I presume
they will not be appointed until some bill passes
on the subject, and I think it would be best to act
upon it as early as we conveniently can. I will
not urge the Senator from Ohio to name an earlier
day than will suit his convenience. I repeat what
I said before he came in, that I have certainly no
tenacity as to the particular arrangements of the
circuits, and should be very glad indeed if the Sen-
ator from Ohio can arrange them so that his State
will unite with some other State that will be more
acceptable to them than Kentucky, if it can be
done with a due regard to population, the business
of the circuits, and the geography of the country.
I shall not resist the postponement of the bill to
any reasonable day, but I hope the Senator will
name the earliest day that will suit his conven-
ience.
Mr. WADE. Well, sir, I propose a week from
to-day; that is, next Monday. 1 will state that
I had seen the printed bill which was referred to
the Judiciary Committee; but I did not know that
they had acted upon the subject. My colleague,
I believe, introduced a bill at an early period,
which met with my approbation; and I did not
know that it was to be seriously controverted, I
believe in the House of Representatives also they
have reported a bill making a different arrange-
ment of these circuits. Certainly I did not sup-
pose so important a subject would be taken up at
this time when it was very doubtful whether'we
had a quorum. I did not know that the Judiciary
Committee had passed upon it, or even taken it
into consideration; for I intended to make my
objections known to them before they reported.
I hope it will be postponed.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on
postponing the further consideration of this bill
until Monday next.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I believe we have made a
special order for Monday.
The YICE PRESIDENT. That was for Mon-
day week.
Mr. WADE. Before the question is put on the
motion to postpone, I desire to enter a motion to
reconsider the vote just taken agreeing to the
amendment reported by the Committee on the
Judiciary.
The YJCE PRESIDENT. The Senator's
motion will be entered, if there be no objection.
The Chair hears none. The question recurs on
the motion to postpone the further consideration
of this bill to Monday next.
The motion was agreed to.
EXECUTIVE SESSION.
Mr. WILSON. I move that the Senate do now
adjourn.
Mr. GRIMES. I desire to have a short exec-
utive session, and I make that motion.
Mr. WILSON. I withdraw my motion for
that purpose.
The motion of Mr. Grimes was agreed to; and
the Senate'proceeded to the consideration of exec-
utive business; and after some time spent therein,
the doors were reopened, and
The Senate adjourned.
HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES.
Monday, January 6, 1862.
The House met at twelve o'clock, m. Prayer
by the Chaplain of the Senate, Rev. Byron Sun-
derland, as follows:
O God, who holdest all things in Thy hands,
and uscst them as the ministers of Thy pleasure,
we commit our country, our rulers, our soldiers,
and the whole people to Thy keeping. Make us
pure and just. Give us courage and faith in the
mighty struggle of freedom and religion. Make
us cautious and prudent, but yet brave and bold
to strike for the eternal right against the appall-
ing madness and guilt of this rebellion. Give to
the Representatives of the collected States and of
the destiny of this great people, wisdom and un-
derstanding, that they may not pause—that they
may not hesitate—that they may not parley in
vain speech or idle question; but that they may
give the most speedy and the most effectual meas-
ures of moral, monetary, and martial power, to
strike in the front this great conspiracy, and to
clothe the whole coast-lme of the Republic with
muniments, impregnable and invincible, against
the armed wiles and wickedness of foreign arro-
gance and malice. For this great miracle we pray,
O Thou supreme giver of the gifts of men; and
we will ever render hearty thanks, through Jesus
Christ our Lord. Amen.
The Journal of Thursday last was read and
approved.
