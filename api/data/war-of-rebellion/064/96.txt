but don't wait; let them go to work with their shotguns and pistols at once and don't fail to kill every murdering their you can find at his hellish work. Strike with determination and vigor. Preserve good discipline in your force.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,Saint Joseph, Mo., May 28, 1864.

Major A. C. MARSH,

Assistant Provost-Marshal, Troy, Mo.:

Call into service the best company of militia in Lincoln County. Let them go to work at once on a mission of extermination of thieves and guerrillas. They can arm themselves as best they can until we can get Government arms and other necessary supplies. Strike swiftly and with determination. Take no prisoners. Kill the willains wherever caught in their hellish practices. Move earnestly. I have ordered a company on duty in Pine County and one in Montgomery County. Peace we must have. Bushwhacking must be put down if it takes half the militia of the district to accomplish it. Strike terror to the hearts of evil-doers.

Colonel G. W. ANDERSON,

Louisiana, Mo.:

Order into active service the best company of militia you can raise from your regiment for duty in Pike County. Let them go right to work, with such arms as they have or can be obtained from rebels or others in your county. Government arms and all else necessary for proper outfit will be furnished as soon as possible. We must take hold of the thieving, murdering villains with determination and vigor; let them be killed wherever found at their wicked work.
