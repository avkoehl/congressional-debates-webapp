approved by General Deitzler. I do not suppose we have a full supply and fear issues to some will displease others. Your direction for men to furnish themselves should be urged no troops.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

WYANDOTTE, October 16, 1864.

Captain WILLANS:

Organize at once a section of 3-inch guns, with colored soldiers, twenty in number, and if Lieutenant Flanagan has arrived give him command and detail at least twenty of his men for cannoneers, making forty in all; the colored men for drivers. I will telegraph Major McNutt to get the section ready. If Lieutenant Flanagan and his men have not arrived add twenty more colored men, detailing some good officer to bring outfit here. Direct Colonel Hodges to furnish me forty good artillery horses. I will have to loan them to General Deitzler for his guns. He can invoice to me and request him to have them in readiness. Have them all shod and send some extra shoes and nails. Send Minor along with his men. Have Colonel Hodges brand the horses C. A. (chief of artillery), so that I can keep track of them.

By order of Major-General Curtis:

R. H. HUNT,

Chief of Artillery.

WYANDOTTE, October 16, 1864.

Captain WILLANS:

Major Curtis is here all right. I send you a corporal and six men to assist you in outfitting that section. Have them come back with section. Have Lieutenant Gill's men arrived from Larned? If so, send them by all means.

R. H. HUNT,

Major and Chief of Artillery.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 16, 1864.

Major R. H. HUNT,

Chief of Artillery:

Section of battery all ready. Will start in about an hour, when men get together. Gill's men not come in.

LEAVENWORTH, KANS., October 16, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

I just had a talk with the operator at Warrensburg. He says the advance of the rebels are at Knobnoster moving on Warrensburg, Shelby's force and additions. The commander at Warrensburg is evacuating the place and moving this way.
