tions more safely than in the case of boys
under twenty-one. In fact as a race they are
children all their lives, and require both pro-
tection and control.
Such have been the results of my own ob-
servation and my reading in regard to the
characteristics of the two races; and yet I
have no unkind feelings toward the African
race, though I would deny to them political
power for their own benefit as well as ours.
In the course of a long life I never had the
slightest collision with any individual of that
race, and I certainly have protected many of
them from oppression and wrong, and if I
know my own heart, have no feelings in rela-
tion to the race other than those of kindness
and a desire for their protection and welfare.
Neither I nor any of my kith or kin have held
slaves or had any interest in the question of sla-
very since my boyhood. I have, however, stood
in a position where I have had an opportunity,
unbiased by any interest whatever, to observe
the relation of races, and such is the result of
my observation. If there be one opinion on
which I have a more decided conviction than
any other it is that if political power is con-
ferred upon this inferior race the conflict of
races sooner or later will be inevitable. I hope
earnestly that it may never come in my day ;
but when it does come,- the primary law of
nature, the affinity of race will assert itself,
and the inferior race will perish in the col-
lision. For their sake, therefore, as well as
for the prosperity and happiness of my coun-
try, I must resist this partisan attempt to re-
tain power by means of forcing upon the coun-
try, against the sense of the people of at least
ten States of the Union, a race of inferior
organization as their political equals.
Sir, I have already told you that if you will
refer this amendment to the people of the
States in their conventions, or if, as the Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania proposes, you will sub-
mit it for ratification to Legislatures to be
elected after it has been proposed by Congress,
and the peopfe ratify your action, it must be
submitted to without hesitation, whatever may
be the views of its opponents of the injurious
and destructive effect of its adoption.
But, Mr. President, if this amendment is to
be passed in any of its proposed forms at the
present session of Congress, and is to be re-
ferred to existing Legislatures who have been
elected by the people of the States without ref-
erence to this question, and without the slight-
est intimation that such an amendment was
contemplated by the Republican party, the
result may be very different. Nothing can lead
to its ratification by the Legislatures of many
of the States without first taking the sense of
their people, except the overswaying and per-
verting influence of party spirit. It will be a
dangerous experiment to make upon the pa-
tience of the country to force through an amend-
ment to the Federal Constitution which abro-
gates the constitutions of at least ten States of
the Union against the consent of their people
by the faithless betrayal of trust by their rep-
resentatives. Though this great wrong may
be perpetrated those faithless representatives
both here and in the State Legislatures may yet
find that "it is the last drop in the cup which
will cause the waters ofbitterness to overflow."
Unequal Distribution of Employes of the
Government.
REMARKS OF HON. J. P. C. SHANKS,
OP INDIANA,
In the House of Representatives,
February 13, 1869.
The House being in Committee of the Whole on
the state of the Union—
Mr. SHANKS said:
Mr. Chairman : I take this occasion to put
upon the record, for the benefit of the members
of the House, a subject of some importance to
the House and the country. It is that of the
unequal distribution of the number and rank
of the employes of the Government. In a
great Republic like this the benefits as well as
the burdens of the Government should as near
as possible be divided equally among the peo-
ple. I find, by examination of the Blue Book
of 1867, that in eight Departments—the Inte-
rior, War, Treasury, Navy, State, Agricul-
tural, Attorney General's, and Post Office—
there are employed in this city four thou-
sand three hundred and ninety-four clerks. I
take none of those holding higher positions
and I take none holding lower positions than
of clerks. I include no heads of bureaus,
many of whom are also from this District. Of
those four thousand three hundred and ninety-
four clerks, I find the District of Columbia
furnishes directly one thousand one hundred
and fifteen ; and while that is true, there is a
large number credited to different States who
absolutely live in the District of Columbia and
vote here.
The District of Columbia, in addition to hav-
ing this number of clerks, has the day labor-
ers and almost all the messengers in the De-
partments I have named and the employes for
all the other public works, offices, and places
located here. In the eight Departments named
some of the States have but one clerk, some
two, three, four, five, six, seven, and so on,
the highest number of any one of them being
New York, which has seven hundred and
ninety ; but that is a large State. The follow-
ing table shows the inequality that exists, and
I call special attention to it. This District
furnishes over one fourth of the Government
clerks in employ in the capital, of whom a large
number are grossly disloyal; but aside from
their want of loyalty the thing is unjust to the
people:
Inequality of numbers of Government civil employes in the Departments at Washington.

The District has all the day laborers in these and all other public employments, and almost all the mes-
sengers. In addition to the above showing, there are some accredited to the Army; these are generally em-
Bloyed m the War Department. There are of these two hundred and four there, and some twenty in other
'epartments.
I think that this matter is one of very great
importance to the people of the country, be-
cause from these offices, if equally represented
from the various districts and Territories, em-
ployes would go out to and correspond with
the people of the different parts of the coun-
giving information touching what is going
on in the Departments and in the capital, thus
keeping up a healthy channel of communica-
tion between the Government and people, as
valuable and faithful as though it went out
from this House. A few days ago I introduced
a bill, No. 1711, which may be found on the
files, on this subject, which I insert in my re-
marks, and to which I also ask the especial
attention of members. The system of select-
ing cadets for the Military Academy at West
Point and midshipmen for the Naval School
at Annapolisis from the congressional districts,
so as to equalize the representation and benefits
of those beneficiary public schools, and there is
no reason why the same justice should not be
extended to the Government employes here.
Of course, the employments through the coun-
try must be made where most convenient, and
have in them no national representative char-
acter, or position. The more channels of com-
munication that we can open between the Gov-
