Mr. BALL. I ask that the report be read.
The report of the Committee on Invalid Pen-
sions was read. It appears from it that Jonathan
Pearce was a private in Captain James Brown's
company of Colonel Miller's regiment of Ohio
militia, as substitute for his brother, who was
drafted in August, 1812, at Zanesville, Ohio, and
served six months, when he was honorably dis-
charged. The original certificate of discharge is
on file in the Pension Office in an application for
bounty land. That Pearce was one of a company
despatched on an expedition against the Indians,
and was absent eight days, and had food for five
days only. That m consequence of lack of food
anu exposure he took sick, and remained so for
six weeks, then partially recovered, and served out
his time. That soon afterwards his disease settled
in his limbs, producing chronic rheumatism, and
he has suffered from it ever since. And that, for
the last twenty or twenty-five years he has hob-
bled round on crutches; he is now aged sixty-
three; incurable, and a man of good character.
Mr. BALL. I ask the attention of the com-
mittee for a very few moments. 1 presume there
is no objection to this bill, but I want the pension
of this m.-'.n to commence two years back. The
application was made two years ago, but the
case has been delayed to this time. He is con-
fined to his bed, and is able neither to get in or
out of it, and for the last twenty-five years he has
not been able to perform a single day's labor, all
resulting from exposure upon the Maumee river,
and sleeping on the snows during the campaign
of 1812. I move that the bill be amended by
striking out "eighteen hundred and fifty-four,Â®'
and inserting "eighteen hundred and fifty-two."
The amendment was agreed to.
No objection being made, the bill was then laid
aside to be reported to the House, with a recom-
mendation that it pass.

The bill, which was read, directs the Secretary
of the Interior to cause to be paid to William
Parker, of New York, the sum of four dollars per
month so long as he shall live, commencing Jan-
uary 1, 1853. This sum to be in addition to the
pension of four dollars per month granted him by
the act of May 19,1824.
The bill was laid aside to be reported to the
House, with a recommendation that it pass.

one insists upon having the bill read.
The bill was read.
