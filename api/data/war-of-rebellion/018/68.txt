when may I expect it at Harper's Ferry? Was my dispatch of the 8th concerning transportation received?

J. C. FREMONT,

Major-General, Commanding.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, April 11, 1862.

Major-General FREMONT, Wheeling:

The transportation you requested has been ordered. Blenker was between Strasburg and Winchester at last reports, with orders to join you. It would be well for you to send a competent officer with our orders to him and to direct his march. The Enfield rifles are ordered to be sent as soon as they can be had.

Nothing new at the West or from Yorktown.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WHEELING, April 11, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Your dispatch concerning Blenker just received. Still I have need in different quarters for all the troops in the department. Especially I desire immediately to move troops to the support of General Milroy. His scouts were skirmishing to-day with rebel cavalry, 6 miles in advance of Monterey. General Milroy has encountered severe weather in the mountains. Heavy snow. Streams everywhere flooded, and communication interrupted.

J. C. FREMONT,

Major-General.

WHEELING, VA., April 11, 1862-10.30 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have immediate need of all the force in the department, specially to sustain General Milroy and operate with him. Are all the troops within the limits of my department subject to my direction and command?

J. C. FREMONT,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, April 11, 1862.

Major-General FREMONT, Wheeling:

The troops operating in your department under General Morgan are not subject to your direction; all others are. Blenker's division will be hurried on to Harper's Ferry as fast as possible, where they will be subject to your orders.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
