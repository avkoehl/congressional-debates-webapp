were not ruined.
At length war was declared against Great Bri-
tain, on which the air rang with their waitings,
followed by their bitter execrations of such a deles-
table band of outlaws as the Democrat  were, foi
bringing such a crisis upon the nation nothing,
they said, but disoigamzalion, desolation and con-
fusion, would maik the footsteps ot the dema-
gogue!) the Government would be overthrown,
and all world be piostrated and cinslied beneath
its turns The pious, ministers of the Gospel seiml
the fust opportunity, alter war w as declared, to
sind forth lrom the hallowed desk their denunci-
ations of the measure in the most fervid and
eloquent strains, and offering up their piajers ioi
the miserable, besotted people, who were the vic-
tims of a venal and conupt administration Mi

people -«ere at the bottom of then united efloits to
awaken them to then Joiloni condition in those
clays as «ell as these He would ask the indul-
gence ol the Senate, while he would read, as e \ 1-

livered by the Rev. David Osgood, D D pasun ol

In 1832, the powerful and much cherished ally
of the Federal partv., the Bank ol the UmtedSta'es,
came before Congress for a renewal of its chartei,
and, by some means or other, received the sanc-
tion of both Houses, and was «ent to President
Jackson for his approval    The President disap-
pioved the bill, and ltturned it to the Senate, in
which it originated, with his reasons for his refusal
to sign it, which were, that it was unconstitutional
and inexpedient, and would be unjust to the people
in its operation Again the same party attacked
the President with as much violence and ferocity
as they ever had done, and the gigantic power
which the paity, with its ally, the bank, were ca-
pable of wielding, the people weie made to feel in
its full plenitule Tne whole nation was thrown
into convulsions, and the aggiandi-ement of the
paitv, through the bank, was «holly lost sight of,
in then extreme anxielj íelt fot the suffering peo-
ple, «ho weie to be depmed of both money and
credit, if the bank could not be leiharteied.
Piesident Jackson became satisfied that the pub-
lic lunds weie being used by the Bank of Ihe
United Stalls to oppress and harass the people,
who weie Hie iighiiul owners ol the mono)s, and
to secuie the people against such abuses, he advised
the removal ol them lrom the United States Bank

party to he prcscn-nt with uch evil as toovcr-
whelm this natu n with disaster, and bring upon it
disgrace and rum and again the deluded people
aie to s iffei ignominy and shame for their stupidity
and ignorance, and want of capacity to select for
themselves a suitable person for Chief Magistrate.
And so alarmed, said Mr, IS had this party recent-
ly become for the people, that they had employee!
and sent missionaries from the far West, into the
Eastern States, to enlighten them in the science of
Government, and to warn them of the imminent
danger they were in, under (he misrule of President
Van Buren, wihose mal-administration had already
been too obvious, they thought, not to be discovered
even by the besotted people, without ihe aid ef
these shining lights from the West And where
do we find the principal theatre of action of these
missionanes at the East? Why, in the city of
New York, located in the most splendid hotel in
the city, from whence they issued their tickets at
ten dollars each. Such of the people as were able,
and disposed to pay that sum for the privilege of
hearing their eloquence upon the ruinous condi-
tion ot the country, and then pathetic appeal to
them to unite with them m then efforts to reinstate
the people to their long-lost rights, could have the
privilege; and all others were excluded from the
boon As they were miss'onanes sent out by the
Federal part), they probably considered it unpio-
fitable to ínadiate the intellects ol that class of be-
nighted and vulgar beings described by the great
financier ol the Federal party, Nicholas Biddle, in
his oration delivered at Nassau Hall, Princeton,
New Jersey, into whose merciful hands the substi-
tute offered by the Senator from Virginia [Mi
Rivrs] for ihe bill under consideration, is calculated
to, and inevitably will, consign them, and therefore
were disposed to shut them out, and lo admit only
such of the people as ¿vere described by Alexander
Hamilton, in his letter to General Washington, of
the 9th September, 17D2, before alluded to, as being
the only class of men "who are in every society
the only firm supporters of Government." And,
said Mr S that the people may understand the fa-
vorable estimation m which the great financier,
Mi. Biddle, held them—who is lo be their future
protectoi if the substitute succeeds and is adopted—
he would ask the permission of the Senate to read
an extract fiom the oraiion alluded to, in which
they will find a mirror furnished by Mr Biddle, in
which they could nave a perfect view of them-
selves, as depicted by the head of the Federal party.
"From your quiet elevation, watch quietly this
servile route, as its triumph sweeps before you
Tne avenging hour will at last come it cannot be
that our nation will lona endure the vulgar do-
minion of ignorance and duplicity you will live to
see the laws eslabltshed These banditti (the peo-
ple) will be scourged back to their caverns, the
penitentiary will reclaim its fugitives in office, and
the only remembrance which history will preserve
of them, is the energy with w hich you resisted and
defeated them "
And, said Mr S while the Fedeial party, under
different names, covering the same principles, who
early lost the power, by abuse of it, which they
held bin a. short time, to rega n ii, and again ingra-
tiate themselves into the confidence of the people,
have been denouncing, villifjing, and abusing the
Democracj, with all the opprobrious epithets that
the vcMiabulary could furnish, for nearly lorty
years, and predicting, in every prominent measure
of (he Administration, destruction to the Govern-
mi nt and ruin to ihe people, thirteen new States
have been added to the Union, and settled with a
thriving, happy people , and the nation, under the
guidance of the Democratic party, with the fierce
and ferocious assaults of the Federalists to encoun-
ter, has. prospered, and increased in population, in
improvements, and grown in wealth, far beyond
any example furnished either in ancient or modern
history.
Mr S said it was not his purpose to complain
in the least ol the Opposition for the course which
they had thought proper to pursue His only ob-
ject was, in presenting it to view, that there might
be some criterion by which the people, whose inte-
rests were apparently so near to their hearts, could
ascertain how much reliance was at this time to be
placed upon the illimitable denunciations, in the
absence of argument to sustain them, of the mea-
sure under consideration.
At last, said Mr S the Opposition have disco-
vered an act more ruinous than a war with ihe
most potent nation, and more odious than the sedi-
