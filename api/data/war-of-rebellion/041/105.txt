Numbers 12. Report of Lieutenant George R. Herbert, One hundred and fifty-ninth New York Infantry, Acting Signal Officer, of operations May 27-June 13.

NEW ORLEANS, LA.,

July 28, 1863

SIR: I have the honor to transmit the following report of official messages sent and received by me during the recent campaign at Port Hudson and vicinity.

The messages were al sent from General Banks' headquarters. On the 27th of May, Lieutenant Hallett and myself proceeded to open communication with the gunboat Richmond, lying below Port Hudson which was accomplished, but did not send or receive any official messages. For several days I assisted in building stations, and on the 1st of June communication was opened all along the line, consisting of six stations.

I have him under my control. The minute he opens, I silence him.

D. G. FARRAGUT.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

The shelling by the mortar-boats on Thursday night is reported to have seriously inconvenienced the enemy. Beef-cattle killed, several men wounded, and a regimental camp rendered untenable. The bulk of the early fire passed a little to the left of and beyond the main magazine. The sleep of half the garrison was prevented.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

JUNE 6.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

Your note of yesterday received. The sextant has arrived. It will be taken care of, and returned safely. Am much obliged for your offer with regard to the boats in Bayou Sara. We heard of their safety yesterday, but would like particulars. Thanks for hand-grenades.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

JUNE 9.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

Opened fire at 11 a.m. from the heavy guns and mortars, and fired slowly during the day, with good rangers and excellent effect, driving the enemy away from the parapet. Our fire was except in one or two instances, unanswered. The navy guns were admirably served. Please keep up your mortar fire during the whole of the night. We shall fire slowly all night. Will send you report of the operations at the mouth of Thompson's Creek this evening.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.
