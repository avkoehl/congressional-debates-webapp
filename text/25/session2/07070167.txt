Making public officers depoñlaries—Mr. Brown.
Senate-
long prevalent in many parts of this countiy He
repeated, that those who were opposed to this sys-
tem of monopolies and privileges, were the real
advocates of the rights of property and of social
order, which were more in danger of being violat-
ed and ovet thrown b/ the grasping spirit and de-
moralizing influence of monopolies, than irom any
other cause
The spirit of monopoly is but true to its interests,
when it denounced all, who are opposed to its
unhallowed designs, as levellers, and as enemies
of property and social order It is here, as m
Englan', where the privileged orders brand those
v ho seeK to effect a reform of ancient abuses, as
ltvel'T  and enemies of property, with the excep-
tion that those who endeavor to imitate them in
these denunciations, in this country, afford but a
poor specimen of any thing like even a mimicry of
their English models, much less of the substance
and reality of an anstorracy, and m this countiy,
can never fail to inspiie, while our free govern-
ment exisb, but one emotion, and that the very
opposite of respect Mr B «¡aid, that the same
men, who, in this country, were found indulging
in these kinds of epithets against those who advo-
cated the doc*nnes of the present Administration
on this question, would most probably, if on the
other side of the Atlantic, be found advocating
there tne pretentions of privileged classes, and titled
orders
It there vv ere any, m the ranns of the friends of
the Administration, who had ever, m any way,
ac'voca ed the doctrines now sought to be imputed
to the partj generally, he had yet to kno v them
&U e\ en suppose that a few were to be found m
their ranks, absurd enough to entertain such op -
litems, which he did not believe, why, it would only
prove what we all know already, that there aie a
few, amon¿ all parties, who possess notions ot
eveiy variety of absurdity. Would this, there-
lore, be a ground on w hich to impute such opinions
to the same party, generally1! Why, if it were,
how would the old Federal party stand? It is now
no longer a matter of doubt, but that some of them
were monarchists m principle How would the
piesent Opposition stand? Some of their partizans,
as he should presently show, had attacked the
very principles on which popular Government rest 
According 'o the rule, by which it is sought to im-
pute to the great body ot the friends of the Admi-
nistration, the doctrines oí a few, and to make them
answerable tor them, it mignt, with equal fairness,
be alleged, that the Opposition advocated doctnnes
tending to monarchy He, however,was far, veiy
iar, fiom imputing to them, as a par'y, such doc-
trines, and, on the contiaiy, had entire confidence,
that the great body of them w ere governed b\ mo-
tive"! of patriotism He had, in repelling the charge
made on his party, only given this as an illustra-
tion of die injustice of charging a whole party with
the absurlttics ot a few, wno might happen to be
among them
Yvn , he would ask, weie the supporters uamlj
of the present Administration? They were to be
found mostly among that class of citizens, engaged
nl the peaceful and honoiable pursuits oí agricul-
tuie Men who were ever ready to fly to the sup-
port of the standard of the law, not only from rao-
uve-  of patriotism, but because all that was most
lear to them, was under the protection of the law
The friends of the Administration had as strong mo-
tives, not only from lov e of country, but from mo-
tives of interest, to resist attacks on the rights of
property, as the Opposition He believed they
would lose quite as much, by the prevalence oí
agrarian pr nctpies, as would be lost on the other
side Not, peihaps so much of that kind of wealth
which is often imaginar}, consisting in stocks and
funds, and which not unfrequently, bv its fluctua-
tions and uncertainty, by broken bankb or other-
wise, takes wmgs in the course of a few hours, and
leaves its possessor "poor indeed," but more, he
believed, m the aggregate, of that solid, substantial
interest in tht soil of the country, which is identi-
cal w ith patriotism itse'f Where, on the con-
trary, were the opponents of the Amimstration to
be mostly found? Chieflv, he believed, multes and
towns, and, although he did not doubt, but that
many among that kind of population, were as pa-
triotic and devoted to the cause of the country, and
the great principles of civil libeit), as those of any
other, yet a very large portion of them n*>re n -
cessanly mere dependant on the smiles and tavors
of 'hat class, and of the so interests, which con-
trolled the mpchmery of the paper system, m all its
ramifications, irom brokers and stockjobber--, up
to banking monopolies themselves
It had been said, m fie coarse of the debate, that
the banking system could exist nownere but m a
free Government, and that it was necessary to
the advancement oí civilization, and to the existenc 
of free goverment He denied both the facts and
the conclusions drawn from them He as-sorted,
and would maimam, tne very reverse to b° true
and more especially 1*1 regard to the quesaon c f
free government He had, from a very earlv
period of h ¡> life, doub'cd whether banking in tiln-
tions were at all compatib'e wiih tie existence of a
truly republican form of go eminent, and whether
they would not eT entuallj if not greatlv checl-e !,
oveithrow it ent rely The facts that \ er< da!y
transpiring in this country, and tr  daring and in-
solent pretensions that were now open'j set up bj
those interests, as they had increased and grown
stronger, confirmed him more and more in that
opinion That doctrines, alarming to the people of
this country, and threatening a change in sub-
stance, if not in the form, «four Gov ernnvnt, were
rapidly gaming ground, he entertained the firmest
conviction During the greater part of the ex-
istence oí the late Administration, and since the
present one has come into powei, almost the entire
Oppos,tion press, as well as manj cf those of the
same party in high public stations, have been in
the hab t of indirectiv assaulting incapacity oí the
people for self-gov eminent, by «vcasins and attacl
on their intelligence Di ctrmes ire now bold1}
announced on this subject, which, bat a few year
since, were scarcer} heard m wh spers anl that
would then have startled the public mind
He had recently seen an essay, ov er the s gna-
ture of "Sidney," republished from the Commercial
Advertiser, one oí the leading Opposition paper5,
edited m the city of New York, w hich he consider-
ed as signally indicative of the "sigosof the times,'
and as showing the tendency of the anti-republican
sentiments to which he had alluded However
averse he was generally to introducing topics into
debate having relation to newspapers, he felt that
he should stand excused, as well from the high cha-
racter w Inch the editor ascribes to the w nter of the
article m question, as ñom the e\ample« cf ge"t'e-
men m Opposition, «orne oí whom have occasion-
ally introduced to oui attentic i, ai cl"s fiom the

speaks in the highest terms of he cbaiac er if the
individual who wro'e n and as conn íg i-i i tne
pen of one w hose "ase and w ¿ dora hav e giv en us

He proposed to read one or two extracts from this
"chapter or invaluable warning ind advice," and
it would be seen that it is a bold and direct asspult
on our popular form tf Government, and is, hi ei
fact, the advocacy of a change m the s\ stem, wh ch
shall give power to the few, and taice it fom the
people    The writer of the essay alluded to sat

Here, then, said Mr Ewe have a direct assault
on the intelligence of the people, and on our pre-
sent form of Government It derives an import-
ance far bevond an ordinary newspaper essay,
from the distinct on and character ascribed by its
editor to its author It 1= but one of the many
proris of the existence of this anti republican spirit,
w men has grow n w th tne grow th, and strengthen-
ed with the strength, ot the paper «vstem in this
cuuntrv
He \ ould now return to the discussion of the
tome aheadv alluded to, the influence of the paper
s s,.em on fiee Go\ emment, and js al'eged necessi-
ty to the progress ot civ ihzatton When gentlemen
referred us to England, as an example ot vrhat the
paper sjstem had done for free Government, their
ideas of free Government and his were greatly at
variance. Me doubted wnether the great mass of
any people on earth were more ground down by
privileged orders, monopolies, and an oppressive
sjsiem of taxation, than in England He doubted
whether there was any people, where the laboring
classes nad so much of their earnings taken from
thim, and so little left to themselves and famJies
to subs! t on

Jiet, winch, to gratify cup dity and ambition, had
desolated Ireland and India in blood and carnage?
And again, he would ask, was that Government a
fit model to be appealed to, on questionsof freedom,
w hose citizens w ere not permitted to hold meetings
011 public aflairs, without first obtaining permiision
irom magis -ates, or being liable to be shot down
and dispersed bv a mili'arj force?
The comparaüv ° mriuerice of the paper svstem,
end of a currency mostly metallic, on the general
prospei ty and moral condition of nat cms, was
si-ikingly evhibned by looking at the s'a'e of tí ings

other causes, is probab't , but that it is mainly the
effect ol the much greater pievalence ot the paper
system, and of other monopolies in t,ngiand,he had
no doubt. Their tendency being to iaise U e few,
at ihe expense of the many, and consequent!) to
