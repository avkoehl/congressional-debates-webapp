Colonel SHARPE:

What information, if any, have you of troops at Hanover Court-House? Deserters from Gilmor's battalion of cavalry left there April 23, and report a large force of cavalry there and some two brigades from Army of Northwest Virginia, with more coming.

J. I. DAVENPORT,

Fort Monroe:

At date you mention Bradley T. Johnston's command-cavalry, infantry, and artillery, 700 strong-at Hanover Junction. Since then we had a rumor, not corroborated, that Londstreet sent some men from Charlottesville that way. They may have gone to Hanover Court-House, but I do not think so. It is strangle that Gilmore men should go to you to desert.

G. H. SHARPE,

Colonel and Quartermaster.

JOHN I. DAVENPORT,

Fortress Monroe, Va.:

I have a man, not late from Richmond, who can perhaps explain recent obstructions to the general's correspondence with Richmond, if they still exist. Does the general want the man, and will he be sent right back? Let me know what you consider the condition of things at Richmond, and what you know about any troops passing thought Richmond this way for the past ten days.

Captain HENRY MARIVAULT,

Commanding His Imperial Majesty's Ship Tisiphone:

CAPTAIN: I see by the Richmond papers that some officer or officers of the French ships, which at City Point, left their vellels and went Richmond, and remained there some days, and that the delay occasioned in coming down was waiting for the return of that officer or those officers. May I inquire offense whether that newspaper statement is true, and, if true, under what article of the convention regard to the shipment of the tobacco, or under what authority these officers visited Richmond?

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
