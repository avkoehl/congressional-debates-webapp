and property largely engaged in the navigation of those
waters, in the opinion of your petitioners, requires that the
signals referred to be made permanent.
Mr. CLINGM AN. The gentleman from Con-
necticut is reading the petition itself. I object.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Con-
necticut must be aware that he cannot read the
petition.
Mr. CLEVELAND. 1 am aware of the rule,
and am complying with it literally. I cannot state
the contents of the petition in fewer words than to
read it. 1
The SPEAKER. The Chair does not think
the gentleman is complying with the rule in read-
ing the petition.
Mr. CLEVELAND. Well, at the request of
my friends around me, I will yield my right,
though I would not do so merely for the gratifica-
tion of certain gentlemen who could not carry
their own motions through the other day. I will,
therefore, state verbally the substance of the peti-
tion.
Certain signals have been established on the
coast of Florida, and these petitioners ask to have
them continued, by the action of Congress, at the
expense of the Government. These signals are
deemed important, especially in that region. I now
move that the petition be referred to the Commit-
tee on Commerce, without reading, to gratify my
friend from North Carolina, [Mr. Clingman,] who
did not get through his motion the other day.
The petition was accordingly referred.

mittee on Invalid Pensions.
Mr. INGERSOLL. If it is in order, I ask the
unanimous consent of the House to withdraw from
the House the petition of Elisha Whitney, and
ask that it be referred to a select committee. '

in the regular order of business.

riah Bassett, asking for bounty land-, which he

tination.
The petition was accordingly referred to the

gentleman from North Carolina if he will allow

nothing this session, he will withdraw his objec-
tion.

him since the first of November, 1852; which,
thereupon, severally received the signature of the
Speaker.
The SPEAKER. Reports are in order from
the Committee on Elections.
JOHN S. LITTELL.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I was instructed by the
Committee on Elections, at the last session, to
submit a report on the case of John S. Littell, who
contested the seat of John Robbins at the last
Congress, but did not get an opportunity to do so.
I submit it now, and ask that the accompanying
resolution be adopted.
The resolution was read, as follows:
Resolved, That the Clerk be directed to pay to John S.
Littell his per diem and mileage, as are usually allowed to
members of Congress, from the commencement of the
Thirty-first Congress to the 11th day of September, 1850,
inclusive, the contest for a seat between him and the Hon.
John Robbins, jr., having been decided on that day.
A Member. Let us have an explanation of the
resolution.
Mr. WILLIAMS. If the resolution which
has been read by the Clerk is not passed now, in
all human probability it will not.be reached during
the remainder of the session.
The facts of the case are briefly these: John S.
Littell came to Washington at the commencement
of the Thirty-first Congress, and claimed the seat
held by John Robbins, jr. His memorial was
referred to the Committee on Elections, which
committee, after some examination of the case,
reported a resolution to the House, which was
adopted, authorizing the parties to the contest to
take testimony of witnesses in the case before any
alderman or justice of the peace in Philadelphia.
Accordingly, testimony was taken, and being
transmitted to the House, it was referred to the
Committee on Elections, which committee subse-
quently submitted to the House majority and mi-
nority reports. On the 11th of September, 1850,
the House decided in favor of Mr. Robbins, the
sitting member. The Committee on Elections,
who bad thoroughly examined the merits of the
case, were convinced that the contestant should
be paid his per diem and mileage in accordance
with the policy of Congress theretofore pursued
and reported a resolution to that effect. The
Committee on Claims of this Congress are satis-
fied he ought to receive the compensation hereto-
fore allowed in all similar cases, and, by their di-
rection, I have presented the resolution now under
consideration. I hope that it will be adopted.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I move that the
resolution be laid on the table.
Mr. MOORE, of Pennsylvania. If it is in
order, I propose to say a word or two on this res-
olution.
The SPEAKER. The resolution ia not dÂ«-
