HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,

February 7, 1865-4.30 p. m.

Brevet Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

I have just received your dispatch by Captain Emory; I had already received the same by telegraph. If I have to withdraw I would prefer to do so in the morning instead of at night. We have regained most of the ground we held yesterday, and drawn the artillery fire from the enemy's works, and we can hold the south side of Hatcher's Run toward Dabney's Mill so long as may be required.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 7, 1865-5.15 p. m.

Major-General WARREN:

The major-general commanding has received your dispatch. He is pleased to hear of your success to-day, and of your comparatively small losses yesterday. You will be withdrawn, but not at night. You new position will be to hold the tete-de-pont, to picket from Armstrong's down Hatcher's Run, and to hold your corps at points convenient to support a picket-line from Hatcher's Run to junction of Church and Halifax road, and to support the Second and Sixth Corps, if needed. You will receive the order soon. It is desirable to relieve Wheaton soon, since, he will take Hartranft's place, and Hartranft will be sent
