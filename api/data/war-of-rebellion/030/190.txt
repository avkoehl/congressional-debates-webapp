CAMP HAMILTON, December 16, 1862.

Colonel J. P. GARESCHE, Chief of Staff:

Forage train returning safe (loaded). The firing was upon a small demonstration of cavalry, purporting to be the advance guard of Buckner's division. Having been informed that a considerable force of the enemy had moved toward Franklin road, I took the precaution of sending a strong support immediately upon hearing the firing. The enemy are placing obstructions upon some of the roads, I presume, to prevent foraging. While out this morning I could hear bugle signals distinctly to my left; the woods prevented my seeing the enemy's force. My scouts have not yet returned.

GALLATIN, December 16, 1862

Colonel J. P. GARESCHE:

Nothing has been seen or heard of the enemy north of the Cumberland since Saturday, when Hamilton and Ferguson crossed the river at Hartsville, going south. My scouts from Lebanon report no force of any consequence in Lebanon, or nearer that place than Baird's Mills, where Morgan has his advanced,guard. Morgan's headquarters are still at Black Shop. Kirby Smith is at Manchester. At McMinnville there are a few,and something like 200 at Alexandria and New Middleton, gathering up forage and conscripts.
