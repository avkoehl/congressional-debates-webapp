is still at Chattanooga. Buckner gone to Knoxville. I now have three regiments at Stevenson, one this side, one at Anderson, and one at Tantalon water-tanks, sufficient to run the road. Sheridan is opening the road so that wagons lightly loaded can pass to Stevenson. The works, block-house, and stockades in good order. I want a locomotive and few platform cars to send provisions. The report about rebel cavalry proves to be false.

WINCHESTER, July 19, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

We heard this evening of a party of 500 or upward of cavalry in the country, at the head of Little Crow Creek. Colonel Ray is at Stevenson. Detachments at the bridges. Sheridan has two regiments at Anderson; he will move at daylight with the rest of his division to stir the cavalry. Stanley is too far off, but your dispatch will be sent him. The bridges will be all right. I have sent work to Stanley. Biffle across the Tennessee River.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department of the Cumberland:

The wives of Arnold Harris and Abe Buford want to go through the lines. Have no objection to it, but tell them I cannot promise to let them back. Can they go through your lines with that understanding? We have caught all Morgan's force but 700 men. Hope to get them to-night.

Nothing of interest excepting that the whole rebel community appear to be anxious and in haste to take the oath of allegiance.
