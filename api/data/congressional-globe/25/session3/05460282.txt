APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Maine Boundary Question—Mr. Legare.
Ho. of Reps.
It may be said that we entered into a treaty
with Great Britain in 1817 or 1818, limiting the
number of armed vessels that should be main-
tained by either Power on those lakes I admit
it, hut Great Britain has not invariably felt her-
self bound by that convention, for she has at least,
I am informed, an armed steam vessel in her em
ploy on Lake Ontario, two or three on the upper
lakes, and one on Lake Champlain, by which,
dunng the season of navigation, every lake town
fiom Buffalo to Detroit may be utterly destroyed
in less than one week, while we have nothing
prepared to íesist I have been struck very forci-
bly with the singular, and, to me, unaccountable
omission in this bill to make any provision for a
case of such imperious necessity I believe we
have not one piece of ordnance on that whole
frontier that could be pointed against an invading
foe I beg pardon of the House foi asserting that
we are wholly defenseless I have just been told
by the honorable gentleman fiom Michigan, who
sits near me, that the Government, in its magna-
nimity, has given to the State of Mulligan one
mne-poundei [A laugh ] All 1 ask of this House
is, that, if they deem it necessaiy to the national
honor to make a contingent declaration of war,
they will mseitin this bill some piovision for the
defense of the noi thorn frontier that shall at least
putus on a level with the Atlantic cities "We ask
no more I know there is not time to erect Ions,
but I ask, while the Piosidcnt of the United States
is authoiued in this bill to equip and employ the
whole naval force of the United States for the de-
fense of the sea coast, will not Confess authorize
him, at the samt time, to purchase, aim, nnd
equip the necessaiy number of steamboats foi the
defense of oui northern frontier' Suiely, It is
the duty of the House to do so Will they apply
a torch which must set oui whole noithtm fion-
tier in a flame, and mike no provision lor oui
defense'
It is true we have a bill authorising the erec-
tion of forts along the boundary line of Maine,
and anotftét for lepainng the dilapidated woiks
tin Lake Ontario, but, from the lepoitof the War
Dcpaitment, after sleeping a Rip Van Winkle
sleep of Unity or foity ycais, it seems they have
at length waked up to some nppie hensiun ol om
exposed condition, and they now piopose to com
menu at I\nt Niugaui a foitifieution now com-
parative ly us I  ss, and to pioeeed thence cast-
wardly, as if theie was nothing wcstoftlmt point
woith defending I shall bo pardoned forsnying
that there are more people west of a meridian line
drawn thiough Ontario, inhabiting State"! which
bordt r upon the lakes, than existed within the
whole limits of the United Slates at the time of
the Revolution, but it seems that war is to be de-
cided, and all this poition of the Union is to I e
ubandoned to its fate Why this odious distinc-
tion '
Mr HOWARD, chniiman of the Committee
on Foieign Relations, complxincd of the vn w
taken of this whole case by the gentleman liom
New Yoik The gentleman seemed to complain
veiy heavily that there, was nothing in this bill
foi the deft use of the northern fi ontic r, by watei,
but he would take .the libel ty of calling the gen-
tleman's attention to the thud section of the bill,
which empowered the Piesidcnt to put into nipu
sillón the whole naval force of the United States,
and employ itfor the national defense, and though
the bill contained no special authority foi the erec-
tion of steam batteiies, yet theie was such & Pro-
vision in another bill now before the Senate The
power of the Piesident must, of course, depend
on the amount of money placed at his dispobil,
he might employ apoition of the Navy on the
lakes, as, well as on the ocean, and vessels of wai
might be built and launched upon the lakes

The bono able cl urmin of the committee -ays
thit the con nut'ee tintler tood that the northern
fioiiner mi/ht be delendtd in one of two ways
the  Piesideut might fit out the vessels of the
Navy, and employ them in the defense of the
lakes Now there is one objection to this those
vessels may find it very difficult to ascend the
Niagara falls It is said that a certain Secretary
of War once directed vessels to be built on Lake
Ontario which were to be used on Lake Erie, en-
tirely forgetting that the falls were interposed.
It certainly will not answer to fit out vessels on
the Atlantic which are to be used on the lakes.
The bill only allows the President to complete
vessels already commenced It is true that we
had some vessels of war on Lake Eue, part of
them built by ourselves,and anotherportion con-
sisting of those taken fiom the British by Perry,
but, after the last war, these vessels were sold to
private citizens, and they are now navigating the
lakes as merchantmen The Government has not
a single vessel upon that lake moved either by
sails or steam
1 will not enter further into this argument \
trust it is quite sufficient to apprise the House of
the actual state of the case to induce them to make
some piovision (oi the defense of the northern
frontiei It suiely is not necessary for me to refer
to the exasperated state of feeling which has for
some time preveulid on both sides of the line, or
to icimnil the House that, with all the exertions
of both Governments, it has been scarcely possi-
ble to pitseive the national peice If wai shall
come upon us without pievious pieparation, we
have nothing else to ixpcct but to bee oui cities
and our villages Hid in abhes, and our citizens
muidircd Let me not, howevei, be misunder-
stood We aie fully leady to stand by Maine
in the maintenance ot hei just lights We are
willing to bare our bosims to the shafts of war
whenever the honor of the nation shall requne it
All we ask is that you shall make what provision
is in your powci for oui defense Put us upon
the same footing with the Atlantic coast The
Butish Government has in the Cañadas eighteen
thousand tioops, among the befit that the woild

MAINL BOUNDAUV QUESTION
REMARKS OF HON. HUGH LEGARE,
OF SOUTH CAROLINA,                       j
In THE IIot/SL OF Repueslntatives,
March 1, 1839,
On the bill giving the President ad htional power for the
defense ot llie United States, &c
Mt LEG'YRE said that he agreed with the
gentleman who had just taken his seat, (Mi
MENFrrc,] in the sentiment that, of all things in
the woild, a war with England was most to be
depiecateei and most to be avoided, if it could be
avoided without a sacrifice of the national honor
and character, and, ífMi L considered this bill as
a war measure, he should not be its advocate But,
so far fiom believing it to b" a war n eabiire, he
held with the gentleman fiom Maine [Mr Evans]
tint, if anv measure was calculated loavntwai,
it wis a bill of this charieti i The measuic pi o
posed was no new thing in modem times On
the contieij, the experience of a few ye-irs pnst
was full of simihi instiiices How often had the
most formul ible nnlittiy fences lie n ru td by
the nations of Euiope, not for the purj ose of
waging war, but only as a sheriff wises Iusjjo se
to execute a writ; so these armies had been raised
to cari y into effect the law of nations The
French had raised armies and had battered down
fortresses, and vet it was not held to be war
The Powers of Europe stood by and saw the de-
cree passed by their mutual agreement carried
into forcible effect The thing was done by mil-
itary force, with colors flying and drums beating,
and by the discharges of parks of artillery, but
still it was not wai, and it was this very anay of
battle by which the peace of Europe was pre-
served Gentlemen, therefore, need not be so
much alarmed, as if the House, by passing this
bill, was resorting to a war measure
Before, however, he entered into the argument,
he must first be permitted to say that he had re-
garded the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr
Biddle] as somewhat singular in the position he
had taken True, the gentleman had retracted
what he had remarked as to the braggadocio style
of the proceedings of the House
Mr BIDDLE said that he had retracted noth-
ing He had only restated what he said when
up, and he still thought it premature m this Gov-
ernment to put on military array because the
Bntish Government had assumed a position for
winch our own conduct did certainly give them
some pietext
Mr LE&ARE The gentleman admitted that
the Committee on foieign Affairs had not had in
view a duect resort to war, although he was not
without apprehensions that the measure they
advocated might lead to such a icsult The gen-
tleman ceitamly would be greatly mistaken, if
he supposed that the committee weie either dis-
posed to deal in the language of a braggadocio,
or had the remotest desne to precipitate hostili-
ty s Foi himself, Mr L could say that he had
ever been the uniform advocate of peace The
members oi the committee would bear him wit-
ness that even in our difficulties with Mexico,
when her conduct gave us a just pretext for wai,
and oui supeuonty in powei piesented a tempta-
tion to engage in hostilities, he had unifoimly
opposed a resort to aims Ihe committee had,
indeed, pn pared a manifesto to the woild, ex-
hibiting a list ol our national gnevanccs, anil the
giound of our just complaints against the Mexi-
can Govtininent, yet they had, without hesita-
tion, recommended a refeience of oui difficulties
to the aibitration of a third Power, and they
would be disposed to do the same thing now did
the time allow it The House had been told that
it was a gnat pity that they were called to pass
so suddenly on u question out of which might
giow such grave and impoitant issues And if
the House were under obligations to dibcuss at
large the whole question of oui noithcastein
boundaiy, its past history, present state, and its
whole merit, there might be something in the ob-
jection "\ct the gemlemtn fiom Massachusetts
[ \h Saltón stall] hid maintained that the ques-
tion between us tinei Gieat Bntain wis so simple
that an envoy who had never studied it might
make himself completely mister of the subject
dunng the shortest voyage that ever was mae'e
acioss the Atlantic Mi L had thought, at one
time, that the gentleman was going to say out
Government had given up possession of the dis-
puted tertitory, but when be said he would go
for the first section of the bill, he did admit that
Maine had never abandoned hei claim to the pos
sesbion oí the soil It was tiuc that neithe r the
Generil nor the State Governmentever had aban-
doned the possession of the temtory, nor the
claim to jurisdiction over it But now a subor-
dinate foreign functionaiy writes to the Governor
of Maine that he has power to oust her from
the possession of it by the force of arms
The question was a simple one The facts
were all m our own possession, and could at any
time be established Indeed, he had never heaid
them disputed until this evening Maine, then,
being established in an undoubted asceitamed
right, and her people flying to aims as one man,
the question was, whether that House had any
other choice than to do its duty in suppoit of
what was just, ai d lea' c the íesults to Heaven
Could theie be eny doubt what the law of nations
required under such cncum tances' VV hit %\ as
the language of that law ' [Mr L hero read a
passage from Vattel }   There was the law, so
