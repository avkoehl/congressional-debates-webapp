APFEHDIX TO THE BONGftESSTON&L GLOBE.
[March'l,
25th Gonb..!«.3d Sess.
Dry-Dock at Brooktynr~*-Mr. Frtxti,
•Ho. OF B.EPS.
that committee, and trust the House will be so
far influenced by its irresistible conclusions as to
«ut off all appropriations but such as the public
service indispensably demands. By a statement
of this committee, the present resources of the
Treasury for 1839 are but §28,900,000, while the
charges upon the same for the same period (in-
cluding Treasury notes issued during the last
year, to be redeemed—$7,712,350) amount to
$32,876,857, leaving a deficiency of $3,976,857.
f will, however, give the language of the com-
mittee:
" To meet this de8ciency, the Secretary of the Treasury
is authorized to sell the remaining bond of the Bank of the
United States, amounting, with interest, to $2,380,000, and
there remains $2,287,650 of the Treasuiy notes authorized
to be issued, by the act of 1838, which have not yet been
Issued.* Should the former be sold, and the limitation of
the Treasury note act of 1837 be extended to the 30th
Jane, and no appropriations be authorized during the pres
ent session but those embraced m the foregoing statement,
[which did not include an appropriation for dry docks,]
there would be an estimated balance m the Treasury on the
1st January next of about $690,000 Even this balance will
be reduced by some additions which will be necessarily
jnade during the session to the appropriations enumerated
in tlie foregoing statement Should Congress authorize the
usual amount of new appropriations, and the three millions
proposed for fortifications, hai bors, &e , it would be neces-
sary to provide five or six millions lor the f reasury, in ad
dmon to the resources and receipts existing or contení
plated "
I hope, Mr. Chairman, the House will be ad-
monished by the sentiments and opinions of the
report of the committee, that they will dispense
with, as far as possible, all extiavagance. Let us
commence with this bill, for I hold to the doctrine
that that which is not indispensable to the wants
of the service is an inexcusable extravagance.
I am of the opinion that, for the present, we can
do with one additional dry-dock. The question
•will then suggest itself to the mind, wheie shall
that site be best to enhance the public inteiest'
I will endeavor to show, hereafter, by the facts
which I have gleaned from the public documents.
Indeed, I am convinced, fiom reading this report,
that we cannot have the means of building more
than one at this time, considering the large amount
>t will cost to construct it, say (¡800,000—a large
amount,
ButI shall, in the fiist place, examine this in a
national point of view. I will throw aside Stato
pride, and merge the interest of the same into
the great national interest. This is the ground
we should all take, though, unfortunately, some
gentlemen had attempted to bring this into the
common vortex of a local scramble, without re-
gard to the public weal; but when this shall be
the issue, he would notshnnk fiom a comparison
of the sup contemplated for the creation of the
same in his Slate with that of Philadelphia, 01
any other, or relinquish the claims of his State to
that of any other State. It was deeply to be re-
gretted that this kind of legislation had too much
obtained, but it is not too late to correct it, and
the sooner we do it the better, because it will pre-
vent the great and useless expendituie or waste of
public money, which, by management and com-
promise, is applied to other than national objects;
which, in fact, íesults to the benefit of individu-
als instead of Government, and to their private
emolument. And unless it be stopped, there arc
none in this Hall who can anticipate the end, nor
foretell the always exhausted and deranged con-
dition of out public Treasury; the onerous tax-
ation to replenish it, and the consequent strife,
disaffection of the people, and their distrust of
our institutions. Whenevet I hear the question
stated that A gets more of the public money than
B, 1 feel some forebodings for the future. I feel
that, should it become a settled principle in our
Government that B shall have as much of the
money of the people as A, notwithstanding his
wants are not so great, or, hi other words, that it
cannot be applied to the use of B without a great
waste, indeed, total loss, I say I feel that the
great national interests, the Navy, the Army, and
civil service, must become dilapidated—broken
up, the commercial, agricultural, and manufac-
tuung interests will be deprived of their proper
stimulants, and this nation, like all others that
* A bill has passed the House authorizing the extension
of this act, which will make up the contemplated deficit
have preceded it, will become enervated, and
dwindle into insignificance, and be disrespected
and despised by all well-regulated Governments
on the earth. Holding this view of the subject,
what great responsibility rests upon us to use all
proper means to prevent these fatal results being
inured to, and being realized by, our posterity.
We should spurn every attempt to create in the
national Halls any other inteiests than the na-
tional interests; that which will embrace the
whole country. The States, by their inherent
and sovereign power, can regulate their own pe-
culiar interests, and thereby preserve them from
the overshadowing influence of the national Gov-
ernment.
Does not the public service require that Brook-
lyn should be first selected as a site  When 1
come to consider the immense tonnage which ar-
nves at that port and belongs to that port, both
mercantile and national, I have no misgivings in
making it the first selection, if the want of the
Navy demand another; and to prove that it does,
I will inseit below atable apposite to this subject,
showing the arrivals of vessels of war, the large
numbei repaired, &c. The repair of many of
these vessels, I have been told, has been fiequent-
ly delayed for a time for the want of a dock, and
when repaired it is at considerable expense, caused
by the removal of munitions of war, &c , and
with great delay and injury to the service, all of
which could be avoided by the construction of
one dock.
As some gentlemen have been pleased to refer
to the number of national vessels which arrived
in the port of Philadelphia and have undergone
repair at that place, the tables below will give in-
formation upon the subject, so far as relates to
Now York, as well as that city:

The result for the last two years shows as great
disparity between the two cities.
This table is for a period of eight years, and I
have no doubt, upon further examination, a series
of years will present the same result. Í do not
wish to consume the time of the House by any
comments of mine upon these facts, but trust the
members will draw their own deductions. Thus
it will be seen that the Government have been
compelled to have repaired at Brooklyn, at great
expense, without a dock, in the space of eight
years, vessels of war, whereas, if there had been
a dry-dock at that point, they could have been
repaired, in all probability, at one half the ex-
pense
I •present, also, a statement of the aggregate of
arrivals of American and foreign vessels into the
United States for 1837, by which we may see the
great advantages of the State of New Yoik over
Pennsylvania or other States, in a commercial
point of view:

The arrivals in tonnage into the State of New
York is more than ten limes as great as Pennsyl-
vania; and, in fact, constitutes one half of the
whole tonnage of the United Slates
To cany this view of the subject still further,
I have had piepaied a statement, comprising a
penod of nine years, showing the number and
tonnage of vessels entered into the pons of New
Yoik and Philadelphia, from the yeai 1829 to
1837, inclusive, and the amount of impoits, ex-
ports, and íevenue foi the same period.

The last of these totals gives the diflerence between the
tv\ o ports
The value of imports into New York, from
the 10th of May, 1837, to the 10th of May, 1838,
was $58,814,645, and that of Philadelphia but
$7,732,497, and Pensacola, the other place spoken
of, only $3,112—the imports of New York city
being moie than half of all the importation into
the United States This table, though in a con-
densed form, is comprehensive. The latter line
or total of figuies, exhibits the difference, the
great disparity in the íeceiptof revenues into the
two cities, and, to some extent, the States of New
York and Pennsylvania. Now, according to the
above tables, if we put the claims of New York
upon its commercial as well as agncultuial inter-
ests, the dry dock should be located in that State.
What a disparity does the above present between
the two places. With what pude should the
Representatives of that great State advocate her
superior claims to the favorable consideration of
Congiess.
1 will also show, by the statement below, in
parallel columns, the great disparity between the
domestic exports of the two Statcscontending for
