Major-General McCOOK:

The general commanding directs you to hold two divisions of your corps in readiness to march to-morrow morning, with three days' rations. It is probable that Franklin will be attacked and Triune threatened to-morrow. Van Dorn is reported to be concentrated at Spring Hill. Should these reports be confirmed, you will be ordered to move out on the Versailles road toward Eagleville.

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

Major General D. S. STANLEY,

Chief of Cavalry:

The general commanding directs you to start early to-morrow morning, with all your available cavalry, by the most direct route to Triune, and there, in concert with General Steedman, advance to the support of General Granger. It is reported that he will be attacked to-morrow morning. Should this prove true, you will come in on the flank of the attacking column. Whether Van Dorn attacks or not, the general commanding desires to destroy his forces in the direction of Columbia. Your movement will be supported by an adequate force of infantry. Your command should take five days' rations. Keep up constant communication with us by couriers and by the signal corps.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

Major General D. S. STANLEY,

Chief of Cavalry:

The general commanding directs me to inform you that information received from General Steedman, at Triune, of the probable intention of the enemy to attack Franklin to-morrow makes it desirable that your cavalry should start promptly at early dawn, and that the different brigades should follows each other as closely as possible, instead of later in the day, as was intended. Should Van Dorn attack Granger, it will be the business of yourself and General Steedman to fall on the enemy's flank.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. GODDARD,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
