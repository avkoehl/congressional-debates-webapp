expenditures of the prison fund. A building 100 feet long and 22 feet broad will accommodate 120 men and give a room at the end of 20 by 22 feet for a kitchen. The elevation from the floor should be nine feet, and the floor should be high enough from the ground to prevent burrowing, with a view to escape, without detection. The roof should be covered with the patent felt roofing, which is much warmer than the shingle roof. Place the bunks in three tiers. I inclose a ground plan* which will explain how I wish the building arranged. Build it balloon-fashion, no timber larger than 3 by 4 inches, except the joists for the floor, 3 by 8. Set the post in the ground and board it in vertically with battens over the intervals on the outside, and fill them with clay plaster on the inside. Sawed lathing will do for battens. The floors must be made of rough boards, but they may be made close for winter by covering the intervals on the under side with sawed lathing. It will probably be necessary to employ an experienced carpenter to superintendent the work, and if you can find carpenters in your command they can be detailed and paid at the prescribed rates. Report the progress of the work weekly. Have you received any instructions in relation to barracks for the guards?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.

WASHINGTON, D. C., October 3, 1864.

Colonel A. A. STEVENS,

Commanding Camp Morton, Indianapolis, Ind.:

COLONEL: Your weekly reports of the condition of the camp are duly received, but they do not cover the case. Many improvements are spoken of as necessary, but nothing is said of any steps taken to meet these necessities. If you can make the improvements without reference to this office, why is it not done? Or, if it is requisite to submit plans and estimates, let it be done without delay.

Lieutenants Davidson in his report of the 18th ultimo, says, "many of the prisoners being entirely destitute of blankets and almost destitute of clothing, &amp;c. " This report is referred by you without comment, and if this state of things exists it shows great neglect. Paragraph 12 of the circular of April 20 provides for supplying prisoners with clothing, and you should always have a sufficient supply on hand. Send in your requisitions immediately.

On the 14th ultimo I instructed you as to the extension of the hospital, but your report makes no allusion to the work.

I do not know whether you have made the improvements on the old barracks estimated for in your letter of August 16, 1864. If you have not, let them be made at once. If more barracks are required for the winter, submit a plan of them with an estimate of the cost.

Vague suggestions of what is required or recommendations without details are of no value.

Acknowledge the receipt of the letter by telegram and make the required reports at once.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.
