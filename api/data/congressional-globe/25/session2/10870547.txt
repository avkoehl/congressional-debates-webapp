4mpWed in the cultivation of r-otfon m Alabama and Missis f
sippi, for the last few years, the profits have been more l fluent-
ly higher than forty percent tho.n lower than twen'/ The
profits are enormous, ->nd theie ate nd goU mines m tl e worlJ
that are realizing such considerable piofits from the capita
invested, as is being acquired from the cultivation of cotton on
the cotton lands of the ¡Southwes ern region of the Umo i
Not only has the cultivation ol the land pioved profitable,
But the Speculations in land uncultiva'ed have been, in most
¿apes, equally so I would ask if thei e are nof many y\ no haTe
purchased land of the Government at the trifling price of one
Miar and twenty five cen a per acre \  ho have reah 'ed large
profits from it i Are there not geivlemen vvithin the oundof
my voice who have purchased la dcfthe Government, within
the last twelve months, and haveieahzed moie than a hundred
per cent upon it 1 Are there not g tlen en in this Capitol who
have purchased land w ithin the la j ear at SI ¿5 per acre, w ho
have since sold it, realizing by th" sale mote than seven hun
dredper cent ' invoice in my nsrh* says yes t moie than a
íhóusandper cent) I believe i IhisI know to be the fact,
¿nd yet I do exp ci that many ¿ientb men wnl be found m the
negative vote upon these íesoiu ion*.
Speculations in land to carried m now to i >r>o t unexpected
extent at the present pnces, redice ti e pnce, and adv i turers
in that pursuit vill increase to an extc it which will mme land
jobbing, instead of lrugal cultivation, the busmen of many
thousands who have capital or cred t to use, and thiow into tne
hands of large capitalists a va t amount of land, whica will be
sold, as is too much the ca e alieaiy, m fcma.ll parcel*, to «et
tiers, at a very advanced price The pie^cnt ¿uw price of pub
lie land has not been calculated to impiove the mode of cultiva
tiíig the sod in the Unite 1 State>, a id to reduce the pnce will
induce furthei neglect Th*> present opri^tion oi the sj stem has
been to induce those who put chase to ^uvlarge tracts of land cut
down the timber, and, by a rap d bUues&ion of crops, to exhaust
the soil without íeplenishing or ennching it, but, as foon ¿,3 it
becomes exhausted, to di«caid it leave it an exhausted waete,
and then purchase fresh lands for $1 25 íenew the same opei
ation upon those and m turn discaid them 11 is has been the
case to a great extent in 1 <wen in T?rne^r>p, it thi=i moment
there are vast quantities ol lands whicn have been thus uised
and abused, and are now ca led v\ as^ oi discarded lands I! a

Human passions are ever operated upon by designing men to

like argumenta and kindred hopes. Though laws may change
With the ever changing condition of society, yet the laws of hu-
