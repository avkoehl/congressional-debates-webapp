The enemy landed some four or five regiments yesterday morning on James Island, and made a demonstration on our works. They were checked and repulsed, and have retired. * * * But to do it I had to detain one day the Twentieth South Carolina Regiment and two battalions of Florida infantry. They will go on now without delay. The Twentieth South Carolina and Florida battalions were on the point of taking the cars for Virginia. I think it fortunate that I had an opportunity of exhibiting their strength with only one day's delay.

Bonaud's battalion has been detained at Savannah a few days because of the threatening aspect of affairs there. Night before last orders were telegraphed to General McLaws to send it on without delay, but yesterday General McLaws telegraphed that several gun-boats and an iron-clad had approached Beaulieu, and transports were seen going south from here (one, at least, with troops on board), and this morning the Ironsides and two other steamers have crossed the bar, apparently going south, probably to Savannah to look after the Water Witch, or make some attack. Can I retain Bonaud's battalion longer?

Major-General Foster has recently assumed command of U. S. forces on this coast; is now on or near Folly Island. I suspect he will attempt some enterprise against us. A large transport landed troops on Folly Island yesterday. Spies and recent deserters have no doubt informed them of our weakness. Neither of the artillery companies ordered to me by Special Orders, Numbers 105, current series, from Adjutant and Inspector General's Office, have arrived; nor have I yet a man of the South Carolina reserves. Three artillery companies have been disbanded on James Island, and I cannot supply their places. This is a serious loss just at this time. This place will be in great danger if the enemy concentrates his troops on this coast against it. Can anything be done to aid me? Cannot General Johnston send me re-enforcements in a pressing emergency?

The movements of the enemy decidedly indicate an attach on some point near here. Troops are concentrating on Folly Island. My
