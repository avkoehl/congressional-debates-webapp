Reports of Brigadier General John Buford, U. S. Army, commanding First Cavalry Division.
HEADQUARTERS,Morton's Ford, October 11, 1863-6 a.m.

I arrived here about 8 p.m. Was delayed by bad roads and darkness. My supports are not to be found. Rumor says they have marched back to Culpeper. I shall remain for further instructions.

We found a small regiment of infantry and the dismounted men of Fitz. Lee's brigade.

Very respectfully,

J BUFORD,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

Major-General PLEASONTON.
HEADQUARTERS,Brentsville, October 14, 1863-5.30 p.m.

I feel uneasy about the wagons. I found the Sixth and Third Corps trains here, and all excited. The Cavalry Corps train is still in park here on account of the road being blocked up I have a regiment that has passed Union Church on the Dumfries road en route to Wolf Run Shoals. Saw nothing. Will do the best I can, but the train is so large and so badly conducted that I apprehend trouble. I do not know even now on what roads the trains are moving, and night is upon us.

Respectfully,

J BUFORD,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

Major-General PLEASONTON.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,Oak Hill, October 15, 1863.

Night is on us, and the trains not yet across Bull Run. I will do all I can to keep the enemy back. I cannot do much in the night, but will do all I can.

J BUFORD,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General PLEASONTON.

[Indorsement.]

General MEADE;

Would it not be well for General French to send a brigade of infantry to Wood Yard Ford at daylight.*

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General.

*Buford was notified by dispatch of 6 p.m. that French had been ordered to send a brigade of infantry to his support at once.
