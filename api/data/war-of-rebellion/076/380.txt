Major-General SHERMAN:

Johnson is moving. Did not get started until after 3. I hear nothing from him but light skirmishing.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Before Atlanta, Ga., August 5, 1864--7.15 p. m.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: Your dispatch is received. I am compelled to acknowledge that I have totally failed to make any aggressive movement with the Fourteenth Corps, and have very little hope of being able to do better. The efforts of yesterday and to-day on this flank have been much worse than mere failures. I have ordered Johnson to relieve Hascall this evening, and propose to-morrow to take my own corps on-to the right and try to recover what has been lost by two days' delay. The force may very likely be too small.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., August 5, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

Very well; take your divisions and order in writing both Generals Baird and Morgan to follow your movement, either in support or in echelon, with General Johnson to hold the tete-de-pont, push out for the Sandtown road, and, if possible, a position where you can control the railroad. I will have General Palmer come up, and, if he wants to resign, will consent; in which case General Johnson will remain as corps commander until other promotions can be made. Try and make an early start; the delay may have deceived the enemy, unless he can see your force. Those divisions of the Fourteenth Corps are the strongest and best in the army, and all they want is a good leader. Give direction to your movement, and they will support your flank perfectly. I will see that Generals Thomas and Howard occupy the attention of the whole line.

W. T. SHERMAN,
