of the war by scouting parties who were not very particular so that they brought in a prisoner. Heretofore it has been well to keep them to exchange for better men, but now that they are no longer required for that purpose I would suggest that all against whom there are not grave charges be released on their taking the oath of allegiance.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Lieutenant Colonel Eighth Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

[First indorsement.]

Respectfully referred to the Secretary of War.

It appears to the Quartermaster-General that on taking the oath of allegiance these prisoners could be properly released.

M. C. MEIGS,

Major-General.
