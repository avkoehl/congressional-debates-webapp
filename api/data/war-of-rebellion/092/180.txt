Numbers 63. Report of Brigadier General James D. Morgan, U. S. Army, commanding Second Division. HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Savannah, Ga., December 29, 1864.

COLONEL: *

November 14, marched at daylight, passing to the right of Kennesaw Mountain and bivouacked at Nickajack Creek, twenty miles. November 15, moved at daylight to Atlanta, twelve miles. November 16, left Atlanta at 11 a. m., passing through Decatur and bivouacking at Snapfinger Creek, marching ten miles. November 17, moved at 7 a. m. through Lithonia to Conyers, seventeen miles, and destroying five miles of railroad. November 18, marched at daylight, crossing Yellow River by Covington to Ulcofauhachee River, fifteen miles, destroying three miles railroad. November 19, marched at daylight, passing through Newborn to Shady Dale, nineteen miles. November 20, left camp at 7 a. m., marching to Eatonton Factory or Little River, fifteen miles. November 21, marched at daylight, crossing Mud Creek and camping at Cedar Creek, marching eighteen miles. November 22, in camp. November 23, moved at daylight and camped near Milledgeville, fifteen miles. November 24, left camp at 10 a. m., passing through Milledgeville and crossing the Oconee River and camping at Town Creek, nine miles. November 25, moved at daylight, crossing Buffalo Creek and camping at Keg Creek, marching twelve miles. 26th, moved at daylight for Sandersville. About four miles west of that place my foragers were met by Wheeler's cavalry, who were disposed to resist their advance. The foragers were soon formed and deployed as skirmishers, and steadily drove the enemy to and through Sandersville, never checking the advance of the column. As a precautionary measure the One hundred and thirteenth Ohio, Captain Jones commanding, of the Second Brigade, were deployed as skirmishers on the left of the road; one division of the Twentieth Corps entered the town simultaneously with my own. 27th, marched at 7 a. m., crossing the Ogeechee Rivere, camping on Hudson's plantation, marching sixteen miles. 28th, left camp at daylight, crossing Rocky Comfort Creek, camping at Louisville, nine miles. Remained there during the 29th and 30th. while at Louisville six wagons, under charge of Lieutenant Coe, acting assistant quartermaster, were attacked use outside of picket-line by Wheeler's cavalry, and four wagons captured, the remaining two escaping within the lines, followed by the enemy. Captain Dunphy, with Company [G], Tenth Michigan Infantry, waited coolly their approach; when within close range fired, killing 1 lieutenant, 2 privates, and wounding 2 (1 mortally); promptly charging, recaptured the four wagons. The captain is a cool, gallant soldier, and commands brave men. Reports being made that there was a large body of Wheeler's cavalry in my front, Lieutenant-Colonel Pearce, commanding Second Brigade, was ordered forward. The enemy did not wait for a close approach of deployed infantry, but made a rapid retreat. Lieutenant-Colonel Langley, commanding Third Brigade, with two regiments of his command, had previously driven a party of cavalry from his front on the Alabama road, killing a captain and one private. I had no further trouble with Wheeler's command.
