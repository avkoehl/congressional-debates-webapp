good grass for animals at a sufficient distance from the road to watch emigrants, and also the greatest abundance of salmon. In this respect it excels any stream entering Snake River that I know of. There is an old and much traveled trail leaving Snake River near Fort Hall, called the Bannock Trail, which is used by roaming and hostile bands who wish to change the scene of their depredations and prevent suspicion as to what tribe they belong. It touches this river about seventy miles from the mouth. The command will resume the march in Fort Walla Walla, and reach that post probably about the 1st of November. It continues in excellent health.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. F. MAURY,

Colonel First Oregon Volunteers.

HDQRS. EXPEDITION AGAINST THE SNAKE INDIANS,Camp Numbers 67, on Owyhee River, October 11, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to report that my command arrived here yesterday in tolerably fair condition. Since leaving Bruneau the feed for animals has been very scarce, in consequence of which our stock is considerably reduced. I found Captain Mason encamped here with his company, in charge of additional supplies received from Fort Boise for my command. I shall remain here only-days and again resume the march. Major Rinearson leaves here to-day to assume command of Fort Boise. I have kept scouting parties out during the march from Bruneau River, but have succeeded in finding no Indians.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. F. MAURY,

Colonel First Cavalry Oregon Volunteers, Commanding.
