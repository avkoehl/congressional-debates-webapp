General WRIGHT:

Enemy attempted to recover their picket-line by a dash this morning before day. Were handsomely repulsed. We took about sixty prisoners. Fifty-five well men have reported, and a number of their dead and wounded are in our front and possession. My loss, nine prisoners. My picket-line on the left still holds them in their works. Am establishing batteries and making reconnaissance for further action. Per last accounts [2 a.m.] Sheridan was driving Pickett. Have you a brigade still this side of the slough on my left?

E. O. C. ORD.
