Major General C. C. AUGUR,

Commanding First Division, Baton Rouge:

SIR: We encountered the enemy, what there is left of his infantry, cavalry, and artillery, at Bayou Vermillion. He masked his batteries and sharpshooters and fired on Grover and Dwight, who occupied opposite banks and were engaged in a reconnaissance. They were ultimately driven off. We sustained some loss, but the enemy's was much greater. They have destroyed the bridge, which will be reconstructed with some difficulty and delay our march a few hours. We shall resume it at the earliest moment and press a vigorous pursuit of the enemy.

I desire you to observe closely the movements of the enemy at Port Hudson, especially in the direction of New Orleans.

You will make offensive demonstrations every day int he direction of Port Hudson, with the view and effect of deterring him from weakening his forces there.

Let it be understood that we shall be down upon him before he knows it and from and unexpected quarter. All these things are important, and must not be neglected.

Relying with confidence on your vigilance and activity, I am, very truly, yours,

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.
