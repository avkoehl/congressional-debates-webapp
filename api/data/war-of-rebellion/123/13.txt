necessary in the construction, repair, and protection of military telegraph lines, and will furnish to the employes connected with those lines transportation, rations in kind, fuel, lights, stationery, and shelter, such as are allowed to other Government employes.

By order of the Secretary of War:

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

CINCINNATI, OHIO, April 8, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

My work here is now fairly under way. I will leave it in Mr. Jeffrey's care and take Mr. Shields to-morrow to New Albany to aid me in procuring a boat and commencing work there.

Respectfully,

CHAS. ELLET, JR.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, D. C., April 8, 1862.

CHARLES ELLET, Jr.,

Cincinnati:

Call on Mr. Burnett, mayor of New Albany. He and a committee there will aid you. Notify me of your arrival there.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

PITTSBURG, PA., April 8, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Mr. Ellet telegraphs from Cincinnati for one barge and 9,000 cubic feet of oak. Barge and timber cost about $35,000. Shall we purchase? Work on steamers progressing rapidly. River rising. Plenty of water. Have no instructions from Quartermaster-General.

WM. K. NIMICK.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, D. C., [April 8,] 1862.

WILLIAM K. NIMICK,

Assistant Quartermaster, Pittsburg:

You will please purchase whatever you think is needed for your own work. The immense pressure on the Quartermaster-General's Office has no doubt occasioned the delay in sending instructions. His attention will be called to the matter to-morrow morning. I have already drawn one requisition on the Treasury in your favor for $25,000, and will supply funds whenever you estimate upon me. Urge on the work. We have glorious news from the West, and hope soon to send a shout back from the Chesapeake.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
