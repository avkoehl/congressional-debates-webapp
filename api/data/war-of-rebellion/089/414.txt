You will at once begin to withdraw your division, moving left in front, and keeping well closed up. You will mass your division near Fort Cummings (the place where we cross Parke's line). As soon as you begin to move commence to withdraw your picket-line, beginning on the left and closing it in to the right. Let Colonel Osborn report to me when it is all gone. I shall be at the cross-roads, where we go into the cut we made through the woods.

Respectfully,
