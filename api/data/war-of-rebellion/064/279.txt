His Excellency A. LINCOLN,

President:

I have received from General Rosecrans information of most vital importance to the Government, which cannot be conveyed to you in its full important by mail or by express. I think it very important that you summons General Rosecrans or Colonel J. P. Sanderson, his provost-marshal, to Washington immediately.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have just seen telegram of Brigadier-General Ewing, ordering Major Bartlett with his battalion to Saint James, in my district, stating that Major Bartlett's command would still be in his (General Ewing's) district; he would not report to General Guitar. How Major Bartlett, stationed at Saint James, can be in Saint Louis District and subject to the orders of Brigadier-General Ewing, I can't understand. I have the honor most respectfully to request an explanation.

O. GUITAR,

Brigadier-General.
