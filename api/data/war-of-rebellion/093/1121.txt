I am, your most obedient servant,

Captain J. N. ANDREWS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps:

CAPTAIN: The captain commanding reconnaissance toward Lewisburg and Cornersville reports having driven in the enemy's pickets soon after crossing Duck River, at "Morse's Ford" (as I read it), and are now following them, skirmishing. He also reports, on what Major Yound, Fifth Iowa (who forwards this report, under date of 9.20 a. m.), says is good authority, a brigade of rebel cavalry encamped within two says is good authority, a brigade of rebel cavalry encamped within two miles, and that Wheeler and Forrest are moving in that direction (eastward); this is coming report of citizens. Colonel Capron says he has ordered the force across the river to push the enemy sufficiency to develop their force.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. W. JOHNSON,

Brigadier-General.
