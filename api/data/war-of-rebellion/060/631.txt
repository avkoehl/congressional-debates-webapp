The last report I had from the party was to the effect that it could not be ascertained that any of the enemy had crossed the river. My party is still out. The officer commanding Third Cavalry Division only learns of two men having come over near Germanna at about 12 o'clock last night.

I have investigated the cause of the alarm last night, and found it to have arisen from the vedettes firing on a patrol which the enemy had established on taking away the cavalry pickets opposite Colonel Humphrey's house. Two scouts are reported to have crossed at the same time.
