General TURNER,

Chief of Staff:

Transportation will be ready to-morrow for 2,000 infantry and 300 cavalry. Have the expedition ready to embark by 12 m., at Varina or Deep Bottom, as may be most convenient. No transportation, except five ambulances to 1,000 men, will be taken.

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES, March 3, 1865. [Received 11.20 a.m.]

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Twenty-seven deserters from Bratton's [South Carolina] brigade came in last night. They say they had orders to be ready to move, but I think it was to send them to some place where they could not desert, as eight came in from that brigade the day before.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES, March 3, 1865. [Received 11.20 a.m.]

Colonel T. S. BOWERS:

In General Grant's first telegram to General Turner no mention is made of an infantry force. The second dispatch, 10.30 a.m., it is stated that transportation will be ready for 2,000 infantry and 300 cavalry. I inferred the infantry also to come from this command. Will rations be put aboard of the steamers, in addition to what the men carry on their persons?

JNO. GIBBON,

Major-General.

Major General JOHN GIBBON:

General Grant's first telegram to General Turner asks for one picked brigade of infantry and one regiment of cavalry. The omission was a cipher mistake. It also directs that the men take ten days' rations with them.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES, March 3, 1865-12.30 p.m.
