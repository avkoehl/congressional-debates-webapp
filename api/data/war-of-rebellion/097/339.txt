Since this was received Colonel Porter has returned from Sheridan. He says that Devin had been driven back in considerable confusion south of J. Boisseau's house. Crook was then going up west of the road and expected to turn the enemy and drive him back. The effort has been to get our cavalry onto the White Oak road west of Dabney's house. So far this has failed, and there is no assurance that it will succeed. This will make it necessary for Warren to watch his left all very care full about coming round much in his rear, but he cannot be too much on his guard. Let your provost question prisoners as to whether troops from North Carolina have come up.

DABNEY'S MILL, March 31, 1865.

Major-General MEADE:

The following dispatch forwarded for your information:

CAVALRY HEADQUARTERS,

March 31, 1865-2.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

GENERAL: Hoke's division and three brigades of Pickett's division are at the Five Forks, or were there last night. Their picket-line is now in front of Devin's division. W. H. F. Lee attacked Smith's brigade, of Crook's division, on Chamberlain's Creek, and got cleaned out. I will now attack him, and push the First Cavalry Division against their infantry line. I have ordered up one brigade of Custer's division, which is yet back with our ammunition train. It has been impossible to get up this train on account of the swamps.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865-7.10 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

It is not impossible troops may have been sent up from the south, though I have heard nothing of it before. One prisoner said he heard Pickett's division had come up from Burkeville, but as I knew Pickett had not been there I presumed he had been down the South Side Railroad to watch for our cavalry. If Hoke or any considerable force of infantry is in Sheridan's front it opens the rear of our army, as I understood from Captain Sheridan, the bearer of this, that the road from I. M. Brock's [J. M. Books'?] to R. Bisseau's to the Boydton plank is now open to the enemy. General Sheridan, I think from the account of Captain Sheridan, will be pressed to-morrow. He will either have to come in or support must be sent to him. My line is so extended and flank in air that I don't see how I can detach for this purpose, unless I contract my lines, when I shall have troops to spare. Let me hear as soon as possible what you desire done.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
