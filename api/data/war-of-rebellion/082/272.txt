Brigadier General O. S. FERRY,

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: The brigadier-general commanding directs that you send eight companies of the One hundred and forty-eighth Regiment Ohio National Guard, stationed at Bermuda Hundred, to City Point, Va., to report to Lieutenant-General Grant's chief of staff. Two companies of the regiment will remain at Bermuda Landing as a garrison. As the battalion must be ready to move at daylight to-morrow morning, the order for the movement should be sent direct to the colonel of the regiment. I am also instructed to direct you to move all the 100-days' regiments encamped near the line of entrenchments on the left to the right of Battery No. 8, so as to make room for some colored troops that have been ordered to encamp near the line on the left, between Battery No. 8 and the Appomattox. The colored troops will not be subject to detail either for fatigue or picket duty.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. H. JACKSON,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Inspector-General.
