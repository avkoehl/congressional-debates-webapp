that the charge biought by Mr Bell against the
Senate was now pioven to be unfounded
The resolution was then put on its thud reau-
¡112, and tin question being on its passage,
Mr DROMGOOLE called foi the yeas and
nays, but they were refused, and the resolution
was. passed without a division

to hiu stivices XI  had no dene to wound the
feelings of any gen It mm, nor would he debate
the piopikfyofth resolution itself, but if others
enteied into that qjtstion, he should claim an
equal ngnt todo so
Mr PRCM1SS, ot Mississippi, said that he
had come to the House piepmed to expect the
offering of such a resolution. He had seen in-
dications of its coming, and he had come pre-
pared also to offer an amendment to the resolu-
tion, and to sustain that amendment, winch he
should do, if left to sustain it alone
Mi P said he was unwilling, at this hour,
when they were about so shortly to leave that
Hall, to allude to anything which might excite
unpleasant reminiscences He considered this
resolution as not a mere matter of form It had
been claimed to be a mere act of parting courtesy,
usual at the ttnniiiation of every Congiess; if it
weic that, and nothing more than that—if it were
the meie touching of the cap oi extending the
hind tothe ¡Speakei who was letinng from office—
Mr P would not oppose or object to it He
was foi encouiagmg the comtesies of life, and
they had seen quttt enough, during the ptesent
session, to convince them of the necessity of do-
ing so, but this was a peculiar case, to which the
rult s of nine courtesy did not apply Mi P

To begin with the Committee on Foreign Af-
fans. How stood parties there > There weie six
Administration men to three of the Opposition.
Was this—Mr P put it to gentlemen—was this
a fan representation of the balance of parties in
the House itself Then there was the Commit-
tee of Ways and Means, every one admitted its
importance as standing at the head of the finances;
and how was it constituted-' Here again it was
six to thiee But what was the constitution of
the Committee of Elections ' Everybody knew
that a place on that committee had been no sine-
cure this Congiess, so fai from it, the acts and
reports of that committee had shaken the pillars
| of this Government, as the blind Sampson shook
I the pillars of Dagon's temple, if they had not
been absolutely thrown down, they had at least
been shaken to their foundation. It was a com-
mittee in which, of all others, the strictest im-
paitiahty was demanded, for there it was that
the demon of party was most likely to rear its
hydra head And how did this committee—a
committee of judges—how did it stand' Seyen
tomo Yes, seven to two, and that was this
fepe ikor's (í ímnaitiality'" Well,how stood the
ca t with the Judicial y Committee 5 Hereagain
it was s ven to two, if the distinguished gentle-
nnii from Vngit)la was to be lankfd with the
Admmistiation but as a clnngt had taken place
since the constitution of the committee, it stood,
on the most favor ible statement, si\. to thiee.
H le, thtn, undti the action of this most impai-
tial Speakei, the foui most impoitant committees
of the House were so constituted as to give the
Admnustiation paity, as its vtiy smallest major-
ity, iiio to one, and the most impoitant of them
a.l!,j*n a poht cal point of view, had seven on the
one side, and but two on the other
Mi P did not mean to be understood as dero-
gating in the slightest dtgree fiom the character,
tu leflttting on the conduct, of the membeis of
tlusi committees, far from it They acted, no
doubt, at cm dm to their own views of public
duty He spoke only of the balance of political
power in thost committees collectively But how
stood matttis in those committees which exerted
no p-nty or political influence' Oh1 there he
found quite a different statt of things The Com-
mittit on Manufactu es contained ci^ht Whigs to
oup Administt itton man JNow, if their duty had
been to inanuf ictuie politics, did any man btl eve
that suchapiopoition would have been observed?
Oh, no, tht bal met would have been fai different.
I hen thtie came the Committee on Roads and
Canals—a committee which, however useful or
impoitiiit, exeited no political influence, and it
c nuaiiied seven Whigs Heie thepioportion was
st ven to two So m the Committee on Revisal
and Unfinished Business, seven to two. In the
little Committees on Expenditures m the vauous
Dt partnu nts, it was still largei, some of these
w < it all Whigs j>iow, did not this show design'
Was theie not a reason for so gieat a contrast?
It showed a dchbeiately-adopted principle of
action, followed out tlnough the whole selection;
and this by a S| takei on whose own election to
the chan tht House had been so ecpially divided
that his tltt tion had been earned by thirteen votes
only out of two hundied and forty-seven After
this, could Mr P vote to declart that this officer
had bton " impattial" in cxeici&mg his great and
most i esponsible power ? This was m the appoint-
mtnt of committees, and then, as to other cases,
wheie the House had been equally divided, and
the castm  vote ot the Chair decided the question
one way oi the other, would any gentleman point
him to a single instance, whethei of greater oi of
minoi impoitanct—whether the decision swept
away tht whole political lights of a State, or lec-
ogm/td tne official claims of the Globe newspa-
pei, oi st tth d the smallest question, where the
vote hail not invaiiably been given in one direc-
tion ?
Ml P did not deny the capacity of the Speak-
er, his dispatch of business, oi his full and thor-
ough knowledge of parliamentaiy law—he con-
teded all this—but it was the fac's he had just
quoted on which M P took his stand, and de-
nied, utteily, the "impartiality" of the Chan.
And he revei would, out of mere courtesy, m-
doise a tool of the Executive, or a tool of the
puty
