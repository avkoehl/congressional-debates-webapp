but, as Robert Granger telegraphs Boyle that 500 rebel cavalry are reported between Scottsville and Glasgow, going toward railroad, I have instructed latter, if he credits report to delay the movement till those regiments can be replaced by other cavalry. General Rosecrans does not credit your information in regard to Morgan.

H. G. WRIGHT,
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, December 5, 1862

Brigadier General J. T. BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

If you credit Granger's report in regard to enemy's cavalry, you will stop the movement of the Second Michigan and Ninth Pennsylvania till you can replace them by other mounted troops, and you will employ them meanwhile to guard railroad bridge, if needful. Hasten mounting of Sixth Kentucky and the movements of the Twelfth Kentucky as much as possible.

General Stanley and I are very anxious to have Mann's Seventh Michigan Cavalry, now armed and equipped at Detroit, ordered to this army, which is lamentably deficient in cavalry and cavalry arms and equipments. Do grant us this request.
