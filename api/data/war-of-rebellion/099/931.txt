SPECIAL HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT AND FIELD ORDERS, ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE, Numbers 67. Near Mill Creek, N. C., March 21, 1865.

In accordance with Special Field Orders, Numbers 33, headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, a temporary depot for the command will be established near Neuse River at the first practicable approach east of Wilmington and Weldon Railroad. All wagons not necessary for immediate use now filled with surplus camp and garrison equipage, or other surplus stores, will be sent to this depot and unloaded, and will then proceed to Kinston for supplies. One regiment will be sent from each corps to the depot as a guard, and the senior officer will have command of the depot. As soon as General Schofield's forces have occupied Goldsborough, Captain C. B. Reese, chief engineer, will lay the pontoons over the river, and with a view to that purpose will have the line of the river reconnoitered to-day. As soon as the wagons of the Left Wing have passed to our right rear, it will be necessary for the Right Wing to take roads south of the one by Cox's Bridge. The roads leading from the center of the Fifteenth Army Corps, where the guide board reads, "Twenty miles to Goldsborough," will be put in repair by the pioneers of that corps. Captain Reese will have all the routes from this point to the depot reconnoitered to-day, and will advise corps commanders.

By order of Major General O. O. Howard:
