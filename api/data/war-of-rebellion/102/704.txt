HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,May 31, 1865-2. 20 p. m.

General DODGE,

Fort Leavenworth:

The Indians said to be assembled in the Black Hills are Cheyennes, Arapahoes, and Sioux, and are there to fight Sully. This report is brought by a Sioux Indian. I don't know how reliable it is. I send to-day copy of a letter from Sully about it. He does not seem to attribute great value to the report. It must be attended to however. I will write to-day by mail.

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.
