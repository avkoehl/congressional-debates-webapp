far as Bowling Green, and then immediately returned, a portion going to the right of Grant's army and another portion coming down to the Pamunkey and crossing at Hanovertown. They commenced crossing at 9 o'clock this morning, and when last heard from were in vicinity of Haw's Shop. They could hear of no infantry crossing, and had a view of the enemy's column of cavalry crossing, and crossed the river themselves at 10.30 o'clock this morning at Newcastle Ferry. At last accounts the enemy had halted near Haw's Shop. I write from the crossing of Hanover Court-House and Mechanicsville road with the road from Haw's Shop that crosses the Central Railroad at Leech's saw-mill.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FITZ. LEE,

Major-General.

OAKWELL, near Atlee's, May 27, [1864]--9 p. m.

General R. E. LEE:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that a scout just returned from the other side of the Pamunkey reports as follows:

Saw two brigades of infantry pass on road from Chesterfield to Mangohick. Saw them at Needwood. Artillery passed immediately after. Captured and brought over one prisoner from Third New York Battery, attached to Sixth Corps. He reported his corps then passing, and thought that Burnside had passed on a road to his rear. His battery left camp at 6 p. m. yesterday and marched all night.

Scout saw this column from 8.30 to 10.30 a. m., and it was still passing when he left. Enemy still picket Pamunkey near Hanover Court-House; also has pickets on Hanovertown road, three miles from Hanover Court-House. Enemy's pickets are also two miles from Haw's Shop, on road to Doctor Shelton's. Can't hear of any infantry crossing at Hanovertown. Our cavalry is massed here now, with the intention of moving toward Hanovertown in the morning. Lomax is still at Hanover Court-House with his brigade alone. I have sent scouts to cross Pamunkey into King William, and in a great many other directions, and hope to keep you advised. I inclose you a dispatch just received from Stringfellow.*

Most respectfully,

FITZ. LEE,

Major-General.

Will Colonel Taylor please acknowledge the receipt of this.

HEADQUARTERS LEE'S CAVALRY DIVISION,Near Hanover Court-House, [May] 27, 1864--12 p. m.

General R. E. LEE:

I am two miles below Hanover Court-House. The enemy does not seem inclined to advance farther this way. I think perhaps it is a demonstration to cover a movement toward Mechanicsville, or by Haw's Shop across both railroads in the direction of Ashland. They still have pickets on the Pamunkey opposite Hanover Court-House, and may cross at any moment. If I find that they are really moving in the direction suggested toward the railroads, it will cause a division
