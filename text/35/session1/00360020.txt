Compared with the service on 30th June last,
there appears to be a decrease of 791 miles in the
length of routes, and. 893,034 miles in the annual
transportation, while the costisincre«sed#120,044.
In New England the annual transportation by-
railroad is decreased 885,876 miles; but this is
more nominal than real, owing to the fact that a
great portion of this grade of service in that sec-
tion has heretofore been stated at twelve trips a
week, the contracts requiring the conveyance of
mails as often as the cars run, while really but
six trips were performed. Now, however, the
service is reported as actually existing, and there
is no reduction of mail facilities.
The cost is increased $61>043.
Steamboat transportation is increased 147,784
miles, at a cost of $13,918.
Coach transportation is decreased 320,474 miles,
but the expense increased $5,074.
Inferior grades of service are increased 360,925
miles in annual transportation, and $22,405 in
cost.
In New York the railroad transportation is
increased 293,328 miles, at a cost of $10,268.
Steamboat service decreased 161,664 miles, at a
decreased cost of $7,501. Coach service de-
creased 143,384 miles, but the cost increased
$12,642. Inferior service decreased 113,673miles,
and cost increased $2,197.
On the 30th of June last there were in service
406 route agents, at a compensation of $310,900;
45 local agents, at $28,488; and 1,335 mail mes-
sengers, at $160,425; making a total of $499,813.
This amount, with the increased cost of service
commencing the 1st of July, under now contracts,
($120,044,) added to the cost of service as in oper-
ation on the 30th June last, ($6,622,046,) makes
the total amount for the current year $7,241,903.
This is independent of the cost of ocean mail
service.
There should also be added the estimated cost
of improvements made since 1st July last (in-
cluding the San Antonio and Sail Diego route,)
$587,825.
I have caused to be put in operation a steam-
ship route, twice a month, between San Francisco
and 01ympia,and a weekly line on Pu£fit Stfund.
Also, a tri-weekly steamboat line between Na-
poleon and Pmc Blufl', Arkansas; and a semi-
weekly line between Napoleon and Vicksburg;
besides the daily mail on the Missouri river, al-
ready referred to, viz., from Jefferson City to St.
Joseph.
The overland route from San Antonio, Texas,
to San Diego, California, has also been success-
fully commenced.
I have also made a contract for convoying mails
six times a week between Prairie du Chien and
St. Paul, in coaches or sleighs, as the ease may be,
during the suspension of navigation on the Upper
Mississippi.
REVENUE AND EXPENDITURES.
The comprehensive report of the Auditor, here-
to appendctl, will be found to contain a mass of
statistics skillfully prepared, and so judiciously
arranged as to present with clearness*and precis-
ion the financial operations of the Department,
in their various branches, during the past fiscal
year.
The expenditures of the fiscal year ending June
30, 1857, including payments fo letter carriers and
for foreign postages, amounted to $31,508,057 93,
viz:
Compensation to postmasters  $0,2S5,G09 86

$11,508,057 93
If to the expenditures of the year, as stated,
there be added' the sum of $734 16 lost by com-
promising debts under the third section of the act
of March 3, 1851, and if the sum of $1,121 93
gained by small balances carried to " suspense
account" be deducted, the net expenditures for
the year will be $11,507,670 16.
The gross revenue for the year 1857, including
receipts from letter carriers and from foreign
postages, amounted to $7,353,951 76, viz.:
Letter postage  $983,207 24
Stamps sold  5,447,764 51
Newspapers and pamphlets    634,863 51
Registered letters   35,876 87

Receipts on account of dead letters...  6,756 57
Extra compensation overcharged  1,667 30
Miscellaneous receipts  9,739 25
$7,353,951 76
But if to the gross sum above stated be addpd
the permanent annual appropriations made by the
acts of March 3, 1847, and March 3, 1851, in
compensation for services rendered to the Gov-
ernment in the transportation and delivery of
franked matter, the whole revenue of the year
will be $8,053,951 76, being $3,453,718 40 less
than the expenditures.
ESTIMATES OF RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES IN
1858.
The aggregate nun appropuated by the act of Congress ap-
proved March 3. iy.j7.lor the regular expenditures of the
year ending June 30,1858, exclusive of the transportation
of lorcign mails, of payments for foreign postages and to
letter carrier, \va^ $11,173,247
For Panama mails act ot March 3, 1857  135,000
For Charleston and Havana mail, act of March
3, J 857  50,000
For the transportation of the maiN between New
York and Havie, and New York and Bremen,
under the new contracts authorized by the
acts of Match 3, 1845, and July 2, 1836, there
will be required the sum of  230,000
For payments to letter carriers, act of March 3,
IK31, estimated  165,000
Payments' for foreign postages, estimated  300,000
Total $12,053,247
The moans applicable to defray the foregoing
expenditures cousnt of—
1st. The balance standing to the credit of the
Department on the Auditor's books on the
1st July, J 857 $1,163,886
2d. The estimated gross revenue of
1858, including loteign postages
and receipts from letter catnors... 7,795,188
3d. Balances of appropriations made
by Congress lemauung in the
Treasuty subject to requisition... 1,625,000
  10,584,074
Leaving the sum of $1,469,173
to be appropriated from the Treasury to defray
the expenditures of the year 1858, as they have
been authorized by law.
In the foregoing statement I have not embraced
the cases in which Congress has by law directed
particular services and made special appropria-
tions for them out of the Treasury, such as the
transportation of the mail by sea between San
Francisco, California,and Olympia, Washington
Territory, between New Orleans and Vera Cruz,
Mexico, and for the mail on Puget Sound,
Washington Territory, because the means are
supplied by the Treasury upon the Postmaster
General's requisitions; and if they were embraced
as matters of receipt and expenditure, the result-
ing balance to be provided for would still be the
same.
MONEY ORDERS.
The adoption of some plan for the more con-
venient and safe remittance of small sums of
money through the mails by means of orders
drawn upon one postmaster by another, having
been frequently urged upon this Department as
a matter worthy of its attention, it is deemed
proper here to state that, on the 31st January
last, my predecessor transmitted to the chairman
of the Committee on the Post Office and Post
Roads in the House of Representatives, in com-
pliance with his request, the outline of such a
plan as might be putin operation in this country.
The submission of it does not appear to have
been accompanied by any recommendation of the
Department, nor does it appear that the honor-
able committee acted upon the subject. A sys-
tem of remitting sums of money not exceeding
five pounds sterling (twenty-five dollars) in
amount was adopted by the British Post Office
Department in 1839; and«sorwe idea may be
formed of the growth and extent of its operations
from the following brief statement derived from
the annual report of her Majesty's Postmaster
General, dated March 17, 1857:
Number and amount of money orders issued in the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, every fifth yeart
commencing with 1840.

OCEAN STEAMSHIP AND FOREIGN MAIL ARRANGE-
MENTS.
The contract with the Ocean Steam Navigation
Company for monthly trips between New York
and Bremen, and New York and Havre, via
Southampton, expiring on the 1st of June last,
it became necessary to make some arrangements
for the continuance of that service, or leave the
carrying of the European mails almost exclusively
to the lines running between Boston and Liverpool
and New York and Liverpool, on which twenty-
only of the seventy-two annual voyages are per-
formed by American steamers. The Bremen and
Havre lines having, under the sanction of Con-
gross, been in operation ten years, affording direct
communication between the United States and the
continent of Europe, and it not appearing by its
action at the last session that it was the intention
of Congress that they should be discontinued on
the expiration of the contract, I deemed it my duty
to make provision for their continuance another
year. This seemed proper, in view not only of
the importance of keeping up, and, if possible,
increasing the direct communication with the
continent, in order to avoid the expense of the
English transit, but also for the reason that I had
official information of the intention of a Bremen
company to put on a line of semi-monthly steam-
ers, so as, in connection with an increased Amer-
ican line, to secure a weekly communication with
the United States. In the mean time Congress
may take action on the subject.. Under the old
contract, the annual compensation for twelve
round trips on the Bremen line was $200,000; and
on the Havre line, for the same number of trips,
§150,000. The temporary contract for the ser-
vice on the Bremen line is with Cornelius Van-
derbilt, and upon the Havre line with the New
York and Havre Steamship Company. Each con-
tract provides for thirteen round trips annually;
and the compensation to be paid is limited to the
United States postages, sea and inland, accruing
from the mails conveyed. This, it will be ob-
served, is a very considerable reduction upon the
former pay, assuming that the postages for the
year will be nearly the same as for the year ending
30th June last, when on the Bremen line they
amounted to §124,193, and on the Havre line lo
$90,042. Moreover, it appeared to be a fit occa-
sion to inaugurate a system of self-sustaining
ocean mail service; and I shall esteem it fortunate
if the present temporary arrangements lead, as I
trust they may, to the adoption of this as a per-
manent system.
A contract lias been made with the Panama
Railroad Company for the conveyance of the
mails, as frequently as may be required, between
Aspinwalland Panama, at an annual compensation
