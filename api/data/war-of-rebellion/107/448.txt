GAULEY BRIDGE, August 13, 1861.

General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Clarksburg, Va.:

Floyd's presence five miles this side of Lewisburg is confirmed. His force is variously estimated from 5,000 upward. The secessionists let out that they expect us to be attacked within a week. I am more uneasy about the liability of our line of communications along the river to be broken than from an atack in front. All the militia that can be coaxed or driven out are being mustered in Raleigh and southwestern counties, and it is certain that they talk of attacks upon our boats and baggage trains. I shall keep the Twelfth at Charleston and in guard along the river as far as practicable, but I hope an additional force may be sent for the purpose of protecting that line. Your written dispatch of 10th is received. Captain Benham had materially modified the plan of Lieutenant Wagner, as he has probably informed you. I am sorry he could not remain to give more time to the whole matter of the works. Our supply of artillery and musket ammunition should be increased considerably.

GAULEY BRIDGE, August 14, 1861.

General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Clarksburg:

Nothing more definite in regard to Floyd and Wise. Rumor puts their joint force at about 12,000. They seem to be determined to intrench themselves at Meadow Bluff, at the junction of the Wilderness road from Summersville with the Lewinsburg turnpike. We are hastening our works as much as we can, but do not really believe an attack will be made here. I have my advance guard about twenty miles ahead, with reserve and pickets connecting with camp.
