WM. B. TALIAFERRO,

Brigadier-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., May 20, 1864.

Brigadier General WILLIAM B. TALIAFERRO,

James Island, S. C.:

Thanks for the New York of the 14th. It does not accord with that we know. The enemy endeavored to cut the telegraph line this morning about 2 o'clock, between Johnson and Sumter.

Captain Mitchel opened on them with boat howitzers, and they retreated. Will you inquire from Colonel Yates why Johnson did not open on them, and if they were seen from that post?

H. W. FEILDEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., May 21, 1864.

General B. BRAGG, Richmond, Va.:

The Sixth Florida Battalion left here this morning for Richmond; strength, 425. Colonel Jones informed me that you had ordered Major S. C. Stringfellow, assistant adjutant-general to report to me.

If the order has not been given, please give it.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., May 21, 1864.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY, Mount Pleasant:

Send over the Twentieth Regiment to-night; the cars will be ready for them early to-morrow morning. Major Pringle can inform you as to the hour. If you are not too busy to-day, I would like to see you over here.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., May 22, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

General Cobb reports that the Twenty-sixth Alabama Regiment had left Andersonville for Montgomery before orders for it to go to Richmond reached him. There are less than 100 men of the Fifty-fifth Georgia Regiment at Andersonville, and says it is of vital importance that they remain there. Nothing heard of the Forty-seventh and Fifty-sixth Georgia Regiments; presume they are with General Johnston.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
