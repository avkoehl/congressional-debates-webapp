I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPHUS ROBBINS,

Major Second Battalion, Second Regiment M. S. M., Commanding Expedition.

Colonel J. B. ROGERS,

Commanding Second Missouri S. M. Cav., and Post, Cape Girardeau, Mo.

Numbers 3. Reports of Major Samuel Montgomery, Sixth Missouri Cavalry.

BLOOMFIELD, MO., November 30, 1863.

GENERAL: I arrived here at 5 a. m. The Confederates were 15 miles on the Chalk Bluff road last night. The information gained at Poplar Bluff was correct. I shall send Captain Preuitt with the First, Sixth, and Captain [A.] Johns' company of Missouri State Militia. Major Robbins is here with part of his command, and will remain unless your order otherwise.

SAML. MONTGOMERY,

Major, Commanding.

BLOOMFIELD, MO., November 30, 1863.

GENERAL: I took the Poplar Bluff road, and did not go to Ash Hills. At Poplar Bluff I captured 1 prisoner, who belongs to Reves' company, who yesterday arrived at Poplar Bluff, from Arkadelphia. From him, and from other reliable sources, I got the information that General McRae, with 500 cavalry and one regiment of infantry, was 6 miles below Pocahontas. They were there last Thursday, and the supposition was that they would march toward Bloomfield. Reves has been around, killing some more Union men, and, I think, acts as a kind of advance. It was understood by several men at Poplar Bluff that a large body was coming. The infantry is dismounted cavalry.

BLOOMFIELD, MO., December 2, 1863.

GENERAL: Captain Preuitt and command have just returned. they gave the enemy chase until they crossed the Saint Francis, where our horses could go no farther, they being literally worn out. The enemy are the most ragged and thieving rascals that ever invaded the States. Positive evidence shows that they came for nothing but plunder, in which they signally failed. Captain Preuitt met Major Robbins' command 6 miles this side of Chalk Bluff. Captain Preuitt captured 5 or 6 of the enemy, while giving them a galloping chase of 8 miles. The horses of my battalion are very much worn down, this being the eighth day out from the Knob.

SAML. MONTGOMERY,

Major.

Brigadier General C. C. FISK.
