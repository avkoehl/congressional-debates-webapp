CHAPEL HILL, March 13, 1863-11 p.m.

Lieutenant General LEONIDAS POLK,

Shelbyville, Tenn.:

GENERAL: My scouts are in, having left a point commanding a view of the enemy at Eaglevile. They report the encampment large, extending toward Rover some distance beyond the junction of the pikes, and reaching considerably north of the junction. Appearance of an extensive camp near Versailles. They returned from my outpost picket stand, on Triune road, to Eagleville. Major Johnson followed them beyond the forks of the road at Rigg's. I rather look for them to advance on this place and Rover to-morrow simultaneously.

Very respectfully,

P. D. RODDEY,

Colonel.
HEADQUARTERS WHARTON'S CAVALRY,Unionville, March 13, 1863.

Lieutenant General LEONIDAS POLK:

GENERAL: Inclosed I send you copy of captured dispatch* that will explain itself. There never was a better opportunity for giving the enemy a good whipping. If General Stewart is ordered to take position at Unionville by daylight, and a supporting force, say General Cheatham's, was ordered to start to-night, it would arrive in ample time; with my cavalry in the rear, we could accomplish much; indeed, I think it worth your presence. Of course, without infantry support, I can do nothing. I visit General Stewart to-night. I await your reply with great impatience.

Most respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

JNO. A. WHARTON,

Brigadier-General.

Lieutenant General LEONIDAS POLK,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Immediately upon my arrival here yesterday, I sent a scout in the direction of Eagleville. They returned late last night; reported no enemy at Eagleville, but the forces of Davis, Rousseau, and Sheridan encamped from the forks of the pike (3 miles beyond Eagleville) to Triune. I have read dispatches to you that announced the safety of Van Dorn. The enemy may attempt another raid on this place on their return to Murfreesborough, which I think will take place to-day or to-morrow. I send you two Northern papers.

Most respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

JNO. A. WHARTON,

Brigadier-General.

UNIONVILLE, March [13], 1863-8 p.m.
