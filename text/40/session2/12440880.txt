THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 31,
Yersatiou is out of order. House bill No. 439
is before the Senate. The Senator from New
Hampshire can move to postpone it if he sees
lit.
Mr. HOWE. If my friend from New Hamp-
shire will indulge me. 1 will explain how 1 am
circumstanced. 1 am onlv a tenant of the
floor by sufferance: L own it by permission of
my fiiend from Iowa, the chairman of the
Committee oil the District of Columbia. Of
right, 1 suppose, it belongs to him, and it is
given to me for a specific jwrpose ; and I can-
not, in justice to him and to the committee
here present, five it up without his conseut.
Mr. PATTERSON, of New Hampshire.
Will the Senator from Iowa give his consent
to let us go on with this bill until we can com-
plete it?
Mr. HARLAN. 1 would most gladly oblige
the Senator; but his bill, in my opinion, can-
not pass in a few minutes. I desire to sub-
mit au amendment to it myself, and I feel
that the bills under the charge of the Commit-
tee on the District of Columbia are quite as
important as this one. Under other circum-
stances I would be very happy to accommodate
the Senator.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is
no motion before the Senate. The Senator
from Wisconsin is entitled to the floor.

dispute about it. It is unanimously reported

important to the parlies interested that itr

take but a moment, and 1 hope my friend from

inasmuch as there is other business pending.
If there be no objection the bill may be con-
sidered.

| SUPPLEMENTARY RECONSTRUCTION BILL.
! The Senate resumed the consideration of the
I bill (II. R. No. 4:!9) additional and supplenient-
; ary, to an act entitled "An act to provide for
I the more efficient government of the rebel
States," passed March 2, 1807, and to the acts
supplementary thereto, the pending question
being on the motion of Mr. Dooi.itti.e to refer
the bill with instructions to the Committee on
the Judiciary.
Mr. HOWE. Mr. President, I do not rise
to pursue this debate under the conviction that
there is more that need to be said or done. ]
do not feel that the Republican cause or the
Republican party needs other defense than it
has already received ; nor do I feel that the foe
by which we are confronted really needs further
pursuit or furtherpunishment. When the great
chiefs of the Republican party who have pre-
ceded me in this debate have sheathed their
swords there may be found indeed dead bodies
to hack ; Falstaff found such on the plain near
Shrewsbury, I believe ; but there is not likely
to be found any living enemy to strike.
It is not my fault that I appear so late in the
field. I would have been glad to have been
here earlier, and I have been half inclined to
feel aggrieved that the reserves were kept back
so long. It will be remembered that the gage
of battle has been thrown down here by one
who is my colleague. In some sort and to
some extent he and myself are wont to repre-
sent the same constituency, and when our voices
nre heard outside of the Senate Chamber they
are more apt to be listened to by the same con-
stituency, and in some sort I have felt as though
I had a special property in him. What little
political character I have I fancy I have achieved
to a great extent by being unlike him and by
going the way he did not. On the political seas
he has been a sort of beacon light, telling mo
that where he stood there were shifting currents
and dangerous shoals; and I am not sure but
that I have acquired some credit for sagacity
in avoiding those neighborhoods. But since
my friend from Indiana, [Mr. Morton,] and
my frieiul from New Jersey, [Mr. Frelino-
hcysen,] and the other friends who have pre-
ceded me in this debate, have dropped their
plummets into every foot of the surrounding
waters, and have published an accurate chart
of his surroundings, I do not see any further
credit that I can get in that direction. Never-
theless, I think the door ought not to be shut
against me by those who have got to the feast
earlier thar 1. I am not really selfish. I shall
not begrudge iny friends a taste of the dainty
for which they evidently have so keen a relish
if they will give me a chance now, because,
really, since this gage of battle has been dropped
by my colleague, there are a large number of
people in the State he and I represent who
i would not easily forgive me if I did not offer to
I pick it up.
j And so, Mr. President, I shall proceed to
examine, perhaps at some length, the mani-
festo he has issued on this occasion ; and I
am inclined to think I shall confine my re-
marks mainly to that paper, notwithstanding
j the invitation which the honorable Senator
from Indiana [Mr. Hendricks] gave us yes-
terday to divert our attention for a lime from
my colleague to himself. There aregood rea-
sons, I think, why we should not accept the in-
vitation. In the first place, the issues they all
argue are the same. There are but two points
that any one of them dares to make against the
Republican party. The one is that we offer
suffrage to men who are not exactly white ; the
other is, that in doing this we violate either
the Constitution or, what is worse in their esti-
mation, the "Lincoln and Johnson policy."
All that the honorable Senator from Indiana
has said or can say upon these questions wo
have been in the habit of meeting and replying
to year after year for years. In the issue be-
tween ourselves and that portion of the Amer-
ican people which he represents we have already
secured verdict after verdict. Why pursue the
controversy further with him or with them?
Here is a new recruit appearing in ihe (ield,
not a private manifestly, but a generalissimo
of the allied armies. He sounds the advance ;
he opens the engagement; he leads the forces ;
and it becomes a matter of considerable inter-
est to see what this new apostle has to say of
