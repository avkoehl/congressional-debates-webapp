application of such resources to sustain the public credit as the
Government has at i s command, and vvhich would materially
contribute to that desirable result He alluded to the revenue
derived from the sales of the public lands Wa? it at all sur
prism , then, that capitalists refused to confide in the Govern
ment which refused to pledge the means i> had at its command?
Was Itatall surprising that the fo! yand impolicy of attempt
ing to boirow money unacconipaoi d by any pledge or guaran
tee for the redemption of eithei principal or interest, unaceom
panted by any genei ■> i plan < f revenue adequate to the wants of
the Goveinment, and at a time, too when, bv a combination of
Circumstances, tthe credit ol the coutjtiy was shaken to
its foundation , should Sail to succee'* The failure
of the banks an t of the States to redeem ilieit ob
ligations had pi opiated credit, and this attempt to borrow mo
n°y ui lei such circuti stances would prove to be instrumental
in the destruction of wnateyer ciedit remained, and this, taken
in connection witi the shoit sighted policy of the dominant
party to which he had all ided was enough to desaoy ti e con

it, thore wa' an lmmei se amount of money to ba saenheeei ai
íuinous lates, and capitalists were waiting to take advantage of
it lh's state of thing  was indicated by what was called a
tightness in the money-market, and the consequence of it was
that capitalists found it moie profitable to hold up their money
m erder to make purchases of property at a sacrifice, iban to
invest it in Government stocks at a rate of interest This state
of tnmgs was.the resuU of the credit system, whiehonce had so
many blind advocate* and which was now abandoning its
dupes and victims to the rum it had brought on them The
eiedit system was iheeuTspnng of the paper money system,
which was now expiring afterhavingmflictel the most incal
culahle evils on the countiy If the banks m the first instance
had been deprived of the power of issuii g then paper credus
as money, and of loming them out as such, and if the recipi
ents of their favors had been deprived of their power of lending
out again these papel «edits at higher lates of interest, then the
in 'ebtednesv of thecommunity would be ten times less than it
is If these banks had been prohibited from lending any thing
but real capital, so vastan amount of improvident loans would
not have been made to persons without resources, either from
property or the avails of their industry, and the consequence
would have been that very few of them would have become
insolvent,
Mr S then went on to show the mischievous results of the
credit system, and the evils consequent upon the circulation of
bank paper credits, instead of the constitutional money of the
country Another difiitulty was most forcibly presented and
ex sted to a fatal extent m the countiy at this time you are
requited, said he, by the Constitution, to recognise nothing as
money hut gold and silvei, and such is the Democratic doc
trine All agictd that they could not, cons itutionalfy, íecog
m=e any other kind of money than gold and silver, and ihat

might be, ltwasmth - foim of paper money, mdGovernment
could no  invest its stocks m it buch was the su>eol thing 
in tt le i«t two thirds of the c( tintry \\ hit would be the con
dition of the country, if war should take ) laeel How could it
íaise money to meet such an exigency without paying i nmnus
rates oí discount' During the last war, the Government was
compelled to take tin  kind of cuuency, and lost, in con e
q jence upwards of forty millions of dollars, as was shown by the
repoitofMr McDuffieon tne subject It was seen that the effeet
nfsuch a currency on the business of the country was to keep

in a'tateofsjspenson, but by b ing compelled to íesoii to
that bection of the countiy where specie circulated,
it etnausfd the money maiket, and made it the mte*
rests of that portion ol the country to oopose the loan

they not see the effect that this co dition of the cunency had on
the finances of the Government atthi  timei Did ihey h< t *ee

from the effects of he policy which gave up the control of the
currency to hanks and bank financiers and stillit Mi pioposed

is to oppress the people, were they not to look sole !y at Oiie ob-
ject, viz What are the wants of the Governments what shall
be the expenditure of the countrjl The majority on tills floor
told them that in the present condition ol affairs it was not only
necessary to increase this loan in amount, but in its terra of
years It was a time when the credit of Government had been
sinking smco the close of the last Administration He was not
to examine the causes of it, but that was the fact, there was a
defi it in the revenue Great Btitam and Trance were both m
the market trying to borrow monev, New York city and State
were also asking to borrow money, all with good secumy
Andatsucha tune the Goveinment of the United Stales steps
foiward and asks its Representatives to authorize Sie conlract*"
mg of a loan to carry on its affairs What was the present
«ituation of the United States? Their credit had been unpaired
by the large amount of appropriations made within the last two
years, and particularly withm the last year Under the Admi-
nistration of the country the revenue was far exceeded by tha
expenditures, and the distubution bill had come in to add its
weight to the falling credit of the country The notes of Go*
vernment were now protested, and the endorsers of them were
being sued for their amount
This was the condition of a country of seventeen millions of
people, with all their industry, activity, and capital—borne
down, in debt, and stand ng disgraced, not only foi the non pay-
ment of national, but ofState and individual ebhgations These
were the difficulties They must look them all in the face, and.
see their position Gentlemen said we had paid oifoui Revo-
lutionary debt That was true, it was done while a spirit of
economy and retienchment prevailed thioughout the country.
Dm ng the last ten years, under the opei ation ol the credit sys-
tem, a spurt of speculation had pievailed. and the States had
bein m king unpiovcmente, from which they realued no reve-
nue We now had the public oeditoi thnn 'ering aumr doora
asl m^ us to pay him onehundicd cents on the dollar for our
promises for which, mthe maiket, no man would pay more
than ninety five cents
It was a most lamentable state of things He said it with
ooi i ow What had come on he country! What curse, whm
blight was on it, that heie the pledge of the common Union, the
sovereign pledge, was  inkmgi The gentleman from Kentucky
pvlr ÜMJERwoonl had told him that he had on his table Ihe
memoian la of a contractoi of the amount of discount hehad
lost, as he had paid out Treasury notes, and that he was hereaf-
ter going to demand tlia¡.amount of loss of the Goveinment of
'he United ¡States, and he, Mr McK knewof no rule of ngH
whieh should pi event him from demai ding a hundred cents on
every dollar of the Government's promises
Mr McK leferiedtotfie Piesident's last message, m which,
it is state 1 that the evils now suuounding the Government
have not resulted fiom the present Administration, <fcc He
would ask the President's fuerds, in no spirit of unkmdnees,
whether the eh írge was Hue? What was the slate of the
Ireasury on the 4th of Manhla ii What was Hie amount of

se ion, in winch the amount was stated from the Treasuiy Dr«
parlnontatíñOOOOOá Was that chargeable on the past Ad-
ministiationl And could it fairly be made a sublet of censure
at the piesent time? In that debt were several old debts, amoni;
which he mentioned one of SI 500 Ü00 foi the Dislnctof Co
lumbn He read fiom Mr Wood'iuiy's last report lo Con-
gress relative to the then state oflhe finances, and said either
that he (Mr W ) was mistaken, or there ni ust be something un-
kind in ihe President's declaration now He said ihat no debt
ofapeiminentcharactei was coniiactedduring the pastAd-
mfnistration He a¡ o referred to Mr Van Buren's last mes-
sage, to show that he had left no debt when he went out of

He hen came hick to Mr Forward's statement of 48 000,000

the debt exceed $5 500 000 Tlat was the condition of the
