HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VA. AND EAST TENN.,Glade Spring, June 4, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel ROBERT SMITH,

Commanding Reserve Battalion, Abingdon:

Move with your command immediately to Saltville and assume command of the post. Arms will be furnished you there. So soon as you have established yourself at Saltville you may, at your discretion, grant furloughs to not exceeding one-THIRD of your command on alternate weeks, giving the preference to such men as were present at the battalion organization. Acquaint yourself with the defenses of the place and make such disposition of both artillery and infantry as will best secure its protection, bearing in mind the wells are the points to be most strongly defended.

By command of Colonel G. B. Crittenden:

Major P. ELLIS, Jr.,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I came up from Talladega to this place to-day and shall establish my headquarters here until I hear further from the major- general. On the reception of his dispatch of the 2d, directing Chalmers' DIVISION to be kept at Montevallo, I immediately forwarded an order to Colonel Neely, commanding brigade of Chalmers' DIVISION, to stop his command at Munford, where he then was en route for this place, which is five miles from Blue Mountain. But as he had been ordered by General Chalmers to bring his command to this place, and as General Chalmers had not furnished him with a copy of your order, placing me in command, he wrote me that he felt under obligations to obey the order which he has previously received from General Chalmers, to proceed to this place, which is ten miles above Munford. Armistead and Ball are at Blue Mountain. I have ordered Livingston with his part of a regiment, from 200 to 250 men, up from Montevallo to Blue Mountain. This is all of Clanton's brigade that I can as yet reach. I have information that Thomas, with about 375 men, left Montgomery for my headquarters to-day.

I am very desirous of hearing from the major-general relative to the suggestion in my last in reference to moving Chalmers' remaining brigade
