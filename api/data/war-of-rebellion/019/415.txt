Colonel J. C. KELTON, Asst. Adjt. General, Corinth, Miss.:

General Strong has saint seven companies, 600 men, well armed and equipped and well supplied with ammunition and means of transportation. General Quinby may co-operate if he can be convinced of the necessity of doing so. Cape Girardeau is probably the point to send re-enforcements, owing to recent high water.

SAINT LOUIS, June 4, 1862.

General QUINBY, Columbus, Ky.;

Colonel Daniels is operating in Dunklin County, and holds all crossings of Saint Francis River from Poplar Bluff to State line at Hornersville, where he has captured steamer D. E. Miller. He states that he is not scared, but wants a little help, and that he received his information from reliable scours. The counties of Pemiscot and New Madrid have been placed in your district by General Orders, Numbers 30, Department of the Mississippi,, 1862.

One brass howitzer left Cape Girardeau for Colonel Daniels when I was there; if I mistake not there is another at the Cape. General Strong has sent seven companies of infantry, well armed, equipped, and supplied, to re-enforce Colonel Daniels. A rebel gunboat went up White River on 2nd instant, and on its way down destroyed all cotton and sugar at or near Jacksonport.

Rebels are concentrating at Little Rock, Fort Smith, Fayetteville, Van Buren, and Yellville.
