MILITARY PRISON HOSPITAL, October 29, 1862.

[General J. T. BOYLE.]

SIR: We take the liberty of addressing you to-day to call your attention to a change in our situation, ordered yesterday by Doctor Head, medical director. Confederate surgeons, we were on our arrival here (on our way South from attending to our wounded in Perryville) arrested and sent to the prison hospital to be held (so we were informed) as hostages for a Federal surgeon said to be confined in Knoxville, Tenn. We are now to be sent to the military prison by order of Doctor Head. While we ask leave to doubt the truth of any Federal surgeon being confined merely for being a Federal surgeon, we would respectfully request of you if we are held as prisoners to be confined to some other quarters more comfortable to us as non-combatants and more suited to our condition. We will cheerfully give our parole of honor not to leave any premises or house you may confine us to, or give you bond here in the city if released on parole to return here in a specified time if the Federal surgeon should prove to be confined. We respectfully request that if we are to be held as prisoners we be assigned quarters better suited to our condition than the military prison, provided we have to leave the hospital.

Respectfully,

K. C. DIVINE,
