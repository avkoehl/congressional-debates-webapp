was a second time destroyed by the sloop-or-war Portsmouth dragging her anchors.

In May, 1865, constructed lines from Mobile, Ala., to Fort Pike, La., 130 miles, all new line, and from Baton Rouge to Clinton, La., forty-three miles, all new line, and repaired lines throughout Mississippi and Alabama, using about 150 miles of new wire upon them; also took up lines from Mobile to Spanish Fort, and from Fort Macomb, La., to Fort Gaines, Ala. Much of the line from Baton Rouge, La., to the mouth of Red River, upon the west bank of the Mississippi, was washed away by extensive crevasse. Much of the wire was saved and coiled up for future use. During the month eleven cables were laid upon the line between Fort Pike and Mobile, upward of thirteen miles in length, and most of the cable between Fort Macomb and Mobile Bay was taken up and saved.

In June, 1865, 725 of line in Texas were repaired and put in operation, mostly by their former managers, under the direction of my agents sent to Galveston, Houston, and Shreveport. The necessary material was ordered and the work commenced upon a line extending from Shreveport, La., to Vicksburg, Miss., and also upon a line extending from Houston, Tex., via Hampstead, Brenham, La., Grange, Bastrop, Austin, San Marco, New Brunfels, to San Antonio. Upon the completion of these lines, which are being pushed forward rapidly, nearly all the important sections of Texas will be in direct communication with the other States of the Union. I give a general summary of the work performed during this fiscal year, as follows:
