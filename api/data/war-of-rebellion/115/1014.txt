SECRETARY OF STATE:

General Sumner arrested Messrs. Gwin, Benham and Brent, of California, before reaching New York. He allowed them the freedom of the city on parole. The Secretary of War requests that you direct their arrest by telegraph and send them to Fort Warren.

Very respectfully, yours,

Assistant Secretary.

Mr. R. J. Walker presents his compliments to Honorable W. H. Seward, Secretary of State, and desires to see him now for a few moments before anything further is done in the cases of Messrs. Gwin, Benham and Brent, arrested by order of General Sumner and now on parole in the city of New York. As a devoted friend (now and at all times) of the Union and of the war now waged for its defense by the Government he declares it to be his profound conviction on the facts now before him that serious prejudice to this great cause would ensue from hasty action in the premises. If Me. Seward cannot see Mr. W. can conffer with him on this subject?

P. S. -Mr. W. has called and learned for the thirst time the very proper rule setting apart Saturday for foreign ministers. Mr. W. will await Mr. Seward's earliest convenience, and as no possible injury can accrue from permitting the parole to stand for the present Mr. W. hopes no further order will be made until he can confer with Mr. Seward.
