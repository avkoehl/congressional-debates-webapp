GENERAL: I have the honor to report that scouting parties sent daily in front of the cavalry picket-line fail to discover any of the enemy in the sections formerly frequented by numerous scouts and guerrillas. At Proctor's, on the Jerusalem plank road, there are pickets of the enemy's cavalry, as formerly, watching the roads leading to the Rowanty, the reserve of this picketing force being at Salem Church.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brevet Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding Second Division.
