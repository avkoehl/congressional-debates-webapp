The provost-marshal will be provided with all proper blanks. Public arms will be turned over to the officer sent from here; private arms, &amp;c., will be retained by the men among them.

Hoping that this action may result in peace, quiet, and prosperity of the border of two States that were formerly proud of each other, I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
