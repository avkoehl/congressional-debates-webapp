tors, created by the act of 1789, was not transfer-
red to the Bank of the United States They, and
they alone, weie directly accountable to ihe Go-
vernment Their duties "Here pi escribed by the
act, and «ere not, by the chaitei of the bank,
changed This feature of the bill, ¡should the
amendment of the Senator from South Carolina be
adopted, would contain no new principle, or intro-
duce any new practice Fiom 1789 to 1816, such
was the usage ot the Government, and such
was the law of the land And I would
confidently appeal to the experience of the peop'e,
whether the material change m the collection and
disbuisement of the public íevenues which took
place on the íecharter of the United States Bank
in 1816, and the subsequent changes which have
taken place, have advanced their peace, prosperity
and happiness Under the svstem which was esta-
blished in 1789, and piactised on by the Govern-
ment, the revenues weie collected and disbuised in
a currency not subject to change or deteriora-
tion, by its own fiscal agents, directly responsible
to the Government By the act of 1816, rechar-
tering the United States Bank, that corporation was
made the responsible fiscal agent of the Govern-
ment. AH the bills or notes of the corporation,
without any discrimination, were made receivable
in all payments to the United States And the act
provides further, " that the deposites of the money
of the United States, in places m which the said
bank and branches thereof may be established,
shall be made in said bank or branches," and "that
during the continuance of the act, and whenevei
required by the Secretary ol the Tieasury, the said
corporation shall give the necessarv facilities foi
transfemng the public funds from place to place,
within the United States, and for distnbuting the
same in payment of the public cieditors, without
charge," &c Thes-e previsions were introduce I
by way of amendments to the hill, atler it had been
reported by the committee, and were, I believe,
proposed by the Senator iiom Massachusetts—
thereby materially, and as it has operated, injuriously,
changing the whole practice of the Government in
relation to the collection and disbursement of the
public lunds.
Had the bank been vested with no other powers
by the act oí 1816, than was conferred by the act
of 1791, the evils which have since been expenen-
ced would have probably been avoided It was its
intimate connection with the finances of the coun-
try—it was the control it possessed over ihe public
funds—it was the political influence it was suppo-
sed to exercise—that awakened the jealousy o I the
American people, and excited feelings, and esti-
bhshed opinions, hostile to the continuance of such
an institution
A second objection made to the bill is, that it m
effect repeals the act depositing the money of the
the Government with the local banks, rnd thereby
producing great injury to those institutions I ha\e
already expressed my own views as to the effect
this measure would have upon State banks And
all I wish to add is, that, until local banks w ere
selected as public deposítales, for the first forty
years of the existence of this Government, the
local banking institutions of the country dil not
count upon anv such aid from the Government
as essential to then prosperity, or necessary to their
success
A third objection to the bill is, that it creates one
currency ioi the Government, and another lor the
people
Was there any complaint of this sort made
under the act of 1789"! Was there then one cur
rency for the Government, and another for the
people' It the amendment of the Senator of
South Carolina be a lopted, afier 1841, the revenues
will be received in gold and siher only And
what would be the effect of such a proceeding
Would the gold and silver received for the pub-
lie revenues be abstracted horn the general en
rency' Would it be locktd up from circulation'
Would it be salted down m the vaults of the Sub-
Treasury officer7 No, sn the revenues and the
public dues would come from the people, and they
would be disbursed to the people If paid m a
metallic currency to our fiscal agents, the same
currency would, by the same agents, be disbursed lj
to the public creditors The history of'the Go-
vernment shows, that at the commencement of
each fiscal year, there is not on average in the pub-
lic Treasury, subject to draft, a sum exceeding six
millions of dollars. If, in the course of the )eai,
twenty more millions have been received, a like
amount has been disbuised A sum not exceeding
six millions of specie then, would ordmauly be tne
balanceo! the account of receipts and cxpendituies
at the commencement of the aval 3 ear, and can
the abstraction of six from more than eighty millions
now in tne country, so alarm the teais of gentle-
men as to lead them to the conclusion that the con-
 equence of this measuie will be the establishment
of one cuirency for the Government, and a diffe-
rent 1 uriency lor the people' And aic not all of
the people' Are men holding office a distinct race
from the people' And can it be senously contended
that the revenues received and pud out to public
cieditois is withdrawn from circulatioi, and from
the care of the people' No, sn, it can not Debtors
and creditors to the Government are parts of the
same community They aie of the people , and
then íelation t~> the Government is constantly
changing To-diy one may be a cieditoi—to-mor-
row he may be adebtoi, and I can not conceive m
what waj or manner the adoption of this bill would
«reate one curiency for the Government, another
foi the people—would establish those high or low
in office—all who have claims upon the Govei n-
ment—-as an ordei of men possessing pecuhai and
exclusive puvileges. It can not so be The ob-
jection his no foundation in tiuth
A fotulh objection is made, that the bill divorces
the Go\ eminent from the banks The bill sepa
rates the Government fiom the banks in no illici
v ay thin it says, that no longer shall the bank*
ha\e the public deposit! s fui the pmpose of ex-
pandí'!.: and ciiliigmg fh 11 papei cunencv This
is the divorce about which fcenato s complain
The piopnety of such a separation I have alreadj
discussed
Another objection made to this measure is, that
it in eflcct destioys the credit system under which
the country has enjoyed so much prosperity
There can be no doubt that ciedit, as contradis-
tinguished from 1 ash payment, his been, and may
be, attended with consequences most beneficial to
the prospenty of a community, that it stimulates
enterprise, in-1, when properly restrained, can not
f ul to advance jmate interest, but such a ci edit
sjs!( m needs not the piotccm g ca e ol the Gi vun-
mpnt It is the excess of credit that bungs danger,
distress, and dismay It is that uncontrolled and
uncontrollable spirit of adventure which leads to
disaster, embarrassment, and rum It is that bold
and daring passion for speculation, sustained for a
time on credit, which puts in jeopardy the fortunes
of individuals, prostrates the best efforts of enter-
prise, and scatters firpbiancU and death among an
active business communis Whence this general
desolation which now j u vades our land1 Whence
this gcneial, this umveisal embariassm<mt, which
now prevails fhn ugh the country' It is to be tiaccd
to a most injudicious and unwarrantable expansion
of the credit system This has been the elicit ni
and producing cause of the pecuniary di tiess which
now extends from Mame to Florrda A judicious,
a well íegulated sy stem of credit, has its axlv antages
in every community, and among ever) class of our
citizens, but I submit whethei, from the w of ul
expenerice we hate hid, we ought to wish to return
to the local 'tanks the public deposites, if thereby
an enlargemnit ol individual credit could be
attained, and a coirespondiag increase of a paper
medium' I cannot doubt what would be the
response
Another objection to the bill is, that its tendtney
is to mciease Execut \ e pa'ronage That oojection
has been so ably answered bj the Senator fiom
Mississippi, ihat I wou'd not v eaken the force of
his aignment b\ submitting any additional conside-
rations of mv own
Another objection is urgtd, that the bill, if adopt-
ed, cpn not, with convenience, or with a proper re-
gard to the security of the public fund- , be execut
ed    My answer to that objection is, that no dif
Ificulties were experienced under the act of 1789
The punciples of this bill were then carried mto
effect with convenience to the Government and to
fhe public creditoi, and with safety to the public
tunds, and the) may again be so earned into ef-
fect
Anofhei objection is, that this is an experiment,
and that experiments with refeience to the public
finances aic not only odious, but dangerous to the
secmity of the public funds.
My answei to this is, what would the gentleman
from Massachusetts call upon us to do in the pre-
sent exigency' Try some odier plan' adopt some
other e\p°dient' Would any project which the
Senaioi m gnt íecommend be any the less an "ex-
periment'" But a further answ ei to this objection
is, that the measure now recommended by the
committee is no " untried experiment " It has been
practised upon here and clsenhcie, and has recsiv-
ed the approbatio 1 of the people
The amendment proposed by the Senator fiom
Vngima is to stnke out the bill reported by the
Com mt'ee on finance, and 10 insert a " bill desig-
nating and limiting the funds receivable for the
revenues of the United States " This amen Iment,
if adopted, will continue the local banks as the de-
positories of the public money, and will justify the
Trpasiuy Department m the leceipt of the bills of
specie paving banks, of cerlam denominations,and
at fixed peuods The Scnatoi from Virginia urges
the adoption of his amendment, first, to save the
local banks, to induce them to resume specie pay-
ments, anj also to establish and pieseive one uni-
form cuirency throughout the country, to continue
tne practice ol the Gov eminent which has existed
since the joint 1 solution of Apul, 1816, so far as
it ulates 'o the kind ot money lo be íeceivtd foi
the public revenues, that, by its adoption, not only
the banks, but tin people themselves, would obtain
a s nsible uhet fiom exi tmg tmbarrassments
The ubstiiute of the s^naloi's bill for the bill
rep >i ted by 11< com mttce « ou'd have 1 0 tendency
to sive the local bants I have already said that
those institutions which are sound and solvent need
not this kind of assistance from the Government for
their own prolectio 1, that there is an abundance of
bank capital for the business ot the country, ¡f not,
there is no want of disposition ti create or to hold
bank capital, and that so great must necessarily be
hcieafter the unceitamty as to the amount and du-
ration of these Government deposites in local
banks that to continue them, under the deposite
act of 183G, woul! serve only to embarrass those
mst t itions Nor is there much force m t íe reason
uiged for the ami ndment—that its adoption would
serve 10 establish und preserve a uniform cur-
rency throughout the country The eighty depo-
site banks selected by the Government, m the
different sections of ihe Union, ¿mount only 10
about one-tenth of all the banking institutions
now existing by virtue of btate legislation,
and comprising ibout cnr-flurd of the wnole bonk-
ing capitil of the country The selected banks,
soattticd, as thev are, ovei the whole Union, act-
ing, as they must do, under thcrr own local char-
lei', and accountable to then own Slate authorities,
with no common rnleiest, but simply peiformrng
the con litio i mitin t rms of their respective con-
tracts with the Government, independent of each
otne tin do but little '0 legulate the general cur-
rency Tne bills of specie paying banks in Lou-
rsrana, although issued by those institutions selected
as depos tones of the public revenue, cannot pass
and be pasted as a cunency rn New England
Tne character and capital ol these Slate institu-
tions clearlv evinces that then crrculat on to any
great extent can not pass curient beyond the boun-
daries of tneir ow n btates The banking system
new existw2 m New England rs well arranged for
the convenience and t íe ^county of that commu-
nity It is one of the blessed effects of that S3 stem
that the paper of our lecal banks mainly circulates
in l's own immediate , iun<} The moment the
paper of anv pir'icul 1 Lank is doubted, that mo-
meat it ce ises to fenm, Ij any considerable extent,
a pai t of the circnlatm.  medium It is coll cted at
the commucial capital il New England, and sent
home for payment The paper, therefore, of any
local bank, not current t the great mai Let of New
England, w ill no longei b« received by any por-
tions of our ccnimun ty The consequence of the
system is, that the bank paper best known and
highest appreciated by the community constitutes
