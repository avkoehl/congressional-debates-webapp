General S. COOPER:

I earnestly recommend to the War Department that General Bragg's command be extended over East Tennessee. It is of great importance.

General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Richmond, Va., May 9, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston,

Tullahoma, Tenn.:

Proceed at once to Mississippi and take chief command of the forces, giving to those in the field, as far as practicable, the encouragement and benefit of your personal direction. Arrange to take for temporary service with you, or to be followed without delay, 3,000 good troops, who will be substituted in General Bragg's army by a large number of prisoners recently returned from the Arkansas Post capture, and reorganized, now on their way to General Pemberton. Stop them at the point most convenient to join General Bragg. You will find re-enforcements from General Beauregard to General Pemberton, and more may be expected.

Acknowledge receipt.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
