General SCHOFIELD:

If you have a good cavalry brigadier I will give you Colonel Hamilton's regiment, Ninth Ohio, with a full regiment and nearly 500 horses, to make a brigade of cavalry, but I must have a real head, one that will give it personal attention.

W. T. SHERMAN,Major-General, Commanding.

SCHOFIELD'S HEADQUARTERS, August 9, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have no good cavalry commander. Colonel Adams is probably the best I have. Can you not assign one from some other department? It is very important now for me to have a good man to collect my scattered fragments and bring them into serviceable shape.

Respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

General SCHOFIELD:

I have no cavalry commander at all. All the cavalry of the Old Army of the Tennessee is backing Mississippi, and General Thomas' cavalry is not well commanded. Colonel Adams told me his time was out, and he was going back to Kentucky to reorganize. You must secure his horses and appraise them, as they belong to the men. Colonel Capron is back; how is he?

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO, Near Atlanta, Ga., August 9, 1864.

Major-General	SHERMAN:

I don't know Colonel Capron yesterday,but understand he is not of much account. Colonel Garrard is the best man I have, but he is wanting in dash. I have ordered the appraisal of Colonel Adams' horses, and will to get my cavalry in shape as soon as possible. I cannot do better for the present than to put Colonel Garrad in command, unless Colonel Hamilton is better. I know nothing of him.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

General SCHOFIELD:

I have not least objection in the world to paymasters coming to the front, only it is risky to bring too many greenbacks. I advise all that it is safe to pay the bulk in checks, and only enough greenbacks for, say one-fourth. General Thomas says deserters report Admiral
