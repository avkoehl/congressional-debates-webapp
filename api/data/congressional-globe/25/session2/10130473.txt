íes, and not the vjhite fingered gentry. He put the
despatches in the possession of the captain, and
he whesled about and put for England, where he
amused himself m high life a time, and returned,
for wh ch Mr Clay paid him nineteen hundred and
forty dollars So I think this will offset the charge
of paj mg Mr Early
So far, I think my colleague has been unfortu-
nate in his charges, inasmuch as they have the ef-
fect to call to recollection charges against the dy-
nasty he wi-Jies to reinstate, much more aggravating
and pernicious This, so far, seems to me to be a
blunder on his part, but the worst have to come
yet I think his speech will be unfortunate for his
party and his purposes Another most important
blunder has been committed by my colleague in
his "few comments on the professions and practice
of Mr Amos K>ndall, late Fourth Auditor, now
Postmaster General " He quotes from certain let-
ters of that gentleman, published soon after he
came into office, showing some of the abuses he
found in office, committed by my colleague's politi-
cal friends, and showing, also, that he had or
would reform them, and aifects to show that*he
had not done sj One of these extracts is as fol-
io  ^, \iz "The interest of the country demands
that this office shall be filled with men of business,
aid not with babbling politicians'1'' Can any man
saj ^ uh trath that this principle was not earned
out1 I assert, sir, and challenge contradiction,
that ti e Fourth Auditor's Office, while Mr. Ken-
dall was in it, was "filled with men of business,"
and not "n th babb'ing politicians " Mr Kendall
mmsclf was "a man of business," and neither he
no- his clerl s ever neglected their public duties to
babbl  pohtif s with any one When he went into
chat office, what did he find to be its condition un-
der the dynasty which my colleague is laboring to
restored Was it all purity, all honesty, all indus-
try No, sir it was all rottenness, all idleness
His predecessor was one of the favorites of the
Clay party, and Mr Kendal! soon discovered that
he had been guuty of the grossest and most direct
frauds on tbe Trepsmy, of which he was found
guilt} by an unwilling cpurt, and more unwilling
jury, after a ti emendousparty struggle to secure him
trom pumshmen* What thanks did Mr. Kendall
get from mv colleague and nis party for exposing
these frau 1«, and bunging them to merited punish-
ment1 Why, sir, he was abused through the parly
preces as a conspirator and persecutor, and while
the prosecution of the culprit was in progress, was
night after night insulted and hooted at under his
window Yes, sir, this was the mode the gentle-
man'a party undertook to prevent the exposure and
p imshment of their corruptions This was the
reward they, then, bestowed on integrity and fear-
lessness m office, and the same game has been kept
up since, down to the speech of my colleague
Now, I ask, was it no reform to remove a pecula
tor upon the Treasury' My colleague does not
seem to thirkso Why1 Is it because he be-
longed to his party1
Well, Mr Kendall filled the Fourth Auditor's
Office "with men of business," and what was the
consequence1 Much of its business was one, two,
and three years m arreáis, and in about a twelve
month, it was brought completely up Did he ob-
tain or ask any additional force1 No, sir After
the business was brought up, he suffered two
cleikshiDS to remain vacant for a long time, and
one until he left the office, because, having "men
of business" about him, he did not need the whole
fore which the law allowed. Moreover, under
the Clay ad uimstration, which my colleague would
restore, the contingent appiopropnation for the
Fourth Auditor's Office was f 1,500 a year, but
Mr Kenda'l reduced it to #1,000, and one jear
asked for no appropr.ation at all, having erough
sarplus of former appropriations on hand to meet
his wants Thus the expenditures of the office
were largely reduced by him, while its business
was greatly improved What credit do my col-
league and his friends give him for it1 They have
poured on him, from beginning to end, a torrent of
unceasing abuse On every new exposure of a
defaulter or a rogue, through his instrumentality,
their abuse has been redoubled, clearly showing
Appropriations for harbors—Mr. Duncan.
that an honest and feailess public ofHcer is their
highest antipathy.
While complaining that the party m power have
not made the promised reforms, my colleague gives
incontestible evidence of his smeerity by sneering
at those which were made. He even finds grounds
of attack upon Mr. Kendall for sending to the post
office, to be charged with postage, the letters and
pamphlets fraudulently enclosed to the Fourth Au-
ditor to evade the post office laws, and for discon-
tinuing sundry newspapers, because he could de-
rive no assistance from them "in settling the ac-
counts of the United States Navy " Yes, sir, in
the reforms actually made by Mr Kendall, as well
as m those not made, the bank attorneys, immacu-
late and consistent men' find ground of attack"
When Mr Kendall went into the Fourth Audi-,
tor's office, the legal postage on private letters re-
ceived under cover to the Fourth Auditor, was
about a dollar a day, or at the rate of f 365 a year,
and on the supposition that as great a number had
gone out under his predecessor's frank, the fraud
on the post office revenue, through that single of-
fice, under the Clay-Adams administration, was
over $700 a year1 Mr. Kendall put an entire stop
to this abuse, and what thanks does he get from
the Bank stipendiaries2 They hate and abuse him
the worsefor it. But, says my colleague, he frank-
ed seme prospectuses of the Globe ^Velf, if he
chose to send them to his friends, had he not a law-
ful right to do so1 Did he violate any law, or do so
much of it as to constitute an abuse1 That is not
pretended, nor can it be with truth But because
he put a stop to violations of the law, and then ex-
ercised his privilege in conformity with law, the
Bank attorneys find an inconsistency m it1 I can
tell my colleague, upon undoubted authority, that
Mr Kendall's course in that respect is not changed,
that he uniformly sends to the post office letters for
others enclosed to him, to be charged with postage,
and sometimes pays it himself, that he covers no
letters with his frank, not strictly his own, no, not
even those of his wife and children What praise
does he get from the Bank attorneys for this scru-
pulous obedience to the law1 The highest praise
—their unceasing abuse
My colleague finds a vast inconsistency in Mr
Kendall's discontinuing newspapers as Fomth
Auditor, because they gave him no assistance "in
settling the accounts of the United States Navy,"
and paying for a number of tbem as Postmaster
General' Is this effort to show inconsistency a
whit short of contemptible1 The papers were not
of use to him in performing his public duty as
Fourth Auditor, and therefore he did not take
them, they are of use to him m performing his duty
as Postmaster General, and therefore he does not
discontinue them Is there any inconsistency m
this? None but a Bank attorney can make it aut
While Mr Kendall was Fourth Auditor, he pa>d
all his newspaper subscriptions out of his own pocket,
because they were exclusively for his prívate use,
but, as Postmaster General, it is essential that he
should have not only the general but the local m
tslligeace from every quarter of the country, and
the only wonder is that he pays so little for it
It is natural, sir, for the Bank attorneys to find
fault with the part acted by Mr Kendall in the re-
moval of the deposites. Their client was destroy ed
by that measure, and the source of many a good
fee dried up But here, again, Mr Kendall is fol-
lowed by misrepresentation "He got ten dolíais
a day," it is said, "for doing this injury to the pub-
lic"—meaning the Bank Now, sir, I pronounce this
statement entirely without foundation Mr Kendall,
underan appovntmentfrom the Secretary of the Trea-
sury, visited the cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia,
New York and Boston, to negotiate with the banks,
and spent some days in each city He had neces-
sarily to see much company at the hotels where he
stopped, and those who have had occasion to take
prnate pallors and have private tables, at the pub-
he houses m those cities, where they necessarily
see, and treat civilly, many gentlemen calling on
them, know that the actual expense, including tra-
velling, can scarcely average less than ten dollars
a day Mr Kendall paid all these expenses out of
his owi pocket, and received from the Treasury
barely enough to make himself whole.   This la the
H. of Reps,
whole of this mighty affair, and the sum received,
all told, was #316 11 How rich this man must
have made himself'
My colleague follows Mr Kendall into the Pqst
Office Department, and makes another mistake at
the jfirst jump "The printed list of clerks m lus
Department," says he, "exhibits his father-ia-law
and two riephews, with salaries of §1,000, #1,200,
and $1,406," &c Mr. Kendall has not, and
never had, two nephews among the clerks of hjs
Department. But what if he had two nephews in
his Department? Have they not as good a right to
be there as any body else, if they are honest and
competent to the duties assigned them1 If there be
places of peculiar trust, is it wrong that the head
of a Department should fill them with men whose
integrity he best knows, although they may be his
riephews or his brother1 When abuses and frauds,
instead of the most honest and honorable discharge
of their public duties, are perpetrated by his rela-
tions, it will be time enough to censure their
appointment.
Nothing will satisfy these Bank attorneys. Ma-
jor Barry is abused for not keeping every thing
right in the Post Office Department, and Mr. Ken-
dall is abused for putting every thing right The
committees of Congress, majority and minority,
complained of Major Barry for making extras agant
allowances to ¡Stockton and Stokes, and now Mr.
Kendall is abused for not being willing to pay
them allowances a thousand times naore extrava-
gant One of my worthy colleagues [Mr. Whit-
tlesey] I believe wrote some twenty" five pages m
a book, 30,000 copies of v. hich were printed by
order of the House, to prove that Major Barry had
allowed those contractors some $100,000 more than
they were entitled to by law, and yet voted for an
act under color of which they have been allowed
$161,000 more under the same pretences, and has
<=tood quietly by and seen Mr Kendall compelled
to pay it by judcial usurpation, if not something
worse I should like to ask my honorable col-
league |Mr Whittlfsfy] a question or two Did
he not thorougnly understand this ca e, having
investigated and written a long report about it1
When the bill for the rehef of Stockton and Stokes
was before the Hruse, did he nst offer a long
string of provisos, which were adopted1 Were not
these provisos so carefully framed as nolle touch ene
of the claims m controversy, and be, mfact, perfectly
nugatory1 If so, what was the object1 If he did
not think Stockton and Stokes entitled to as much
as they got from Major Barry by $ 100 000, why-
did he vote for a bill to give them more1 And
when he found that an enormous sum more was
awarded them, why did he not propose to repeal
the act, instead of standing by and seeing Mr.
Kendall compelled to pay it1
This case will illustrate the sincerity and honesty
of the Bank attornejs For polucal effect, they
abused Major Barry for making allowances, then
voted for a bill authorizing allowances much more
extravagant, and because Mr Kendall refused to
pay still further allowances, which he did not be-
lieve authorized even by that act, they abuse him
for withholding from Stockton and Stokes their just
dues' All this shows that they care not a fig what
use is made of the public money, and that their only
ooject in finding fault is, to impair the confidence
of the people m the Administration They see
$161,000 wasted on Stockton and Stokes with in-
difference, if not with joy, and complain that $315
was allowed Mr Kendall, to pay his expenses when
upon public service
Sir, I have taken some pains to ascertain on what
principles the Post Office Department is administe-
red by this much-abused man I understand that
he went into it with a declaration tha* he should
try the experiment of administering it in strict con-
formity to moral princ pies, and the laws of the
land, ind, if convinced of its imprac icabil ty, would
hold it no longer It was the fasfcuen for officers
and clerks m the Department to receive presents
i rom contractors and, when travelling, to ride free
n their coache-.. Believing that, to say the least ©f
it, these practices tended to corruption, he forbade
the reception of all or any such favors from con-
tractors under penalty of dismission, and prescribed
the same rules for himself.   AU presents from con-
