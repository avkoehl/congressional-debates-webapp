Cross-Roads, Opposite Station 11, GA., November 28, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

I have the honor to report the Fifteenth Corps, of my command, with the exception of one brigade of General Crose's division (which is at Wrightsville, having gotten off the road and mistaken that place for Johnson), at or near this point. General Wood's division is at the intersection of the roads shown on the map as Johnson, while the other divisions are camped along the road on which they marched. The brigade of General Corse's division at Wrightsville will be brought up, and the corps will move toward Numbers 9 to-morrow. The roads traveled by the Fifteenth Corps to-day were tolerably good, with a few bad places. Information is received from prisoners taken to-day to the effect that Early's corps has been, or is to be, moved to Millen, and that corps, with Wheeler's cavalry and the militia, will give us a fight at that point.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
