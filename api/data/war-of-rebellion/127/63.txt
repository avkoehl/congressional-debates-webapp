said arms as samples, he said, of what he could furnish. The arms were received and examined and proved to be old guns fixed up. Such an act being a violation of the letter and spirit of the contract, none of the arms were taken as a part of the contract, though the sixty were taken as an experiment. The affair is now being adjusted between a U. S. Senator and said Whitney, but owing to the bad faith of Whitney the arms will probably never be received and the companies will have to resort to whatever can be furnished. The number of commissions issued to officers of volunteer companies approximates 255; of this number 65 were issued to captains and 190 to lieutenants. Several companies were organized and commissions were issued nearly in the spring, but owing to causes but partially reported they disbanded within a few months after their organization-among them Sharon Rifles, of Madison County; University Rifle Company, La Fayette; Chickasaw Dragoons, Chickasaw; Home Guards, Lowndes, and a few others. The commissions to the officers are not included in the aggregate of commissions. The number of men regularly organized into uniformed companies of volunteers amounts to 2,027 armed. Of the 38 companies unarmed, allowing 50 men for an average of each, we have 1,900 unarmed volunteers, which number added to the number of armed men gives an aggregate of 3,927 men belonging to the volunteer companies, which approximation will vary but little from the correct number. This force armed and properly officered would on the field be formidable to an advancing foe. The number of arms in the hands of the troops amounts to 2,127 stand; of rifles, 1,256; of percussion muskets, 391; of flint, about 60; of pistols, 462; of sabers, 360, and will be classified in the schedule marked A* in the appendix.

The State quota of arms from the United States Government for the year 1860, amounting to 315 muskets or their equivalent in other arms, was drawn in field artillery, amounting in all to six-6-pounder bronze guns and two 12-pounder howitzers, all of which were dismounted save on 6-pounder with carriage, limber, and implements and equipments complete, and one set of harness for four horses. These guns have all been mounted at the State penitentiary and are ready for the field, with the exception of harness, caissons, battery wagons, and forge. There is not a caisson, battery wagon, or forge in the State (at least no record of such in the office), and a field battery is incomplete and but partially effectual without them. The harness is being made, and the caissons, &amp;c., can be made at about the same expense as a gun carriage. Fortunately for the State the quota for 1861, amounting to 319 muskets, was advanced by the Secretary of War in May, 1860, and was taken in U. S. long-range rifles with Maynard primer and saber bayonets, and amounted to 212. In consequence of the 6-pounder gun carriages, the Secretary of War advanced the requisite irons on account of the quota for 1861, which irons amounted to 34 muskets or $422, thereby reducing the number of rifles.

The Legislature at the session of 1859 and 1860 passed an act entitled "An act further to regulate the militia and volunteer systems. " One section of said act established a volunteer military board, to be composed of the captains of volunteer companies of all arms throughout the State. In compliance with the provisions of said act the Board
