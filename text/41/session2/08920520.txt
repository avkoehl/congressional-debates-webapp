Whereas tho right of free spcech in a legislative
assembly includes and comprehends an equality and
full participation in the known and legitimate means
of addressing such a body, without distinction of
subject or persons on the part of all its members,
and which inheres in the constituent through the
representative; andwhereasthsexistingrulesofthis
House, either from their intrinsic inefficiency or be-
cause they are misunderstood or are not strictly
enforced, do not furnish to all members' an equal
facility in obtaining the floor for the discussion of
the great questions of public policy and the rights of
the people presented for the deliberation arid action
of the House; and whereas, also, while it is emi-
nently just and proper that the members of a com-
mittee, upon reporting a bill to the House, should
havo a reasonable precedent-right to debate such a
bill, as being more thoroughly informed upon its
subject-matter and its facts, there is no fitness or
justice in any special arrangement, private or other-
wise, by which particular members outside of such
committee shall be entitled to the floorin preference
to and in exclusion of any or all "other members:
Therefore,
Be it resolved. That the Committee on Bulcs be,
and t.hey are hereby, instructed to inquire into the
propriety and expediency of so amending the stand-
ing rules of the House or of reporting such addi-
tional ones as will sccure to all the members the
equal means of addressing the House.
