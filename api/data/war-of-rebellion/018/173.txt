Brigadier-General SCHENCK, Franklin:

Dispatch Numbers 2 received. If you can fall back in safety, do so until you reach us. If not, hold the place, improving its natural defenses by abatis, barricades, and the like. Every exertion will be made to arrive in time with our entire force.

(Received 7 p. m.)

Colonel TRACY:

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Brigadier-General.
