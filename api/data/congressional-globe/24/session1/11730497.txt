Cin it be doubted, sn, that in the collection
and distribution of moneys in this manner, the
purpose of the Constitution, in attempting to
equalize and fix the ratio of the public burdens,
is palpably vnlated and defeated'
The State of Delaware, having only one Repre-
«enta'rve, has contributed one two hundred and
fortv-second part of the thirty millions, equal to
§123,967, but as her Senators are taken into the
latio of distribution, she is to have deposited with
her by this bill three two hundred and ninety-
fourth parts, equal to $306,123, and she will re-
ceive $183,156 more than she has contributed to
this fund     On the other hand, Virginia, having
contributed twenty-one two hundred and forty
second  parts, equal to $2,603,307, will receive
twenty-three tw o hundred and ninety fourth parts,
equal  to $2,346,943, making a loss  to hpr of
$256,364.    The loss of Pennsylvania, upon the
same basis, will be §409,846, that of New York,
$662,953     The eight large States which lose by
this ratio have one hundred and thirty-nine mem-
bers upon this floor, while the eighteen smaller
States, which gain, have but one hundred and
three members     Thus the small States, having
the power in the Senate, overcome the large States
m this House having superior numbers     Now,
Mr Chairman, what are the restrictions of the
Constitution, which declare thatallduties, taxes,
and excises shall be of equal worth, if, after
raising money upon this basis, Congress may
return (deposit) to one or more of the States twice
as much as she pays >    And what would be the
use of adopting the federal numbers as the basis
of direct taxation, if Congress,after raising money
in that ratio, may return it to the States in a ratio
arbitrarily adopted by themselves, and altogether
different     It is palpable that by this process the
provisions of the Constitution, which were de-
signed to make taxation equal on all the people
of all the States, are, so far as this bill goes, ren-
dered nugatory and of no effect.    But, sir, the
unconstitutionality of the object which this bill
is intended to effect is aggravated by its injus-
tice.
I have shown that in the distribution (deposit)
of $30,000,000, the State of Delaware will receive
$182,156 more than she has paid, and Virginia
will receive $256,364 ltss The consequence is,
that Virginia is taxed $256,364, not to support her
own government, nor to support the Federal Gov-
ernmi nt, but to support the government of Dela-
ware and the other small States For the same
purpose, sir, New York will be taxed $662,956,
and Pennsylvania $409,846, and Ohio $212,512.
Not only is this result most unjust in itself, but
it is in palpable violation of the whole scope of
No. 32
the Constitution, so far as it relates to the collec-
tion and disbursement of the public moneys, and
it can uadily be perceived, that by the operation
of &uch a >-clieme, the people of the small States
may in ctTt ct be rthev ed from taxation altogether,
not only for the support of this Government, but
for tht suppoit of their own governments In
pioportion to the increase of the tanfF, and other
taxes It \led by Congiess on the people of the
United States, would their burdens be diminished
bj a. i etui n to them of a greater surplus, until the
amount rt turntd would be greater than the whole
amount by them paid, and the larger States would
in fact bt taxtd to support their governments,
make their roads and canals, and sustain all their
s> «terns of improvt ment and education. Import
ant advantagts were secured to the small States
by the Constitution, but this is not one of them.
The large Statts agreed by the compact to con-
tribute their jiibt proportion for the support of the
Geneial Government, but they did not agree to
be taxed to suppoit the governments of the snlall
Statts, and all the expensive systems of improve- '
mentor education which they might think proper
to adopt To compel them to do so by any
species of ltgislation, is to impose upon them
buidens which they did not agree to bear, and
is, in my opinion at least, in direct violation of
the spirit, if not of the letter, of the Federal
compact. How any Senator or member of this
House from the laige States can reconcile his
vote for this bill with his own sense of justice to
his State or constituents, to his own conscience
undei high and solemn obligations to support
the Constitution, I am utterly at a loss to per-
ceive.
It is said, I know, in justification of this ratio,
that the population of the new States has in-
creased since the census by which the last ap-
portionment was made, and that as to them it
does no more than justice I admit that the
eight new Stales may be entitled to an increased
share, in consideration of their increased popu-
lation, equal to ten or twelve per cent.; but I do
I not perceive the propriety of giving to the ten
original small States such immense advantages
as I have shown they will obtain, merely for
the purpose of giving to those new States an
increase I will, sir, at the proper time, pro-
pose an amendment to the bill to make a dis-
crimination of ten per cent, in favor of the new
States, because I believe that justice to them
requires it
I know, Mr. Chairman, that gentlemen try to
persuade themselves that this is a deposit with
the States, and is, therefore, more safe than in
the deposit banks If I could be brought to be-
lieve this in good and honest faith—if I could
be made to believe that it was even intended ever
to restore the money to the Treasury, I should
entertain less apprehension, though I would not
then vote for the bill, because I would never con-
sent to create the permanent relation of debtor
and creditor, or of bailor and bailee, between the
States and the General Government
How and when, sir, is this money tq be re-
stored to our Treasury > Is it expected that
Congress will compel the State  to levy a direct
tax upon their people to repay iti Those who
will candidly say they believe that the States
will do so, must disregard all the known princi-
ples of human action. Congress will have a
more ready means to replenish their coffers by a
new American system—by a new tariff of duties
upon imports; and I wish honorable members
from the South who go for this bill to remember
that I now tell them plainly that they will there-
by bring upon themselves all the evils, imaginary
or otherwise, of which they have lately com-
plained so loudly.
They will have no just ground of resistance,
and must surrender to the supreme lawof neces-
sity, which they will now establish. Let them
not complain hereafter of such burdens, and I
beg them not to admonish me any further of their
strict construction and State-rights doctrines, nor
of their hair splitting distinctions upon constitu-
tional law Where, sir, are all our great defend-
ers of the Constitution   Have they disappeared
fiom these Halls, under the influence of gold?

HARBOR BILL.
SPEECH OF HON. W. McCOMAS,
OF VIRGINIA,
In the House of Representatives,
June 24, 1836,
In Committee of the Whole, the harbor bill being under
consideration.
Mr Peytov had moved to amend the bill by inserting
an additional section for continuing the improvements of
Cumberland river below the mouth of Laurel, which is
hereby declared a port of entry, $d0,000
Mr McComas offered the following amendments to the
amendment of the •gentleman from Tennessee
For macadamizing the turnpike road leading from Cov-
ington, Virginia, to the mouth of Big bandy, Kentucky;
and for establishing a port of entrj at the falls of the Great
Kan iwha
Mi. McCOMAS addressed the committee as
follows
Mr Chairman: It appears to me that we have
fallen on strange times It has been but a few
days since we passed a bill regulating the public
deposits in ct rtain local banks, and of depositing
the surplus revenue, over and above five millions,
with the several States, agreeably to the number
of then Representatives and Senators in Con-
fress. It was thought that a measure that passed
oth branches of Congress with such unanimity
would have given quiet to the distracted councils
of the nation, at least for the present session, but
to my great astonishment, these sanguine expect-
ations have not been realized. The bill now
underconsideration seeks to appropriate upwards
of a million dollars to the improvement of the
harbors and riveis in the United States, and
principally all new works, as I am informed.
The artful manner of connecting the various
interests of the country together in this bill can-
not fail to strike the most superficial observer
Does any gentleman on this floor believe there
are five of these points that could receive the
votes of a majority of this House, for the sums
proposed in this bill, if the question was taken
upon their merits separately' This, sir, is the
proper test No appropriation of the people's
money should be made, unless a majority of the
Feople's Representatives shall think it right. Sir,
have no notion of swallowing this gilded pill
by unitjng the good and the bad together ; I want
to vote on each proposition separately. This
course of legislation has been truly denominated
log-rolling—a system corrupt and demoralizing
in its tendency, and if persevered in will, in my
judgment, upturn the principles of this Govern-
ment.
Sir, I had flattered myself that each State would
have been permitted to make its own improve-
ments, that the late division of the surplus reve-
nue was to effect that object by carrying out the
views of the President on that subject. But, sir,
if this mode of legislation prevail, it is vain to talk
of a division of the surplus revenue, as there will
be none to divide. Upwards of twenty millions
have already been appropriated, and your table
yet groans under the weight of bills containing
multiplied millions more. Sir,there is one single
bill on your table that will and must pass, con-
taining six or seven millions for Indian treaties.
This bill, sir, has its origin at a timethat ren-
ders its passage questionable. Sir, it is one of
that litter of bills that was prepared at a time when
it was thought wise legislation to appropriate the
whole surplus revenue to some object, in prefer-
ence of giving it back to the people. To do this,
it was necessary to increase the objects of appro-
priation, and multiply bills on the subject, as it
would not do to present this enormous sum on
the Atlantic sea-coast in one bill, lest the appalling
sight mightshockthe nerves of the House. Hence
we" find a harbor bill, a light-house bill, and a for-
tification bill, all seeking to spend millions of
money in the same region of country, and at the
same points; and in addition to this, we find our-
selves placed in the ridiculous attitude of having
a conflict of jurisdiction between the Committee
of Internal Improvement and the Committee on
Commerce, both claiming to exercise jurisdiction
over the same objects; each presenting to this
House bills appropriating money for the same
