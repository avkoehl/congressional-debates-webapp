THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

United States bonds, although more of them
may be daily transferred there than of almost
any other stock. Let it have its reward in the
future dividends it may collect upon its con-
federate stock! The masses will believe and
trust us. and they should not be disappointed.
We arc now passing through the ordeal which
our aristocratic adversaries charge as being
the fatal stumbling-block ofall popular Govern-
ments, or a crisis for the maintenance of pub-
lic credit in a popular assembly of the people.
The adaption of any course which for the
present seems grievous such adversaries pro-
claim to be an impossibility, however wise and
profitable its future results may promise. This
will prove to be a stupendous slander I have
no doubt. The best way to lessen permanently
our taxation is to press on steadily, not rashly,
to a resumption of cash payments, or to the
point of making legal tenders equivalent to
gold and silver. Until then hardly any legisla-
tive proposition can be mooted that a majority
will not consider worth within thirty or forty per
cent, of par, and as that is equal to the value
of our currency it stands a good chance of
being carried. But when our appropriations
are reckoned equal to hard cash they will not
be squandered. Besides this, the whole ex-
penses of the country—its purchases for the
Army and Navy—would be at once reduced to
something like ancient limits. Let us here
challenge public confidence by taking the first
step toward specie resumption, and then, if
the work is done kindly and courageously at
the Treasury Department, as every induce-
ment would urge, resumption will follow with-
out inflicting injury upon any class of the com-
munity.
There is another question which deserves
consideration. What would be the effect of a
general war in Europe? It is true that the
lioman question and the Eastern question may
at any moment provoke a war of continental
proportions, and France and Prussia have old
sores, uot readily healed, liable to arouse na-
tional wrath upon the slightest touch. But it
should be remembered that these causes have
been tested. The danger here has been immi-
nent for a year past, and far more imminent
than at present. Greatpreparationshave been
made with a prospect of immediate war, and
and yet United States securities abroad all
appeared to be in safe harbors and maintained
a firm anchorage. None were sent home, and
why should they be? With the exception of
Prussia all these European nations are already
so deeply involved in debt that any further
increase presses hardly upon their credit. War
would compel a lavish use of their credit, and
such use would weaken the value of their own
securities and at the same time give relative
strength to those of the United States. It is
difficult to see how our credit should be made
to suffer from the misfortunes of others, and
it is far more likely to profit thereby.
Any alarm on the point about our bonds
being thrown back upon us being thus quieted,
as it deserves to be, it would appear that there
is nothing in our condition or that of foreign
nations which could by any probable chance
turn foreign exchanges against the United States
for some time to come. This would be our
greatest danger, and I thing we may feel that
we are fully insured against all peril from that
direction. There is one item of strength of
peculiar and marked distinction which deserves
not to be overlooked, which is that we may
fairly estimate an annual addition to our popu-
lation from foreign sources of 250,000 persons
—the number last year was 323,767—and these
are estimated to bring into the country not less
upon the average than eighty dollars per capita
in hard mqney, amounting to the sum of
$20,000,000*
It remains now to consider what will be our
resources at home on July 4,1869, to meet the
demands which will press upon us if this bill
should be adopted.
From the most reliable estimates we have,
including that of the Mint, there was in the coun-
try not lesa than $275,000,000 of coin in 1860.
Now, if we can ascertain what has been pro-
duced since that time and what has been ex-
ported over and above the imports, we may
very accurately reach the amount in the coun-
try at the present time.
I will take the estimate which Mr. J. Ross
Browne has furnished to me as the most reli- j
able of any within my reach, and agreeing very i
nearly with that in the President's message, J
although I am strongly inclined to think it an
under-estimate, as it is very little more than
was known to have been produced ten years
earlier. Mr. Brown estimates the aggregate
amount produced from 1800 to 1867, inclusive,
at $500,6-13,853.
The amount brought into the country by im-
migrants during the same period of time is too
large to be omitted. I am indebted to the
Bureau of Statistics for the following state-
ment;
Immigrant  arriving into the United State*.
1861  112,705
180 2  114.475
180 3  199.811

1865   248,603
186 6  323,767
1807 (including nine months of 1867)  231,759
1,452,655
Almost one million and a half persons thus
added in this brief and troublous time to our
population! In numbers this vastly more than
supplies our losses during the late war. Those
coming from the German nations and from the
Canadas bring with them all their little prop-
erties and all their hard money, and those
coming from Ireland are considerably better
than formerly, so that this class now really
add something to the wealth of the country
besides their bone and muscle. I do not think
it any exaggeration to estimate the sum brought
into the country by immigrants during the last
seven years at $100,000,000. Eighty dollars
per head is the usual estimate, but I prefer to
throw off some odd millions and thus to pro-
voke no challenge to any of my figures. This
will make for the sum total from all sources
$875,000,000.
From this must be deducted first the balance
of exports of gold and silver.

In consequence of a large importation of
goods in the early part of the present season,
when importers based their calculations upon
very heavy crops both of wheat and of cotton,
then generally anticipated, there is to be added
an unusually large amount of specie exported
in July and August, although the drain subsided
in August.

July $1,197,893

An allowance should be made for what has
been used in the arts and manufactures, or, in
round numbers, say the sum of $50,000,000;
and this—considering we import 60 large a
share of our most valuable jewelry—is, per-
haps, a liberal allowance. Then it is to be
considered how much gold and silver escaped
from the South of which we have no account-
Much was hoarded there throughout the rebel-
lion, and much was brought in for cotton sold
to the blockade runners; yet it is probable,
while the South never had capital bo as to be
able to keep on hand at any tim« a l^£$t sur-
plus of coin, that there was less gold and sil-
ver brought into the rebel States from abroad
than what was sent out, even if we except the
last remittance received by us through Mr.
Davis. Through contraband trade the South
unquestionably obtained a good deal of gold,
as well as other supplies, from the North, not
counterbalanced by the "contrabands'' going
North; and it will be proper to allow for a
balance which may have been exported from
the South over and above its receipts of not
less than $25,000,000. Then it is reasonable
to allow liberally for such amounts as may
have been carried out of the country by trav-
elers in their personal baggage over and above
what has been received in a similar manner,
and not accounted for in the table of exports.
If this should be set down at $20,000,000 it
would most likely cover the amount. At pres-
ent travelers going from preponderate over
those coming to our country; but every year
the difference may be expected to decrease,
and when the Pacific railroad is finished the
preponderance is likely to be changed forever.
The New World will not soon cloy its visitors.
The last deduction to be made is for silver and
other coin carried into the British Provinces
to make purchases, of which it is possible
incomplete accounts are kept. Over what has
in a similar way been brought into the United
States, this may be estimated at $10,000,000.
This will make the account stated as follows:
Amount of pold and silver on hand 18C1....$275,000,000

This shows, as I think, beyond all successful
controversy, with liberal allowance for possible
inaccuracies, that there is in round numbers
not less than $400,000,000 of specie in the
country now waiting to be called forth from
its- inglorious retreats to its former fields of
honor and usefulness. The measure proposed
will liberate this large amount of circulating
medium, locking up at the same time only an
inconsiderable amount of legal tenders, and
money will not be less abundant in one month
after paper shall have been elevated to the
rank of cash than it was before. To the spe-
cie must be added $300,000,000 of national
bank currency, making $700,000,000, and to
this must be added over $300,000,000 of Uni-
ted States notes, making in all a currency in
some form of $1,000,000,0001 Surely there
need not be any apprehension that we shall
not have currency enough to discharge all the
functions that money can discharge, or oon-
duct all the business of the United States,
though bounded on the south by hurricanes and
earthquakes around St. Thomas, and on the
north by the glaciers of Alaska and the icebergs
of the north pole.
From the time of Amsterdam banking to
this day one dollar in specie has been reckoned
enough in all countries upon which to base a
circulation of three dollars in bank paper, and
in the United States a much less sum has
always sufficed for any banks in fair credit.
The United States notes may amount to about
three hundred and fifty millions, but of that
one hundred millions are now held by national
banks, and when for all purposes made equal
to coin the banks would still retain not less
than seventy-five per cent., and possibly more,
of all they now hold. These banks will have
added to their stock of coin three semi-annual
receipts of interest on their bonds and cannot
need more, except in rare cases, for the prompt
