this army require but two pontoon trains to accompany it on its march, and that while here it will be a useless expenditure of the public means to have all the trains provided with teams with nothing to do. The quartermasters now provide with them. Meanwhile all the trains will be kept in perfect order, and if the requisite number of men are not now on duty with them to secure this end, the brigade commander must make additional detail from his command for this service. If the requisition for supplies have not been filled, the fact should be reported. This is the first complaint that has been referred to the commanding general, and is so general and in definite that he can give it no action. He will; see that all necessary are furnished promptly, and will also require that the train a serviceable condition and ready for use at a moment's notice.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Lieutenant-Commander MAGAW, Potomac Flotilla:

The major-general commanding directs me to request that you will send two your gunboats into the Rappahannock River, to come up as far as Port Royal, and father, if possible. He has reason to believe that the batteries located on the river below Port Royal have been withdrawn. It is desired that you demonstration shall hold the enemy in that vicinity, and keep them from retiring. If the batteries are there, the purposes for which you go would be favored by exchanging a few shots with them. It is hoped that this movement will be made as speedily as possible. He also desires that you should communicate to Commander McCrea his request that he will have a portion of his fleet ready to convoy a fleet of supplies to the Pamunkey River.

Very respectfully, &c.,

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
