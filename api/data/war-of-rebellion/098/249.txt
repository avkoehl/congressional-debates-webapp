HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Near Nahunta Station, N. C., April 10, 1865.

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that, in compliance with the written orders of Major-General Logan, I left my camp near Goldsborough at 5 o'clock this morning, moving on the direct road leading toward Pikeville, a station on the Weldon railroad. When I had arrived within some three miles of this place I took and road leading to the right and almost immediately crossing Nahunta Creek. I here found a few of the rebel cavalry, but they did not impede my advance to any material extent. Continuing on this road for the distance of some three miles I struck the road leading toward Beulah and Folk's Bridge on Little River. Rebel cavalry now showed themselves in my front with some boldness, and appearances began to indicate that I was approaching their reserve. I learned that General Ridde's [?] division was encamped on the cross-roads on which I am now located, and so pushed forward as rapidly as possible in order to engage him at this place, but my skirmishers met with quite determined resistance, especially at the cross-roads, so that when I gained the ground I found nothing but the burning camp-fires they had hastily abandoned. I judge from the appearance of the enemy's camp at this place that he must have been about 1,500 strong. I went into camp at 5 p. m; am covering the roads toward Beulah and Wilson's, as well as the one on which I have been marching and the one leading toward Pikeville. My headquarters are near the cross-roads. I have received no casualty reports from my command to-day.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. R. WOODS,

Brevet Major-General.

HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Carter's Plantation, N. C., April 11, 1865.

COLONEL: I left my camp in the neighborhood of Nahunta at 6 o'clock this morning, moving out on the road toward Beulah. My advance skirmished with the enemy's cavalry during the entire morning; my progress, however, was but little impeded. At the crossing of Great Swamp, about six miles this side of where I camped last night, they endeavored to make a stand in order to burn the bridge over the stream, and they would have succeeded had it to been for Colonel Gage's command; his men, after driving the rebels off, soon cleared the bridge of the burning rails that in a few minutes more would have completely destroyed the bridge. Moving on past Beulah, where they again showed some stubbornness in giving the road, I reached Folk's Bridge at 11 o'clock. I found here that the enemy, some 1,500 strong, had taken a road leading up the river on the east side; they, however, had torn up the bridge, so that it was 4 p.m. before I could commence crossing. I moved forward some two miles this (west) side of Little River at 5 o'clock, encamping my division at the forks of the Smithfield and Pineville roads, covering both roads, and also the road on which I have been marching. My headquarters are near the forks of the roads. No casualties are reported to me for to-day.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. R. WOODS,

Brevet Major-General.

Lieutenant Colonel MAX WOODHULL, A. A. G., Fifteenth Army Corps.
