haps one month, m which to pour out his vituperation of the
South and its institutions by making an issue which had nothing
todo with the question before the House He had marked,
Mr M said, the various changes which the gentleman's de
fence had undergone in the course of the last six days The
other day the gentleman entertained the House with a biogra
Phical history of himself for forty years, with anecdotes of Cau-
lmcourtandthe Emperor Alexander, and with 1th of Tuly ora
Uons that he had delivered All this was more for the Abolition
ists of the North than for his defence to the House Emboldened
since by the apparent sympathies of the House, he abandoned
the ground that he took the other day of a strong attachment
for the Union, and now was attempting to show that there ex
medin the institutions of one section of the country grounds
10 ;K^y a f>roPosltlon t0 overturn the Government Now,
said Mr M after the gentleman had consumed so much of the
"me of the House in the manner he had done, were the
Northern members prepared, during the cxistenceof the21st
rule, to give him further time to enable him to connect the
question of abolition with the tremendous question of a disso-
lution of the Union i Aftei a few further lemarks from Mr M
S%Mr ARNOLD observed that he had opposed, from the first,
the introduction of this mattei into the House, and he had on
every occasion that offered, voted to lay it on the table, be
lieving that no good could result from the pioceedings He
should vote now against the postponement asked for by the
gentleman from Massachusetts, inasmuch as it would then
leave the question open ou the motion of the gentleman from
Viigima [Mr Summers] to refer the subject toa select com
mittee, and should «hat motion prevail, the gentleman would
have all the time he desired He should, for his part, prefer
the reference of this matter toa select committee, as moved by
the gentleman from Virginia, [Mi Summers] believing that
course to be the best, and because u offered a mode by which
gentlemen mignt escape from the situation in which they weie
placed After votin* to allow the gentleman to call for testi
mony, the House could not, he thought, m decency refuse him
an oppoitunity of u«ing it Mr A then moved the previous
question on Mr Adams's motion
Mr CUSHING inquired ofthe Speaker whether the previous
question, if ordered, would not bring the House direnly toa
vote on the resolutions?
The SPEAKER said yes on the amendment to the amend
ment first, then on the amendment, and then on the onginalie
solution
Mr GUSHING    And it cuts offthe motion to postpone?
TheSPEAKER said n did
Mr CUSHING     And it cuts off the motion to commit
The fePEAKER No, the question of coram tment to a select
comrmtt^eis a part of the amendment, and if the previous
question is ordered, the House will be biought to a direct
vote on the proposition of the gentleman from Virginia, [Mr
f3uMMi,Kb ]
[Which proposition is, to submit the whole matter to the in
quiry of a select committee ]
After a momentary conversation between Mr  Thompson, of
Mississippi, and the Speaker, as  to the ordei in which the
questions would be put-
Mr  GWIN (and Mr   PICKENS simultaneously) moved
that there be a call oí the House
Mr SMITH, of Vngirna, a«ked th* yeas and nayt, on that
motion, which were oidered, and, bei¡ e taken, were \eaa,
82, nays 98
So the call was íefused
The question then rerun ing on the demand of Mi Arnold
for the previous question—                          N
Mr ADAMS requested the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr
Arnold] to withdiaw that motion, and if it was not the plea
sure of the House fo postpone the fuither consideration of
the subject, he (Mi A ) was ready now iO pioceed with his de
fence
The SPEAKER (addressing Mr Ar\or.r>) inquned if he
Withdrew the motion for the previous question
Mr ARNOLD said that, if the gentleman horn Mas<*achu
set's withdiew his motomto postpone, ho (Mr A ) could not, of
course, insist on the motion fir the i íeMoun question
Mi ADAMS withdrew themt (ion to po-tpone
Mr THOMAS V MAR Mi U L it ne ved the motion of Mr
Arnold for the pieviou*, qut-st on
But the SPEAKER intimated that the rrotion could not mar
be made, because the gentleman tiom Massachusetts (Mi
Adams) hcl \ the floor in coot nuation oi his defence
Mr ADAMS then ptoceedQd with hi^iemaiks and continual
his complaints of misiepie&entatioi and ¡ er&rcut oi, and of
the institution o' via vet y líe wis read ng copiously from an
Abolition pamphlet for the purpo e oí showing how infer oi the
State of Virginia was to ISev\ \ ork in population, wealtn, add
resources, because of the exbtuice oí tlaveiy m ihc lorinet,
when
Mr Adams was called to orderly
Mi SAUNDERS, who submitted to the Spider that the
question being on committing the lesolution of t,cii«uie on M
Adams to a seleit comiiutee with certain mstruc ions the
reading of es^ay  or new papu artic'esm opposition to, or in
support of the light of slav iy,oi of tne conduct of the Auo i
tiorrUs, was> not peitiueitt tj the quustion, and that Mi
Adams m reading and commenting upon such mattei, wa^ out

The SPEAKER said that the ptopo-ition to commit to a
select committee wis offered as an entnc subs itine foi the
resolution and amen tment, and that thus, the whole n en s. oí
the sub¡ecf mattei to which thty ha1 ícfeience wet c laid open

w ith the South a question of expediency and safety—thev never
could separate the   two lace     thev were  there, and thdt

events     it    must    be    defended     Circumstmces   at   the
Noith liad a'ready   leudeied  the  intercourse between that
section of the country and the South unsafe; and this he ut-
tered with profound regret There was not simply a body of
agitatiors m several oí the States, but they had, from soma
cause or other, been able to wield the power ofthe Legislatures
to the injury of the South Whatstep, then, must or could be
taken^ Why, the adoption of a measure similar to that adopted
by Virginia, who had always taken the lead in great measures,
ind had ever been distinguished for judgment and patriotism
She had a system of police which prevented her property from
being taken away by vessels coming from New York, and the
Constitution expressly declared that "no person held to service
or labor m one State under the laws thereof, escaping into
another State, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation
therein, be dischaiged from such service or labor, but shall be
delivered up on claim of the party to whom such ser-
vice or labor may be due" Just m proportion as the
grievance complained of should increase, would the South
be compelled to move m a body, and, by mail and
by commercial regulations, resist the injustice, until
the intercourse between the North and the South might ahso
lutely cease He asked the North, and he appealed to gen
tlemen, and called upon them to say, mine name ot the coun
try and as lovers of the Union, whether misstate of things was
desned, or nof* and whether the ¡South must be compelled to
exercise the high prrv ilege under the Constitution, and resort to
police power to protect its interests? On reason why the South
forboie was that, if the worst should come to the worst, she
would have this gieat protective power, but gentlemen from
the North had the power, m a great degree, to avert this tre-
mendous result Let them look here, and at the other end of
the Capitol, and al*o view the appeal make by alarge conven
tion held m the State of New Yoik, at which resolutions were
adopted, calling upon the slaves m the South to escape from
their masters, and offering protection to them No man who
knew the condition of the slaves, could believe that it could be
bettered He declined entering into a comparison of the condi-
tion ofthe slaves and the white laborersof our own country,
but he would remark that no laborersoutof ourcounliy were
in abetter condition, and enjoyed a greater share of their labor,
for their own benefit, than did the slaves of the South
