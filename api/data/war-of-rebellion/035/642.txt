hundred stand, which, being badly damaged, cannot be ready for service for a month. I will also state that, since the battle of Murfreesborough, I have repaired, put in order, and issued back to the army five thousand and eight stand of arms.

Very respectfully,

W. D. HUMPHREYS,

Lieutenant and Ordnance Officer of Post.

CHATTANOOGA, February 20, 1863.

Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

General Bragg's energetic action has increased his army so rapidly that there are no more arms for issue. He expects to require 10,000 within a month. Can they be furnished as wanted?

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

Respectfully referred to the Secretary of War.

The arms can only be supplied by securing those we now have at Bermuda. I urgently recommend that all available means shall be taken to get them transported, and especially that the steamer Giraffe should be sent there to bring them.*
