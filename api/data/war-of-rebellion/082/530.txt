mine. They can report at your headquarters, where Captain Mallam, volunteer aide-de-camp, will soon be to take charge of them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS THIRTY-FOURTH NEW YORK BATTERY,July 27, 1864.

Captain R. A. HUTCHINS,

Asst. Adjt. General, Third Division, Ninth Army Corps:

SIR: I have the honor of reporting no changes in position that I am aware of. About 12 o'clock some troops in enemy's line (I should judge about two companies) to our left appeared to be leaving their works. About 4.30 o'clock, in the same place, clouds of dust appeared as if troops or wagons were on the move, but so distant could not clearly distinguish.

I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

JACOB ROEMER,

Captain, Commanding Thirty-fourth New York Battery.
