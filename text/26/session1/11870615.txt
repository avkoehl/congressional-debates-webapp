Independent Treasury—Mr. Cooper.
H. of Reps.
one millions, and ought to hare made you easy;
and so yon appeared to be then: for the deposites
were greater than at any other time. But in .'836,
the deposites had been transferred. This bank, and
all the banks, expanded, and it appeared there was
no end to prosperity. Specie was coming in by
millions. And it ought to have been permanent;
but no—it was as transient as the deposites; and,
with oar laps fall, we were in one year compelled
to snspend. This was, however, very much be-
cause the banks would have it so, and the United
States Bank conld not help itself.
A fifth proposition is, that the number of banks,
and amount of banking capitel, do not contribute
to the relief of the country.
If so, from 1837 to 1840 ought to have been a
time of great relief; during those years 240 were ad-
ded to a number of banks, and 60,000,000 to the
aggregate banking capital. Bat we know we have
experienced no relief.
A sixth proposition is that a substitution of
stocks, as a basis, in lien of deposites, and their ne-
gotiation abroad, produced an importation of spe-
cie beyond the actual products of labor, which
was a loan to be paid back after a season, with
interest.
Look at the United States Bank table, and yon
find on the commencement of the stock operations
after the removal of deposites—specie came in for
three years till it went up to over $18,000,000.
Look, too, at the State banks. From 1830 to
1837 the specie was increased from $22,000,000
to §37,000,000; and still they suspended. What is
stranger still, during a suspension, the specie is in-
creased from 37 to 47,000,000 dollars, and no re-
sumption, notwithstanding the circulation is re-
duced to what it was in 1834.
Now, sir, with from a third to double the specie
they had in 1834, and a circulation reduced to be-
low what it then was, by near $10,000,000, why
cannot they resume?
Sii, I will tell you. If it was not for those
nameless matters, called by the bank "other liabili-
ties," there would be a resumption in ten days.
Those "o.her Labilities" have resulted from the
improper and illegitimate use of banking privi-
leges.
The gentleman from Philadelphia [Mr. Ser-
geant,] asks you in triumph, "wherefore this vast
importation of useless specie1?" Let him put the
inquiry to the banks—they can tell him.
In return, I ask him wherefore is that specie not
paid out and our public credit redeemed? 1 answer
it for him. The banks are but the agents between
the foreign creditors and the domestic debtors.
They profit both by the non-payment and the pres-
sure. Therefore they press that payment may not
be made. For in that event they lose their occu-
pation. Some of the banks, I admit, do not act on
this rale.
By what has been said, a seventh proposition be-
comes manifest.   It is this:
Nothing but the multiplication of the products
of labor, and a retrenchment in expenditures, can
relieve the pressure we feel.
I remember some weeks age, when an attempt
was made to get up this bill, an honorable gentle-
man [Mr. Wise] lrom Virginia, in great emphasis
demanded to know "what had been done to relieve
the country of its pressing difficulties." I then
felt, and still feel, surprise, that one so distinguished
should seriously think it is in your power, with or
without money in your Treasury, to relieve those
who are in debt. I was then struck and greatly
delighted with the superior candor of the honora-
ble gentleman [General Crabb] of Alabama, of the
same party with the other gentleman. He, in his
lofty tone.on the same occasion,succeeded the other,
and said "he longed to quit this place and return to
his plantation, lor he was assured that the only re-
lief was to be found by close application to the in-
terests there."
Sir, he was right, and I shall long remember
him for the independence with which he spoke
truth.
The question then arises, Can this Government
relieve the pressure of the country?
If it can, there is but one way—and that is the
last way to relief which the gentleman from Vir-
ginia er I would elect; and still it is the only way,
and is the way in which the advocates of the Bank,
if in power, could and will effect it. That will be
by an increase of revenue beyond the wants of the
Government, to be used by a United States Bank
as a basis of issue, that may be loaned and dis-
counted when they choose.
Without this result a United States Bank is a
useless thing, and would not be sought. This, too,
would be but a cry of "peace, peace," where there
was no peace.
This mode of relief, I say, is not in the power of
this Government, for the reasons assigned by my
colleague, and by Mr. Gilmer.
It would be unjust, because it would rob the ma-
ny to pay the debts of the few. The debtors would
be the relieved party. The relief would be paid
for by those who would not receive the bsnefit. It
would, in fact, be a general contribution for spe-
cial distribution—a general distribution of bur-
dens, to purchase partial and limited benefits.
To limit revenue, is the interest of the people
who pay the taxes. It limits taxation. To en-
large the receipts and expenditures, is the interest
of the Bank and its advocates; for by as muchas
you add to them, by so much you add to the ave-
rage deposites.
Whatever system therefore will produce the re-
verse effect, is the one for a free people. The one
on your table is that measure, if you retain the
specie clause; since the average sum remaining in
the Treasury, be it large or small, must be in spe-
cie; which, in the absence of Government money,
must become the basis of issue by the banks. It
then will become the interest of all banks to unite
with the friends of a simple economical Govern-
ment, to reduce and keep down the revenue to its
actual wants.
I here offer another proposition, to wit:
If you do not adopt this bill, you must use the
banks. The more avenues to expenditure, the
greater the expense. In this proportion will be the
appropriations and the revenue, whether needful
to the people or not. The banks being used, the
more expense the better, and if you must borrow
money to pay, it is still better for them and worse
for the people.
This proposition, in all its bearings and applica-
tions, has so repeatedly been illustrated, and so
fully established, by others who have discussed
this subject, and may be so easily elaborated by
any one who has attended to er examined the facts
I have referred to, that I will not detain the com-
mi'tee.
From its truth is adduced this additional proposi-
tion, which is nearly equivaletot in nature and
magnitude: That under the bank system, you can-
not long escape from the funding system, or hesi-
tate to assume those Stale debts, which have been
induced by the illegitimate use of the public depo-
sites. This arises, in my mind, from a conviction
of the truth, that another bank, limited and re-
stricted as it may be, with power to issue paper as
money, will at once become identified with the Go-
vernment, control its operations, and ultimately
dictate to the people their laws and constitutions,
and decide the amount and ratio of taxation; for,
in the language of the gentleman from New York,
"the control of the currency is the control of the
country."
This measure, with its Ifgitimate operation, re-
taining it specie clause, (which would be belter to
operate all at once,) will avert these moral and po-
litical evils, and do more to perpetuate our Union,
than any one since the enactment of the Consti-
tution.
It is desirable to Republicans and State Rights
men, because it tends to preserve their rule of
strict construction and limited delegated powers.
The opposite system pulls it down in a day.
It limits the direct and indirect patronage of the
President. With it the measure of the patronage
is "strict construction;" limited revenue; certain
and ascertained officers; without the use of the
money.
Without it, the measure of patronage is "latitude
of construing powers;" unlimited and surplus reve-
nue; multiplicity of officials, known and unknown,
with their ten thousand connections and ramifica-
tions and relationships, natural and artificial, poli-
tical and commercial, with liberty to use not only
the deposites, but three and four times their sum,
by and through the moral and political irresponsi-
bility of a lawless, uncontrollable and controlling
corporation.
To illustrate, you have but to turn your attention
to another table I have prepared, exhibiting the ac-
tion of the Government on a certain class of ap-
propriations, from the chartering of the late Bank
to the present ^e. I refer to that class entitled in-
ternal improvements. It has been prepared at the
expense of much labor; and although its perfect ac-
curacy is not vouched for, I can assert its accuracy
to every material purpose. The subjects of these
are the Cumberland road, roads and canals, forti-
fications, surveys, harbors, light-houses, break-
waters, and navy yards. It wi.l be sufficient to
give you the annual aggregate in round numbers.

From 1816 to 1827,1 have given you an annual
average: from 1827 to 1839, the annual sum is gi-
ven. Now, if you will witness the truth of what I
said, and test the influence of the Hamiltonian sys-
tem on this class of expenditures, and the subjec-
tion of the latter to the will or power of the former,
look at the years from 1827 to 1839, and see how,
with the increase of ihe deposites, these appropria-
tions increased—how, as the Bank expanded, these
swelled—how, as the deposites were removed or
consumed, and the Bank rendered powerless, these
were brought down by the will of the people. Sir,
in spite of himself, the Bank interest and policy
controlled Jackson and his party until the deposites
were removed. Then, and not till then, do you
find any success in the principles of the Democra-
tic party on these subjects. This occurred in the
second and third year of the present Administra-
tion.
The people of the South, and Georgia in particu-
lar, will do well to consider what interest they have
in restraining this tendency in the Government.
Here are $52,000,000 expended on these objects in
little more than twenty years. What portion of it
do they pay? At least half. What portion is spent
with them? Not one-fifth. What portion is spent
amongst those I represent?   Not one-tenth.
Mr. Chairman, I do not regret that which is
spent rightfully and properly for i,the good of the
Union, though it be in the North. No, sir. It is
the adoption of an unauthorized rule, that lets in
all kinds of expense—through channels innumera-
ble, that grieves me—channels made broad and
deep by the bank policy, which my associates are
contributing to promote by opposing this bill. Take
another class of expenses of particular individual
and local interest, to wit—pensions. Here is a
statement, showing the whole number of pensioners
under the several laws, and the number in, the
Southern and Northern States:

The amount paid to pensioners is about in the
