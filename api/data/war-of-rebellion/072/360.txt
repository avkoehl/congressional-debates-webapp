Report of Major Frederick A. Atwater, Forty-second Illinois Infantry.
HDQRS. FORTY-SECOND ILLINOIS VET. VOL. INFTY.,Near Atlanta, Ga., August 12, 1864.

SIR: In regard to the operations of the Forty-second Illinois Infantry, I beg leave to report as follows:

The regiment, under command of Lieutenant Colonel E. D. Swain, rejoined the brigade on the 6th of May last, after marching from Nashville, Tenn., on its return from veteran furlough, and reported for duty to General C. G. Harker, then commanding the brigade. On the following morning we resumed our march and entered upon a very eventful campaign, known as "The Georgia Campaign of 1864." When we rejoined the brigade we number 20 commissioned officers and 238 enlisted men. On the 8th of May we skirmished a part of the day and participated in the capture of Rocky Race Ridge, and went on picket in the evening, and were not relieved in time the next day to take part in the bloody and unsuccessful assault upon the enemy's fort on Buzzard Roost or Rocky Face, where our brigade lost so many of its brave officers and men. On the 13th we marched to the front with the balance of the brigade, the enemy having left our front during the past night. We found him again strongly posted near Resaca, where we engaged him in the afternoon of the 14th, relieving the Third Kentucky Regiment and holding our ground for one hour, when we were relieved to replenish our ammunition. Our loss in this short engagement was 3 officers severely wounded, 2 of them mortally, and 7 enlisted man killed and 24 wounded. On the 16th we were the second regiment to cross the Oostenaula River, and again placed upon the skirmish line, which resulted in a loss of 2 enlisted men killed and 1 wounded.
