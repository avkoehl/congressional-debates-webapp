I shall be able, I think, to provide fuel for all these steamers by to-morrow morning, by working all night, and think, also, I can hereafter provide fuel for steamers as fast as they arrive, until the army corps is removed.

Inclosed I send you a list* of steamers assigned to Second Division. I expect they will want another boat or two before they get loaded, as that is usually the case.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. L. FORT,

Captain and Assistant Quartermaster.

P. S.-I learn that the dispatch-boat Diana, sent up with Colonel Wilson, exploded her boiler at the mouth of White River. No lives lost.

FORT.
