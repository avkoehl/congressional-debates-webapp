being held as reserve. In the attack the First U. S. Cavalry distinguished itself in a splendid charge against double its number of the enemy, repelling his column back in confusion. Lieutenant Hoyer, of the First, a gallant and promising young officer, fell mortally wounded while leading his squadron in the charge. The enemy were finally driven across the Opequoin to Bunker Hill, and the division encamped near Smithfield. The next day the brigade was ordered on reconnaissance to Bunker Hill, to discover if possible the whereabouts of the enemy's infantry. Two divisions of his force (infantry) were met on their way to attack us. The brigade was withdrawn to the right bank of the Opequon, and the entire division, after a stubborn resistance, fell back toward Charlestown, about two miles. The enemy did not advance far, but in his turn retired to the left bank of the Opequon. August 30, marched to Berryville, and on the 31st and 1st of September remained in camp.

September 2, marched to Bullskin Run at daybreak, and at 7 p. m. marched again to Berryville. September 3, marched, via White Post, to Front Royal and Winchester pike, and on the 4th returned to Berryville, where the right of the enemy's infantry line was found to rest. This was avoided with but little skirmishing by a movement to our right. On the 5th of September the division moved to the right of the infantry then facing the enemy, and picketed, reconnoitered, &amp;c., until the night of the 18th. At 2 a. m. on the 19th it marched to the Opequon and took part in the battle fought on that creek, a report of which is given separately.* September 20, led the pursuit of the enemy to Strasburg, found him in force on Fisher's Hill. September 21, marched to Front Royal by way of Buckton Ford, and thence, on the 22nd, with the Third Division, up Luray Valley to Milford, where the enemy was found strongly posted. The division was but slightly engaged. Captain Emmons, assistant adjutant-general of the Reserve Brigade, was dangerously wounded during the day be one of the enemy's sharpshooters. It having been decided impracticable to carry the position of the enemy without great loss of life, it was decided to withdraw both divisions. This was done at dark, and the command on the following day returned to Front Royal. Near this town the advance of the Reserve Brigade encountered a body of guerrillas, under a Captain Chapman, who were in the act of capturing an ambulance train of our wounded. The gang was quickly dispersed, with a loss of eighteen killed. Lieutenant McMaster, of the Second U. S. Cavalry, was mortally wounded in this affair, being shot after he was taken prisoner and robbed. The night of the same day the command marched to Milford, and after crossing Overall's Run (where the rebels had destroyed the bridge) by a ford, bivouacked until daylight on the 24th. The march was then resumed, when Wickham's cavalry was met near Luary and routed by the First and Reserve Brigades, with the loss of nearly 100 prisoners and one battle-flag belonging to the Sixth Virginia Cavalry. September 25, crossed the mountains to New Market, where, after halting, feeding, &c., the division moved on to Harrisonburg. September 26,m the Reserve Brigade was detached and marched with the Third Division to Sutanton, Wayunesborough, &c.; the remaining portion of the division moved on to Port Republic, the Second Brigade in the advance, driving the enemy's cavalry before it across Middle River into Brown's Gap, where the enemy's army was found in force.
