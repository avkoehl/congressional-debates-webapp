HEADQUARTERS,Moccasin Creek, March 24, 1865-6. 15 p. m.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Commanding:

GENERAL: I struck a portion of the Twenty-fifth (colored) Corps this morning south of the creek. They attacked me, but we repulsed them and then drove them two miles to their works close to Cox's Bridge. They appear to be guarding their pontoons. Prisoners say that the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Corps are in Goldsborough, the Twentieth entering to-day, and the Fifteenth in rear. I suppose this latter went down on the other side of the river. They expect to recruit here for two weeks. If the troops at Cox's Bridge remain there to-morrow you could strike them to great advantage, and could partially destroy their pontoons. There is no late news from Wheeler.

I am, very respectfully, yours,

WADE HAMPTON,

Lieutenant-General.

TEN MILES FROM GOLDSBOROUGH,

Little River, March 24, 1865-8. 15 a. m.

Major-General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: I crossed (swam) the river at this point yesterday; found some Yankees four miles from here. During the evening were killed 7, and now send you 13 prisoners from Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Twenty-third Corps; also 4 from the Twelfth New York Cavalry (the only cavalry with Schofield). Prisoners report that Sherman had a review yesterday and told his troops that they could now rest a few days. We were yesterday over as far as the Weldon railroad; found nothing except a few foragers over there. I will report if I discover anything of importance to-day.

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. M. SHANNON,

Captain, Commanding Special Scouts.
