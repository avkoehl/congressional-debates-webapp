Fiscal Bank~~Mr Rives.
Senate.
e/en that bill, becpuse it contained a provision
for discounts Yet there 'is room left to mfrr, that
there is another species of Bank which he would
approve—a mere Fiscal Agent vf the Governme t
Mr. Clay would not say that ihe country ought
not to have such a Bank, if nothia  els^, can he ob
tainsd He understood that some of hi  friends
were preparing a measure which they think will
meet the approbation ot the Pr° ident A'l that he
could say vas, he would tcow no obstacles in the
way, ii he co ild not co-operate with them He
thought that a Bank limited to exchange might ef-
fect a great deal of good, and t wa«- worthy of
trial
Mr RIVES observed  that this morning it was
his most anxious des re to be spared the necessity
ot saying a single word en Ihe suhjept wh ch no v
occupied  the deliberandi", oí ¡he Senate—an i ne
should  most  unqu stionab y  b&\e píese"-' rd that

it his duty to make m relation t) he cond "t   t the
President of the Umttd S ates in discharge of the
h gh official duty itr-p" ed or biru by the Cotisti'u
non.    He h d hoped  that the Senator irora Ken-
tucky would, aftfr what h  had «ad in the prehr-i-
nary part oF his  remarks,  have confined  h in elf
strictly to the Tien s of th   question     Tae S naior
said that this que tion was, simply whether th s   ill,
which had been returned by the Pre ident With his
objections, was such a measute as could be pas ed
by a majority of fwo  hirds, in order to make it the
law of the laid,  in spile of toe objections of the
Ptesident of the United Slates     This was the iso
'a'ed issue to be tried in the Senate lhat morning
Now he nad «mcciely hoped that we S?natcr from
Kentucky wok'd have eonnned him elf to t1 p issue
he had announced    Fhe had done so, ho (Mi  R)

But what had been th' course of ihe S nat r from
Kentucky?   He tips made an open anu vio eit at-
tack on the President of (he United States,  vucli,

Now, said Mr R wi 1 pny 2 n lemán en t ■ 
to tell me that th1 c rcums'ancs now ex mg c >n-

Has thert been any recognition f r the hst Iwen'v

Government, of the constitutional * of tr>e B^k of
t^e United States? Has it been acqui sp d in b^
both the lot al and national authorities'! Was pub
1 c opmon in i s *"ivor arduas tueieno ptiS)"Ct
of a change ot that opinion Wo, sir, the very
revise all this is the fact Instead of f>ere being a
general acqnescence m its favcr, we find at
least one-halt oí the nation if not more,
i
arrayed against it Instead of an acqui-
escence on the part of the local authorities, we
find tbe ca=e absolutely the reverse, and we
no c nly find a powerful and determined party op-
posed to it row, but instead of there being no pros-
pect of a change of opinion against it, there is
evtry rea on to believe that the feeling against it
is increasing He would call the Senator's atten-
tion to the number of public meetings and memori-
als on the subject, threatening repeal, should the
measure be pa sed. These were the circumstances
under which Mr Tyler found himself, and in ad-
di ion to lhat, he had never changed his opinions
on the subject, as there was reason to be'ieve that
Mr Madison had done Mr R here treated with
scorn the idea that Mr Jefferson eve - favored a
B niíoftlip Un ted 3 ales because he sanctioned
ihp e lai 1 shmpnt ot a branch bank in New Or-
leans then a Territory of the United States,
ard said that the anecdote which ihe Senator from
Kentucky had quo ed was contradicted by the
while courso of Mr Jefferson'  life We have,
said he, too much evidence of Mr Jefferson's opi-
nions, both oral and written, to suppose that he
xwuk'h ve s ood by and suffered himself to be
m de an accessarj to a violation of the Constnu
lion My faith, said Mr R cannot be given to it.
Afier refuting Mr Clay's assumption lhat the
s gn ng the act to establish a branch at New
Or cans, find the act lo punish counterfeiters, was
evid-nce thai Mr Jefferson «as in favor of a Bank
of 1^° Umt"d Suies, Mr R went on to say that if

ever ¡J r i us eximple of the 'athcrs of the Repub-
1 can school, h  ne\er .vo Jd have signed the Bank
