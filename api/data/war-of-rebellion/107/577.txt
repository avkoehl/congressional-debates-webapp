HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, Camp Winfield Scott, April 17, 1862-2.10 p. M.

Brigadier General E. D. KEYES,Commanding Fourth Corps:

I do not think the enemy will be so accommodating as to leave their intrenchments and attack us. I would be gald were they to do so. I the think the new works you allude to are purely defensive and based on the supposition that the facilities you allude to may be used by us to attack them. I understand the cross-roads to, which Casey's two brigades have been sent to be that near Smith's last camp and close behind his present position; if so, I am content, although I think that if there is any danger it is near Smith's position.

G. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
