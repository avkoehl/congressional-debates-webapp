HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Thursday, January 24, 1850.
The Journal of yesterday was read and approved.
THE FRANKING PRIVILEGE.
Mr. ASHAJUN asked the unanimous consent
of the House to introduce a bill, of winch previous
notice had been given.
The tide of the bill was read for information, as
follows: "A bill to rcduce the rates of postage
and to abolish the franking privilege.''
Mr. BROWN, of Indiana, suggested that by
unanimous consent one hour should be set apart
for the introduction of bills of which previous no-
tice had been given, and which would not give rise
to debate.
Mr. INGE objected. And he gave notice that he
would object to all propositions not falling within
the regular order of business. And he called for
that order.
The SPEAKER stated that the first business in
order would be the call of the committees for re-
ports.
OREGON.
Mr. THURSTON said he hoped the gentleman
from Alabama [Mr. Inge] would withdraw his
objection, to enable him, by the unanimous consent
of the House, to introduce sundry resolutions. It
might not be understood generally by the House,
that when he (Mr. T.) lelt Oregon Territory for
the seat of government, he bore a memorial from
the Legislative Assembly to the Congress of the
United States; but that memorial was lost with
his baggage on the Isthmus of Panama; conse-
quently, when the States and Temtories were
called for petitions and memorials, he had no me-
morial from his Temtory to picsent. Pie had
therefore drawn up sundry. resolutions upon the
subjects embraced in that memorial, which he now-
wished to offer and have referred to their appro-
priate committees, in order that, while the House
might be engaged in other matteis, he (Mr. T.)
might attend to his matters before the committees.
He had waited hete now nearly two months,
without an opportunity being olieied to present his
resolutions, and his Territory liad not been reached
in the call lor resolutions.
The resolutions which he now wished to offer
pertained to his Temtoi y alone, were of interest to
him moie immediately than to any other member
of the House, and were such as to call fotth no
debate, and would detain the House bur a few min-
utes. Therefore, if there were no objection, he
would offer his resolutions in their order.
The resolutions were read for information, as
ollows:
Resolved, That the Committee on the Judiciary be in-
structed to mquiieâ€”
ls-t. Whether, under the thiid aiticle of the treaty of
boundary and limits, concluded June 15, 1846, between tiie

muneration to be-ascertained?

in said article, are entitled to any more land than they had
under enclosure, or in a state of actual cultivation, at the

be introduced by general consent.
Mr. INGE did not withdraw his objection.

Mr. PRESTON KING objected, and remarked
that such bills should come from a committee.
Mr. BAYLY moved that the House resolve it-

the Union.
Mr. ASHMUN said he hoped the gentleman
from Virginia [Mr. Bayly] would not press that
motion, until an opportunity had been afforded to
members to introduce bills of which previous no-
tice had been given. No opportunity had been
given during the present session. He hoped that
the States would be called in their order.
The SPEAKER said, the gentleman was awftre
that the motion could only be entertained by unan-
imous consent.
Objection was made.
Mr. THOMPSON, of Mississippi, desired to
