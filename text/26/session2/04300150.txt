In i'u House of Rep? esciptattves,   Janum y 25!%  an 1

Treasury note bill/
Mr DOMGáN Jlddre¡>«ed the committee as fol-
lows:         \     /
Rír Chairman "Whether the present measuie is
viewed with reiercnce to its expediency or itt. con-
stitutionality, it would seem fruitle-s to spend mueh
tim- in i's discussion That it is con titutioial,
■we have the highest authority, we have the Cons i
tution before us, and we «ee that it contains no pro
hibition—neither does the mearme effect any of
the reserve! ri hts to the S ates, or to the people—
neither docs it sub/ rt or threiten any principle of
liberty, or the overtnrow nf any free inMiintu n
As >o all tl ese, it is peificily hirmless, so (hat its
ar'op'ion v. ill violate no principle which it is our
duty to main'im. It will be harmless Such has
been the practice of provid ng means tor ihe Go
vernme i liom its beginning G nerat Washm<y-
lon igned ?nd approved a bill to authorize ihe is-
sue ot 1 reasury notes Soother Administntions,
as well as this, have exercised the power of
issuing Treasury n< tes It is a pe licy which
ha* tvei been exerei ed as a function of the
Government But tonstitutional objection  are
in bad lime and tasie from th  Federal
pariy ot this House, who have ever claimed the
ii^ht to draw Ihe Con tmilicn over any mea-
sure which they might th nk "necessary and paper "
a party who can, and do, make ihe Con"iitu on
mean on thing at one lime, and another thing at
an other time, just a-, party purpo ei and pe^tini-
ary advantages may be jeeured or advanced Sir,
no Federal crocodile whining, here or elsewhere,
against the constitutionality of this measure, is
pomg to lend me into a general ct nstitotional dc
fence of it There is no sincerity in the objection
with those who m ike it But next, is this measure
expedient? Iaiswei, it is exp di< nt if it is iie-
ce ary ll Or Government uams meui,iheie
are 1 ut tuownysoi supplying that want We
must either authorize the Secretary toi sue Trei-
ury notes lo ihe amount of the means wanlid oi

as on fury thing els', political, pecuniary, and
financial the two parties are dividid The De po-
erattc paity are in favot o[ using the ere lit of the
Government m the plan of Treasurj nite to the
amount of what may he necessary lo supply the
deflu in ihe revtnuc, that is, we think the & >-

he could avail himself rt tho means to di cnarge

ment at th s time.
The Secretary of ihe Treasury informs us—and
the Committee of Ways and Means sustain him—
that there wete will be a dtficit in the receipt  of
Ihi Government for the first quarter, owing to ihe
inequality ol the collection of revenue, as well as
in the ntqualily of Hit expenditures, and the < bjeet
of tins bill is lo supply that deficit, a^- well -n lo

It is seen by this report, and the estimate* as cal
culaied, that there will b" a balance m the Tiea-
sury at Ihe end of the year, of ^824,273, and but
f< r the present deficit in tin Treasury, no i ue i f
Treisury noics would be m cesser) Co ikl lh"
expenditures of the «hole year hi equally divided
to each quarter, he anticipated receipt of ihe year
would he ample, but it frequently happens that ihe
heaviest expenditures fall upon qnirtcr-. of the
yesr when the receipts of r vtnu are the 1 ghlest,
Hence the ncce ny of providing means against
contingencies
It will bs seen by ihe appl cition of the Natchc?
EanV, to have su pended by action of Congress
the collection of a claim which the Government
his upon th U institution, lhat the Treasury will hi
minus in the present quarter Ihe amount of that
claim, li m the T easurtr's report The chi n is,
I brlieve, sl80,000. Ii toe e< lleetion of this < him
should be pos'roned, it will add to Ihe rret sily
ef Ihe l'siie of Trcasiny notes Then we «re that
means must be rai-ed The eeni'itton or the
Tieasmy i(,quir" it The honor, justice, and
obligations ol the Government demand it How,
again I a«k, is the means to be raised? We, Ihe
Demoeiacy, say, by ihe i«snc of Treasury notes,
which is a sifí and convenient m/Mhol It is
speedy It is done at once, wuhout tronhh an 1
without cost or expense The Federalists are ( p-
posed to this way Thty are for making a loan
And «here can i e imnow the mope;'—from the

farther in degradation ind vi^ili^e to the money-
ed ansioenry of th" Lon 'on Fxcliinge bv r akins

meet the wants of the Government The Tiemi-
ry «ants the money now It is no i mear are
wanted, wanted for the pensioners, wanted foi the
armv, and wantel for the cifil officers of your
Government, here and clsewhe.e But a national
debt is a daring object with tt e Federal party
They have long since adopted the Engh-h maxim,
that "a national d^bt is a national blessing " And
if that debt could be commenced undera Democra-
tic Administration, ihey would enjoy all the bene-
fits that would accrue to Federal Aristocracy
without the political odium of having con-
tracted it But, sir, I think we will leave the
exccise of thit policy to th  coming Adminis-
tration It shall have both the party benefits
at d the responsibility And now, sir, having brief-
ly shown that piesent means are wanted to enable
the Government to fulfil its> engagements for the
p-esent quarter, ind having exnre-sed my opinion
in favor of ihe ís^ue of Treasury notes for that
puipose, in preference to cb'aimii  a loan, and
thereby ommencng the establishment of a na-
tional debt, which I consider a national curse, I
might conclude my speech, but for pertain
charges and asserttops wh ch have bepn made in
th  course of thisdeoate by g ntleiren oí the Oppo-
sition, which I feel bo ind to íespond lo in part. I
will present those charges and assertions, and re-
spond to them as I present them
Thp Secretary of (he Treasury informs us, by his
report, that the Government h?s promptly met
every demand which has been ptesented upon the
Treasury during the last year The genileman
from N"w York [Mr Barnard] says that is not
the fact He tells us that the Uovermnent is largely
indebted, and that the Treasury Department has
been postponing, thTcugh. various other Depart-
ments, the just claims and demands settled
and ami ori/ed by law to be paid, and that
even th- alnulted clai n> and wages of ihe
Hbcrers upon oui public bull lings, works, and
forlificilions, have been po tponed until the fir-jt of
April next Wow, s r, I deny all of thi«, and pro-
nounce every nerd of / i'"stiiute ol foundation,
and I assert, lhat the Government has met every
chim wh ch it was bound to pay, or hid the right
to tay The gentleman referred us to Indian trea-
ties and other claims wh ch have been admitted
and icknowledged as due, but he forgot to tell us
that those are funded debts, and the Treasury can
make no paymentSj eicept as puthorued by law,
but wlnt have been made, and are now an homed
lo be made, wi hout new legislation upon iho^e
chums Bat let us kok to the ppsiponemenls
which ihe gtntlemi i presente 1 as evnlerce of the
violation ot gond faph on the part of the Govern-
ment I have often, lierete f re, made an "Spiil
fool" of myself by examining in o charges made
hue af unit the Admintsti Ion I have also ex-
amined this charge, and find vnxself moie fooled
than ever
After the gentlemm told us of fifly instances of
postponed claims whien he had heard of, (and all
of which he believed,) he presented one, the evi-
dence of which, he informe 1 us, was on a piece ol
p pei which he held in his hand, bat re
fus d to give us the name of the individual
who vouched fori s trut That clara is rep'esent-
cd io be nineteen dollar. He further stated lhat
claims fi r labor done on the public Hi kbngs m
Ihis place were postpon d, and a reduction oi
cierra of Ihe amount fiM snpulated lo be paid.
The gcntlemm from Virg nia ¡Mr Wisf] rose
ml p Med a facf of the s3tne kind to tne list of
posiponeratnts II sad ll it he nad =een eircu-
Urs psued by an I onty, ink rmino- those who had
