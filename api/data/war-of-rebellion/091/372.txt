HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DISTRICT OF HARPER'S FERRY,Harper's Ferry, W. Va., October 14, 1864.

Major FRENCH,

Commanding Remount Camp, Pleasant Valley, Md.:

MAJOR: Move with all of your available cavalry at once to Point of Rocks, Md.; unite your force with the forces in that vicinity, and attack a body of rebel cavalry near Adamstown. The rebel force is reported to be between 200 and 300. If they have moved from that point, follow them up and capture or destroy them.

By order of Brigadier General J. D. Stevenson:

H. W. PITCHER,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.

MARTINSBURG, October 14, 1864-5 a.m.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

The night passenger from the Ferry was attacked some three miles west of Kearneysville. Part of the train is reported to have been burned and the track slightly damaged. The train east was signaled, and returned to Martinsburg in safety. I have sent out two scouting parties, and will give you facts in detail as soon as I can obtain them. The number of the attacking party is estimated variously from 100 to 200. I have no faith, however, in there being more than 100, at most. I shall send out a construction party to repair damages at once.

W. H. SEWARD,

Brigadier-General.

MARTINSBURG, October 14, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

An officer just arrived from Kearneysville reports that the train was attacked two miles east of that place, instead of west. All the passengers were robbed, including Major Moore, a paymaster, with $80,000. The attacking party then made off toward the Winchester road. I have a scouting party after them and hope to overhaul some of them.

W. H. SEWARD,

Brigadier-General.

MARTINSBURG, October 14, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

Citizens arriving from beyond Bunker Hill report positively that Mosby is concentrating his men two or three miles the other side of that place. So far as I can learn, all small parties on the Winchester pike yesterday were attacked. I fear that the telegrams for General Sheridan sent out yesterday afternoon were captured, but have no positive information as to the fact. My scouting party has returned without success. Major Moore and Major Ruggles, paymasters, were both captured on the train last night.

W. H. SEWARD,

Brigadier-General.
