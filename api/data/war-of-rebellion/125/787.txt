Washington, D. C., October 18, 1864.

Honorable E. B. WASHBURNE,

Galena, Ill.:

The Secretary of War is absent and it would be a direct violation of his orders for me to grant the request for fifteen days made in your dispatch of yesterday.

JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.

CINCINNATI, October 19, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Washington, D. C., October 19, 1864.

Honorable B. F. WADE,

Cincinnati, Ohio:

I sent Colonel Wilcox orders on the 17th instant to investigate into affairs of Hamilton County and if the complaints made were well founded to suspend draft there and report facts. He was directed to let the draft proceed if he found it was being made fairly and in accordance with the law and rules prescribed by the Secretary of War and applied to other districts.

JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.

PHILADELPHIA, PA., October 19, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

A draft is ordered to-morrow in the Second District of this city. The district is full, except the First sub-District, which is putting in men very fast. Its quota will be filled by volunteering faster than by draft. All the other districts of this city are full. These should be no draft here. Please have it suspended. We send this also to the President, fearing you may be absent.

SIMON CAMERON.

Actg. Asst. Provost-Marshal-General, Philadelphia, Pa.:

I am examining certain papers connected with the quota of Philadelphia. Do not draft to-morrow. I will notify you when to proceed.
