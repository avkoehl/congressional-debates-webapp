called to my aid the quartermaster's department, the members of which have cheerfully performed all the duties required of them. The report of the acting quartermaster-general, Major Fitzhugh, will disclose the character and extent of these operations, and is herewith respectfully submitted. *

In connection with this subject I have to call your attention to the rights of the State over the railroads within her limits. By the twenty-third section of chapter 41 of the Code it is provided that "troops, persons, and munitions, &amp;c., and other property of the Confederate States shall in time of war be required to pay only one-half of the regular tolls payable by other persons. " The construction put upon the railroad law by the managers of these roads, sustained by the opinion of the attorney-general, is that Virginia is not included in this provision, and that freight upon her goods and persons traveling in her service are charged as the persons and property of private individuals. this discrimination is certainly very unjust to the State, especially as she is a large stockholder in all of said roads, Some of the roads, it is true, have put the State upon the same footing with the Confederate Government, but that is at the pleasure of the management of the road, and ought to be regulated by law. In North Carolina and other states the practice obtains, I suppose by authority of law, that whenever the Governor requires a train on the road for the public use he issues his order to the particular road upon which transportation is required, and it is promptly furnished to the exclusion of all other demands whatever. I respectfully suggest that a similar law be enacted, conferring upon the Governor the same authority.

Allow me to suggest a careful examination into the business operations of our railroads. Undoubtedly they are far from affording to the traveler that comfort, celerity, and dispatch which was expected at the time of their construction. This is hardly denied by the managers of the roads, and their excuse is the pressure of the Government business and the difficulty of obtaining the requisite materials and hands to keep them in proper order. Others say, however, that the fault consists in their failure to apply their receipts to repairs, equipments, and construction, growing out of their eagerness to pay off their debts. Without professing to know how the fact is, the inconvenience to the public calls for a careful investigation.

I have the honor to lay before you for your consideration the annual report of the adjutant-general. * It embraces the report of the ordnance department. Like all the reports of this old and valuable officer, it abounds in wise and practical suggestions, which I recommended to your favorable consideration.

I submit likewise the report of the attorney-general. *

From my late connection with the Army I could but learn the great inconvenience and expense to which our soldiers are put in the adjustment of their claims against the Confederate Government. The claims of the widows and orphans of those who had died or been killed in battle were also difficult of adjustment for want of proper information and the great expense of prosecuting them before the Government, resulting frequently in their abandonment, or in the employment of agents at a ruinous compensation. I felt that some provision should be made for an easier and cheaper collection of these highly meritorious demands. With this view I ordered Colonel Henry Hill, paymaster-general of the State, without existing employment, to undertake the
