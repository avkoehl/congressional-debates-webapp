THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 1,
3?urtfoermore, millions of dollars have been already
expended in securing a moiety of this burnt timber,
toy parties relying upon the good faith of the G-overn-
mentthat the tariff would not be materially altered.
If this bill had been anticipated this expenditure
would have been saved, as4it is feared by some that
the market will be glutted without the admission of
foreign lumber. The operation of thebili, if passed,
will be to take from one class of sufferers to con-
fer a doubtful benefit upon another class no more
unfortunate, save from the fact that they had more
to lose.
Again, we regard the bill as an insidious attempt
to enrich or relieve a tew at the expense of the many,
as we cannot imagine how the operation of the law-
can be so guarded as not to lead to immense frauds.
As a matter of relief, the concession prayed for is
too trivial to be worthy of special legislation, and
we cannot but believe that this is a proj ect to secure
much more than the bill on its face concedes.
The annual receipts of lumber in Chicago is about
one thousand million feet, and probably not more
than forty million feet will be used in rebuilding in
that city next year.
Purthermore, if any part of the country has claims
for special legislation on account of its misfortunes,
we ask that relief should be equally distributed to
allsections alike, and not alone to a city whose relief
has been as pronounced and theatrical as its catas-
trophe,amd whose pecuniary losses have been greatly
alleviated by foreign insurance companies.
Wo believe thatnqne would be benefited by this
bill but Canadian lumbermen and Chicago lumber
dealers.
Hoping that you will concur in our views and use
your influence to defeat this bill, we remain, yours,
truly. CHARLES MERRILL & CO.,

These men are engaged in the lumber busi-
ness in the State oi' Michigan. I hold in my
hand another letter, dated the day following,
addressed to my colleague in the other House,
Hon. Mr. Coxger, winch has been handed me
since that time:
Detroit, January 24,1872.
"Die a it Sir: Our attention has been cnlled to a bill
now bofore the Senate, which has already passed the
House, culled, wo believe, a relief bill lor ihe suf-
ferers ot Uhicngo.
In our opinion, if that bill should pass, it would
do great injustice to the lumber interests of the
burned districts of Michigan and Wisconsin, who
arej proportionately, equal if not greater losers and
sufferers than those ot Chicago.
We know you are well posted as to the great ex-
tent of territory devastated bv the great fires of
October last. Besides the groat loss of life and of
mills and manuiactured lumber, of cattle, hay. pro-
duce, &<i.> hundreds of thousands of acres of pine
lands were burnod ovor and the timber killed. In
order to save as nniefa as possible of the pine timber
in those burned districts from total loss by worms,
wo have all been compelled to make the greatest
possible efforts to out and haul the burned timber
into the rivers and creeks. These efforts haveoaused
a largo inere;iso in men and supplies, and a propor-
tionately huge increase in prices ot labor and of
some of the materials used in the lumbering busi-
ness, labor being not less than twenty per cent,
above last year's prices, and hay about doublo.
Now, we know that in consequoueo of tho^o fires,
and the increased efforts of the lumbermen ol Mich-
igan and Wisconsin, made necessary by reason of
them, a veiy large increase overt the usual quantity
of logs are being put in this winter, and au over-
stock of lumber in Chicago the ensuing season must,
inevitably follow. Now, in view ot these facts, and
the certain fail in the ruling prices of lumber in
Chicago, which is surely to be the result, we cannot
believe that Congress will, after fully understanding
the situation, do so great an injustice as to virtually
admit Canada lumber free, which we eapnot doubt
would be almost ruinous to the already suffering
lumbermen ot those burned district?. We have not
the slightest objection to any reasonable relief which
Congress may think proper to afford to the sufferers
of Chicago, provided such relief can bo granted
without injury to other equally differing interests.
If such relief is to be granted m some way, and no
other practical and more just method oi doing it than
the bill under consideration atiords, v, c as&ure you
that the lumbermen of Michigan would much prefer
to subscribe all the reliet that this bill would afford,
so iar at least as the reoate on lumber is concern cd,
than to have this bill become a law. We hope you
will do all in your power to arrest the passage of the
bill, and thus prevent a great injustice to a vital in-
terest iu our btate.
Very truly, yours. AVERY & MURPHY,
„r , EDWIN ED1)Y.
Hon. 0. D. Congkr, Washington.
This is signed by some of the heaviest lum-
ber dealers iu the State. I said the other day
that I hoped so gross an injustice would not
be done to these suffering meu in the States
of Wisconsin and Michigan. I hope that the
bill will be reconsidered and will be referred
to the Committee on Finance, for the reason
that since I spoke the other day a large dele-
gation of men from the lumber interests have
arrived in this city, and desire to give their
views before that committee. It will not delay
it for more than one day, for the chairman of
the Committee on Finance assured me that he
would listen to them immediately. They can
be heard before that committee, and he can
report the bill after that hearing the next day.
It will lead to no delay. It is a simple act of
justice and of courtesy to these parties, and I
hope the Senate will reconsider this vote and
let the Committee on Finance adopt some
other method for the relief of the sufferers of
Chicago than this, and I assure them that I
will go with them in any reasonable measure
of relief that they may propose.
Mr. SHERMAN. I have voted for the Chi-
cago relief bill, as it is called, in all it stages.
I voted against the amendment proposed by
the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Morrill]
because I did not wish to discriminate against
a western city in favor of an eastern city. I
felt bound to follow the example set by Con-
gress in the case of Portland. The practical
result of the experiment in Portland was not
any very great injury to the public revenue.
The whole amount of drawbacks paid in the
case of Portland was but $21,000, and I am
rather inclined to think that the amount of
drawbacks drawn under this bill, if it passes,
would be greatly overstated at $500,000.
But I intend to vote for the reconsideration
for this reason: that, after disinterested reflec-
tion, I am satisfied that the amendment offered
by the Senator from Vermont ought to have
been adopted; that we ought to specify the
articles upon which the drawback shall oper-
ate. I wish to have read for the information
of the Senate an article in the Chicago Xrib*
une, published since we had the debate -the
other day, to show that the construction
already put on this act by the people of Chi-
cago would create very great and serious em-
barrassment by extending this relief to a mul-
titude of articles so numerous as to make the
number of demands on the Treasury almost
as countless as the sands of the sea-shore. I
ask the Secretary to read the paragraph I have
marked iu the paper I send to the desk.
The Chief Clerk read as follows, from the
Chicago Tribune of January 26, 1872:
"Removal of the Tax on Building Materials.—The
passage by the Senate of the act allowing a draw-
back of duties on building materials imported for
use in the burned district of Chicago will have a
controlling offect upon the prices of those articles in
this market. A a general thing, the effect will be
to reduce prices to the extent ot the dtity, which is
calculated on the price in the foreign port and all
charges thereon up to the time of arrival at the
American port, and is payable in gold. We give a
list of the leading articles with the rates of duty in
gold:

" It does not follow that we are to purchase all of
these articles we may need from foreign countries ;
but, as we eau get them at the prices ruling in
Toronto, Montreal, Liverpool, or elsewhere, that
tact must necessarily regulate prices here. The
impression that there wiU be' complications and
difficulties in the execution of this law is not well
founded. A precisely similar law was passed in the
case of Portland, and the regulations then adopted
by the Treasury Department, under which the law
was executed, can, we suppose, be renewed, so far
as they may bo jubt, in the case of Chicago. The
people of Chicago, by making an estimate of how
much of each of these several articles will be needed
to rebuild the burned district, and deducting from
thoir co-dt a sum equal fo the percentage of tax, will
be able to appreciate the extent of this exemption,
and yet have the consolation of knowing that the
Government will lose very little revenue."
Mr. SHERMAN. I-have had tbis list, read
merely to show that the multitude of articles
that would be embraced under the general
language of the bill would make this bill prac-
ticably' inoperative. ■ For instance, how could
a drawback claim be made out for a' bar' or
two of iron that enters into a building, or a
few wood screws, or for flags, or for articles
of that kind where but a small portion of them
enters into a building'-'and contributes but a
little to the cost. The effect-will be to dis-
