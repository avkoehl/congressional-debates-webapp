HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND,Big Shanty, Ga., June 12, 1864 - 6 p. m.

Major-General HOWARD:

What further information have you of the enemy's movements on your right? It is reported to me that he is retreating. General Stanley's report of 1.10 to-day seems to indicate that the report is correct. Have your advance guard keep vigilant to-night and report any movement that they are certain of.

Captain A. C. McCLURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fourteenth Army Corps:

CAPTAIN: The patrols sent out from my line this p. m. have returned and report as follows: The officer sent from my right brigade marched about one mile south, bearing slightly to the east; crossed the Marietta road, or a bug road, supposed to be the Marietta and Burnt Hickory road. In front of this a large open field. Moved by right flank half a mile, when his party drew the fire of the enemy from the direction of our right. The patrol then fell back, in accordance with the instructions given the officer. He reports that this road has evidently been traveled by cavalry to-day. The party from my left brigade went out but a short distance, saw nothing, and, falling in with those from Scribner's brigade, returned.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. W. JOHNSON,

Brigadier-General.
