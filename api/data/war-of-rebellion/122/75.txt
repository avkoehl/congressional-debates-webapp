Accept for yourself and the Administration my hearty thanks for the stand you have taken. Nine-tenths of the people here are with you, and will be so long as a similar policy is followed, and they will be with you in person as well as in sympathy whenever their services are required.

Very respectfully,

SAMUEL J. KIRKWOOD.

INDIANAPOLIS, IND., April 16, 1861.

Honorable S. CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

The six regiments will be full in three days. The rendezvous is at this city. Some companies will march into camp to-morrow morning. I can send you 500 men to Washington to-morrow, but they are not armed. I hope arms, tents, and stores will be sent immediately, and an officer to muster the men into service. Let the officer come at once.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor of Indiana.

[Indorsement.]

Reply: Officer on the way. Arms will be furnished on being mustered.

WAR DEPARTMENT, April 16, 1861.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SIMON CAMBERON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, April 16, 1861.

It will suffice if your quota of volunteers be at its rendezvous by the 20th of May.
