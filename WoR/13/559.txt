
exception of Major General D. H. Hill's division, which remained near Malvern Hill, was moved in the direction of Harrison's Landing, to which point the Federals had retreated, under the shelter of their gunboats in the James River.

On the morning of the 3rd my command arrived near the landing and drove in the enemy's skirmishers, and continued in front of the enemy until the 8th, when I was directed to withdraw my troops and march to the vicinity of Richmond.

For further information respecting the engagements and officers who were distinguished in them I respectfully call attention to the accompanying reports of division and other commanders. The conduct of officers and men was worthy of the great cause for which they were contending.

The wounded received the special attention of my medical director, Dr. Hunter McGuire.

For the efficiency with which the members of my staff discharged their duties I take pleasure in mentioning Colonel S. Crutchfield, chief of artillery; Colonel A. Smead, inspector-general; Major R. T. Dabney and Captain A. S. Pendleton, assistant adjutants-general; Captain J. K. Boswell, chief engineer, and Lieutenant H. K. Douglas, assistant inspector general. Cols. A. R. Boteler and William T. Jackson, volunteer aides, and Major Jasper S. Whiting, assistant adjutant-general, who were temporarily on my staff, rendered valuable service.

The ordnance department received the special attention of Major G. H. Bier. The quartermaster's and commissary departments were well managed by their respective chiefs, Majrs. J. A. Harman and W. J. Hawks.

Undying gratitude is due to God for this great victory, by which despondency increased in the North, hope brightened in the South, and the capital of Virginia and of the Confederacy was saved.
