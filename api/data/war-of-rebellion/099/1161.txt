HEADQUARTERS FIFTH TENNESSEE CAVALRY,In the Field, February 11, 1865.

General McLAWS,

Branchville, S. C.:

GENERAL: Having learned that the enemy had crossed the river at a point two miles above Rowe's Station, I sent a scout to ascertain the facts. Since I sent the scout Lieutenant D. R. Wilson, who commands my pickets at Rowe's Pump, sends me a couried stating that it is false as to enemy having crossed river. There has no enemy crossed river as yet. I have a scout gone go said point at this time, who will report to me to-night. If anything should take place worthy of note I will dispatch you at once. Lieutenant Wilson disptatches me that some of our cavalry had crossed river on scout. On returning to river, the infantry pickets took fright and ran off, reporting the enemy when it was our own men. Lieutenant Wilson dispatches this as coming from General Palmer, who commands infantry force at said pump and bridge.

I am, your obedient servant,

W. W. LILLARD,
