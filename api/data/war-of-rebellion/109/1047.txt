ply. Shall not interfere, but hope the President's attention will be called to this. The entire community and all officers of army and navy opposed this thing with me.

HEADQUARTERS,Wilmington, N. C., October 11, 1864.

His Excellency Governor VANCE:

SIR: The Secretary of War informs me that in Richmond the Governor and the War Department compel all men capable of bearing arms to organize for the defense of the city, and asks me if I cannot obtain your consent to make the same arrangement here. If possible, I beg you will agree to this. Let them have their own officers, their own horses, and the understanding that they will be required only when all business is suspended. What I want is to know upon what I can rely, and that these partiies, of whom there will be 1,000 at least, may know that they are expected and, if necessary, will be obliged to do something for their homes. Casn you give me a favorable answer? I have information direct from New York that Farragut is now busy preparing his expedition. I think you had better commence at least to send forward re-enforcements. Two thousand men would be a Godsend to me now, though I shall want more. I have not enough just now tto keep the n egro labor from running away. I give you the information, which is direct from New York. I hope you will repeat a remonstrance to the President himself against that ill-omened expedition leaving this port. Fortunately, they have not been able to get out this moon; but they are stll impressing coal and thereby endangering all the ships in port, precisely as they caused the loss of your noble ship. Including her, we have paid fro the cruise of the Tallahassee by ten vessesls already. The sentiment of the community and the army and navy is bitterly opposed to it, and unanimously, including even those engaged in the expedition. There will be time for you to use your onfluence, if you agree with me, and I am assured you do, before the expedition can go.* I am thus urgent because we need, and North Carolina needs, these men and guns here at our own doors, especially on the eve of Farragut's approach.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.

RALEIGH, October 14, 1864.

Hon J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

I am informed that my hands at the State salt-works, Saltville, Va., are conscribed. Can you not forbid it? You have stopped my works at Wilmington; ; for God's sake don't deprive this whole community of the means of living for the sake of forty men.

Z. B. VANCE.
