ONE MILE SOUTH OF CRAWFISH SPRING,

September 19, [1863]1.30 p. m.

General ROSECRANS,

Commanding:

GENERAL: Entirely satisfied now that the enemy do not intend attacking our right near this point. I feel confident that the artillery firing that has been going on is a mere demonstration. I should be very careful of the left, and re-enforce it strongly. It is probably their intention to push for Rossville Gap and attempt to turn our left. I feel so sure of this that I would not keep any troops this way that could be used elsewhere, and will take the responsibility of shoving up every thing-I mean toward the Widow Gleen's house, where you can make dispositions of them.

Lieutenant-Colonel and Inspector-General.

NEAR GORDON'S MILLS, September 19, [1863].

General ROSECRANS,

Commanding:

GENERAL: A brigade of Sheridan's division will go forward as rapidly as possible to take the place of Wood, who we learn has gone to the left. Can you send some officer here and let me know just precisely how things are? Any gap in the line by Wood's removal? I will join you at Widow Glenn's house if I don't hear from you in thirty minutes.

ARTHUR C. DUCAT,

Inspector-General.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,In the Field, September 19, 1863-5.35 p. m.

Major-General NEGLEY:

The general commanding wishes to know the result of your advance, how far you have gone, where you will be found, and what you know of Generals Palmer and Reynolds. He thinks if you are not supported you had better halt and take a good position for the night.

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
