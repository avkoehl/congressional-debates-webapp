HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, May 9, 1865.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL OF THE ARMY,

Washington, D. C.:

SIR: I transmit herewith by the hands of Major Thomas, chief quartermaster of this department, copies of two dispatches of the 7th instant which were sent to be telegraphed from Fortress Monroe. *

Yesterday I received a dispatch from Brevet Major-General Wilson, dated at Macon, Ga., on the 1st instant, requesting that his supplies be sent by way of Augusta. The depot which I intended to establish at Darien, Ga., will not therefore be necessary.

In determining the points to be occupied by troops from this command in the interior of the States of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, it becomes necessary that the limits of this department to the westward should be defined. This is more especially the case in Florida. If Tallahassee is to be garrisoned, for example, it can be done more readily and more economically from the Gulf than from the Atlantic coast.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

QUINCY A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, S. C., May 9, 1865.

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you proceed to carry out the requirements of the military convention between Generals Johnston and Sherman, as published in the inclosed General Orders, Numbers 52,+ current series, from these headquarters, by demanding and receiving the surrender of all Confederate forces on your front,
