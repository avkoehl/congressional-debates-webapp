night. He says that some of the officers told him (he does not know the truth of it) that Pickett's and Field's divisions, of Longstreet's corps, same came over. He does know accurately the previous statements. He says that Bushrod Johnson's division, of Beauregard's corps, is here. This prisoner was sent to me by General Sheridan for these facts.

Major-General HANCOCK,Commanding Second Corps:

The commanding general wishes to know what regiment and brigade the prisoner belongs to whose statement you forwarded at 2 p.m. Colonel Sharpe reported the Tennessee brigade, of Beauregard's corps, in your front. From the statements of prisoners sent in by you last night this was Bushrod Johnson's brigade. May not the prisoner confound Johnson's brigade with Johnson's division? The latter consists of five brigades, the Tennessee brigade being one.
