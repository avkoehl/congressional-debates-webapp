COLUMBUS, OHIO, August 1, 1864,

Honorable E. M. STANTON

Secretary of War:

Have been to Cincinnati and arranged for the patrol-boats, but the arrangements for manning them are still on my hands. Please answer the following questions; What number of men to handle the armament shall be assigned to each boat? River men recommend thirty to FIFTY. Will you authorize me to require the assistance of Provost- Marshal to assign men who are duly enlisted for gun-boat service to this particular service while it continues, and then to be turned over to other boats? An officer with the rank of major should be assigned to the command of the whole, and one captain or lieutenant assigned to each boat. I have no officers to assign. Will the Department detail them and furnish me a list? They should report early to Colonel Swords, at Cincinnati.

JOHN BROUGH.
