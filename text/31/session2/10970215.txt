Finances of the Government—Mr. J«m*.
' in reaching those distant ports." Now it doe* II
appear to me tliat, in estimating the rations at 20
cents instead of 15 cents, to cover the expenses |!
specified, it would have been better, and certainly
more satisfactory, it' these several Hems had been
estimated for separately, under the appropriate
heads. The " large wastage and deterioration of
stores in reaching " California, New Mexico, and
the upper Rio Grande, I presume hare already
occurred, and cannot, therefore, be applicable to
the fiscal year 1852, which will not commence for
eight months after the date of the report, unless
the conditions of his contracts for the delivery of
provisions and stores at " these distant posts, in
the year 1859, require him to receive tnem in a
damaged or deteriorated condition. To say the
least of it, I think he has acted very imprudently,
and in total disregard of that economy which
should characterize the conduct of those officers of
the Government who are charged with making
contracts, and the disbursement of public money,
if he had, prior to his last report m 1850, made
contracts for the delivery of "provisions and
stores " at '• those distant poets " in the year 1859.
There is another thing respecting these two re5- j
ports from this officer which I do not understand,
and which I think requires explanation. Not-
withstanding the largely-increased number of per-
sons estimated for, for" the year 1833, OTer those
estimated for for the year 1851, and notwithstand- '
ing the increase of thirty-three and one third per '
cent, in the price of the ration of the former over
the latter year, the estimated expenditures of 185S
are $153,370 63 less than those of the year 1851.
Why this is so we are not informed. These esti-
mates are invariably made upon the basis of the
Ad! legal military establishment, where it is well
known that there is generally a 4eficrt of some
eight or ten per cent, resulting from deaths, dia-1
charges, and desertions.
Ths report of the Quartermaster General of the
Army, accompanying the estimates, ftrmore start- !
ling in amount than even that of the Commissary '
General. The Mm of #4,750,000 is now asked
for the service erf the Quartermaster's Depart-
ment for the year 1853, being $834,046 more than
the estimates for the year 1851, $600,070 94 more
than the entire expenditures of the Army proper
for the year 1846—the first year of the war with
Mexico—and nearly or quite as much as the en-
tire Army should now cost. The increased ex-
penses of this Department, like the other*, are
charged to the Mexican war, and the acquisition
of territory. These are to be made the scape-goat
of the Administration, to bear its sins of extrava-
gance arid wasteful expenditure of public money.
But with regard to the alleged increased expenses
in the Subsistence and Quartermaster's Depart-
ment#, in consequence of transportation of troops,
provisions, and stores to, and supplies famished
at, the distant posts, let as sag how the matter
stands. From the report of the Adjutant General
it appears that there are at the several posts in
Texas and the recently-acquired territory, offi-
cers and men, present and absent, four thousand i
three hundred and thirty-nine persons, distributed ;
as follows: j

nf collecting the revenue from customs
were $400,153 &); the estimated expenses of rev-
enue rolkeuom of the same kind for the remain-
ine three quarters of the year, from October 1,
1830, to June 30, 1851, are fl,500,000—making
together the sum of $1,900,153 The expenses
of collecting the customs revenue are estimated in
the same report for the year commencing July 1,
18(51, and ending June 30, 1853,at |S,450,000, be-
ing $549,847 18 more for the latter than for the
former year in this one item of public expendi-
tures.
Tlie Commissary General of Subsistence, in his
report accompanying the estimates submitted at
the commencement of the last session of Congress,
says:
«• I have the honor to report that the summit of finds now
hi fee Tmw r, and applicable to Army NttuSMr, iatenre
Una Mttcmi to ualwm the Army from this date (October
<3, l&tst) to Jane 30, 1851, and that bo appropriation by

It waa afterwartlaascertained that this supposed
balance remaining in the Treasury as applicable
to that branch of the public service, had been ap-
propriated more than two years, and consequently
in application was prohibited by the Constitution, j
and in the regular Army appropriation bill of the i
session, all that rcmaiaed of this lane sum was I
reappropnated. This estimate for the year 1841
was ansae by the Commissary Geeeral upon the
basis of "9>45 penons, at 15 cents per diem,
365 days." This waa for subsistence in kind,
those who draw rations, and. did not include the
officers of the Army who receive money in lien of
rations.
General Gibson doses his report as follows:
«It nil thas he seen that, after ssbsisMng the Amy dn-
riM fee remainder of fee pteaeat fiscal pear, (to Jane 30,
IMS,) and tor fee aezt fiscal year, (from July 1,1850, to
Jaae 30,1851,) there will remain in the Treasury, the sum
of £697.60? 73, which will be applicable to the subsistence
of the Army fnr the ftsral year ending June 30,1853."
Instead of this sum of $697,608 73 of the sub-
sistence appropriations remaining unexpended on
July 1, 1851, it now appears from the report of
the same officer, accompanying the estimates sub-
mitted at the present session, that $6,355 85 is all
that will remain. Should he be as successful in
spending money from this time until he makes his
next report, as he appears to have been between
the periods of making his last two, a deficit of
hundreds of thousands may be anticipated, rather
than a surplus of a few thousands only.
It ia further shown by the reports of this offi-
cer, that, instead of $544,488 75 being sufficient to
subsist the Army for the year 1851, as estimated
for by him in 1849, he has spent, and will spend
during the year, the sum of $1,235,741 63, con-
siderably more than double the amount he origin-
ally estimated for, and that, too., without any sat-
isfactory reasons justifying this enormous increase
of expenditures over estimates.
The Adjutant General, in his report to the pres-
ent session, shows that there are 12,638 persons,
under the legal establishment, in the Army, who
are subsisted by rations in kind. This increase
in the Army will account, in part, for this increase
in expenditures, but not entirely.
The Commissary General estimates his expend-
itures for subsistence for the year 1852, upon the
basis, " 14,827 persons, 365 days, at 20 cents per
diem, $1,082,371." He says: " In estimating the
' ration at 20 cents, the following expenses are in-
' eluded: Issues to Indians, per act June 30th,
• 1834; expenses of preserving provisions, and
' erecting and repairing bake-ovens. It is also
' proper to add, that the price of the ration has
• been increased by contracts made in California,
• New Mexico, and on the upper Rio Grande, for
'articles of subsistence, to save transportation.
' Also by kfge wastage and deterioration of stores
Total officers and men    4,338—'
of whom five hundred and thirty-nine Are reported
as absent, leaving but three thousand and eight
hundred actually present and in service at " those
distant posts" at the date of the returns; which I
suppose shows pretty fairly the general average
proportion of absentees. These troops are already
at " those distant posts," and, of course, will not
have to be transported to them, unless the powers
that be shall think proper to order them home and
to send out others in their places. The expendi-
tures of the Quartermaster s Department cannot
be estimated for with even as much precision as
those of the Subsistence Department, depending, aa
they do to a very great extent, upon the movements
,| of the Army. The, estimates far ti^ year. 1852
for the Quartermaster 'a Department are much
larger, in proportion, than were the expenditures
of tlie same department in any one of the yearn
during the war with Mexico, when almost our en-
tire army waa in the enemy's country and almost
continually moving; requiring extraordinary' ex-
penditures for the various kinds of transportation
incident to an invading army. This fact of itself
is conclusive, at least to my mind, that these esti-
mates are extravagantly large, and should not be
granted without the strictest scrutiny, and saVw-
factory reasons 'that the public interests require
their appropriation and expenditure.
The Quartermaster General thinks the service
of his department will require the extraordinary
appropriations for which lie has estimated, because
of our acquisition of territory and the distant posts,
therein. He says that " in the year ending the
30th of June, 1844, the whole expenditure for
Army transportation amounted to §115,399 25; in
the year ending the 30th of June last, accounts
already received and examined show an expendi-
ture of §1(913,722; accounts to be received will
swell this expenditure to over two millions; and
that amount I have estimated for the next fiscal
year." Why this is done we are not informed,
nor can I conceive. The troops are already in the
new and distant Territories, in sufficient numbers
for att practical and useful purposes.
The Commissary General of Subsistence largely
increases his estimates, because " the price of the
ration has been increased by contracts made in
California, New Mexico, and on the upper Rio
Grande, for articles of subsistence, to save trans-
portation." The one or the other of these esti-
mates it seems to me must be wrong. If contract*
liave been made for the delivery of articles of sub-
sistence at " those distant posts "to pave transport-
ation, of course the expense of transporting them
will not hare to be paid. On the other hand, if the
, articles are to be purchased and received in the
j old States and transported to the posts where re-
< quired at the expense of the Quartermaster 's De-
partment, the Subsistence Department should not
estimate for the increased price of the ration.
. Accompanying the estimates submitted by ths
Secretary of the Treasury at the commencement
of tlie present session, is a letter or report from
the Quartermaster General, showing the "total a-
, limuUtt fiir the QuarttrsMsfer'i IMfxttimtnt" for the
I year 1852, to be "#4,750,000."
Accompanying tlie annual report of the Secre-
' tary of the Treasury oil the state of the finances,
December 16, 1850, is • letter and statement, (L.
No. 1,) from the same officer, showing the in-
creased annual expenditures en account of the
Quartermaster's Departmentfor tlie last six years,
and the supposed and estimated expenditures for
the years 1851 and 1852.
Front this statement or table it appears that the es-
timated expenditures for the fecal year eodingJune
30th, 1852, are $4,992,538 65, which is #342,538 63
more than the estimates submitted by the Quarter-
master General, for the same year, at the eotn-
mencementof the session, dated November 4,1850.
This discrepancy, however, can be accounted for
on the ground of an ascertained or anticipated de-
. ficiency which will occur in the appropriations for
the service of the Quartermaster a Department in
the year 1852, discovered on the 11th of Novem-
ber, 1850, seven days after the estimates were pre-
pared.
By the reports of the AdjtttantGsneral, it appear*
that in 1846 there were in- the military service of
the country 37,180 persons, officers and men; of
j whom 24,984 were in the field, and 2,196 at the
forts and stations in the Eastern abd Western
divisions of the Ifnited States. The aggregate ex 
penditures of the Quartermaster's Department for
that year was $2,327,302 13, which wasan averago
expenditure per man of #86 63. The war was
not declared until May 13th, 1846, and consequent-
ly but little of the increased expenses, on account
of ths wart were actually paid before the expira*
tion of the fiscal year.
The report of the Adjutant General of Novem-
ber 4,1847,shows that "thearmy in the campaign,
regulars and volunteers," was 43,536, and at forts-
and stations in the Eastern and Woe tarn division*
of the army 2,424 officers and men—aggregate
1 45,960. The total expenditures of tit* Quarter-.
: master's Department, for the. year 1847,
