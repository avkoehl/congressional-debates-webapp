Mr. RIVES submitted the following, which lies over
Whereas, by the Constitution of the United States, it is pro-
vided 'that the House of Representatives shall be composed of
members chosen every second year by the people of the several
States," and, whereas, by the laws of New Jersey, it is made
the duty of the Governor, or person administering the Govern
mentand Privy Council of that State, todeterminethe six per-
sons who have the greatest number of votes from the whole
State for Representative  m Congress of the United States,
which six persons the Governor, or person administering the
Government, shall forthwith commission, under the great seal
of the State, to represent thatState in the House of Repiesen
tatives of the Congress of the United States; and whereas it
has been charged that the Governor of New Jer«ey did, in vio
lation of the Constitution of the United States, the laws of his
own State, and one of the most important political rights of
the people over Whom he was presiding, commission five per-
sons to represent said people, when he knew that five other
persona had received a majority of the whole number of votes
cast m the last election of members of Congress, and thereby
rendering it necessary for the House of Representative to
"judge of the*lections, returns, and qualifications" of the per-
sona thus returned as Representatives aforesaid, and whereas
on an examination of the evidence to sustain tha charges
aforesaid, it appears that the Governor aforesaid did, in
direct violation of the Constitution of the United States,
and the laws of his own State, arrogate to himself the
right U> commission persons as members of Congress
who were not "chosen by the people," and imperiously says,
"whether my decision in granting the certificates was light or
wrong, Congress, at all events, is bound to receive the cieden
Hals thus furnished, as the mandate of the State," although the
same was founded in fraud, and designed to effect an organiza-
tion of this House opposed to the popular will And whereas,
by the lawless "and unprecedented" act of the aforesaid Go
vernor, the people of New Jersej*have been deprived ol their
right io representation on this floor—"a right inestimable to
them, and hateful to tyrants only " And whereas the election
of members to represent the State of New Jersey in the House of
Representatives of the United States belongs to the people of
that State, and it is the duty of this House to protect them in
their legitimate and constitutional lights is that particular
against invasion and usurpation, from whatever quarter it may
come And whereas this House alone has power to remove the
grievance complained of, and themorninz hour allotted to the
consideration of that business being insufficient to complete the
same as speedily as is desirable
Resolved, That the report of the Committee of Elections,
relating to the same, be made the special order of the day for
to-morrow, at Ihe hour of twelve o'clock, and to continue the
special order of the day on every subsequent day, at the hour
aforesaid, until the said report shall be disposed of
