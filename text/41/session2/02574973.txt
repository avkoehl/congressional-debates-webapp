peaceful Indian communities. When this sys-
tem becomes generally prevalent it will cease
to be expensive, for the Indians will have
become self-supporting.
I think it is one of the best auguries of the
times that the religious world is taking an
interest in this Indian question. It is strange,
it is a pity, that the sympathy now awakened
has so long slept. I believe, however, it has
been awaiting its opportunity, and that the
first opportunity has just been given by those
in power. If there is any reproach it is that
an opportunity has not been before demanded
in tones not to be disregarded. "With some
exceptions, also, the press have demanded that
justice and mercy be extended to the Indians.
The day is past when the public will believe
that all the wrong is by the Indian in the fre-
quent conflicts and brawls on the border. I
know the Indian is sometimes cruel and sav-
age ; that he sometimes in wantonness, and
sometimes in anger, does deeds of deviltry
that sting the ears to hear. In Arizona he has
nearly taken possession of the Territory by
cruel and relentless war. I know that he is
an uncomfortable neighbor in his savage state,
and that even among the partially civilized his
passions or his tastes are apt to crop out in
deeds of blood and perhaps of treachery. But
yet civilization ejects from its bosom many
men who take to the border, who are a terror
alike to the decent pioneer and a scourge to the
Indian ; devils of crimes as malicious and cruel
as ever Indian committed, who make of every
Indian, friend or foe, a target, and give occa-
sion for many of the outbreaks that bring re-
proach and vengeance on the Indian. If one
Indian does a wrong, another or several other
innocent ones are killed for it!
Then, in some cases our military have taken
the false witness of worthless knaves against
Indians, and they have massacred whole vil-
lages of men, women, and children for a lie.
The Indians revolt against our military posts,
and allege that they only lead to quarrels, the
debauching of their women, the drunkenness
of their braves, the demoralization and oppres-
sion of their people. There must be some
truth in these constant complaints. Then, con-
sider the hard bargains we have constantly
driven with these Indians; our purchase of
their lands in the most fertile spots of Amer-
ica for a song; the payment to them so often
in rotten goods of the pittance promised; their
banishment to sterile lands, where their only
resource is the hunt for disappearing game;
and finally our refusal, necessitated by the
highest call for self-preservation, to allow them
the use of their best hunting grounds.
As a people we have been hard and selfish
with these barbarous neighbors ever since we
seized their continent. Much of our dealings
with them has arisen from the necessity of the
case or from thoughtlessness, but the result
has been the same as if premeditatedâ€”the
murder of a people. They have resisted at
many steps of the progress, sometimes with
the energy of despair, sometimes with the
malice ot revenge. Some of them still fight
ns with such weapons of cunning or force as
are left to them. It is a hopeless fight, and
they know it; but who goes to the wall without
a struggle? I believe that if the Indians had
the means of subsistence, and knew that they
could rely on the good faith of our Govern-
ment and be safe from injury and insult of
base white men, there would never ho another
Indian war on the continent, and the cases of
Indian crime would be rare. I may, perhaps,
except Arizona, where the Indian expects to
expel the white man, and has never been
taught his'power, numbers, and resources.
1 do not believe that the way to keep peace
with the Indians is to ratify the absurd treaties
of the summer of 1867. The real way is to
provide l'or their present wants with decent
liberality, and induce them, if possible, to
change their nomadic habits into more settled
ones, giving them the means so to do. That
is less expensive than war by far, and it is
just, honorable, and humane. But do not let
us throw away money on so-called treaties that
the Indians reject as frauds, and which are not
only^ unsatisfactory to them, but absurd and
irrational.
With the details of the Senate amendments
I propose to deal under the five-minutes de-
bate. Some ofthetn are provided for in the
miscellaneous bill which we passed yesterday,
and may be stricken from this bill. I think
the Indian service of the next fiscal year can
be amply provided for, and yet from one to
two millions be saved from the Senate bill.
