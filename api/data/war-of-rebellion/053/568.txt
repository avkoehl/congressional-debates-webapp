General MACKALL,

Chief of Staff, Chattanooga:

Have just received following telegraphic dispatch from General Frazer at Cumberland Gap:

I am carrying out your order. Have over forty days' rations, and believe I can hold out that time. No enemy this side of Barboursville.

J. W. FRAZER,

Under the circumstances shall I give other orders than those you sent me? He cannot join me here, but if he evacuates must move toward Abingdon. Please answer at once while line to gap is working.
