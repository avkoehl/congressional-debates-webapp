Major GEORGE B. DRAKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Dept. of the Gulf:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report to you that I have received the following information from Judge Baldwin, a loyal citizen of Austin, who has been confined in jails at San Antonio and Anderson, Grimes County, from the 9th of October, 1863, to the 21st of July, 1864, at which time he was released and sent across the Rio Grande at Eagle Pass by order of General Magruder, viz: Re-enforcements are being sent to Ford from Eastern Texas; two batteries of six guns each have been ordered to report to him. He has now about 1,500 troops which can be assembled in a short time, and I am of the opinion that it is his intention to station quite a large force between this place and Brownsville in order that cotton may be crossed into Mexico, with safety and military supplies received from and through that country. I have not learned as yet whether an attack against this place is designed or not, but shall be at any time prepared for such an event. Judge Baldwin leaves to-day for New Orleans, per steamer Suwanee, and will give you further information, as he will for that purpose call at department headquarters.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. M. DAY,

Colonel, Commanding U. S. Forces, Brazos Santiago, Tex.
