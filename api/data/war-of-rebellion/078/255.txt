no terms should be given the rebel party, as they are undeniably out of the pale of law. What further rations do you want from here? I am sure you can live on the country and move freely by reason of it. When do you start? I do not think they have in all over 800 available men to oppose you.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I have ordered the Pennsylvania regiment to Gallipolis, as it is more needed there than at Johnston's Island. There is not a company of the Veteran Reserve Corps that can be spared from guarding prisoners to man gun-boats.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff, Washington, D. C.:

The regiment was sent to Gallipolis as the necessities there for more troops are more pressing than at Johnston's Island. I have now, in five prisoners, by the last returns, 23,646 rebel prisoners, many of them officers, and more troublesome, guarded by 6,673 men, including in this latter number 340 Second Battalion Veteran Reserve Corps. This force is barely sufficient to prevent the prisoners
