THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
of Congress or of the Legislative Assemblies of the
Territories aforosaid, inconsistent with the provis-
ions of this act, are hereby declared null and void.
Mr. SUMNER. Let that be stricken out.
Mr. WADE. Very well; let it be struck out,
tlien.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. WADE. Now I move to strike out all
of the bill after the enacting clause, and to
insert the following:
That in all the Territories of the United States
there shall be no denial to citizens of the United
States of the elective franchise by reason of race or
color, and all persons shall be equal before the law.
And all acts or parts of acts, either of Congress or of
the Legislative Assembly of any Territory, inconsist-
ent with the provisions of this act, are hereby de-
clared null and void.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I object to hurrying this
bill through without any consideration. It
seems to be a new proposition, and there is
some phraseology employed that may be more
comprehensive than Senators suppose. In all
the Territories, according to this proposed
amendment, all persons are to be equal before
the law. I should like to know what that
means before I vote to incorporate into the
organic acts of the Territories such phraseol-
ogy as that. What is the precise meaning and
effect of it? Suppose an Indian should insist
upon the right to sit upon a jury. He is
authorized to do so, and his right cannot be
denied by that amendment. All persons are
to be equal before the law, without distinc-
tion of raee or color or sex, according to that
amendment. I wish Senators to remember
that in the Territories there is a very large
population of wild, untamed Indians, and m
attempting to provide for the black race within
the States I think Senators ought not to use
language that will put those Indians in the
Territories who are wholly unfit to perform
any of the duties of a citizen, who are wholly
unable to perform any of the duties of a citi-
zen, on an equal footing, and entitle them to
all the rights and privileges which the white
people of the Territories enjoy.
Mr. WADE. That is not the intention. Does
not the amendment use the word "citizen?"
I believe it does.
Mr. WILLIAMS. No, sir; it says "all
persons shall be equal before the lawand I
think that such phraseology as that in legis-
lation is exceedingly dangerous. Specify what
particular rights you intend the people of the
Territories should possess. If you will say that
the citizens ofthe Territories shall have the right
to vote, then I will agree to the proposition.
Mr. WADE. I am willing to restrict it in
that way. That is what it means.
Mr. WILLIAMS. Or if you desire that they
shall have any other rights, and you specify
them, then I can understand for what I vote ;
but to use that sort of phraseology, that " all
persons shall be equal before the law," when
there are so many ramifications of government
and society to which the language applies,
seems to me to be a dangerous mode of legis-
lation. I hope this amendment will not be
adopted in this hasty manner.
Mr. LANE. I move that the Senate do now
adjourn.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate
adjourned.

Mr. WASHBURNE^ of Illinois, Has the
morning hour commenced?

question of privilege.
Mr. CHANLER. Mr. Speaker, I hold that
a vote given in this House by a member of this
body is one of the most important acts that a
member can possibly perform; and the record
of that vote I hold to be a matter of the first
importance. And I rise to ascertain from the
Speaker the position held upon this floor by
the reporters of the Associated Press; if they
are officers of this House under the resolution
which admitted them to this floor, or whether
they are not. If they be officers of this House,
I hold that the Journal, the record of the pro-
ceedings of this House, is the only standard
whereby they can publish to the press of the
country the votes given upon this floor. Have
the reporters of the Associated Press the right,
by changing the record of this House and in-
terpolating their opinion relative to a vote here
given, thereby to change the position of a mem-
ber of this body, so far as their act can do it?
That is the question. Now, sir, the special
instance in regard to which I rise is the record
of the vote taken on the resolution of impeach-
ment.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I call the
gentleman to order. I want to know whether
this is a question of privilege or not.
Mr. CHANLEll. I wish to know whether
it is or is not.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from New
York is statinc his question of privilege.
Mr. CHANLER. I wish to know if the
privilege of a member of this House includes
the record of his vote as published by the re-
porters of the Associated Press, who are upon
this floor by the permission of the House.
