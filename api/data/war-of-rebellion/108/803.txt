(Received Staunton, Va., 19th.)

Major-General EARLY:

Dispatch received. Will communicate with Lee and General Echols. Averell was at New CAstle yesterday; stopped by high water. He may take the Rich Patch route to Potts Creek across to Dunlap's Creek, and come in near Callaghan's, or the Salt Pond, or the Sweet Springs route. I will endeavor to find out which.
