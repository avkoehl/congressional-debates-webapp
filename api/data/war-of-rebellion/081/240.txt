From what I can learn of the line I think our left ought to rest on the Norfolk railroad. The only good camping-ground is in the vicinity of the Avery house. Will this location answer? We would be between the main turnpike road to Norfolk and the Norfolk railroad. I will be back here in a few minutes for your answer.
