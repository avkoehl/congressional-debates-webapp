his detachment returned this evening. He went as far as Sucker Creek on the Fort Boise road. Saw nor heard any Indians in that vicinity, and learned from settlers that Colonel Maury had returned to Fort Boise. Unless my express, which is due to-morrow, brings some orders to the contrary I shall start with 100 men on the morning of the 2nd of September, intending to move south as far as Pueblo Mountain, and from thence west to the claim of lake running near north and south, the largest of which is called Lake Christmas, and perhaps as far west as Lake Abert. Lieutenant Colonel Drew, First Oregon Cavalry, with his command encamped near me on the 35th instant. He moves in the morning for Fort Boise. Colonel Drew informs me that he saw several bands of Indians in the region which I propose to visit, but as he was so encumbered with a large train of citizens, including several families, he could not pursue them into the mountains. I will take with me thirty days' rations, but will endeavor to get back to this camp by the 20th proximo if I can.

HDQRS. EXPEDITION INTO THE INDIAN COUNTRY, Camp No. 82, Nevada Territory, September 10, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report for the information of the general commanding that on the 2nd of September I took up my line of march for the south and west, and arrived at this camp on the evening of the 8th, where I was obliged to halt on account of sickness in my command. The trouble with my men is the bloody flux. I will start in the morning, and if not prevented by the continuance of that disease will carry out the line proposed in my last. At this camp I found one of the bands of Indians seen by Colonel Drew, and found them to be Pi-Utes, and not inclined to do mischief. I would have captured the entire party and sent them to the Pi-Ute Reservation, but the shortness of my remaining time would not permit me to go so far south as that. I think when winter pinches them they will steal stock to live upon, as they are very poor. This camp is situated sixty miles south-southwest of Camp Alvord and about ninety miles from Warner Lake, and about forty miles south of the Oregon line.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,GEO. B. CURREY,
