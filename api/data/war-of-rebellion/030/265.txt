A prisoner, just captured, reports that Breckinridge, with his division, is but a few hundred yards in front of us. Your dispatch of 5.15 received.

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,

DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,

December 29, 1862-9 p.m.

General CRITTENDEN:

The order to occupy Murfreesborough was based on information received from General Palmer, that the enemy was running. You did right not to attempt its execution. General will soon ride to front. Buckner can't be before you. Reconnoiter well in front and flank. Try and open signal communication with McCook, who is only 3 miles off.

J. P. GARESCHE,

Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS, December 29, 1862-9 p.m.

Major-General CRITTENDEN:

All right. Will be down to the front directly. Be careful not to let camp-fires show where your lines are.

The firing you hear is from McCook. Stanley writes from Edwards' Hill, 11 o'clock a.m., that he had met no enemy. Country people said they were evacuating Murfreesborough. Cars seen running south. McCook just behind Stanley.

Chief of Staff.
