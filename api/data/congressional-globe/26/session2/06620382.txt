about,) affected by thi« base, spurious, "pa-
per inflated currency'" Sir, this is exceeding-
ly plain to every practical Southern farmer
and planter in the country; and, sir, here
ihey are affected precisely as are tie home manu-
facturers, by the "inflated currency of the bank pa-
per;" to them, every article and commodity, for use
and consumption, provisions, labor, necessaries of
clothing, the price of slaves, stock, superintendents'
wages, mechanical repairs, and every conceivable
commodity connected with their farming and plant-
ing establishments, and with the indispensable sup-
plies necessary for their cultivation—all these sta-
ple commodities of lice, tobacco, and cotfen, are
produced and are purchased at the high and exor-
bitant prices given to them by the factitious, "in-
flated currency of bank paper," thereby forcing, by
this operation of the system, the Southern planter
to purchase all necessaries for carrying on his
business m the home markets at ihe highest pricss,
produced by the "bank paper system," and forcirg
him to sell his production in foreign markets, at
the low prices arising from a i.ore stable specie
currency or its equivalenis. Our cotton, rice, and
tobacco are sold, in the foreign markets, at the
lowest cash price , and are grown and produced
here, wiih all the means necessary for their pro-
duction acquired at the hiehest possible "infla ed
paper currency" prices Yes, sir, yes, this is the
actual condition of Ihe Souih,over which they have
groaned and slept for Ihe last twenty five year*, and
more, for the want, sir, in my judgment, of practi
cal men and praciical politicians among them to
expose the enormity of the system, and the direct
inflictions of it, from which they have suffered so
much and so long.
Now, Mr. Chairman, I have endeavored lo
show, and have at least satisfied mj own mind, that
the whole banking system, with a National Bank
at the head, has operated most ruinously and de
stracttvely, not only upon the great planting, labor-
ing, and productive interests of ihe nation, but llut
it has operated as a withering blight lo the great
American manufacturing interests themselves, and
which I think will be shown lo evoiy intelligent,
practical man, as e'ear as the sunbeams, who will
fully and impir ¡ally examine the subject in all u¡>
bearings upon American interrsb
It has been for these reasons I have taken my
stand against this policy, and though alone I may
be left, am determined to abide ihe usult.
I am, therefore, opposed on those groun Is lo Ihe
abolition of our mini , to make w;iy for ihe moie
effce'ual applicatnn of the enormous system of
banking institutions—blighting and wüheimg as 1
believe and feel them to be, upon these ¡ireat, essen-
tia!, and invaluable interests oí my oountiy.
Having now shown, Mr Chanman, the perni-
cious influence and effects ot these mstitu ions up-
on some of the greatest interests of the country, it
is almost needless to inquire, what mteresis are
benefited by them? That ihere ate a variety oí m
terests benefited by their operation , there can be
no doubt; to state them m detail would be a useless
consumption of time—they may all be included un-
der the head of the non productive ciusses,whe live and
enrich themselves, not by theirown labor, nor by ilv
cultivation and production of ihe sol—the owners of
foreign capi'al*m this ci untryare benefited byshpm
—(he great owners of capital in our own country
are benefited by them and above all, those are
mostly benefited who are invested with the privi-
lege of issuing paper, called money, to circulate
wnh interest, without capital, and who constituí 
emphatically (I had liked to have said the ennohkil)
but in truth, tha privileged classes ot the land.
Added to these are the whole surplus, idle, ftiatii-y
population of the country, which are mostly to be
found m your larger cities, m t very section of j our
nation, who are always resdy for any revolution
and change of ruler* in iV Go/ernment, so they
find ready employment in effec ing that change.
It was from this reason more tira any o her,
pThaps, that Mr. Jefferson was induced to say ih?t
he viewed your large cities "as cancer warts «¿on
the body politic,'''' and, sir, upon this subj 'ct Mr
Jefferson spoke with a prophelic tongue.    Such, in
* The foreign capital m this countiy at this time is estimated
by the Treasurer at 835,665,500    (See page 18 of the Keport)
truth and in fací, are the beneficiar es of thi> neat
banking system, that has outgrown the Constitution
itself in power.
But there is one ether View of these mstilut ons
to which I would call the particular attention ot the
committee and the country. 1 have of'en spoken,
sir, of the taxes which were levied on the people by
these institutions, and which were paid without a
murmur, while they raised their voices to the high-
est pitch against taxes paid to Government. I
have also spoken frequently of the aggregate losses
that had been sustained by the people from the
banks during the time that the "ftue and cty" was
set up against the Administrationfor extravagance,
&c. I then asserted that the people had sustained
a greater loss by the banks than by all other
sources known to ihe country I have asserted,
upon rough calculations, that the peop'e paid a
greater tax to the banks annually than they had to
then own Government. An 1, sir, what was then
assertion and calculation only, have now btcome
official facts, by estimation yet uneontroverted
Here is an exhibition of losses sustained by the
people from these institutions, as laid befora the
Senate on the 12th of Febiuaiy, 1841, by the
report to which I have just alluded, in obedience
to a call by that Dody on the Secretary of the
Treasury for information oí "the losseo by the Ge-
neral Government, and by the people of the United
States, from the use of t>anks and bank paper "
Here is the summary contained m that report of
the asgregate losses of the public, and the annual
auount paid by the people, by thepioductme classes,
emphatically, to the bank"; ot this country, to which
I invoke the sober and serious attention of every
man m the Republic, and particularly those who
live by labor or produt uve industry. I read from
the report, pages 14, 15, and   16.

Gallatin, m his Considerations on the Cuirency 3
# [The abot e amounts stated as the capital employed in bank-
ing íequire some explanion It has been the piactice inmost
parts of the country, to put banks into operation chiefly upon
the stock notes of the propuetors By the repoits of the Legis
lature of Massachusetts, in 183^, it appears that many of the
i    banks in that State, which are generally as safe as any m the
Union, have been put into operation upon the naked promls
soty notes of the stockholders, with little actual capital, except-
ing that which has accumulated from the operations of the
banks These promissoiy notes are the principal basis of the
papei curiency issued in the firs' instance If confidence should
happen to be buoyant for a succession of years, the interest on
this currency, paid in idvance, compounded as it always is at
short periods, soon enables the stock notes tobe withdiawn,
without the application of any capital whatever, by the ongi
nal stockholders On the other hand, should a previous gene
ial inflation give use to a demand for specie for exportation,
mtheeatly stages of any new bank, or where the stockholders
have applied the dividends to othei purposes, it explodes, and
the community generally lose thegieater partof the circulation
out at the time (See Raguet on Cuirency and Banking", p
115,Tuckei on Money, p 4(1°., Gouire on Banking, part 1st,
P  W)
But m these tables I am compelled to make the computation
as to capital as if it was all real and paid in, (so fai as returned
paid in,) on account of the difficulty m discriminating the
amount that is factitious from what is not so But I do not con-
sider any thmj as capital, which is merely authorized and not
returned as paid m 1
Estimated average bank capital, yearly, from 1830
to 1840                                            .                         «325,000,000
Estimated average discounts or loans, yearly, from
1830 to 1840                                                .               370,000,000
The loans have, in some years, been neaily double the
amount of the nominal capital in the whole Union Thus, m
1838 they were 180 per cpnl on it and in ten States exceeded
201 pel cent In scarcely any State is it believed that they are,
by law, limited below lhat rate, and sometimes they are limited
in their charters at only three times the amount of capital
(Gouge on Banking, pan 1st, p 51 )
As the income oi gross profits are derived, not only from
3 ansofthe capital, deposites, and circulation, over and above
the specie on hand, hut from exchanges, and a larger interest
than six pel cent m all cases, by the mode of computing and
paying it, (and in seveial states, from 7 to 9 per cent peimitted
by law) H is supposed that the annual gioss income must
average twelve pel cent on the capital Ihiswould be, as be
lore stated, m the last ten years, annually,              -   $28 200 000
Or, for the whole period,                              -               282 000,000
Now, by the evidence contained m this report,
there are two facts brought to light, which are as
astounding and startling as ihey are enormous in
their ma°nitude. In this Ihe gross amount lost by
the American people through 3 our banking sjstem,
is pscertained, 10 be, by the best estimation,
$365,451,497 More than half the amount known
to have been paid for the expenses 01 the Govern-
ment, sirce ihe foundation 1 f the Republic.
And, sir, within ihe last ten years, notwithstand-
ing the "hup and cry" raised against the expendi-
tures of the Government oí the people, thf people
have quietlv paid annually to these unproductive,
destructive institutions, $28 000,000, without a mur-
rnui,,it least frcm the friends of this system; a
sum m amount rne third more than they paid a<¡
the necessary expenses of the whole nauon, as ad-
ministered by the National Government, Yes, sir,
here are 28,000 000 of dollars annually paid to the
banks of the country by the people; ihe productive
classes chiefly, without a murmni, while they have
arraigned, tued, and condemned their o«n Govern-
ment for expending in lis operatirns an amount by
one-third lest, man Ihey have paid in taxes annu-
a ly to ti ose fleecing coiporations.
Now ran k be believed th?t ihe people have done
this knowing!}' Can it pt ssibly be pre umed, wi h
sucha krowledge, and such evidence before them,
they can or will decree, by their suffrage, the contw
uation of such a system' Will they ever assent to
pay to the suppoit of such a system, an amountby
one-thud more than they pay for the support of the
who!? of tne American army, navy, our civil and
diplomatic le'atioos. No, <-ir, no, sir, they may
suffer a temporary delusion, by their too confid-
ing dispjsitions in polmcans, and their credulity in
Ihe hired svborned, mercenary public presses of the
countiy^ that have tecome the mere agents—a part
and parcel of this great machinery in the system
I have de cubed, to keep up the delusion, whi'e
the  wrest from the hands of ihe poor laborers and
producers of my country, by extortion, yes, extor-
tion, the anpreceden'ed amount per annum of
$28,000.000.
Sir, ca  this Amencan people behold this
spectacle, wiihout deep indignation swelling
m thPii patriot c btsoms, that must burst wnh le-
vonge on Ihe headb ot those hireling agen's and
the.r cmplo}ers, who have so long combined to
rob them '{ their substance by clandestinely
wringing ftv.m ihem the hard-earned profits of their
ton, to the trormous -.mount per annum of $28,-
000,000'
Mr Chairman, can ihere be an occasion con-
ceived by a freeman, that calls more loudly for
revenge, revolution,   or blood?     Here is a syn-
