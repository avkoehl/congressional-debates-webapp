Interference in Elections—Mr. ftives.
SENATE.
populai mind, would often be tempted to abuse
them, and, unless restrained by law, to venture
on stietches of influence or authority which an
hereditai y magistrate, the constant object of pub-
he vigilance and jealousy, would be unwilling to
risk Accotdmgly,oneot the roost liberal as well
as piofound political wuteisof the age, one whom
hib own countiyman (Talleyrand) pionounced to
be a second Montesquieu, has lemarked in his
generally candid view of American institution" ,
that public officers here are ordinarily " far more
independent within then spheie of action than
the civil officers of his own country," and from
a reliance on the sympathy and indulgence of the
people, whose agents they are, they "sometimes
ventuie on manifestitions of their power, which
astonish even an Euiopean " " By this means,"
he adds, " habits are formed in the heart of a flee
countiy which may one day be fatal to its lib-
erties "
These remarks of De Tocqueville aie not made
with reference to the President particularly, but
are applied to American public officers in general
His book is by far the most favorable view of
American institutions that has been presented by
any foreign writer, and he holds them up, indeed,
for ímitationand gradual introduction into Europe,
a¡> far as the diffeient circumstances of the Old
and the New World will admit The remaik I
have quoted from him, theiefore, coming fiom so
enlightened and fuendly a source, deserves at
least the candid consideiation of eveiy man who
cheushes, and would pieserve and peifect, oui
fiee popular institutions It shows (hat we should
not be content with the fact, impoitant as that is,
that oui principal public officeis aie chosen by,
and aie, at fixed penods, íesponsible to, the
people, that eveiy circumstance may embolden
thenijfiom a reliance on the sympathies and pio-
tection of the people, to venture on unwairanta-
ble excesses The tiue security to fieedom is to
throw up, befoiehand, baruers by law against
the abuses of powei, though it be conferied by
the people, and then the responsibility of elective
agents will be something real and effectual " It
would be a dangeious delusion," Mi Jefferson
has told us, " were a confidence in the men of
our choice to silence our fears for the safety of
ourughts " "In questions of powei, then, let no
more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him
down fiom mischief by the chains of the Consti
tution "*
And yet how often has this siren song about
the men of our choice bten sung to lull the jeal
ousies of a fiee people, and to strengthen the arm
ot delegated power In this veiy teport of the
Senatoi fiom New Jeisey,the sympathies of the
people aie constantly invoked on behalf of the
office holders, (whose intei ference with their most
stcied lights is sought to be subjected to some
If gal lestiaint,) by being told, in not less than
haif a dozen doleful passages, that these poor
" pioscnbed officeis " are the people's officers—
" honoied by the choice of confidence of the peo-
ple'" In like manner, if a measure of the Pies-
ldent, deemed dangerous to the hbeities and best
mteiests of the countiy, is opposed, and opposed
with effect, the gcneious feelings of the people are
at once appealed to, to come forwaid and sustain
the Piesident of then choice
Fiom whatever cause it has ausen, whether
from that suggested by De Tocqueville, fiom the
operations of party discipline, fiom the political
organization of public officers, 01 from the pre-
rogatives conferred on the Piesident by the Con-
stitution itself, or fiom all combined, the tact is
undoubtedly true that Executive power has at
tamed a strength and development here which it
does not possess at this moment in any othei
constitutional system existing in the world In
England and in Fiance we know the Executive
veto has fallen into total uisuse Heie it has^be-
come an oidmaiy and habitual resoit In Eng
land and in I lance, if a measuie of the Executive
be defeated by the repiesentative blanch of the
Government, mimsteis iesign,and a new system
of administiation, accommodated to the views of
the Legislatuie, is formed Here a favorite meas-
ure of the Executive may have been condemned
* The celebiated Kentucky resolutions of 1798, drawn by
Wi Jeffei&oa
and rejected time after time, and yet it is again
and again presented and urged upon the Legisla-
ture and the nation without the slightest regard
to the repeated manifestations of the opinion of
the people and their representatives against it
And, in this veiy matter of elections, the most
vital in a free representative Government, the m
terfcrence of Executive officers (as was lately,
not to speak of other instances, most publicly
shown in the two largest cities of the Union) is
open, systematic, and undisguised On no sub-
ject is the spirit of liberty in England more jeal-
ously awake than on this Under the adminis-
tration of Lord North even, the lord lieutenant
of a county (an officer appointed by the Ciown)
having wntten letters to some of his friends rec-
ommending to them the spppoit of the minis-
terial candidate for Parliament, the matter was
promptly brought to the notice of the House of
Common* , and the minister showing some dis-
position to treat the subject rather lightly, the
House immediately enteied upon their Journals
the following indignant rebuke of the minister,
and noble vindication of the fieedom of elections
" Resolved, 1 hat it is highly criminal for any minister Or
ministers, or iny other servant of the Crown in Gr^at lint
iin, dnecUy or indirectly, to make use of the power of ins
í hice in order to influence the election oí member  of Par
liament -tnd that an itteinpt to exercise that influence is
an mack upon the digniiv the honor, and the mdepend
t nee of Parh tment, an infringement of the rights and the
liberties of the ptople and in dttempt to f>ap tne basis of
our free ind hippy Constitution "
And, yet, if a statement repeated thioughmany
of the public journals of the country, and nevei,
so far as I have seen, contradicted, is to be cied-
lted, a high executive officer of this Government
actively interfeied in an important election then
pending, by addiessing letteis to his fnends, call-
ing on them, by then fealty to the Administra
Hon, to vote against an honoiable membei of the
other House, [Mr Legvre,] who, by his short
butbulhant careei in Congiess, has left a bright
light on the parliamentary annals of his country,
and to whom future times will look back as the
model of an accomplished legislatoi, and of an
eloquent and trained statesman Let the doctrines
of the report now under consideration, amounting
as they do to a bold justification of these piac-
tices,be now sanctioned, and this Executive power
alieadyso foimidable, reinforced by the organ
ized electioneering activity of the whole corps of
office holders and of numerous auxihaiy troops
of expectants will be i nstalled in a vn tual suprem-
acy ovei the laws and Constitution of the coun-
try
The author of this report, Mr President, has
sacrilegiously, as he must pardon me for saying,
invoked the authority of the Vnginia resolutions
and leport of 1798 and 1799, and has, heie and
there, stiangely perverted then text, to give a
semblance of support to his most dangerous doc
trines Now, I take upon myself to say, theie
never weie two documents more thoroughly op-
posed, in their whole spirit and substance, than
tlnsrepoitof the Judiciary Committee of the Sen-
ate and the resolutions and report of the Virginia
Legislatuie in 1798-99
The object and entire drift of the Virginia re
poit and lesolutions were to assert the rights of
the people as against the Government 1 he whole
scope of the leport of the Judiciary Committee is
to maintain the alleged rights of the officers of
the Government as against the people The Vir-
ginia repoit and lesolutions asserted the right of
the people fitely to di&cuss and examine the mer-
its of public men and measuies, as the means of
subjecting the Goveinment to its just responsi
bility to the people This lepoit contends for
the ught of the officers of the Government to m-
teifeie with elections as a means by which the
people will be inevitably subjected to the undue
influence of the Goveinment
bo far fiom their being the slightest affinity be-
tween the doctrines of this lepoitand those of
theVuginia report and lesolutions of 1798 and
1799, the identity, on theotherhand.m principle
and aim, at least, between it and the sedition law,
is most striking and instiuctive The object of
the sedition law, as Mr Madison tells us in the
ever memorable report of 1799, was to " intrench
the Government in penal statutes," and so to con-
trol the fiee exercise of" theelectoial rights of the
people ' The pervading principle and drift of this
report is to " intrench the Government" in official
influence, and by that means to control the free
exercise of " the electoral rights of the people "
The Virginia opposition to the sedition law in
1798  and 1799, and the opposition we are now
making to the fatal doctrines of this report, in
like manner proceed, step by step, on the same
lofty and impregnable ground     In the report of
1799  Mr Madison, its author, emphatically de-
clared that " the right of electing the members of
the Government constitutes more particularly the
essence of a fiee and responsible Government,"
and it was to shield that " great remedial right
of the people" from the terrors of penal legisla-
tion that Virginia then interposed her solemn re-
monstrance It is from the same sacred appre-
ciation of this " inestimable right," and in order
to shield it from a still gi eater danger, the viola-
tion of official interference, that we are now strug-
gling against the alarming doctrines of this>report.
We shall heai no more then, I trust, Mr Presi-
dent, of the saculegious invocation of the Vir-
ginia principles of 1798 and 1799, to give a sanc-
tion to the bold and antL republican heresies of
the Senator fiom New Jersey and of the Judiciary
Committee, of which he is the organ
1 will now pioceed, Mi President, to say a word
oi two, and but a word or two, on the constitutional
power of Congiess to adopt some measure with a
view to lestrain the improper interference of Fed-
eral officeis with elections I am aware of the
difficulty of satisfactory legislation on such a sub-
ject, and that it would be a more appropriate mat-
ter foi Executive supervision If the Piesident
would reissue Mr Jefferson's cncular, prohibit-
ing the interference of Federal officeis in elections,
under pain of dismission from office, or would
carry out and enforce the punciple of that circu-
lar, I, for one, would be content But if he will
not do so, if, on the contiary, such practices are
tolerated, not to say encouiaged, is it not compe-
tent for Congress to give that principle the sanc-
tion and authority of law' My views would not
extend beyond that Cannot Congress, whose
power m the creation of public offices is undoubted,
also declaie on what conditions those offices shall
be held ' Can they not say by law, that if public
officeis, whose places are cieated by them, shall,
" contiary to the spirit of the Constitution and
then duties under it," (to use the language of Mr.
Jeffeison's circular,) interfere with the free exer-
cise of the electoial lights of the people, they shall
no longer hold their offices, but that such conduct
shall be deemed a forfeiture of them ' It seems
to me, sir, that there would be no stretch of power
in this
But the Senator from New Jersey, in his re-
port, tells us that "Congress have no right to in-
termeddle bylaw in prescribing the qualifications
of electors," that the Constitution of the United
States declares that members of the House of
Representatives " shall be chosen by the people
of the States who shall have the qualifications
íequisite for the electors of the most numerous
branch of the State Legislature," and, also that
electors of President and Vice President " shall
be appointed in such manner as the State Legis-
latuies may dnect," and that the right, therefore,
of prcsciibmg the qualifications of electors " be-
longs exclusively to the States, and is withheld
from the Federal Government " But what has
all this to do with the question ? Has any one
proposed to prescribe the qualifications of elec-
tors, or, in other words, to deprive office holders
of the right of voting' On the contrary, it is
conceded on all hands, according to the terms of
Mr Jefferson's cncular, that public officers are
not to be deprived of the right of voting, but the
ob|ectis merely to restrain them from interfering
with, or attempting to control or influence, the
free exercise of the right of voung by others
But the report again tells us that this cannot be
done without "abridging the fieedom of speech
and of the picss " What does this argument
amount to' That you can restrain no act, how-
evei dangeious to the peace, moiaN, or liberties
of the country, of which words, spoken or writ-
ten, may happen to be the vehicle or instrument
because, in restiaimng the act, you may incident-
ally put some restraint on the medium or instru-
ment thiough which the act is done. For exam-
