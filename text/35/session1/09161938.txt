THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 4,
reports, and joint resolutions, emanating from
either House, and*ordered to be printed, at such
"times, as the Secretary of the Senate or Clerk of
the House of Representatives shall require; and
the Public Printer, upon the order of the Superin-
tendent, is to be required to work at night as well
as during the day, upon the public work, when
the exigencies of- the public service require it.
When any document shall be ordered to be printed
by both Houses of Congress, the entire printing
of such document is to be done by the Printer of
that'House which first ordered the same; and
â– whenever the same person or the same firm shall
be Printer for both Houses of Congress, and both
.Houses shall order the same document to be
printed, composition is not to be charged but once
for that document, unless, from the length of time
between the several orders, recomposition may be
rendered necessary, and has been actually per-
formed;- and no sum is to be paid to the Printer
for altering the headings from the form in which
he printed them first to the form or forms in which
such documents shall afterwards he printed.
The ninth section provides that it shall not be
lawful for theliead of any department of the Gov-
ernment, or any officer or agent thereof, to print
or cause to be printed, at the public expense, any
report he has made, or may make, to the President
of the United States, to the head of any of the
Departments, or to Congress; or to have engraved
or printed, at the public expense, any map, chart,
diagram, view, 01- other illustration intended to ac-
company the same, unless an appropriation shall
have been previously made for such printing and
engraving; and no appropriation made for any
other purpose, nor any part thereof, shall be trans-
ferred or used for such engraving or printing, un-
less specifically authorized by law.
Provision is then made for the election by the
respective Committees on Printing of each House
of Congress, of a binder or binders to do the bind-
ing of all extra numbers of such documents as
shall be ordered by either House of the Congress
for which he or they may be elected; and the extra
numbers of all documents ordered by either House
of Congress, the size of which shall not bo less
than two hundred and fifty pages, are to be plainly
and substantially bound" in such manner as may
be directed by the Superintendent under the direc-
tion of the respective Committees on Printing of
each House, at a cost not exceeding twelve and a
half cents per volume, if printed in octavo form,
and at a cost not exceeding fifty cents per volume,
if printed in quarto form. The binder is to give
bonds, with good security, to the satisfaction of
the respective Committees on Printing, to execute
all binding which may be delivered to him, with
all proper despatch, and in strict conformity with
the samples or stylos which" may be adopted.
"Whenever any such binding shall have been ex-
ecuted by the binder, the manner in which he shall
dispose of it is prescribed.
Whenever any charts, maps, diagrams, views,
or other engravings, accompany any document
ordered to be printed by either House of Con-
gress, the Superintendent of the Public Printing
will first examine the same, and report to the
Committee on Printing of the Senate, if the docu-
ment is ordered by that body, or to the Commit-
tee on Engraving of the House, if by that body,
or to both, acting as a joint committee, if the doc-
ument is ordered to be punted by both Houses,
whether, in his opinion, the engraving and print-
ing of such illustrations are necessary, and the
manner and style in which the same uhould be
executed; and if the committee or committees
shall agree to print them, the Superintendent is to
advertise in such paper or papers, and for such
time as maybe directed by the committee, for
proposals for the execution of the work, and it
will be awarded to the lowest bidder, if the per-
son making the proposal is a practical engraver
or lithographer, and in every respect qualified to
execute the bids. He is to enter into bonds with
good security, to be approved by the committee,
to execute the work in strict accordance with the
bids, and within such time as shall be required
for the public service, and in the best manner, and
to make faithful return of all public property in-
trusted to his charge. The Superintendent will
furnish all the paper required for the execution of
the printing of all such engravings; but in default
of any contractor to execute all such work in strict
accordance with the provisions of his contract,
and to the satisfaction of the Superintendent, the
proper committee of the House ordering the work
will have power to #mul such contract, and cause
the securities on the bond of such contractor to
be prosecuted by the Solicitor of the Treasury of
the United States in the circuit court of the Uni-
ted States in the district in which the contractor
res.ides, for any damage or loss accruing to the
United States from the non-fulfillment of any such
contract. And if, during the recess of Congress,
any charts,maps,views,diagrams,orother illus-
trations are sent to the Superintendent, which, in
his opinion, are necessary to the proper under-
standing of any work previously ordered to be
printed by either House of Congress, or which,
by being engraved and printed in advance for the
illustration of any document which is regularly
ordered to be printed at each session, will mate-
rially expedite the completion of any such work,
he will spread the facts in full upon his record,
and proceed to procure the engraving and print-
ing of such illustrations by public advertisement,
and open all such proposals as may be received
in the presence of the Secretary of the Senate, the
Clerk of the House of Representatives, and the
clerk of the Committee on Printing, or any two
of them, whose duty it shall be to attend, upon
notification by the Superintendent, for this pur-
pose ; and the Superintendent will award the con-
tract for engraving and printing all such illustra-
tions in the same manner and under the same
restrictions as are before provided for by the re-
spective committees during the sessions of Con-
gress; and at the session of Congress immediately
succeeding such recess the Superintendent is to
report in full to the proper committee his action
in these matters, for their consideration and ap-
proval .
Whenever any account for any engraving or
printing of any illustration shall be presented to
the Secretary of the Senate or Clerk of the House
for payment, it must be accompanied by the cer-
tificate of the Superintendentthat the work charged
for has bee"h executed to his satisfaction, upon the
paper furnished by him, and has been leceived
by him; that the price is the same allowed by the
proper committee of the House ordcringthe same;
and that all the engraving and printing charged
for has been executed within proper time; and no
account for any such engraving or printing will
be paid by the Secretary or Clerk unless accom-
panied by the certificate of the Superintendentthat
the prescribed requirements have been complied
with.
The Superintendent is to keep a strict account
of all maps, chaits, views, or other illustrations
of any work ordered to bo executed; file all bids
for the execution of them; enter the name of each
bidder whose proposals shall bo accepted, the
amount allowed by the committee for the work;
the time within which it is required to be exe-
cuted; and when the work has been received and
accepted by him, he will also enter the date and
amount of the account presented by any such en-
graver or printer, which must be certified by the
Superintendent.
The Superintendent is to advertise annually in
one or more newspapers of general circulation m
the cities of Boston, New Yoik, Philadelphia,
Baltimore, and Washington, for the space of sixty
days prio. to the 1st of December, for sealed pro-
posals to furnish the Government of the United
States oil paper which may be necessary for the
execution of the public printing or engraving, of
quality and *n quantity to be specified in the ad-
vertisement, from year to year; open such pro-
posals as may be made in the presence of the
Joint Committee on Printing,on thefirstTuesday
after the first Monday of December annually, or
as soon thereafter as the joint committee shall be
appointed^ and award the contract for furnishing
all the paper, or such class thereof as may be bid
for, to the lowest bidder, whose sample, accom-
panying his bid, shall most nearly approximate
to the quality of paper (size, weight, and texture
all considered) advertised for. The sample oifered
with the bid accepted is to be preserved by the
Superintendent, and it will be his duty to compare
these with the paper furnished by the public con-
tractor; and he will not accept any paper from the
contractor or contractors which does not conform
to the accepted samples. The Superintendent of
the Public Printing is to deliver the paper for the
printing or engraving of the United States upon
the requisition of the Public Printer or engraver,
ami to charge him therewith; and as the printing
or engraving is returned, and passed by the Su-
perintendent, he is to credit the Public Printer or
engraver with the quantity used in the public ser-
vice. It will also be the duty of the Superintend-
ent to have the requisitions of the Printer or eel-
graver,^ and the returns of paper by the Printeror
engraver, balanced at least once in each year, or
oftener, if, in the opinion of the Superintendent,
it may be necessary; and in default thereof, to re-
port the same to Congress for such proceedings
as Congress may direct. In default of any con-
tractor, under this law, to comply with his con-
tract in furnishing the paper in proper time and
of proper quality, the Superintendent is author-
ized to enter into a new contract, under the sanc-
tion of the Joint Committee on Printing, with the
lowest and best bidder for the interests of the Gov-
ernment amongst those whose proposals were re-
jected at the last annual letting, if it be practicable
to do so, and if not, then to advertise for propo-
sals, and award the contract to the lowest and best
bidder; and during any interval which is thus
created by the new advertisement for such pro-
posals the Superintendent will have power to pur-
chase in the open market all such paper as may
be necessary for the public service at the lowest
price. For any increase of cost to the Govern-
ment in procuring a supply of paper for the use
of the Government, the contractor in default and
his securities will be charged with and held re-
sponsible for the same, and be prosecuted upon
their bond by the Solicitor of the Treasury, m the
name of the United States, in the circuitcourt of
the United States in the district in which the de-
faulting contractor resides; and to enable the So-
licitor to do so the Superintendent will report to
him the default on its happening, with a full state-
ment of all the facts in the case.
Provision is made for the appointment of a com-
mutee consisting of three members of the Senate,
and three members of the House of Representa-
tives, to be called the Joint Committee on the Pub-
lic Printing, to whom are to be referred all mo-
tions to print extra copies of documents or other
matter for distribution; and it will be their duty,
if they deem the printing of such extra copies
necessary and proper, to report by bill or joint
resolution authorizing the same, together with an
estimate of the entire cost of the work for print-
ing, paper, engraving, and binding, in detail; and
no document, report, or other rnattei, will be or-
dered to be printed by either House of Congress
until all the manuscript, together with the original
diawings intended to illustrate the same, shall have
been completed and ready for engraving and print-
ing. And neither House of Congress, nor any
Department of the Government, is to have power
out of its contingent fund to order the payment
of the whole cost, or any part of the cost of any
public printing of that class which it is enacted shall
only be printed by joint resolution or act of Con-
gress; but this act is not intended to prevent either
House of Congress from ordering the printing of
extra copies of any document, report, or other mat-
ter,for distribution, when the number of pages do
not exceed two hundred and fifty. The Joint Com-
mittee on Printing is to exercise a general supervi-
sory control, under this law, over the Superintend-
ent of the Public Printing; to adopt such rules as
sional binding; and to have power to examine the
j books, files, and accounts of the Superintendent, at
| such times as they may deem requisite and proper
1 They are to decide between the Public Printers,
binders, and engravers, and the Superintendent,
upon a written appeal or exception taken by them
or either of them from any decision of the Super-
intendent; and upon a written request of the Su-
perintendentare to construe any of the provisions
of this law, which construction, made in writing
and entered at large upon their minutes, shall
have full force and effect as the true intent and
meaning of the law. It is further made the duty
of the Superintendent of the Public Printing, 011
the first day of the meeting of each session of Con-
gress, 01* as soon thereafter as may be, to report
to Congress the exact condition of the public
printing, binding, and engraving; the amount and
cost of all such printing, binding, and engraving;
the amount and cost of all paper purchased for the
