Honorable E. M. STANTON:

To enable us to determine the number of men to be drafted in this State it is necessary that we should know the excess of men furnished by this State over and above its propitiation. We could do this if we had the actual number of three-years" men called into service prior to July 2. That number is variously estimated from 500,000 to 700,000 Indiana furnished under that call over 55,000, as shown by the statement of the adjutant-general, filed in your Department, and made up from the rolls in his office. If three-months" men, under the first call, she furnished 4,698, and in June she furnished 4,140 men, for thirty, sixty, and ninety days. What credit is to be made for these men, sent out in June and July? If under the first call 500,000 men were actually called out, the quota of Indiana under that call would be 29,125. This calcutalition takes the free States and the free persons in Delaware, Kentucky, maryland, Missouri,a nd one-third of Virginia as the basis. If the number was 600,000, then the quota of Indiana would be 34,950. If 700,000, if would be 40,775, in addition to the quota under that call. I desire to know what credit will be allowed for the 4,140 men called out in June and July, as above stated. It is further necessary to know the number of men now required to fill up the old regiments. A number of those regiment have ben filled; others are partially supplied, and the number yet required is not known here. As long as volunteers were called for we were unwilling to consider quotas, and desired no limit but our capacity to furnish men; but the idea of drafting is offensive to our people, and should not be extended so as to require us to furnish more than our proportion of the whole number called for under the several calls. It is not the fault of our people that the old regiments are not all full. Every regiment is full that had recruiting officers here for the past three weeks.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

A mistake certainly exists in the number required to fill up our old regiments; 10,000 are more than will be required. Less than twenty regiments have detailed recruiting officers, but these have succeeded soon. Had the details been made the regiments would now be full.

I will be compelled to postpone the draft beyond September 3 because I have not yet full returns of volunteers enlisted before the
