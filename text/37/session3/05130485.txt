Tteasurv which, 1 understood, had been read by
some ni'Miihets of tho House under the implosion
thai it was a recent letter referring to the bill from
the committee now before the House, and my ob-
ject was to coneet that impression. 1 have the
letter, and I ask that U be read.

With gieat respect, youi.-, Sec.,

Mr. STEVENS. Thatletter. if 1 recollect, does
not ief'T to 11!i v of the bills now before the House.
Mr. HOOPER. Itaceompanicd the hill which
the Secretary went to the Committee of Ways and
Means.
Mr. STEVEN'S. A bill which the committee
rejected.
'Mr. HOOPER. The letter was sent by tho
Secretai y, with a bill catefully prepaied, in reply^ _
to the request of the committee tor infoimation of j|
his views on the finances of the country and the i|
measures that ho would recommend 10 be adopted, p
It was iejected by the committee, as the chair- I1
man state*. I wjmi to call attention to this letter,
because I think it has been misunderstood, ami !
was supposed to lofer to tho present bill ot the ;;
committee. Tiie letter says that the bill embraced ■;
ins views as to the manner of providing; the ways
and me ins for carrying on the Government for
the current and PeMiiseai years. In the amend-
ment submitted by me. [ adopted the wonhnij of (j
that bill with very few modifications, patticuiariy |!
in legard to the iit\st hce'uon. _ j;
The Secii taiy calls attention to the provision |,
of his bill in respect to the lorni ot loan<: tli.it it -s
very i^enera!, i?iving the' p>>wei to iionow money ,
in anyof tiie ordmaiy forms authorized in pievi- ;
ous laws; or, if exigencies icqum , to make addi-
tional hsu< s of United States notes. ;
I have here the fiist section of that bill, and I ■
ask leave to read a portion of it in oider to show ;
that it was the opinion of to; Secretary that th^
amount of the ddTeient mnde> foi bun owin^shouhl
not, be presriihed, vid ' ia  the tir^t section of my
bill is in conformity v. i:h that oj-inion of the Sec- ;
reti-iiy. His bill lean.-* as tiulows:

autliori/.ed by acts of this Congre^^ h<vieroforc passed and
appioved, as', in his judgment, the public interests may re-
quire, nor other than such as have been heretofore sanc-
tioned by said acts.
During the reading of the above section, the
hammer fell, the ^emlemau from Massachusetts
having occupied five minutes.
Mr. OLIN. I hope the gentleman will be al-
lowed to go on.
Mr. KELLOGG, of Illinois. I shall have no
objection to the gentleman £oing on with his ar-
gument; but I do object to his road ins: to this
committee any communication from the Secretary
of the Treasury innny way, directly or indirectly,
as an authority and exposition as to our duties.
I should listen to the gentleman with as much
pleasure as any othei ^einleinan tu tins House;
but I object to dtscussmo- an authority deiived
from tiie Secretary of the Treasury.
iSo objection being made, the gentleman fiom
Massachusetts [Mi. Hooper] resumed his re-
marks.
Mr. HOOPER. My object in reading rhatpor-
tion of the Secretary's bill was to call the atten-
tion of the House m the fact that the authority
was let;uested by him in v very geneial way,and
to issue the obligations of theGovermncnt m such
forms as the exigencies of the public service may
require.
The letter goes on to say that he would cer-
tainly prefer a much more limited authority. In-
deed, he says, %t it would be highly gratifying to
me if the committee would determine not only m
what modes the whole amount shall be obtained,
but what proportion in the aggregate shall be ob-
tained in each mode."
I X wish to call the attention of the committee par-
] tieulaily to this pot tion of tins letter in which the
Secretary says he has given us his views, and that
the amount to be obtained m each of the modes or
ditleieiit forms of obligation to be issued i>y the
Tieasury should not be prescribed; but he says,
if the committee do not agiee with, hnn in t hat ie-
spect and choose to take upon themselves the re-
sponsibility of prescribing how much ofeach form
should be authorized, he would prefer to have
them do so.
JNTow, for one, 1 was unwilling to take that re-
sponsibility which the Secretai v hesitated to as-
sume. I objected to that portion of tiie eonimtttees
bill m wbichthey have taken tin; responsibility
of prescribing how much shall be, issued ot each
of the dillerent forms. They have pro\ ided that
£400,000.000 of inierest-beainiLi nolens, payable in
three yai.s, may be is.su<d,and tho.se notes are
ii made convertible at any time into legal tender
II notes. Now, I ask if it is rio-ht, when we have
jj authorized the1 issue of £400,000,1.100, convertible
lias I h rve stated, to limit the powei of the Secie-
tary to the issuing ol only $300,000,000 of the
notes into which they can be conveited r \i there
was any doubt whether the committee intended
to give tin1 Secretary, by implication, authority
m the bill as originally lepoited to issue an ad-
ditional amount for these conversions beyond
the s:)0t),000,1)00 directly authorized, niunk the
amendment of my friend from New York [All*
itoscoc Covkli.vg j sets tlicit doubt at rest
> and
strictly prohibits the Seeietary ot the Ireasury
from exceeding <300,000,000 ufle<inl tender note*.
Yet the hill authorizes the issue ot ^400,000,000
of notes convertible into these lejral tender notes,
of which there is to be only *,300,000,000 for that
purpose and for the pay of the Aurry and Navy
and oilier cied:t"is of the Government. J a;>k,
if that limitation to tJ.e is.-aie of legal teiidernotes
is preserved } what mai gin t here i« left to meet the
expenunnres for the Ai my and Navy i If the ie^al
tender notes should be requiied for those conver-
sions, what is there left to issue to meet the exi-_
^eneies of the public service for tho pa} ment of
the Army and Navy and other eicditors of the.
Government? it seems to mc there is an incon-
sistency in 11 to bill, so far as lUiuthorizes the issue
of on!y" "*300,000,000 and dispo.v s of four, five, or
six huntil ed nntuons under possible contingencies,
J wish to say a word in leferonce to the idea
that the House have not suiTicient confidence to
authorize the Secretaiy, sf the exigencies of the
public service shall require it, to boirow the
, amount in such forms as he may deem most for
j the public interest; for that is the amount of the
, allegation made as an objection to the authority
' being given to the Secretary to determine the form
of issues. The great inflation and depreciation
of the currency by the issue of paper money is
not a new idea. The State banks have always
possessed that power. No complaint was made
against their power to depreciate the currency by
over-issues of their notes for circulation. 1 be-
lieve myself it will be unnecessary, under any
probable circumstances, to issue more than three
or four hundred millions of the legal tender notes,
and that the power to issue a larger amount will
be all-sufficient. If the bill of the Committee of
Ways and Means is adopted, in which theamount
of these notes is prescribed, the Secretary has not
the power to perform the condition of converting
$400,000,000 of Treasury notes; there is dan-
<>er that there may be, at some time, a panic or a
run upon theTrcasury. Knowing that the Secre-
tary has not more than one half of the amount
necessary for that purpose, every man may be
trying to get first to the Treasury to get his notes
converted. 1 say the bill is not perfect without
giving the power to issue an amountoflegal tender
notec, at least equal to the power of conversion
which you have gtven to the notes issued on time.
When the hill submitted by the Secretary was
rejected by the Committee of Ways and Means,
my friend, the chairman, [Mr. Stevens,] turned
it over to me as the only friend it had m thecom-
mtttee. I considered and studied it with care
and prepared a new bill, making the bill submit-
ted by the Secretary the basis of it. In prepar-
ing it, 1 was greatly assisted by our chairman,
the gentleman from Pennsylvania, {Mr. Stevens
who kindly loaned me. the manuscript of his own
bill for thai purpose, and that will account forthe
resemblance he discovered the other day to his
own bill which he had olTercd as an amendment.
I was also indebted to niy friend from New
York, [Mr. Spat i.nis'g,] and appropriated a sec-
tion which he had jnepared with great care. I
adopted also a section of a bill sent to the com-
mittee by a distinguished financier and banker of
New York, who represents the knowledge accu-
mulated during two generations applied to the sub-
ject of finances. 1 i efer to .Tames Gallatin, Lsq.,
"son of the distinguished statesman and financier
of former days. I believe there is no part of this
bill, which \ have submitted as an amendment, I
can strictly call my own. It is mainly the bill
submitted by the ' Secretm y to the committee,
upon which I have lngiafted m part the viewsof
the chairman of the Ways and Means, and a
section prepared by my colleague upon the com-
mittee, [Mr. Spaulding,] and another section
from the bill sent to the committee by the dis-
tinguished banker in New York to whom 1 have
alluded. All the credit I can take to myself is in
the arrangement of it, which I hoped might har-
monize the views of the Secretary with those of
our chairman, of the other gentlemen on the com-
mittee, and of the bankers in Wall street.
And now, Mr. Chairman, 1 wish to refer for a
moment to tiie report in the Globe of the debate
which occurred on Friday last. I said then, in
reply to some question1* put to me by tho gentle-
man from New Yoik, [Mr. Roscoe Cokki.ing:]
<• I believe that tire bill reported In the Committee of
Wajy. ami Mean- is not ?ati-laetoiy to the SeeteUiy ol'tlre
Treaj-uiy. I have eon-ulled with huu tins mm inner, and
attei (louii? -^o I anaufxwl the Hilh^utute fot the amendment
ot the gentleman trom I'ennsylvaiiia, [Mt. Stevlns,] which
T have Mibmitted to the House.
Then: ate p.uM of the bill reported In the ronirnUtee
ofWaysand Means which seem to me to eonfliet mth the
j ecoriiiirctKiatioti'; ol lire fcsucietarv ot the J rca*au \ . T think
they would render the administration of In- l)ep u tsn-'i't tor
die ne\t tu elve month-* a mat"'i ot muiou- difficulty I and
I doubt very much whether it could be carried on under
that bill thiougli tin- >ear.'-
ln reply to further questions, 1 said:
'• J think that tt would be difficult, it not unpo^jble, for
the Trea-uiv Depattment to b" conduc ted under tliaf^bdl
tinou^h this. ear I have no authority to t-peak lor the Sec-
letarj*. but 1 am quite ceitaia that i-- his opu,ion.r
And I said further, in reply to another question:
fliave stated before that m> .-ub-ututc was p ep-ned
alter consultation with the Sectctaiv, and I undei-4ood
fioin him that Uie saibsutute would met t the wauls oi the
Tiea*ury I)epar trnent."
I call attention to this, sir, now, for the purpose
of saying' that 1 am not prepared to take back any
part of the statement which I then made. 1 do
not believe that the finance', of tlu- Government
can be administered during Ui-- ne.Mtwrlve months
under the bill as report.'.I b\ the e mmittee as it
is now. At least, I believe theie would be great
danger in undertaking to conduct the Treasury
