THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 2,
That question was yet to be tried in the House of
Represéntate es     He  would  not  anticipate the
issue     J t was not his business to do so    But what
had  the Senate done'   Had it ascertained the
truth" of the charges made by the Government
directois before they were rejected '   Not at all
Had they ascertained the truth of these charges
before they proposed to restore the public depos-
ites to the keeping of the bank ' Not at all < Noth-
ing is inquired into, nothing ascertained, all taken
fo° false, or frivolous, that is alleged against the
bank, and even hei cry adopted, of, Go to law '
Mr  B   remarked upon this cry for a scire facias
so suddenly adopted m the Senate here     It had
broke out to day, and now resounded from  all
quarters    Whence this cry >   It comes from Phil-
adelphia '   it is bi ought back by the minority of
the bank committee    It is put m their report, and
foithwith it becomes the ciy of the whole bank j
paity    But what a contradiction is exhibited, and ¡
exhibited here to oui faces'    What a change in a
few brief days'    For four months we heard noth-
ing else but of this responsible bank, subject to
the control of Congi ess' this creature of our own
creation, over which we had ample contiol'  Yes,
ample control' that was the word ' this fiscal agent, I
which was responsible to Congress, not to the
President1 and which was right in resisting all I
amenability to the President, because it was to
Congiess that the chartei  made it lesponsible1
This was the language, m this Senate, foi foui
months'    What is it now'   Why, that it is not |
Congiess, but the Judiciary, to which it is liable
It is thecouit—the court—to which it will submit   |
She will go to law with Congiess, but will not
Bubmit to be examined by acommittee     Congress i
may send a scuejacias, but no committee of mvea- I
ligation    Such is the new refuge, or subterfuge, j
ot the bank   When the Presidentasks foi informa-
tion through the Goveriment directors, his author-
lty is resisted, because the bank is lesponsible to
Congress, and not to lum'   When Congress-asks
the same information, then Congiess is resisted,
because the bank is responsible to the judiciary,
and not to Congress'    Such aie the contradic-
tions, such the subterfuges, such the tricks played
off in our faces, and in  the view of the whole
American people     In the face of such evidences
of gu.lt, in the case ot such a strong presumptive
case to convict the bank oí being the author of the
distresses which have been complained of in the
memorials to dngress, is it i lght to give her marks
of favoi and confluence' Is it right either to restoie
to hei the keeping oT the public moneys, 01 to
giant her a renewal of hei charter' Mr I> thought
not, and that the proper couise for the Senate to
follow was indicated in the resolution which he
had read, and which he would submit for the con-
sideration and action of the Senate, if the piesent
proceedings should be postponed
Mr CLAY asked the yeas and nays on the
motion, which were ordered, and are as follows,
to wit
YEAS—Messrs Benton, Brown, Forsyth,
Giundy, Hill, Kane, King of Alabama, Linn,

Robinson, Silsbee, Smith, Southard, S wift.Tipton,
Tomlmson, Tyler, Waggaman, Webster—29
So the motion to postpone was disagreed to
Mi BENTON then moved to strike out all after
the word íesolved, in the first resolution, and insert,
as an amendment, the bill reported in the House
of Representatives by the Committee of Ways and
Means, providing fot the deposite of the public
moneys in the State banks, and making regula-
tions for its security in those institutions
Mr   B   accompanied his motion by some re-
marks in support of the amendment, and was fol-
lowed by Mr CLAYTON, Mr WRIGHT, Mi
CLAY, and Mr SHEPLEY
Mi CLAY asked the yeas and nays on the
amendment, which wereordeied
Mr FORSYTH then moved an adjournment,
but withdrew it at the instance of
Mr TIPTON, who moved tnat the vote given
on Saturday, rejecting the bill for the relief of
Mountjoy Bayly, be reconsidered The motion
was laid on the table.
Mr FORSYTH then renewed the motion to
adjourn, which was disagreed to, on a division—
yeas 18, nays 23
After some further conversation, the question
was taken on the amendment, and decided as foi

Sprague, Swift, Tomlmson, Tipton, Tyler, Wag-
gaman, Webster—31
Mr BENTON then moved, with a view to test
the sense of the Senate directly upon the expedi-
ency of continuing the deposites in the State banks,
to commit the resolutions to the Committee on
Finance, with instructions to report an amendment
regulating the deposites of the public money in the
State banks
Mi CLAY asked the yeas and nays on the mo-

gum, Moore, Naudain, Poindexter, Portei, Pren-
iiss, Pieston, Robbins, Silsbee, Smith, Southard,
Sprague, Swift, Tomlmson, Tipton, Tyler, Wag-
gaman, Webster—32
Mr FORSYTH then moved to divide the ques-
tion on the resolutions, the two propositions being
different in their character, so that a dibtinct vote
might be taken on each
This, Mr CLAY assented to
Mr TORSYTH said, that as honorable gentle-
men had expressed a great willingness that a scire
Juaas, or other proceeding, should be instituted,
with a view to niqune into the proceedings of the
bank, and to ascertain whether it had violated its
chaUer, he would make a proposition, if he could
obtain any encouragement from the opposite side,
which should effect that object He pioposed to
oflei the following, as a substitute for the resolu
tions, to'follow the woid lisolved
"lliat a sene facias be issued by the proper
officei, to tty immediately if the charter of the
Bank of the United States has been foifeited
"1st Because the corpoiation has advanced
money to a foreign Government, without being
previously authorized to do so by act of Con-
gress
"2d. Because the whole power over the man-
agement of the institution has been placed, by res-
olution, in the bands of a few persons, and has
not been exercised by the board of directors as
requned by the ehaitei
"3d Because the bank has failed to perform its
duties under the pension laws, not having trans
muted money placed in its possession to pay pen-
sioners, when lequired by proper authonty
"4th Because the coipoiation has refused, un-
der various pretexts, to submit to an examination
of its books and proceedings, by a committee of
the House of Representatives of the United States,
specially appointed for that purpose
" 5th Because the money of the corporation
has been loaned to individuals and expended in
disseminating pamphlets and speeches throughout
the United States, to influence popular elections
and to procure a renewal of its charter
"6th and lastly. For any other causes operating
a forfeiture that can be established by evidence, in
the belief of the district attorney of the United
States, whose duty it is to issue the said sat e facias "
Mr CLAY and Mr CLAYTON each opposed
the proposition somewhat at length, chiefly be-
cause it was not distinct and substantive in its
character
Mr TORSYTH replied that he had not thought
of a distinct pioposition, but, if honorable gentle-
men desired the investigation, he thought they
ought to accede to this course If they would not
agree to it, he would not formally offer what he
•ploposed as a substitute
The resolutions were then sepaiated at Mr
Furstth's suggestion, and the question being
taken on each sepaiately,tbey ueie ordered to be
engrossed for a third reading, and, at half past
six o'clock,
The Senate adjourned
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Monday, June 2, 1834
After the Journal was read, Mr Speaker STE-
VENSON addressed the House as follows
Gentlemen I have attended in person to-dsy,
for the purpose of resigning, as 1 now do, the office
of Speaker of this House, with which I have been
honoied for the last seven years, and of announcing
to you the fact, that I have this day communicated
to the Executive of Virginia my resignation as.
one of the Representatives from that State in the
present Congress
The dissolution, perhaps forever, of the intimate
associations that have existed so long between us,
is calculated to excite sentiments of a painful char-
acter I feel it myself, deeply and unaffectedly,
and in quittirg a station in itself so honorable, one
so repeatedly.conferred on me and in a manner so
flattering, a station endeared to me by so many
consideiations of a piivate and a public nature, I
hope I may be pardoned in availing myself of this
fit occasion of taking my leave of it and of you, in
person, of offering my coidialand best wishes for
your individual prosperity and happiness, and
expressing publicly, and for the last time, my
grateful acknowledgments for the k.ndness and con-
fidence by which I have been so long distinguished
and honored Few, probably, that have ever
filled ttns chair, have enjoyed moie of this kindness
and favor than myself, none have received, or
will cherish it, with feelings of warmer or more
devoted gratitude My obligations, gentlemen,
aie indeed deep to this House, and go where I
may, or in whatever situation I may be placed, I
shall continue, to the last hour of my life, to pre-
set ve and cherish those sentiments of piofound
respect and affectionate gratitude, which yoiu
long continued and unchanging kindness have so
deeply impressed upon my heart, and which never
canbeimpaired Theduty ofpresidirgoveragreat
dehberativeassemblylike thisisno easy task The
high and distinguished character of such a trust,
and its arduous and important functions, cannot
fail to mspne any incumbent with a just distrust
ot his own abilities and qualifications, whatever
they may be
My administration of its duties for seven years
has not only taught me to know and fee! this, but
likewise to know how difficult, nay, impossible
it is for any man to fiee himself from error or
censure, in this chair, or give unqualified satisfac-
tion In times of piofound tianquillity and repose,
with united and harmonious councils, this has
rarely, if ever, been done Amid the strife and
storms of political and party excitements it would
be vain and hopeless to expect it My period of
service has, moreover,gentlemen, as many of you
know, been distinguished by events especially cal-
culated to render this station one of moie than
ordinary delicacy and embannssment, as well as
of increased responsibility and labor How assid-
uously I have struggled to discharge the duties of
this chair in a manner worthy of it and oimyselj,
with whatsincere zeal I have devoted my time and
my talents, and even my heal h, to your service,
I leave foi others to decide But this I hope I may
be pardoned for saying, m justice and fairness to
myself, and under a deep conviction of its truth,
that I have earnestly endeavored to discharge my
duty, not only with temper, justice, and modera-
tion, but with a just ¡egard for youi individual
nghjts and feelings, the charactei and dignity of
this House and my own honor This was all that I
promised when I came to this chair, and this I
have endeavored to do With what success, I
leave to you and to my country to determine
I am very sensible, gentlemen, that in such a
long course of public service, and in an independ-
ent discharge of the arduous and multifarious
duties of this chair, icgardless of whom it might
please oi displease, my conduct may sometimes
have been thought too harsh and rigorous, and I
may often, unintentionally have wounded the
feelings of individual membeis upon  this floor
