General GILLMORE:

I am in position and can retire at any time. Shall I retire by my right flank? I have two roads by this route which takes me by Howlett's. I think this is the route for me to take. Do you think the enemy are at Howlett's? Please send me at what hour I shall commence my movement.

Respectfully,

JNO. W. TURNER,
