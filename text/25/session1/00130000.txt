When the name of Mr. Cushino was called,
that gentleman rose in his place, and remarked,
that before he answered officially, he wished to say
a few words in explanation He saw before him
many members w ho were said to be elected to that
House, but that was all they knew, having, at pie-
sert, no authentic knowledge on the subject He
insisted that they were not members of the House
till after the election of Speaker, and they had all
duly qualmed He was a a are ihat the usage of
the House ha 1 been, that the Clerk should papare
a loll, as 1 e had done , should call the inemleis
individual'}', and that he should a'so offieia'e 111 the
organization of the House It was neifeetly propel
that he should do this, so fai asieganVd the prepara-
tion of the 1 oil and tne call of membeis, and toe stand-
ins; ru'e of the House provided that he should be C  r\
till a successor was aopomte 1 but it w as not pr p<
that that oincei shoul I be comreiM toreM.tto

It was not p^opei, Mr C must say, that thej, tin
membeis elect, should be organized under the pie-
cidency of an individual not a member of thur own
body. He did not sav this out of any want of cor -
fidence m that officer, v ho, he was assured, would
act m strict honor and good <aith, but h  desired to
avail himself of that occisun to p'Ote't against
the usage, <i ,d to°tate that, vit fot tne del cite en-
