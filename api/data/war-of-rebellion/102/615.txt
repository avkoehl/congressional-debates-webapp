MACON, May 26, 1865.

General DODGE,

Fort Leavenworth:

Governor Fletcher has ordered, through General Pratt, that calling out of a large militia force in Platte County and the adjacent country. From all I can learn, it is a premature movement, and which does not seem to be warranted by the facts in the case. Captain Shapley and the Order Numbers 3 men from Clay and Ray ought to be able to manage them.

W. T. CLARKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MACON, May 26, 1865.

Colonel A. F. DENNY,

Huntsville:

Take good care of your district. Order Truman to report to Colonel Barker at Saint Louis, and send Meredith here with his command with as little delay as possible.

By order of General Fisk:

The Thirteenth Missouri Cavalry, Colonel Catherwood commanding, is now en route for Lawrence, to go elsewhere. This regiment has not been paid for fourteenth months; many families of the men are suffering. Cannot they be paid before leaving Lawrence?

Major-General CURTIS,

If you think the reports about Hole-in-the-Day and other Chippewa chiefs reliable you had best apprehend them at once and keep them in confinement at Fort Snelling as hostages for the good behavior of their tribes.

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.
