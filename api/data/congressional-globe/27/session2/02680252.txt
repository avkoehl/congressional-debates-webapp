$iem in a train towards it—in that boasted year of retiench,
mem and reform on the part ofthosf-now so zealous m it, the
amount oftne estimate for the continent expenses of the House
was $250,000. It was now $150,000, being a reduction of
$100 G00 in tins single item
Mr. McKEONCMr F having yielded him thefloor)=-aid the
amount of estimates at that time was &250.0ÜG, and but
©200,000 were appropriated
Mr FILLMORE said it was so The Executive Department
that boasted of its reform, sent an estimate of &230,Qü0 This
Housejustabout toyieidus power, refused thisamaunt,and ap
propnated $200 Ü00 and they had now got n, down to $100 000
He believed that if they went on retrenching m this way, as he
trusted they would, a good dea! of prodigal expense would be
«i ved.
Mr. CARUTHERS said the House had adopted a resolution
providing that no appropriation snould be made unless autho
nzedby existing law He would inquire oí the chanmanof
the Committee of Wtlya and Means [Mr Tiltmore] wlie
ther there was any existing law authorising any ui these con
ttngeut appropriations'? II so, it was n it «eferied to in the
report
Mr. FILLMORE said, of course theie was no statute pre
scribing the amount of ih conuosem fund Thi^ appropua
tionwasameie incident of the powu" to preserve theaepajt
orient.
Mr. CARUTHERS continued If there was no law audio
r¡z ng it, could it be urged that ibeneces3aiy cnm.r^enf appio
pnations were an exception to the ¡evolution'* if so, ihe re^o
lution would be of no avail, fn an> ihmj could come m under
this idea of incidental expanse*

it was corrected That which was €alled the"Government was
a chaimedcircle, to enter which was too much an object of de

it was a disease that would destroy the healthy action of all our
institutions, unless it was speedily and effectually cured, and
he knew of no better or surer cure than that which he pro-
There wab nothing, he said, in all the machinery of our Go

fleeted back the character of the American people, or Ihe sub
etanual simphcuy of thea Republican institutions Let any
plain citizen, from any part of the couatij—no matter what
might be his situation m life—high or low, unconscious of the
fact, be transported into this Hall—would he believe himself
in the House where the Representatives ofihe American people
assembled to make their lawsi Let him look up to that loity
dome, w th all its architectural and sculptural garniture, and
gorgeous drapery, and instead of his being in a]iou*e for the
Representatives of the American peaple, he would suppose
himself m some ancient temple of the heathen gods, or some
enchanted castle told of in Arabian tales Nor that House and
Hall alone, but other places and other scenes—all and evry
thing connected with the administration of the Government of
the people, was unlike the people themselves, and not of them,
nor foi them, but seemed to him a¿e if it had all been got up,
and kept up for the people to gaze at with admiration, wonder,
an 1 awe, rather than to win thtir love and confidence by its
simplicity, utility and purity—its adaptation to meet their
wants, or to effectively execute thtín will Mi B said he was
no Goth oi Vandal—he did not wish to pull down any thing
that was really great or good, <trto see any thing connected
with the Govemment mean or grovelling, but all should be
plain, «ubstantiai, economical and useful, and all who cerved
theircountry should serve it asthey seive their fellow citizens
with fileiity and mdustiy, and should recene a just andfull
comnensation for ouch seivice.   No less—no more.
Besides this excess of compensation, he felt Kati«n>d, fiom
what observations he had been able to make, that there were
an exress of persons employed to do the public business This,
however, was not the place to consider tins branch of the
suhiect
This much he had thought it proper to say in repaid to the
mdttei of retrenchment and íefoim as it applied to the admi
lustration of the Government generally, as it related fo the sub

T! eie are matter's said Mr B connected with our expandí
tiues here which I am inclined to think, if the Comrmt*ee on
Retrenchment 1^ continuad, will be found io be unnecessary
Next, come candles and oil—over two thousand dollars    The
House must have had a great many night sessions to have con-
sumed so vasta quantity of oil and candles Here then was
extra clerk and messenger hire to an extiavagant extent, and hd
should vote to cut down that item of expenditure. This matter
of stationery alone was shamefully extravagant, and when we
talk, fsaid he, about reform, let us deprive ourselves
of these perquisites which cost so much money, and
which do not at ail promote the fublc service. The
clerks of the House, Mr B said, were paid too high.
For eight months' service m one year, and very little over
three m the other, they received higher compensations than any
officers similarly employed under the Government. And,
again, theie were more of them than m his opinion were neces-
sary Instead of dispensing with two of them, as proposed by
the resolution of ihe Committee on the Contingent Expenses, he
would vote to dispense with four or ñve 1 wenty thousand dol-
íais for messengers' It couid not be that all of them had been or
were necessary lor the legitimate business ofthe House Be
sides the contingent expenses of the House, he would obseive
that there were other of its expenditures that required reduc-
tion For instance, there was the mileage of membeis, m which
there was not only exti avagance, but injustice He had no
desire to quarrel with his filends who lived at a distance,
but he had no idea that men should make fortunes out of
the public in this way The man who labored for his daily
biead had to pay his part of all these extravagances, and it was the
misfoitune ofthe member^orthat Hoube, that while they were
surrounded with so much splendoi and magmfidence, they for-
got the poor men and the middle men of the country, who were
taxed on their food and clothing to pay for it While we, said
he, are giving two dollars a day to our pages, we should not
foi get that there are thousands of boys in the couatry who
would be glad toeain fifty cents a day for the support of a wi-
dowed mothei or a decrepid lather He fully appreciated the
meats of the boys here, he daily aiw their smiling faces, and
witnessed the zf al and assiduity with which they served him
and others, but he must not forget, m sympathy for them, the
# claims and merits of thou&andsof otheis equally deserving of
hisiegard Mi B said e\ery thing and every person, members,
c eiks, officers, messengers, pages, and contingencies, in and
about theHouse,and both Houses,were too costly, too expensive
The Speaker who occupied the Chair cost too much, the mem
bers themselves cost too much, alkali,every body and every thing
ought, in the present condition of the public Treasury, to be
made to feel Ufa contraction No feeling of sympathy /or per
sonal or political fnends mor out of office, no personal ease or
luxury bhouid make them forget their duty to their constitu-
ents, who weie not there to plead for themselves All the mo-
ney they wanted for these objects would have to be drawn
from the wealth or labor of the people them^elve^, and much of
