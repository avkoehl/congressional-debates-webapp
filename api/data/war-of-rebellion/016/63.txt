Numbers 36. HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF VIRGINIA, August 24, 1862-5 a. m.

Major-General SIGEL,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

The advance division of McDowell's corps occupied Warrenton last night without opposition. The head of this column was pushed just outside of town, on the road to Sulphur Springs, ready to move forward to that point should it be necessary. I am pushing a reconnaissance toward Waterloo Bridge to see what is there. Communicate fully to me through Captain Merrill, who will hand you this note, the condition of things in front of you. Our work must be finished here to-day; we have no time to spare. Provisions will be in Warrenton this morning.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General.

Numbers 37. [Extract.-Received August 24, 1862.] UNITED STATES MILITARY TELEGRAPH.

Major-General POPE:

* * * Thirty thousand troops or more demand transportation. It

is clear that the sudden demands exceed the capacity of the road. We can mange 12,000 troops per day, with supplies, if no accident occurs. The new troops might march, the veterans go in cars, horses driven, baggage, tents, &c., wait until they can be forwarded. Supplies takes precedence.

HAUPT.

Numbers 39. HEADQUARTERS FIRST CORPS, Near Waterloo Bridge, August 25, 1862-1.40 p. m.

Colonel GEORGE D. RUGGLES,

Chief of Staff:

Colonel Beardsley reports the enemy's cavalry at Sulphur Springs and the village occupied by the enemy's infantry.

Colonel Beardsley had been sent by me to Sulphur Springs with some cavalry and mountain howitzers. The main force of the enemy is advancing on this place (Waterloo Bridge).

General Reno should send me the 20-ponder Parrotts. I could use them here excellently.

I am, colonel, very respectfully,

F. SIGEL,

Major-General, Commanding First Corps.
