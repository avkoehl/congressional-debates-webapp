All discharged their duty.

Major General Samuel Jones,

Commanding Dept. of Western Virginia and East Tennessee:

GENERAL: I have the honor to hand annexed copy of Captain J. Wade's (assistant commissary of subsistence) report of our losses sustained at Salem by the late raid of the Yankee forces under command of General Averell.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. KING,

Major, and Commissary of Subsistence.

COMMISSARY'S OFFICE,

Salem, Va., December 30, 1863.

DEAR SIR: Below please find the statement of losses in this department by the late raid of the enemy upon this point:

Salted pork ....................................pounds.. 50,000

Flour ..........................................barrels. 143

Rice ...........................................pounds.. 2,400

Sugar ............................................do.... 1,900

Candles ..........................................do.... 225

Soap .............................................do.... 70

Wheat ..........................................bushels. 150

Lard ...........................................barrels. 21

Corn ...........................................bushels. 130

There were about 400 sacks of salt burned. This will not be a total loss, as the greater portion of it has been saved and can be sold at more than it cost. Also a lot of flour barrels, number unknown, as some have been shipped to different points, for which I have no returns, not can I ascertain until I make up my return of commissary property. Also, 1,350 empty sacks.

The above amounts are not exact, but they are as near the true amount as I can get until my reports are made up.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES WADE,

Captain, and Assistant Commissary of Subsistence.

Major H. W. King,

Commissary of Subsistence.
