CITY POINT, VA., August 11, 1864.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

Has any discovery been made of the points where the enemy seem to be mining? If it can be ascertained nearly where they are running their minis I think it would be well to let them run on without countermining, in hopes of having them attack us, being careful, however, to have at such places a second line in which to keep our men and to establish batteries to sweep any breach that might be made by their explosion.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I am not aware that the enemy's mining operations are positively known at any point.

The arrangements referred to by you of a second line, &c., were at that time made by him.
