HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 30, 1864 - 6.20 p. m.

Major-General WARREN:

The commanding general directs me to inform you that General Burnside reports that he has connected with you twice to-day, and each time you have moved off your right without notice to him. The commanding general desires you to keep the commander of the corps with which your flank connected advised of of your intention to change position so that the connections may be continued. The two brigades from General Burnside are reported by the staff to have left him at 4.50 and not 5.20 to join you.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864.

General WARREN:

I am ordered to send you re-enforcements. Where shall I send them? If Griffin would fall back and connect with our left, would you not be all right?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

MAY 30, 1864 - 6.15 p. m.

General BURNSIDE:

I wish you would send a force to take General Griffin's place, and let him move to my left, or send re-enforcements to my line about the point where the enemy's battery now is firing. I am not pressed now, but support to be of any use must come soon. I have sent an officer to your left to find you or any division commander there, with an order from General Meade for re-enforcements from you, with which he wishes us to attack the enemy.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 6.30 p. m.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
