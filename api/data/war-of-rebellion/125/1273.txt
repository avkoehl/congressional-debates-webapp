machinery fully at work) was the only possible way of quickly filling the quota.

It must be recollected that every step I have taken has been combated covertly, but most earnestly, by Mr. Blunt and the people at large. Every obstacle has been thrown in my way. Money has been refused by merchants and bankers, and even when they have placed it in the hands of Mr. B.'s committee the district provost-marshals have in many cases been unable to procure it.

Since April 1 I have lost at least 600 men from want of funds to pay bounties. I had broken down Mr. Blunt's committee and transferred its assumed powers to the U. S. officers, where they properly belonged, before the receipt of the order stopping recruiting and drafting. The citizens of New York, without distinction of party or condition, show the most urelanting and unreasoning hostility to the filling of this quota by any means. They pretend the believe they were cheated in the assignment, and men otherwise of intelligence and character evince on this point an amount of ignorance and obstinacy little short of insanity. Favor has been shown them to such an extent that they believe they can secure any point by bullying, pertinacity, and the powerful influence of their daily press.

The stoppage of recruiting and drafting is looked upon as a special triumph of New York. Nearly all the other sub-districts of the loyal States have furnished the larger part of their quotas. New York alone derives great advantage from her hesitation and culpable delay.

In justice to other divisions, I think an exact statement of the condition of each sub-district at the time of receipt of the order should be made, and it should be understood that in case more troops are wanted they will be drawn from the sub-districts deficient under last call.

I respectfully invite attention to the accompanying statement of daily musters in this city and division since March 27, the date when the drafted men were ordered to report.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICHARD I. DODGE,

Bvt. Lieutenant Colonel, U. S. Army, Actg. Asst. Prov. Mar. General

Men were lost nearly every day, the supply of funds being insufficient. Last two days very short, almost all the recruits being substitutes.
