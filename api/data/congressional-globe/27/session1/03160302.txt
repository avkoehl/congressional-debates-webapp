of '37, they would cut off every wiáow and orphan
now on the pension list, and leave none except the
seamen, officers, and marines, entitled to pensions
nader the ¿ct of 1800
Mr WILLlAMb aid the Senator was entirely
mistaken, and read the law of 1813, which was
still in lull force, and could not be affected
by the repeal of the law of 1837. The law
of 1813 gives a pension to the widows
and orphans of all who are killed in bat le, or who
die from wounds received in battle, and al«o gives
pensions to those who are disabled while in the
line of their duty. This law was now m force.
The additional provision' of the law of 1837, were
to carry back the pensions to the time when the
disability was mcuri d, and to extend it to the wi-
dows and children of the e who died, no matter
from what cause, whi e they weie in the naval
service. Thus, if an officer or «eaman died from
intoxication, or even committed suride, his widow
received a pension for life, and his children receiv-
ed pensions until they were twenty-one years of
age.
Again: if an officer or "eaman received a wound
■which did not disable them, they continued ltt the
service, receiving their full pay for years When
they thought proper, they retired from the service,
and applied for a pension for disability, whiei, by
the law of 1837, they were authorized to have ear-
ned back to the ttm* th- disability was incurred,
though they ha 1, during ibe whole series of yeais
subsequent to lcceiving the disability, and prior to
the application for a pension, be n rec iving his
full pay as oih"ers or seassun It was to pre-
vent the continuance of such abuses, that the
amendment was offered
