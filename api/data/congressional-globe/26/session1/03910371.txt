contract    Now if the taU of complying  uh the request of
these meo w go on at their own risk was a contract, why
then the world ot reasonin? by which he arrives at the conclu
«on, I am utterly at a lost to conceive
When these laborers wereaurfiiredto go on, there was a dis-
tinct understanding lhat neither the President nor Secretary
wtre to be resnoisible for anv thing The laborers said they
would go on with the work solely on their own risk, and re
lying on an appropriation from C angress.
The gentleman haJ askeJ il H was an "honorable thing "
What' had the gentleman, too, become an advocate lor permit
ting an omt*r to pay money without an appropnauon by law?
Did the gentleman intend to say lhat the Secretary had a right
to pay debts without authority II so, there would be no
longer anv check, and the invaluable constitutional safeguard to
toe 1 raasury would be remove i
He would again say that he had not the slightest objection-
that every dollar earned bv these people should be paid, and
that a sufficient amount should be inserted in the bill to cover
their honest and hard earnings He would be the iast man on
that floor to object to it.
All he said was that there wa* no obligation to go beyond the
amount tor the payment ol these individuals. He was willing
to pay them to th<- last cent, if it took every dollar from the
Treasury But when we were told that there were no means to
eomplele these buildings, he did find tault with gentlemen who
wished the appropriations doubled
The gentleman from Massachusetts would not go through many
sectioua of the bill before he would find an item of 075,000 for
erecting a custom house in his own State, and perhaps this
«75 000 was but the entering wedge lor greater appropriations.
Mr J then adverted to the objection ol some ot the Opposi
tion to the small amount ol Treasury notes, or shinpUsters, as
the gentleman callón them, which ha 1 been required They
wished agreateramoun', aal it ten millions, in-nead of five,
had been granted, it would have pleased them better
Mr AD4.M4 wished to know why the gentleman had gone
out of his way to speak of the custom house at Boston, instead
of confining himself to an answer to the question propounded
Mr  A then intimated lhat Mr J   vas a little offended
Mr JONES No, the gentleman is mistaken 1 was never
■a a better temper in my life
Mr ADAMS wished to know whether the gentleman meant
when he had spoken of the "favorite institutions of the gentle
man "
Mr JONES said he referred to banks
Mr AD AMS begged to say that if the gentleman thought the
banks were his favorite institutions, he knew very little of his
opinions on the subject His opinions on that subject were no
secret, they were long since made known to the country Mr
A then spike at some length in lavorof the amendment
Mr HUNT spoke at some length in favor of the amendment
proposed Suppose, he said, the House pass the bill as re
parted trom the Committee of Ways and Means, what becomes
of the «53,000 due the workmen—money earned by the sw<.at
of the brow by the attificersand workmen on the public build-
ings! These workmen had been compelled to h >ld their certifi-
cates from October last, it they have not disposed of them to
furnish necessaries of life to their families, till the present time,
without one cent of interest Will this House, for the sake ot
the appearance of economy, do the crying injustice to these
men, by withholding the appropriation' He hoped
not. Suppose, instead of making provision in this
bill, the claims of these workmen should be referred to
the Committee of Claims, of which his honorable colleague
[Mr Russell] was chairman He had no doubt, strict and
rigid as that gentleman was in his investigation of claims, he
would forthwith ret>ort a bill far the appropriation of the full
amount due the hard working men to whom the Government
is now in debt Then why not put in this bill He did not un
demand that the chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means differed as to the {principle of payment, but in the terms
He called upon the gentlemen of the Administration to know
whether they would bo limit the appropriation in this bill, un
der the circumstances of the case, as te leave out the «53,000
dne these mechanics—an amount legitimately belonging to this
bill, and leave it to be he hereafter provided for by the Com-
mittee of Claims It would be doing crying injustice to these
meritorious men Mr H concluded by expressing a wish that
the debate would -not be extended, but that an appropriation in
proper amounts would be made
Mr LINCOLN said th*re was already 860,000 due these
workmen for labor performei The estimates furnished by
thearchitec called for an appropriation of  105,0n0, and there
was no good reason why it shoul 1 not be appropriated He in
quired ol the chairman whether it was proposed to limit the
appropnati n to the amoun1 due, and discontinue the work
Mr JONES said that the amount called for in the bill, was all
that itwasthojght the condiaons of the Treasury would war-
rant the expenditure of He thought it should be sufficient for
the present Mr J wa3 understood to say that the amount of
appropriation was proposed to b¿ limited to what was due the
workmen
Mr LINCOLN Then the building is to stop. Mr L then
•poke at some length to show the importance of further appro
priauoo, on the score of economy, to continue the buildings
The materia ! collected would be wasted if the appropnauon
was withheld It would be doing great immtic to the work
men to throw them off at this time, considering the circum
stances under which they were brought here
Mr SALTOMsTALL said if the question now was, whether
These buildings should be put up, then he might hesitate about
the appropriation His creed was, that when public buildings
were constructed, (hey should be of durable materials, and
built m such a manner as would be honorable to the nation It
was not a proper economy at all times to put up a building at
the smallest cost. He then spoke of the location of the pub
¿C ««"** now conatttcting, to which he objected The
Post Office building was being constructed with a beauty
of material which any cinz n of the country would feel a pride
and gratification to behold, but, from its location in a narrow
street, the whole effect is destroyed If these buildings were
abandoned in their unfinished state, the materials would remain
scattered and subject to waste and ruin, unless a large appro-
pnauon was made to gather them up and take care of them It
would be disgraceful to the nation to abandon the works in their
present condition, or to refuse to appropriate the amount of
money due to the workmen This Government was not so
bankrupt, he said, bmthat it could afford the appropriation pro
posed in the amendment if it was in lhat condition, It had bet
tír apply to ths circuit court, and take the benefit    Let the Go.
vemment do as an individual would do under similar circum
stances, to prevent the loss of property from the want of fur-
ther means to prevent it—laise the money on security oi mort
gage ot the property, or by the issue of more Treasury notes
But he had do doubt that there would be a sufficient balance left
unexpended of the amount of these notei sir ady issued to au-
thorize the House in making the appropriation
Mr MONROE advocated the amendment as a measure of
economy It the appropriation be withheld, and the workmen
stopped, the dilapidation of the building would be so great, and
the materials would be so scattered before it will be again
commenced, that it would cest double the amount then as is
now required to complete the building
Mr MARVIN said i( there was not a single gentleman op-
posed to the amendment, why not take the vote upon it If
geutlemen were prepared to stop the building, let them vote
against the amendment, and Tice Tersa True economy re
quire 1 that the appropriation should be made He, therefore,
hoped the question would be taken He had no doubt there
was not a man who did not pioperly understand the subject
Mr THOMPSON of South Carolina censured the course of
the Secretary of the Treasury for not recommeuding the
amount necessary to pay the workmen, for the labor already
performed on this building, and for continuing the construction
of the buildings I le advocated the appropriation of such an
amount as would continue the employment to the workmen,
and to the completion of these buildings. He would not send
them off now, when no lalior «ould be procured elsewhere, nor
would he wish to see the plighted faith of the Government vio-
lated by withholding the amount due these workmen fer the
labor already perf >rmed for the Government He was also op-
posed to saddling any future Administration with a debt in-
curred by the present
In the course of hisremarks,Mr T adverted toa censure he
had passed some time ago on the Repoiters of the Globe He
said he felt it his duty to admit that he had done the Re
porters injustice on the occasion, as he did not believe they
would, intentionally, misrepresent him
Mr PETRIKIN said he would ask the indulgence of the
committee for a few minutes, whilst he paid his respects to the
gentleman from South Carelma, [Mr Thompson,] who had just
spoken The gentleman (said Mr P ) has, according to his
usual practice, given us a speech, one half of it on things he
knows nothing about, and the other half about matters having
no relevancy to the subject before the committee, something
like a fish roe, thrown into a hot pan, jumping about,'snapping,
and cracking, and finally leaving neither foim nsr substance
The gentleman frem South Carolina had asserted that" every
patriot in the country was anxious to change the rulers of the
country " This asserUon, or rather denunciaUon, he (Mr P )
denied, and considered of a piece with many of the gentleman's
assertions, and the pretensions of many of his party to exclusive
" patriotism, decency, &c " Mr P thought if the gentle
man's patriotism was like some other matters he talked of
ten about, and he was to be the standard by which others
were to be j udged, there were but few patriots in the coun
try, and the sooner such patriots left the country, the bet-
tei Mr P believed, however, that there weie but few men in
the United States who were not patriots at heart, no matter
what political party they belonged to As to the amendment
now under consideration, it was approved of by a committee,
four of whom were Democrats, and one Whig, without dissent
It was prepared without regard to any man's previousopimons,
and sent to this House He (Mr P ) was one of them, and of
fered the amendment This committee acted as men of prin-
ciple^—never suffered pohucal prejudices to interfere with
their duty as men, in that committee room, when no party
principles were involved, but judged of things submitted to
them according to the facts, having due regard to doing justice
to the Government and te individuals He [Mr T ] accuses
the friends of the Administration in this House of sacrificing
their morals at the shrine of party. It comes with a bad
grace from the gentleman, or his party, to lecture this House
on morality A review of their actions, as legislators general-
ly, would prove this clearly
The discrepancy between the estimate of the amount in-
serted in the present bill as necessary to complete those pub-
lic buildings, and the sum found now to be necessary, is easily
accounted for The estimate in the bill was made in December
last, before the work was done The amendment now offered
is predicated on estimates of work principally done Mr P.
did not consider the President to blame in this matter He
had neither time nor inclination to attend to matters of this
kind , nor was Mr P prepard to blame the Secretary of the
Treasury He had to depend on the very uncertain informa
tion furnished by the architect, and every one knew how un-
certain such data generally was The gentleman had expressed
himself as horror-stricken that the President had given direc
tions to reduce the hours of work at the public buildings to ten
hours He has asserted that the President had directed this to
be done by proclamation
How did that gentleman ascertain this? Mr P would like
to know his authority Itwasthe duty of the Commissioner of
Public Buildings to make this matier public, and in discharge
of his duty he did publish it, for the information of the nume-
rous persons interested in a knowledge of it Was this a
criminal matier in the President? If Tie had not done it, he
would have been very properly denounced in this House.
Mr P said he would inform the gentleman from South Caro-
lina that it was a common thing In Pennsylvania, for those em-
ploying white men, to specify the hours for work When this
was not done to the satisfaction of the workmen, they called on
their employers and stated their grievances Mr P would in
form the gentleman from South Carolina, that the labor of the
Northern and Middle State was generally done by freemen,
who knew their rights, and were not afraid to assert them It
often happened that when those workmen suppose they are
aggrieved, they turn eut, and as they call it, and cease working
until they are satisfied They consider themselves at liberty
to work, or let it alone
The gentleman affects a great deal of sympathy for the starv-
ing condition of the mechanics and laboring classes of society
throughout the country generally He would (said Mr P ) take
the liberty of informing the gentleman that hissympathies were
misplaced, as to ihose men There was no one of those classes
suffering or starving, that would work, or had health It was a
fact that around the large manufacturing districts there was
some suffering, caused by the gross, dishonest conduct of the
gentleman's friends, the banks, butthe mass of the laboring class
were far from being in a suffering state All who would work
could get employment and fair wages    Mr  P   could speak
knowingly on this subject He was in ths habit of employing
a large number of workmen A year ago he paidlaborers from
*1 124 to 81 35 per day, when they had to pay for bsef from 8
to 10 cents par pound, for bacon from 16 to 19 cents per pound,
and for flour from 8 to 10 dollars per barrel Now laborers
were paid 87 J cents per day They bought their beef for from
4 to 6 cents 1 er pound, bacon from 7 to 12 cents per pound,
and flour $5 per barrel Now, said Mr P can the gentleman
from South Caiolma tell, by cyphering, which set ol prices is
the best for the laboring men! Mr P regretted to hear gentle
men dragging every subject that came before this House into
the arena of politics, no matier how foreign from the subject.
It did not say much for the morality of those doing so Mr P
went on to urge the adoption of the amendment as a benefit to
the public,by preserving the buildings, and rendering the records
now in it safe
The House again resolved itself into committee and re-
sumed the consideration ol the bill
The question being on the adoption of the amendment of Mr.
PüntiKíN, a count was taken by tellers, (Messrs Bnisos and
Chapman of Alabama a< ting as such,) who reported—ayes
8b noes 4J    So the amendment was agreed to
The clause appropriating $45,000 fin continuing the con-
struction of the new Patent Office building having been read,
Mr PETRIKIN moved to strike out «45,008, and to insert
"♦100,000 to complete the sail building, including for entire
occupancy, and for the portico."
Mr P said that this amount was in conformity with the esU-
mates of the Commissioner of Public Buildings    The build
ing would he damaged and ruined if the amount proposed was
■ot appropriated
After a lew remarks from Mr STANLY, the committee was
divided on the adoption of the amendment of Mr Petrikin,
and there being—ayesSB, noes 38, no quorum voung,
The committee rose, and the chairman reported that fact to
the House.
Mr LINCOLN moved a call of the House, and Messrs.
Griffith and Psopfit having been appointed tellers to ascer
tain whether there should be a call, reportad that then were—
ayes 90, noes 34.
A call was ordered, but there being «.quorum present, by uni-
veral consent, all further proceeding in ths call was dispensed
with, and
Mr LINCOLN moved to amend the amendment by (hiking
out «45,000, and inserting, after the word "dollars," the words,
"to complete the said building for entire occupancy, together
with the porueo," including arrearages of «42,000 due to the
workmen
Mr PETRIKIN accepted the above as a modification
of his.
After a few remarks from Messrs LINCOLN and PETRI-
KEN in favor of the amendment, and by Messrs PROFFIT,
JONES of Virginia, STANLY and BOND, in explanauonof
the expenditures of the building.
The question was taken, and the amendment was agreed to
Mr STANLY moved to strike out «155,000 for alterations
and repairs of the Capitol, and incidental expenses, etc , but
after a few explanatory remarks by Messrs JONES of Virginia,
and LINCOLN, the motion was withdrawn
Mr STANLY moved to strike ou t 81,200 salary to the princi-
pal officer, and Insert the sum of «1,000
Mr LINCOLN said he was opposed to the amendment The
salary of this officer was increased last session by the action of
both Houses of Congress, after the most mature consideration
This gentleman has the superintendence of the whole of the
public grounds, amounting to about one hundred acres He
was not as well paid as the common laborer under his charge,
considering the amount of his labors You cannot procure the
services of a compe-ent man any where He remains in the
service of the Government at a less amount than he could gst
elsewhere He could get more from any private gentleman
who was acquainted with his capacity to attend to their grounds,
if his services were needed He was actually astonished at the
quantity of grounds he had to attend, and the great amount of
labor he hecf to perform He referred gentlemen to the condi-
tion of the public grounds now as compared with its condiuon
before he was taken into the employ of the Government, asan
evidence of his merit.
Mr J W JONES said he was much in the situation of ths
chairman of the Committee on the Public Buildings When
Mr J came to look at the subject, he was much astonished on
becoming acquainted with the amount of business under the su
penntendent's charge The gentleman from Massachusetts
[Mr Lincoln] said that the superintendent had something like
one hundred acres nf public grounds under his superintendence,
and had shown that their condition was such as w satisfy every
one that the superintendent was a faitful agent Those mem
bers who were In Congress six years aeo would be surprised to
seethe state of the publi  grounds, compared with their former
condition Something like five acres was in shrubbery and or-
namental treeB, and kept in tke most beautiful condition The
superintendent had not less than five miles of walks to attend to,
besides the trimming of trees His attention was devoted to
all those services Gentlemen would find him to be a services
ble man
Mr STANLY made some remarks, m the course of which he
censured Mr Lincoln for testifying to the merits of the garden
er. He said Mr L made himself a >ack horse for all the
abuses of the Administration
Mr LINCOLN said it was his duty as chairman of the
Committee on the Public Buildings and Grounds (under whose
supervision the labors and duties of this gentleman came,) be
ing perfectly conversant with the subject, to testify to his quali-
fications He also felt it due, from ásense of propriety, anda
sense of justice to this individual, that he should give to the
committee the information he possessed
Mr STANLY again spoke
Mr LINCOLN thought it true economy to pay this individu-
al «1,300. He saves the Government, by his care and attention,
an amount equal to half his salary Sine  he had been in the
employment of the Government, he had cultivated a great
number of plants, and the Government had been put to very
little expense for shrubbery. He is a scientific gardener, and a
man of great skill Gentlemen in New York and Philadelphia
were anxious to get him out of the employment of the fao
vemment, and he had no doubt he would have gone if the
salary had not been increased last year He was in tavor 01
continuing the appropnauon, if it was not dons he had no
doubt that he would leave this city                 _.«j_.„i of Mr
«The quesuon was then taken on   the amendment of Mr
T A nly, and disagreed to without a count
