much under the power of the overgrown capitalist,
and the laborer as much at his mercy, as he is in
the old countries in Europe. Yes, sir, instead of
that equality which characterizes our people, we
shall have classes and divisions in our country—on
the one side overgrown wealth and influence, on the
other, poverty, ignorance, and, absolute dependence.
Cfive us manufactures in this country; give us
likewise a scattered agricultural people; and let us
have a commercial people; and let all these inter-
ests feel alike the blessings of government; and let
the great governing principle be, that no ene interest
is to be promoted at the expense of the other.
Much is said on the subject of high duties abroad
on American produce, yet I do not hear of any per-
son contending for retaliation in the laying of duties.
All agree that we should raise nothing more tlito
is necessary for the support of government; but we
differ in the mode of accomplishing this object.
But the fact is, that, at this very time, our duties are
higher than those of any other government that we
have any considerable trade with. I should like for
gentlemen to present a scale of duties of any gov-
ernment with Which we trade equal to the following,
under the act of 1842, that we are now considering:

Here is a very high duty on tobacco, yet will any
man contend that this duty is laid for protection? By
no means; it is laid to raise revenue. But look at
the duty laid on our tobacco in the Hanseatic cities,
as follows:

Yet, with this duty so low, in comparison with
the duty laid by the English government, let us look
at the sales of tobacco for four years past, by our
people, to these two governments, and from them
draw proper conclusions on this subject:

eeivert as respects the markets on the continent on t>ucli ad-
vice, the destination is changed. Tbereloie, all the tobacco
enteitd in our jioits, and clt:aied for Kngland, is not intend-
ed for consumption in the letter eonntrj.
I take the following from a New York paper of
yesterday. Connected as it is with the late foreign
news from France, it will be calculated to affect eve-
ry western pork packer; and it is only a commence-
ment of a series of retaliation that will be followed
by an adherence to our present high duties, and will
alfect e\ery western farmer:

the lowest point) which have prevented polk fiom being d

The principle of averages in the rates of duty is
frequently spoken of by those who advocate the
tariff bill of 1842. For example: the whole amount
of dutiable goods imported under this act, and the
amount of revenue collected on the same, is known;
and then, say gentlemen, this is not a very high tar-
iff, it is only thirty-six per cent, ad valorem. I wish
to look at this. There is the owner of a woollen
manufactory, who pays five per cent, duty upon the
dirty wool (not coarse wool, for it is often of fair
quality, but cheap because clogged with dirt) im-
ported from South America; his neighbor is a me
chantc, say a blacksmith; he pays about a hundred
per cent, upon the bar iron out of which he ham-
mers horse shoes for his customers. Now this
looks a little high, but we will average them, and
then say the duties are quite low. Let us follow
this a little further under the bill of 1842. The gold
chain is taxed 7 per cent.—the log-chain of the
farmer is taxed about one hundred and sixty per
cent.; the coarse flannel for shirts pays a duty of
fifty per cent., while the Cashmere and Thibet
shawls of great value pay but twenty per cent.; the
brass kettle pays fifty per cent., while the cham-
pagne pays ten cents per bottle: all of this is beauti-
fully reconciled. by the doctrine of averages* In the
same way they can reconcile the profits of the man-
ufacturers of from twenty to thirty per cent, on their
capital, while that of the farmer is short of 3 per
cent.; thfcy will just average the same bV saVing IS
per'cent; it is for the farmer to say how he likes this
new method of averaging.
And more than all this: an examination of the
tariff'bill of 1842 will show, that, for an equivalent
of taxing every article of prime necessity, with two or
three exceptions, the manufacturer receives his fus-
tic, logwood, madder, cochineal, and the most of
his articles, free of duty; and we, in return, have the
pleasure of paying a hundred per cent, duty upon
the smoothing iron used by our wives, and the arti-
cles of s&lt, sugar, iron, molasses, &c., are taxed to
more than sixty per cent. The brdad principle es-
tablished by the bdl of 1842 is clearly marked, that
the labor of this country shall support the government;
that the working millions of our land shall pay the mil-
lions into our national treasury, while^ to agreat extentf
the capital of this coxmtry, and the manufacturers, shall
go free. And the rfeturn that the laborer is to receive
for all this, is to be told that high duties make goods
cheaper, and he will have exhibited before him tables
showing the price of nails, glass, &c.5 for the last few
years. It is a pity that these men do not make out a
table showing the price of tea and some other articles.
I suppose the cause why it is not done, is, that
there is no duty on tea; if we had a high tax on tea,
we would then know how to account for its fall in
prices. Oh! shame!
I assume this position, that a 15 per cent, tariff
now, is more onerous in its bearing upon the people
than a 25 per cent, tariff was from 1833 to 1837, owing
to the change in the currency; and I think that this is
susceptible of the clearest demonstration. If we
look at the sudden rise of all descriptions of goods*
lands, and produce, from 1833 to 1837, almost dott*
ble the price from the article of cotton to the article
of wool, and had time to see its effects connected
as it was with the inflation of our currency, the im- *
portation of wheat in 1837, the price that the same
brought, the duty paid on the same, this would be
most manifest.
The duty acts as prohibition in one state of the
currency, but it never acts as a bounty or protection to
the foreigner. He comes in, not because of the
duty, but in spite of it, under an inflated currency.
He pays the duty, and the consumer pays it to him;
and lie receives the advanced price occasioned by the
inflation. The consumer pays that duty—but he
does more—he pays a similar price to the producer
of the home article. The difference is, that part of
the price of the foreign article goes into the treasury,
but none of the price of the home product.
It is one of the cases, too, where the consumer
pays the duty; and yet it comes out of the pocket of
the importer^ who would get the whole price if there
was no duty. 'This is the result of an inflated cur-
rency. It would be a good result much to be de-
sired if it were not true; 1st, that such an inflation in-
\ites foreign competition, and swtlls the supply
frequently beyond the demand; 2d, that it occasions
a dram of specie, because our commodities cannot
be bought at ourpriccs and sold in the foreign country
at sound currency priccs. The result of which is a
revulsion. The inns on the banks take place; sus-
pension followsfa debt is left against the country, to
be slowly paid by the sluggish sales of our staple
commodities to pay off old balances, and prosperity
only returns with an equalized currency which pro-
duces a healthy trade.
But to show the effect of the currency upon the
imports of the country, it will only be necessary to
examine the following table:

It will he seen hy this table, that within the past eight
years the tjieatest Sanation from year to 5 ear in the value
of our exports was $11,352,266, while the imports have va-
ried in one year, from 1839 to 1840, $54,950,613. We see in
these great iiuctuations the cause of the revulsions of trade.
