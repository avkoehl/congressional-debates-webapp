Richmond, Va., December 13, 1862.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD, Charleston, S. C.:

General Lee has just telegraphed to General Smith as follows:

For Wilmington and the coast of North Carolina draw re-enforcements from North Carolina and General Beauregard.

Other intelligence induces General Smith to conjecture the purpose of the enemy to march in conjunction with the force from their fleet to be landed at Beaufort, on the railroad, and then to assail Wilmington in reserve. It is recommended to you, in case of intelligence confirmatory of such movements, to act on the suggestion of General Lee, and send re-enforcements if, and to the extent, you think it can be done without too greatly risking your command. Should communication between Wilmington and this city be broken you will give to Wilmington special attention and such aid as you spare. Of this order General Whiting will be notified.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
