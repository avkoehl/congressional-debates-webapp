APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Maine Boundary Question—Mr. Lincoln,
229
Ho. of Reps 
by that Minister, and «¡ay to her, " settle this
matter between youiselves; you had better do
what to you shall seem best about it; consider
the great danger that must attend a state of wai-
fare, and make it up between yourselves,"
And besides, it did appear to Mr. A., fiora the
tone of the coriespondence which had taken
place between the Governois of Maine and New
Biunswick, that they weie not exactly the par-
ties who were in a temper fit to settle a disputed
national question between themselves, without
any icpiesentative of the General Government to
stand by Maine in the arrangement This
seemed, on the pait of the Government, the as-
sumption of a sort of neutral position. He
hoped no such thing was intended, he hoped he
had not correctly undeistood the matter, but that
the letter of Mr. Forsyth to the Governor of
Maine would be thoioughly examined, and, if it
contained no such idea, that the Committee on
Foieign Affairs would so lepoit to the House,
oi else that they would have an undeistanding
with the Executive, so that all dangei fiom that
quaitei might be íemoved
Mi. CR.ARY here moved the pievious ques-
tion, but the House refused to second it—ayes
48, noes 89.
Mr. LINCOLN said that the peculiar position
which he had occupied in relation to one ot the
States most immediately and duectly interested
would not peimu him to lemain silentduring the
discussion of a subject so deeply mipoitant to the
count!y It was this intiinsic impoitance of tlio
subject which alone induced him to thtow himself
upon the indulgence of the House foi some le-
niaiks winch natuially giew out of the nosiuon
which his State might seem to ot cupy m tins nnit-
tei before the country
Mr L stated that an appeal h id been made to
the Executive by the State of Massachusetts on
the veiy point now in contioveisy, and jt could
not have escaped the observation of eveiy mem-
bei how that appeal had been íespondtd to Pos-
sibly some misapprehension might have grown
outof the mannei in which the appeal inquestion
had been mi t This was no new subject of com-
plaintwith that people,oi with their Government,
it had been his painful duty, for yeais, to con-
template it as one of the most unpleasant portions
of his public concern Theie had beenaformei
period when the peace of thecountiy was as much
threatened as at piesent; at that tune, one of the
citizens ot the United States had been taken fiom
his own dwelling, (fiom what the law dechued
to be his castle,) and earned off like a felon, and
mcaicei ated in a Butish piison As gieat a de-
gree of excitement had pervaded the public mind
then as now. It had then been Mi L 's lotto
paiticipate in the gieat lesponsioihty of those I
counsels, which, in the good providence of God, I
had pioved instiumental in piestivmg the na- l|
tional peace, and possibly liom this veiy leason I
he could not but anticipate at piesent a like favor-
able issue. He had listened with unmingled sat-
isfaction to the language of the official communi
cation which hid just been laid beioie the House,
and he did believe that, if the sentiments and the
temper which mai Iced that executive message
should influence the counsels of the two Houses
of Congiess, all dangei of a rupture of the public
peace would be happily removed
Weie it propei to go mto a view of the causes
which had led to the existing difficulties, it would
not be difficult to justify the ground taicen by our
own Government in itgard to the disputed tcru-
tory. There could not lemam a doubt in the
mmd of any reasonable being that the rectitude
of the claims of the State of Maine to the pos-
session of that temtory, as an integral portion of
her soil, were beyond all just controveisy. No-
body who would look into the facts could doubt
that the true boundary line between that State
and the adjacent Bi itish possessions was as clear! y
defined on the actual face of the country as it was
in the language of the tieaty of 1783 But while
he held most stiongly that the light of Maine to
the jurisdiction of thi3 poition of her temtoiy
was irrefiagable, still he could not but think that
a little more forbearance on hoi pait would better
have comported with the dictates of sound dis-
cretion and enlightened patriotism. He believed
that the State of Maine would discredit her own
wisdom, violate her own interest, and do injustice
to the patnotism of the nation, if she should re-
fuse a little longer to forbear, in the hope that the
last fatal resott for the redress of national griev-
ances might be avoided. What was the cause
of the present discussion* An attempt to exei-
cise jurisdiction over a portion of country, in re-
gard to which there might have been on either
side a misconception as to the right of the other
paity. Was it a strange thing that such a tms-
corception should exist' Was this a matter to
be wondered at, when for ten consecutive years
it had been a debatable subject, each nation claim-
ing jurisdiction over the same poition of the soil'
In 1832, the Secretaiy of State of the United
States addressed an official communication to the
States of Maine and Massachusetts, demanding
of them an account of their reasons for an en-
croachment by their respective agents on this
very teintory—a letter fiom no less distinguished
and tempeiatc an individual than Louis McLane,
inquiring how it came to pGss that a land agent
of the State of Massachusetts was found on the
waters of the Aroostook Now, if the Govern-
ment of our own countiy could feel itself justified
in asking such a question, was it very marvel-
ous that some misconception on the same sub-
ject should exist on the part of the British Gov-
ernment
Mi L hoped he should not be misconceived
foi a moment He intimated no doubt, foi he
had no doubt, as to the justice of the claims of
the State ot Maine, ho admitted them to then
utmost extent, and he would sacuficeall that was
de u to himself, and mu< h that was clear to the i
countiy, befoie he would consent she should give
up one iota of uer demand, in submission to the
claim of a foieign Government And he would
now say, m behalf of his own State, although she
had not buckled on hei armoi at the indication of
her sistei, she would be none the less tiue to hei,
and none the 'ess fn in m defending her and her
lights, when it became necessary that she should
piace herself by h< r side in the fiont of battle.
in 1833, this British land agent, McLaughlin,
piefei red the same claims as he did now; and Mr
L. held in his hand a document which would
show that his chums were then as much aground
o<" complaint and remonstrance on the part of
Massachusetts
The extent of these pietensions might be
gatlieied fiom the íeprescntations made by Mi.
McLaughlin, subsciibing himself " Warden of
the disputed terntory," in a communication ad I
diesied to Su Aiclnbild Campbell, under date of
the 28lh of September, 1833, from which Mi L
n>ad the following extiact:
" Since Í h lvo the honor of the appointment of \\ aiden

This representation had been made (said Mr
L ) the occasion of a demand, by Mi McLane,
of an exp'anation fiom the Goveinoi of Massa-
chusetts of the exe'cise of a right ofsupeivision
ovci the property of the Commonwealth in the
disputed terntory, m the following language-

Governor of New Biun.wick, to Sir Challes It Vaughan,
and also of a letter from Lieutenant J A McLaughlin to
Mr Archibald Campbell, complaining ol the conduct otcei

Great Britain I am instructed to state that it would lie i

piovo to be well founded , and m <uuM g it to be commu-

thorities of Massachusetts to enforce a clue obedience to
Iho terms of tilt existingarrangenx at between the Govern
meat of the United States and that of treat Britain in íe-
gard to tlie disputed teintoij  
There was something more than an admission
of a concurrent junsdiction on the part of Great
Britain, a taking to task, even, of the Executive
of Massachusetts for interposing a preventive
authouty foi the protection of the propei ty in
the lands. The Secretary of State of the United
States alludes " to the terms of the existing ar-
langement," an airangement winch, if it means
anything, must have reference to the " warien-
ilap" of the terntory claimed by McLaughlin,
and made the subject of Sir Archibald Camp-
bell's communication It was true (continued
Mi. L.j this claim of British junsdiction, now
foi the first time distinctly put forth, was not
submitted to by the Government of Massachu-
setts The wmdenship of the terntory by the
Bntish agent was resisted, and, in the most earn-
est language of remonstiance, the Federal Gov-
ernment was admonished that it would not be
íccognized by the Government of the State. To
show the opinion then entertained of thisextraor-
dinaiy claim, Mi L said he would take the hb-
eity to lead the protest made by the Executive
of Massachusetts to the Secietai y of State against
any such pietension.
Mi L then lead fiom a lettei of the Governor
of Massachusetts to Mi McLane, under date of
Novembei 1, 1833, the following extract:
' I cannot but ea ncnly piotest against the authority of
any appointment on the behalf ot his Majesty's Govern-
niuit, which maybe íegarded as a claim to the exclusive
piotecuon ot Ibis propi rtv, or be deemed an acquiescence,
on the part of the United States, m interference, undercolor
of a wardenslnp ot the disputed temtoiy, with that direc-
tion to its improvement which ttie governments of Massa-
chusetts and Vlaine, respectively m ty «ee fit to give to their
agents The rights of soil and juusrhction over it are in the
States, and foibearanee to the exeiciseot these rights for a
season from mere prudentill consider uions, a respectful
regara to the wishes of the General Government, or comity
toward  a foreign nation, is not to be consfiued into a read-
iness to sunenuer them upon the issue of any proposed ne-
gotiation "
Also, an extract fiom an executive communi-
cation of the Governor of Massachusetts to Mr.
McLane, under date of November 15, 1833-
<( No just occasion has been given, on the pait of the gov-
ernment ot Massachusetts, for the rcpiesentations trans-

Here was evidence both of a chum to jurisdic-
tion on the one hand, and a dticct protest on the
othei, against the act of the Bntisn authoutits 111
appointing a warden, as he was denominated,
who should intoifeieto prevent the improvement
of the territory, 01 mtcifere in any manner with
the property of Maine 01 of Massachusetts Yet,
from the year 1833 to 1839, this warden had been
maintained in office by the British Government.
And now it was heldthatan act natuiallyenough
consequent upon his appointment was ajust foun-
dation foi a declaiation of war; and this without
allowing anv oppoitunity foi explanation
Mi L couhl not believe that wat was at all
necessary, if the juixsdiction was proved to be
in the Unted States, it must result fiom tne uno

This wis to be setiled 111 lt-i pnnticil application
