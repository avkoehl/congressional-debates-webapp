day at about 10 a.m.; attacked them; was successful in first charge, driving them, killing 3 first fire; enemy fell back; scouts followed until they struck the main body, where the scouts where driven back with loss of 7 men- 1 killed, 1 mortally wounded, balance missing. Enemy must have suffered severely in both attacks, from all accounts. Conflicting statements as to their artillery. Some told the scouts four and some six pieces, and the force ran from 500 to 2,000. I am satisfied it is the force I reported to you through my Savannah scout. I have sent to Fayetteville scouts, also to Florence, to learn all that is possible as to enemy's movements, numbers, &amp;c. I understand that Third Tennessee has been sent to Athens, from your dispatch. Unless I hear from you to the contrary I shall make my headquarters at Elk River bridge, moving at about 6 p.m. Cannot a telegraph operator be sent to Elk River bridge&lt;

This looks like a great scattering of the flock. Roddey was at Lamb's Ferry yesterday, with about 1,600 men.

My scouts have come in and report all quiet at Fayetteville and Winchester. I believe that Wheeler is not about there. Have left all my troops at Elk River bridge, except 100 men. Have sent troops to Sulphur trestle; will leave the troops at both points for a day or two.
