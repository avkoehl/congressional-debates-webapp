after the explosion in front of the Eighteenth Corps on our right, the enemy shelled our line vigorously for about half an hour, causing some casualties. Some of the pickets of the right of our line ran in at the time of the explosion, but the line was immediately re-established. An officer of the Third Maryland Volunteers reports, from his own observation, that the advanced sap driven by the Eighteenth Corps, near the enemy's works, was blown up by the enemy. Our men had notice of the explosion in time to save themselves, very few being injured.
