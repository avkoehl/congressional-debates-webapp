to 3 eg i impF íal euii. &¿ Let nit, not be accu&ed oí attempt
mg to t  e u Jiiece^saiy alarm, or to invoke imagimiy fears-
I is the alseseemny in which we are reposing that mo^i ex
cites my appi*3 lensions 1 he first encroachments on the liber
ty of any country are always by the stealthy, noiseless steps of
usurped and unsuspected power The blind confidence re
posea m party leaders, the base submission to party dictation,
the tame surrender of the independence of the representative
charactu to the Executive will, all, all combine to raise the
most painful forebodings m the mind of every one who lo-vea
his country and chei i^hes her free institutions
Su we have every cause 'or apprehension and alarm We
have seen $he < ountry, m the palmiest days of her prospenty,
s ' V ly plunged into the deepest embarrassment and dihttess
tirougt Executive instrumentality We have seen our mei
chantb siciificing their ample means to sustain a sinking cíe
dit—sinking by the adverse at tion oí the Government upon the
confidence of the people We have seen their families aban
domng their hom^s and tneir firesides to pine in penury and
want, and buffering for the oidmary comforts and conveniences
of life We have seen the husband and the father, aftei strug
ghng tosusiainhis wife and his children against the unfeeling
action of his own Government, finally sink to an untimely
grave, the vicum of oppression and despair We have seen the
¡sturdy operations of the mechanic industry of the country sus
pended We have seen the looms and the spindles of the manu
factnrer stopped We have seen the farmer, with his hand to
the plough, look back to see if he, too, was to be overtaken by
the < desolating tornade " which had swept away eveiy otnei
occupation atound him bir, heisthe last to be reached, but
his time is yet to conu, if the Administration persist m these
destructive measures When the products of his industry «shall
remain upon his hands—when, by íeason of the destruction of
other branches of business, it shall not pay the cost of prod tu
tion—when the pnce of his ^nd shall sink so fai asnotto meet
the incumbrance which may chance to rest upon it, he will
then wipe the sweat from his biow and with his biawny arm
hurl from the high seats of power those who have forgotten the
great interests of the countiy m the ignoble pursuits of paity
Sir, we ha\ e seen the Government itself become bankiupt un
der the veryopeiations by which it has bankrupted the com
munity We have seen the Executive asking of Congress the
means of keepm«* its wheels m motion and at the same time die
tatmg throw?!- his organs, the amount and the mannei in whioh
those means sho ild be granted We have seen the \dmims
tration plunging the cuuntiymto a national debt without the
insrenuousne^ to acknowledge it We have seen them report
ing to every expedient to meet the cunentexpen&es oí the Go
vernment and at the same time by their destructive policy,
cutting off the sources of revenue by which atone the mean*
can be supplied and we shall see a «still further applicatioi ftr
supolie«!j reidered necessary by the olm lne s, the fatuity the
wilfulness, nay, the mc ompetency, of those who have brought us
to this state ot bankruptcy of shame, and of dcgradition We
hav e seen thoJQandsand thousands of our iellow cuiztns utter y

colleague's proposition whieh is to fasten iheSub Tieasury
upon us till the year 1S41 And how is he to fasten it upon u&?

gress all legislative control over the revenues of the country i&

Mi    Picbident   the   Senator  from  North   Carolina  [Mi
Strange] has this morning mourned over the humiliated, the
íal'en, thedegiaded, the disgraced condition of the Democratic
paity, as he is pleaded to ter n tho'fe who, wi h him, are at
tempting to carry out the principies of the ultra Federalism
of 93    He complains that they have been beaten in their pio
jects, and brought to this hoiribie predicament, because they
ha^eb^tn abanduned by a fiagmtnt of their friends    &i ,

the Senator now finds himself, and fiom which he will be un

dially with us to aid the banks m the lesumption of  specie
payments to revive bjsmesa, and to restore the pi o^penty of
the country    The magic influence of the Executive recom

tempest that was raised, and all would again have been  peace
and quiet    I impeach no man's motives toi the course he has

interests of the country subservient to the low and grovelling
¡- ursuits of party—a Demociacy which permits no action on
any question, however urgent tne necessity mav be, without
orleib from headquarters—a Democracy that appeals to the
passions and piejudices of the people instead of enlightening-
then judgment-  and relying upon their reason and their pa-
tt lot m—a Demnciacy which attempts to set up one class of
the community agair^t the other, as if their interests were not
recip ocal and if entica'—a Democracy which denies to eveiy
man the right to thu k and act for himself on those great ques-
tions m which the vital interests of the country are so deeply
irvolved—a Demociatsy which attempts, by party drill and
pai ty discipline to subvert the very spirit of the Constitution,
to «u^stttute Executive for Legislative power, to subject the
wiU >f the Representative to the will of the Executive, to com-
pe h m to aU contrary to his own opinion*, against his own

SPEECH   OF  ME.  WEBSTER,
Of Massachusetts,
In Se mié, March 12, 1838—On the Sub-Treasury Bill
Mr President Having at an early s age of the debate, ex

T o be ab e, m this state of thing*, to give a preponderance to

the revet u aidexoenditure of Government, and his expected
to acf, aNo indirectly, on commerce and current), while its
friends and «upportei*, altogether abstain from other measureSj
