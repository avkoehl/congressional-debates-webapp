Post Office appropriation Bill—Mr. Payne.
H. of Reps.
SPEECH OF MR. PAYNE,
OF ALABAMA
In lhe House of Representatives, August Hi, 1841—
In Commmutee of the Whole on 'he b 11 to
make appropriations for the Post Office Depart-
ment.
Mr. Chaibman: Ow ng to the extraordinary
mode of legislation adopiect by the wi-dom ot the
dominant party .n thisha1!, it is impossible to place
one's self properly before the country m otVi way
than by an esp.e -ion c f his views upon this floor.
Ids with that view I ncv a k ¡be mda'gence of
the committee.
Mr. P said, be bad not .i-cn to define his posi-
tion in politics—"pnncip!e->, not men," was the mot-
to oí the Democra'ic piity e/eiy where; Nor'h,
Somh, East, or West, they are tbs sat^e. It is
the s.treng>h and jas*¡C3 of tbo-e princp'e-s which
unite us together; and he trusted the day will
never come when fa obalJ be round cavilling about
the support of any ma¡A or Administration, who
will faithfully Mid lattlv carry tnose principles
into full opera'ion m administering tbisGovei'i-
mont.
I must be permitted lo say, however, that I have
no confidence i i the Postmaster Cerera!, [Mr.
Granger.] He hns th  dark spot of Abolition upon
hts political repjtaticn.
[Heie Mr. Payne w?s in ierra pted by Mr. Jimes
of Pennsyivairi, who said he .hould answer Mr.
Payhe.]
S.r, said Mr P ttw ger bnan is h'm^clf an
Abolitionist. Gentlemen around ell me r.e is an
Abolitionist. I lepeat, I have no confidence in
that black hearted trie, who pr tend they owe a
higher obligation  o their Abolí ion engagements,
than they do   the Constitutionot the country.
Mr. Fillmosb of New York asked Mi Payne
if he knew Mr. Granger to be an Aboli'iomst.
Mr. Paíne. I only know Mr. Granger to be
an Abolitionist, as wp know any fact of vh.^h
proof is the bas's of behkf.    (^'ee note )
In hii appointments to office he selects Aboli-
tionists, as' I am informed by various g-ntlemen
who surround me. (See note U) 8 r, Mr Tyh>r
should at once l'p off this eiiensivo excresc-nce
from his admimsfanon; it is necessary to give thai
qutetto public appieiension, and to inspire that
confidence in the publ.c mind, Aithont whit ¡^suc-
cess can never attend his aJmmii>tt_Uoa of the
affiiis of this Republic.
Tne bill under consideration p oposes to opn-o-
pr'-te  to  the Post  Office Díprntne.t $M7,6o7,
The first inquiry ought to be, Ooes the Department
owe that amount of ¡none},  aid to wiom is it
owed?    However much, 3tr, I might deprecate tae
scheme oí quartering the Post Ofice  upon  the
Treasun, suppled,  as it no v is, by nines upon
imports alone, 1 wou.d yet vet; -h  full apprcpr a-
non asted ¡or by th- b ", if it wete nec-ssary t >
piy thit encige ic clpss oí  men who air engaged
in transporting  the  mails  throughout the 'engtn
and  breadth oí  t-ia Confederacy.    I  wiu.d rot
withheld one c at due to these .-atn, but I fin not
willm   t' appropriate one dollar b-yo'.d wnat i-.
needed to pay them, nor v ill I do -o.    Intby-'o-
cament before me, sent to the Hou>e by th~   o-..-
icster General,  it is sa.d that, «^ addition U 'he
unpaid  demands already nottc-d, the-c a-e othor

ciencv o-i the 30th ef June to $347,637 "    lhis is
the entire defioieuc/ m t le Pe s O*ce Department.
D,d  the bill  under cfisiderat'on prop s" to sup-
ply thot deficiency only, it voi>ld afioid --e pl-a-
bute to supply it; but, «ir, tt go.s fnnh^r; it «ppro-
priatcs $150,000 more '    F >r wlnt purpts^    Not
fo pay the earners of the mail, or any ether . eot
due by this Department; no, sir, b t f t
provi<e lor unavai.ah'e batane
fluctuations in the revenue and
geactcs'"
Mr Chanman, I trust gcn'le>nen will pardon
me when 1 inform them, that I do n&t vote for
th-se "contingent" appreciations, They aic the
most convenient funds imaginable to increase the
patronage of this Government.   My object is to
,rr)'m "to
i gcard pganist
d fr.sy  c> titoi-
dimmish, and not to increase that patronage.
Moreover, the public Treasury is exhausted, and
requires sinct economy m its adminiUiation.
Already have you forced upon Ihe country a re-
venue bill, ia\my a ¡ax of twee y per cent, on
sugar, molasses, c"rr>«, te?. bleached and unbleach-
ed linens; ihe pohc) of which is jus.ified from the
a leged deficiency w revenue. If it be trae that
this deficiency d> es really exist, why vote these
contingent appropriation"? It will not diminish t<-e
bu-dens of the p opb, or force economy in the
administration of this Department, but to the con-
truy, they will opprets tbepeop!", famish the
means, and beg^t a  pirit of extr¿va anc? m the
entire business, a*id pianag-m-nt of u. Tois, sir,

Wilh due de'erenee to the opinion of o'hers, I
must be permitted to siy I caí pcrceiv • but
two posible reasons why an/ party m this

and en that day he took possession of the Depait-

pertect refutation of the charge of debt contracted
b/ his predecessors.
But, s"", the idea of the existence of a national
debt was necessary to afford a plausible pretext for
an increase of the tariff; and Mr. Secrelary Ewing
went to figuring, to make out the debt. How? He
tikes the outstanding apptopnations of previous
years, and sets them down as debts due by the pre-
vious Administration Now, sir, 1 ask you if
there is any liability esistmg against the Gover -
