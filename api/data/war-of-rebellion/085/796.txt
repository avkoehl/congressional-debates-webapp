sufficient amount of subsistence for his command. You will keep scouts out in all directions that there may be any likelihood of an enemy, and in compliance with General Orders, Numbers 54, from headquarters Department of Kansas, you will close all business houses in Fort Scott, and order all, black and white, between the ages of sixteen and sixty, under arms at once.

OLATHE, October 11, 1864.

Major-General BLUNT:

About 200 militia have reported; the number is not increasing rapidly; all from Johnson County thus far. Every effort possible is being made in this section to get them out.

PLEASANT HILL, October 11, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS,

Fort Leavenworth:

Price will, I think, enter Kansas near Little Santa Fe. Am I not too far south? As he will probably pass north of me, would not Hickman Mills be more protection to Kansas? Hickman Mills is about half way from here to Kansas City.

Colonel J. H. FORD,

Pleasant Hill, or in the Field:

Have your troops all in motion. Move them from place to place. The militia must guard the town, and the enemy must not know where to find and surround my cavalry. Send baggage to the rear.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 11, 1864.

Colonel FORD:

I suppose the lines are open. It is said bushwhackers are gathering on the Blue, some 100 or 200 strong. Better break up their arrangements. General Rosecrans reports Price did not take Jefferson City; left there last night; threatens Lexington. I wish you could get communication with that place; keep on the watch. I take the field immediately, but will keep on telegraphic lines. The entire militia of the State are moving on your rear. Blunt is at Paola. Lane will be with me at Olathe to-morrow. What is your news?

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
