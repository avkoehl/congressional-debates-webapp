ble, could not attain its object, and therefore could
not be made In this case, the bill had passed both
Houses, and could not again come under the ac-
tion of either, except oy the express provision of
the Constitution. That provision is mandatory and
explicit It prescribes the only legislative action
which can take place on the President's objections
and the bill. The Honse r> directed "to enter the
objections at large on then- journal, and proceed to
reconsidet it," (the bi'l ) The question oi recon-
sideration, threefore, is raised by the Constitution
It is a reconsideration of the bill—not merely of the
vote on its passage, it is the only question which is
raised in reference to the bill, and d is one which
the House is not at liberty to evade or suppress
The objections whieh the Constitution requires the
President, if he does not approve, to assign,
do no more than suspend the bill, whicn, with-
out them, would become a law, and which,
notwithstanding them, may become a law, it,
on the reconsideraaon which is rot only per-
mitted, but prescribed, it is "approvd by
two-thirds " The Cons union, thcefore, clear
Jy es ntetnplates that whe.i a In' is re'urn
ed with objections by the P esuknt, it shall be
subj cted to the test of another votr The impon
anee attached to tms requis lion by th' wise art
patriotic framers of the Cons itutio->, may be in-
terred from th^ provision tiat "ia ill such cases,
the votes in both Houses s'lsll be determired by
yeas  and na>s." If the Fid—al Executive had
been invested with an absolute, instead ft a qual-
ified ve'o, there would have been no necessity for
these precau ions, to >n«ure a \ ote on the recon-
sideration Congress are no more at liberty to fail
or refuse to reconsider the b 11 returned with ob-
jections, than the President would be to aecluie to
approve or return it with his objections, The bill
cannot be altered, in any respect, by one or both
Houses. The Hjusc to which it is returned i« not
at liberty to separate the objections from the b 11
Tbey are to be entered on its journal, and the bill—
if two-thirds shall prss it— s to b? sent, "together
with the objections to the other House " Before
any bill can become a law, it must be "presented
"to the President" If he ipprove, it is a law If
he return it, he is bound lo s ate Iks objections, and
Congress are not permitted to convert the qualified
power of the Executive to subject a bill to another
direct vote on the yeas and nay, mfo an unqual-
ified and absolute veto, as they may effectually do
by refusing to proceed to the reconsideration, or by
silently acquiescing in the President's objections
without another vote The objtclions of a Presi
dent operate as a check on the unconstitutional or
inconsiderate legislation of a mere majority m the
first instance, and two-third., on the reconsidera-
tion, are ai effectual a check on the veto.
Under the Constitution, "each House may deter-
mine the rules of its proceedings," but, in this par-
ticular tase, the Constitution itseif nas determined
the rule of proceed ng    The  question, then, i
whether that  rule  is  paramount oi mflex b'e, or
whether, like  ordinary rtJes, u can be modified,
suspendeu, or abrof ated     Does the reconsideration
enjoined  by the   Constitution give  the Htuse «i

Th t same majority mav re'n^e 'o take it up i„ain
and  thus prevent a vote on the reconsider? ti >r,
in this instance, a majority have laid the bill on the
table, and have refused to take it up It depends
on the will of that majority whether it shall be
taken np and reconndered at all They have
then claimed, and by force of numbers exer-
cised, an authority which may altogether disre-
gard and dispense with the positive requisition
of the Constitution. They have separated the
bill from the objections. The former may, or
it may not, be brought to a dnect vote on its
merits with the yeas 8nd nays. It may be expe-
dient for the bare majority of four, by which it
originally passed, to permit this bill to slumber
forever, under the indirect vote to lay on the table—
a vote which does not involve the merits of the
bill, i or meet the requisitions of the Constitution
The power to lay on the table, is a power which
can piso commit to a «elect or standing committee,
or to a committee of the whole, where the yeas
and nays cannot be had, or which can postpone
indefinitely beyond the session The power as
sumed in the<e different modes is the same It is
the power to control the Cons^tuti^n by arbitiary
ru es, and by the paity vote of a bare majority of
one Hi u«e of Congress The message contamin<
the President'  objections 1 as been íeterred to this
committee The power of iht committee does not
extend beyond the subject referred Reasons or
recommendations may be reported, in ¿nswer or
in c< naexion wiih the objections, b it it is not com-
petent for thi , or iny other committee, constitu-
tionally to repoit any measun which will obstruct
the reconsideration ot the bill The committee
can, then, neither sugges' nor accomplish any
piactieal object ot legislation, consistent with the
Constitution They cinnot report an or gmal bill,
or any amendment to the b 11 now on the table
They mav recommend an impeachment or a cen-
sure of the Pre idea', bu , if this recommendation
assumes the form of a reiolutun, the question in
the House is on trie report of the cornmitfee, and
no on the bill As two questions cannot be voted
on at once, this question must either supersede the
reconsideration or the bill, or it must interpose a
new question, not con'emplated by the Constitu-
tion.
Government abounds in examples of conflicts be-
tween the several departments. It has sometimes
1 happened that all the departments combined to
overthrow the Constitution, and, but for the írtelli-
gence of the people, and the controlling power of
the suffrage, in restoring the supremacy of the
Constitution over the Legislature, the Executive,
and the Judieiary, such combinations must have
been fatal to our institutions. While it is the priv-
ilege and the duty of every citizen to arraiga
either department of the Government, or any pub-
lic officer, for infidelity to the Constitution and
the laws, it is neither wise, just, nor patriotic, for
one of those departments to impair the confidence
or the harmony which should subsist between the
separate branches of the public service, by foment-
ing prejudices and discord. They are all agents of
the people. Their duties are prescribed by a law
which all acknowledge as supreme.
Without inquiring into the motives wh ch in-
duced the framers of the Constitution to attribute
the powers of our government as they havt done,
and to confer the particular power in question on
the Executive, and without reviewing the actual
experience of the Government, as to wl^t (from.
a "Upposed analogv, not at all obvi< 's, to c ram
powers m other Governments) is cot mo dy called
the veto power, it is natural that the mind should
approve or condemn the exeicse of thi-, power, ac-
cording to its interests, opinion*, or pvejadic s, on.
the subject to which it is applied. This is true,
not only as to this, but ps to all other powers of
Government. Zeal in the pursuit of some cherish-
ed object of interest or ambition induces some men
no' only to complain when they are th varted by
what they easily believe to be an improper exer-
cise of power, but to make war on the established
forms of government, and to seek, by revolution
or radical change, what they cannot lawfully ob-
tain The disposition, which has been recently
manifested to some extent, to disturb the well-
adjusted checks of the Constitution, by claiming
powers for Congress which that instrument does
not confer, or by denying to a co ordinate brunch
oí Government powers which it does confer, in
order to e tablish a particular system of party po-
licy, or to carry an election, must be regarded with
deep regret and serious apprehension by the peo-
ple— hose whose province it is to judge, and who,
free from the bias of mere party politics, can thmk
and feel and act under the superior influences of
patriotism. Our Government has survived the
shock of many severe political contests, because
hitherto these contests have involved only a dif-
ference of opinion as to the principles and pohey
of the Government, as organized. It has been
deemed unwise, as well as dangerous, to exaspe-
rate local or general prtjudices against the acknowl-
edged forms of the Government, and to enlist the
spirit of revolution as an auxiliary to the spirit of.
party.
It has b en la'ely proposed to abolish the powers
resulting to th" Executive from the clause of the
C nsutution already cited There is no evidence of
any disposition to second this purpose, either oa
the part ot Congiess itself, or on the part of the
States Despainnzof any peaceiul change, itwnow-
proclaimed that this power is so dangerous to lib-
erty as to i istify an appeal to arms. This is
uraed by those who e'esre to secure the enact-
ment of ürieaaures bel eved probably by a major ty
of U e people of the United States, and certainly
by the p e^ent Executive to be either unconsti-
tutional or g'ossly inexpedient and injurious To
obta a tV charter for a national bank, when there
a e few bold enough to believe that any prudent
man would hazard his capital or bis confidence
under the charier, or "till further to impoverish
an a'ready empty and indebted treasury, it is pro-
posed to abolish, by amending the Cor^titr ion, or
by revolution, one of the checks by which ihe Ex-
ecutive Department is authorized to ane t tht un-
consattttioaal measures of Congress,   A doubie
It is not maintained that the consideration en-
joined by Ihe Constitution precludes discussion in
any form, but that the reconsideration of the bill,
with the objections, is imperative, and that it is not
within the legitimate power of Congress, by any
st rt of parliamentary device, to avoid it, or to alter
or modify the direct quest on presented by the Con-
stitution, by qualifying or connecting it with any
other extraneous question. If it be true, then, that
this committee can report no measure to the House
affecting the bill whieh the House is required to
reconsider, nothing remains which they cando, but
to present, in the shape of a report, argument ,
which could be as well, if not better, presented m
debate fh s is the most innocent design which
can be imputed to this movement. It is to imbody
in a more impo in  form, and to present from a
new point ol altark, principles a id prejud ces
whiJi have always been hostile to th' true spirit
of the Const tu ton Under the sp-cious pretext of
