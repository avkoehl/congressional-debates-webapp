Major General SAMUEL JONES:

Enemy's cavalry, 2,500 strong, reported advancing on salt-works, and were 25 miles from Moccasin Gap on the 16th. Do not know if reports are true. General Marshall reported at Pound Gap. Can you co-operate for defense?

Brigadier General JOHN S. WILLIAMS, Saltville:

GENERAL: Telegram just received announces that enemy's cavalry, 2,500 strong, are reported to be advancing on the salt-works, and were 25 miles from Moccasin Gap on the 16th.

General Marshall is said to be at Pound Gap. Two batteries have been sent you. One thousand men will be sent immediately from Jenkins' command, and other troops will be moved in the same direction.

The major-general commanding directs you to hold the passes leading to the salt-works at all hazards, and he thinks, with the forces he will send and those you have, the enemy cannot only be repulsed, but merely punished.

Very respectfully, general, your obedient servant,CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA, Dublin, April 18, 1863.

Brigadier General W. G. M. DAVIS,

Commanding, &amp;c., Knoxville, Tenn.:

I am making the necessary arrangements for defending the salt-works. If Marshall is at Pound Gap, and falling back in the direction of Abingdon, he ought not only to hold the salt-works but punish the enemy. Was it 25 miles from Big or Little Moccasin Gap that the enemy is reported?

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

Major General SAMUEL JONES:
