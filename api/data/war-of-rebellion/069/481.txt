HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 2, 1864-7.20 a. m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

The condition of General Smith's command is such that your instructions of last night are so far modified as to require you to leave a division in the vicinity of Cold Harbor to aid General Smith, in case he should require it, and until he is supplied with ammunition. I am now on my way to Sixth Corps headquarters.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,June 2, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The First Division of my corps arrived here at 6 o'clock, and is now forming in rear of General Wright's left. It will be some time before the corps is up and in position, having been considerably opened out during the night. On consultation with General Wright I think I shall form on his left. He thinks that two divisions would reach to the high ground, virtually controlling the ground between it and the Chickahominy. I shall admit no unnecessary delay, but it will be several hours before my command is ready to attack. I have about twelve regiments on picket, who did not leave till 2 this morning, and there was a good deal of straggling, owing to extreme fatigue of the men and the dusty roads.

WING'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,June 2, 1864-8.20 a. m.
