HEADQUARTERS, May 2, 1863-10.13 a.m.

General HOOKER:

Is the order still effective for General Gibbon to move to Banks' Ford to-day with his whole division, or to wait until it is uncovered?*

General HOOKER, and Commanding Officer, Sixth Corps:

Gibbon reports at 12 m. that everything in our front seems perfectly quiet; few of the enemy to be seen. Hills back of Fredericksburg, near Telegraph road, occupied. Small force in the rifle-pits opposite Falmouth, and this force increased last night, probably anticipating a dash on our part.
