THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 27,
ing to the consideration of that resolution, but
the Chair did not hear me. I do not think it
is a measure that we should pass at this stage
of the session.
Mr. SUMNEB. It was considered in com-
mittee carefully.
Mr. BUCKALEW. I know it was consid-
ered in committee about five minutes perhaps;
but it was not investigated. I am inclined to
the opinion that the principle of paying inter-
est which it recognizes is one which has not
been followed by the Government, and is a
departure from our uniform practice. It seems
that some bill passed at some stage in our his-
tory in relation to a claim of Maryland; and
that is seized upon and pressed into the ser-
vice obviously upon the face of this resolution,
because it requires some support other than
that derived from general principles.
Mr. SUMNER. Simply to apply the rule
here; that is all. This resolution is merely to
have these claims audited ; that is all.
Mr. BUCKALEW. The claims date back
to 1812 or 1815. How much they are, what
is their nature, what equities are connected
with them, we know nothing about, and we
have not time now to investigate. I have
never seen any papers in the case.
Mr. SUMNER. There were ample papers
before the committee of which the Senator is
a member; it was considered on three several
days in that committee, and finally the com-
mittee came to the conclusion which is ex-
pressed in the resolution.
Mr. BUCKALEW. I presume the com-
mittee had about the information the Senate
have; and that is the fact that the Senator
from Massachusetts has convinced himself
that this amount ought to be paid.
Mr. SUMNER. Not at all. I took com-
paratively little interest in it; others on the
committee took more interest in it that I did.
The Senator from Maine, who is now absent,
[Mr. Mockili,,] took a deep interest in it. -
Mr. BUCKALEW. It is against the prac-
tice of the Government to pay interest upon
unascertained demands.
Mr. PO.MUUOY. In my State we cannot
get the Government to pay us the principal of
what it owes us. The Government owes us
for organizing troops and wo cannot get the
principal.
Mr. 1SUCKALKW. Unascertained, unset-
tled obligations of a Government, as a general
rule, bear no interest. Jt seems to me like a
profcty "smart" proceeding to hunt up some
precedent, which may have been accidental or
the result of peculiar circumstances, and to
use that to pile upon the Government a quan-
tity of interest on these old claims.
Mr. SUMNER. If the Senator perseveres
iu his objection of cotrse I shall not press the
resolution now.
Mr. BUCKALEW. I think it my duty to
object.

HENRY WILSON,
IRA HARRIS, â€¢
Managers on thepart of the Senate.
J. F. FARNSWORTH,
NELSON TAYLOR,
Managers on the part of the Mouse.
Mr. HOWARD. I should like to hear some
explanation of the report of this committee of
conference.
Mr. WILSON. The'Senate bill as passed
by us, with very few modifications, is the bill
as it now stands, the amendments being of very
little account, excepting one on which we had
the main controversy. The bill as passed by
the Senate provided for six additional regi-
ments of cavalry, making twelve regiments al-
together. That is altered to four additional
regiments; we give up two. We have the same
number of artillery regiments and infantry regi-
ments as the Senate bill provided. The forty-
five infantry regiments are made up in this way:
thirty-seven white regiments, composed of the
ten old regiments and the twenty-seven battal-
ions with ten companies added ; then four regi-
ments of colored troops, and four regiments
of Yetcran Reserves. This is our bill with a
few slight amendments.
Tho report was concurred in.
EXECUTIVE SESSION.
The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of executive business, and after fifteen minutes
spent therein the doors were reopened at ten
minutes before five o'clock a. m.
CIVIL APPROPRIATION BILL.
Mr. SHERM AN, from the second committee
on conference on the disagreeing votes of the
two Houses on the bill (H. R. No. 737) making
appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the
Government for the year ending 80th June,
1807, and for other purposes, reported that^
after full and free conference, the committee
were unable to agree.
Several Senators. What shall be done?
Mr. SHERMAN. There is but one point
of difficulty. The Senate conferees proposed
to recede from the amendment in regard to the
pay of members, but found that that was not at
all in the way ; that could be laid out of view ;
the only difficulty is in regard to the question
of bounties. The House insist upon some
legislation being had in regard to the bounties,
and their conferees submitted a proposition
which we did not feel at liberty to accept. I
will say that the proposition submitted is much
more moderate and much more reasonable
then any I have yet seen ; but we considered
that the action of the Senate did not leave us
at liberty to accept it.
