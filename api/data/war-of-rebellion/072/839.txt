*Original received and filed in the War Department August 31, 1891, too late for insertion in its proper order. This journal, together with a journal of the Franklin and Nashville Campaign (to appear in Vol. XLV), was sealed up immediately after the battle of Nashville and was not opened until it was received at the War Department. The officer who compiled it had not, therefore, an opportunity to revise or read it over. It is published just as written during the daily progress of the campaign.
