Lieutenant Jenkins took command of Company I, Second Colorado Cavalry. The Indians moved in a southwest direction; they had some two miles the advance; we pursued them to the Arkansas River, the last two miles at full speed to the bank of said river, and came close enough to empty eight saddles, a portion of the Indians floating down the river, killing and wounding at least fifteen Indians. We killed or wounded three Indians on the south bank with carbines from the north side. Drove them from the river and stationed twenty men on the bank of the river with carbines to protect my men in crossing. Lieutenant Jenkins led the way across the river, followed by thirty-five men. After they had crossed over I joined them, leaving twenty men at the crossing in charge of Sergeant Bown, of Company I, Second Colorado Cavalry, to await our return. We crossed without much difficulty by swimming a portion of the way; went south some three miles; found that we could not overtake them in any reasonable distance; returned to this station with my command. Lieutenant Jenkins and men under my command did nobly, and were ready and willing to do everything that was possible for them to do. Inclosed you will find copy of Lieutenant Jenkins' report. *

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ELISHA HAMMER,
