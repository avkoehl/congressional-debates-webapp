Major-General BURNSIDE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

Please have the requisition for sand-bags made through Lieutenant Benyaurd, engineer, who is on duty with the engineer company on your front. The commanding general considers it better to have the requisitions go through the regular channel. An engineer officer will be at once ordered to your staff in place of the officer relieved.
