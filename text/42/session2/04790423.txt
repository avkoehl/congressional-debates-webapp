expenditures.
How did the money go ? This really embraces
both of the considerations which I propose to
present; for the money that has been received
into the Treasury has gone partly in paying
the running expenses, and upon the national
debt, interest, and principal.
First, the annual expenditures. Let me take
the same years that I have gone overin examin-
ing the taxation,'beginning, in' 1865, with the
year en ding July 1; 1866, Th^treniendons ex-
penditures of the war years give no standard
for a fair comparison, so 1 do not go back to
that time. Here are Ihe expenditures entire,
including payment of interest upon the nationa
debt, for the six years ending July 1, 187l:

The table is worth studying, bearing in mind
the proposition that I have before advanced,
that the Republicah party is not responsible for
the expenditure of the public money, as it did
not have control of the executive department
of the Government until March 4, 1869.
The expenditure for 1868, the lastyearof
Mr. Johnson, when he was most nearly ia fel-
lowship with the Democratic party, was over
$20,000,000 larger than in 1867, while the
first year of the present Administration, when
the Republican party fir§t since the war had
entire control of both executive and legisla-
tive departments of the Government, shows a
<lpcreaseof$54,506,000, followed byadecrease
of $13,000,000 for 187.0, and §14,500,01)0 for
1871 and 1872.
I should be glad if I had the. tinae to go into
an analysis of the last yearns expenditures,
showing item by item what h^ beeonje of the
money. The chairman of the Committee on
Appropriation! [Mr, Garfield] has-done that
already so , admirably that i quote from a
gpeech made by him on this floor on the 23d
of last January:
" It will be seen that I have placed in the first
group all those items of expenditure, exclusive of
{be ptineipkl of the imfciic debt, Whieh a?e paid
<Jirec*,iy for (expends of the late war. These items
'explain t^epaselves, and arno.uM to $175,543,140 27.

ftfid naval expenses of the Government, exctadin#

rivers, which ia properly a ciyil expenditure, and
also excluding payments for the late war, which
belong; to another group,
MIn |he third group, I hare pljwed the civil ex-
penditures proper—all that does not belong to the
first two groups. From this tabfeitappeara that of
the expenses during the past year, sixty and a half
per qent* of the whole amount, leaving out the pay-
ment of the principal o f the public debt, was directly
for thelatG war; fourteen per cent, was for the sup-
port of our Army and Navy, a«d twenty-five and a
half pef oeat. ior all the other departments of the
Government. Or. stated now summarily, sixty and
a half per cent, of all our exp^nditures%f last year
was for the late war, and thirty-nine and a half
per cent, foe current expenses.

-aiinUar analysis of the expense* of the British
Government fo.r tue p^§t year, in a table which I
pave compiled from official reports, making the same
three groups for the expenditure* ot that country as

' last—i'he national debt.
It is 9, war debt incurred to save the Repub-
lic from destruction by armed rebellion, aad
for this reasoa is generally accepted by the
people as an obligation to be manfully dis-
charged by full payment. It was the price paid
for union and enduring peace; and yet Mr.
Buchanan, the last of ihe hue of Democratic
Presidents, did quite a handsome business in
iaying the foundation of the present national
debt. Igivetkenet revenue for three fiscal

Mr. Buchanan had to borrow, in these three
years of profound peace, over fifty million doi-
But these figures sink into insignificance
■when compared with those which we are ac-
customed to contemplate in considering our war
debt proper. I only give them place in order to
call the. attention of gentlemen on the other
.side of this House to the fact that _ their last
representative in the executive chair ran the
country in debt at ths rate of $17,000,000 a
year in a time of peace. We hear a good deal
from these gentlemen about impTovicjgnce, ex-
travagance, and corruption unfler thepresent
Administration. There may have been neither
of these under Mr. Buchanan, "but if ppt, it is
difficult to see where the money spent went to.
The national debt of the United States on
the 1st day of- March, 1869, including accrued
interest, and deducting cash in the Treasury,
was $2,525,403,260 01. "the exact amount at
the end of, the war, or St the end of the fiscal
year ending July, 1868,.cannot told with
accuracy. It probably attained ita maximum
at that time, for by that time the floating in-
debtedness had either been paid off by money
derived from loans, or such temporary indebt-
edness had been changed into some one of the
more permanent forms under which our na-
tional debt has since presented itself. But it
is safe to say that up to March 1, 1869, com-
paratively little had been done to reduce the
bonded debt of the country. The taxes, under
the control of the Republican party, irere, as i
have showed, being reduced eyery year, and
the expenditures under Mr. Johnson had not
been subjected to that revision and curtail-
ment that has marked the course of his suc-
cessor. The result was that the national debt
of the country on March 1, 1869, wag about
$13,000,000 only less than it was in 1866r in
all, more than $2,500,000,000. The Repub-
lican party found the country thus burdened
when the war ceased. Its magnitude appalled
the stoutest hearts ; it mortgaged every piece
of property in the country; it oppressed with
doubt the future; it gave rise to theories
which, bad as they were, yet attracted all
those who lacked a fitting sense of public
honor, as well as the demagogue who sought
to play upon this feeling for his .own advance-
ment. This bias toward repudiation nearly
broke down our credit abroad-, tesded to un-
settle business at home, and to keep gold at a
high premium. With aj{ its other herculean
labors the Republican party grappled with
this also- It struggled along through the
years of Andrew Johnson's administration,
lacking the control of tbe public Treasury
and of its administrators, and succeeded, while
it was reducing taxation at every session of
Congress, in keeping the national debt firmly
in hand with a tendency toward reduction.
What is the record since the accession of
General Grant to the Presidency? The debt
as I have given it March 1, 1869, was $2,525,-
403,260 01, and the reduction commenced at
once. In the first month the debt was reduced
$266,798 27 ; in the second $6,309,070 65, and
in no month sine, then has the reduction fallen
below $2,000,000, while it has reached as high
a figure as 3j!17.034,123 74 in tbe month end-
ing August 1, 1870,-and S20,208,772 04in the
month ending July 1, 1870. Doriog the m<with
ending April 30, 1872, the reduction was
§15,481,968 64.
Nor has there been anything spasmodic or
sensational in all this. Jt is gratifying to see
how even has been the cutting down of this
great national mortgage. In the first year of
Mr. Boutwe'l's administration of the Treasury
Department the reduction reached $87,134,-
702 84;- at the end of the second year, ending
March 1, 1871, S204,7-54.413 09; at the end
of the third year, last March, 1872, §209,649,-
702 08. or an average yearly decrease of slaaost
$100,000,000. Up to last April 1. there had
been paid off since March 1, 1869, the great
amount of $315,131,730 67.
And this involved a saving of monthly
payment of interest of $1,707,046, which in
one year would amount to $20,484,$52, a
sum larger than all the anuuaj expenditures
of the national Government, fifty years  go.
There is nothing like it in all history, 'i he
resources of our people have sarprised the
world, and these resources have been so applied
