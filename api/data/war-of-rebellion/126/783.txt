PAYMENTS.

The principal business of this branch, with its division and subdivisions as heretofore described, may be divided into the two classes - payments of employes and payments of all other accounts. All persons employed by provost-marshals and acting assistant provost-marshals-general, with the exception of commissioned officers and enlisted men, are paid monthly on receipt rolls, or on vouchers in cases where it has been found impracticable to bear their names on the receipt roll for the month in which the services were rendered. The rates of pay allowed the several grades of employes of this Bureau are as follows:
