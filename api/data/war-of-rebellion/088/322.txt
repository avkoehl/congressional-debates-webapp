Lieutenant-Colonel COMSTOCK,

City Point:

Bridge will be ready at 8 p. m. There are two approaches on the north side of river - one very steep, directly up the hill, the other round the base of the bluff; the last fit for artillery and wagons, the first entirely practicable for infantry. I would suggest that General Hancock send a staff officer to direct the wagons and artillery by the latter road, and if the former gets choked it will entirely block the column by that route.

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., August 19, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

Have you positive evidence of the presence of Picket's division anywhere on your front? I ask because General Halleck telegraph that evidence which has heretofore proven reliable reports the whole of Longstreet's corps moving from Culpeper into the Valley. I know Field's division is here.
