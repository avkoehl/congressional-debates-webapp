Lieutenant Colonel J. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I send a dispatch* just received from Lieutenant-Colonel Crowningshield. I have sent orders to the lieutenant-colonel to follow slowly the cavalry that was on the River road, to cross over and act as reserve. Major Fry just received rations and ammunition; as soon as possible he will relieve Lieutenant-Colonel Crowninshield with his force, and be able to move more readily, his force not having been used to-day.

The loss is very slight on our part of the line to-day. Five killed and 20 wounded. I have no report from Fort Stevens hospital, as the Sixth Corps have taken it for their hospital. We hear now rapid and heavy firing of artillery and musketry in the direction of Forts Stevens and De Russy. Our forces are driving the enemy.
