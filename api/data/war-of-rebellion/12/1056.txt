He said that all Southern men regarded it as they would a direct insult offered to their mothers, sisters, and wives. General Cobbs brigade is in the fi~ont, where the skirmishing is con- stant. He was well dressed, and bore no appearance of privation or discouragement. I will venture to state the impressions made upon my mind by the interview. They are these: That the rebels are in great force at Richmond, and mean to fight a general battle in defense of it; that the Confederate leaders have not the power to control the move- ment which they have inaugurated; that there is little hope of recon- S struction so long as the rebels have a large army in the field anywhere; that it may be found necessary in particular States, if not in all, to destroy the class which has ct~eated this rebellion, by destroying the institution which has created them.
