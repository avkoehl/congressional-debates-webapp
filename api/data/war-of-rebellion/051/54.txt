HEADQUARTERS RIGHT WING, ARMY OF TENNESSEE,Near Mission Mills, September 22, 1863-6 a. m.

Lieutenant Colonel GEORGE WILLIAM BRENT:

COLONEL: Under the construction of your order to move a division to the front this morning upon the Chickamauga and Chattanooga road, I have ordered General Cheatham, who commands my extreme right, to put himself in motion upon that road. It crosses the Chickamauga Creek at the Shallow Ford. He had instructions to press forward until he finds the enemy, with his sharpshooters well advanced to the frond. General Anderson's division is upon the Mission Mills and Chattanooga road, and Walker is to his left, covering another parallel road with a good gap, and Hill, should it be necessary, could cross at a gap between the gap on Walker's road and Rossville.

Respectfully, colonel, your obedient servant,

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
