THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

light of facts like these, as before the touch of the
Savioui The book will be read by the gentle-
man 's own constituents has he any objection > I
wish to send this information into las own dis-
trict, dare he not let it in ' or does he desire them
to remain so blind as njt to see the light of the
noonday sun' How many copies will these
twenty thousand give to each State' Just seven
handled and sixty nine Seven hundied and
sixty-nine copies to a whole State ' This lllumm-
atioi , I should imagine, was partial enough to
suit his views Sir, I would, if I had my will,
gather the light of these documents into a focus so
bnght and so hot that every Dutchman in Mary-
land and Pennsylvania might light his pipe with
it [A Hugh ] But the gentleman cannot bear
even twilight, the glimmerings of a dark lantern
are too much for him Twenty thousand copies
aie too many' He cannot bear even light that
strong' For myself, I would multiply it like the
primers and the "atechisms and the religious
tracts are multiplied by the societies, and I would
put a copy into the hands of every babe in poli-
tics, fiom Maine to Geoigia Yes, sir, from
JV/ut/ie Give the truth fair play, and it will woik
like leaven, till it leavens the whole lump
But, sn, the gentleman branched off fiom the
punting of these documents into a discussion of
the sub-Treasury system [Mr W here lllus-
tiatcd this digression by some remarks w Inch
seemed to amuse those members seated near him,
but which the repoitei was not able to catch ]
The gentleman tolls us that when we can dispense
with all officeis to collect our revenue, then de-
falcations will be a good aigument against that
scheme Sn, we are not duven to any such ab
suidity We apply these facts of defalcation to
the ti ue and legitimate use, wc say, th tt since we
must ha\e men to collect the íevenue, u is highly
important tint they be honest men and tint to
makethi m sub ricisureis,and thtnindulge tin m
in default after default, and still keep them in
office, is not a likely way to make them honest
And fuithei, we say, that if such are tht fiuits
even unde the pet bank system, they will be still
worse undei a sub Tieastuy And we point to
these as the natuial conscquerces of such a sys-
tem, and as the stiongest aigumert against its
being peipetuated Can the gentleman see no
connection' And yet fuithtr, w e s ly, that, adopt
what system you please, unless you place hon-
cster men than honest Levi at the head of your
Treasury, the system must totter and fall There
is the application we make of these fids, and
theie is the argument for punting not only twenty
thousand copies of this document, but a fai
gi eater numbei Sn,the people will undo stand
the argument, though the gentleman fiom Mai y
land cannot We do not want tins publication
meiely to show the countiy that one sheep Ins
gone astray No, su, it is not in politics as in
íeligion there we aie told the good shephetd
leaves the ninety and nine sheep who have not
gone astriy, and goes ifter the pooi stity sheep,
but heie it is just the ítveise I want to stick by
the ninety and nine, holding the straying of one
as an mdnation that if we do not look out, the
íest will follow I would hold them together till
1 have removed the scab from the whole of them
Yes, sir, I would wash tnem thoioughly—not
white wash them, Mi Speakei, [hughtei]—uid
} et I have my teais that washing would kill some
of them, [loud hughtei ] Sir, it would be as
much dieaded by them as by a dog with the hy
drophobia [Laughter] Sn, I would spread the
alaim, and spread it m time When I see a dog
i tinning swiftly along, with his head cove led with
foam and his eyes looking gieen and glassy, I
am for ciymg " mad dog '" that eveiybody may
be on their guaid If we have lepers in the com-
munity, I will cry out, as others appioach, " un-
clean ' unclean'" I have been laising that ciy
for years, you would not believe me, but now you
all see the truth, for the leprosy has broken out
into a running soie I admit that each defaulter
is answerable for his own oftense, but I hold Mr
Woodbury answeiable foi them all, he knew of
their cnmes, and kept them still in office Give
me this document, that I may show that to the
nation
But, lest this debate continue forever, I will
now attempt to bung it to a close by moving
the------
Mi  STAiNLY asked Mr Wise not to move
the previous question, but allow him to say a few
words in reply to the gentleman behind him, [Mr
Atherton ]
Mr WISE consented, on condition that Mr
Stanly would himself make the motion
Mr STANLY said he would vote for printing
these documents, for the reason that they will
give light to the people of his district It is light
only that the people of our country want, that
they may be induced to assist those who are now
struggling to wrest power from the hands of the
"spoilsmen " I took these documents home
with me, after the adjournment in July last, and
read extracts from them to my constituents, and
they listened to them with surprise Even those
who had heietofoie supported this Administra-
tion, and that which immediately preceded it, re-
solved 1 eicafter not to believe men who could so
shamefully abuse their confidence They had
heai dchiiges of this sort before from Whig news-
papers, but weie told they weie false But now
the evidence came fi om the Secretai y of the Treas-
ury himself, they could doubt no longer There
are six counties in my district, Mi Speaker, and
theie is but one copy of Document No 297 in the
district I appeal to the generosity of the gen
tleman from Maryland, and ask him not to íefuse
to so large a portion of the people of this country
the infoimation winch this document will give
them There are some in my district who still
think General Jackson was sincere and correct
when he told the country that he " turned none
but knaves out of office, and put none but honest
men in " I want these men to see how these
" honest" receivers have taken care of the peo-
ple's money, and how much mistaken the old
General was
Mi Speikei, theie was much said by the gen
tleman from Mat y land [Mi I iioma1-] which called
for íeply, but which has been answered by the
gentleman from Virginia [\Ir Wisl] who lias
justtaken hisseat Ihatgentleman[Mi Thomas]
Ins said, su, tint thei weie defaulteis ' of all
poli leal parties " It may be that there ire Whig
defaulters, but how they came into office undei
th.s Admimstiation is matter of astonishment to
me, fori have been lepeatedly solicited, since I
have been a membei of this House, to sign íec
ommendations for applicants for office, (and íec
ommenilations, too, written by some who hold
stats in a body said to be higher and more digni-
fied than this,) and the reason assigned, above
all others, m favor of the applicant, has been that
he is " a genuine Demociat " " Defaulting
Wings," therefore, must have obtained office be
foie this form of lecommendation became fash-
ionable, and aie pi obably defaulters m some office
woith about ten dollars a ycai — the emoluments
being so small none of the "genuine" wanted it
The gentleman from Maryland says speeches
will answer as well as this document Now, Mr
Speaker, if any Whig membei of Congress should
make a speech, embodying the facts set foith in
these documents, and one of these speeches, pel
eh nice, should find its way into that gentleman's
distuet, win would the Admimstiation papéis
say of it' Would no' the Globe, and the tnou-
Sind bought up piesses of the countiy, say, in
their usual language, that it was ill a " Whig
lie " Why, su, no Locoloco would read it
Butapuolic document comes to them in a dif
ferentfoim—fiom the Administration paity, fiom
an executive officei—the people cannot but hear
it, and " out of then own mouths" will thty be
condemned
Mi Speakei, the gentleman from New Hamp-
shi-e [Mi A-ihli ro\] said, in reply to the le-
maiks of the gentleman fiom Mississispi, that
theie was no need of buying a stalling to teach
him to ci y " conupuon' couuption'" in the ears
of the people of this countiy, and the gentleman
fiom New Hampshne seemed to intimate that
those who thus cry out " corruption'" weie but
starlings, taught to use words without meaning
Mr Speaker, this maybe so, but, sn, theie aie
vauous kinds of political starlings Those who
thus cry out " corruption, corruption, corrup- >
tion," are starlings foi the great body of the
American people, these coiruption-crymg btai-
lings were taught by respectable constituents to
sing this note They are Stirling , sir, for a noble
lion But, sir, there is another class whose office
is not quite so respectable These are stai lings
of a paity whose constant occupation has been to
smg that they were the true Republicans, and all
opposed to them "Aristocrats." Yes, sir, there
aie starlings of a caucus, too; of a midnight cau-
cus, whose office it is to introduce resolutions
upon slavery, which may be mterpieted one way
at the South, and another way at the North,
which condemn abolition when it comes with one
" view," butjustify it when it ha3 not" the views
aforesaid," resolutions which
" palter with us m a doable sense,
That keep the word of promise to the ear,
And break it to the hope "
Resolutions which comemthe spmtof Joab,when
he said to Amasa, "Art thou in health, my broth-
er '" and stabbed him under the fifth rib, resolu-
tions which agree to lay petitions for the abolition
of slavery on the table, but which yield the ques-
tion of reception I see you are uneasy, Mr
Speaker. You may save yourself the trouble of
calling me to order I have said all I intend to
say upon abolition
But, sir, the staihngs There are, sir, other
starlings than those I have mentioned 1 do not
intend to be offensive in my language to any gen-
tleman, but only to repel the charge that those
who cry out " corruption" against this Admin-
istration are merely repeating words without
meaning, and making charges without sufficient
evidence Our Secietary of the Treasury may
have his starlings, too, and if he has, sir, I can
only say with Pope, " What must bo the priest,
when the monkey is a god '"
As a quotation has been made from something
that has been formeily said in the British Parlia-
ment, I suppose it is lawful to quote what has
been said on this floor as an offset At the last
session, Mr Speakei, an eloquent gentleman from
Pennsylvania [Mi Biddle] said something about
staihngs You remember it, no doubt, Mr.
Speaker, foi few here have heard that gentleman
without wishing to rcinembei what he said. I
intend only to apply his íemarks to that race of
politicians who aio crying out " Abolitionist"
against all who ditferfiom them politically He
told us, sir, that the stalling was a " gentle and
interesting bird Rather aie wc reminded of a
filthy pairot, hung out in fiont of a sailor board-
ing house, taught by its master to utter exclama-
tions at each passer by, and never joyous or happy
unless when engaged m sci earning out rogue or
strumpet " So I am reminded of this parrot
whenever I hear this cry of " Abolitionist' Abo-
litionist ' Aristocrat' Aristocrat'"against all who
think for themselves, and dare to differ with this
Administration
We aie told, sn, that there has been no corrup-
tion in this Administration. I am at a loss to
conceive what gentlemen call corruption I ask.
those who say theie has been no coriuption^if
they heard the speech of the gentleman fiom
Virginia [Mr Wise] the other day' The gen-
tleman's presence restrains me from speaking of
that speech in the language of commendation
which it merits I ask the Representatives from
Newllampahneif any of them heard thatspeech,
when the House was considering the motion of
the gentleman from NewYoik, to appoint a com-
mittee to ex-mime Mi Swartwout's defalcation '
(By the way, Mr Speaker, I suspect we have
htaid the last of that for this session. I do not
believe the party intend to have any examination
of that matter ) I ask those who say theie was
no corruption, if they heard the remarks of either
the gentleman from Virginia, [Mr Wise,] or the
painful speech of the gentleman fiom Mississip
pi, [Mi   Prentiss ]
I ew of the paity would listen to speeches of
this character, sir, I know—speeches not meiely
abounding m biting saicasmand galling invective,
but well supported by facts, undemed, undenia-
ble facts, from public documents Theie were a
ftw who listentd to tht speech of the gentleman
ftom Vngima, foi, aftei candlelight, I thought I
saw some behind your chan,sir, in the dark,
gnashing tl tir teeth
I ask the gentleman from New Hampshire,
[Mi Aiulricj,] who won for himself last ses-
sion the name of ' Advocate General" of the Sec-
íetaiy of the Tieasury, what he has to say to ail
these charges' Once, I remember, a gentleman
fiom South Caiohna, [Mi Pickens,] whom now
consideied as an ally of the A.dmimstration, said
on this floor, the Secretaiy of theTreasury ought
to have a schoolmaster to teach lum giammai and
