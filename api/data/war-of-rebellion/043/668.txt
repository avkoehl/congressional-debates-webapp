Numbers 225. Reports of Brigadier General Alfred T. A. Torbert, U. S. Army, commanding First Brigade.
HDQRS. FIRST BRIG., FIRST DIV., SIXTH ARMY CORPS,August 3, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to report the following as the part taken by this brigade [Firs, Second, Third, and Fifteenth New Jersey Volunteers] at the battle of Gettysburg, Pa.: On the night of July 1, about 10 o'clock, the brigade started from near Manchester, Md., for Gettysburg. The distance by the route we marched was about 35 miles, and we made it by 4 p. m. on the 2d, only stopping an hour, about 1 p. m. on the 2d, to make coffee. We rested near the battle-field about two hours, when we were ordered to the left of the line, where we arrived about dark, with only 25 men absent, and they came up by the morning. The brigade was held in this position in reserve till morning. Early on the morning of the 3d, the brigade was detached from the corps, and put in position in front and about the center of the line. This position we held till the morning of the 5th. In the meantime the brigade was not actively engaged, excepting on the picket line, where there were 11 enlisted men wounded, and during this time the brigade was under the orders of Major-General Newton, commanding First Corps. Much credit is due to Lieutenant-Colonel Wiebecke, Second Regiment New Jersey Volunteers, in charge of the picket line, and also Lieutenant [Howard H.] Goldsmith, additional aide-de-camp [his assistant], for their good management of the same on July 3.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. T. A. TORBERT,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
