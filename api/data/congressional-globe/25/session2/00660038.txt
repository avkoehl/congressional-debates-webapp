CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
ciely, and by gross misrepresentations, but it would
go upward and spread, and Mr C told a distin-
guished Senator four years ago, while discussi ng
another subject, that the spirit of abolition would
spring up in the North, and however much he, and
others like him, were opposed to the doctrine, it
would one day spread so as to drive him from pub-
lic life, or compel him to yield to its dictates
The Senator from Kentucky had insisted that
receiving petitions implied considering, discussing,
deciding upon them. But m what situation would
all this put the Southern States ? It would convert
the halls of Congress into places for the discussion
of abolition Mr. C did not a k how the North
would be affected, his object was to keep the South
united on this subject, with a susceptibility always
alive. They must first preserve themselves, for
this was a question involving the very existence of
the whole South. Their next object was tn pre-
serve the Union; and there was no other course
for them to do this but by a united and firm resist-
ance to the<e encroachments, and the earlier the
better, for the country was sounder to day than it
would be to-morrow, and delay would leave it to
proceed from worse to worse
Mr C expressed these sentiments on no sec-
tional ground , he would prevent, by what he had
suggested, the destruction of the Umo-i. Tne mea-
sure proposed by Mr. Clay, he tnought, would tail
of its object, and he considered the reverse mode
the best
Mr CLAY said he looked to the whole Union,
and not to any one pait or section more than
another But he had no such despondencies as the
Senator from South Carolina, as to the effects of
the slave, or any other conceivable question, on the
Union He had no fears for the Union, but he
had a desire to tranquillize every part, and give no
just cause of complaint ti anv poitn n Vh"
question was no' the same as to slav ery in tu3 D s-
tnct and slavery in the States. But what ques'ion
was that in human affairs, so weak or so strong,
that it could not be apptoached by argument and
reason? This country would, in every emergency,
appeal to its enlightened judgment, and its spirit of
union and harmony, and the appeal would not be
unsuccessful Mr C remembered that, when the
public mmd was su k with discussions on the late
war, he had said to an illustrious man, now no
moie, We must stop this everlasting discussion,
this endless dip'omacv, lot us "o to wor', and ap-
ped to the v ilci < f i ui < if I men > ■■ is ¡in ns

Mr Cla\ hid no tear fo-the Union, and if the
Senator from South Caiohna would propose a joint
lesolution of the two Hiuses, that the mm «ho
expressed a doubt in legaid to its stability should
be immediately called to orler anJ stopped, it
would obtain Mr C's hearty concurrence The
Union would last, he hoped, forever Mr C's ob-
ject was merely to preserve the Union in its true
pint, and separate tanaticism from those who
were capab'e of listening to reason There would
be no loss of ground by arguing, and that cause
was a bad one which did not admit ol reasoning
upon it
But there was anothet recommendati n to the
course which Mr C proposed, it would satisfy
then own consciences.
Let us show our reasons (said Mr C ,) and
then, if we fail, we shall at least have acquitted
ourselves of our duty The best course was that
pursued by the Government dow n to tw > vears ago,
in which these petitions were often sent to the Dis-
trict Comm ttee, and there allowed to slpep, or as
was sometimes done, followed by reports L"t
such reports now go the North, Mr. t knew si li-
limente in favor of the Un on were not less -r-
dently felt there than elsew here
Mr. CALHOUN said there were cases in wInch
reasoning and argument «ere botn absurd aid
cowardly. If a man shoul I call him a írgup,
should hestoptoargue the point? The entre things
which were to be met not with rearo ng, but wuh
ustant indignation Suppose a petition were sent
here to burn the manufactories of the Xoith would
the Senator stop to reason «about such a petition?
Or that the property of the rich should be given to
the pool, ñor-Id he reason about that?
The petitions proposed abolition m the District
of Columbia, but on what ground'! That Congress
were bound to receivp petitions in all cases, to dis-
cuss and decide uj>on them But if they were
bound to do so m regard to the District, Mr C
would ask the Senator if the same rule would not
hold in reference to the Stales Were they bound
to receive petitions for abolition in the States'* [Mr
C waited for a reply ] If not, he resumed, then the
right did not exist at all The universal sen'i-
ment with the abolitionists was, that abolition in
the District was the first step to abolition in the
States Every abolitionist would say so. The
first step would be m the District, the next would
be to destrov the trade between the States, making
the slaves serfs to the soil, and then an attempt
would be made to abolish slavery in the States
What, then, would be the situation of the South'!
Congress would then discuss their right to proper-
ty guarantied to them by the Constitution, and the
Southern man who would permit it thus to be drawn
into discussion, sacrificed the rights of the South
Mr C was in favor of the Union as much as
others, but unlike the Senator from Kentucky, he
was not in favor of silence when be saw danger
approaching To discern and to announce it was
the be«t way to avoid it The North were not
well informed on this subject.
Mr CLAY remarked, in reply, that the Sena-
tor had put extreme cases He might just as well
havs supposed the abolition of the christian reli-
gion, as the abolition of slavery out of the District
But did he not see that his argument went against
receiving all petitions, as much as Mr Clay's was
in favor of receiving all without distinction' The
p ><\er of Coi "-less to ibohsh slaveiy in the Dis-
trict was belli ved to e\wt, an 1 Coi sries¡, had deter-
mined, by then action, that it was right to receive
petitions on the subject Was that to be con-
founded with a case where Congress had certainly
no power?
Mr C regrettel that they could not agree His
object was to discover a healing measure, and he
thought his couise the truest one
Mr CUTHBEET replied to the argument of
Air Cuy, that it would be the simplest method
to allay this excitement, by receiving the petitions
and giving them consideration, and maintained that
that argument w is to be deprecated, for it would
cause debatt, and raise up a fury of discussion.
Aignnent (said Mr C ) teaches what it ought to
put an end to, it foments what it is intended to
allay He solemnly appealed to the Senator from
Kentucky to maintain his character of peace-
makei In former situations he (Mr Clay) had
been obliged to relent the severity oí his princi-
ples, and to compromise with the South Having
first been a gr<-nd disturber in his manufactunng
zeal, he had been foiced to become a grand pacifi-
catoi,he begged him (M Clay) not to d-pait now
from the principle of p"** Ication
Mr WALL having intiodueed the memorial,
would say a few words on the subject before the
ques'ion to tayon the table was put Mr W then
proceeded to vindicate the chancter of the peti-
tioners They were not he observed, fanatics,
thovwere reasonable sensible and temperate men,
and though he (Mr W ) did not igree with them
and though he was ready to say that the prive of
the petition ought to be rejected, yet he w as not pre-
pared, as the gentleman from South Carolina, (Mr.
Cilhoun,) to say that his constituents should come
to the dror, and that then it should be shut in their
f ice1' The r ght of pet tion belonged to the peo-
ple, and the dutj of consideration and rcsoectful
attent on to all the petitions of all c tizens of every
kind belonged to Congress, as a portion of the Go-
vemmen, to the people belonged the light, and to
the Government appertained the duty of consider-
ing and at ending to that ri-h' The right of peti-
tion woo Id interfere with no other rights The
Sou h was not rendered insecure in its righ s, by
Hi iiitiijg to the North the erjovment of its com-
mon and natural rights Mr W mvisted that re-
sort should be had to reason and to argument, in-
stead of putting down the i ght of petition by vio-
lence and contempt. If the South seeks to stop
the mouths of the North, and prevent petitions
from being heard, by so doing they raise a force
and arouse an eneigy which cannot be put down.
The right of petitioning is a very different thing
from the abolition question, and it is this right
which is now at issue
Mr W entreated the gentleman from the South
not to complícale this question, so important to
hem, by bringing on 10 the other side the question
of the right of petition, by changing the issue, and
setting themselves in opposition to the most sacred
rights of the people
He (Mr W.) had no desire to louch one hair of
the nghjsof the South, the petitioners felt the same,
but they thought Congress coald and ought to in-
terfere on the question of the slave trade in the
District of Columbia
This was a question which admitted of argument
and ought to receive calm consideration. He dif-
fered with them on the question, but could not see
how they cou'd be debarred of the right of being
heard by their servants and representatives, sent
here expressly to do justice to all, and to maintain,
not to put down, the rights of the people
Mr BUCHANAN said, he did not rise for the
purpose of entering upon a genera! discussion of
this question He thought it had alreadj been am-
ply disc issed on foimer occasions, and that a fur-
ther discussion of it at this time was to be depre-
cated Th  subject was now fully understood by
the people He thought the debate which had
taken place this day m the Senate would do much
injury, and tend to revive the nritalion and ex-
citement throughout the country, which this ques-
tion was so well calculated to produce
During the session of 1835-6, he had presented
a petition from a portion of the Society of Friends,
r qiest n<*Conetess to abolish slavery m the Dis-
trict oí Cdluiibn A id he-e, n jus ice to that re-
spectable society, he must observe, that so far as
he was acquainted with them in his own neighbor-
hood, although they were decidedly opposed to
slavery in the abstract, they were not abolitionists
is that tetm was now generally understood The
Senator from South Carolina, (Mr Calhoun,) had
then objected to the reception of this petition Up-
on the question, " Shall the petition be received,"
the constitutional right of petition was distinctly
raised After a long-, powerful, and interesting de-
bate, in which he (Mr B ) had exerted his best ef-
forts to sustain th s right, the petition was received
by the Senate, by a vote of 36 to 10 The consti-
tutional right of petition was thus solemnly recog-
nised by the Senate
After this pet tion had thus been received by the
Senate, he (Mr B ) had made a motion to reject
the prayer of the petition Tnis opened a discus-
sion upon the question, Shall slavery be abolished
m the District of Columbia or not? After a long
debate, it was decided in the negative only six Se-
nators voting against his motion
Now it has been said that this course of proceed-
ing had intrrferred with the right of petition, but
with what justice? Had not these petitions been re-
ceived by a s i'ernn vote of the Senate, and had not
their praver bten deliberately considered, discussed,
and rejected? The light of petit on had been as
cleaily maintained, and the subject had been as
distmctlv brought before the Senate, as if the peti-
tions had been rolerrcd to a comm ttee In the
first p'ace, the pet tions had been rece.ve'', and
then the Senate had decided thit Slavery ought not
to be abolished n the Dis'nct ot Cjlumbia, and
that their prav er ought to be reject"''
After these solemn nrocee linas had ti' en p'ace,
were the Senate bound, whenever a new petition
of i similar chancier was presented, again and
a?am, on each succeeding daj to i'iscuss and de-
cide the right of petition?
Thiscours  would have exasperated the feelings
of the people, interfered w ith the transaction of the
business of the country, and must have resulted as
it had resulted before In this situition, the course
was adopted, in the stssion of 1836-7, of moving to
lay the question of the reception of these petitions
upon the table This was the onlj mode of avoid-
ing everlasting deba'e It left the foimer decision
in favor of the right of petition ¡n full force, and
