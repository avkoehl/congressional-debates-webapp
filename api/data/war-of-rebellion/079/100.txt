SMYRNA CAMP-GROUND, October 5, 1864.

Brigadier-General COOPER,

Commanding Second DIVISION:

SIR: The THIRD DIVISION is marching along the railroad to Marietta, and I am very anxious that the trains should reach there also at an early hour. If you have to crossed the railroad when this reaches you, you may put your whole command on the railroad excet one regiment for a rear guard for the trains to follow by the common road. A corps has been stationed at Ruff's Mill (between here and the Sandtown road) to cover this road, which makes it safe. I will either meet you at Marietta or leave orders for you. Try to prevent all straggling and do not hurry your men too much.

Yours,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.
