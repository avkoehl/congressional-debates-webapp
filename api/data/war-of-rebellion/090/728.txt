Major General C. C. AUGUR:

Can the Eighth Illinois Cavalry by spared? I find that the cavalry has been so scattered up here that it is no wonder it has not done well.

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON, 22ND ARMY CORPS,August 8, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Commanding Middle Division, Harper's Ferry:

The Eighth Illinois Cavalry is scattered worse than anything you have-the headquarters of six companies are in General Wallace's department; Major Waite, with four companies, is guarding the Potomac between Great Fals and the Monocacy; another company is near Port Tobacco, and another portion is with the Army of the Potomac. I do not see how Major Waite's command can be spared, as I have no cavalry to replace it. I dont know about that part of the regiment with General Wallace. Will you be at Harper's Ferry to-morrow? If so, I will go, or send to meet you, with a roster of this command, if you wish it.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General, Commanding.
