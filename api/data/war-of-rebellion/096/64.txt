Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR:

The transports were not ready at Baltimore for General Grover and he had to go into camp. This is unfortunate.

Hold the trains of Grover's division for further orders. Transports were reported to have left Fort Monroe two or three days ago for Baltimore, to carry at least 4,000 men.

Major General P. H. SHERIDAN,

On inquiry I find that steamers sufficient to carry about 5,000 men should have been in Baltimore last Tuesday night. The quartermaster is now making inquiries to find where the vessels are.

Lieutenant-General.

BALTIMORE, January 7, 1865

Brigadier-General FORSYTH,

Arrived here at 8 a.m. No transportation is ready, nor will there by any ready before Sunday night. Have gone into camp at Camp Carroll. The chief quartermaster will get the transportation ready as soo as possible. Have you any further instructions?

Major-General AUGUR:

I am instructed to refer following dispatch to you. The major-general commanding desires to know whether you have any information on this subject:

HARPER'S FERRY, [January] 6, 1865

General SHERIDAN:

I understand that large amounts of hay and corn from district in Loudoun County, from which your cavalry must expect to procure their supplies, are being crossed at Edwards Ferry and other points on Potomac out of my district. This, I learn, has been going on for two weeks. Unless General Tyler puts a stopper on it I fear Devin may have trouble for forage. See the work of speculators from Georgetown.

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
