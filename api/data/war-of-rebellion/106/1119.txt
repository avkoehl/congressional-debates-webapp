Montgomery district, in the White Mountains, partly in California and partly in Nevada, and Columbus district, about thirty miles form Montgomery, come within the range of these roving, and the white meant in the vicitity are constantly in danger of losing their lives. The present difficulties and danger which men have to encounter very much check the occupation to these mines and the investments that would be made. There is a place know as Fish Lake, in the vicinity of Montgomery and Columbus district, where excellent grass, water, and timber abound and the climated mild. The Indians resort there a great deal and could be easily controlled from that point by a military force. Perhaps it would be, for the purposes referred to and for a military station, highly eligible; and, in view of the foregoing, we would most earnestly request you, for the protection of life and property, to render such aid as may seem to you consistent, and as readily as may be.
