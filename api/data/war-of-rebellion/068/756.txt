HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 14, 1864-6.30 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The understanding I had was to attempt to carry the enemy's line by surprise at dawn this morning. My inability to get my men here prevented this. My men are gradually coming in, but a large portion will be all day, and are exhausted with fatigue. I do not think they are in condition to fight to advantage. Have you any further directions to give in view of this statement?

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.

You dispatch of 6.30 a. m. is received. The major-general commanding has no further instructions to give except that you report as soon as your force is got together. He desires that you ascertain the position on the Court-House road held by Burnside's troops, and the number of men holding it with a view to your relieving them.

Your are not relieve them without orders.

MAY 14, 1864-7.30 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I have now in position, in hand, Griffin's division about 2,500 Cutler's division, about 1,300, Crawford's division not yet ascertained, Colonel Kitching's brigade not yet ascertained. My staff are all at work. General Griffin is sending out to get possession of an eminence and house to the southwest, which will give us a nearer view of the enemy from that direction. The enemy is taking down his tents deliberately. I have had some men wounded skirmishing. I am getting my artillery in position, it is all up. I had relieved Burnside's dismounted cavalry before I received your dispatch to diminish the confusion about here.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
