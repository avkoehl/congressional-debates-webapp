Ripley and the march back to Corinth I respectfully refer to the accompanying report of General McArthur, who succeeded me in the command.,

In order to give a more distinct idea of the part performed by this division in these important operations, without the statement of too many details, the following brief is added, by way of recapitulation:

October 2. Heavy skirmishing by the Second Brigade, under Colonel Oliver, who had advanced to re-enforce one of his regiments previously stationed at Chewalla, the colonel taking up a position at night near Alexander's Cross-Roads.

October 3. In the morning the enemy's advance attack Colonel Oliver, but is repulsed, after which the colonel, ascertaining that the enemy is in force, falls back slowly, according to his instructions, contesting the ground by severe fighting and destroying bridges until he makes a stand on favorable ground a little in advance of the old Confederate intrenchments, where he is re-enforced by the First Brigade, under General McArthur, who takes command at that point, for the purpose of relieving the Second Brigade, already considerably exhausted by severe duty. The road leading in from Chewalla runs through the line occupied by the Second Division, commanded by General Davies, and one of his brigades (Baldwin's) now co-operates in holding the advance position. After several unsuccessful attempts to turn the left the enemy pass to the right and throw their entire force upon the Second Division, which is forced back, and McArthur's command, being turned, is obliged to retire again to a new position, which is taken near the main line north of the railroad, facing north, the main line of this division changing front to correspond and the Second being now relieved. The enemy at length appearing again, the First Brigade, together with the brigades of the Second Division, charge, driving him some distance, when this brigade is called in and formed as a second line. The division still holds its position, menacing the enemy's right flank, to give time for a flank movement on his left by Hamilton's division and to delay his advance until the reserve can be posted to support the batteries in his front. These movements accomplished, the Sixth Division at length being ordered to fall back within the interior line of the batteries, the enemy again appears and commences a furious attack after the division has commenced moving, but is repulsed after a severe action by Colonel Crocker, commanding the Third Brigade, and the division moves in good order and takes a position at sundown within the line of defenses without the los of a gun, having during the day received the first attack of the enemy 8 miles west of Corinth, and having disputed and delayed his advance until after the division on the right was forced by overwhelming numbers to give way, and holding its position on the enemy's flank, assisting in retarding his advance on the batteries until it was too late for him to make an assault on the evening of this day, and finally, when ordered to fall back to the inner batteries, and the enemy again attacks the division while on the march, it halts to beat him back, and marches into position within the defenses in good order.

October 4. In addition to severe skirmishing in front the division co-operating with the siege batteries repulsed the enemy in two attempts to force the works on College Hill, and after the battle the division participated in the pursuit of the enemy as far as Ripley, and on leaving that place to return to Corinth the rear guard was furnished by this division.

As far as my personal observation extended the conduct of the
