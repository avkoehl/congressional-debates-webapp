Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

This morning our skirmishers reoccupied the hill north of Dutch Gap, from which the enemy had been driven by our gun-boats. This afternoon the left of our line north of James River advanced against the enemy's right to discover his strength and position; drove in his skirmish line, and finding him strongly intrenched withdrew. About noon the enemy in front of Petersburg moved his Fifth Corps toward the Weldon railroad, when he was met by General Heth, who drove him a mile, capturing 150 prisoners.
