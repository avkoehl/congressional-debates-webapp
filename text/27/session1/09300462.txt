lam the more disposed to rely upon the average result of
this statement because the seven years embrace some of the
most p[Ospeiou3 and some of the moat disastrous known to
our commercial history in times of peace It will be seen that
the fluctuations in different years have been v ery great, ran?*
lag from $107,000,000 to near $190,000,000 But the average
result shows that the whole amount of imports "paying duty"
over and under 20 per cent is only $69,748,000, being a Imíe
less than $70,^00,000, and when all these duties are reduced to
20percent asthey willbeon thefiistday of July next by the
compromise act, then, even supposing all paid that duty, which
all will not, the whole amonnt of gross revenue derived
from this source would be $13,959,000, or less than fourteen
millions of dollars
But even all this, limited and «¡mall as it is, is not available
for the ordinary wants of the Treasury That the committee
may see the amount of drawbacks, deductions, bounties, and
expenses of collection, ail of which ought to be taken into the
account in determining the sett amount of revenue received
into the Treasury, applicable to the ordinary expenditures of
the Government, I beg leave to call their attention to a table, to
be found in document No 31 of this House, of the piesent ses
won, at page 29    This table reads as follows
ÍS$m this table it will be perceived that the av-erage amount
of "actual duties" fjr six years, from 1834 to 1839, inclusive,
was     .         -         ...         -         -823176,000
And the nett amount only    .                                  18,404,000
Making a difference of                                      -   $4,772,000
If the same difference should exist after the first day of July
next, thenfrom these fact  the matter would stand thus
Gross amount of duties        -         -         -         - ^^3,060,^00
Deduct for drawbacks, expenses of collection, <&c.       4,772,000
And it leaves for nett amoint of duties      -          ■   $9,178,000
But I do not conceive this to be precisely the mode of coming
at the difference between the gross and nett amount of duties
as reduced under the compromise act. It is true that the "ex-
penses of collection" will remain the same, as the afficers em-
ployed m the custom house are all salaried officers, whose
compensation is not graduated at all by the amount of revenues
collected And at many ports where there are many officers,
and where they are indispensably necessary—not to col'ect the
revenue, but toprpvpmsmuggling—the whole amount collected
is not sufficient to pay the officers employed The "bounties
on pick'ed fish exported" and the "allowances to vessels em-
ploved m the fisheries" being m nowise dependent on the
amount of revenue received from duties, will also remain the
same, but we may reasonably suppose as the amount of duties
falls off under the compromise act, the amount of "duties re
funded" tinker the decisions of the courts, and the amount of
"drawbacks'J "on foreign merchandise exported," "on do-res
tic refined sugar exported "and"on domesticdistil'ed spirits
exported," will also fall off m something like the same propor-
tion But this cannot be in reference to the drawback on refined
sugar and distilled spirits without some further legislation, for
the drawback on those articles was graduated by the high rate
of duty imposed upon them prior to the compromise act, but
by the operations of that act the duty has been constantly di
mimshing, while the drawback remains the same, so that it now
operates by way of bounty on the manufacture of those articles,
andas a consequence the manufacture ha<* ereatly increased,
being as apoearsfrom the table to which I have referred, more
than double in 1839 what it was m 1838 But this hill is intended
to remedy that evil, and to reduce the drawback to the amount
oftheimportduty.
Trusting that the committee will pardon this digression, I re-
turn again to the question I was considering—what sum =hould
be deducted from the gross amount of duties, estimated under
the compromise act at near $ 14 000 000 to ascertain the nett
amount applicable to the ordinary expenses of the Government?
I had shown that the "expenses of collection"            $1,422000
"Bounty on pickled fish exported"                                 7 000
Allowances to vessels employed m the fisheries      -      256,000
Matin* in all   •          -         -         -         -          - $1,685,000
must remain the same    The remaining items are
Duties refunded                -         -         -  $371,000
Drawbacks on exports                             2,256,000
Drawbacks on refined sugar         -         •     148,000
Drawbacks on distilled spirits      -         -        9,000
Making a total of    ....  3,084,000
The annual average gross amount of du-
ties at that time was       -         •         - 23,000,000
Under the compromise  act it will  he
about                           -                     14 000,000
A lu*Ie lcssthan two third* built-in be
near enough for my purpose to call it two-
thnds
Then one third of W 0^14 000 is $1,035,000, which,
deucted from #3,084,000, leaves                -          -   2 056 000
Which, added to the above, makes    -         -          - $3,741,000
Then, according to this calculation taking the law as it now
stands, and judging of the future by the past, the accountstands
thus

Gross amount of duties after July 1,

Andleavmgan annual deficitof     -         -          -   517,488,000
And this *oo, independent of the public debt created by the
past Administration, and which ought tobe paid off duungtht
present
The revenues will be more than this for the cuirent year, as
the avails of the publir lands are to be paid into the Treasury
until thefiistday of January next, and the reducing effect of
the compromise act, of which I shall have occasion to speak
morí* particularly herearter, will not be so sensibly felt until
the first daj of January and the first day of July next
But it mavbe asked if the amount of arnmng revenues un
dei existing laws are tobe eo small, and the expenditures of
the past Administration have been so great, how havethey been
enabled to meet the demands upon the Treasury?
This is a very natural and fair inquiry, and I therefore anti-
cipate if, with the view of answering it The truth is, that the
past Administration had certain resources and means, which
are either exhausted or upon which we can no longer relv, or
to which we do not desne to resort, from which it deiived the
means of making the expenditures to which I have alluded
A nd I desire to cat! th  attention of the committee particularly
to three particular and extraordinary sources of revenue which
the pist Administration enjoyed, and upon which we can no
loneei depend
The fit¡-t is the amount of mon^y in the Treasury on th* 1st
davof January 1337, and the debts then due the Government
which have been colleued, and the money used, and the amount
borrowed on Treasury notea and used up, which had a double
effect, by increasing the mean* of the past Administration, and
throwing an undue burden upon the presen' The amountof
these means m round numbers was ¿31,310,000, and that the
committee mav see a rl*ar «rtAtementof them, I call their atten
tion to House Doc No 2 of the present session being the''Fi-
nance report at page 5, where they will find the following state
ment on this subjec*
Fiom the year 1816 to 1837, a period of twenty one years? the
revenues constantly exceeded the expenditures.   The aye*
rage annual surplus during that time was $11,464,226 87
(see tables land 2,) making an aggregate excess of 8240.'
748,764 27, Within that time there was applied to the ex.
tinction of the national debt S20f,792127 44, and there was.
Under the provisions of the act of the 23d of June, 1836, del
posited with the States ©28101,644 91, and there remained
on the 1st of January, 1837, in the Treasury of the United
States, including the fourth instalment due to the States^
surplus of                            -                   - 817,109,473 26
There were also outstanding debts due and fall-
ing due to the Treasury, arising from other
sources than those of the ordinary revenue,
and which were paid between the 1st of Janu-
ary, 1837, and 4th of March, 1841, the amount
of (see statement D)               -         -         .     9,124,747 00
There were also issued withm that period, and
outstanding on the 4th of March, 184i,Treasu
ry notes to the amountof                  -         -     5,648,512 40
Making the aggregate available means which
were m the Treasury on the 1st of January,
1837, and which came into it prior to the 4th
of March, 1841, oyer and above the current re-
venues   ......31,882,732 66
From which deduct the amount (less the trust
funds) remainipg in the Treasury on the 4th of
March, 1841      -                                        .        672,718 46
And there appears an excess of expenditure over
the current revenue of *          -          -         • $31,310 014 20
Here then, is an amount of more than $31,000,000 received
and expended by the past Administration from sources where
we have little or nothing to expect. They had in the Treasury,
on the 1st of January, 1837, moie than $17,000,000, all of which
has been expended, and they only left on the 4th of Mai ch last,
as appears by the above statement, thesmall sum of ©572,000, a
sum comparatively too trifling to be worth mentioning
But this is not all We had then due us a large debt for the
sale of our stock in the United States Bank, and of that they
have collected ard expended during the past Administration
more than $9,000,000, and the little balance, if any, that is due
la too trifling to be taken into the account This is also gone
But even this is not all, they borrowed more than $5,000,000
on Treasury notes, and have expended the money, and left the
debt to be paid by the pre ent or some succeeding Administra
tion We have nothing to expect from this source, unless wo
are willing to go on and increase this public debt For one, I
am not, I rather prefer to provide the means to pay it off
Here, then, are &31 310,000 received by the past Administra
tion from sources from which we have nothing to expect, but
m striking the balance between the two Administrations, and
estimating the means that ought to he provided for the present
to put it on a par with the last, we ought to add this Treasmy
note debt to the above sum, which would make it $36,958,000;
for, although we have charged it to their means above, yet it is
to take <?o much from our ordinary means if we pay it; and I
trust we shall
This, then, sir, is one item, and I now call the attention of
the committee to another I mean the avails of the public
lands. As the bill that passed this House dis'rlbutmg them
among the States has not been rejected by the Senate, I feel
bound to assume, and so must this House in estimating for the
wavs and means to cany on the Government that that bill will
become a law, and will, after the 1st day of January next, re 
store the proceeds of these lands to the people of the several
States, to whom they justly belo. g And, in passing, I may be
permitted to say, sir, that I voted for that bill, not as afinancial
measure, but as a matter of right to the States, and as a great
conservative measurt, rendered necessary by the course of
events to preserve this gteatand rich patrimony foi the peo
pie to whom it belongs, and to prevent us heme squandered
and gambled away by trading politicians and reckless dema-
gogues It was fast becoming a sreat corruption fund that It
WaTTfecessary to restoi e to its rightful owner, that it might be
guarded from the corrupt temptations of avarce, and the still
moie baneful and dangerous influences of inordinate and time-
serving ambition I only regret that this could not have been
done at a more auspicious moment for the public Treasury
But the object to be attained was, in my mind, far above any
temporary inconvenience that might arise to the Treasmy,
and, therefore, I gave it a most cordial support
During the four years of the past Administration, there wae
1-aidmto the Treasury from the avails of the public lands,
020,226,000
At page 3, document 2, the Secretary estimates the
amount to be received from the public lands this
year, from March 4th to January 1st, at            -    2,500,000
which, deducted from the receipts of the preceding
four years, leaves            .... $17,726,000
bemgalmost$18,000000 more from this source thar the pre
sent Administration can calculate upon
Butthis is not all There is another source of revenue of
vast importance, which was enjoyed by the past Administra
tion, which is about to be cut off under the opeiation of the
compromise act In order that I may esplain this fully, It is
necessary that I should go something into detail as respects the
provisions of that act We all know that this act was passed
on the 2d of March, 1833, being the final compromise between
constitutional power on one side and nullification on the other
I do not propose to speak of its merits, much less of the merits
of the controversy out of which it grew, and I only intend now
to speak of us provisions so far as they affect the revenueans-
mg from duties.
With the view of reducing all duties to a maximum of 20 per
cent ad valorem, this act provided that, on the 1st day of Janu-
ary, 1834, one tenth of the duties over 20 per cent on all aru>,
cles imported should be taken off, and on the 1st clay of Janu'
ary, 1836 another tenth, and on the 1st day January 1833, an
other tenth, and on the 1st day of January, 1840, another tenth,
and on the lat day of January, 1842, three tenths more, and on
the 1st day of July 1842 the remaining three tenths should be
deducted, so that after that day no article imported should bear
d higher duty than ¿0 per cent ad valorem It will thusbeper
ceived that, under the operations of this act, four tenths @f the
duties above 20 percent have already been deducted, and that
thiee tenths more will be deducted on the 1st day of January
next, and the remaining three tenths on the 1st day of July
nest,
