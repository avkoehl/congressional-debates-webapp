paraphernalia of allowances costs the country, or
what is its value to the officers, and it is doubtful
whether, at lliis time, any department of the Gov-
ernment can inform you what is the exact value
and amount of the pay and allowances per annum
to the general and staff officers of the Army The
practice of brevets, which has obtained exten
sively, seems better adapted to the increase of
pay than to any other object of the service For
instance, a brevet brigadier'general, stationed at
Washington, performing the duty of the head of
the bureau of the engineer corps, may obtain a
salary under a law giving him $104 per month
and twelve rations per day, of §4,515 I do not
take this example from any hostility to the re
spectable gentleman who has. been so foi túnate as
to secure such snug quarters I believe he is a
good engineer, but his engineering is perhaps on
a scale more expensive to the country than the
scale of his salary
These details (said Mr M ) furnish a single
example of how much abuse may be practiced,
under the guise of the public service, if not the
public good They show on the face of them the
necessity of legislative correction, and if the com-
mittee had adhered to their original puipose, I
should have entertained some hope of seeing our
army officers placed on a footing more just to the
true interests of the country and the other branches
of the public service Unfortunately, they have
not done so, and therefore I am for the motion of
the honorable gentleman from Virginia, to com
mit this bill with instructions " to report a bill to
equalize the pay of the Army and Navy," and I
would add a provision to cut off all allowances
Mr Speaker, (said Mr M ,) I come now to
the examination of the dry details of this bill,
and I must isk the indulgence of the House while^
I submit a few considerations against its passage
I will attempt to show that its provisions will
increase the pay and emoluments of the Navy,
except in the highest grades, much beyond the
maximum which the Secretary, or the navy
board, or even its officers themselves, have as
yet asked or desired I willattempt to go fuithei,
sir, and show by comparisons that the present
pay and allowances to the Amencan Navy, ex-
cept in the highest grades, are now, under our
laws and regulations, greater than those of any
other considerable navy in Euiope Some of the
general provisions of this bill, sn, will also claim
our attention The first thing which presents
itself to our attention is usually an unimportant
paitof a bill—its title, "A bill to regulate the pay
of the Navy of the United States " I have been
brought up in the old schools, where I learned tt>
call things by their right names Perhaps I am
behind the intelligence and ingenuity of the age,
but I should call this in plain English " a bill to
met ease the pay of the Navy " When the honor
able gentleman adopted his bill, he must have
been influenced by the doctrine that " a rose by
any other name would smell as sweet " But why
not call it by its true name? Is it to be implied
that its ft lends entertain some fears that it has
rhubarb in its composition' Sir, whatever you
call it, the bill will still be a bill to inciease the
pay oi the Navy, instead of what it should have
been, "A bill to equalize the pay of the Aimy
and Navy
The first item in it seeks to establish a distinc-
tion between officei3 of the same giade by desig-
nating "a semoi captain," or a concealed Ad mi
ral a " commander in-chief" of the Navy 1
confess myself a little jealous of " titles and dig-
nities" undei this Grovernmtnt Peihaps (said
Mi M ) it is owing to a defect of education in
the school to which I have always been attached
Why (said Mi M ) do we piopose to do thing 
foi the Navy undei false coloisl That branch of
the seivice has never given u^ such examples
Their bannei-. have always been boldly hung out,
insciibed With liberty and tiuth
To this " senior captain" le piopose by this
bill to give, when in seivice, a salary, besides
some allowances, of uj,4,500 "When on leave
of absence or waiting ordeis, $3,500 " In re
spect to " all othei captains," the provis ons of
the bill tie similai, except in some contingencies
not likely to occui
The ten captains of the Navy of over fifteen
ycais'standing,  "when at sea," and when at
shore stations, and as navy commissioners, now
receive an average salary of $3,493 72, besides
some other valuable allowances
Is not this enough to satisfy all reasonable de-
mands upon the gratitude of republics > We are
answered in the negative, (said Mr M ,) and to
show us simple republicans how far we are behind
those great and oppressive aristocracies, we are
referred to the precedents of the British and
French navies, communicated to us, to my sur-
prise, by the Secretary of the Navy—not, I am
confident, for our imitation or adoption
In those navies an admiral (" senior officer")
receives from seven thousand five hundred dollars
to nine thousand five hundred dollars, which is
increased nearly fifty per cent when they are on
duty, oi, m other words, the princely treasures
of those kingdoms, "gathered from the mouths
of famine," are opened to the rapacity of those
who hold to the maxim of ' taking care of the
rich, and the rich will take cere of the poor "
These precedents (said Mr M ) cannot have been
placed upon our records as examples for our adop-
tion at the instance of any American citizen, and,
for myself, I cannot permit them to influence my
judgment or action in íespectto any piovision of
this bill To me they are bad precedents, and
the circumstance of then being before us has, in"
no degiee, disposed me in favor of the bill which
uccompamed them
It will be legitimate, however, for me to lefer
to them again, for another purpose Sir, (said
Mr M ,) we aie told that the pay of the officers of
the Navy was established by a law passed in
1799,since which it has not been increased, while
the pay in othei departments of the public sei
vice has been enlaiged,and thisisuiged asaiea-
son why we ought now to show our liberality
with the public tieasure, and increase the pay of
the Navy I am aware, sn, (said Mi M ,) that
our public seivants immediately aboul the Cap
ltol are much in the habit of applying to the lc
gislative power to give' give' and that, in the
better sympathies ot oui nature, we are too apt
to yield to such lmpnitnmtns, foigetting the in-
terests of those multitudes of oui tellow citizens
far removed fiom the scene of our action, but
whose inteiests deseivc the most of our caie It
should not be foigotten (said Mi M ) that in
1799 an Admimstiation existed, under the
elder Adams, m this countiy, that, whatevei
other objections arose against it, it was not
guilty of being m favor of low salaues The
pay of the captains of the Navy was raised
at that critical penod in our history and in
our finances, from $75 to $100 per month, and
it is under that law now, by which these cap-
tains, thiough allowances and perquisites,obtain
the average before stated of $3,493 pei annum,
except that, in 1815, Congiess passed a law to
oiganize the Navy board, and establishing their
pay at $3,500, besides some contingencies
Mi  Speaker, (said Mr M ,) I do not percene
the foice of the reasoning, tnat because you have
raised the pay in one bianch of the seivice, you
must therefoie m«e another, or the whole     If H
admitted, it would lead to raising the pay undei ,
this Government, already, m my judgment, too |
high in eveiy department,  to  a degree which j
would exalt the agent above the principal     The I
officers of the Navy, sir, (said Mr  M ,) in addi-1
tion to pay and emoluments, in time of war are I
entitled  to  pnze money, which  is  usually the]
lion's pait    This  item, dunng the late  wai,
amounted to $1,140,594, divided, according to j
our puze laws, between the gallant officers and
c ews of the vessels so fortunate in captming the
enemy     When we íeflect, again, that thet,e oft
ceis are not called into foieign sea seivice more .
than about one year in five, I am confident the j
countiy will be satisfied that there is no necessity |
for passing this bill   so far, at least, as the thirty-
seven captains of the Navy are concerned
Mi  Speakei, the next item of this proposition
"to íegulate," raises the pay of the  masters
commandant, oi, in the moie dignified language,  .
to the title of this item, " commanders," (leav-
ing the appellative " chief" off for the present )   I
They aie to receive ¡¡¡.2,500 on sea seivice, on
othei   duty,  $2,000       Waiting oiders, (that is,
engaged  to do nothing,) $1,800     Theie are at }
piescnt foity one of these officers in the service
They are mostly its active and efficient officers.
Their rank has not been abooe actual service, and
I am frank to admit, that some of them have not
heretofore obtained as much pay as their services
may have merited when compaied with other
grades in the Navy There seems to be an ex-
traordinary discrepancy in their pay and allow-
ances at present, which I cannot well account
for For instance, those nine who are in actual
sea service receive $1,356 25 each, while the nine
commanding navy-yards, receiving, or recruiting
stations obtain $2,010 75 each On the whole,
sir, if their pay and emoluments were properly
distributed, it would seem to me, that better
justice would be done, and this class of officers
more equally rewarded, if not better satisfied
Sir, (said Mr M ,) I could go through the de-
tails of this bill, in every grade of the service,
increasing the pay as it docs, in every instance,
to a degree not heietofore contemplated by even
the officers themselves     The committee who re-
ported it, has made two reports on the subject,
each differing in principle from the other, and
brought in three different bills for the same object,
each varying widely from its immediate prede-
cessor, and then the chairman before the Com-
mittee of the Whole, accepts, virtually, a new
bill, differing essentially from all the othei prop-
ositions, and this is amended, until you find if,
a deformity upon your table     After this exhibi-
tion, what confidence, sir, ought the House to
repose in the doings of the committee>   Why,
sir, the honoiable gentleman ought to suspect hia
own judgment, and distrust himself for having
lent his ears too willingly, to those whose intei-
ests had got the better ot their judgments     He
has informed us that he diligently sought the most
extensive mfoimation on this subject—but, sn,
(said Mr M ,) although I vail not question the
gentleman's  diligence,  yet T am compelled to
tloubt his success m the pursuit, and oppose the
use he  proposes  to  make  of his  attainments.
There aie, however, seveiaj documents appended
to his reports, from which I have compiled three
brief statements, to piove to you the two piopo-
sitions that this bill will increase the pay of the
Navy far beyond the maximum which the Secre-
taiy and the Navy board, acting in behalf of the
inteiest committed to their dnection, have asked
or desned, and secondly, that the present pay of
the Navy is, in all the grades except the lughei,
gieater than in any other consideiablt navy in
Euiope.    Foi this last purpose, I have used pait
of the precedents furnished to us of the pay in
the British and French Navies     Let me remark
further, that the document fm niched by the joint
dehbei ations of the Secretan-s of War and Navy,
was drawn up in obedience to a resolution of the
Senate of 3d March, 1833, requesting the Piesi-
dent to " cause to be prepared and laid before the
' Senate, at the commencement of its session, a
' plan for equalizing the pay of the officeis m the
' Army and Navy, and piovidmgfor afixedcom-
' pensalion fur then   «ei vices, in heu  of piesent
•allowances " After the Secietanes had prepared
this document or plan, they submitted it to the
Nav y boai d foi   their  consideration    and they
pioposed «onie modification's, by increasing some
giades and diminishing others, in a slight and
unimportant degree     Thus, sir, this plan of in-
crease in the pay of the Navy has the sanction
of the two Secietanes, the Navy boaid, as the
official íepiesentatives of the Navy, and of the
President of the United States     It is theiefoie
entitled to at least as much consideration as the
opinion of the honoiable gentleman, who  has
given us his three different opinions m the bhape
of bills
Mr Speaker, I have taken pams to compare
the pioviMons of this bill with the pay thus pro-
posed undei the official sanction, of the high offi-
ceis chaiged with this duty, and the pay provided
by the bill exceeds that proposed in the plan, in
every single instance except one oi two of the
highest giades
The bnef statements which I piesent is exam-
ples, exhibit the present pay of the Navy as far
as the same appears in the documents, the pay
proposed by the Secretaries and Navy board, the
mcieased pay provided in this bill, and the com-
paiatne pay in the British and Fiench navies
Here Mi  M read many of the details in the
