to effectually break them up. Second. The matter of exchange being under exclusive control of officers designated by the War Department, I cannot agree to meet General Forrest on that subject, but will received and transmit by the officer who carries the flag any proposition General Forrest feels authorized to make. I also directed the officer who goes with the flag to warn the rebel authorities that flags of truce must be based upon reasonably fair grounds. I inclose herewith a Mobile paper of the 5th. It is reported by a couple of negroes that the rebel cavalry was at Smithfield, Ala., a few days ago, feeling in this direction. I attach no special importance to the report, but shall keep a vigilant watch on all hostile movements. If I find that Forrest is presuming on the removal of the infantry from this place and moves to fighting distance, I shall cross my whole force and go after them. Quite a number of deserters came in to-day. They say that there are a number of small parties marching through the country, driving in stragglers, but know nothing of the whereabouts of the main rebel force. I will report result of reconnaissance and flag of truce as soon as known. In the meantime I hope the horses for Hatch will be hurried forward, so that when the order does come to move we may be prepared to go.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Gravelly Springs, Ala., February 10, 1865.

Major WILLIAM P. CHAMBLISS,Inspector Cavalry, Military Division of the Mississippi:

MAJOR: Your letter of the 3rd instant, by the hands of Captain Simpson, has just been received. I will make all necessary arrangements to distribute the Spencer carbines as fast as they are supplied. I have already directed requisitions to be handed in, and will designate the order of preference. Knipe's division has embarked for New Orleans, to supply it with horses I was compelled to dismount Hatch almost entirely. I hope the very minute that the demand for General Canby is supplied, the bureau will allow him to send every horse that can be obtained till Hatch is remounted. IN regard to the horses impressed at Louisville, I have directed a special inspection for the purpose of ascertaining the disposition made of them. I have received no intimation of an early movement of my command. General Thomas gave me to understand that there would probably be nothing done by him till he was ready and the roads would allow a movement. We are not ready now, i. e., we have nearly one entire division dismounted. The rest are as good as any we have, and about 500 in Long's. The roads are entirely impassable. If the order comes, as a matter of course I shall go. Those that have horses will be mounted; those without, dismounted. I have directed Captain Green to come here just as soon as the remnant of Knipe's division leaves Nashville. I am glad to know this request is approved by you. I shall be glad to see both him and you whenever you can come. I will send by Captain Simpson a report of the number of dismounted men reported by actual inspection.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
