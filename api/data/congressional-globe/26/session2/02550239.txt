offences—no such thing. If this had been all, al- I
though it would have violated that primary canon
of the Whig faith, that "proscription must be pro-
scribed," he should not nave been, m the slightest
degree, astonished Indeed, it would then have
been nothing more than he had anticipated. Buf
the present case was far different. It was an at-
tempt on the part of the Senate to violate as bind-
ing a contract as could be entered into by human
language It would present the spectacle before
the American people of this body disregarding its
plighted faiih, and, in the face oí the; world, tram-
pling under foot the vested rights which two Ame-
rican citizens had acquired under their contrae!
He would not be afraid to leave the decision of th s
question te any judicial tribunal in the land, upon a
mere statement of the facts, against all the argu
men's which ingenuity could adduce on the other
side
Frem the character of the resolution offered by
the Senator from North Carolina, [Mr Mai. güm,]
it might be easily inferred that a military chieltam
was at the head of the Government His resolu-
tion was in true military style, and us language
was precise, striking, and much to the point—with-
out ambiguity, and without a single unnecessary
word.   The following was a copy of it
Resolved, That Blair and Rives be dismissed as
Printers to the Senate for the 27th Congress "
Short, pointed, and directly to the purpose, it was
in the true style of Richard the Third ' Off with
his head' So much for Buckingham " "If rea-
sons were as thick as blackberries," he supposed
their friends on this side of the House would not
give us one "upon compulsion " still less would
they do so, when they had no reasons to give. The
resolution, therefore, was an act of meie naked
power, without any cause being assigned on its
face for its adoption. There was but one legiti-
mate cause wbich could, by possibility, have been
assigned, and that had no existence in this case If
Blair and Rives had violated any essential stipula-
tion ef their contract, it might proba b y have justi-
fied the Senate in annulling it altogether, and em-
ploying other Printers to perform the work, ^his
was not, this could not, be pretended. It had ne-
ver even been insinuated that B'air and Rives had
not heretofore Faithfully performed their duty as
Printers to the Senate, and this, was the best pledge
which could be given that they would do so here
after Why, then, were they to be dismissed in
this military style? Why was our own solemn
contract with them to be forfeited? Was it not
simply because they were the editors of a political
newspaper, and dared to publish articles in opposi-
tion to the party now in power? This had been
openly avowed as the reason.
"Off with his head '" What sm had poor Mr.
Rives ever committed, that he should be executed
with Mr. Blair? It w?s true that Mr Rives was a
partner in the firm, and in this capacity had en
tered into the contract, but it wao equally certain
that the duties which he performed were of a mers
business and mechanical character, and he had
never given cause of complaint to any peison
Why, then, should the political offences of Mr
Blair be visited on the head of his unoffending
partner, and the whole Globe be prostrated for the
purpose of reaching a single sinner?
This was, however, no subject to jest about, but
a question—and he said so with the utmost since-
rity and solemnity—involving a principle of greater
importance to the people of (his courtry than any
which had been before the Senate i f the Unittd
States since he had been a member of the bod)
Should Blair and Rives be dismissed fiom thur
contract, it would be recorded as a precedent, and
would prove to be the fruitful foundation of miny
evils in our future history.
He would state the facts of the ca^c with as
much e'earness and precision as he could
Previous to the year 1819, the printing of Coi -
gress had been executed under c< «tracts en ered
into with the lowest bidders, by *he S cretary of
the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Repies rta-
tives, respectively Afer long experience, it was
found to be necessary, for reasons wh'eh he should
not then enumerate, to change this practice, and fix
the mode of employing Printers by positive law
Accordingly, on the 3d March, 1819, a joint reso-
lution was adopted by Congress, and approved by
the President of the United States, declaring that
each House, previous to the termination of every
Congress, snould elect a suitable perton to execute
its own printing "during the next Congress " Th s
resolution prescribed particularly the manner in
which the printing should be done, and the prices
which were to be paid to the Printer The
•chief reason for adopting the resolution was clear
and obvious. It was utterly impossible that any
new contractor could be prepared with the necessa-
ry paper, materials, and workmen to execute pro-
perly the printing for either House of Congress,
without some months previous notice, and, there-
fore, the joint resolution gave him the time for pre
paration, which would necessarily elapse between
the termination of one Congre s and the meeting of
another The Printer, thus elected, was required
"to give bond, with sureties, to the satisfaction of the
Secretary of the Senate, for the prompt, accurate, and
neat execution nf the work " Ard what power was
granted by the resolution to your Secretary over
this Pnntei? Wny, sir, in case of any inconve-
nient delay in the delivery of the work, the Secre-
tary was authorized to employ another Printer to
perform any portion of it he thought proper, and,
if he were obliged to pay an increased puce, he was
directed to charge this excess m the account against
the regular Printer.
There was not one word in this resolution, from
beginning to end, which gave the least color to the
ldf-a that th s Printer was an officer of the Senate.
Throughout the whole of it he was not called an
officer, nor was his employmsnt alluded to as offi-
cial, nor was there a single term used which was
not in strict accordance with the mechanical na-
ture of the work to be performed Thu., then, s'ood
this case A solemn contract had been entered in-
to—under the jo nt resolution of 1819, confirmed as
it w¿is by the subseqjtnt resolu ion of 1829—with
Blair and Rives, who had leen duly elected Prin-
ters to the Senate—'heir bond, wiih sureties, had
been approved by the Secretary—the agreement on
both sides was perfect and complete, and, by its
terms was to endure throughout the twenty seven'h
Congress, and these contractor  h?d thus acquired
an absolute right, which no luman power could
constitutionally divest, to execute our printing and
receive for their work the stipulated c mpensation
Ten times in uninterrupted succession had the Se-
nate elected pr nters under this resolution of 1819,
and ten timei had the Printers thus elected exe-
cated the printing "during the next Congn ss "
When the eleventh period of election artived, the
Senators on this «ide of the hou e nee seiz d with
violent constitutional scruples-. They denounced
the joint resolution of 1819 as unconstitutional, and,
to manifest their abhorrence of its provisions in a
still more striking light, they resorted to the revolu-
tionary movement of refusing to vote for Printer,
and of giving notice that the moment they ob'amed
the power they wou'd nullify the t'eeiio" AccorJ
mg to their opimon, the Cot gre-.s wh ch had adop -
ed the resolution could have known noth rg about
the provisions of the Constitution, and our p-ede-
cessors, who, for almos' a quarter of a cenuiry, and
in times of tne highest pari) pxci e i ent, hid car-
ried it into execu ion, must hav° b en smpid doi s
Dur ng the whole of this long period they had been
violating the r oath to support the C< n ti utien, for
Senators on this side of the hue had as uied us
tnat the j lit resolut on of 1819  as <;n pU nly un-
constiutional, that h" ho luns migKt r"ad No,

broad enough to cove them Without in en 1 ng

This was thetr rol of ar ion on lh" present oc-

denounced as Lcco Focos, Agrarians, Levelled

tion be ad pted, all these h¡>rd na nes woa 1, he
trusted, beat once trans erred to their opponent'
But the resolution of 1819 -vas unconsuuticnai'
And if it were so, what would be the consequence?
It was this- that no constitutional power existed to
pass any law under which a binding contract could
b8 made for printing, or for the performance of any
other mechanical labor for either House of Con-
gress previous to the meeting of, that Congress for
which the work was to be performed. And why?
Because, say the Senators, the person who con-
tracts to perform such printing, is thereby at once
transformed into an officer of the Senate; and each
Senate possessing the power under the Constitution
to choose its own officer^, the act of employing
such a Printer by a previous Sena'e is in deroga-
tion of the constitutional right of choice, which be-
longs to the succeeding Senate, and is, therefore,
unconstitutional, null, and void This had been the
argument' It was difficult to treat it seriously,
but|he shou'd briefly show that our Printer was not
an officer of the Senate in the constitutional sense,
that if he were, it would not authorize the violation
of this contract, and that no such thing existed,
under onr system of Government, as a previous
and succeeding Senate, the Senate being a perma-
nent body
What argument had been used to prove that the
firm of Blair and Rives was an officer of the Se-
nate He had heard but one, and that was the
argument of the Senator from Delaware, [Mr.
Batard,] which had afterwards been endorsed by
the Senator from Kentucky, [Mr CtAT ] The Se-
nator must have been hard run to obtain it, for he
was obliged, for that purpose, to go back to a pe-
riod of the world before the art of printing was
discovered Tms he believed was about its form.
"If the* art of printing bad not been discovered,
our Secretary must have employed a great number
of amanuen es to mak- copies of our proceedings,
but the printers now make such copies by means
of their type, therefore, the printers may be con-
sidered av deputies of the Secretary and as officers
ot the Sena e " This argument assumed the fact,
that, had the art of printing not been discovered,
everv amanuensis who might have been employed
for the purpose of making copies of our journals
and proceedings for distribution among the people,
would necessarily have beome an officer of the
Senate If this illustration had not been so far
fetched, he should not have desired one mote
striking to prove the fallacy of the Senator's
own argument, than that which he himself had
thus presented Was not the idea perfectly
absurd, that the hundreds of mere copyists whom
it would have b en necessary to hire, had not
the art of printing been discovered, would each
one of them have become an officer—a deputy
Secretary of the Senate? In this purely imagina-
ry case, it would have been still more necessary
than even at present, to have provided, by contract,
at a preceding Congress, for procuring a great rram-
b°r (f copyi t«, and it would then have been still
more írconventent to have he'd that no power exist-
ed under thi-. Government whci would enable
Congress, nt i previous '•tssion, to provide copyists
for future service But the bare statement of the
pr iposition wa<- sufficient to convince every candid
and «npr judie d mind, that the mechanic who
contracted to per<oim the print fg of the body,
and wa%to receive for it the regular wages fixed
