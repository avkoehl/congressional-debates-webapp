over 600 men, will move immediately on to Osceola, and remain there until he receives advices of the movements of the enemy. I have sent out a small force to Warsaw (80 men). Will you keep me advised of the movements of the enemy as far as you are able? We will probably remain here to-night, unless advised of new movements.

JNO. EDWARDS,

Colonel, Commanding.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 9, 1863

Brigadier-General EWING:

The enemy in force has passed east of General Brown, and is moving north; is near Syracuse this evening. You should move to or beyond Warrensburg, so as to co-operate with General Brown, and interrupt the rebels if they turn west, unless your presence is required in the southern portion of your district, of which I have no knowledge.

Major-General SCHOFIELD, Saint Louis, Mo.:

Advices of taking Warsaw yesterday morning just reach me from Clinton. I turn toward Rose Hill and Warrensburg, as Colonel Lazear suggests, and expect to join Weer near Rose Hill. General Brown started toward Osceola yesterday. One or the other of us will pretty surely strike Shelby. With Weer's command, I will be strong enough, I think.

HEADQUARTERS,Saint Louis, October 9, 1863-10 p.m.

Brigadier-General EWING, in the Field:

Your dispatch of 6 a.m. to-day is read. Shelby is near Syracuse to-night. General Brown must be not far from Sedalia or Cole Camp. I think you should move toward Warrensburg, as I telegraphed you this morning. Perhaps Colonel Weer should remain in the vicinity of Fort Scott. Of this you can judge.

J. M. SCHOFIELD.

Lieutenant HADLEY,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

Inclosed is copy of a dispatch from Colonel Lazear,* in conformity with which I turn toward Rose Hill and Warrensburg, and expect to join Weer above Rose Hill. Have sent to Colonel Lynde to join me, if Quantrill is out of the way; otherwise not.
