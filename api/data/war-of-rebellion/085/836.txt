danger. You may send re-enforcements to Saint Charles if you can spare them. Douglass can retreat to the bridges, which, with your re-enforcements, he can certainly defend. I do not believe Shelby will come there, but leave to your discretion, if he should be there, the preliminary arrangements. Should he be there, advise me and we will endeavor to destroy him.

Brigadier-General EWING:

By order of Major-General Pleasonton, I sent Colonel McLane, with ambulance train, to Pilot Knob to bring in our wounded from there. I received a dispatch from Colonel McLane last night. he was then twenty-five miles west of here, with forty-six of our own wounded, all doing will. He reports some 200 rebels wounded still at Ironton. Says the most of them are very severely wounded and numbers are dying daily. I will send you Colonel McLane's official report as soon as received. He met with no rebel force during his march and reports the county clear of them.

I want especially to impress on you the importance of having the iron-works at Irondale and Iron Mountain unmolested. It would be a great calamity to this city if they were destroyed. Impress this on your command, and use all efforts to prevent their destruction.
