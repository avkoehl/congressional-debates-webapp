HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS, March 24, 1865.

Brigadier-General STEUART,Commanding Division:

I sent your orders a short time ago by telegraph to march your own brigade as soon as possible to the Petersburg railroad depot to take the cars for Petersburg. Your other brigades will follow as soon as transportation can be procured. Of this you will be notified by telegraph. Supply your division with three days' rations. Do not wait to cook them, though. General Lee will give your orders at Petersburg. Use every exertion to lose no time in the shipment of your troops.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS, March 24, 1865.

Brigadier General G. H. STEUART,Commanding Pickett's Division:

You will move the division headquarters with the first troops going off, accompanying them yourself. The rations for to-morrow will suffice. Your wagons can go by the Wilton bridge; also officers' horses-Drewry's Bluff. Leave an officer at your headquarters to receive orders from here and communicate them to the rest of the brigades. You had better start Corse and Terry for the depot at once. Hunton can start at 7 o'clock in the morning. If there is any probability of Hunton not getting off as soon as expected I will notify him through the officer you leave behind. Unless [he] hears from me he will start at 7 a.m. General Lee has requested to have orders awaiting you when you get off the cars. Send to him and report, however, as soon as you arrive.

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
