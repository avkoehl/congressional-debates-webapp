BUNKER HILL, August 19, 1864.

Lieutenant General R. H. ANDERSON:

GENERAL: There is no enemy between here and Martinsburg, and a small force of cavalry is reported to be there, variously estimated at from 800 to 2,000; I have sent to see. No force this side of the Opequon, but a cavalry force reported about Smithfield. McCausland had skirmishing with a cavalry picket near where the railroad bridge crosses the Opequon and drove it across the stream. I wish McCausland to take position at the crossing of the road by Brucetown to Smithfield, and I think it would be well for Fitz Lee to picket the crossing of the Opequon, on the road from Winchester to Summit Point; he can communicate across by Jordan Springs. No wheat has been burned in this country, and if we can stay here we can live. I have sent Lomax to Martinsburg. I think Fitz Lee had better try and shove the enemy back on the Berryville road.

Respectfully,

J. A. EARLY,

Lieutenant-General.
