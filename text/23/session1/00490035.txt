and asks for more The panic spreads and per-
vades the whole community, and finally results in

He who attended to the peculiar sensitiveness of
those who engaged in commercial transactions, to
the diligence and enterprise of the stock specula-
tors—they would have their spies in every pub-
lic house in this city, watching the progress of the
secret discussion of the subject in the standing
committee, and avail themselves of the informa-
tion thus obtained to the disadvantage of the pub-
lic interests. Why should we not proceed without
delay to an open discussion > Let those who wu>h
to impeach the act of the Secretary-of the Treas-
ury do it upon the reasons which he has furnished
in his report. Let the act be judged of according
to the reasoning and facts of tlje report
Mr FOOT concurred in the views taken by the
honorable member from New York, who had pre-
ceded him, and observed, that although from the
novelty of the present case, no precedent had been
adduced by those who justified that the proper
course to be taken in acting upon this question,
was to retain it in the Committee of the Whole,
yet m an authority always looked up to—Jeffer-
son's Manual—the principle was fully laid down,
that it was necessary for all important questions
to be referred to that committee that they might
be there digested and put into a shape to meet
the views of the majority, and which afterwards
being reported upon, could then be referred to one
or other of their standing committees He con-
cluded by observing, that as the act of removal of
the Secretary of the Treasury was consummated,
that he had given his reason for that removal, the
question was now before the House in a form for
them to act upon, and that as they did not want the
intervention of any committee to direct them how
they should act upon it, he hoped further time
would not be spent in discussing what was only a
preliminary question
Mr. BEARDSLEY asked the indulgence of the
House while he should submit a few remarks,
and in which he would promise to avoid all allu-
s on to the merits of the report of the Secretary
of the Treasury, and confine himself, as the rules
of propriety and order required he should do, to
such points as were properly at issue in the pres-
ent limited discussion The act incorporating
the Bank of the United States declared that the
moneys of the United States should be deposited
in the bank and its branches, unless otherwise
directed by the Secretary of the Treasury, in
which event he 13 required to report his leasons
for such direction to Congress That officer had,
in the performance of the duty thus assigned to
him, removed these deposites from the Bank of
the Un ted States, and placed them in certain State
institutions, and, as the act of Congress directed,
he has leported at large his reasons tor that meas-
ure This report, without any apparent consid-
eiation, and certainly without discussion, was
refeired to the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union A motion is now made to
reconsider that vote of reference, m order to bring
the subject under the control of the House, when
the House will be enabled to dispose of it as in its
deliLeratejudgmentshall be deemed fit and proper
The honorable mover of the piesent question
stated to the House that the vote of reference
was obtained, or rather assented to by himself,
under a misapprehension of what had been said
by the honorable gentleman who moved that
reference [Mr McDufi-ie] as to his object
Under such circumstances, Mr B submitted that
it was not unusual, and, indeed, that it was rather
a mattei of course, to reconsider a vote so given,
and thus subject the question to the eonsiderate
deteimmatnn of the House But this course it
appeared was not to be taken on the present oc-
casion And it was manifest that if anything 1 ad
been gained by the foimer vote of refeience, that
advantage was not to be given up without a strug-
gle The House, therefore, must necessarily pass
upon the pioposition submitted.
The report of the Secretary, he would observe,
was upon two important and distinct subjects—
one, the propriety of the removal of the public
funds from the Bank of the United States, the
other, the propriety of placing those funds in the
particular State banks which had been selected by
the Secretary. And the report presents a mass of
facts and of reasons in support of both these
measures. These different acts of the Secretary
stand on distinct and independent grounds. The
reasons given for the removal may be abundant and
satisfactory, and yet those presented in the report
in favor of the particular binks which have been
selected as depositories of the public funds may
be altogether insufficient. These banks may be
badly located for the convenience of the public, or
may be. unsound m credit or capital, either of
which would render that act of the Secretary
objectionable Th* report, however, covers the
whole ground, and asserts and maintains, notonly
the propriety of the removal, but the perfect con-
venience and solidity of the substituted institu-
tions But it is now urged as a reason for imme-
diate discussion and decision by this House, that
the public treasure is in danger, that these State
banks are unsound, "that their charters, their
capitals, their condition, are alike unknown," that
this, in truth, is not so much a question about the
United States Bank as about the rights of this
House, and the security of the treasure of the
people themselves endangered, as is asserted, by
this unwarrantable act of the Secretary In fact,
sir, it is said that the public money might as well
be at the bottom of the Potomac as where it has
been placed by the Secretary
Mr CLAYTON here rose and said that he had
been misapprehended, he did not insinuate any-
thing to the prejudice of the State banks, that if he
voted against the United States Bank as being an
unsound depository of the public money, it did
not follow that he was bound to think it would be
safe at the bottom of the Potomac
Mi B continued, and said that he might have
mistaken the precise import of the language of the
honorable member, but certain it was, that the im-
mediate decision of the question had been pressed
upon the House on the alleged ground of the inse
cunty of the State institutions, and the consequent
extreme danger of the public treasure Upon
these grounds of alarm the House had been urged
to act antWecide at once, without waiting the slow
movement of a committee
Sir, said Mr  B , these very reasons, so pathet-
ically urged in favor of retaining this document in
the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union, are, with me, controlling for an opposite
course     The reasons given by the Secretary for
what he has done, consist as well of matters of
11 fact as of his deductions from these facts     But
i the facts stated and relied upon by him, not only
11 in justification of the removal of the depositee,
but also to show the perfect security of the State
11 institutions, are called in question and disputed
by honorable gentlemen who have addressed the
House     Indeed, with the exception of his col-
I  league, [Mi   Seldeí.,] the stress of the argument
I   had been directed to that object The argument
of that gentleman, he admitted, had been diffei-
I ent      It was consistent and fair      It admitted,
II  unqualifiedly, that if the report of the Secretary
should remain in the Committee of the Whole, and
be there discussed and acted upon, its statements
I must all be taken as true, and the result would, of
course, depend not upon their accuracy in point
I of fact, but upon their sufficiency in sound reason
and propi lety If the House would act upon this
view of the case, Mr B said he, for one, would
be satisfied to see this motion fail, and the discus-
sion on the merits proceed without delay But
how and where shall we ascertain the tiuth of
theseadveise and contradictory allegations ! Aiot
in Committee of the Whole There gentlemen
may argue and debate, and there every one will
feel himself at liberty to assume and abide by his
own version of the fact's But in a standing or
«select committee, proof, if necessary, may be
taken, the truth elicited and reported to the House
If truth, upon controverted allegations, is desirable,
this is the only way in which it can be ainved at
by the House This consideration, Mr B said,
was decis've of the vote he should give He
chose to leain whether the information which the
Secretary had received, upon which he had relied,
and which he had given to the House, was correct
or not, before he passed upon the soundness and
accuracy of his views.
It was admitted by the honorable member from
Pennsylvania, [Mr. Biknet,] that documentsfrom
the Secretary of the Treasury of this description
were usually referred to a standing or select com-
mittee, and not to a Committee of the Whole
House What adequate reason had been given,
or existed, for departing in this instance from the
usual course' He maintained there was none
whatever Why was immediate discussion neces-
sary' One honorable gentleman had said that
this House, in vindication of its authority, should
at once order a restoration of the deposites. This,
to him, was extraordinary language—a most ex-
traordinary proposition. He would ask, what
authority of this House had been violated by this
act of the Secretary > Had he done more than he
was authorized to do by the public law of the
land' This House had, singly, as he contended,
no power to act upon this subject, although, as a
component part of the Legislature of the Union,
it might with propriety act and decide It was
only, however, as he supposed, in the passage of
a law, that it could contribute towards a res-
toration of the deposites, or_vindicate its own
authority It had no other authority in this mat-
ter than the ordinary law-making power of the
House
Mr B said he had understood the honorable
member fiom Pennsylvania [Mr. Binney] to
maintain that Congress could only exercise in this
case an appellate power over the decision of the
Secretary of the Treasury, that this House could
not look beyond the report for reasons to influence
its decision This seemed to him altogether too
technical and limited a view of the matter, and he
thought could not receive the sanction of the
House It was urged that the bank, by accepting
its charter, had assented that the Secretary might
I first decide upon the removal or retention of the
public deposites, subject, however, to the control-
ling power of Congress by way of appeal from
that decision, but upon those grounds, and those
alone, which had been acted upon and advanced
by the Secretary But he could not find this limit-
ation to the power of Congress in the charter or
elsewhere The charter gave to the Secretary the
unqualified power of removal. True, it made it
his duty to report his reasons, but it did not pro-
fess, in any respect, to limit the supervising power
of Congress That power was left upon the broad
basis of the Constitution, and if the reasons as-
signed in the present instance by the Secretary
should turn out to be unsatisfactory and insuffi-
cient, which he was very far from conceding or
supposing would be the case, yet if others existed
of a more cogent nature, and of themselves con-
fessedly sufficient, he asked if it could be supposed
that Congress, under such circumstances, would
direct a restoration of the public deposites to be
made > He supposed not, although the argument
of the honorable gentleman led to a different con-
clusion
His colleague [Mr Selden] had urged the 1m-
poitance of time in making a final disposition of
this question, that a reference to a standing or
select committee would extend the period of final
determination heyond sixty or ninety days, the
ordinary time for commercial paper to run in the
banks The honoiable gentleman insisted that,
in this aspect, the action of this House ought to
be instantaneous Mr B said, that his colleague
seemed to have overlooked the fact that the de-
posites were removed about ninety days since,
during which time, the whole community had acted
upon the assumption that they would remain
in the State institutions The State banks had
regulated then discounts accordingly, and every
one, he believed, had conducted his own affairs
upon thit supposition and they would, no doubt,
continue to manage their concerns in the same way,
unless alai med by the agitation here He would
ask, in all seriousness, if gentlemen could hope
in any way to procure a passage of a law of any
descnption in time to meet this critical period of
rinety days, from the time when the decisive step
\t as taken by the Secretary of the Treasury As
to the pretense that immediate discussion and de-
cision vveie required or expected by the country
