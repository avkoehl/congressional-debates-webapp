nor, fourth, could they give tlie names or residence oi
any per-on by ivhnm their statements eould be veri-
fied; nor, fifth, did oil her of these distinguished hu-
maniTmuansthinkitneceasary to give the civil author-
ities any inhumation of the enormous wrongs which
had thus fallen under their own observation. Saeh
testimony your committee cannot regard as worthy
ot serious consideration.
Ifithadbecn trucin everypartu ular, it would havo
been far from justifying the statement of General
Fisk, thai "on the day before yc-terday, in Lexing-
ton, thirteen discharged eoloied soldiexs stood in titc
street, in full sight of Henry Clay V monument, with
their bodies lacerated, their backs bleeding from the
cruel lash, their heads cut to the scalp, andoneortwo
of them -with their eye put out," '* for going to their
former masters and asking for their wives and chil-
dren;" for not one instance is reported where a negro
soldier waQ cut with the lash; not one where the eye
of a negro soldier was putout^ not onewhercanegro
soldier was in any way maltreated for asking for his
wile and children. On the other hand, the uniform
tenor of the remaining depositions clearly establishes
the kind and indulgent treatment of the negro,
whet her slave or free, in that locality.
Your committee call attention to the political char-
acter of the witnesses. There were more radical Union
men among them than conservatives or Democrats—
one of them a Federal official; another, (the ^ itne-^s
llawes,) specially employed by " a gentleman in the
military service of the I'm fed States,'/ whose name
he declined to furnish, to hunt up testimony U^sus-
tam the statements ol Geneial msk. And this is all
they have boon able to collect: seven ca^os of more
or less aggravated assault, and one of abusive lan-
guage. Your committee ventures the statement, that
in any 1 egiun oi the V aited States having a popula-
tion and extent otpta! to ihat over which these in-
quiries have ranged, the same number of intelligent
witnesses could be lound, able to procure information
of a larger number oi grosser outrages upon white
men than these witnesses have detailed as inflicted
upon negroes. It must also be remembered that the
fctatemejHs of the witnesses a-5 to all the serious cases
purport to be made from the information of others,
who were not present, and whose veracity could not
thereloi e be tested.
The witness llawes having stated that Dr. Pinker-
ton (the agent lor the Preedmen's Bureau in Lexing-
ton) was reported to have information of another ea-.e
of assault upon a neuro, the eojumnteo direetrd him
to be summoned, but the sheriif made reinm thai, 1 he
doctor, though in his office, stated that he was too
unwell to wait upon the committee.  So soon as the
other witne-<sca were examined the committee pro-
ceeded in person to the doctoi *s ollicc: but ho had left
and locked up the picmhes before tlieir aruval, with-
out leaving any indication as to where he might be
found.
The committee ought not to close their comments
on tlie ca-c without calling attention to ihc remark-
able difference intheehaige made in hi* published
speech and that madem hi- loGer to Mr. Armstrong.

"several bruised head-1 and swollen eyes, wnile the

eoin 'rendered beforet he passageof the eon:-that ional !

actuated by a t-ense of duty in making such anadver-
U-em>mf, or who* er his conduct was prompted by
that morbid craving for notoriety now .-o prevalent,
the commute e do not undertake to determine. It is
sufficient to know that the advertisement was absurd,
and must have been known to be so by the parties
who got it up.
Your committee do not doubt that the General As-
sembly, on reading the proof annexed, will come to tiie
same conclusion at which they have arrived, namely,
that the charges made by General Kisk in reference
to the maltreatment of negro soldiers m the vicinity
of Lexington and the conduct of the civil authori-
ties of the State toward offenders of that cla^s are
false and slanderous. They arebutaeontinuation of
the system of misrepresentation to which the people
of this State have been exposed lor several years—a
system introduced and persevered m by office-holders
of the General Government in order to extend and
continue, their own prolits :>nd_ powers; and but too
much encouragcd by eertaiu citizens of the State it-
self, in the hope of reconunendnni themseh es thereby
to tlie patronage oi the party in power at Washington.

W\SHIXOTOX, T>. C., Fhniarn 2, 1>K>.
Beak Str: I have the honor to ueknowlr-dge the
receipt ot your telegram of this da \ e. ira hvj. nie notn-e
of a meeting of your legi lauve ( onymH
fort by the 20tli or 25th instant, and will then be
pleaded to meet your committee and aid you in in-
vestigating not only the eases to which I referred in
my Cincinnati spcuch, but many others ot similar
eharaetcr of whu.h complaints are made in diiieront
sections of the State.
1 trust that great goodwill remit from this investi-
j gat ion. Let us no do\\u to the" hard-pan," a-nd ascer-
tain the exact (ondi lion of the lreedmen of Kentucky,
and the disposition of >oui people toward them.
Keports of outrages upon returned eolored soldiers
especially are continually reaching mef'rom the"blne-
grass" and tobacco-producing sections of your fiiato.
it is charged that in some localities the civil author-
ities utterly neglect to piotcet tlio fieedmeu; that in
other sections they refuse to do so, and in a lew places
that they are powerless in the presence of outlaws,
who pursue with wrath and vengeaneo our mustercd-
out soldiers, without distinction of color.
X know from my own observation that there is some
trulh in these reports. 1 was at Lexington on the
15th andJOth ultimo. T had been expected there for
many days, and a number of freedmen from the sur-
rounding counties had congregated at that point to
meet me and make known their complaints. 1 saw
thirteen colored men who had been soldiers in tho
Army, all of whom stated that thevhad been mal-
treated by their former owners when they had returned
totheir old homes toaskfor their wives ami child: on.
Some of them, from Garrard county, I think, "with
their bruised heads and swollen eyes, gave evidence
ol severe treatment. U! hers stated that they had been
ei ucliv beaten and threatened with shooting, ikmr-
bon, Woodford, Madron, Montgomeiy, and Garrard
counties weie represented at Lexington. The men
weie intelligiiit. They apneaiul hoftest, and boro
tho evidence of uvi Sfi ea.'men t opon their per-ons. I
assureyoul tluuight, hom their statement^ and ap-
pearance, tha t thev had been brutally treated. I
referred them to the proper parties that their com-
plaints might be duly investigated and their wrongs
redressed,
J was informed by gentlemen in whom I had crreafc
confidence, that the c«vil authorities gave no atten-
tion to these ou}races, and I lott Lexingion with tho
conviction thai the freedmen ot the blue-grass section
ought to havomore piMteetkm than thoeivil author-
ities couId,or would allord,
Comuiunical loi's from reliable citizens of Ken-
iuckv, tluoir-h tlie War Department at_Wa-hin^ton,

dition ot the people over whom I h.nt siiperv i^ion. I
