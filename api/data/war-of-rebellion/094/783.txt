The general commanding desires to call the attention of all commanding officer to depredations daily committed in the vicinity of the army by soldiers with arms in their hands. To endeavor in some measure to prevent this, arms will be kept constantly stacked on the color lines, and company rolls called frequently during the day, to ascertain absentees from camp.

By command of General Hood:

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,Tupelo, Miss., January 14, 1865.

Lieutenant-General STEWART,

Commanding Corps:

General Hood directs that you will keep all commanding officers on the lookout for deserters, and should men desert have them promptly reported to these headquarters, and at the same time take every measure to find out the route they have taken and endeavor to capture them. If the first few parties who desert can be caught and promptly punished it will perhaps deter others. Depredations of all kinds are daily increasing in the vicinity of the army, and commanding officers should use every means to keep their men constantly employed in camp, and patrols, under good officers, should be sent out to arrest and bring to punishment men who are caught depredating.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

A. P. MASON,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Same to Generals Cheatham and Stevenson.)
HEADQUARTERS,Tupelo, Miss., January 14, 1865.

Major General N. B. FORREST,

Commanding Cavalry:

General Hood directs that you will keep some picked bodies of cavalry near at hand that they may be ready to pursue and capture any men that may desert from the army. If the first party of deserters can be caught and promptly punished, it will perhaps deter others from doing the same.

A. P. MASON,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
