Mar. 1838.____________APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE._________________509
25th Cong«"«2nd Sess.                                 Independent Treasury—Mr. White.                                                            Senate.
ster, as the chairman of the committee, reported,
in Paneuil Hall, the resolutions in which this pro-
position was first announced; and they were adopt-
ed by the people of Boston. Yet, sir, but a few
years afterward , when we ventured to believe
and practice their teachings, these men—these
statesmen, whose enlarged patriotism regards only
the good of all, these brethren, whose sympathies
enclose the whole Union in their fraternal embraces,
were prepared to dip their hands in our blood—
if possible, to strangle truth by guilt. "We were
told to go for relief to the courts of the
United States to test the constitutionality of
these laws, but with the meanness of conscious
oppressors a falsehood was retained on the
lace of the bill, by which we were excluded
from them The bill purported to be passed lor
revenue; and when Colonel Drayton, a Reprewt'-
ative from South Carolina, moved that its true title
should be giveh to it, in order that its constitution-
ality should be tried, you refused to do it. Never-
theless, to exhaust the íemedy you proposed to us,
we did go to the courts of the United States, and
knocked at its doors for admittance to try our
rights, bat they were shut in our faces by the fraud
of your legislation. We determined to resist } our
lawlessness—your unconstitutional oppsession—not
for any local, selfish interest, but for a cause as
broad as the Union itself, not in a time of war
and trouble—for then, as heretofore, our State
motto would have blazoned on the shield of the
Union, "ammis ojnhns que parali," not in a time of
debt and pecuniary embarrasbment—for your na-
tional debt was nearly paid, and jour Treasury
was overflowing, not in an era of Executive im-
becility—but when the Executive authority
threatened to absorb all others, and the most
popular man and efficient soliic-, since the
days of Washington, held the baton of Executive
command. The State interposed for the protection
of her citizens, against ihe lawless aggressions of
this Government; in that form, and by that
authority, which had been practised before, and
maintained to be constitutional, from the com-
mencement cf the Union. Was South Carolina
" lawless" in her resistance? If she was, I tell
gentlemen, it is just such " lawlessness" as they
may expect to encounter, so long as this Govern-
ment presides over the destinies of a free and en-
lightened people Oppression submitted to, soon
becomes habit, and the spirt of liberty expires be-
neath us influence. According to our conscien-
tious convictions, justice and honor, the cause of
the Constitution and of the Union itself, lequired
u¡> to resist. Shallow bigotry may rail and de-
nounce, but it will neither convince nor intimidate
You gave way. You proposed a compromise, far
more advantageous than that proposed for your ac-
ceptance m the Senate, by a Carolina Senator/
but two years before. And why, sir, did you yield'
Was it because the resistance of the State was so
very contemptible as> to be likened to a company of
boys with cornstalks, marching against fifty thou-
sand grenadiers six feet high? If the resistance of
the State was so very insignificant, it is impossible
to account for the compromise bill of 1833, upon
any principles worthy gentlemen and statesmen
Causeless cowardice, or a deliberate betrayal of the
tariff interests by its friends, must have produced
it. It is only upon the supposition, that the resist-
ance of the State was formidable, that the peace
of the countiy, the existence of the Union, and
the tariff policy itself was endangered, that we can
find any oí those elevated motn es, which, I doubt
not, actuated those who originated and passed this
bill. Sir, the " lawlessness" of South Carolina
will not have been in vain, if it has b ought to light
that great truth, which lies at the foundation of
our Union—that this is a Government of opinion,
and not of force, and ought therefore to be so ad-
ministered, as to conci'iale the affecdons of all, by
superintending the general interests of all, without
infringing upon the sectional interests of any por-
tion of the confederacy. By such a course alone,
can the Union be preserved, or be worth preserving.
'General Hayne piuposed that the tariff bill should be re
ducedin tenyeais to twenty five per cent The compromise
bill reduces u te twenty per cent, in
SPEECH OF MR. WHITE,
Of Tennessee.
In Senate of the United States, March 24, 1838—upon the
bill reported fiom the Committee on Finance, commonly
called the Sub Treasury bill
The motion of Mr Cuthbert, to strike out the 23d section,
being undei considera en,—
Mi   WHITE lose and addresbed the Senate as follows
Mr President Iaddressyuu undei circumstances of pecu
liar disadvantage The subject 18 one of the greatest importance
It has been long discussed, ably discussed, by those of most
distinguished talents Their highest efforts have been made on
both sides to present its advantages and disadvantages in every
view the human mind can take of it
The crowded audience has become wearied, and even many
Senator*. themseHes can hardly give respectful attention to our
most interesting debates
Up to the termination of the last addiess of the distinguished
Senator from Massachusetts who sits nearest to me, (Mr Web
ster,) I was not satisfied whether it would be my duty to do
moie than listen respectfully to others, and then say yea or nay
to the different questions presented to the Senate
At the close of his animated, able, and interesting speech, he
recurred to a sciap of the history of my own State, fifty yeais
ago Instantly my mind settled down m the conviction that my
constituents had a right to expect more oí a son of one of the
actors in that st ene than a bate vote
I piemise those who may favor me with their attention, that
if what I say should not be intei estmg, it shall not be tedious
The advocates of this bill expect to accomplish two objects
by its passage
1st To designate the only speues of funds which shall be re
ceived m payment of any dues to the Government
2d To designate thP persons by whom, and the places where,
those moneys shall be kept, between the time of their collection
and disbursement
The provisions, as to the first, *are, that after the lapse of six
yeais nothing shall be íeceived but gold and silver, and ^uch
papei as shall be issued by or under the authonty of the Fed
eral Government, and, in the mean time, that certain propor
lions may be received i1 the notes of specie paying banks
lsi My first objection to this plan is, that it seta out with a
distinction m favor of those who are in the employment of the
Federal Government, or have any money to íeceive from it
and those who are m the employ of the State Governmentb, at>
well as the masa of ths people The distinction is odious and
ought not to be sanctioned
toenators who support this bill say these aie mere catch
words, (one kind of money for the Government and another for
the People ) of which all here have become ashamed, md that
latterly they have been driven oat of the Senate
1o this I reply, the gentlemen aie mistaken , this distinction
is made on the very face of the bill, m terms too plain to be
misunderstood
TfaUthe money mentioned is of equal value, why mention
gold and silver, Treasuiy notes, notes of specie paying banks,
&c ? The whole aigument in favor of the bill rests on the
supposition that gold and silver are the best, and thai, as fai a&
it goes, is to be used for Federal officers and thoce wh i have
Federal contracts, leaving to others to get what they can, and
how they can
2d The bill itself contemplates a papei medium, emanating
from the Federal Government To this I object Because we
have no power to issue it As a currency, they are bills oi
credit, unconstitutional, moie cleaily sojthan to incorporate a
bank Because, if we can issue such a medium, wt ought
never to do it It will lead to the most wasteful and extrava
gant expenditures It will be used moderately at first, until
the people become reconciled to it, and then gradually extended
in place of borrowing money, so as to meet all the calis of an
extravagant Administration, |and must'end m a large national
debt, or depreciate like your continental money
Many, with great reason, have believed that no Government
can long be econemical upon even a system of indirect taxa
tion, that under such a system the people geneially are not
conscious of the burdens they bear They pay then taxes
when they buy theirclothes, or other articles, on which duties
are imposed, without reflecting that any part of the money they
tlius expend comes into the Treasury , they thereloie ct-ase to
be watchful over the mannei in which the public moneys are
expended and, whenever they cease to keep strict watch, their
agents commence useless and wasteful expenditure^ But when
the taxes are direct, every man knows how much he pays and
when he pays, and will caiefully watch how the moneys are
expended , and ii the expenditures are wasteful oi extrava
gant, a suitable corrective will be immediately applied Out
whole system of Federal taxation is m the geneial indirect and
if we once commence a system of supply rog deficiencies m the
Treasury by an issue of paper to be used as cut rency the
country may be rained
At the special sebslon we were obliged to add ten millions of
dollars to our means This we did not do by a direct loan
which every man could understand, but by authorizing an usue
«f Treasuiy notes When that bill was before the Senate
the Senator lrom Missouri, and, if I mistake not, the Senator
from Pennsylvania, both friends of the Administration, placed
these notes on the ground of making a loan, that thev as they
were to bear an interest, not exceeding five per cent v, onld be
disposed of for money, and with the money thus procured our
our creditors could be paid, and in this view 1 voted for the
bill In the House the amount oí the notes was reduced one
half, and I soon perceived that the Administration intended to
use them not to procure a loan, but as a currency, and when
the bill was returned to us, I took the earliest opportunity to
record my vote against it The notes issued under that bill
have~m fact been -used as a currency, and at various rates ef
interest, some as low as one mill per year
This year our revenue is agam to be deficient We will
need, m addiu  n to our means m the Treasury, ten, fifteen,
oi twenty millions ef dollars, and this addition will be
made by new issues This paper currency seems to cost
nothing, and, as our wants increase, the issues will be
increased until the paper depreciates, and then, for tte
first time, the people will seriously look mte the manner *n
which not only their money, but their credit, las been
«squandered
The provisions of this bill for Treasury notes, bills, or other
securities, tssued by the Federal Government, or under it
authority, if sanctioned by Congress, will «attk a principle
which, if carried into practice, must seal the fate of this nation.
Office holders and office hunters can all be accommodated by
the Execuave at the public expense, and the people will not
be aware of it until too late    In e-hori, it will take off almost
the only restraint which yet remains to our extravagant ex
penditures
This view of the subject has alarmed me Do we not all
see and know that those in office are pressing to hare their
salaries increased i That those who are not, desire the mm*
ber of offices incieased that they may get ml We are teaeed
to inciease the number of land districts, arid if we do, offices
are multiplied When all offices among the whites are fitted,
then vte have among our red brethren, exploring parties, visit
mg paitie , commissioners and agents, by construction, at Ex-
ecutive discretion, and compensated as he pleases
Wi'h the facilities of paper money, to be created for the
ti ouble of making, importunities for offices, jobs, con$ractst
and ino ease of salary, will be multiplied, and the President
will not have the heart 10 resist them when artfuliy pressed by
noi«y <md worthless partisans I have been foicibJv struck
with «ome of the remarks made upon the subject of this Got
eminent paper currency The honorable Senator from South
Carolina, (Mr Calhoun,) thinks it will not depreciate, and tí it
does, it will not make any difference, as the Government must
always i eceive it at pai, and therefore sustain the whole loss
Mr Pie^ident, if the honorable Senator will take a moment
to think upon this subject, I am convinced he will perceive the
eiroi i\o paper currency, not convertible into specie at the
u ill of the holder, ever did or ever will long retain its nominal
value
11 a man has a note of any kind, and has confidence that
he can eei the amount of it in specie at any time he pleases,
mo=,t generally he would rather have the note than specie, be
cause moie convenient but the moment he doubts, then he
wants the specie presentlv in the issue of Treasury notes,
that moment the amountissued much exceedsthe íevenue to
be paid into the Treasury, and the purchase of public lauds,
fhey mu^t and will depreciate, unless provision is made that
they shall be pad when presented at the Treasurv When
they do depreciatej the whole loss will not fall on the Treasury
but will fall likewise on thsse through whose bands they have
passed The veiy case put by the Senator proves it A Trees
ury note issues for fifteen dollars It depreciates until it can
be pui chased in market for ten Some person who owes the
Tiea«uiy fifteen dolíais goes and purchases it at ten, and pays
his debt oi fifteen dollars Isow does not every one perceive
that the profit of five dollars, made bv the man who paid the
note into the Treasury mus' have been a loss of the same
amount to the man fiom whom he purchased, or to some
othei poison, thiough whose hands it has passed 1 In all
such cases, profit and loes are correlative teims, and that
w Inch is one man's gain mu<t have heen a lo s to some other
As > ou increase expenditures you increase Executive
powei, already too great The President o  those acting un
der his orders, mus  necessarily select the recipients, who,
it will alwa\s be undeistood, tan only be those who con
form to his wiohes in elections These objections are inde
pei4ent of the consideration whether this bill will establish
ab^rk or not It will certainly «anction the issuing a papei
me' an of circulation I hose who ad\ocate this provision
think as 1 do that the country must and always will have
bank credits, or paper of some kind, to u«e as a substitute ior
the precious metals The bu^ne^s of the country can nevei
be c'one without if A «upport of the State banks is the only
j shield which can be presented against Federal bills of credit,
and a Federal incorporated bank
I hold both these last unconstitutional, and the first of them
lnfiniUly the most dangerous to the liberties of the people
In 183-1,1 heard oí this plan of separating Government from
all banks as depositories, and thought well of it Indeed, I
would then have gone for it, if political friends had agreed
upon it Then theie was no idea of issuing paper money by
Government Then State banks tcete paying specie, and
then notes would have continued a circulating medium Then
I had confidence m the Aaministration and believed that none
wouH evei dare to interfere with the elective franchise, orto
reluse to have the Executive pationage limited and curtailed
bylaw Now all the^e things aie changed The Administra
tion want paper money, i^ued by Government substituted for
loans The State banks aie not paying specie, and this bill
iorbids the íeceipt of their notes
The J-\eciitive is disposed to hunt down any and e\try man
who wishes to limit his powei He openlv interferes melee
tions, both State and Federal, and u*es all his powers to have
them carried accoidmg to his will' tinker these circumstances,
in my judgment I would be a tiaitor to civil liberty, were I to
sanction the idea that we will make Federal paper the circula-
ting medium
What ha*  become of our bills, five or six in number, to
limit Executive patronage, reported in the days of the younger
Adan a "* They sleep the sleep ol death The honorable
chairman of the committee who originally íeported them,
felt it h s duty to endeavor te revive them under the Administra
tion of the late President, and received so little countenance from
old friends that he ceased his struggle with them
The honoiable senatoi from South Cajolma, who never
thinks any load too heavy, took up one of them, and made
one of his powerful efforts, and it passed this body But how
many old fiiends voted with u1 Sir, all had been whistled or
ordeied off, except the Senator from Missouri and one or two
other*
I ha\e been honored with a seat here for the thirteen or four
teen last sessions, and believe I have never once recurred to the
journals to see how any gentleman had vo'ed, but there are
some things I find it impossible to forget
When that bdl was before the Senate, believing that I could
give the Senatoi fiom South Carolina something more than my
vote, I made a speech in its favor and that speech seated my
fate with the great Democratic party I respectfully ask the
Senator from Missouri, whether any of thefirmer friends of
thatmeasute the Jackson democrats, voted for it, except he
and myselP
It went to the other House, and as they were more fresh from
the people than \\ e, bet er understood what is meant by modem
democracy, they put this aristocratic banking to sleep , and we
have never heaid a cry or even a wiump*r from it since Sinee
then, executive power and patronage have put forth their
branches In every direction, and no man dare raise his voice
against them on pain of poUucal death
Shall we then put this rich bed of manuse to the rCNK of ÜM*
