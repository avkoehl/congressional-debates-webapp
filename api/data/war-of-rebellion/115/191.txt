Major General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN,

Headquarters U. S. Army.

MY DEAR GENERAL: From representations which have at different times been made to me I am induced to inquire whether in your judgment Colonel Justin Dimick is entirely such an officer as ought to be the keeper of state prisoners and the commandant of so important a post as that of Fort Warren.

Very truly, yours,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, January 17, 1862.

JOHN A. KENNEDY, Esq.,

Superintendent of Police, New York.

SIR: This Department has received information to the effect that the house of Trenholm Bros. &amp; Co., No. 42 Pine street, New York, is a branch of the house of Fraser Trenholm & Co., of Liverpool, an John Fraser & Co., of Charleston, S. C. It is important and desirable to ascertain the truth of these statement because the two last-named houses have from the commencement of the insurrection been engaged in attempts to run the blockade, and some of the vessels owned by them have succeeded in that attempt. I will consequently thank you to inquire, first, if the Messrs. Trenholm in New York are British subject, and secondly, if their house is a branch of the others referred to. It is not deemed advisable to take any other steps until Department shall have received information on these points.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, January 17, 1862.

GENERAL: You will please send Miss Ellie M. Poole, a prisoner in your custody in this city, under the protection and custody of a proper guard by way of Baltimore to Fortress Monroe and thence under flag of truce beyond the lines of the U. S. forces, there to be discharged.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. W. SEWARD,

Assistant Secretary.
