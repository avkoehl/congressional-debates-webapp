account of the tried superiority of these commands, while it seems to me clearly right in view of the facts peculiar to the several cases and the just claims of all the parties.

The sketch of an order providing these several arrangements I have the honor herewith to present.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. N. PENDLETON,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Artillery.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS, March 18, 1865.

General R. E. LEE,Commanding, &amp;c.:

The enemy drove in our cavalry pickets on Williamsburg road. I think it is done to cover the passage of his troops over the Chickahominy, at Bottom's Bridge. One brigade of cavalry is reported passing.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS, March 18, 1865.

Major-General C. W. FIELD,Commanding, &c.:

General Longstreet directs that you hold two of your brigades in readiness, with Gary's cavalry, to attack the enemy at Bottom's Bridge to-night. General Gary has been ordered to report to you for this purpose. Your pickets will remain as they are and only such men as are not on picket of the brigades you take will be used. You will take charge of the expedition in person. The artillery attached to Gary's brigade will accompany you. Hold all the troops you intend to take in readiness, and further orders will be sent you.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Has Kautz's division, which you report at Bottom's Bridge, crossed the Chickahominy? I supposed it had and was preparing to attack it on this side.
