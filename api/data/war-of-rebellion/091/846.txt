U. S. forces, Martinsburg, Va. The great difficulty sought to be removed is the unnecessary interference with citizens in their legitimate pursuits and the refusal of the pickets to recognize the passes of general officers in this military district. I send you copy of orders governing trade in this district. I do not think there will be army misunderstanding in future.

Very respectfully,

S. F. ADAMS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

CUMBERLAND, December 31, 1864.

Colonel HIGGINS,
