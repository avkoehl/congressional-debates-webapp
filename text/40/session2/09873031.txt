Mr. HILL. 1 cannot yield now, as I desire
first to make an explanation of the provisions
" bill.
SPEAKER. The pending question is
amendments which have just been read.
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, this bill contem-
plates the establishing of an American line of
mail and emigrant passenger steamships be-
tween New York and one or more European
ports." The Commercial Navigation Company
of the State of New York propose to build at
least seven first-class steamships, and when
constructed shall be organized into and com-
pose the United States mail steamship line, for
proper conveyance of mails and passengers.
The bill also provides that in order that this
line may be placed on a good basis, succeed,
and obtain a nationality, the Postmaster Gen-
eral is empowered and authorized to contract
with the " Commercial Navigation Company"
for the weekly or semi-weekly conveyance of
all European and foreign mails of the United
States between New York and Bremen, touch-
ing at Southampton, England, or Liverpool,
touching at Queenstown, for a term not exceed-
ing twenty years.
That to insure the construction of the above-
mentioned vessels within the time and in the man-
ner heieinbefore provided, and the maintenance of
the said line, the said Commercial Navigation Com-
pany may issue bonds to such an amount that the
entire annual interest thereon shall not exceed the
sum of $250,000, such bonds to he made payable at
the expiration of the beiore-named twenty years,
and the interest thereof to be made pay able semi-an-
nually,the principal and interest of such bonds to be
made payable in coinol iheUmtedStates. Thatior
tue protection of tbeholdersof such bonds they shall
be severa.iy registered at the Post OlBce Department
and certified by the chief clerk of the Department.
And the Postmaster General shall receive a/1 moneys
lor postage earned by the steamships ol said com-
pany, and shall apply the same as lar as needed to
the payment of the semi-annual interest upon the
before-named bonds, and shall retain the surplus
alter paying such interest, and shall invest the same
quarterly in the securities of the United States to
toim a sinking fund, to be held solely tor the benefit
of the bondholders, and to be applied to thepayment
of the principal of such bonds. And whenever, and
as soon as, such sinking iund shall equal in amount
the entile principal of said bonds, then Irom that
time forward the interest of said bonds shall be paid
out of the income of such sinking Iund, and the
principal thereof out of the same Iund at their
maturity. And all postage earned after the time
when said sinking Iund shall be made up to the
amount aforesaid shall belong to and be paid quar-
terly to the said company by the Postmastei General
of the United States.
Mr. Speaker, these are the main features of
the bill, and Congress may at any time alter,
repeal, or amend them.
Never was there m the history of our Gov-
ernment a tunc when the absolute requirement
of a mail and emigrant steam line to Europe
was as important as now; yet, to-day,'We have
not one single steamship performing regular
service to Europe under oar flag. Foreign
steamers do all our mail, passenger, and freight
business, and we, the greatest Power on earth,
see our Government dispatches, Government
agents, maiis, and passengers go to and fio to
England, France, Prussia, &c., under the flag
and protection of Powers who are in no ease
our superiors.
The Postmaster General's reports, the last
six years, show that we have paid away over
two million dollars for the transportation of our
mails by foreigners, all of which could have
been, and should have been, paid to our own
people. Besides this, it is estimated that mer-
chants and emigrants have paid out over fifty
millions more for freight and passage money, all
of which also went into the pockets of foreign
ship-owners. This company intend these ships
shall be built in tkis country, thus fostering
American industry and giving work to our
own mechanics and laborers. It is their pur-
pose to so construct these vessels that passen-
gers will have every possible comfort and
convenience.
The manner in which emigrants are brought
to our shores on foreign ships is an outrage on
humanity, and ought to attract the attention
not only of Congress but the whole nation.
The Commissioners of Emigration of New
York city, in their report in January last,
state:
" That of eleven thousand two hundred and sixty-
four steerage passengers who arrived in 1865 in our
port from Hamburg, two hundred and twenty-
eight died on the passage: of fourteen thousand
three hundred and thirty-five who arrived in 18(56.
died on the passage three hundred and eighty-nine;
and of eight thousand seven hundred and eighty-
eight arrived in 1S67, not less than one hundred and
ninety-nine died on the passage."
They further state:
" In our opinion it is of great importance for the
interest of humanity, in winch both Europe and this
country are concerned, and as a question of political
economy, that the transportation of emigrants across
the Atlantic to this ponshould bo confined to steaai
vessels, as they not only convey the passengers more
comfortably and land them in better health, but, in
consequence of tho regularity and rapidity of the
passage, save an immense amount of labor lor their
own benefit and that of this country.
"One ot the greatestsources ot the nation's income
in wealth and population has been the vast emigra-
tion Irom Europe, and it should, theiefore, bo pro-
tected by appropriate national legislation. Every
principle of public policy looking to tho welfare of
the country, as well as every senumentof humanity,
demands this at the hands of Congress.
"Under the present s%stem the emigrants are
treated more like beasts of burden than like human
beings, starved and crowded together in ill-venti-
latea, ill-fitted, ill-supplied, and ill-manned vessels.
"The arrival of an emigrant ship in our ports, if
it does not bring disease and pestilence among us.
otten occasions great apprehension and alarm, dis-
turbmgthe regular business ot ourcity, and creating
an indefinable prejudice against the worthy emi-
grant, instead ot extending to him, as he truly de-
serves, a kind apd hearty welcome.
" The Corami *oncrs of Emigration are the trus-
tees as well ol the emigrant as of the State of New
Yoik and ol the United States in general. Although
appointed by the State authority for State pur-
poses, theirlme of duty is notconfined to the bound-
aries of the State, but extends over the whole coun-
try, inasmuch as they have to encourage and protect
the emigrant until he reaches his new home. It
would betray a narrow-mindedness, of which no
member of this board is guilty, if they did not look
at emigration from this national point of view.
Whenever they succeed in doing away with a griev-
ance or achievinga result favorable to the emigrants
it is a national gain, and an advantage won for the
whole country.
" Hence every consideration in relation to the com-
fort and protection ot the emigrant is of a national
character, and demands the serious attention of a
good and enlightened statesmanship.

"New York, January 21, 1808."
The value to our country of these emigrants
cannot be overlooked nor overestimated.
Many thousands of good men are prevented
from coming here on account of the horrors
of the sea voyage in being confined in these
miserable ships used for this purpose, about
which there has been so much complaint of
late. The Commercial Navigation Company
intend to meet this difficulty and so construct
their ships as to make it comfortable for emi-
