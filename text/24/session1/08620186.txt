¡Sufferers by the New York Fire—Mr. Graves.
Ho. of Reps.
i<! observed in the fiscal concerns of a wise, pru- !l
d nt, humine, md ]iist privateindiv ulual, should
contnl and neníate the tuiantial optrations of
evtiv Govt rnnit nt, vv lit re the inter*  t and hap-
pim-s of the grtat ma's ot the people are the
paramount considerations Henee, we should
adopt the same process of anah sis, the same
niKs ot investigation, in arriving at the relative
nehts of the Government, and suih of its citizens
as ire embractd by the provisions of this bill,
as though it were a matter between two indi-
viduals
His second ground is, that it is the interest of
the Government, aeting as a prudent creditor, to
extend the proposed credit, in order the better
to secure the collection of her debts The Gov-
ernment holds the bonds on its citizens for duties;
and when they tall due, it has a right to expect
pajment, without some surlieient eause against
it The raerihant, m the present instance, says
to his Government \ou hold my bond due on
such a day, for such an amount, for duties; from
an unexpected misfortune I am, in some degree,
cnppU>d in my commercial operations; and it will
be vour interest to indulge me for four years
after mv bonds become due, without interest, in
order that your debt may be the better secured.
Ought not the Government to act as any other
prudent creditor, and say to its debtor You must
give me some evidence, in addition to your own
suggestion, that it is my interest thus to act'
Would not any prudent private creditor require
other proof than the statement of his debtor be-
fore he wou'd thus prolong, for four years, the
t.me of the payment of his debt, and that,.too,
without interest' Bern?, then, altogether without
proof that it is its intertst to extend this credit, I
think the Government on this account alone ought
not to do it
1 wi'l conclude mv remarks upon this branch
of the subject by asking whether it is supposed
by any fru nd of this bill that one of those im-
port rs would agree to extend a credit of four
years without interest for the price of a quantity
of goods purchased of him in New York by a
merchant from Louisville or Cincinnati, and lost
by the purchaser in descending th  river, or by
fire after they had reached their destination ' Un-
less he had satisfactory reasons to believe it was
his interest, he would be just as far from doing
tins as i high-minded merchant from a western
city would be from asking it, or receiving it if
offered
All who have assumed to represent the feelings
of the merchants of New York, embraced by this
bill, have expressly disavowed, on behalf of those
merchants, a desire, or even willingness, to ac-
cept of the proposed measure, as a favor, boon,
or chanty from the Government   They say they
rest this claim upon its intrinsic justice, that it is
founded in correct principle, and demand of us,
as a matter of right, the passage of this bill; to
prove which, they assume that the importer is a
mere agent of the Government, that the bond he
executes for duties is executed under a sort of
legal restraint, that his contract is not voluntary
Both   of these  positions   I  consider altogether
untenable.    The importer cannot, in my concep-
tion, be understood to sustain to the Government
the relation of an agent to his principal     It cer-
tainly cannot be, as the supporters of this measure
have contended, that the importer sustains to the
Federal Government the relation that the collector
of the revenues in the States does to the State
governments.    The collectors of the ports, as I
understand it, answer to the place of the collectors
of the revenues in the States, and the importer,
to every intent and purpose, answers to the place
of tax-payer
The collectors of the revenues in the State gov-
ernments have no right of property in the taxes
they collect, and are in strictness agents, just as
much as the auctioneer is the agent of the owner
of the goods which he sells. An agent has no
right of pioper'y in the article the owner has
p! \rcd in his hands, the nwni rhastheentire right;
and thu° the one is rasily distinguished from the
oil r Is nr r the importer, then, to every possi-
b!f ii if nt, the ovv nt r of li i imported goods ' Can
hi not k (p and use the m himself, or ictiil or
wholesale them out, or rr fusf to do either at his
own option '   None can deny this, and if so, how
on it be contended that the importer sustains the
relation to this Government of a meie agent' It '
rially seems to me the position is too self evi-
dently fallacious to be susceptible of elucidation
The gentleman from Massachusetts conti nils that
it is the spirit and intention of the law that the
consumer, and not the impoiter, should pay the
duty, and hence, before the goods an sold to the
consumer, if they are destroyed by fue, or other
accident, the importer should be releised from
the duty Now, whilst I readily admit the piac-
tKdl effect of imposing duties upon importations
in this as in every other countiy is, that the
consumer pays it, l do deny that there is any-
thing in the spirit and meaning or policy of the
laws imposing duties on importations that re-
quires a sale by the importer, or a consumption
of the article imported, before the Government
•has a right, injustice and in law, to exact its
duties.
When an importer introduces a foreign article
into this Government, he acts with a view of
making a profit by it. If it be in great demand,
he perhaps makes a heavy profit: if in less de-
mand, his profit diminishes in the same propor-
tion. If it be in no demand, he perhaps fails in
his sale, and loses upon the article He makes
his importation with a full knowledge of all his
risks, and only does it because of his conviction
that the prospect of a good profit is greater than
the probability of a loss His is a chancing bar-
gain, and if he lose by it, nothing but just one
of those contingencies which in the nature of
things must occasionally occur, has transpired,
and he has no just ground of complaint Sup-
pose an importer introduce a quantity of some
article subject to become worthless, and after he
enters it, and gives his bond for the duty, it
actually becomes worthless, will it be contended
the importer shall be released from the duty be-
cause the article had not gotten off his hands
before it spoiled' Surely none will so contend.
As well might it becoiuended, that if such article
had enhanced in value the Government should be
entitled to the increased value Such risks are
incident to the nature of the business, and every
rational man who engages in it so calculates, and
lays his profits accordingly
I do not consider that the profit or per cent,
which the importer makes upon his importation
is the consideration that supports and renders
valid the bonds given by him for duties, but it is
the privilege of importing, and taking the chance
of making a profit, that constitutes their real con-
sideration The Government does not undertake
to guaranty to the importer a sale of his imported
goods, or a profit upon that sale. None, it is to
be presumed, will contend that the importer who
has failed to realize more than cost and carriage
for his cargo shall claim to be released from the
duties he owes his Government, because he was
unable to make a sale covering cost, carriage,
and duty
The consideration of a bond for duties is exactly
analogous to that of one executed for lottery
tickets, the purchaser only buys a chance for a
prize, and not the piize itself And the purchaser
of a ticket could with just as much propriety go
I to the agent of those who have made a lottery
and ask for his money back after he had drawn
a blank, as the importer can come to us, sir, as
the agents of the people, to whom all duties be-
long, and ask us to forgive him his bond, or to
extend him a credit averaging four years; for it
will be borne in mind that those who have advo-
cated this bill have avowed an intention of sus-
taining another bill to release the duties on all
goods that were destroyed in the hands of the
importer, and no small proportion of their argu-
ments have borne on this question. But, further
to elucidate my understanding of the practical
operations of the chancing bargain of the ira
porter, suppose those sufferers by the fire in New
York had, since the fire, imported Tiench goods
to the value of $90,000,000, and a war with
France, or a total exclusion of all Fiench goods
from our poits, had been determined upon by
Congress—wou'd not those importers have felt
themselves entitle d to all the advantages acciuing
to them in sucha contingency' Would they not,
as sensible men, have improved their fortuitous
position to make a much greater profit on these I
importations than they anticipated when they
engaged in the enterprise' And who would ever
think of their dividing their profits, thus gieatly
increased, with the Government, by whose ím-
midiate action those piofits were enlai<nd '
The gentleman from Massachusetts^ says, al-
though it is the intention of the kw that the con-
sumer should pay the duty, and not the impoi ter,
yet the situation of the importer is altogether
different from the merchant in Cincinnati, who
may have purchased fiom the importer, the im-
poner, being a kind of agent of the Government,
has a right to demand lus duties back of the
Government, if the goods impoitod be consumed
before sale; but if the Cincinnati merchant buy
the whole cargo, and it is consumed by file, whilst
his, though perhaps unremoved, the Government
ought not to interfere, because one is n sort of
agent of the Government, and pays the duty, and
the other does not Is this not rather a distinc-
tion without a difference' In neither case has
the article reached the hands of the consumer.
And if the gentleman's argument be good, that it
is the intention of the law that the consumer
should pay the duty, would it not as much defeat
that intention in the case of the Cincinnati mer-
chant as in that of the New York importer, and
as much in the oase of the village merchant,
who is, perhaps, the third owner, as in either
instance'
But it is contended again by the gentleman
from Massachusetts, that the laws imposing du-
ties operate as a legal restraint on the natural
right of the importer, that he is compelled to
execute his bond before he can land or enter his
cargo, and therefore the bond is not altogether
voluntary, and that in this, it essentially differs
from an ordinary bond given to a private creditor
by his debtor. There may, at first blush, be an
apparent difference in the two cases, but, on ex-
amination, I think it will be found that there is
no essential or material difference. I hold that a
merchant enters upon the pursuit of his chosen
avocation with a knowledge of the laws by which
the wisdom of the nation has regulated it. He
knows that when his ship arrives in port he has
to execute his bond, with approved security, for
the duties on his cargo, before he can land or
enter it in the custom-house With a full knowl-
edge of all this, he, as a free agent, laboring under
no legal compulsion or restraint, voluntarily en-
ters upon the business of an importer, it is to be
presumed with a knowledge of, and a willingness
to comply with, the laws legulating the imposi-
tion and collection of duties Hence, with great
deference to the opinion of the honorable gentle-
man, I cannot admit the validity of his position,
that the contract between the importer and his
Government is not entnely voluntary, and that
it differs essentially from one between a private
creditor and debtor.
Every pursuit has its peculiar advantages and
disadvantages. We find the rewards of labor in
the thousand vanous pursuits of life, from the
humble day laborer up to the most enterprising
and hazardous merchant, are generally small in
proportion to their certainty, and enlarge as they
grow more uncertain. Hence, he who is content
with the meager supply of the absolute neces-
sities of an humble life, will adopt the pursuit of
a day laborer, because the rewaid of his labor is
immediate and certain, he draws each night the
wages of the past day, and retires to his humble
dwelling to rest fiom his labor, free from all the
cares and perplexities to which others of large
possessions and multifarious engagements are
subject. He, however, who is not content with
his condition, will, perhaps, adopt the business
of a tiller of the earth, the rewards of whose
labor, though more uncertain and not so imme-
diate, are yet larger in proportion to their greater
uncertainty. An early frost or an unusual storm
may occasionally sweep from him the fruits of
months of labor, yet, as such occurrences are
rare, and the inducements in the way of profit
are great, we see the great mass of our fellow
citizens engaged in aguculture. But when the
eaily frosts come, and cut short the crops of the
farmer, he isconscious that it is nothing but what,
from the nature of his business, he had reason
occasionally to anticipate, and nevei thinks of
asking the Government to supply his loss,   bo
