join General Ferguson's division, which will operate in the rear of Sherman's column. Should he fail to do so, however, you will be notified to that effect, and when General Ferguson's division shall have crossed Pearl River, you will, in General Lee's absence, assume command of both divisions. The general wishes you to leave an efficient officer at this place a day for the purpose of collecting and taking to you all stragglers from your command.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM ELLIOTT,

Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Dalton, Ga.:

Before the receipt of your telegram of the 23d,* Brigadier-General Bate had been promoted to succeed Major-General Anderson. I hope this will meet your want in that regard and be acceptable.

Lieutenant General J. LONGSTREET,

Russellville, Tenn.:

It is needless to point out to you the difficulty of supplying corn for your cavalry from this place. If the forage is in your department it is necessary that you should collect it, as well for our use as to dperive the enemy of it. General Johnston's wants induced the instructions in relation to the cavalry belonging to his army. Your own reports as to the evils resulting from its present detached condition were also remembered. According to the returns received, Martin's command numbers less than half of the cavalry force now with you, and Hodge's brigade, which should by this time have reached you, should restore your cavalry force to about three-fourths of its strength before detaching Martin. If you require still more cavalry, it has better be furnished to you in other modes than by the disorganization of Wheeler's command-say Morgan's command, reorganized, or some other.+

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
