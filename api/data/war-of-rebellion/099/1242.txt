General R. E. LEE,

Petersburg:

Holding one corps in Hoke's front, the enemy has thrown another to the west of the Cape Fear, which is now opposite the town. This compels me to cross the Northeast River or they will be in my rear to-morrow. Our small forces renders it impossible to make any serious stand. We are greatly embarrassed by prisoners, the enemy refusing to receive them or entertain any propositon. General Orders, Numbers 4, Adjutant and Inspector General's Office, already complied with.
