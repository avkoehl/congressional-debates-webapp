Commit ee on Military Allans The former re-
commended the augmentation of the army to the
number of 14,000, the latter to only 11,500 He
had voted for the smaller number, because he
saw no necessity foi so large an increase as was
proposed by the Senate There was no need tor
augmenting at all the existing staff, of the army, as
reported by the Senate, all he asked was, that the
rank and file should be increased in number This
he demanded of the House as an act of mere jus-
tice The House had placed on the western fron-
tiei a body of Indians mustering not less lhan
66,000 warriors, as will be teen by t! e lecort of the
CommibSioner of Indian Aflairs—an officer distin-
guished for his ability and integrity Whole num-
ber of Indians west of the Mississippi river,
332,498, estimated warriors, 66,499 No matter
by whose advice or policy this had been done, it
was too late now to inquire into that, certainly, it
never had been done by the suggestion, or with the
consent, of the representatives of the people of Ar-
kansas or Missouri They had opposed the plan
from the beginning One of his colleagues in the
Senate, then a delegate, opposed it on this floor and
elsewhere. But without reverting to the past, the
fact now was that those Indians is ere there, the
Government had sent them there, and it was the
duty of Government to provide against their hostile
operations
He would remind the gentleman fiom Kentucky,
[Mr Poi*.,] and from Virgmu, [Mi Wue,] that
the Indians on the Arkansas frontier were not
such Indi u>s as Clark and Harmar had fouBht
These Indians were all fully armed, each one of
them was furnished with as good a rifle as any of
our own people, and they were well supplied with all
the munitions of war, and whit was ihe rnumen-
cal iorce' There were 20 000 Cietks, 15,000 Choi-
taws, 10,000 Cherokees, besides some 5,000 Osiges,
and some 1,500 Chiekasaws, and how many Semi-
nóles would d< pend upon the final results of the
Florida war
Now, he did not wish to be understood as taking
the position that the people of Arkansas stood m
dread of these Indians., however numerous they
might be, as of a superior foe, from whom they
fled lo the Government for piotection No, if
matters ever came to extremities, the people he
lepresented were both able and willing to defend
their own homes, and to protect then own wives
and children But the danger «is not a personal
or peculiar one, in whichthev alone had in isolated
and independent concern It was the danger and
the concern of the country at laige, and it uas ¡he
duty of ihe whole reople of the Union to guard
against it TI e people of Arkansas demanded
protection not as a boor, nut as a giatuity, not out
oí pity, bu as a matter of light to her own citizens,
and by tieaty stipulations with the Indians He
appealed on this subject alike to gentlemen on both
sides of the House Would thty be wilhn„, on
account oí any political or party brani gs oí this
question, to stand by and see their fel'ow citizens
scalped and tomahawked' Would ihey have them
exposed to the dangei of such a fate, merely for
the sake of saving a little money' No He had
a better opinion of the lepiesentauves of the Ame-
rican people He \as sur  that both the friends
and ihe opponents of the Administration wou'd
freely vote whatever might rea 'y be reouisite in
this matter
M Y was well aware of what were the feelings,
the apprehensions, and the desires of his people at
home They all fully expected an Indian war,
they had no doubt that it was coming, and in that
expectation, it would be their desire that the
largest increase which had been proposed by either
of the amendments should be granted by Con-
gress, and they would be glad to increase it yet
farther "Vet, though he knew the e were their
wishes at the present moment, he cr uld not con-
sent to vote for the inciease proposed by the Sa-
nate's bill, he thought a smal'er eddilion would be
sufficient, and he look ne lesponsibiluy ot saying
to the gentleman from Mis oun [Mr Harrison]
that he could not go tul ti e amendment he had
proposed He proposed, and it was all he a"ked,
that five regiments of infantry and two of dragoons,
making in all upwards of 6,500 men on our wes-
tern and north western frontier, should be forth-
with raised, and this amendment will give it This
w as, m his judgment sufficient to meet the exi-
gency of the country. If the companies o' infan-
try were increased to 80 privates, this would give
a force of 5,000 infantry, and 1,450 dragoon:, for
the defence of the south western frontier He would
dispose of this force as follows He would place
in Tort Jesup, at the mouth of the Sabine, 500,
at Fort Towson 500, to protect the frontier from
ihe inroads of the Camanches and Pawnees, at
Fort Smith 500, at Fort Gibson 500, and 200 at a
post to be established in the northwest corner of
Arkansas These, with the dragoons would give
3,400 men to meet the Indian force west of Ar-
kansas
Now   let   gentlemen   consider  the  formidable
amount of the Indians which have been collected
at our western frontier    They might be reckoned
as follows
Choctaws and Chiekasaws     -       -   30,000
Creeks......20,400
Cherokees, about    -                             10,000
Osages    -                                -              5 000
Pawnees......12,000
Camanches     -               ...   20,010
What then was the condition of the frontier as
to safety7 Why, it was true, as the gentleman
from Virginia [Mr Wisf] had said, that 2a 000
men could not defend it, ii it came to a trial of ac-
tual strength, but if the Government erected a line
of posts well garrisoned, with muiual means of
easy communication between ihem, the moral el-
fect on the minds of the Indians would operate as
a sufficient defence, and prei tnt hostilities But let
war once actually break out, and twice the n umber of
troops would afford no effectual resistance The
Indians were more lhan two to one The Chero-
kees lay within half a days march of some rf the
stiongest counties in Ihe State, in ten days the In
dians, if united, could drive every thing befo e
them, and take Little Rock, the «eat of Govern-
ment The militia would have tobe called out,
but they would not check their progress to the Mis-
sissippi nvei This w as no dream of the imagina-
tion The Indians, it appeared from late advices,
were planting no com, and some of them had
burned their fences, and they declared to t^e
whites, that at the time of their gieen corn dance
they would finally determine whether to make
war or no The President had been ap-
prised of this stite of things, and if he believed it
to be true, as Mr Y did, he ought to draw off some
troops fiom elsewhere If, as the gentleman from
Massachusetts [Mr Rikd] had said, the troops
were not wanted on the Atlantic seaboard, send
them to the West, wheie the) really were needed
Under this view of the case, Mr Y had been wil-
liiig to vote for one additional regiment, as pro
posed by the present amendment
The force at piesent on the frontier Mi   Y
stated as follows
Men at Fort Tow son, some      -       -    200
"   at Fort Gibson, say          -       -    400
" at Foit Jesup - - - - 200
with i portion of the regiment of dragoons, in all,
about 1000 men The garrison at Fort Gibson
was no piotection to Arkansas with her present
force , so far from it, that they had been obliged
to send out three ba lalions of \ elunteers to protect
the proteciors If this, was the manner m which
the Government meant to protect the people of
Arkansas, it would be better at once to withdraw
all the United States garrisons, and le„ the people
fight it out themselves If they were not to have
enough troops to do any good, better take away
what were there, and not oblige the people of Ai-
kansas to dt fend the troops of the United States
Governm°nt There had been a selection of tn o
posts to defend Arkansas and Missouri He won'd
give them 2000 infantry, and 1450 dragoons for
¿Missouri But tne honorable gentleman from Mis-
souri must leneml er that the Indians west of his
State wculd not have to be fought till those in
Arkansas had been met first The pet pie of Mis-
souri would not be troubled till the people of Ar-
kansas had been attacked He was willing to give
his fríen i from Missouri two regiments, and then
let the dragoons be divided     Let Arkansas have
one regiment, and Missouri another Theie were
a body of 66,000 Indian -warriors to be met, as he
had before stated, all well asrmed with the best of
rifles, and with plenty of ammunition. Was not
the country bound to provide .some addition to the
army to meet a force so formidable?
Mr Y. said that, perhaps, he was willing to put
up with too little, but he was the more willing to be
content with a small increase, because he w«U
knew the ability, zeal, and energy, of the present
Governor of his own State That excellent of-
ficer would never be wanting to bis duty, and if it
did come to hard fighting, be rather thought they
would whip these Indians a little sooner than Un-
cle Sam had whipped those in Florida, and at
much less expanse
He was willing to give two regiments to the
Northern frontier, from Detroit to Maine He
believed this would be as much as would be needed
in that quarter.
It must be remembered that they in the West
had no artillery, all the cannon were on the sea-
boaid. They might be taken, some of them, to the
Northern frontier, and if the force he had named
was insufficient, he would consent to raise one more
regiment, as proposed in the amendment ot the
committee
He believed that the Northwestern and North-
eastern frontier needed additional regular trorps,
but not very many, unless Maine was determined
to rise up and take by fi rce the portion of her ter-
utory now unhwfull) hel 1 bv the British When
it came to that, he was «llling to )ote her ¿5,000
men, if necessarj, but, as nutters now stood, the
people on the Northern frontier had as many as
those on the Western
In taking the ground he had done in relation to
this bib, it must be rcollected that he did not cal-
culate on an) further provision f<r the uar in
Flonda If ihey could not get along with the
Seminóles without more troops, ltt them try the
virtue of militia and volunteers One thing was
perfectly certain we must keep the body of west-
ern Indians in awe, or we should have war just
as surely as the sun would rise As long as the
Government kept the Indians there, they must fur-
nish forts and soldiers to keep them in order This
was necessary, also, to restrain evil minded whites,
and to keep them from intruding and imposing
on the Indians A military force was as necessa-
ry to keep the whites off the Indians as the Indians
off the whites
What the gentleman from Virginia [Mr Wist]
had said about Indian agents was, m general, tiue
enough But Mr Y knew of at least one bright
exception, and that was the United Sta es agent
among the Choctaws That gentleman had been
oa to this city lately, and during his absence the
Choctaws had met the Chiekasaws, the Cherokees,
and Ihe Creeks n council, and weie likely to unite
with them in an) hostile movement that might take
place
What he had asked was le^s, he knew, than his
people expected, but he should persuade them to
be content with it, at 'east, he should try The
Indians were two to one against them, and better
armed than they They would Ime, in the first
place, to get their wives and chi'dren across the
Mississippi This was the firs! thing a Western
man cared about And by the time lhat was done,
the Indians would have possession both of Arkan-
sas a id M's^oun After that they would face
about and dme tie Indians bejond the Rocky
Mountains But before it came to lhat, and to
prevent, if possible, the commencement of hostili-
ties, it was no moi" than a matter of sheer justice
that the Government snonld send there a compe-
tent military force, ?s lie had every reason to be-
liev e and hope they were disposed to afford
