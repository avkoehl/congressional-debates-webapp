one third to one-tenth of the quantity surveyed and
brought into market
Mr President, as a large portion of the public
domain was acquired by cessions from the several
States which claimed "Western territory, I have
thought it well to look into the early proceedings
upon the subject, to understand the inducements
held out, and the motives which probably operated
to produce those relinquishments The earliest ac-
tion of the Continental Congress seems to have
had little or no reference to revenue, or profit, but
to have been prompted by political considerations
of much higher import The first document ema-
nating from that Congress, which I have been able
to find, is the report of a committee, having mani-
fest relation to discontents and jealous es amongst
the States, threatening the peace and harmony of
the Union, which was adopted on the 6th of Sep-
tember, 1780 In that report, it was advised and
agreed "to press upon those States, which can remove
the embarrassments respecting the Western country, a
liberal surrender of a portion of their territorial claims,
since they cannot be preserved entire, without endanger-
ing the stability of the general Ccnfedeiacj, to remind
'hem haw indispensably necessary it is to establish the
Federal Union on a fixed and permanent basis, and on
principles acceptable to all its respective members, how
essential to public credit and confidence, to the sup-
port of the army, to the vigor of our councils, and
success of our measures, to our tranquillity at
home, our reputation abroad, to our very exist-
ence as a free, sovereign, and independent peo-
ple," &c
On the 10th of October, of the same vear, the
Congress passed a resolution, declaring "th?t (he
unappropriated lands that might be ceded or relin-
quished lo the United States, b5 any particular
State, pursuant to the recommendation of Con-
gress of the 6th daj of September last, shoulu be
disposed of for the common benefit of the United
States, and be settled and formed into distinct Repub-
lican States, which should become members of the Fede-
ral Union, and have the same rights of sovereignty,
freedom, and independence, as the other States," &c.
By a resolution adopted on the 18th of April,
1783, Congress renewed the recommendations to
the States contained in those of September and
October, 1780, to make the liberal cessions therein
recommended "as a further mean, as v ell of has-
tening the extinguishment of ths debts, os of esta-
blishing the harmony of the United States, &c " And,
again, on the 29th of April, 1784, that body adopt-
ed a preamble and resolution, referring to those
which have already been mentioned, alluding to
the national debt, growing out of the war wmch
had been happily teimmated, and again resolving
that the said States (having Western territory,) be
earnestly pressed by immediate and liberal ces-
sions, to foi ward these necessary ends (the extin-
guishment of the debt of the Revolution,) and the
harmony of the Union "
Now, Mr President, although the extinguish-
ment of the national debt is presented, m the two
last resolutions, as an inducement to the cessions,
recommended, is it not apparent that other and
higher considerations prompted the action of Con-
gress' That subject is not distinctly brought to
view in any of the otner resolutions, « hile we find
prominent, m ail of them, patriotic expiessions cf
sentiment m regard to removing embarrassments aid-
ing out of^teri itonai claims in the West, promoting the
stability of the general Confedeiacy, establishing the
Federal tmio  on a fixed and permanent basis, and pi c-
sening the harmm y of the United States These
were the paramount considerations, which were
again and again uiged upon the patriotism and
liberalit) of those States, having or claiming ex-
tensile territory They were too large—they pro-
mised to be too powerful hence the jealousies and
apprehensions ot the smaller ones, and the fre-
quent and earnest appeals of Congress, to remove
the cause which so much threatened our tranquillity
at home, and our reputation abroad
The resolution of October, 1780, also contains an
express pledge, which is, perhaps, implied m all the
others, that the territory which might be ceded or
relinquished, should be settled and formed into dis-
tinct Republican States, wh ch should become
members of the Federal Union, and have the same I
rights of sovereignty, freedom and independent, as
the other States, and, judging from what lollowed,
the harmony of the Union and stability of the Con-
federacy being restored and established by the mere
acts of cession, nothing remained to be done by
this Government of as much interest to the ceding
States, as the performance of this solemn covenan'
Although all the States which relinquished tern-
tory, stipulated m substance that the lands s0
ceded should be considered a common fund, for the
use and berefit of such of the United States as had,
or should become, members of the Confederation,
there is not an intimation that they shall be made,
through all time, one of the great sources of reve-
nue, much less that the most inferior should re
sold at as high a price as the most fertile If such
an idea had then been suggested, as refusing a
home on the public domain to those who had fought
the battles of the Revolution, and, by blood and
peril, achíes ed the liberty and independence of ih"ir
country, or to their descendants, for a moderate
pr'ce, or, perhaps, without ary price at all, the en
lightened and warm-hearted patriots, ei her m the
councils of the States or the nation, would have
revolted at the proposition Sir, such a proposi
tion would not then have been entertained, and if
anv who were members of Congress m thos  times
of high-toned patriotism, were witnesses of the
violent opposition now made to every measure
tending to ameliorate and liberali7e the terms rn
which the cu'tivator of the soil may obtain for
actual use limited portions of the public lam s and
the pertinacity with which some gentlemen hold r n
to ev erj fraction of a dollar m the price, thej w ou d
be filled with astonishment ^o, sir the amount
of money to be realized frorr the 'emtory rel r-
qmshed, was not the chief or conlrolhrg meen i\e of
the States which made the cessions Whilst h 
refer generally to a deposition of tie cede' l-> r*s
for the common benefit, the} st púlate for no st1 Cu!
advantage to themselves thev content then seh es
with an equal participation n the fund to be de
rived fiom them. But, sir, they a'l show a lauda-
ble anx:iety to restore and preserve the harmonj oí
the Union, by putting down all controversy amongst
the States about territorial claims, and to establish
and build up other free, happv, and prosperous
communities.
The State of "Virginia, perhaps, relinquished
more terntory than all the other States in
the Union , and in this, as m every thin? else con-
nected with the earlv historv of our countrv, ma n-
tained that elev ated character for pa'no'i m, and
that surpassing devotion to the harmony of the
Union, and stability of the Confederacy which

Now, sir, every leading inducement which was
1 Hd out by this Government, or influenced the
States to malte relinquishments, has been accom-
plished    The debt incurred by the war of the
Revolution has been extinguished.   AH the con-
flicting territorial claims,  which threatened the
peace and tranquility of the Union, have been set-
tled, and harmony has been restored.   New States
have been formed out of nearly alt the territory
acqu red from the original ones, or from foreign
Governments, and admitted into the Union.   From
thirteen States, and three millions of inhabitants,
we have become twenty-six, and number fifteen
m llions of souls    From a few feeble colonies,

declare, "by an ordinance, irrevocable without the
conser* of the United States," that we "forever
dis-'am all right and title to the waste and unap
propriated lands Iving withm" our limits, "and,
moreover, that each and every trict of land sold
