Sir, they would have been unworthy of their noble
parentage if they had done less.
The honorable member from Mississippi is now
able to foretell what will be the measures of ihe
next Administration, and to state what will bs its
principles. How long has it been since the friends
of the party in power could not tell any thing
abuut General Harrisons'* principles' But now,
before he has entered upon the discharge of his
official duties, they can tell all about his measure*,
and are ready to condemn them in advance, and to
prophesy their ovei throw True and constitutional
Democracy is now m the ascendai.', and I hope al-
ways may continue so. But gentlemen need not
"lay the flattering unction to their souls" that the
spoilsmen will agam come into powei Locofoco-
ísm, agrananism, subtreaiuryism are buried, now
and forever, and the light of no íesurrection morn
mg shall ever dawn upon the grave which coven
their ignoble remains
Mr. Chairman, I thank you and the commi tee
for the kindness and attention with which you hive
heard me, and shall show my thankiulness by not
longer trespassing on your patience oi the time
of the House.
NATURALIZATION LAWS
SPEECH OF MR. DUNCAN,
Ol  OHIO,
I  the Home o/ Reptesmlatives, January 26, 1841.
The following remaik  oí Mr. Duncan, of Ohio,
m favor of an amendment of the naturalization
laws, were made m Committee of the Whole on
the Dill to authorize the issue of Treasury notes,
bat were not included in hw speech as p\Jblisned
heretofore for want of room.                  /
Mr. Duncan exhibited the bill to amend the na-
turalízala 11 laws, and said it was Ins intention to
introduce it, but lest he should not havt <iti oppoi-
tumty to introduce it, and expreso his views upon
its merits, he would claim the time and attention
of the committee while lu would submit a lew rt-
marks.   Mr D pioceeded and reinukul
What are the objects <1 tins bill? Why, sk,
they are no rnoii  nor less than tos-ecuie to those
who flee from despotism, and civil .ml religion
oppression, the «ami? rights, and a participan m m
tn« same privileges., which our ancestors secured
by their ¡light, and which they have transmitted to
us, and whuh, loo, they have tiatisniíited ti us
free oí tne trammel* an J ptetended < Id'gUions that
bound them it obedience to the mandnt s ot a Bn
tbh throne, and the d>< tale-, of a hauyhty anstoua
ey called "/he muthei country "
But what is the Government wh ch our anee-
tors have transmuted to u*' In a word it is ,1 Go-
vernment oí the peopl- Oui Government is c nli I
emphatically "the asylum oí the oppa si 1 ' 
Ours is a Government of tree institutions, aud wt
have evet regarded the elective as ihe mest valua
ble of all our free ««mutton It is the fieedo.n
of our elective franchise that makes us a fice peo-
ple, arid our Givtrnrnent a free Government.
Tne elective franchise is ai institution which forms
the principal ingredient oí eveiy free Gov rnment,
and juit m proportion to tnt extent .o which that
franchise is enjoyed in a Government, so 1, that
Groverntnent free
I have ever thought, from my eailiest attention
to the principles of Government, that the elective
franchise of this country, as it related to ioreigneii,
has been unnecessary limited and trammelled
Our naturalization laws have been, and are now,
complicated, and the time required tor foreigners
to become citizens unnecss arily prolonged The
drfficuliy and expense attending naturalization, are
incompatible wiih the name 1 f our Government,
and the nature of our free 111 umtio is It has ever
been my intention, since I have had tht honor of a
stand on this floor, at the propei time, not only to
express my decided hostility to ihe n-iiural ¿ation
laws as they now exist, but albo to e-sen my feeble
abilities to have them amended, so as to rruike ihem
conform to the character and nature of our Govern-
ment, and the spirit of our Constitutions Ii affords
me inexpressible satisfaction to have on this occa-
sion the puvilege to 1 take part in the commence-
ment of a work which has long been near my
h^art
When our Government was formed, it was, to
some extent, an experiment It was formed wi h a
trembling hand, and with fearful apprehens ons.
it was trie subject of contemptuous dens on and
malevolent ridicule to the crowned heads, and the
aristocracy of all Europe, and there were? rot
wanting many able statesmen and experienced poli-
ticians m our own country, who predicted l's
downfall m kss than half a centuiy—who predict-
ed that ours would go the way of all Republ cs
hat had gone before it Hence it is that some of
our institutions are trammeled with res ncttons,
others enlarged with powets and privileges which
do not eomport with the fres principles of asimple
Republican Governmen', and i!ie spirit and gene-
lal character of our free m Muttons Among those
are to be found a Federal judiciary for life, and
the limit  ion of the elective franchise, as applied
lo foreigners, or the restraints interwoven m the
naturalization laws, though these last pmieed
rather from legal restrictions thin constitutional
prohibition The sincere caution and p< tr otic
motives which governed and guided the greater
number of our ancestor?, will prohibit eveiy grate-
ful Amenean from reflecting upon the framers of
our Government for what he may now think an
unnecessary restraint, or a dangerous power im-
posed or bestowed upon any ot our irstitutions
Some oí our institutions were framed with an eye
to those of a similar character in the country from
which we were emancipated. Many of our cus-
toms, maxim*, and rules ol action, as w¡ II judicial
as political, common to our cou'itry, were retain-
ed, as well from an attachment to precedent as a
confidente m their utility, and a belief of their in-
trinsic worth, and it is due in gratitude to the ser-
vices and mi j- ory of our ancestors, to say that all
'Mir institutions were made as free as the experi
em e < Í the age and the nature oí cnciimstanees «it
that time would permit But it is now more
than ' halt a century" since the organiza-
tion of our Government, and the harmony
and regulan y which ha* di anguished all
its movement-, intependent of iheagency of the
restriction and embanassments whieh this bi 1 is
intend d lo remove, (and some powers ind prtvi
leges which I hope to see soon abolished) mus con-
vince every ine that many of the aDpnheiis ons
eut rtdintd that our Govunmuit mi^ht b uo
fiee" were ui'ounled An exp rietice of mire
th in fifty years of the piac'icil and successful
operation or 0 ir Republican G ¡verninent mu^t
serve to c mvmce the most dtublmg and mcudu-
loui, that th- people have every requ ^üc ful

Hence there is no longer an ' apilogy íor íetam
mi rcitrteuoiis powers or (OVil.ges incompatible
with oui fiee institutions or ptrsonal rights, which
originally had their ioundition in the wan of a
full couli ienr-e in the intell geuce, capacity, and
stability of the people for self government
There is no man now living who is imbued with
pure Republican principles, wro can desire to
see that provision of the United States Constitution
perpetuiied 01 longei continued, which secures to
tie Fed ral ju ur- arj 'heir offkes lor hf« There
is surely no advocate of equal rights anl pure
Republ can pnncipl'S at th s day, who will not
cheeifully lend his aid and v-oice to so amend the
Constitution as to limit the im° for which our
Fede-al judges sh-tll ho d their omce>
The idea of an office feu lile m a Republ can
Government, a fundamental punciple of which is
"rotation in office," s so revolting to every pa-
triotic fes ling, tha' one cannot think of it w thout
horror, who is not tamted with an dtUchment to
the p.meiples of aristocracy. The existence of an
office fir life 111 a Republican Government, is
a contradiction m terms, whi h nothing but
an unprincipled sophist and a political hy-
pocrite cati reconcile at this day, and with our
experience of the v rtaes of a Republican Govern-
ment The moment an office fo life in a Repubh
can Government is Bestowed on any one individual,
a gloom and despondency, to a eertam extent, is
cast over the prospects of svery other individual in
the community, whose qualifications and virtues
entitle him equally to the same office To admit
the necessity of a life office in our Government, i¡>
to admit the preposterous supposition that go per-
son but hf who fi Is it is qualirkd, or the truth of
the anti-republican principle, that the people, 6y
themselves or their repre enfatives, are mcapab e
oí filling offices with those who are qualified
A life office in a Republican Government is a
blight and a pohucal mildew. It is a napping,
sucking vampyre upon all ñee institutions It is
a b'astmg, fieezu.g curse upon every human pohu
cal prospecf. The secret prayer of a freedom-
loving community for an early death, is the lot of
him who ho ds an office for life in a republican
Government If I nave one wish above another,
it is that I may live to see our Constitution so
amended that no man shall hold an office for life
in our Government I hope to live to see the day
when our Constitution snail be so amended that
oui Federal Judiciary, like other men, shall hold
their offices for a limited time I have no notion
that one class of officers m this country shall ride
upon the storm of party m constitutional security,
and themselves be partisans, while all others
are idble to pensh aud sink. It the tempest of
party is to perpetually howl through this coun-
try, as it will, and does, in all Governments not
purely despotic, then let those who are partisans
be placed on the same footing If the political
ocean, long and wide as tbii Union, is to heave
from its foundation, and rock and shake, and toss
the ship ot State, let all who ride in her be made
equally liable to be swallowed in the vortex of party.
I conten t diat the principles of justice, of equality,
the na'ure of our free institutions, and the name
and character of our Government, ad unite in de-
manding that tbe Fedeial Constitution be so
amended that no office can be held fcr life in this
country. But, sir, 1 did not rise to talk about the
Fedeial jansdic ton, I rose to talk about the na-
tuiahzation laws.
Sir, the objections I have fo the naturalization
laws, consist in the time they require a foreigner
•o reside in tms counti y before he can become a
citizen, the complication in the laws themselves
and the expense and trouble they impose to be-
come a citiz-n I wish to see it put m the power
of a loreigner to become a citizen with a shorter
residencs m thi* country, with as little trouble and
e; pense as pus ible, and when he takes the oath of
allegiance, I wish htm to enjoy all the rights and
puviltges oi a nafi/e bern ciuzjn, which the Fe
deral Constitution does" not deny him So thought
rbom.is Jefferson, as is evinced in the following
