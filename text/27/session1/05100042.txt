and unimportant canals to assist forward one use-
iul work, and thus never c mpie'e aiy of them,
and if they are constantly looking to others for
loans, donation1!, and cbautab'e alms as relief, they
will remain distressed mncts longer than the com-
mencement of this and the other numerous relief
measures of this relitf Administration.
Another new project for their relief proposed by
the Secretary was to pay the S ale's 'he fourih in-
stalment under the deposite act of f836 To pay the
Slates? We owe ihem nothing. We deposed
with ihem twenty eisht rm'l.ons-, to be returned
whea cilled for; and the Secretary, instead o! call-
ing for the retain of the money, when the exigen-
cies of ijp country require it, p'opo.rs to piv  ,
them, mnt millions more. Was there any-urfius
from ¡vh ( i tn s sum was *o he tar-o' No. T.ie '
money rr.i.it be obtained by increased taxation, or
a large burthensome debt. What relief was there,
then, in mis operation? We take nine millions
from the Treasury, and to replace it, with the ex-
penses of collection, &s. we must draw ten millions
or more from the pockets of the people, by duties or
other taxes.
He sa'd ¡he only true means of relief were in-
dustry, frugality, and economy—not wild schemes
of distribution Ttie former distribution or depo-
site scheme by which th  Statts got twenty-eight
million', ua> the greatct curse t!>at ever btfr-1
them, as it led them into a'l kinds of extravagane >
and lolhes the effec's of which woa'd, m some de-
gree, be felt for a:es.
And if t.ie vilue of Sta'e stock.< beraisíd m the
end, aft r infinite d stress, it will not be for the
benefit oí ibeS'ates who <• agents havesMd sooie
of thera at thirty ana ft tty per een'. sacrfice, but
toihe benefit or reh-f and profit oí the nabob spe-
culators on both sides 01 tne Atla'iie, who hove
already bought them at a discount almoot equal to
the old soldic's ceruficates.
Coupled with this kind of relief to theS'a'es istbe
furth r operation of the  other project  of relief to
them in respect '<> their currency, 'hrongh the r«w I
Fiscal Nat onal Ba'ik, of ih'ity or hfty millions of j

as it did in the West anil Southwest from 1819 to
1824—8tMp t<iem of iheir legitimate  business   and
profits—reduce prices as i did then, ten or   twcn.y
per cent, mere, and bring to  the   hammer  an!  to
rain half tl e property   left  of tho^c  11   any way

General  Government   as Cün,u¡ca-V i-.stalmenis,
and largesses of all k'nds, is the radical and fatal
change thus introdi.eei m their   relations to that

gain* their pristine  supremacy, and   control   the i
encroachments and usurpations of ihe gteat central '
consolidated power, to which they have bent the
kaee of dependence and homage?
A great central consolidated power—thus wielding
both the purse and the sword—and thus armed
wi.h its fiscal agent, and capital enough at its dis-
posal to bribe half a continent, is to be sure to lord
it here, over atject States; but time only can show
whe'her it is not to be controlled and to move i>selt,
by the slightest nod of those merchant kings, or
mor,e ed monarchs on whichever side of the A'lan-
tic, whose influences to raise the pnces of their
Siate =tocl~s, can make pa'a'ablc measures so fa al
to the liberties end independence of the whole
country.
So much for the relief to the Sta'es

lastly advonated, on account of the rel et they ara
likely to bring to the Gener?l Government, pre-

for as a guarantee hy others, it is to re! e.e thi«
Government, by stripping it of thiee million  of its
present revenues, by adeli"g many millions lo ns
expenses, by creating a large and permanent na-
tional debt of twenty fo fo'ty millions, by virtuaby
giving nire mi hons more in ttie four h instalment
to the Sta'es, and by repealing in the Sub-Treasury
the great barrier agauist the use oi non-specie-pai-
wg banks, and depreciated, irreieemab'e bank pa-
per, to destny our crtdit, and cause puolic as
well a? private losses to an lrc-lculable amount.
This is the relief to the General Government.
I, ¡or one, s->y, as respects my individual, State,
or United S'ale  lelations, I ask no such political
nostrums—no relief, except ja the o d fasvonrd
mole oí gri a'er íru.r¡>li > in exienies—greater

Mr. B b"'ieved that the gen'iempn v.hose cor-
reüpondence was the subject oi discussion, and who
might be consideied thiefiy interested in it, (the
Secretary of State) wonli ht'i- no oljecnon to
•his discus ion, neither to i s cbarac er,iioi the tiaie
it would consu ne. That sentlcmaa had done, at a
former extra session, infinitely moie than it was
proposed to do now. Mr. B. so >ke of the ex'ia
sesión of May, 1813, called by'Mr. Madison to
prov.de means of eanving on the war, and so large
a proportion of which was consumed in partisan
attacks upon the character and measures ef the
Administration,   Mr. B. was a young man at that
time, a visiter at Washington, and often ti ok his
stand among other visiters in the crowded and
heated lobby of the Honse. Standing in that
p cce, he saw a Representative from the Sta>e
of New Hampshire, now the Secretary State,
[Mr. Webster,] submit his celebrated resolu-
tions sgatnst the administration of Mr. IVia-
dison ; and during the montn which he re-
pained at Washington, he he^rd these reso-
lutions deba'ed, day m and day out, by the whole
phalanx ef the Federal party, to the exclusion of
the busme s for which Congress was called to-
gether, and to the delay of the «upphes which t*ie
invaded and bleeding condition of the oountry so
imperiously demanded. II1- heard the miner of
i'ie >es< 'unons del ver hi«¡ withering denunciations
against his own Government; he saw him fo'lowed
by the solid column of the Federal banalion then
in the House; he saw the Democracy, patient and
foitearing, "ivmg them all the time they would
ask, and all the scope they would take; and no one
availed himself more fully of Democratic for-
bearance than the mover of the resolutions himself.
He had time and scope lo his heart'  content in at-
tacking his own Government, and that in time of
war, and at a c-illed session of Congress. The
rscolltetioii of this must have its effect upon the
m.nd of him who wa? ihen th? subject of so much
forbearance He mu-i be willing, and even
anxious, to extend to olhers the indulgence of which
he has had the benefit. He must be willing that
those who please should have their time and scope,
(stthis ex'ra s s?ion of Coi.gress, called m lime
of p-^aeo to tgke niap judgments on the Ame-
rican peopie,) lo arra.gn an act of his, in which,
now as near tb'r y yeais ago, he has ihe mufor-
tnne to appesr on the wrong ,-ide of his country's
cau'e.
Mr. B. said the history of our country contained
a warning lesson to gentlemen who take the side
of a foreign country against their own: he alluded
tj the case of Arbuthnot and Ambnster, seized
among the Seminole Indians in 1818, and hung as
outlaws and pirates by the orders of General
Jackson. The news of that execuuon was heard
with joy by the American people, wh> considered
tbe^e Englishmen as a thousand times more cal-
pable thin the wretched savages whom they stimu-
lued to tb.3 murder of women ai,d childien, and
who had abandoned their own cou dry, and the
white race to which they belonged, to join sivages
against a country with which iheir own Goverr-
mtnt was at peace. The country h ard the news
or the exeeut'on with joy: tix_y approved t!ie act
of Gonial Jackson. Not so wnh the politicians
—'h  pon íciatis of the Federal icnool c-pecially.
T..ry cor demned i'; partisan presses a*tacked it;
and when Congress met, committees of each House
of Congress reported a ;amst if—loudly condemned
u—and were folio ved by a cowd of speakers.
All the phrases now h ard in claiming exemption
for McLeod, and bewailing his fate, weie then
Ik ard ¡n deploring the fate of Arbatbnot and
Ambnsier.    Violation  of th" laws of nations—
iiihumai—unwoitl-y of the nineteenth century__
th cting to humanity—barbarous—uncivilized—
subjecting us to reprisals, and even to war from
England—drawing upon us ihe reproaches of
Canstendom, gfid even the wn-ta of Heaven: such
were the holycay phrases wi'h which 'he two
Houses of Congress then rejounded. To hear
what was ssid, and it would seem that the British
lion would be msunt'y upon us. Wc were tau°ht
to trcmb e for the leturn news fiom England.
Well! ,t came1 and unar was u? 2 Tor one word
from the Bnti h Government again-t the ac1 of
Jackson ! Not Ihe scrape of a pen from a Mini*
tei on the subj-et' Not a word m Parlia-
ment except tnc unsuppoiled complaint of .soma
solitary members—just enough to show, by the
indifferer.ee w.ta which it was received, that the
Bnfisn House oi Commons h?d no condemnation
to pionoume upon ihe c induct of General Jack-
son. Tneir silence ju-tmed him in Ergland, while
ommittees and oraiors condemned him here; and
ihis justification from abroad, in a case where two
Englishmen were actually hanged, should be a
warning to gentlemen how they should commit
themselves in a case where an  Englishman is
