HDQRS. ELEVENTH Regiment OHIO VOLUNTEER INFANTRY,Winfield, Va., April 30, 1862.

Captain G. M. BASCOM,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Hdqrs. District of the Kanawha:

SIR: I have the honor to report that the expedition sent out from this point under Major Jackson to Mud Creek returned yesterday. It appears that after leaving Garrett's Mill, about dark on Sunday evening, our men were fired upon by a party of bushwhackers in ambush, their shots, however, not taking effect. The fire was briskly returned by our men, but with what result is not known, as it was so dark the enemy could not be distinguished or pursued. On Monday morning some of them made their appearance, but ran on the approach of our troops. These men-of whom there are supposed to be about 100-traverse the country in small gangs and rally together upon notice given them by citizens of danger; this, at least, seems to have been the case during the recent expedition. (I would state that our men did not pursue the usual route of travel.)

The distance from this place to Garrett's Mill is about 25 miles; it is some miles nearer Guyandotte than Winfield.

Subsistence taken from citizens was receipted for by Major Jackson. Inclosed I send charges against two men-Jacob Douglas and A. McLain-sent here from Coalsmouth by Lieutenant Young. Please inform me what to do with the prisoners.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. H. COLEMAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Eleventh Ohio Volunteers.
