HEADQUARTERS HARRISON'S BRIGADE,April 17 1865.

General WHEELER:

Various rumors have just come into camp regading the surrender of the army, which has already induced some men to leave, and it is probable that others will do so in the course of the night, and I therefore desire that you will be kind enough to furnish me by the return courier the latest authentic intelligence on this subject.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BAXTER SMITH,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
