upon the identical matters in controversy Mr
B held, upon these facts, that the bank directory
weie Self convicted of their contumacy to the
llouseof Representatives,ai d as good as convicted
of all the matters laid to tneir chuge and that it
was assUiiing an immense burden upon itself, foi
the Senate to go on to vote a íestora ion of the

unfounded the chaiges against the bank ' which
virtually pronounces the opinion of the Senate on
all the questions depending between the House
and the bank, and thiows the weight of thai,
opi non into the scale of the bank '
Mr B called the attention of ihe Senate to an
othei point in which the body of the directors, in
then answerto Pitsidenl Jackson's cabinet paper,
had made a charg  against him, when, if true,
would not only degrade and dishonoi h m person
ally, but entnely annihilate the influence of his
name anu opinions against the Bank of the United
S ates It was a charge of having attempted to
make the bank subservieru to hm po itical views,
and then turning against it becaus  he could not
thus use it The charge was specific, with time
and place, and would be lead "Iluasm themidit
