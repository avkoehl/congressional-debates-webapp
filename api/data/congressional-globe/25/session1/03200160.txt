large payments and remittance1!, we should enjov
the conveniences of a sound, convertible paper
medium In regard to those distant uses which
call for a medium of general and Uniform credit,
the occasions of them are either trav ellmg or re-
mittances But foi tiavellmg, there could be no
medium of more umfo m and general credit than
the gold coins, which, in the case supposed, could
always be had withoutdifficulty, while they would,
at the same time, be perfectly poir>ble and oonve-
ment. As to distant remittances, they are hardly
ever made in monev of any soft, but are effected
thn ugh drafts and bills of cxcringe , and when
the local currencies within their íespecüve sphere*
shall be raised to par v nh specie, the rates of et-
cha"<tc, with the advantages of «o portable a cur-
rency as gold to adjust balances between the States,
would be next to nothing—ceitairiyas chfeap as
it has ever been under the regime of a national
bank.
Among the most important advantages of such
a constitution cf the cmiency as is contemplated
by this bill are the substantial stcurit es it would
afford against the peculiar dangers and evils of the
banking sjstem Those evils are a tendency to
oi er-issues of paper, fluctuations in the quantity of
currency and m the value of property as affected
by them, and the liability to a suspension of specie
payments. The ¡suppression ol the small notes
■would operate, in two ways, to check oi er-issues
In bringing a Iarg°i quantity of gold and silver into
circubtion, it would, of course, diminish in the
same proportion the issues of paper to form a part
of the circulation The number of issuen, too,
would be diminished, for, the «mall note circulation
being a consideiable souice of profit, its suppres-
sion would take away one efficient motive to the
multiplication of banks Then, as to fluctuations
m the amount of the cuirency, and the often ruin-
ous fluctuations that ensue in the value of property,
this evil is greatly m< leased by the fact that, in the
existing state of the cuiiencyin this country, when-
ever an unfavorable balance ot trade eieates t
dram on the banks loi specie, having no means of
recruiting then supply but from abioad, for every
dollar of specie that is di awn from them they are
forced to draw in their own circulation to three or
four times the amount But «hen the domestic
channels are filled with gold and silver, as they
would be if the small notes vveie suppiessed, the
banks, being alwa< s able to aplace whatever spe-
cie is drawn irom them by a foie gn dram, with an
equal quantity obtained m the country, then circu-
lation remains comparatively stead} The same
circumstance, enabling- the banks to meet any sud-
den run upon them by a prompt remloiccment of
their resouices, obv lates the danger of a suspension
of specie payments, and renders such a contin-
gency next to impossible It ill bank notes under
twenty dolíais had been suppiessed, who, for ex-
ample, could suppose that, filled as the channels
of circulation would in that ca^e have been with
gold and silver, and the quantity ol bank paper
comparatively small, the banks of this country
would, m the late pressure, ha^e been compelled
to sustain specie payments'
The system of policy, then, proposed by this
bill, if carried into full execution, would secure to
the country a sound, stable, convenient, and sub-
stantially uniform currei cy—consist ng neailj one-
half of com for the diilj anl oidnmiy transactions
of life, and the residue of sound tonveitible paper,
for large operations and Commeicial purposes
Without depriving the community of am of the
advantages of the bank  g sjstem, it wouid ob-
viate the danger and cue the evils incident to that
system But the S°natoi from South Carolina,
(Mr Calhoun,) vhile acknowledging the high im-
portance of the ' cjorm contempla ed bv tie bill,
objects that ti c. means proposed loi its accomplish-
ment are inefficient Ii 'hat gentleman be right
in supposing that tne credit of lank paper is owing
to its receivabJit) in payment of the public dues,
which, he says, opeiatts as a geneial endoisation
of it by the Government, then surely the means
proposed by the bill are not inefficient What
more powerful inducements cou'd be addressed to
the banks to conform their issues to the provisions
ol #ie biH than the annunciation that, if they did
not do so, the Government would withhold from
them that which, according to the opinion of the
Senalor from South Carolina, alone gives credit to
their paper"? But, without agreeing with the Sena-
tor from South Carolina in the extent to which he
carries his views of the credit of bank paper being
solely derived from its receivability by the Govern-
ment, I still bsneve that the sanctions of this bill,
though I have never wipposed them sufficient of
themselves to fully accomplish the object, would
exert a very considerable influence on the conduct
of the banks It must not De forgotten that the
means proposed by this bill are the very means
employed by the joint resolution of 1816 to bring
the banks back to specie payments on that occa-
sion, and which, notwithstanding the previously
declared determination of the banks to the con-
trary, did bring them back to specie payments on
the day fixed by that resolution The same means,
too, were employed with success by the Secretaiy
of the Treasury, in 1815, to induce the banks to
rec ive Treasury notes (which had sustained a
considerable depreciation) at par, though they had
before refused to receive them either m payment or
on deposite.
But my reliance is not so much on the direct
operation of this measure on the banKs themselves,
as on the moral influence it is calculated to exert
upon the policy of the States, which have full and
complete power to carry its object into effect The
public mind is now universally awakened to this
great common interest of the cunency, and is
anxiously looking to Congress for the adoption of
some common system, to be acted upon and earned
out by the States, so far as their action may be
necessary to supply the defect of federal power
The States have heretofore shown no backward-
ness m seconding the policy of Congress on the
subject of the currency , but, on the contrary, have
promptly and zealously co-operated m the reforms
which have originated here, under the auspices of
the national repiesentation The promptitude with
which a majority of them have already prohibited
the issue of bank notes under the denomination of
five dollars, as soon as this Government adopted, in
its fiscal policy, the principle of discontinuing those
small issues, is an encouraging proof of the
patriotic co-operation of the States I may add to
this proof the recent example of my own State,
whose legialatuie, being in session at the time of
the passage of the currency bill by both houses of
Congress, during the last winter, immediately re-
sponded to the polic> announced by that bill, by
the enactment of a law prohibiting, after an early
period, all bank notes under the denomination of
twenty dollars There is no fear that the States will
abandon the General Government in this wise
policy of reforming the actual currency of the
country, if the General Govornment do not aban-
don them Let Congress persevere in the policy so
earnestly inculcated by the late administration, and
so warmly embraced by itself at the last session,
and that policy cannot fail to be carried on, by the
co-operation of the States, to a triumphant and
beneficent consummation Public opinion, in our
republican system especially, is the mistress of
human affairs, of government and legislation, as
we'l as every thing else Let us, by the example
of our measures heie, awaken that opinion to the
importance of the reforms v, Inch aie needed m the
currency of the country, and if it appiove them, as
w e ha\ e every reason to believe it will, it will not
be slow in finding, in some branch oi other of our
sjstem, efficient as well as appropriate organs to
work out its decis'on.
Besides the reform contemplated by this bill,
theie are others of high importance, in regard to
the soundness and uniformity of the general cur-
rency, which anadheience to the policy of the late
administration, with regard to the cmployance of
State banks in the fiscal operat ons of the Govern-
ment would afford the means of accomplishing In
what did the boasted power of the Bank of the
United States to preserve the soundness of the cur-
rency consist' Was it not in checking the issues
of the State bank , when tending to exce"S, by pe-
riodical and frequent settlements with them, so as
to keep them, to use the language of the president
of that institution, " m the habitual presence of
accountability i" The same practice has long pre-
vailed in Scotland, and constitutes, by general ac-
knowledgement, the distinguishing excellence and
chief security of the eminently successful system
of banking in that country All the banks havs
agents in Edinburgh, who regularly exchange their
no'es twice a week, and the balances are paid by
bills at ter days' date on London By this means,
over-issues are effectually prevented, and the cur-
rency of that country, though consisting almost
entirely of paper, has been preserved in a condition
of constant soundness Nothing would be easier
than to incorporate this same regulating principle
into a system of deposite banks It might be made
the duty of each of them, as a condition of their
employment, to have frequent and regular settle-
ments with all the banks with which they main-
tained relations of business, and to call, if neces-
sary, for an adjustment of the balances m specie.
This would be an efficient check upon over-issues ,
and, administered by some twenty or thirty depo-
site banks in different parts of the Union, would
exert a far more powerful and extensive influence
over the general currency of the country, than the
same check in the hands of the Bank of the United
States could have done , inasmuch as the aggregate
capital and business of these deposite banks would,
in all probability, much exceed that of the Bank of
the United States Here, then, is an object of the
highest importance, in regard to the preservation of
a sound currency for the whole country, which
might be easily and certainly aecemphshed by a
perseverance in the policy of the late administra-
tion If to that were added, as there is reason to
believe might easily be done, an arrangement
among the deposite banks to receive and credit
each other's notes as cash, whenever offered in
payment of public dues, you would secure to the
country the advantages of a convenient circulating
medium of equal and diffusive credit throughout
the nation, and possessing every attribute of the
paper of the late national bank, without its uncon-
stitutionality By thus accommodating the practi-
cal wants of the country, in regard to currency, you
wouid put an end for ever to the bitter and recur-
ring struggles for a national moneyed institution,
and would give that stability and repose to the so-
cial and business relations of the country which are
so much needed for its prosperity.
But all these high considerations, it seems, are
now to be disregarded, and a policy, announced
w nh the most confident promises of success, and
prosecuted, for more than tnrce years, with a sig-
nal fulfilment of the se promises, is to be, all at
once, abandoned, for new and untried expedients
And why this sudden change of policy 1 Because
the suspension of specie p^j merits by the banks
has occasioned some momentary embarrassments
in the operation of the system It is, therefore,
pronounced that the system has been tried and
failed, and I heard yesterday, with amazement,
the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Calhoun)
appealing to t^e friends of the late Administration,
in the confidence that, of all parties, they would
be the most certain to join him in opposition
to this system—that they who bad been the spon-
sors, the advocates, the champions of it, who were
identified with it in every possible mode of honor-
able commitment, would be the first to turn round
and abandon and disown it' Why, sir, if they
are against it, who are for it? That Senator said,
if it be folly to adopt an " untried expedient," it is
madness to employ one that has been tried and
failed But, sir, that is the question at issue Has
this system of State bank depositories failed ? I
say it has not, unless the explosion of a steamboat
would justify } ou in pronouncing the great dis-
covery of the age—the application of steam to
navigation—an imposture, or the sweeping away
of a mill by a freshet would prove that most use-
ful invention, for the subsistence of man, to be an
abortion. The recent suspension of specie pay-
ments by the banks is an accidental and an extra-
ordinary occurrence, the result, as I shall show,
of circumstances peculiar in their character and
unprecedented in their combination, and affords
no criterion by which the general utility or success
of a system is to be juáged If we wish to form a
correct Judgment of the system of State bank d*-
