August 3, moved with the line farther to the front and intrenched. The Forty-sixth Ohio, with details from other regiments, advanced and took the enemy's skirmish line, capturing many prisoners. Lieutenant John Lutz, Forty-sixth Ohio, a good and brave officer, fell mortally wounded in the charge. Nothing of particular interest has occurred since. The Twenty-sixth Illinois, Lieutenant-Colonel Gillmore, and One hundredth Indiana, Lieutenant-Colonel Heath, were assigned to my brigade August 4. The One hundredth Indiana are on duty at Marietta, and have not reported.

During the time covered by this report my brigade has been very actively engaged. Battles have been fought, and but few days have passed without the skirmish. The labor has been severe, and my little command has grown continually smaller, but severe as the labor has been, all privations and suffering have been borne in the most commendable manner. Heroes are numerous. They have performed every task with alacrity and cheerfulness. I feel proud of my command, and am satisfied they have won for themselves an honorable record.

I take pleasure in calling the attention of the general commanding to the gallant and able manner in which the following named officers not heretofore mentioned, have, by virtue of their rank, commanded their regiments: Lieutenant-Colonel Cavins, Ninety-seventh Indiana, Colonel Catterson being disabled by severe sickness; Major Clune, Sixth Iowa; Captain Post, One hundred and third Illinois; Captain Alexander, Forty-sixth Ohio; and Captain Galvin, Fortieth Illinois, all of whom have discharged their duties as soldiers. There are many others who have proved themselves heroes, but it is impossible for me to mention names in this already too lengthy report. I would respectfully call the attention of the general, in their cases to reports of regimental commanders.

To my staff, Captain Upton, Captain Watson, Lieutenant Johnson, Lieutenant Davidson, and Lieutenant Parsons, acting assistant quartermaster, I am greatly indebted for their gallant assistance.

Accompanying this you will find the reports of regimental commanders, together with their lists of casualties since Resaca.

Recapitulation of casualties since May 15, 1864.
