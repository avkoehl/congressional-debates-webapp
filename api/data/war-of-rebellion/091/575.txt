MARTINSBURG, November 8, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

Train just arrived from Winchester. Everything was quiet there when it left, but they were preparing for an attack. My scouting parties have all returned without finding a single rebel. I shall start train for the front early in the morning.

General SEWARD,

Martinsburg:

I sent yesterday 1,500 infantry to Bunker Hill - they will get there to-day - with orders to report to the commanding officer of the escort for your train. Unless you get positive information of this rebel movement start your train as usual.

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DISTRICT OF HARPER'S FERRY,Harper's Ferry, W. Va., November 8, 1864.

Brigadier-General SEWARD,

Martinsburg, W. Va.:

GENERAL: I sent yesterday to Bunker Hill 1,500 infantry. They camped last night beyond Charlestown; will get to Bunker Hill to-day. I do not think, from the locality given of the rebel command, there is much cause to think they will either attack Winchester or the railroad this side of North Mountain. If, however, your scouts confirm their approach you can call in to your command the infantry at Bunker Hill, which, with troops at your post, will give you ample force to drive them off. Unless you receive such confirmatory reports as satisfy you that it is a great hazard to do so, send forward your trains as usual. We have no information confirming Colonel Edwards' letter. Mosby crossed at Snicker's Gap night before last, but did not have more than 400 men. Send in the names for your general court-martial, and also for military commission, and I will order them at once.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
