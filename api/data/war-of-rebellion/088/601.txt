CITY POINT, VA., August 31, 1864.

Major-General MEADE:

As soon as it can be done I would like to have a column of cavalry, perhaps supported by infantry would be well, thrown out west from Warren's position to cut off wagon trains carrying supplies into Petersburg. It should be a rapid, sudden dash to gather up all the teams and straggling escorts they could find.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
