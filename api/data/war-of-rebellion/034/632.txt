JULY 1, 1863.-Affair at Christiansburg, Ky.

Report of A. C. Simpson.

CINCINNATI, OHIO, July 1, 1863.

The following has just been received from Louisville, and is forwarded for your information:

The rebel [T. H.] Hines and his party of 10 or 12 men captured the passenger train on the Louisville and Lexington Railroad, at Christiansburg, 15 miles this side of Frankfort, this morning at 8.30 o'clock. He burned the baggage, one passenger car, and cut the telegraph lines. If there are any mounted men at Frankfort they should be sent after him, and at once. He is supposed to have gone to Owen County.

A. C. SIMPSON.

I think Captain [Greenberry] Reid, of Paris, will be a proper person to send after him, and you may say to him that I will give him $1,000 if he will capture them and bring them to me.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

General GEORGE L. HARTSUFF.
