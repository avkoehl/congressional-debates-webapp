and no greater than is allowed to retired officers
of the same rank by the provisions of this act.
The next officer in rank shall be promoted to the
place of the retired officer, according to the estab-
lished rules of the service. And the same rule
of promotion shall be applied successively to the
vacancies consequent upon the retirement of an
officer.
Sec. 23. And be it further enacted, That when-
ever any officer of the Navy, on being ordered to
perform the duties appropriate to his commission,
shall report himself unable to comply with such
order, or whenever, in the judgment of the Pres-
ident of the United States, an officer of the Navy
shall be in any way incapacitated from perform-
ing the duties of his office, the President, at his
discretion, shall direct the Secretary of the Navy
to refer the case of such officer to a board of not
more than nine, and not less than five commis-
sioned officers, two fifths of whom shall be mem-
bers of the medical bureau of the Navy; the
board, except those taken from the medical bu-
reau, to be composed, if possible, (as far as may
be,) of his seniors in rank. The determination
of [he board, in each case, shall, with a record of
its proceedings, be transmitted to the Secretary of
the Navy, to be laid before the President for his
approval or disapproval, and orders in the case.
The board, whenever it finds an officer incapaci-
tated for active service, will report whether, in
its judgment, the incapacity result from long and
faithful service, fiom wounds ot injury received
in the line of duty, from sickness or exposure
therein, or from any other incident of service. If
so, and the President approve of such judgment,
the disabled officer shall thereupon be placed upon
the list of retired officers, according to the pro-
visions <^f this act; but if such disability or in-
competency proceeded from other causes, and the
President concur in opinion with the board, the
officer may be retired upon furlough pay, or he
Jjjt* shall be wholly retired from the service, with one
year's pay, at the discretion of the President; and
in this last case his name shall be wholly omitted
from the Navy Register. The members of the
board shall, in every case, be sworn to an honest
and impartial discharge of their duties; and no
officer of the Navy shall bo retired, either par-
tially or wholly, from the service without having
had a fair and full hearing before the board, if he
shall demand it.
Sec. 24 And be it farther enacted, That the
retired officers shall be entitled to wear the uni-
form of their respective grades, shall continue to
be borne upon the Navy Register, shall be sub-
ject to the rules and articles governing the Navy,
and to trial by general court-martial.
Sec. 25. And be it further enacted, That retired

as the exigencies of the public service may re-
