Commanding Fifth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report the following as the operations of the corps during the late movement on Hatcher's Run, commencing February 5, 1865, so far as they came under my observation:

We marched from our old camp between the Halifax road and the Jerusalem plank road at 7 a.m. February 5, taking the Halifax road, via Rowenty Post-Office, to the crossing of Rowanty Creek. The Sixth Ohio Cavalry had the advance of the column. At the creek we found the bridge destroyed, the stream deep and unfordable, and the crossing disputed by a small force of the enemy, who were protected by a strong rifle-pit on the opposite bank. The cavalry, deployed as skirmishers, dismounted, and subsequently Gwyn's brigade, of the Second Division, were sent forward, effected a crossing, drove the enemy away, capturing
