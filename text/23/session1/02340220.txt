AKo, that he report to the Senate the items
making up the sam of $91,658 82, which in his

made, and the banks or individuals of whom such
moneys shall have been borrowed, with the re-
spective sums due to, overdrawn on, or borrowed

Mr CLAY rose, and said he held in his hand
four resolutions, which he wished to present, and
which he was desirous should be considered at no
very di^iant day. They piesented subjects of
grave inquiry, and of deep importance, involving
the purity of the Admmistiation, if not the very
durability of tne Government The three first res
olutions assumed that the Constitution gave no
power of removal from office by the President of
the United States at his pleasure He was fully
aware that this power was conceded to the Presi-
dent by the first Congress which sat undei the
Constitution. But since that period, except in an
incidental discussion herefour or five years ago, it
has never been discussed in Congrets He had
carefully looked into the Constitution, as it related
to the power of removal in the President, and the
result was.that the power was not reposed in the
President in the instance indicated in the resolu-
tions Hi believed the assertion of the power by
the first Congiess was improvident, and not the
least reason for this opinion was the confidence
which that Congress reposed m the wisdom, the
prudence, and the patriotism of the first President,
the Fathei of his country. And, as to the prece-
dent, the fact was worthy of consideration, and,
while he conceded that it was made, he contended
that it was made with qualifications which have
been utterly disregarded by this Administration
The doctrines of this Administration and theprin-
ciples of its supporters, as avo wed in the discussion
upon the deposite question, are, that all persons
are bound to conform to the will of the President,
no matter how opposite that will may be to their
own opinion and judgment. The total number of
employees under tfte Government is estimated to
be at least forty thousand, and, if we look at the
Blue Book, where only a portion of them are re-
gistered, the estimate will be found to be much
below the true mark If we suppose that this mass
of forty thousand officers are actuated by one spirit,
governed by one impulse, and by one mind, it
would not be difficult to anticipate that the day was
not far distant when the efforts of the people to
restrain this enormous power wou'd be vain and
unavailing It was a settled axiom in free govern-
ments, that a standing army was dangerous in time
of peace That is, such an army as, being dis-
tinguished by their dress from the rest of the com
munity, wis capable of being seen and e&timated.
But how differei tfrom this was this army of forty
thousand men, dispersed over the whole country,
and obeying one common impulse, ready to íally
round and carry into effect the purposes ard ob-
jects of the Government, and how much more
dangerous than that army against which the fears
of the people have been directed And the time !
would come when, if it was not soon checked, it
would as certainly decide the succession to the
presidential chair as the Piaslonan band of ancient
Rome decided on the disposition of the imperial
crown He hoped gentlemen would soon turn
their attention to the subject seriously, examine
the Constitution carefully, and not intrench them-
selves behind one solitary precedent He admitted
the force of precedent, it was entitled to respect,
but )et it was only evidence. He therefore in-
voked gentlemen to point out the part or parts of
the Constitution which gave to the Chief Magis-
trate the power contended for. He had looked for
it m vain. The effect of the plan indicated by the
resolutions was to secure the independence of the
officer, to place him less under the control of one
man, to restóte that equilibrium in the Government
which was wanting, and which, if permitted to go
on, would lead to the total absorption of the
powers of Government by one head, to the exclu-
sion of all other departments. He was guided in
this movement by considerations of public good,
and he looked to the operations of Government,
and its effects upon the institutions of the coun-
try. He submitted the resolutions, moved that
they be printed,and made the order of the day for
the first Monday in April.
1    Resolved, That the Constitution of the Uni-
ted States does not vest m the President power to
remove, at his pleasure, officers under the Govern-
ment of the United States, where offices have been
established by law.
2    Resolved, That in all cases of offices created
by law, the tenure of holding which is not pre-
scribed by the Constitution, Congress is author-
ized by the Constitution to prescribe the tenure,
terms, and conditions on which they are to be
holden.
3    Resolved, That the Committee on the Judi-
ciary be mstiucted to inquire into the expediency
of providing by law that in all instances of ap-
pointment to office by the President, by and with
the advice and consent of the Senate, other than
diplomatic appointments, the power of removal
shall be exercised only in concurrence with the
Senate, and when the Senate is not in session,
that the President may suspend any Buch officer,
communicating his reasons for the suspension to
the Senate at its first succeeding session, and if
the Soiate concur with him, the officer shall be
removed, but if it do not concur with him, the
officer shall be restored to office
4    Resolved, That the Committee on the Post
Office and Post Roads be instructed to inquire into
the expediency of making provision by law for
the appointment, by and with the advice and con-
sent of the Senate, of all deputy postmasters,whose,
annual emoluments exceed a prescribed limit.
The resolutions having been read,
Mr BIBB" said, that in connexion with the mo-
tion of his colleague, he would move that the
debate which took place in the first Congress on
the subject of the power of removal by the Presi-
dent, tie collated by the Secretary, and printed for
the use of the Senate
The VICE PRESIDENT said, that according
to the rules, it was a resolution which required
notice, that it was appropriating money out of the
contingent fund.
Mr BIBB then gave notice that he would in-
troduce a resolution to that effect on Monday
next
Mr POINDEXTER submitted the following
resolution:             *
Resolved, That the Committee on Public Lands
be instructed to inquire into the expediency of
employing a draughtsman (by resolution or other-
wise) to make a manuscript man, from official
documents of each State and Territory wherein
the public lands are situated, to comprise the sur-
vey of the public lands, the topographical surveys,
the surveys of coasts, the post roads, the bounda-
ries of counties, and the precise location of towns,
and such other matter as is useful and usually
found on State maps, or that may be ordered by
any of the committees of this body.
Mr FORSYTH moved to take up for consider-
ation the resolution submitted by Mr Manodm,
relative to the public printing of the Senate
Mr WRIGHT made some remarks in opposi-
tion to the resolution, and concluded by moving
to refer it to the Committee on the Contingent Ex-
penses of the Senate, with a view to an inquiry
into the subject, but, on the suggestion of
Mr KNIGHT, the motion waB withdrawn,
and Mi. K then offered the following substitute
as an amendment to the resolution:
Resolved, When any message, report, or other
document, communicated to both Houses of Con-
gress, shall be oidered to be printed by the Senate,
the Secretary shall ascertain whether the same has
been ordered to be printed by the House of Rep-
