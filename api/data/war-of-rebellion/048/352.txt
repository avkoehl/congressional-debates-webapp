Cavalry, who reports that he came from Thoroughfare Gap last night, but would give no further information in regard to the enemy.

Very respectfully,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant Colonel C. ROSS SMITH,

Chief of Staff, Cavalry Corps.

P. S.-There has been a good deal of picket firing by the pickets in our front, but nothing serious has happened. The party toward Thoroughfare report that the camps of the enemy are in their front, abut 5 miles from the junction.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY RESERVE BRIGADE,October 17, 863-2.30 p. m.

I advanced to Bristoe Station and found the enemy's cavalry in considerable force. They opened two batteries of artillery on my advance. They are in a strong position. I think they are still moving to our right. The command toward Thoroughfare Gap report the gap strongly held by the enemy, and a cavalry force moving in this direction. The train has arrived with forage. My conviction is that the enemy has gone through the mountains.

Very respectfully,

W. MERRITT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Colonel SMITH.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY RESERVE BRIGADE,October 17, 1863-3.15 p. m.

COLONEL: There is a strong force toward Bristoe, as also in direction of Thoroughfare Gap. I do not think the enemy intend making a fight here. I drove them about 2 miles when they opened their artillery on us (some eight guns). It is thought Wilcox's division is in our front. They are destroying the railroad all the way through from this point. They threaten my right flank from Thoroughfare Gap. The railroad train brought no rations for the men. The command is hard up for something to eat. They have not a thing to feed on. What shall I do with my wounded?

Very respectfully,

W. MERRITT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant Colonel C. ROSS SMITH,

Chief of Staff, Headquarters Cavalry Corps.

[P. S.]-Cannot rations be sent immediately?

[Indorsement.]

General Meade directs that you make the necessary arrangements to have rations sent out by cars, &amp;c., if it has not been already done.
