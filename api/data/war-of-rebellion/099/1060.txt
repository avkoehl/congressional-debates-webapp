We can thus save Lee's communications, raise the siege of Mobile, should it be invested, or be prepared to meet Thomas when he advances in the spring. Last of Cheatham's corps, except furloughed men, will leave here on Wednesday. I find upon inquirty that this Tennessee division has been furloghed until 10th and Brantly's and Sharp's brigades until the 12 the proximo. Will report further about artillery.
