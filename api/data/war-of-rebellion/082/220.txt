Brigadier General O. S. FERRY. Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: In reply to your communication of this morning relative to the disposition of troops on the picket-line I am directed by the brigadier-general commanding to say that in making the new arrangements the 400 men spoken of by you as already present on the line did not enter into the calculation. The intention was that the 200 men from General Terry, re-enforced by at least 200 from your own command and as many more as you might deem necessary, should constitute the whole force on that line. The brigadier-general commanding directs that the arrangement suggested in your letter be adopted.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
