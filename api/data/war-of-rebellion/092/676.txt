Brigadier General W. T. WARD,

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: The First and Third Divisions are halted here awaiting the train. The enemy are in front of us, and the general deems it imprudent to push the troops farther until the arrival of the train, as it would be too much exposed. The general commanding the corps desires to have you report every two hours the location and state of affairs along the train, where your rear is, &amp;c. In dating your notes, please state hour and place.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
