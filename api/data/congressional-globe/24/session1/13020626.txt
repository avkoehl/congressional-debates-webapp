APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

24th Cong.... 1st Sess.
Fortification Bill—Mr. McComas.
Ho. of R
EPS.
piesent vear, on the contrary, it must continue I
to mciease. There is a large item that must be
athltd to tins sum. He meant the stock that we
held in the late United Statts Bank—$7,000,000;
and if tlit puce of that stock dots not depreciate
it «nist¡1 for$7,500,000,w Inch makesintheTreas-
urv, on the l>t of last Febiuarv, ,$38,175,879 91.
Tiiis surplus nui-H continue to increase-, but that
1 may not place the ¡>um too high, I will place
the customs at the same—in iound numbers,
$19,000, public lands, $15,000,000. He would
add §5,000,000 more for the increase of the sales
of the public lands, and theie was more than
that sum of an increase upon the sales of 1835
over those of 1834, which makes $20,000,000,
making $39,000,000 for the receipts of 1836. This
sum mut>t be added to that in the Treasury on
the 1st of February last, and the bank stock,
w hich vv ill fall due dun ng the present yeai, makes,
in round numbers, $77,000,000. Out of this sum
were to be deducted the present expenditures of
the Government for the year 1836, winch have
been estimated by the Secretary at $23,133,640,
including all expenditures, ordinary and extraor-
dinary.
Mr.  McC.  said  he thought this was a large
sum for an economical Government to spend in
one year.   This sum.dioppmg fiactions, taken
from $77,000,000, leaves a balance in the Treas-
ury on tlie 1st ot Januaiy, 1837, of 954,000,000,
which will  be a suiplusfund.    Gentlemen who
are opposed to  distribution have resoited to a
cunning device; they have made an estimate of
all the bills that have passed, and will pass, this
session, for the ordinary support of Government,
and for national defense, and chaiged it to the
surplus revenue that was m the Treasury on the
1st of February last, instead of charging against
the suiphis that which would fall due on the 1st
of Januaiy, 1637, and vauntinüly tell us that we
have nothing to distubute.    He said he did not
believe in  the gullibility of the people  to that
.extent.    They would delect the fallacy of those
calculations.    They seem to foiget that the sur-
plus in the Tieasury on the 1st of Febiuaiy was
the receipts of 1835, and in their eagerness to
devour every dollar of the surplus in the Treas-
ury, they overlooked an impoitant fact, that for
the year 1836about $40,000,000 must be received
into  the Treasury.    He would leave gentlemen
to reconcile these difficulties for themselves; and,
in conclusion of this part of the subject, he would
say that the bill to distribute the  sales of the
public lands does not propose to distribute any
money but what is a surplus; and if there is no
surplus, then, of course, there can be no distri-
bution.    Let the amount be little or much, Vir-
ginia was entitled to her share.   She might be
regarded as the mother of States.    View  her
splendid daughters, Kentucky, Ohio,  Indiana,
and Illinois, all independent ¡states, rising high
in the  scale  of this  Confederacy,  principally
formed out of the teintory that Virginia ceded to
this Government.    He called on the chairman to
view the present condition of the State he had
the  honor in part to represent on this floor; a
State which, fiom her geographical, commercial,
and agncultuial advantages, might be equal to
a«y in this Union; but he said she appeared to
be at least fifty years behind the age of improve-
ment.    States but of yesterday are outstripping
and leaving her far in the shade.    He would ask
what prevented Virginia from being the most
wealthy State in this Union, as well as the oldest'
Nothing but the absenre of a well arranged sys-
tem of internal improvement.    Let her central
communication be completed by the James and
the Kanawha rivers, and a lateral branch from
the southwest through  the valley of Virginia,
connecting the waters of the Mississippi with the
Atlantic sea-board at the noithern and southern
end of the Chesapeake bay; then Virginia would
be enabled to develope her full resources.    Her
rich mineral productions, her lead, her iron, her
gypsum, and her coal, hitherto locked up in the
mountains,  would  find  their way  to  market.
The fields that lay waste and uncultivated will
be newly tenanted.    Her population that is daily
escaping to the West would  be anested.    Her
country seats and dilapidated  buildings all re-
paired; her cities, towns, and villages, made to
flourish in all the glowing beauties of wealth and
prosperity. Norfolk would assume the rank of
New Yoik, and Richmond that of Albany.
He said he had no htsitancy in saying that na-
tuie had done more for Vnginia than for New
Yoik; that a finer naval depot was not to be found
on the whole Atlantic sea-coast than at Norfolk.
And when the great valley of the Mississippi
shall become her back country, nothing butPiov-
ulenee could airest her onwaid maich to wealth
and lenown; her central position gives her a de-
cided advantage over New York or New Orleans.
The city of New Orleans can never command the
vast trade of the West that will then float on the
bosom of those majestic riveis. The climate it-
self has a deletei ions effect upon the various com-
modities in the market,while the Gulf stream may
be regarded as the home of tempest. He stated,
that though New York might, by way of a con-
tinuous canal or railroad, connect herself with the
valley of the Mississippi, yet she could not suc-
cessfully compete with Virginia for that trade, fii st
because through Virginia would be the most di-
rect loute, and, secondly, because the New York
canal would be closed with ice at least four months
out of twelve. He said Vngtnia had too long
folded her arms. She begins to see that boasting
of her great men—her Hem y, whose impassioned
eloquence set the ballot'the Revolution in motion,
and her Washington, who conducted our infant
nation to honor and glory, and before whose mili-
tary piowess the Butish lion quailed—will not fill
their bellies and clothe their backs. He said he
hoped, so far as Vnginia was concerned, that we
should be able yet to present an undivided front.
He said this measure would have a happy effect
upon the ¡ocal and sectional differences of the
State, and bring them togethei, and create a feel-
ing of brotherly love so essential to the happiness
of every community.
Mr. McC. said he would, for the information
of the people of Vnginia, give them a statement
of then interest in the land bill. It would be seen
in the following table:

He said it would be seen by this table that each
congressional district would be entitled to $84,074
annually. He would ask his constituents if they
would be willing for him to vote away that much
of their money? Money that had been diawn
fiom their pockets over and above what was ne-
cessary to carry on the expenses of the Govern-
ment. He did not know how he could justify
such a vote. Would they be satisfied to be told
that it was better for them to have that money
spent in making sheds and fortifications on the
sea-board, that would, in order to keep them in
repair, increase their taxes threefold, and thereby
revive the tariff laws again' Would they be
easily persuaded that it was more to their interest
to have a million dollars of their money spent in
building a marble custom-house in New York,
already dazzled with her own effulgence-, or would
it be more consistent with their democratic no-
tions to build up a standing army in time of
peace ' He could never return to his constituents
and say in his conscience that he had lepiesented
their interests in making such a distribution of
their money.
But his colleague [Mr. Garland, of Vnginia]
said this plan of distnbution among the States
was nothing but levivmg the doctrine of internal
improvement by this Government. How his col-
league could bring his mind to that conclusion he
was at a loss to know. How the people's money,
handed over to make internal impiovements,upon
State authority, which could be regarded as im-
provements, made under the directions of this
Government, was difficult to comprehend. But
be the matter as it may, he would inform his col-
league that General Jackson was the author of
the scheme, and he hoped that his colleague
would regaid him as good authonty, as he had
recently defended this Administration in a three
days' speech. For the benefit of his colleague and
the information of the committee, he would quote
the exact woids of the President on that subject
taken fiom his annual message communicated
December 7, lb30:
" I have heretofore felt it my duty to recommend the
adoption of some plan for the distribution of the surplus
fund- winch may at any time remain in the Tr< asiiry alter
the national dtbt «hall have been pair] amone the Statt-, in
proportion to the number ol their Representatives, tobe
applied by them to objects ol internal improvement."
By this message of the Piesident it is very
clear that he proposed this plan of dividing the
surplus revenue among the States with a view to
withdraw that fund from the control of Congress,
and to destroy internal improvements by this
Government, that each State might take its just
and equal portion of the fund, and make its own
improvements. He always regarded this as a
master stroke of policy; and he would tell his
colleague that those who resisted this measure
would be found the strongest advocates for re-
viving the doctrines of internal improvement by
this Government. It was a universal sentiment
that the country must be improved; and if this
plan of making improvements by the States should
fail, it takes no Solomon to see that the scheme
will again be revived by this Government. It
will then be seen who belong to the State-lights
party, and who not; the people then will see who
have contributed most to revive the doctrines of
internal improvements by this Government, and
also the tariff, which is the handmaid of improve-
ments; for without money it is useless to talk
about making improvements.
His colleague [Mr. Garland] had stated that
the Constitution had moretofeai from the execu-
tive branch of this Government than from the
popular branch; and he gave as instances mtei-
nal improvement and the tariff. His colleague
seemed to have foigotten that both these meas-
ures came upon the country under the imposing
sanction of Executive recommendation; that if
these measures had violated the Constitution, it
was not the work of either branch separately, but
the joint work of both; and to show that his
colleague was mistaken in regard to the relative
strength of the two branches of the Government,
he would state, as soon as General Jackson took a
stand against internal improvement, although an
overwhelming majority of the popular bianch was
favorable to it, yet the whole system withered at
his touch, and so did the Bank of the United
States. On the subject of the tariff, he would say
to his colleague that he could not show any sen-
timent uttered by General Jackson that went to
show that the tariff laws were unconstitutional.
Mr. GARLAND asked leave to explain. He
said he did not assert that General Jackson thought
the tariff laws unconstrtutional, but that he him-
self believed they were.
Mr. McCOMAS said so he had understood him;
he had not referred to it for that purpose, but for
the purpose of showing in how many instances his
colleague, who entered into a general defense of
the acts of the President,differed from him in great
leading measures. He said that, whatever the
President may have contributed t« put down
the tariff, he never opposed it on constitutional
grounds; that he did contribute to do so, he readi-
ly admitted in his recommendation of a judicious
tariff. Much as the term has been criticised, it
went far, in his judgment, to give direction to pub-
lic sentiment, and prepare all classes for a gradual
