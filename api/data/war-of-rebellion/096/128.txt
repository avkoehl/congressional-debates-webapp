Richmond Examiner of the 14th contains the following:

To-day I hope to finish landing the guns, which will be all left to do. General Terry is throwing up a breast-work across the neck of land from Battery Anderson to the river.

General Terry has said nothing about wanting more men, and, I judge, is one of those who would not ask for re-enforcements unless it should be absolutely necessary. Yesterday afternoon, after landing the troops, I went with a portion of the fleet to attack the fort. Our fire completely silenced
