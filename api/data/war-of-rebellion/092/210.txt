I append hereto a series of campaign maps,* prepared by Captain McDowell, chief topographical engineer for the corps, showing the positions of the several divisions at each camp during the march from Atlanta to Savannah. These positions were laid down and the notes accompanying the maps kept by Lieutenant-Colonel Asmussedn inspector-General of the corps. The faithful and skillful manner in which this work is done present a complete and accurate view of the daily marches of the corps.

Tabular statement marked A shows the casualties of the corps by division during the campaign-an aggregate of 12 killed, 88 wounded, 165 missing. Of the missing the greater part were stragglers and small parties of foragers captured. Some few were deserting bounty-jumpers, who had reached us just before marching from Atlanta. In the case of Captain Reid. One hundred and seventh New York Volunteers, missing with a detail of forty-three men, foraging, I have ordered a special report of the statement made by a rebel cavalry officer who was of the capturing party. If these statements are true, Captain Reid behaved in a most shameful and cowardly manner, and should be dismissed in disgrace. As both officer and men still prisoners of war no proper investigation can now be made.

We captured, on the march and before Savannah, 30 officers (13 of whom were naval), 135 privates, and 14 seamen; 122 deserters came into our ranks. A tabular statement and list of officers captured prepared by Major Parks, provost-marshal, is attached hereto, marked B. # A very considerable number of prisoners were taken on entering the city, all of whom are in the hands of the post commandant and will be the subject of report by him.
