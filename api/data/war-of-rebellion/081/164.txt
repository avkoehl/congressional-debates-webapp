General HANCOCK:

I. THICKSTUN,

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, June 18, 1864.

[General BIRNEY:]

MY DEAR GENERAL: It appears to me from what I have picked up and from a desire to avoid for the corps all the artillery fire possible, that the real column of attack should be toward your left if the ground is favorable, which you will know better than I. I make this as a friendly suggestion.

Your obedient servant,WINF'S S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

The matter of the Seventh [New York] Artillery and the matter of Colonel McCreary, One hundred and forty-third Pennsylvania, ought to be examined. It is said the latter surrendered. He did this at Chancellorsville, and in an unsatisfactory manner.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 18, 1864.

Suit yourself; select the most suitable place and wit will suit me.

rifle-pits, which indicates a new line. I am getting the troops in hand, and advancing my skirmishers rapidly. We find a skirmish line in front.
