REMARKS.- The foregoing gives the strength of the Army from two distinct sources. The difference in number results from the difference in dates at which the respective returns were made up before being sent to this office. The strength (790,197) obtained from the muster and pay rolls is considered the proper one, as it embraces many rolls of the muster for October 31, 1862. The difference (41,116) may well exist when it is considered that the troops now daily going into the field are of necessity not borne on the returns received from the various armies and army corps.
