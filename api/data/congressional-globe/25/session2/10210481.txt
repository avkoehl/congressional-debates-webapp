be mere promp'ly and liberally met than m the
State of Get rgu
Will the gentlemen from Rhode Island, whose
constituent' have petitioned this body to rescue the
Cherokee? from the cupidt y and avarice of Geor-
gia, and to mierpose and stay her oppressions to-
wards tnat tribe, permit me to say that it is ex-
ceedingly strange that such censures should be in-
flicted upon a State by those « ho, certainly, are ig-
norant of many of the facts' These unwelcome
allegations are too grave to let pass unnoticed, a
proper spirit would dictate to thoce petitioners the
moral atrocity of arraigning the character of a
whole people, without a knowledge of the facts
which would justify such unchantableneis
Is there no reason why Rhode Island should ex-
hibit a modest diffidence on this subject Let her
remember th  d stmy of that warlike and noble
tribe, the Katraganselts, which once proudly fa-
versfd the hills and plains around that beautifal
and capacious ba}, between poims Seconei and
Jucfitn, w hose canoes alone, for cemunes, floated on
it  otherw^e undisturbed wattr-, a tribe which was
thp terror of the whites Tell me not of the cruel-
tie  and oppressions of the Cherokess—of the pa-
triotism of their while chiefs Go and read the
tale of } our own Indian wars, the fate of noble Mi-
antommo, a chief of the Narragansett tribe, the
treacherj which produced hisdeath, and inquire who
abetted his destruction then tell me whether there
1^ more oe effrontery or decencv in forgetting these
things, and making a crusade into Georgia in
searcn of objects ovpr which you may sympathize
The religious lanatic is more an object o! pity
th?n natred, but the political agitator, who thus act 
f r m?re p rtj purpose or for individual notonetj,
desenes tV e<cera ions of mankml I censure
rot thp peop'p, un Vr the protectim of whose hu-
manity andchr stunpn lanfhrop) this distinguished
tribe hive disappeared, like tn  cloud o the morn-
ing, before the sun, that same kindness, under the
same circu nstanees, wou'd again produce the same
result. To preserve .he race from extermination,
you must plant them beytfnd the influence of tne
white man.
Look at Connecticut, yes, sir, that land of
"steady habits," the theatre of many pleasing asso-
ciations to me, she, too, has made sympa'hizmg re-
monstrances against the Cherokee 'reaty, alleging
fraud in the Go emment, and demanding of Con-
giess to stay Georgia in her course and in her In-
dian policy, and to prevent the p-n-p^tra' on of far-
ther outrages on the Indians The representatives
of that State, I trust, will not consider me unkind
in asking, "Where is tne last of the Mohegans?"
the early fr ends of the whi e man the bones cf
their ancestois—the buna -grounds of their ch efs
—wnere are they' Fertilizing the fie'ds of the town
of Norw ich—where once w as to oe seen the grave
of Úricas, the sachem, the honortd fr end and con-
fiding ady of jSTew England in her early dijs To
history I commit their memorj Already has "th"
last of the Mohegans," been eomm-morated in
story The annals ot no State m this Union are
moie strongly maiked with acts of harshness, op-
pression, and crueltv inwards 'he Ind ans than that
of Connecticut Perhaps rn?nv pnihatn.es for
thesp apparent barbin'ics are to be f unci in the
ferocious charatei of the savage, and their unie-

Mr Chairman, veie t,oü nit surprised when
you heard the i oice of New YorU Vt h), her
boldness amazed me She cried aloud and «pared
not—Georgia I speak of the petitions torwarded
to this House, and now on the Cleik's deik, they
speak of oppression, crueitj, and fraud Let me
turn the glass to her, and ask hei to see herse't as
others see her and to examine herself before she
complains of the improprieties ol others Does she
not perceive the great difference between precept
and example"!   It must not be considered illiberal

in me lo inquire after the Sénecas, ons of the con-
federated tribes of the Six Nations. Will the re-
presentative from Buffalo tell me in what part of
this Union that powsrfui confederacy no* existe?
What has been the destiny of that distinguished
chief Red Jacket? whose honor and honesty -were
untouched aad unsullied—now mouldering in
his grave, and nothing left of the tribe but
his portrait, now hanging m your Indian gal-
lery. It would be useless to trace the destiny
of the Tuscaroras, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas,
&e a few remain as miserable monuments of the
numerous tribes which, at one penod, were the
lords oí the Emp re State Then h mting-irounds
are now decorated with splendid cities, beautiful
towns, plentiful fields, a dense, thriving, and intel-
ligent population Ge and visit the u estera part
of that State—the inheritance of these tribes will
philanthropy sicken and weep over the change, or
mourn at the prosperity of our race1 Who will
sigh when he beholds the magnificent churches,
tpmples of the true God, erected on soil once the
he itage of a race that knew not cnnstianity?
The race has dwindled, but few remain—they are
frone—"thp places that knew them once shall know
hem no morp forever" Who occipies their
lands' and how was that occupancy obtained—by
treaty or contract' If so, to wnom was the conside-
ration pa'd? Not to the Indians, for they are po< r
and dependent And yet gentlemen fram lhat State
speak of the South, and especially Georgia, as be-
ing illiberal and inhuman, and insinuate, m lofty
iones, that we are violators of justice and human -
ty Is this kind' is it right? It i-, one of the dc-
\ ices of the wi rid to concpal our own impn pne-
ties bj diverting the attention to others, but i> is the
part of wisdom, and one of the obligations of duty,
to strive at 'east to know one's se' An observ-
ance of tnis precept wruid haie shielled Georgia
from the attacks or censures oflsew York Let
her remember the moral nf the "g'ass house "
I have,iron a disposition tj economise the time
of ihe comm ttee, passed without comment, the
legislation of severa1 of the Eastern States, con-
nected with their Indian re'ations Many were
fortunate and successful (¡rom the rige r of the r
enactments, and not, I presume, from their extreme
humanity and indulgence to the Indians) in being
relieved at an early period from stch troublesome
neighbors I sha!', (o1- the same reason, omit all
the Midd e States, not one of which, at this day,
has e n the lemnant of a tribe rema mng. Such
has been thp influence which their philanthropy and
humane legislation have had, that the numerous
tribes which once existe 1 among them -have va-
nished, disapi eared, and are now forgotten a beau-
tiful commentary on tne fceje.olencs of those
States and the practical operation of their humane
protection'
