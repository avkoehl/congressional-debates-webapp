secured that otject by his proposition to have an-
nual reports laid before Congress. In an ordinary
case, that Senator would °pura such a tardy and
inefficient mode of reaching his object. Sacb re-
port?, made only >early, and coming tardily before
Congress, would be too late to afford any remedy
expected fiom publici'y. Tiie true and only safe-
guard of publicity, i? to be found m the principie
of Uymg 'hp offering book open on ibe bank-
counter tor daily inspec ion. Any thing short of
this is but delusion.
The arguments on the other tide are now re-
duced to thic, that a National Bank is wanted to
give the country a sound and uniform currency.
Who has given the country the unsound currency
thus respiring regulation? Who out the Dank 1*
And no v it i, proposed to create an additional
Bank to lessen the evd originating m the <*ys.tem
H is to augment and support. If a Ban'? must be
made, let it be such a Bank as will givea cúrrele?,
ih¿ value of winch is in its* lf, and not to bea^cei-
tamed mereiy by coiapanson. Mere paper has no
value but hat given to it at pleasuie by 'ho^e who
issue i'as a representative ot value. Its value is
just whatever bank directors find it is their interest
to sav it is. To-dsy, it n?ay suit their speculations
to make it rf one vamp, and, to-morrow, of ano-
trer valu**. And this up aud down movement is
-to be cailed "giving a sound and uniform cmren-
cy." Toe Senator from Kentucay has-had much
experience in hie; but it is s>ngrj ar hi? experience
has not taught him that a National Bank is noc to
be trusted tor the object he avows Does he not
know from thp experience of the past, that when
the country is mo*t affected by a disorganized cur-
rency, banks aie leakt ab e to afford a^ststaace, be-
cause i* is the very time they themselves stand m
need of it. At such a time, when bank rhreerors
yield to tne warvs ot others, they augment the evi
and increase t"e difficulties by increasing the re-
spo&^ibdít es of their own institutions If *-ome
merchant of hitherto high star-ding aad extensive
business appeals to a bank dircC or, and his fee!-
ingsa-"e touched, he cannot resist the appeal, and
he mikes advances which he dare not make in the
face of publicity. Publicity would save the offi-
cers of such institutions from appeals of ¡his na-
ture. They would themselves be relieved from
temptation to do what they conscient'ously know
they ousht not to do. No man of doubtful credit
would apply to them if he knew hi  application
must be made public; and why should such appli-
cations b§ encouraged?
Mr. C said his strength failed from indisposi-
tion, and he "hontd defer to some other occasion,
m the progress of the bilí, such «rt^er remarks as
he wi hed to make.
THE   FISCAL   BANK.
DEBVTE IN THE SENATE,
On the bill t>   incorporate THE SUBSCRIBERS TO THfcFlS
U\L 1ÍANKOF1HB UNITED fefATBS
July 1, 1841
Mr  RVE^ moved to sti ike out a pait of the 16th article of
the 11 section oí the biit anil to insert the following
"ftijuihesail cor,) nation &hallestablish a competent office
of discount and deposite m any State, by the absent of the Le
gislamreof such S ate, whenever the directors may think fi so
to do, and when established, the office shall not be with

cootiaiy to law oi tht1 con> itu ion of the bank, or, instead oí
estah inning such oihees, it shall be lawful for the directois of
the said coipoiauon fiom tmae to tune to employ any mdivi
dual afffnt m any other bankoi banks to be appioved by the
hecielarv of the Tieasary, at any place oi places that they may
deem sate and proper, to nuna°eand uan&dct the busmen piu

to pel form the duties heieinafter uqunedol saidcorpm ition
to be managed and tiansacted by such omceis, u Hter «uch
agreement  and subject to suca regulations as they shall deem
mat and propei "
The amendment being read, Mr  RIVES remarked that the
Sena e would perceive it was m the preci-e woids of the pro
let submitted to the Senate some time since by the ^ecietnyof
theTieasuiy     It requned the assent of thp Legislatures o t the
States to the establish nent of branches oi ornees oí hscount and
deposite within their respective bmits   This principle hart been
pietei muted in the bill reported by the Senator from Kertucky,
(Mr  Clay,1 which expressly empowers the director" of the
corporation to establish offices of discount and deposite whet
ever they think  fit, without regard to the consent of the States
The object of the amendment is to restore the principle of the
Secretary's projet
Before ho proceeded to the consideration of the amendment,
however, Mr II said he beaded to pay a few words m regard
to the general question lnvolytd in the measure now before the
Senate Alt would agree that something must he done to put
an end to the present unsatisfactory and eminently irjunous
«tate of things The necessities of the Governmentand the dt,
langedand buffer ku condition of the counti y equally demand
it A fiscal ag nc> of some smt er other in ty he constituted
to conduct the vaned and important concerns of the riea&uty,
and at the same time to exeit asalu aiy andiestora'iveii flu
em e upon the general ennency of the country The teno Trea
sury system of the late Administration, it is now frankly admit
ted by many of its ajvo ates, has been decisively repudiated by
tne deliberate judgment ol th- nation, am!, in obedience to their
voice, a bill for it1! repeal has bten recently passed by a laige
majority of this hxly, which willdouhtle^ soon b come the
law ol the land What then, is tobe e-ubatituted? In fomter
petiods of oui hiatoiy, the employment of fo ate banks hal been
consideied as 'he tiue and legitimate alrernitive ofaBarkof
the United state In 1791, when the RtpabVan paity or that
day op{ used the e«rabli-,h*% entnf the first Bank of the Tfmfed
sta % -in 1 a^ain in IPlt when they lesnied and de'eaf d 'he

to the Sta'e banks as *"i ini«hmir the propei and suffnent means
for conducting the financial opera ion* oi the (t neial Ou
v trnment, without the nece-s ty of incorpoiatmg a national m
stitufion
Mi Kivcs said he had hin«eif prefe rei' that sy tern, and

of patriotism, wisdom, and practical statesmanship, worthy of

upon uncontested ground, to require no surrender of opinion
on the che side oi the oth r,as io the lights claimed or denied

simply to forbedt, on both sides, from entering on that litigated
d>raam ile pioposed, in short, to follow aa example which
has been so fruitful of peace in our international relations, in

vention of an express piopo*in>n to give to ( ongress the gene-
ral authouty to giant challéis oí mcoiporation for the Union—
the whole of this ancient fie d of controversy is prudently-
avoided by the Secre'aty'  plan Itin the disputed territory on
which oo entty is to he made, but, by (he conjoint exeicise of
admitted powers within the well defined and ascertained limita
on either fide of the contested boundaiy—of the power of Con-
"ipss "to exerci°e exclu ue legislation mall cases whatever"
withmti e Dnttict, and the power of the Slates to give their
a bent fo the establishment of hianohes of the pioposed msli

said, as a local Legislature foi the District, but emphatically as
Hhe Legislature of the Union " What is this magnificent Ca-
