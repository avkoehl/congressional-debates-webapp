to Major Goff and Lieutenant Chenoweth at Beverly, for the use of the troops under your command. Several hundred arms have also been sent, for the use of your command, to Colonel Jackson, at Harper's Ferry. Several companies have been directed to go with the arms from Staunton to Beverly, and to gather strength as they passed along. It is hoped that a considerable force has, by this means, been gathered together, which will be increased by the arrangements which you have made.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

R. E. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.

JOHN T. SEAWELL,

Esq., Gloucester Court-House, Va.:

SIR: Your letter of the 15th instant is in hand. The engineers who examined Your River considered Gloucester Point the lowest available position for a battery for the defense of the entrance of that river. It is difficult to procure men enough to man the battery already erected, and, by increasing posts, this difficulty would be enhanced.

Colonel Taliaferro has been previously directed to muse the troops from the county of King and Queen into the service of the State, and to form a regiment at Gloucester Point of the troops from the three counties of Gloucester, Matthews, and King and Queen. It is hoped that sufficient troops from those counties will be obtained for the defense of their homes.

Very respectfully, &c.,

R. E. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,Richmond, Va., May 19, 1861.

Colonel WILLIAM B. TALIAFERRO,

Commanding, &c., Gloucester Point, Va.:

COLONEL: Your letter of the 14th instant is in hand. I regret to learn that your force is so small, and request you to use every exertion to increase it. Under the authority of the governor, by his proclamation of the 3rd instant, you are authorized to extend your call for volunteers to the country of Matthews. It is hoped that you will collect troops enough from the counties of Gloucester, King and Queen, and Matthews to form at least a regiment, to which your force should be extended. It is not desired to take private houses, unless the exigencies of the service imperatively require it. A proper hut can be erected for a hospital. There are no military engineers available for laying off the rear defenses you desire, and it is hoped that the naval officers and others with you will be able to perform the duty. It is probable that the laboring force in the neighborhood will be sufficient to perform the work required on these lines of defense. Blank forms, &c., have been directed to be forwarded to you from the Quartermaster and Commissary Departments.

Very respectfully, &c.,

R. E. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.
