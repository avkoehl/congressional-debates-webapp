CITY POINT, VA., March 9, 1865-10.30 a.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington:

Persons friendly to the Union living in Richmond have sent out word that the rebel navy, liberated from duty in Charleston Harbor by the evacuation of Charleston, has been sent West for the purpose of depredating upon our river transportation. It is expected that they will operate most on the Ohio River, but it will be well for us to guard particularly against their operations on both the Ohio and Mississippi. Will you please put all commanders on the Ohio and the Mississippi on their guard against these men?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
