WARRENTON JUNCTION, August 27, 1862.

General BURNSIDE,

Falmouth, Va.:

A dispatch to me was lost by an orderly. If anything of much importance has been sent would like it repeated. I leave in the morning for Greenwich toa id in protecting the line of retreat, which is now threatened. Would that I were out of this; I don't like the concern. I think there is no cause for alarm here or anywhere, except for Washington. Communication should at once be opened from Alexandria. No effort to do so is being made from here. The reliance is upon Alexandria.

F. J. PORTER,

Major-General.
