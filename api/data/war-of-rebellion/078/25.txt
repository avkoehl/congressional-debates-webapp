Commanding Second Brigade:

COLONEL: You will detail daily from your command a vedette guard of nine men and one non-commissioned officer for each of the following roads: The Randolph, Old Raleigh, New Raleigh, Germantown, New State Line, Pigeon Roost, Hernando, and Horn Lake. These will be posted at a suitable distance in advance of the infantry pickets, and will be relieved each morning at 9 o'clock by others. You will also detail each day a commissioned officer to act as officer of the day, whose duty it shall be to see that these vedette posts are properly posted, and that they understand and properly perform their duties. He will report at these headquarters at least once each day. It is suggested that the same officer remain on this duty two days in succession, as it is difficult to make the entire rounds and properly instruct the guards in one day. The Provisional Regiment is now performing all this duty for the entire command.
