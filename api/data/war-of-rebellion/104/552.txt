Macon, May 1, 1865.

Division commanders are directed to take additional precaution to prevent marauding. The pickets must be strengthened, the vedette line doubled, patrols continually kept moving, and roll-calls ordered. Continual complaints from the citizens reach headquarters, and marauding must be stopped at once by resorting to the severest measures that division commanders may see fit to adopt.

By command of Brevet Major-General Wilson:

Davis.
