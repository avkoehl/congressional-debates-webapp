Brigadier General CHARLES CRUFT, Blue Springs:

General Baird was not disbursed yesterday. Harrison was driven in from Lee's farm to Lee and Gordon's Mills. The enemy has disappeared from our front. The last seen of him was by a scouting party sent out by Baird, who skirmished some with his rear guard, going in the direction of Gordon's Gap. Harrison has returned to Pea Vine Church.

Major General G. GRANGER:

Have you sent a brigade of infantry to Calhoun; if so, what brigade? It is necessary to know about this, that we may, if possible, draw Colonel Campbell in this direction, where his cavalry is much needed.

Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Five deserters just brought in confirm the report that Roddey passed through rome on his way to Dalton. They say the brigades of Roddey and Patterson came together from Alabama, and that all the troops in that quarter are ordered to Dalton.

I think the reports now in show that there are four cavalry brigades in the neighborhood of Dalton - Davidson's, Humes', Roddey's, and Patterson's. These deserters say the horses are in bad condition. The brigades which came from Alabama are two regiments each.

Respectfully,

JOHN M. PALMER,

Major-General.
