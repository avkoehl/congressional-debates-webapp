THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
333
TERRITORY OF WISCONSIN.
On motion by Mr. PATTON, and by unani-
mous consent, the House went into Committee
(Mr. SpriuiiT in the chair > on the bill from the
Senate to establish the territorial government of
Wisconsin.
Mr. MAY modified his former amendments,
so as to make the southern boundary of Wiscon-
sin conform to the boundary heretofore estab-
lished bv Congress between Michigan and Illi-
nois; which was agreed to.
Mr. PARKER moved to strike out that part
of the bill which granted to the Governor and
Legislature of the Territory of Wisconsin ten
thousand acres of land, for the purpose of defray-
ing the expense of erecting public buildings, with
a view to appropriating, in lieu thereof, a sum of
money for the purpose stated.
After ineffectual attempts to amend the section
proposed to be stricken out, and a few remarks
and suggestions bv Messrs. PARKER, HUNTS-
MAN': P. C. FULLER, SEVIER, VINTON,
PATTON, BOND, JONES of Michigan, HAR-
DIN, TURRILL, HAMER, and REED, the
motion of Mr. Parker to strike out was agreed
to, without a count.
Mr. HAMER moved to fill the blank thus
created with $30,000 for the purpose of erecting
public buildings: which was negatived.
Mr. GARLAND, of Louisiana, moved to fill
the blank with $25,000; negatived.
Mr. BROWN named $20;000, and Mr. GREN-
NELL ยง15,000.   The former sum was agreed to.
The committee then rose, and reported the bill
to the House as amended.
On motion by Mr. JONES, of Michigan, the
bill was made the special order of the day from
11 until 1 o'clock to-morrow.
On motion by Mr. CAMBRELENG, the House
proceeded to the consideration of the orders of
the day.
NAVAL SERVICE BILL.
The House then took up the bill making appro-
priations for the naval service of the United States
for the vear 1336, reported from the Committee
of the Whole with sundry amendments; which
were severally concurred in.
Mr. WHITE, of Florida, renewed the amend-
ment offered by him in the Committee of the
Whole, on the subject of the navy-yard at Pen-
sacola; and, after a few words in its support, he
asked for the yeas and nays thereon, which were
ordered.
Mr. CAMBRELENG opposed it on the ground
that it had not been referred to the regularstand-
ing committee, the Committee of Ways and
Means, which was the ordinary course.
Mr. SPEIGHT understood the gentleman from
Virginia [Mr. Wise] to state last night that the
substance of this amendment was reported in
another bill now before the Committee of the
Whole.
Mr. WISE repeated, in substance, his expla-
nation of last evening, that there was a bill em-
bracing the same objects; not in the same words,
"for building a wall," but for constructing a
hydraulic dock, which, of course, included a
wall. They were not separate objects, but be-
longed to each other.
Mr. SPEIGHT hoped, then, the gentleman
from Florida would withdraw his amendment..
Mr. JARVIS again explained that the items in
the amendment had not been made up from act-
ual surveys or statements, except one which
came from a captain in the Navy. The necessary
estimates had not been furnished to the Depart-
ment, nor was there a recommendation for them
from the Secretary of the Navy. The additional
bill embraced all that was necessary for the pres-
ent year.
Mr. PARKER recited the provisions of the
supplemental bill reported by the Committee on
Naval Affairs for removing the bar at Pensacola,
f 75,000, and for constructing a hydraulic dock,
or inclined plane, $125,000, objects entirely dif-
ferent from those contemplated by the amend-
ment of the gentleman from Florida. He also
quoted the letter of the Secretary of the Navy of
12th February last, and briefly supported the
amendment on the ground that the works con-
templated by it were as indispensable aa those
approved of. He thought, also, that the House
might act on the subject without waiting for the
recommendations of the Department.
Mr. GARLAND, of Louisiana,supported the
amendment. He remarked upon the extraordi-
nary circumstance that, though the Nnvy com-
missioners, some ten or twelve years ago, had
recommended this station, and that recommend-
ation was backed by the Secretary of the Navy,
yet the time had not yet arrived when gentlemen
would vote for appropriations to put it in a fit
condition. There were not less than ten or eleven
States interested in it; and it was the only site on
the whole Gulf frontier, the most dangerous of all
our sea-board, where a naval station could be con-
structed. It was also very remarkable that it was
never introduced into the regular appropriation
bills, but could only be reached in some supple-
mental bill, which might be lost, or in a Senate
bill, which might not be taken up.
Mr. RIPLEY also supported the amendment,
and gave a statement of the amount of commerce
on the Gulf of Mexico, both domestic and for-
eign, to show the importance of a naval station of
the first grade being constructed and kept up
there.
Mr. GARLAND, of Louisiana, sent the fol-
lowing letter from Commodore Dallas, to be read
from the Clerk's table:
I'sited Statfs Frigate Constellation,
Pensacola Bav, 16th February, 1836.
Dear Sir: You ask my views as to the necessity of a dry-
dock at Pensacola, and flatter me by supposing that an
opinion, expressed by me, would have weight in obtaining
an appropriation for that object. You are well aware of the
views I entertain in relation to this position as a naval
depot on the mosteitensive scale. Pensacola is, m my opin-
ion, the only point south of the capes of Virginia at which
any attempts should be made to that end. Other points
there certainly arc, where our commerce and the Navy
might find temporary relief from the stress of weather, or
from an eneim. Such positions no doubt could be found ;
indeed are already known, viz: the Tortugas, for vessels
of all classes, and Charleston, South Carolina, for sloops
of w<ir.
That a dry-dock ought to be constructed at this point is,
and has been my opinion, ever since i first became ac-
quainted with the harbor of Pensacola ; but in connection
with tins necessary' work to the refitment of vessels, the
bar at the entrance must not be neglected. A very trifling
expenditure of money, in comparison with the object to be
obtained, would, in my opinion, so enlarge and deepen it,
that vessels having the greatest draught of water could pass
at all times. I would also suggest that a hydraulic dock
be constructed at once, for the repairs of frigates and sloops
of war. This can be done and finished while the other
work is progressing. The materials for repairs are all at
hand, and of the best kind ; and when workmen shall be
required, they will be found without difficulty, provided
they be assured of constant employment.
Yours, very sincerely,                       A. J. DALLAS.
Mr. PEARCE, of Rhode Island, remarked,
that the question was whether what was asked
for was proper? The only valid objection that
had been urged last night was, that no more money
than was already appropriated could be expended
at Pensacola; but if it could not be expended this
year, it could the next. They should inquire
whether the proposed works were required; and
not only had no one urged an objection on that
score, but the best practical evidence had been
offered in their favor, by Commodore Dallas, by
the board of naval commissioners, by a former
Secretary of the Navy, and by the present. He
was in favor of the amendment, and if the amount
appropriated should not be expended in one year,
it could in two.
Mr. REED was disposed, as was the commit-
tee of which he was a member, to give as much
as was necessary to Pensacola; he, himself, even
to the amount of half a million; but he was
opposed to appropriating more than could be ex-
pended. Another objection was in the vagueness
of the amendment for " wharves and appendages;"
nor could he see how $150,000 was to be laid out
for wharves in one year. There waa no necessity
for acting upon it at this time, especially as the
Senate bill would come under consideration during
the present session.
Mr. JUDSON was opposed to the construction
of a hydraulic dock, for, by the operation of salt
i water upon timber in the South, it would be de-
stroyed in two, or at most, in three years. This
was a fact known to every merchant, and it would
therefore be utterly useless. He preferred the
propositions of the gentleman from Florida, and
should vote for them, because he believed them
reasonable, and because they were recommended
] I by men of the highest experience. He repudiated
the idea that the amendment should be rejected
'โข on the ground of there being another bill before
the House for the construction of an hydraulic
dork, when that dock, if constructed, would be
utterly useless after the first year or two. He
appealed to the good sense and justice of gentle-
men representing States where similar works had
been already constructed, to vote for the amend-
ment.
Mr. REED considered a hydraulic dock worth
more than ten wharves; and one of the au-
thorities referred to by the gentleman himself,
(Commodore Dallas,)recommended its immediate
construction. He could not assent to, nor he in-
duced to act upon, the gentleman's argument of
reciprocity. He was governed only by consider-
ations of propriety whether the proposed works
were expedient, and then, if the amount of money
proposed to be appropriated could be judiciously
expended.
Air. CAMBRELENG hoped the House would
at once come to a decision upon the question, and
that the amendment would not be prejudiced by
the fact of its non-examination by the Committee
of Ways and Means.
Mr. HARPER was willing to give a liberal
vote, but they were, he thought, to a certain ex-
tent, groping in the dark, for there was still a
difference of opinion existing as to whether the
amendment was embraced in a separate bill or
not. Moreover, nothing had been furnished the
House to show the necessity of the proposed
works, or whether the large sum of $150,000
could be well laid out or not. He should oppose
the amendment now, whatever he might be dis-
posed to do when the subject again came up, prior
to which, he trusted some more information would
be furnished.
Mr. CUSHING advocated a liberal provision
for Pensacola, and was in favor of the amend-
ment. Whether the money could be expended
or not, he was willing that it should be appro-
priated. When the bill from the Senate came
up, it would be time enough to enter upon this
subject of the expediency of constructing a hy-
draulic dock.
Mr. HARPER said, he found he had fallen
into an error, and that the other bill referred to
did not embrace the objects of the amendment.
Believing, then, that this money could be advan-
j, tageously expended, he should vote for the appro-
priation at the present time.
Mr. HOWELL expressed his intention of
voting against the amendment more with refer-
ence to the time, than from any other objection
to its expediency. He thought they had better
defer it.
Mr. JARVIS again made an explanation. The
Secretary of the Navy had recommended $64,000;
the committee inserted an additional $200,000;
and if the amendment now proposed should be
agreed to, they would appropriate to this one
navy-yard just one half the amount appropriated
for all the other navy-yards in the United States
put together.   He was willing to be as liberal as
any one towards Pensacola, even to the amount
/ of millions, if necessary, so that the money waa
judiciously expended; but he was confident the
|  committee had done all that ought to be done.
!  He was also opposed to that loose mode of legis-
lation of putting riders upon bills, or inserting
ยก, new  laws in  appropriation bills, and   he still
trusted the amendment would be rejected.    He
] was confident that no more money than what had
.! been proposed by the committee could  be ex-
;| pended  at Pensacola during the current year,
unless it was lavishly thrown away.
|    Mr.THOMPSON, of South Carolina, remarked
' that the appropriations would be j ust as necessary
! whether the experiment of deepening the bar
| succeeded or not, for our ships were not all sev-
!  enty-fours. He would mention one fact, however,
|, that was, perhaps, little, if at all known there,
; and it was this, that the bar at Pensacola was
ยก within one foot as deep as the bar at New York.
He would go further, and state, on the very
highest authority of our Navy, that the Brandy-
wine goes in and out of the bar without striking,
and that it was an extremely rare occurrence for
a vessel of a similar size to pass over the bar at
New York without doing so.   He maintained
