885
troop of cavalry, which formed part of the Mis-
sissippi squadron of dragoons at the siege of
New Orleans. On December 30,1814, in a charge
made by that squadron, he was shot through the
right shoulder, and badly disabled. From the
effects of this wound he has never recovered. At
that time, and for years afterwards, he was, pe-
cuniarily, in easy circumstances, and conse-
quently never applied for the pension to which
he was entitled. Recently reverses have over-
taken him, and he is reduced to poverty. The
disability incurred in his country's service ren-
ders him unable to labor, and ne is now com-
pelled to apply for an invalid pension, which he
asks may date from the time he received the
wound in 1814.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading, read the third time, and passed.

month.
Lieutenant Palmer served with distinction as
anoflicerof the ninth infantry.during the late war
with Mexico, and, while gallantly cheering on his
company at the storming of Cherubusco, was
desperately wounded in the head. The wound
compelled him to rcvsign his commission, after
being unable to report himself for duty for about
a year. He was pensioned on the 23d January,
3849, at the rate of seventeen dollars per month,
to commence on the 27th August, 1848, and -this
amount he continued to receive until the year
3855, when, finding it inadequate to his support,
and believing himself sufficiently recovered to dis-
charge a soldier's duty, he accepted a commission
as first lieutenant in ftis former regiment, and his
pension ceased. He held this commission but
a few months, when the nature and condition of
las wound compelled him to again resign. Upon
the occasion of his resignation, his brother offi-
cers, without exception, signed a complimentary
letter, expressive of their regret for the necessity
ofhis resignation, and their esteem and friendship
for him as an officer and a gentleman.
His pension, of seventeen dollars per month,
which ceased when he accepted his second com- i
mission, commences again, under the general j
statutes, from the date of his resignation, but it j
cannot be increased without special legislation in ,
Ins Lehalf.

JOIIN GUEST AND OTHERS.
The bill reported by the Committee on Naval
Affairs, (S. No. 211,) making a reappropriation
from the surplus fund for the relief of Lieuten-
ant John Guest, of the United States Navy,and
others, was read thesecond time, and considered
as in Committee of the Whole.
It provides that the sum of $1,760 49, being
the balance remaining of the appropriations
made by Congress in the years 1840 and 1841,
for the survey of the coast from Appalachicola
bay to the mouth of the Mississippi river, for
the ascertainment of the practicability of estab-
lishing a navy-yard and naval station which
should best subserve the protection of the com- ;
merce of the Gulf of Mexico, which balance lias
been carried to the credit of the surplus fund,
shall be reappropriatcd for the payment of the
sum due Lieutenant John Guest, United States
Navy, ($617,) for servic.es rendered in that sur-
vey, and for other lawful claims of officers who
were employed in it.
The proofs in this case show that the memo-
rialist, then a passed midshipman in the United
States Navy, performed service in that grade on
board of the United States steamer Poinsett, on
the survey of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico,
from Appalachicola bay to the Mississippi river,
from August 10,1843, to April 26,1845, one year
and eight months. Naval officers, engaged on
the coast survey, received extra pay by order of
the Secretary of the Treasury; and Lieutenant
Semmes, commanding the Poinsett at the time
mentioned, received extra pay by authority of
Congress, and this would have been paid had not
the appropriation been exhausted out of which
it is payable.

act of Congress, approved August29, 1842, which
granted him six dollars per month during his
natural life, to commence on January 1, 1840.

moor prison. The a^t does not specify the grade

disability. By a memorandum on hie, itappoars

ceeding $14,000.
Mr. HUNTER. I should like to hear some
explanation of this bill.
Mr. HAMLIN. There is a report in the case,
but, perhaps, I can explain it in a shorter time
than would be occupied in the reading of the
report. By a law passed in 1813, persons who
captured a British armed vessel were entitled to
one half of the proceeds. These persons seized a
British armed vessel in the Penobscot river, and
burnt it. They were, therefore, entitled to a
compensation at the time, but it has never been
paid to them. The Secretary of the Treasury
would pay it this day if there were an appropri-
ation, for the law is very clear; that is one pro-
vision.
The next proposition is to pay these parties
§1,400 for taking fourteen British officers and
sailors as prisoners of war. A law was passed
in 1814, providing that all privateersmen who
should take sailors or officers should be entitled
to a bounty of §100. This bill provides for
putting these persons who were landsmen on the
same footing which they would have occupied if
they had been privateermen. The statute-books-
are full of such cases. In all instances, I believe,
where prisoners of war were token by landsmen,
and they applied, they were put on the same foot-
ing as privatecrsmen.
