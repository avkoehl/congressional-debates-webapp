68                                        THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                      December 28,
entire, without bias or sophistication, would pro-
nounce upon the transitions disclosed in them.
It was sufficient that they were the sort of in
formation which evciy citizen of a Republic was
bound to obtain, if possible, and to digest and
pronounce upon accoiding to the dictates of his
unbiased intelligence and integrity Let it be re-
membered, too, that these documents could not
or would not be published whole and pel feet by
any newspaper picas They would be assorted,
selected, and confused The genuineness of some
would be denied, the foice of others would be
disguised, they would be lobbed of their genuine
power over the nund by being brought in, in de-
tached and impel feet poi lions, as aids to an ar-
gument in suppoit of some particulai view All
the benefit of the mutu\l cxp anitions they afford,
of the interpietation of out papei 01 tiansaction
by another m the same senes, would be lost to
the public, and the speech or the essay would
embody only such as might be made subservient
to its paitieulard sign He trusted there was
no poition of this House that would avow a de
sue to withhold (rom the people such impoitant
proofs of facts, until they could be made to pass
through themt nstiuumof such pioctssesas these,
and he thcicfoie hoptd that the objection to the
punting would not be further pressed
¡Mi WioL said h( should have thought no ob
jecuon would have been made by any member of
the Administration pally to the punting of a doc-
ument whuh had the n une and authoiitv of the
Dtpaumi ntiistlf f i the lnfoinmtion it contained
The g( ntlem in tiom Mi< I114 in [Mi Gruu] said
we should thiow oul falsi  lnloimatnn if false,
it was the handiwork of the Sicit taiy himself
But suppose that soint individuals had since
settled their accounts did that altei the fact' Or
could it be said that false information wasspiead
abroad, when the document itself would show
that tht beuetarv himself bad onnived at the
defalcations> If the documents had emana  d
from thi mimbeis of the Whig pauy—the 1 cd-
eral Bankitcs,as tht y uric called—hi should have
expeited that opposition would have been made,

Mr BOON siid it wis a littl smgulu that no
sul jeet louhl be mtioduetd into this Housed ith
ou 1 most violent attack being nmdi on the Ad
mimstiatint Hi undeistood that tin do ument
which gfiitlomen weie now desirous to h ive ic
published, had been published heietofore and
thiow 11 out to the country
Mi WIS! was understood to say that it had
oniy bten pimud for the membeis, not foi the
s ><   ml nut 1 in ttion of the people
Mi BOON said it was enough that it had gone
to the people through their Representatives on
tais Í1 ui Whet piopoition would twenty 01
fifty thousand copies bear to the aggregate amount
of the deal people of this country, foi whom cer
tun persons in this Hall professed so tendera
ierird for particular purposes' Here was to be
another item of cxtiavagance s tdown He was
one of the fiiends of the Administration, and he
was not afraid that any and everything should go
to the people whom he had the honor to repre-
sent, they had heard the tiuth before now But
he was not prepared to go for such a wasteful
expenditure of the public money as was here pro
posed
Mr CRARY repeated that one of the docu-
ments would not furnish correct information to
the people It was known that some persons had
there been put down as defaulters who, at the
time, had voeichers in their hands more than cov-
ering the amount charged against them Many
of them had since been settling up fiom quaiter
to quarter The document, therefore, did not set
forth the facts In older to give correct inform-
ation , it would be necessary to call on the Depart-
ment to know who had settled their accounts, and
what was the actual condition of the accounts of
individuals at the piesent time As to being
afraid to send forth documents to the people, he
had no fear of the kind He cared not how many
documents were printed, if their publication was
needed His constituents did not ask of him to
fm nish them with stale and gone by information
They wanted information of things as they ex
isted at the piesent time
He had been charged with wearing the party
collai of 18áG     Notwithstanding the charge, he
would be found as ready as the gentleman fiom
Vnginia to vote for the impeachment of any ofh
cer of the Government, on being satisfied of his
guilt     Let the gentleman produce his evidence,
and not be continually ciying " peculation, pecu
lation'"   1 ht House had long agohcaidenough
of this ei y    They ought now to be furnished with I
the evidence to suppoit it, if theie was any in ex-
istence    He had no doubt there weie peculators,
we have always had them   but they weie not more
guilty of a dereliction of duty than would be the
majority of the House, if they voted for the mo-
tion before them
Mi THOMPSON said that, since he had held
a seat on this floor, he never befoie remembered
an matinee 111 which the piominent men of the
party had ltfustd to punt the largest number of
a document, not < manatmg from the Opposition,
but from the paity themselves, and a IXputment
of tin Government l'he Opposition hid long
stood in this position, thnt the only he;ht which
the v could get was dragged foi th, extorted fiom the
public funetionauts of the country All we want
is light If evei the pnyerof A]ix—" Give us,
gnat God, but light"—wercapplicibleto the eon
dmon of any paity, it is so heie in roferenee to
the Opposition biif us light, and victory and
tiiumph await that paity
What is the objection made to this document'
It is, that it is stall    Piobably H may be so, piob- I
ably it is obsolete, piobably peculation will now
be acknowhdgid to be, is it is 111 tiuth, the order I
of the day  and honor and integrity are obsolete
If thev an not obsolete, theie an facts contained 1
in  this  document which never can become so
Ihuci^onc single fact in that document t1 e pub-
lication of which, looking to it e\c 11 m a pecuniary
point of imv, is woith hundieds and thousands
of doll us     What is it'    It is that on which so
much stiess has been laid by the gentleman fiom
Mississippi, [Mi   Piuvuss,] and pioiotisly by
the gentil man fiom Vnginui, [Mr  Wki,] that, j
whilst youi  Piosidtnt now with alacrity lushes
not only upon Swaitwout, but upon his secun
tit s, by a summary piocess, almost, if not qui e,
in vit lation of the Constitution, the Secictuy of
the Iiiasmy Ins, in anotlui mstince, ptrnutted
the Hw to slumber fiom day to day, and fiom

gross pecuh ton"*—not pt filiations «imply  thit is

But theie aie collate! il enormities in all these
acts The actwlmh the Picident savs deserves
nothing less h m the ignominious punishment of
a felon is not oniy connive 1 at, but a premium
ofiered foi it Heie is a man vv nom the Sccietny
has been supplicating, not dismissing with the
prompt indignation which ought to have followed
such proceedings, but supplicating fiom day to
day to give up the money which he had taken,
and yet this ve-y man was reappointed aftei the
peipetiation of íepeated acts which the Piesident
now says ought to be made felony Let the peo-
ple have the facts The people of this counfiy
aie honest at the core Give them light, let them
see that their functional íes have dono thus and
thus, and my life upon the result
But this document is stale When did it be-
come stile ' It never can be stale until coirup-
tion prevails all over the land Here are men
convicted of friuds, who are not only tolerated,
but aie reappointed to office I say in sineeiity,
that I believe, if the people will suomit to acts
of this kind, they are no longer capable of self-
government They are no longer fit to be free,
for they are no longer honest The gentleman
says there are excusatory facts I only speak of
facts as they are here presented But suppose it
should turn out that these men are not defaulters
what does that matter' The Government ¡ftottg/it
that they were so, when they trusted them again
lhey thought they were speculators, and reap-
pointed and continued them, that they had been
guilty of offenses woithy the ignominious pun-
ishment of a felon, and yet they were reappoint-
ed Still, if there are excusatory facts, let gen-
tlemen bring them out, 1 will go for the publica
tion of an equal number of all such documents,
and I will send one of them to each man to whom
I may transmit one containing the damning facts
set forth in this present document
Mr CAMBRELENG said that the gentleman
from South Carolina [Mr Thompson] seemed to
take it foi granted that the friends of the Admm-
ístiation were all opposed to the printing of the
documents
Mr THOMPSON gave some sign of dissent.
Mr CAMBRELENG said, the gentleman
said so
Mr THOMPSON said his remarks must have
been misundeistood, as he certainly had not made
that assemon What he had said was, that this
was the first instance, within his experience, in
which the proinmentmembers of an Administra-
tion paity had refused to punt a public docu-
ment lie did not know, and could not know,
that all the members of tl at pirty would vote to
refuse He supposed, on the contiary, that they
might divide, as on other occasions
Mi CAMBRELENG wasglad the gentlemm
qualified his remark I concur with the gentle-
man fiom Vngima [Mr Wisr] in the necessity
of publishing an extia numbei of these docu-
ments not, however, m the necessity of publish
ing them all, because I hope that, before one of
the documents is punted it will be refened to 1
committee, to examine and see what pans ne
uquisite for publication, and that we snail not do
as we did two yeais ago, publish a libel upon
dead men—men who have pioduced then vouch-
ers, and sett cd then accounts
Mi   WISE   Who wis the author of that hi il'
Mr CAMBR1LENG I concur in the opinion
tint that document nevershould have come from
the Department w thoutexplanatory documents
Mr WISE The Secietaiy was the luthorof
that libel, if a libel it was
Mi CAMBRELENG The document «as
furnished 111 obedience to a resolution—was spc
cially called for But the other document conta ns
mfoimation of an entirely nominal charactei
One half the individuals theie implicated aredetd
men, andotheis h ve brought their vouchers md
vet we hue been publishing the document annu-
ally If the Secretary did publish it, it was under
an ancient act of Congress, requiring the annual
publication Nominal de aulters should not be
punished as actual defaulteis Allow me here to
say to those gentlemen who seem so st nsit ve
about the case of Mr Swaitwout, that the public
mav imagine that they mean, by raising up the
ghosts of dead men foi foity years past, to cover
tq) the last hi id of one of their own friends I
will say that I commiserate, as much as any man,
theciseofMr Swartwout 1 ascribe his case,
as I do all such, to that favorite credit system of
thens, which, in othei woids, is the gambling
system Ihisit, the souiceof all the degiadation
in morals and character which we now witness
To this system, I say, gentlemen may tuce all
these evils But I shall not now go into that
question
Mi WISL desired to correct the gentleman
from New "iork m one fact The gentleman
speaks, and I understand the whole secret of it,
with a view to thiow the Opposition party in this
