SHARPE,

Colonel.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 2, 1865-9.30 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The enemy has abandoned Humphreys's front. I am pushing Humphreys' troops up the Boydton plank road and Claiborne road to try to connect on the right and left. Miles has returned here. If we hear firing on left from Sheridan, I shall attack there with Humphreys' corps. The enemy is moving apparently to his right and may be confronting Sheridan.

GEO. G. MEADE.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,April 2, 1865-9.30 a.m.

General WEBB or

Colonel RUGGLES,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

Direct General Macy to come here with what cavalry he can collect. Enemy has abandoned his line in Humphreys' front. Our troops are moving out on Boydton and Claiborne roads.

Communicate this to Ord, Wright, and Parke.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 2, 1865-10.30 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Humphreys reports Miles moving up the Cox road, and the enemy flying before him. The Fifth, I understand, is following Miles. I have sent an officer to Sheridan suggesting his force should move by the Cox and River roads and if he pushes the cavalry rapidly he ought to cut some of them off if they are going across the Appomattox as I suppose. I have ordered up the pontoon train in Wright's rear. Humphreys has reassumed the command of Miles. Fifth Corps left with Sheridan till your orders return it.

GEO. G. MEADE.
