The medal of honor is of bronze, of neat device, and is highly prized by those on whom it has been bestowed. Hitherto no medals have been conferred upon commissioned officers, apparently under the idea that at some future day their acts of distinguished bravery would be recognized by brevets. It is believed that in the majority of vases the award of a gold or a silver medal would be quite as acceptable as the brevet and of more substantial value, especially in the volunteer-service. Under the act of March 3, 1863, brevet rank carries with it no increase of pay or allowances in the volunteer service, and at the expiration of the term of the officer the brevet will, of course, cease with his other rank. If an act were passed to authorize it, a prompt and gratifying acknowledgment of distinguished services could be made by publishing a general order awarding to the officer "the gold medal" or the 'silver medal," with the privilege of engraving the on the name and date of the battle in which his gallantry was conspicuous. In case of his again winning distinction, he would be authorized in general orders to add to the inscription upon his medal the name and date of his new exploit. If both gold and silver medals were authorized, there would be no objection to the same officer being the recipient of both if won by meritorious conduct at different times and different in degree. The system of medals need in nowise interfere with the conferring of brevet rank in cases where such rank might be actually exercised in high commands or at the discretion of the President, but it would relieve the pressure for brevets on the part of the many officers who justly believe they have won a title to some mark of honor and would avoid the many vexed questions likely to arise from the possession of brevet rank by so large a number of officers as can reasonably prefer a claim to reward.
