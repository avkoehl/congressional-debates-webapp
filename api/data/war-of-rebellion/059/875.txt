CONFEDERATE CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. ROSS' Brigadier, JACKSON'S CAL. DIV.,

Numbers 4. Benton, Miss., March 1, 1864.

I. For conspicuous gallantry in the engagement with the enemy at Moscow, Tenn., December 3, 1863, and on other occasions, Private Henry Brocke, Company E, First Regiment Texas Cavalry, is hereby promoted to be fifth sergeant in his company.

II. For gallant and conspicuous conduct in the affair with the enemy near Benton, Miss., February 28, 1864, Private Henry King, Company E, Third Regiment Texas Cavalry, is promoted to fifth sergeant in his company.

III. Private John Derritt, Company A, Sixth Regiment Texas Cavalry, for his courage and daring, deserves the thanks of his officers. Although but a boy in years, he has proven himself a man in gallant deeds. Doubtless there are many others in the command eminently entitled to similar notices, but as their names had not been made known to the brigadier-genera he can only thank them in general terms. His gratitude is due and hereby acknowledged to the gallant men and officers of his command, who are ever prompt in the discharge of duty, brave and courageous in battle, and firm and unflinching amid the privations and sufferings to which we are all subjected during this period of our country's peril.

By order of Brigadier-General Ross:

D. R. GURLEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
