regiment nearly ready to start. You can rest at ease with regard to rations for my brigade as long as it remains here. I have a fine drove of cattle, with wheat enough in the valley for a month's bread, and crackers on hand for a march.

Captain Muhleman mentioned last evening that Peck would bring a rope needed for crossing the Tennessee River. Can you give me further information about it, and, if possible, order it over to me.

Colonel Suman has spoken to me of his conversation with you about transferring out of this brigade. I am of the opinion that it will be better that the transfer be effected. I have received a note from Colonel Foy, expressing his old desire to be in this brigade. I would say to him at once to come on, but I prefer to have the Sixth Ohio, if there are no objections upon your part and that of Colonel Grose. It will be a more even swamp, besides many other reasons for the preference. Colonel Anderson, with nearly all the officers of the regiment, has expressed his wishes in the matter in person. I would be under many obligations to you if my desires in this particular can be gratified. If not, I can make no objections to the arrangement with Colonel Foy.,

I have made a strong demonstration this morning in the direction of Harrison's Landing. I will do my part to my best ability. Can you send by the orderly any papers later than Nashville dates of the 27th ultimo?

I am, very truly,

W. B. HAZEN,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel PAYNE,

One hundred and twenty-fourth Ohio Volunteers:

Move your detachment, including artillery, to Soddy post-office and remain there till joined by Colonel Funkhouser. Information has just been received that the rebels intend making a raid this evening from about Thatcher's on the mills we are using. I will send out your remaining four companies, with other infantry, with Colonel Funkhouser, who will command the expedition.

Respectfully,

W. B. HAZEN,

Colonel WILEY,

Forty-first Ohio Volunteers:

Return with your detachment with as little delay as practicable, as I wish to send troops in the opposite direction.

Respectfully,

W. B. HAZEN,

Brigadier-General.
