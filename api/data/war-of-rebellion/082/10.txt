General A. A. HUMPHREYS:

I forward you this communication, just received:

HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS.

General WARREN:

Private F. Buckhatter, Sixteenth Mississippi, Harris' brigade, Anderson's division, Hill's corps, came in this evening and delivered himself up. He states that Anderson's division relieved Wilcox's division in our front, and that Wilcox moved farther to their right on the evening of July 3; that the advanced battery in our front near the plank road has places for six guns; that a four-gun battery, Napoleons, of the Washington Artillery, are in the work, and Harris' brigade supports it. General Wright's brigade, of same division, joins Harris' on his left; says this brigade is extreme left of Hill's corps, and believes it connects with Beauregard's troops. There is a rumor among their men that all General Lee asks of them is to hold their position; they have orders not to fire on our men unless we open on them or advance. This General Anderson is now in temporary command of Longstreet's corps. General Longstreet is still confined by his wound at Lynchburg. The prevailing feeling among their men is that Grant will not take Richmond, nor even Petersburg, that they can hold them both. General Mahone is in temporary command of Anderson's division.

S. W. CRAWFORD.

Brigadier-General.

G. K. WARREN.

Major-General, Commanding.
