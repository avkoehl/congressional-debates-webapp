Colonel T. J. HAINES,

Chief Commissary, Saint Louis, Mo.:

The general says railroad men report Boeuf Creek bridge will probably be all right in three days. It will be a great saving of time to send stores then to Hermann. Until then select the lightest boats for up-river transportation.

JOHN V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

HERMANN, MO., October 13, 1864 - 9 p. m.

Colonel F. D. CALLENDER,

Chief of Ordnance, Saint Louis;

We suppose you have plenty of ammunition for our artillery. If not, get it as soon as possible. Report.

JOHN V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

SAINT LOUIS, October 13, 1864 - 8.30 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Hermann, Mo.:

Brigadier-General Douglass telegraphs from Mexico for re-enforcements. Shall I send them, and if so, how many? I can manage, I guess, to send whatever your order, except cavalry. He telegraphs that he has 400 men, but no defenses of any kind. Captain Eno has ordered him to intrench and fortify. There are two considerable bridges adjacent to Mexico, which are the only bridges on that road, except near Saint Charles. May not the road be of importance to you as the line of supply and communication for your army, when you push Price beyond the La Mine? The Government freight on Hannibal and Saint Joseph and North Missouri Railroads is being rapidly pushed through from Macon, and no more for the present will be shipped from here. The rolling-stock of both roads is being collected at Saint Charles, Hannibal, and Saint Joseph.

THOMAS EWING, JR,

Brigadier-General.

HERMAN, MO., October 13, 1864 - 9 p. m.

Brigadier General THOMAS EWING,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

Four companies of the Fourteenth Iowa Volunteers ordered from Rolla to Saint Louis. Refit them as soon as possible and use them as escort for ammunition.

JOHN V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

HERMANN, MO., October 13, 1864.
