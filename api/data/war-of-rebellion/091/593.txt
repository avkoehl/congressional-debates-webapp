NEWTOWN, November 10, 1864 - 9 a. m.

(Received 7 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I have started a brigade of infantry this morning from Winchester to protect the railroad working parties. I sent a brigade of cavalry there some days since. I have had a small division of cavalry operating on the east side of the mountains, in the vicinity of Upperville, Paris, Bloomfield, and surrounding country. No enemy found there, nor had anything been in that section excepting Mosby's command. A lot of stock horses, sheep, and cattle were brought in by this force, and the grain, barns, subsistence, &amp; c., far as practicable, were destroyed. Any reports that you may have heard or received within the last few days of large raiding parties of the enemy, and of a concentration of Mosby near Berryville, are untrue.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

It is not the Secretary's intention that General Seward shall be permanently relieved from command at Martinsburg, but he wishes an officer assigned to relieve him until he returns from leave. Acknowledge receipt.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
