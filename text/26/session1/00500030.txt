sisted that the Chair should order the gentleman
either to take his .seat or go on.
Mr. DUNCAN Mill continuing on the floor,
Mr. PROFF1T rose and said a few words that
were jot hcarJ.
Sereral gentlemen called Mr. Proffit to order;
when
The CHAIR asked if the gentleman from Ohio
yiyVied the floor.
/Mr. DUNCAN replied in the negative; and se-
1 /eral gentlemen requesting Mr. D. to proceed in
\ A\ls remarks, he commenced with a few remarks
i/which vere not heard. He knew, he said, the
principles he was acting en, and knew (hat they
were in accordance with those entertained by the
peopleof the United State?. He knew he was main-
tv.ining the principles here which depended for
their preservaron on the purity of the elective
franchise, and he eared not whether this was as-
saulted by management or stratagem; he was
equallj bound to defend it. This question must,
he said, bs discussed, and it mattered not whether
it was discussed now or hereatter; i's merits must
be gone into, and nil the efforts ef the Opposition to
prevent it would be fruitless and unavailing.
What was the history of this matter? It was well
known to every gentleman here, and the know-
ledge of the fact was so general that it was almost
useless to repeat it; but, as other gentlemen had
done it, he would do it from the same motive; and
that was, for home consumption.
Mr. D. then went on to detail the proceedings of
the Clerk in calling the House to order, and call-
ing over the roil until he  was  arrested by coming
to the members from New Jersey,   which he said
was in conformity with uv.ge, wiih Jaw, and with
the obligations imposed on him  by  the sanctity of
an oath.    He himself, Mr. D. said, had inter-
rupted the Clerk when, in calling the roll,he came
to the State of New jersey, but perhaps in too
low a voice to be heard; and he had determined
beforehand    not    to   let    the    gentlemen   who
came  here without   having   a   majority  of  the
popular  vote, be   called.     Whether the   Clerk
was  solely   interrupted   by    his  objections,   0r
from  any  other cause,  he  did  not know; but
this he did know, that the Clerk did not pursue the
course because required of him by the Democratic
party. Did the Clerk do right, or did he do wrong?
II he was right, then all the censures for waste of the
public time ar-,d the public money, must rest upon
those who opposed   his proceeding with the call
of the  roll, because he submitted the decision in
the case of the New Jersey members to the House
itself.   If he was wrong, then let all these censures
rest on those who have supported him in the course
he has taken.   Mr. D said the Clerk was risht.
He was bound by the very nature of his duty, and
by the oa'h he had taken, to act as he had done.
What was his duly?   He was bound by his duty
to enrol the names of the members of the Twen-
ty-sixth Consrtss.    He had evidence, conclusive
to his mind, lhat John  B. Aycrigg, John P. B.
Maxwell,    William    Halsted,   Charles   C.
Siratton, and Thomas J. Yorke, were not elected
members of the Twenty-sixth Congress.   He had
evidrnee of that fact in his possession, and what
would be his situation, Mr. D. a.-ked, had  he en-
r< Sled their names, and called them as member.' of
thu Conaress?   Sir, (^aid Mr. D.) he would be
looked   upon   by   the   moral  intelligence of the
country,   as    having    violated    the   obligations
of   duty,   and   tie   sanctity   of   an   oath.    He
had   evidence   that   t'nry  were   not   members o!
the Twe..ty-Mtth Consress, and he mbmitted the
question involved to the House, fiisrgesung a post-
ponement of ihp case of the New Jersey members
unt'l the rest of the roll should be called overatul a
quorum a-c<-rtained.     It had been coitend-'d stre-
nuouslj ib.it thesp five gentlemen pcs^fs-eJ, as evi-
dence f their p'<p'i< n, the eertifip-te  of the  Go-
vtr.ior of Nc w J> rsry, wrh the "broad seal" of the
Stat , and tha' ti .- whs the c 'y evidence he  ws<
entitled 10 receive.      The   whole  argument, from
that ti-ne io rhi«, pnts Mm in mmrl of a bule book
he haired on  logic, and frrro  which  he would
cite a   few examples:   "Gentlemen  wear   boots;
A   B   wears   boots;   therefore  A   B is a gen-
tleman."     "Ladies    wear   carsets;   Miss    A
wears corsets; therefore Miss A is a lady.
The fact, according to this logic, that A B wears
boo's, is primo facie evidence that he isa gentleman;
and the tact that Miss A wears corsets, is prima
facie evidence lhat she is a lady. And yet, said
Mr. D. I have known many men to wear boot<
who are not gentlemen, and many women and
girls to «car corsets who are not ladies. (Much
laughter) The wearing of boots and corsets is
so genero!, that it no longer furnishis evidence of
the wearers- being gentlemen and ladies. £o also
with members of Congress. The cercfiea'e an J
"broad seal" is so common to members ot Con-
gress, that it is no longer priutr facie evidence ot
membership. He knew pretended members of
Congress who bear the ctrtlfirates and broad sea's,
«ho are not members and it was getting so com-
mon, that the fact ol their having such was not
prima fade evidence of their membership. We have
heard much (said Mr. D.) about this "broad sea',1'
and he did not know that it was worth while to
say much about it; he hid. heard it mentioned at
least one thousand times in the rourse of thi« de-
bate. It seemed that it wa-- a very broad seal
indeed. One gentleman held that it was not i he
trac'r of a cal i's foot, but of an ox's foot. Ashe
remarked last evening, it must be as broad as the
foot of Milton's devil when he was cast out of Pa-
radise, which co'vered ten acres. At least it was
Iroad enough to cover two townships in New Jer-
sey and neutralize the Democratic votes of a whole
State. Now he wanted to know what there was in
reality about this seal to give ii so much impor-
tance. He supposed it derived its solemnity ai'd
consideration from its antiquity. If so, it must he
remembered that it had its orisiu in the days of
ignorance, when men conld neither read nor write.
In Eng'and,it had been the fate of the broad seal, to
which gentlemen attached so much importance, to
be cast into the Thames, where it now lies. King
James II threw it into the river, thinking that by
the loss of the "great seal," he could get rid of some
obligations imposed on him. According to the
doctrines of gentlemen, therefore, if they want to
hunt for the great seal of England, they must go to
the bottom of the Thames for it.
Now he had stated that the Clews had the most
conclusive evidence in his possession, lhat the
names he hid read were not members of Ihe
Twenty-sixth Congress, and therefore, he was so-
lemnly bound by his duty, not to enrol tbem as
members of the Twenty-sixth Congress. He
asked, therefore, the reading of lhat evidence.
The Clerk then read the following documents,
which had been filed in his office:
The following is the certificate of the Secretary
of State of New Jersey, showing the returns of
election on record in his office:

I, James D. Westcott, Secretary of Sta'eofNew
