WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., June 12, 1862.

Major-General FREMONT:

Accounts which we do not credit represent that Jackson is largely re-enforced and is turning upon you. Stand well on your guard; get your forces well in hand, and keep us well and frequently advised, and if you find yourself really pressed by a superior force of the enemy, fall back cautiously toward or to Winchester, accoding to circumstaces, and we will in due time have General Banks in position to sustain you. Do not fall back of Harrisonburg unless upon tolerable clear necessity. We understand Jackson is on the other side of the Shenandoah from you, and hence cannot in any event press you into any necessity of a precipitate withdrawal.

A. LINCOLN.

P. S.-Yours prefering Mount Jackson to Harrisonburg is just received. On this point use your discetion, remembering that our object is to give such protection as you can to Western Virginia. Many thatnks to yourself, officers, and men for the gallant battle of last Sunday.

A. L.
