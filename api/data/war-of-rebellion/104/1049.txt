Major General G. H. THOMAS,

Commanding, &c., Nashville, Tenn.:

No changes in the troops now in Alabama and Mississippi will be made until further advised by you. I have turned over the Thirteenth Corps and nearly all of the cavalry of my command to General Sheridan. Of the white troops in Alabama and Mississippi only 7,000 are veterans.

I shall need some of the cavalry now in the Department of Mississippi if it can be replaced by you.
