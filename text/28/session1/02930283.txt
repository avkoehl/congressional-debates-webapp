APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

28th Cong 1st Sess.
Tariff and Distribution—Mr. Ji. Stewart.
H. of Reps.
of nails from twelve to three cents per pound,
the duty is increased to 100 per cent.; this is equal-
ly true of spikes, rods, wood screws, &c. Again:
eight cents a yard duty was imposed on coarse cot-
tons when imported at 20 cents, being a duty of 40
per cent., but now, when the price has come down
to five, cents per yard, the duty goes up to 160 per
cent.
Sir, I could go on and enumerate more than twenty
such instances where the duties, though moderate
when imposed, now actually exceed the price of the
article; yet we are told that in all cases the duty is
added to the price, and paid by the consumer! That
is, that the consumer pays $4 a box duty on glass
that he buys for $2; 4 cents a pound on nails that
he buys for 3; and 8 cents a yard on coarse cotton
goods that he buys for 5. Such are the absurdities
into whiffh these stale anti-tariff theories involve
their votaries; but suppose what they allegp were
true in point of fact, and that the duty is really ad-
ded to the price, the cost of cotton goods being 20
cents when the duty of 8 cents was imposed: add
the duty, the price would be, of course, 28 cents a
yard, and the duty only 28 per cent, instead of 160,
as stated by the committee; hence, if you raise the
price five-fold, then the duty is quite reasonable,and
there will be no objection whatever to its payment.
Let the manufacturer, then, run up his price from 5
to 25 cents a yard, and he at once silences all the ob-
jections of the Committee of Ways and Means, as
this would fix the duty at 30 per cent., just what
they want it. But suppose the manufacturer were
to reduce his price to 1 cent a yard, then the duty,
being 8 cents, would be 800 per cent. Horrid op-
pression! who would submit to pay a duty of 800
per cent.? Who could then refuse to go with the
Committee of Ways and Means for reducing such
enormous duties-5
ABSURDITIES OF THE REPORT.
But thfl Committee of Ways and Means say that
the object of this bill is to increase the revenue by
reducing the duties; yet, in the very same para-
graph, they say, that should the revenue be found
redundant, to avoid the horrid evils of deposites or
distribution among the States, the duties should be
inst'-intly i educed, so as to reduce the revenue to the
wants of the government. At this time, the com-
mittee say there js not revenue enough, and they
propose to increase it by reducing the duties; but
should it turn out that there is too much, then they
say reduce it by reducing the duties. Thus a re-
duction of duties is alike effectual with the commit-
tee for a reduction or for an increase of revenue. Ex-
cellent disciples of Dr. Sangrado, who had but one
remedy for all diseases—"bleeding and warm wa-
ter.'1 How such a palpable contradiction is to be
reconciled or explained, T am at a loss to conjec-
ture.
The committee proceed next to say that it is the
true policy of e\ery interest m the country, except
manufacturers, to advocate the proposed reduction
of duties, and they especially name agriculture.
JNfow, sir, in my opinion the reveise of this propo-
sition is ttue; agriculture is much more intacstcd in
the maintenance of the present protective tariff than
the manufacturer, and for the most obvious reasons:
high protective duties are calculated to induce in-
creased investment in manufactures; the effcct of
this is clearly to increase the demand for the raw
material and breadstuff's produced by the farmers;
and the necessary consequence of this increased de-
mand is to increase the price of everything the farm-
er has to sell, and, by increasing the quantity, re-
duce the price of manufactured goods. Thus the
protective policy enables the farmers to sell higher
and buy lower; while, on the other hand, increased
competition obliges the manufacturer to sell lower
and buy his supplies at higher rates; yet it is assert-
ed in this report, and in every anti-tariff speech, that
high protective duties are imposed for the benefit of
the manufacturer at the expense of the farmer. Now
I submit whether, practically, the opposite of this
proposition is not the truth; and whether such is not
the necessary and unavoidable result of the great
laws of demand and supply which regulate and con-
trol prices throughout the world.
But agriculture, is still further benefited by the
protective policy. By increasing manufactures, it
withdraws a portion of the capital and hands from
agriculture, and converts them into consumers m
stead of producers—into customers instead of
rivals; thus diminishing the quantity and increas-
ing the demand for agricultural supplies, and
at the same time increasing the supply and re-
ducing the price of the manufactured goods which
they get in exchange. Thus, in every point of
view in which the subject can be considered, the
farmer is more benefited than the manufacturer by
the adoption and maintenance of the protective poli-
cy. By way of illustration—suppose in a village
there is one manufacturing establishment of woollen
goods: here the surrounding farmers sell their wool
and other agricultural supplies; the manufacturer,
having a monopoly, regulates "his own prices, as
well as those of the farmers—he demands what he
pleases, and gives what he will. But suppose a high
protective tariff on woollen goods is passed, and in-
stead of one woollen factory there springs into ex-
istence five or six in this village: the existing mo-
nopoly is at once destroyed; there is six times the
demand for wool and provisions; this increased de-
mand necessarily increases the price of everything
the farmer has to sell, and by glutting the market
with six times the quantity of woollen goods the
price is necessarily reduced. Such are the plain
and obvious benefits of the protective policy to the
farmers; yet politicians would have them believe
that they are oppressed and ruined by this policy,
which can alone render them prosperous.
MR. VAN BUREN'S OPINIONS ON THE TA-
RIFF.
And here, sir, it may not be improper to remark
that Mr. Van Buren entirely concurs with the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means. In his letter to the
Indiana convention he says: "The great body of
mechanics and laborers in every branch of business,
whose welfare should be an object of unceasing so-
licitude on the part of every public man, have been
the greatest sufferers by our high protective tariff,
and would continue so to be were that policy per-
sisted in, is to my mind too clear to require further
elucidation." But he further says, what is much
nearer the truth, that high duties are in jurious to the
manufacturers themselves, for whose especial bene-
fit, we are told by the committee, these high duties
are imposed. Mr. Van Buren says: "Excess of
duties, which tempt to an undue and ruinous in-
vestment of capital in their business, is injurious to
the manufacturers. And how5 By promoting compe-
tition, and reducing prices* But is not this for the
benefit of the consumers?
But this is not all Mr. Van Buren says against
the protective policy: he says, "the period has
passed away when a protectee tariff can be kept up
in this country;1' that the tariff "increases the poor
man's taxes in an inverse ratio to his ability to
pay;" and that direct taxation is a more equal and
just system of revenue than duties on foreign goods.
These, sir, are Mr. Van Buren's opinions upon the
tariff, as proclaimed to the world in his Indiana
letter.
But let us look a little into the details and practi-
cal operation of this bill on the great agricultural,
manufacturing, and mechanical interests of our
country.
Jn the first place, it greatly reduces the duties on
wool and woollens of all kmds; three-fourths of the
duties, and more, are taken from coarse cottons and
calicoes;lead is robbed of more than nme-trnths of
its protection. But Pennsylvania seems to be sin-
gled out for destruction. Her iron, her coal, her
glass, her paper, her salt, and leather, are all struck
down together, nnd we are to go to England for
iron, coal, glass, &c. Yes, sir, in 1842, we imported
more than four millions of bushels of coal, under a
duty of $1 75 per ton. This bill reduces it to one
dollar. Of couise you must double, and doubtless
you will treble the quantity imported; and for
what5 To increase the ic-venue. A few days ago
Pennsylvania passed a resolution unanimously in-
structing us to go for protection "without regard to
revenue." Yes, sir, these are the words, protec-
tion "without regard to revenue;" and here we are
reversing the rule, going for a bill for revenue with-
out regard to protection; voting for 20,000 copies of
a report m favor of this anti-lanff, anti-American,
and British bill.
But this bill greatly, very greatly, reduces the du-
ties on whiskey, brandy, gin, and wine. We must
import whiskey and brandy for revenue, and give the
rich their wine atone-half the present duty, and they
must of course drink double the quantity or we lose
revenue. What say you, temperance men, to this?
You must all get drunk on foreign spirits to increase
the revenue. Tax the poor by direct State taxation,
and let the rich indulge in wine, brandy, silks, and
laces at lower rate*.' No, put the duties high on
luxuries, and distribute the proceeds of the land
among the States to relieve the poor from taxation.
Sir, pass this bill to lighten the burdens of the rich,
while you double the burdens, reduce the wages,
and destroy the labor of mechanics and the poor,
and go home and hear what they have to say on the
subject.
The following abstract from table C, in the appendix to
the report of the committee, will show the practical Op-
eration of this bill upon the mechanical, agricultural,
and manufacturing interests of the country.

Gunpowder 
The 12th section of the bill provides that, after the
1st of September, 1835, all the duties over 25 cent,
are to be reduced to that horizontal standard, 25 per
cent.
In 1842, we imported more 4,000,000 of gallons of
wine, and nearly 2,000,000 gallons of distilled spirits.
England imposes' 2,700 per cent, duty on our whis-
key, and we, by way of reciprocity, now propose
to reduce our duties on English and Irish whiskey
(1,650,000 gallons of which, with other distilled
spirits, was imported in 1842) to a mere nominal
duty! The duty of 25 cents on wheat would also
be affected. This bill brings all duties above 30 per
cent, down to 30 per cent.—a horizontal tariff, ex-
cept on a few specific articles; and in one year more
it brings the duties down to 25 per cent., discrimi-
nating for revenue below that standard. This was
bringing it nearly down to Mr. Van Buren's stand-
ard, established in his famous Indiana letter. „His
maximum was 25 per cent, till the debt was paid,
and then 20 percent., discriminating for revenue be-
low that amount, but in no case above it for protec-
tion. This was Mr. Van Buren's plan, as laia down
in that letter, to which he referred gentlemen who
might be disposed to doubt it.
[Here Mr. S. was interrupted by a call to order
from a V$m Buren man.]
Mr. S. said gentlemen seemed very solicitous
about order when their favorite men and measures
were assailed, but nothing was out of order when it
suited their purpose. Why was not the gentleman
from Ohio [Mr. Duncan] called to order, when, on
a bill to fix the time of holding the elections, he had
introduced a coon—a, dead coon—and had dissect^
