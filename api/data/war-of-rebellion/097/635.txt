Major-General ORD:

Your troops are the nearest to Prince Edward Court-House, unless the Fifth Corps is between you and them. That corps was ordered to Prince Edward last night, and on receipt of the news of our captures at 12 p. m. the order was reiterated for them to push on without waiting for morning. Mackenzie is probably there now.
