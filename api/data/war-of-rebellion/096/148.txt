road. I have given the necessary directions for the command to get under arms quickly (General Mott had already done so for his division), and have sent out to see what the facts amount to. Will report as soon as I learn. Have sent to other parts of the picket-line. It is probable the enemy have thought the working parties on the front were intended to conceal some operations elsewhere. Heretofore they have had a few vedettes only in the Cummings fields.

Major S. CARNCROSS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Army Corps:

MAJOR: I have just returned from the picket-line. It appears that a foraging party came out of the woods into the corn-field in front of the Wyatt house to get some corn. The number variously estimated from 30 to 100; the latter is probably the maximum. I sent a party out to the woods for the purpose of feeling of them; will notify you as soon as I hear.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. MOTT,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,January 16, 1865-2.10 p.m.

Brevet Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

My staff officer has returned and reports that the enemy has no skirmish line in the fields of the Cummings house on the Vaughan road, but merely the usual cavalry vedettes. The report of their having a skirmish line there grew out of the fact that a skirmish line of about fifty men advanced into the corn-field, in front of Colonel Wyatt's house to cover the collection of some corn, but retired upon the advance of a party from our outposts. Reports from all other parts of the picket-line show everything to be quiet.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
