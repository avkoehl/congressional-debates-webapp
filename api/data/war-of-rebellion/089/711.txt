Sanders' old brigade, Mahone's division; one from Wallace's brigade, Bushrod Johnson's division; one from Ransom's brigade, Bushrod Johnson's division; total, nine. They report no recent changes in enemy's position. The vague report received several days ago that Wallace's brigade had gone south was undoubtedly erroneous from fact of our receiving a man from that command to-day.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
