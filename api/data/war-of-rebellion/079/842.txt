HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,Gadsden, Ala., October 22, 1864.

Major General JOSEPH WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: General Hood desires to shift the cavalry forces of the army as follows: You will take command of Iverson's and the forces now under your command, and take charge of the line from Iverson's right to the Tennessee River, if necessary. Brigadier- General Jackson, with the brigades of Armstrong and Ross, will move to the rear of the army and report to General Hood. Get in communication with Jackson as soon as possible, that this change may be carried out without injury to any portion of the line now occupied by our cavalry. Ferguson's brigade will remain under your command. I will write Jackson this morning to the same effect, and in the future your left and Jackson's right must be kept in communication. You must endeavor to keep the Atlanta and Dalton railroad constantly cut, and should the enemy evacuate Atlanta you must destroy all the road north of the Chattahoochee, and constantly concentrating toward your left be prepared to join at any time the main body of the army. Should the enemy advance anywhere you will drive off all the stock in their front and destroy all the mills within ten miles of their lines of march, retarding them as much as possible.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. P. MASON,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major General JOSEPH WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry:

Headquarters to-night are three miles and a half WEST of Bennettsville Post-Office. General Hood desires that should the movements of the enemy require it you will extend your left to the Tennessee to cover the present movement of the army, and oppose, if necessary, any main movement the enemy might make toward the Tennessee. This is to be done until Jackson can get up. When Jackson gets up he will take charge of this duty, and you will proceed to carry out the instructions written you this morning.

A. P. MASON,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
