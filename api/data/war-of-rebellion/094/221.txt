TWO MILES WEST OF HILLSBOROUGH PIKE, December 16, 1864-12.45 p. m.

General WILSON:

GENERAL: The enemy crossed a number of their wagons over the Harpeth at the railroad bridge (Northwestern railroad). Destroyed the railroad bridge, but their troops moved by the road represented on our map as leaving the Hardin pike at the brick church. I am now going into line facing the Hillsborough pike, and will attack as soon as I get my battery up and in position. The enemy pressed a guide to conduct him here, and I have him. He says the rebs had with them twelve pieces of artillery, which they had in use yesterday on the Charlotte and Hardin pikes. Away to my left I can hear small-arms; if our cavalry, and it can press on, they will be in the rear of the guns. The dismounted brigade could not keep up, and I left it on the Hardin pike. All the rebs on my right and rear are beyond the Big Harpeth, and that brigade covers the city. I could not overtake the enemy if I had kept them with me. I hope all is satisfactory. have not heard from Croxton to-day. Have taken a few more prisoners since my last.

Respectfully,

R. W. JOHNSON,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier General R. W. JOHNSON,Commanding Sixth Division, Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: Yours received. General Wilson has gone to the front. Hatch, Knipe, and Croxton have gone in and won, capturing some prisoners. I understand the infantry have carried the works and taken a large number of prisoners. Cannot vouch for the truth of the report, but am inclined to believe it. Enemy said to be running at all points. Your movements are satisfactory to General Wilson.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,
