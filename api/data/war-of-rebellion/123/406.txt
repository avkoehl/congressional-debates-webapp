Governor MORGAN,

Albany:

If it will save time and bring the troops quicker you can attach temporarily surplus companies to a full regiment, to be organized and consolidated when time and the safety of the country admits. I cannot tell you how precious time is now. Every man is needed at once. If the troops cannot be paid the bounty and advance pay as quick as they can be sent off, do not detain them, but start them and telegraph me, and they shall be paid here on arrival.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
