DECATUR, May 11, 1864.

Colonel SAWYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have information beyond question that the enemy is concentrating a large force in neighborhood of Florence, both infantry and cavalry; they have several batteries. We know of at least a brigade of infantry; how much more we have not learned. Forrest's and Jackson's cavalry constitute a part of the force. In my opinion part of Polk's command is operating with Forrest's cavalry, and steps should be taken at once to meet a strong movement. Forced is still lying at Clifton with a large train and 900 beef-cattle. General Gresham is at Athens with two brigades and a battery; he should not move from there if this force is to be met. No time should be lost in sending troops forward.

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
