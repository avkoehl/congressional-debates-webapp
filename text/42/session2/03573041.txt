)epartments, and 110 end of plunder lying
round loosely among the various appropria-
tions, patriotically voted by Congress out of
|the pockets of the people.
THE MINORITY BILL.
As for the bill which is offered by a minor-
ity of the committee, it is a rank protective
' leasure. It began by placing tea and coffee
forthwith on the free list, and throws more
or less of everything else overboard to float
;pig and bar and scroll and scrap iron and
|?-6teel, which it does not touch at all. It pre-
E'jtends to relieve the country from forty or fifty
f: millions in duties and taxes, but it puts twice
I- and thrice this sum into the pockets of a few
constituents of its supporters. It gives the
"farmer free tea and coffee, but it lowers the
; market for his products. It plunders him in
the price of every agricultural implement or
tool, every nail, screw, brad, horseshoe, or
pound of wire he is obliged to buy. It makes
a profound fifty million bow to the assembled
.'..Ration; then picks its pockets of several hun-
vdred millions.
In this bill, on salt in bulk, the duty is reduced
(dfrom eighteen cents per one hundred pounds to
-'eight cents, and in sacks from twenty four cents
"per one hundred pounds to twelve cents perone
i,.hundred pounds. Why should we not at once
jrepeal this contemptible tax? It is nearly two
v hundred per cent. It has had enough bounty.
*;Why not put it on the free list with coal? But
■the details of this bill will be cared for when
we come to the discussion by clauses.
Are these measures such as the situation of
the country demands? Do they afford a sub-
[ stantial relief to the people? Do they loosen
the shackles of commerce, lighten the farmer's
. burden, or lessen the hours of the workiag-
man's toil? Do they represent the wishes of
jkjany portion of this nation ? What need to ask
".'these questions? The majority bill affords
some relief; the other very little, and that little
.coupled with robbery of and insult to the
f..;natiou. They loosen nothing, except it be
;the morals of the people, who cannot fail to
be edified by the examples of disingenuous-
ness they contain. They lighten nothing;
they lessen nothing. They are shams ; shams
differing less in kind than degree; and as
shams I shall oppose them. What the country
demands is not pretended, but real reduction;
and not reduction for the sake of Pennsyl-
vania iron-masters, but reduction for the sake
of reduction!
The time is fast going by when this House
will possess the opportunity it now enjoys to
earn the gratitude of the nation. Slowly but
steadily all those features which follow in the
wake of privileges, monopolies, and central-
ized power and wealth, and.which have tended
to degrade and oppress the people of Europe,
are appearing upon our horizon.
DANGER TO LIBERTY.
They threaten the liberties of the people. As
well might we at once go back to the barbaric
days^ of Akbar or Charlemagne, and yield
implicit obedience to the feudal lord and the
lord's superior. There is no despotism so
galling as that of a Government constituted to
secure, but fatal to oppress the people in their
rights. If there be one act which society and
its agent, the Government, should foster in
freedom, it is trade. The time has gone by
when Governments should undertake to fix
the prices of goods or regulate the processes
of manufacture; The struggle has been long.
It is marked by tears and blood through the
centuries: but in the language of John Stuart
Mill, in his book on Liberty—
" The cheapness and good quality of commodities
are most effectually provided for by leaving the pro-
ducers and sellers perfectly free, under the sole
check of equal freedom to the buyers for supplying
themselves elsewhere."
The gentleman from Pennsylvania would
limit liberty by a wall of flame, shutting us in to
our own land. He pictures to us our country,
gifted with all soils, all climates, all mineral
resources, and with the powers of wind, water,
and fuel, on a grander scale than the nations of
Europe combined. His picture is entrancing.
It would be patriotic if it were not heretical.
His love of country is so ardent that lie
would have no soil send us its product. He
would, if consistent, grow the palm in Ver-
mont and the pepper in New York. He would
have the balmy climes of Algeria here to repro-
duce the dear orange and the expensive date.
He would have no wind to turn the mills which
pump water on the arid plains of California
which blow from China; and no breeze to move
our ships on our lakes which comes from Lab-
rador ! He would so restrain our liberty of
commerce that no water which touched the
Canadian shore should turn a wheel to make
flour for the people ; for he would foster home
industry by requiring all wheels to be made
of iron and all motive power come from coal 1
The fuel which God has planted within the
hills of his State should be the only sources
of caloric to run the spindles of New England
or the saw-mills of Michigan! In fine, he
would obscure the very shine of heaven, since
the sun in its chariot visits other climes and
other people ;■ and in its stead, if consistent,
he would light up the darkness of our earth,
which he would desire, by gas made from
Pennsylvania carbon and through conduits
made of native iron.
The liberty I love has a larger range and a
better principle. It would bind the world,
npt. by isolating nations, but by the civilizing
amenities of interchange. It would make the
weakness of every man and every nation the
strength of all by that law of interdependence
which is the philosophy of humanity and the
glory of our faith.
On behalf of the progressive, scientific econ-
omists of this age and country; on behalf of
a rigorous and fair expenditure and an honest
collection of our revenues; on behalf of
natural equity outraged by this tariff system ;
oti behalf of the impoverished and unrepre-
sented masses, and on behalf of that spirit of
liberty which is destined to make our star
more beautiful and glorious as the ages roll
on, I enter my protest against all schemes
which make Government the organ of oppres-
sion and wrong, and not the refuge of the
people.
