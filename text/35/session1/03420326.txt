APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Slavery Agitation, etc.—Mr. Tapjpan.
[.March 31,
IIo. of Reps.
people of the North from the charges which are
constantly made, here and elsewhere, of slavery
agitation, of aggression upon the rights of the
South, and of entertaining sentiments hostile to
the union of these States!
Sir, in behalf of the Republican party, for whom
on this question I think I can speak, and of the !
people of the North, I deny all and every of these ,
charges. And, in turn, 1 charge homo, wheie i
think it properly belongs, upon the nuiiifieu'Mn
and disunion party of the South, or, as it is ,
pleased to call itself in these latter days, the <{ so- ,
cession" party, with being the real aggressors—
•withentertaining views and sentimems hostile to .
the Union, and with being the cause of ail or
nearly all the slavery agitation m tins country for
the last twenty years !
Mr. Chairman, the people of the North have no 1
wish or design to improperly interfere with (he
rights of the Sooth. They know that slavery, ■
as it exists in the States, is beyond their control. ,
True, they may hope, through the mlluence of;
public opinion and the progress of Christianity .
and civilization, to one day see the system ame-
liorated or entirely done away. Hut further than \
this, they have no designs upon the "■ peculiar in- |
sutution" of the southern States. Ay, they know j
that that institution h.>s us chief strength and .-.up- i
port, to-day, in t! e Union of t!ur,e Stales, and they 1
ore loyal and faithful to ihat Union. i ui at the :
rame tune, sir, they love liberty, and cherish m
their heart of hi arts the great principles which !
called this Government into being. They know, 1
too, what tt\e system of shivery is, and, m com- 1
moa with the early and great men of the South, •
they hold it to be a great moral, social,and polit- :
iral evil—a foul blot upon the otherwise lair es- ,
cutcheon o[* our common country. They know :
that, at the jo: r.iat ion of the Go vet nmeni, slavery
was r< Raided i>v uil the grcatnnd good men. South
an well as North, as a tempoury evil, and so in-
consistent with the principles upon which the war
of the .Revolution was foierlit, that (he leathers
would not allow the word slavery to go mie the
Constitution. They moieover knew something
of the effects of the syMem. They knew that it
impoverishes the soil, that it rUards progress, t hat
it opposes education and mental develop men t, that
U degrades labor, (which is tin' insignia <>f noujl-
ii y in the North,) and biingf. cvetyUim;', du\/n to
im own level. And within a few yea'..-! thov h.ive
seen the caily p'dicv m ivluieni ?<> shivery aban-
doned , and m pi ice of the doctrine ,wh i eh ii inner !y
obtained, that it was a local institution, e listing
only by positive law, they now see ui\ attempt
made to tfVTioY\u/.i: the system, and, through
the doctrines of the Pre.ml nt5s message and the
lued Scott deci-'ion, to pl.mt it in the very heart
of the frr fHtate*\
Sir, onealVr .mother, w ha\e :;een ihe oh! } ind-
maiks and bann r.s etected by our fal hern against
the encroachments of this nyetem lemovud; we
have seen the pligh ted fai th oi' I lie nation tiamp'ed
upon,that if might find S"i.pr ;.r.d vei e; ami no"/,
when with bold and deiiant amiude itthieateus
to invade nur very firesides and hcsrthslones, be-
cause we icsist and defend oiuscUea, we ate de-
nounced as " fanatics and agiiatois.'' No, s:r; wo
ot'the North are not responsible for this slavery
a",nation; but the respouMbdity, as I haw, said,
belongs to the exUeuiiMS—the nullification paity
of the Soul h ,who, through i heir mad and offensive
schemes oi* slavery propng^mlism, have brought
about the present suite of afiairs.
When 1 speak of the disunion party of the
^outh, I do not include the enthe people of the
southern Stales, nor do I jom in an indiscriminate
warfare upon all who may happ-m to hold slaves.
1 know there are thousands upon thousands of
moderate, conservative, and pa.Uiot c men theie,
who, at heart, condemn these ultra and oifensive
schemes as much us we do. Uut I speak of that
portion of them who threetcn us with southern
conventions, and a dissolution of the Union, m
case the Congress of the United States should ful
To give it> sancjon to one of the most hare-faced
swindles that ever disgraced any age or nur coo n-
t- y ! I believe that a party exists at the South,
headed by violent men, who seem bent on con-
trolling the Government to their own purposes,
and, failing m this, to withdraw from the Union,
and set up a southern confedeiat y. "Whether
they mean this or not, they preach it, to effect
ulterior objects; and a system of terrorism has j
been established, before which the moderate men i
of that section can make no headway. '
And, what is more alarming still, this party, 1
which General Jackson in 1833 put his lied uoon .
! and for the tune " crushed out," to-dny ha.-^om- !
' plcte control of the Democratic organization of (
! the country ! And, to the shame and everlasting i
! disgrace of a portion of that party in the North, ;
; it seems willing, forthe sakeof the few miserable 1
crumbs which may fall from the table of ns mas- ,
! ter, to bow down and do its impeiious bidding !
, Talk of " northern fanaticism He itso. Some- :
■ thing may well be pardoned to the spnit of Lib- t
1 eily ; but for thespirit which would carry slavery \
J into a Territoiy wrested from the peopie of the !
| bee States by a breach of plighted faith, against j
: the earnest remonstrance of an overwhelming ma- j
! jority of the people of that Territory, and at the ,
| expense of every principle of truth, honor, jus- i
- tic, and fair-dealing among men, nothing can be !
' said by way of excuse or palliation. It is a gross, j
! outrageous, impudent, and unmitigated wrong, 1
| And it is a series of aggressions such as this ;
! u inch has driven the people ot the North wheie j
' they are obliged to make a stand in self-deiense, ,
! or see all those principles which are dear to fiee- ;
i iiu a, and winch they have always been twVghtio j
; cheiish and icvere, forever n pudiated and ttani- \
' plod under foot. And, by tin: blessing of God, !
i we will defend ourselves, and resist tins gieat
i wrong. And if for this the (Jiuoti is to be de-
I stroyed, 1, for one, cannot help it. "Life is not
' l-o dear, nor peace so sweet,*' nor the Union so
sacred, as to be '• purchase d at the expense of
i chains and slavery," and the humiliation of an
I j i'ni ire people, m who0e 1 ems yet courses the blood
j of men who lought for Lii5i.ji.iY on Hunker Hill!
j! Sir, the origin of thi > nulhLration party, and
!, f his disunion sentiment, at the Mouth, iies deeper
h than the slavery question. It had Us use fmm
'| other causes, and the slavery question has only
I j been ser/.ed upon, m the language of Mr. Calhoun,
j, to ltjnrce. the is'itr" upon the ])eople of the Noi th.
j| The Uepresentatives ot'the same party which, in
il ib')"2, attempted nulhiicalion (m account of the
tat iff, to-day threaten to dissolve the Union if Le-
compion is (ejected! Mr. Chairman, I do not
know but that theie h.is always been a disunion
party at the South, but it ne\<_r fnuly showed its
i liead till about As I have intimated, the
; i land'policy was then the ostensible cause of gi iev-
anee,and it is not a little remark.ible that the very
man who did more than all oth<*rs at the South
p in fuorofthe poliry of a protective tariff in 1 o 1G,
p in fifteen years afterwards undertook to break up
P the Confederacy because of the very policy which
!i lie had helped tomaugurate. The ostensible cause,
!' then, as I have said, was the taritf; at other pe-
,, rtods since that time, and now, it is slavery. Hut
one lead,og reason then and nov,au [ believe, isa
j| secret discontent on the part of a portion of the
,, South, at some fancied inequality in the working
| j of the Federal Govei nmeuf, by which, as is sup-
|' posed, the North have gamed some undue ad van t-
n nge over the South. It is seen that, while the
;'Nojtli is sieadily advancing in population, in
'\ u'e.tnh, rind intelligence, and m e\erything that
| j rnaiks the progi e«s of a great o r.d piospet ous ]•>> o-

\ Imt m th'^ bursting asunder of the futtern.d bonds
j v. hieh have so long united the Jiuuth with the
•! North. Sir, the aatse of this a-iparfiit decay of the
Si.vlk muj be looked for nearer hoius. A population
; of ignorant, unthrifty slaves, who, according to
!! the iionoi able Senator from SouiliCandina," have
M no aspirations,'' is not a foimdaiion on which to
h build the material industry of anatioa; nor is itin
II the midst of such a community that manufactuies
!| and the mechanic arts will flourish, or that agri-
h cu 11v^ will be best de.veloped. Slaves cannot
build snips, nor sail nor navigate them when they
are built. If, then, notwithstanding the compar-
ative barrenness ot her soil and the rigor of her
j climate, the North has continued to prosper,whilst
i decay and death are stamped upon the once fertile
: fields of the South, the cause is found, not in any
J undue advantage which the North derives fiom
! the Government, but ie«u:ts wholly from the syo-
: tern of nfcE i.abou, which, notwithstanding tbe
; contempt in winch such iabcu is held at the Soinh,
; L at once the pride and glory of the fice Stafes.
, .And, Mr. Chauman, have not the people of
the North just cause for alarm, when they see the
; systematic attempt of leading statesmen to dc-
' bdveh the public sentiment of the countiy upon
■ tii is question of labor, which forms tne veiy M b-
! stratum of society m the fiee States*3 And, m
1 passing, I cannot help referring to some of the
i sentiments which have been put forth m the
; course of this debate on this subject. They have
I been quoted repeatedly before, but I desire to
: embody them in my remarks, that the hou< st,
! hard-woi king, intelligentmcn of the old "Grauho
I State," may v-'e in what estimation they are hold
j by those who are striving to-day to push slavery
! juto the Territory which so recently belonged to
' them and to their free institutions !
I 1 quote, first, from a speech of honorable An-
' mtLW Joiixson, of Tennessee, recently delivered
m the Senate, and which i listened to myself:

I! It is said, Mr. Chairman, that the " evil which
! men do lives after them,but the good is often in-
II tcrred with their bones." Sir,these sentiments,
, I striking as they do at the very foundation of
11 the true sources of wealth and greatness of a na-
| tion, will live long after their authors have passed
! from earth, and the good they may have done
shall be forgotten. And, sir, these are not the
j; senuments of obscure men, having but little io-
; \ ilu'-iUa', but they are the sentiments of leading
j 1 " Democrats ,}—of men, without whose active aid
(i and cooperation (and of others holding the smne
}j sonr[monl« ) the present so-called "Democratic "
] j organization could not hold together a single day.
'' >Sir, with us at the North we have no "clioS
! which leads progress, civilization, and reiine-
! me'it," as contradistinguished from those who
| Lbor—and we want none. We hold that soci-
| ety so constituted is a false and urmtocraue state
• of fcocirty, and we repudiate it. It is no part of
] true Democracy. AH classes of our people arc
i obliged to work—and yet they are capable of lead-
' j ingin " progress, in civilization, and refinement."
11 Vrom the earliest period of youth, they are taught
j| that industry is one of the highest virtues—that
'| laboris honorable, and idleness disreputable. We
| have noaristoeraticc!ass,born to luxury and ease,
j and who subsist upon the unpaid toil of an inlV-
! nor class. Nor do we hold that the highest state
