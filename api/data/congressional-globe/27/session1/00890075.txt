CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
IfB
tion to the 4th of March, 1841, amounted to $1,800.
He said it was no debt, evidenced by bond or co-
venant—it was a high moral obligation on the part
of the nation to relieve the family of the illustrious
dead from the debt incurred by him in taking cffice.
He said General H. needed no praises from the
Minister at Pans His fame was graven with an
iron pen upon a rock foipver.
Mr. THOMPSON of KentucV y now, amid a
hundred voices, arose and debated the constitu-
tional principle involved in the question. He
claimed that the Constitution was established
to administer public justice with liberality. He
said they could pay, under the granted powers, a
debt of charity, a debt of gratitude, and a dtbt of
feeling. He said as the President was dead, the |
constitutional limit as to his pay whi'e living was
removed, and they hada right, now he was dead,
to give him additional pay for his cervices while
living, amount'rg fo as much as they pleased He
referred to Venezuela, to Alexandria, and to other
precedents, to show that Congre s could make gra-
tuities. He '■aid be Jid no' suppose trie bte Chief
Magistrate, who opposed Gei.erai Harreo", v oí M
tear from the hero's brow ore laurel, or b aoken
his memory, so dear to fame.
Mr. W. COST JOHNSON now got the floor,
and, after summing up the case briefly, said he
should vote upon the bill on me ground of equity
alone, and sat down.
Mr. IRWIN of Fennsylvama now rose and
asked that the i-entiments of General Hanson's
old soldiers m ght be heard on the floor He said
that he had presented the proceeding- of a rreeiirg
of old soldier5, held at Pn* bu'g-, in Penn yk'sma,
and asked that they nrphi De read, And they «ere
read accc aig'y.
Mr. YOUNG of New York now moved that the
committee rise and report tie bul,
Mr. GORDON of New York here rose, bu* the
cries of "question, question," were so loul that it
was impossible fi t him to be heard.
Mr. BROWN of Pennsylvania appealed to the
majority of the House on the great induce they
were practising, aftt r their own friends had been
heard, to put member  of the minority down by
such d. orderl/ proceedings He wou'd ask whe-
ther the speeches of the majon'y had not been Six
to one.
Mr GORDON f «am ro-°, aja t'st dea'enmg
cries of "question,' ' hear him,' eto Autr the
noise had somewhat subsided,
Mr. Gordon «aid, members of the ncjo-ity
were mistaken, if they imagined ne was thus to be
deprived of h's right to -peak. If what he was
about to say should prove unpalatable he could not
help it. The fact wai, that, having at last got the
floor, notwithstanding all the notoas attemp's to
deprive him of it, he was deter Lined to stand there
and say what he ift^nded, if it sboald be till mid-
night. If g-entlemen thoop: .t fit to cy "ordii, or-
der," when he v as not out of or er, nav, b fore
they had hea'd six wads, 1 °y m ght do it, íor u
would have -o effe-t ■ pro Vara.
Mr G. then ooserved that he was de-iroas of
saying a few word" to justify me amendment he
had offered, nr of in <rt rig §6 250, mcn-ad o'
$25,000.
He was ther proc e hn% to make -ome remaiks

he was in offiu- al-o tn .t dunu ih term tor
which he wa-elected, he shnuj not receive any
other emolument.
Now, the sum of $¿5,000 per year was all the
President coald receive by the 'aw and (Jonstitu- j
tion.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Sek-
geant] had contended that the ami unt claimed in
bill was a dtbt. Well, then, if that were so; if it
were due, the heirs of the President, as his legal
representatives, could get the money from the De-
partment , without coming to Congress for it.
He main'amed there was no debt o win? by the
United Stales to the lat  President     But what was
proposed by this bilH    Why to increase the emolu-
ment of the President by giving him $25,000 for a
quarter of a year's salary'   The Constitution pro-
vided that his salary should be neither  mcrrased
' nor diminished during the term of offl-r; and that
j he should receive nc other emolument; anajet heie
I was a bill to make one quarter's salary equal to
that for a whole vear.
I ask the friends of this bill, said Mr Q. whether
thoy do not see that this is an increase of the emolu-
ment in direct oopo-ition to the express letter of
•he law, which expressly says there shall be no in-
crease of the emolument during the term'
I ask, how can gentlemen, who have come here,
and sfforn solemnly to support the Constitution,
x ote for a bill which violates the provisions of the
Constitution' Yes, for a bill wmch oropceí to
make s quarter's salaiy equal to that for a whole
wear. Nay, there is an amendment now pending
to make it $50,000, and another member had the
hardihood to say §100 000. I wish this to go out
to the country and to the people, that they may
understa id the matter.
At this time the cries of "order" and "question"
were reres ed and such was ihe diso der, that
^earcelv a word cou'd be heard.
After the Chaii had res'ored somethitig ap-
proaching to order,
Mr. GORDON resold He had no doubt but
that certain rnembeis on that floor wou'd rather
not hear what he had to say. He waB, however,
not to be put down by any such means; a*d if his
remarks pressed he could not help it.
He had beard it asserted on the floor that there
was no law fix1!)? the sa'ary of the Pre-idenf, and
the manner m which it should be pa'd But he
would show gentleman ihe law, and then, perhap ,
they would believe
Mr G   then read the law of September 1789,
which provides that  the salary of the Presidínt
shall be paid qua.terly, atid p'o raía.
The following a copy of the law referred to:
' Be it enacted bj the &note and House of Representa

Mr GORDON.    I i?'n te'l these members who
are eoitinually shouting "order," ihat I am not to
be rut down by any such tyrannical moans.   They
mistake me, if they think I am to be driven from
my purpose by any such measures.
The Constitution provided that the compensation
of the President should be paid at certain and sta-
"ted periods of time for the services rendered. But
if the services have ceased, for what, I ask, is the
salary?
Mr. Gordon then replied to the cases of pre-
cedent quoted by the gentleman from Massachu-
setts, and controverted the conclusions drawn from
them.
Mr. G. said I trust I have magnanimity enough
to rise above precedents, and to vote as the Consti-
tution requires me to vote.
He, Mr. G. would admit that the gentleman
frem Pennsylvania [Mr. Sebgeant] was correct in
stating that Congress had paid ihe funeral expen-
ses of its officers, &c. Now, he had no manner of
objection to paying the funeral expenses of the
late President, but to increase the emolument by
givirg a year's salary for a quarter's service, he
could not vote for any such measure.
Mr. G. then replied to that portion of the remarks
of Mr. Sergeant, where he had urged that the eyes
of the world were upon us, &c and that as we had
taken our place among the nations, it became us to
act with magnanimity. Mr. G. agreed with all
that had been said about this country having taken
its place among the nations of the earth; but the
only way to preserve the respect ©f the people of
the Old World, was to act up to the spirit of Re-
publicanism If they acted m that manner, they
wou'd then be respected by the great family of na-
tion-, [Here the cries of "order" were renewed.]
Aftpr s^rae further remarks, Mr. G. proceeded to
sia'e that he lu>d heard that Mrs Harrison was not
poo- He had been told upon high authority that
the late President hid an estate worth $100,000,
on which his widow woull be entitled to a dower.
But if the estate were encumbered, why, let this
money be paid to the legal heirs, so that justice
might be done to the estale, instead of placing
the discretionary power m the hands of the widow,
who might or might not do justice. Yes, he had
heard tha' this estate was wnhm the sound of the
bells of Cincinnati, worth #100.000, and yet the
law w as to be violated to give |S5,000 to the Widow.
[%iuch noise ]
Mr. G said that he was not to be coughed or
cried do>sn; gentlemen mistook their man, if fh«y
«uppo.-ed that he was to be afftcted by the machine-
ry of th  poli"cal party.   He meant to vote as the
Ccnst.tu'ion commanded him to vote.   He joined
issue with ihe opposition before the country upon
this breach of the Constitution, and he should be
hewd    He supposed the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vniafMr. Síigeant] would be pieaied wuh the
splendid eximples of the old World, but he should
not.    He a-ki'd if this Government had a human
existence to shower down sympathy, or was it a
untop oí S Me-, bound by tneCo  titution and to be
