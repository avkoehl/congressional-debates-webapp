amendments are.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report of
the committee will be again read.
Mr. DAVIS. 1 can explain to the Senator from
New York. The report recites merely the amend-

Mr. DAVIS. The first amendment was for an
appropriation for materials to continue the con-
struction of quarters for subaltern officers stationed
at that post. The House disagreed to it, and in
this conference the House recede. The next was
an amendment to that amendment by the House.

the term of studies at West Point. The House
recede from that amendment. The Senate, then,
in ten different items, appended an amendment to
provide for a regiment of mounted volunteers in
Texas. The House disagreed, and the Senate
recede.

the Committee on Military Affairs, whether, in
those amendments, the four years'or five years'
term of study at West Point was retained?
Mr. DAVIS. Neither. "We leave it just in
the way it was.
Mr. MALLORY. That is all I wish to ask.
The report of the committee was concurred in.
