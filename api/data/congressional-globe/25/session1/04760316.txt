gentleman was his only ground of opposition But, sir, it is
one oí hit  positions, urged by him upon tin- con&idudtion < 1
the rom mi tee, and consequently one which he must have le
gardedas woithy of the appiobation of his constituents I
maintain, in íeply, thitit is a consideration wholly unworthy
the appiobation of the People of hi« great State, and one that
is unworthy of influencing the legislation of this House upon
this subject
But, sir ll I could believe the honorable gentleman's- const!
tuents wete capable of being moved by sordid cot^ideiations
in this matter—if I believed that then support or opposition
to this bill i", through then icpieseiitatives upon this ¿our to
turn upon the amount of doll us ant cents that then ¡State is to
win or lose the keeping and use of, I then bir, might claim their
support of this measure upon mfoimation tint iscommuni
cated in the repoit ©f the Secretary ol the Treasury now befóte
us And I call the attention of the honoiable gentlem in to the
fact In the tah'e appended to the Secretary's report, showing
the condition of the public money, Í find tint there it, &tiil on
deporte m the hanks of Onto the sum ol ti^ht hundred and
eighty thousand tight hundred and eighty six dollar, Ihj

in that State of &211 800—besides ©277,050 mote not yet pdid

tion of pecuniary benefit m this mattei is it not obvious tint

Bury on deposite undu the existing state of things thtn hei

she will be like!y to kei f> it, lot some time to come at least ?
(Mr Loomis hue lemarked that die People of Ohio weie
not leapmj the beneiits  d these depositee, but they weie only
in the keeping of the banks oí that btatr which were the pio
perty of only a small paition ol the People of Ohio ]

norable gentleman well knows, as does every other poison, tha

the whole people, are deiivmg abenehtfiom its being within
the State    Funda held by your bank  ire hinds u^ul hyihe

Ohio is sordid (an imputation which finds no place inmy.tr

atstake in availmghenclfof the credit which the Tieisury
mint inevitably moid to the deposite banks within the State

and of its friends relative to the efficiency of tht, local binks to

exhibited entitled to weight Bu' en has the much boaotcd
Bank of the United States ¡>te-od m its sfien^th, and fu filled us
obligations, unlike and distinguished from the ma^ of 1 cil and
deposite banks throughout the country" iSo, sn it h is failed,
as the latter have and sunk beneath the accumulated embar
rassments of the mercantile and trading woild, and while its
fuend* ask that it be not regdided with censure foi it, they as
suieUly ought to accord the same chaiitablejudgment towards
the friends of the local institutions, and while its filends assert
that the promises of the National Admimstiation lelative to
local b mko have faded they should be willing to admit aNo
dint the piomises of themselves relative to their favorite insti
tution have (ailed in like mannti Thus the account stands
square again between the pames
The gentleman (rom Pennsylvania (Mr Biddle) furthei
s,ays there is no occasion foi legislation on this  matter, if the
Sccietary oi the Treasiny should not have the money to pay
to the bu cs on the fir¡>t oí Octobei, he can say so to the Stales,
ii be tohill have it, let the deposite act be lulfilled hii, this
rt commendation of the honoi ible gentleman doe* not accord
with th it hankness lor which he hab eoi ten led, ami to which
I have givui my assent 11 lelation to the pioviaions of this let
He his said we ought to exprco^ cleaily in oin «ict what we
mean Ibiy so also lf( meant to upeal this fourth instalment
I would say so If Im ant only to postponeits payment, I would
sty so And if f truant toh ive the Seeietaiy euhei pay ovei oi
n >tpay ovei this instaíment to the States IwouUUayso Í would
not leave the Mieietary without any positive duections on the
subject ile has told us that the present condition of the 1 lea
suty will not admit hi  paying it Isow,it wc mean he sdiall
pav it, neveuheless, let us siy so and give Inm the meant*
Instead ofordenng ten millions ofTiea-suiy drafts, let usoidei
for hi  u^e twenty millions, and enable him to pay themstal
ment of deposite to the fetates II we don't mean this, let us
tell him so, and eithei lepcil oi postpone the payment it
would be unjust to the Sccretaiy, on the informan n he has
given 11=; to íeiuse legislation on th s subject one way or the
othei We would be unjust to tiie States to do ¡=o If the pay
ment be not postponed oi iept,aled, the States will expect the
piynuntingood faith We mu-st not and ought not to leave
this subject to miceuainty and it would be the height of m
justice to all concuned for this Hou^eto do so
Mr Chan man, 1 have but a Aw temaiksto add, ind these

specitl connection with the subject now undei debate But
thegentlcman Aom Pennsylvania, (Mi Biddle,) and also the

brought it to bear upon this measure, as an Administration

REMARKS OF MR. BRIGGS,

tould notget out ot it any definite idea o*"the íciual state of the

stiifiing under this wmt of jierspieaci y in relation to that
document \et some gentlemen had called it a clear and

by way of enh^htening the Hon e on the present state of our

Secietary's report, but had gone io the Dtpaitment in leison
dud fiom the man isciipt papers iound there made up his esfi
mites is exhibited in the prime I fibles now before us }f
that cleat headed gentleman with all h s talents and reputation
as an accountant, could not «atj«fy himself of the financial
state of the Treasury b> investigating the repoit of the Secre
tary, but was compelled to seek information among the mass
of imprinted paper  on the files of the Depaitment u is not
süange that tho&e who make no pretensions to leainng m this
"Tieasurypcience" should be in doubt and difficulty
Nor had that gentlemen (Mr Cambreleng) been alone in his
laborious researches    The gentlemen from Virginia, Mary
land, Ohio, and New York together with the gentleman from
Tennessee, on the other side, have all given their statements,
and yet he would venture a Yankee's "guesy thattheie weie
neither two of the whole number which would be found, on
comparison, to agtee \!1 this may go to prove that the Secie
tary of the Tieastuy's report is a íemarkably clear document,
I admit, but if that be so, it also goes to prove that the mem
bcis who have favored us with their statements do not possess
equal clearness with the Secretaiy It may be all very clear f
yet was he, (Mr Iíriggs ) m íelation to the matter, very much
in the predicament ol a ceitam old lat'y  who was asked how
she liked a very metaphysical  ort of sermon she had been
listening to ' Why, ' said the good woman, " it was the best
■sermon lever heaid in the whole course of my life, and 1
would have given any thing on earth if 1 could only have
understood it '"
Thus perplexed, he (Mi l> ) had been compelled to use his
own lights, dim as they were, m ordei to asceitarn the object
lie hid in vam heen ^.eekir e for, and he had come to the con
elusion that theie was no pecuniaiy necessity in the case
which shoul 1 impel Cong i ess to postpone the piovisiens of
the act oi Juno 1836 m relation to the deposites of the surp'us
revenue nor did he believe that the Secietary of the Treasuiy,
if he shuuld appear beioie us, would say that he believed there
would be a deficiency ot means in the Tieasuiy to meet the
demands, of the corient yeai, though he might say that a part
of those means would not be immediately available In rela
tion to the law of Tune 1836, it sti uck Inm (Mi B ) as passing
stiange that, in a Ilou&e consisting to so great an extent of
well lead and eipeucnced lawyeis, theie could be suth w de
difTeienccs of opinion as to the legal impoit and character of
that act Foi himself though a 1 twyei by piolescion, he did
not pietend to the potsession of any very high legal abilities,
yet, to his mind, the meaning and intention of that law appeared
clear and plain It provides that ' the mone) which bhall be
in the Tieasury on the fiistday of January, 1837, íeservins the
sum of five millions, «hall he deposited with the seveial States
in pnpoition to their íespective íepresentatioiib in the Sena's
and House of Representativ es as shall oy law authorize their
lieaeureis oi other competent authorities to receive the same
on the ter nib heiemafter specified "
The terms and conditions upon which the money was to be
deposited with the Stales ate set foith in the act Inpuisuance
ot the dnecti ns of the act, the teccielary of the Treasury c©m
municated to the several States the law authon/mg kitn to
dehvei to them the public money, and called on them to say
whrthei they would comply with its provibion* Every totate
in this Unien, in the solemn form of legislative enactment, ion
sented and agieed to receive the money and to (omply with
the conditions and requirements oí the law of tongiesb In
compliance and fulfilment of thib pioposition, made by the
fioveinment of the United States, and accepted by the Legi&la
ture*  ot the state  tlnec fouiths of the whole ^um which was
in the Tieasury onuhe 1st day of January, 1837, (the whole
amount of which was name*! by the Secietaiy m his pioposi
tion to them ) has been paid over to the States
Can this Government now withhold the fourth instalment
without the consent of the states, and not violate the plain pro
visions of their own IaW*
The money wot. to be passed over to the States in four equal
instalments, at fixed penods It was to be repaid by them
when wanted by the Secretaiy of the Tieasury, to meet ap
propi lations made by law, in ratable proportions, and in sums
not exceeding a cei tain amount byany one State
No piovisionm law autlionzee the Secretary to withhold, in
any sta'e of the case, any portion of the money Nor does
Congiessreserve to itself the light oi power to do any such
tlnnsr
The crentleman from Virginia (Mr Joies) asks if Congtess
meant tlut this money should be deposited with the States, if
the Government should want it foi its own purposes] I an
swir that Congiess mtendc Í that alt the money which should
be in the Treasury on the first day of Januaiy, 1837, after de
ducting five millions of dollar, should be depo ned with the
Sutes To piove thii internum, I refer to the explicit, unam
biguous and umjuahfitd language of then own law, made to
aetomph li this identical put pose
The gentleman from'Vugmia says, the fact that this thirty
s^ven millions were to be paid to the Stales by instalments does
not change the character of the tian&action between the Gene
lal government and the State" I concui with him fully The
instalments were arranged for the accommodation of the b inks
who held that money on deposite As between the Govern
ment and the States, the case is the same as though the whole
amount liad been f aid out at once It it had b^en so paid, nei
ther the Seen taiy under tht law, noi Coni,ie&s, by new legis
lation, would have the light to lecall the money in anydiflei
ent mannet than is provided by the terms of the law as propos
ed to and accepted by, the State" This fourth instalment con
wtuutes a much larger amwunt than could be demanded from
the bt itcs- and c innot, thereioie in good laith to them, be with
held without their consent What Congress would have done
ifthey hadan icipated a different &tate ol the Ireasuiy i* one
thing, what they actually did and what are the rights <if the
Staith resulting from their action, is entirelv another thing
But (sail Mr I* ) we are told that this is not a contiact, and
not binding asswh because no amount i& put down in the word
irur oi the act What do you want sir, (a^kedhf > of an amount?
All tb.il shall lemain m the Treasury, after deducting $5,000,000,
on the appointed day that is ' the amount " and ii there were
any doubt about it, the Secretaiy of the lreaQuiy immell has
kindly helped uí, out of the dilemma ny telling us, in dollars
an I cents what that' amount' wa& Well, this, being a«cer
tamed the States have a claim tor then sevenl proportions of
it, as soon as they comply with the co iditioiu of the act Ih^y
did so compiv, and received thiee quaitei^ of the 'amount,'
ciccoidmg to the tenor of the contract, and meanwhile the other
Hiiar er was their own a& muchas that ilre-idy received, and
was so undei tood by them, a  well as by the Secietary of
the Treasury Several of the States hav e made appropriations
fflf the whole «¡uma" then own, enae'ed laws tor unemployment,
and predicate 1 all then action upon ¡tas then own And >et
the distinguished gentleman fiom Vnginia, (Mr lonetas well
as other professional men heie argue that this is no comract
What do gentlemen understand w ould constitute a contract? If
a proposition, consisting of various conditions aud limitations,
made by one party to another, accepted by that other, and three
fourths of its stipulations actually carried into effect, does not
come within the legal and common understanding of a contract,
I am unable to imagine what would
I will not say (said Mr  B ) that a case might not be put m
