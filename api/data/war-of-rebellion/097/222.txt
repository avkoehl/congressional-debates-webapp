A reporter of a Philadelphia newspaper obtained a copy of the order in my office, and the moment I heard it was suppressed I made search for him, but was unable to find him. The order was received by me at noon yesterday, and three copies sent to each regiment, but were recalled to-day. Upon being informed by the printer that the order was suppressed, I made it my personal business to visit the reporters and notify them.

CHARLES H. T. COLLIS,

Brevet Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, March 28, 1865-10.45 a. m.

C. A. BROWN,Superintendent Printing, City Point:

Recall Collis' orders. See that you get every one issued by you. See Cadwallader, and, if possible, Driscoll, correspondent Tribune, and McGregor, correspondent Associated Press, and get their copies. Tell them for me the order is suppressed. I think they will go up in to-day's boat; perhaps they are already gone.

GEO. D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

PRINTING DEPARTMENT, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, City Point, Va., March 28, 1865.

Colonel RUGGLES

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

I have recalled all the orders both from Generals Collis and Patrick. I saw Cadwallader and McGregor and notified them. The order was read on parade here last night. Several copies have gone to Washington from General Collis' headquarters and extracts by mail for publication. What shall I do in the matter?

C. A. BROWN,.
