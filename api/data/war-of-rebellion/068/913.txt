HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 19, 1864-9 a.m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to inform you that a detachment of 500 cavalry is posted on our right flank, which the commander of the brigade of infantry on this side of the Ny should communicate with. The pickets of the infantry should be well thrown out and well extended around the right. Tyler's division of infantry is massed in the vicinity of these headquarters, and is held ready for any service required of it.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

Has the officer commanding the detachment of cavalry on the right reported to you, or to any officer of your command? Does any one in your command know where his headquarters are?

The major-general commanding directs that when any groups of the enemy, although small, collect together within range some artillery should open upon them. Some such groups have been noticed on the open ground this morning.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I believe no one knows here who is in charge of the cavalry picket line, or where he is to be found. My line laps over his a little.
