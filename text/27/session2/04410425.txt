Southern títates, that, tou, was a thing to| be made light of, he
canseGreat Britain herself was m a condnion so precarious that
her, own people wer*1 as likely to overturn her Government as
it was to injure usat the South
I will not meet the gentleman on that question I believe
that Gieat Britain, like all the other powers of Europe and
more especially Fiance, (to whom we areadvi=ed to look as
our chief reliance,) is in a most precarious situation I believe
that they are all m danger of aire-nendous revolution, and none
so much as that very I\ mice 1 must say here (and I do not
know whether it will be \ery acceptable to this House) that if
ltbe true, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania intimates, that
the interference of our Minuter in France, by the publication oí
the pamphlet on which he bestowed s> í igh piai<*e, was the oc
casion of the refusal of France to ratify ihe quintuple treatv,I
do not huid tí at proceeding in as mu h idmnation. astheeen
*"*tJeman does It comes too near success in doing wrong Her
minister had sigied that treaty, and the lefusal to ratiiy it was
not based in the refusal by Fiance of the light of search, for
thaUaglit she had a'ieady gran'ed by oihei and independent
treaties now m force she is bound already on that subjtet
And 1 say that, foi the sake of the moral prmcip'es which go
vern the intercourse and conduct of nations France owes an ex
planation tothe world of her íefusal to ratify that treaty If it
be true that General Cisshas efíicted thisresult, I, for one, do
not thank him font Wot only because he has persuaded
France to break her faithand put beiself in the wrong in the
future controversies which ma) arise between her ait1 the o her
- parties to that treaty, but also because i' looks like an mtermed
dling with the political affairsofEurope it has the aspect of
engaging^ usin entangling alliances with foreign nations, the
veiy evil against which the venerable Washington and
the venerable Jefferson both so emphatically warned their
countrymen
In Washington's Farewell Address (a paper which had la'ely
been read in that Uall, and winch ought always le be read and
heard with the deepest reverence) there is a parag raph exi tess
]y devoted tothatsuhject And Mr Jeffersw mad-1 it asoit of
politic)! motto, to have"pea-^e, friendship, and commercnlre
iatioTis with all nations, but entangling alliances with none "
Suchhasbeen the policy of the United States from that time to
this And I must say that the pamphlet which was put imth
by our minister (ol which he did me the honoi to tend me a
copy, and which I have lead with the most meinund attention)
has suggested to me the question as to the piudenceand ■"xpe
diency of thu^s making us m a^y sou paitiesto the wan which
are ahead And Í here ask this IIou e and the country tobe
lleve that if the refusal nf France to rat fv the quintuple treaty
shall be persevere 1 m, (which I can scaicely believe possible,)
that the right of search has n it any part in the wars which may
lollow, and in which we aif in o-re danger of becoming en
tangled Tf v I <<ay, will form no ranm such wan It is no
question between Fiance and the 1 >ur P >weis Fiaice as

befoie she was aware of it, that the fleets and arms of Gieat
Britain had settled the que&tiui for her and she then,forthe
first time, gave bark and signed the league
And what will be our condition il m consequence of the m
tnguea of our minister we are involved ma Furopeanwar on
the hollow pretence of tins nght of search"? There is in the
French House of Deputies, which the gentleman (rom Ppnn
sylvania ed.y= w is influenced by General Cas'g in its iefu&al to
ratify, on interest whose constant aim is to t verthrow th*1 dy
nasty ofLouis Philippe,-ird destroy every lemnant of it a
party who aie much more bitterly opposed to him than any
portion of either House ol Congress is opposed either to Martin
VanBnrenor to John Tyler Ihey would annihilate li fa
mi ly root and blanch, and fin ever aboiish the monaichiéal
power he holds I will not enter upon the question by what
authority Louis Philippe holds his throne it is not a question
for this place oi for this time but I will say that Fi n re and
her repiesentative body have tint question clutched between
the parties which there prevail, and that, m this coming wai
which it seems this pamphlet of Mr Cass is to km lie up, I
would notgive a picayune for his ciown And this i* the state
of things in which we are invited to go to war with France lor
our ally'
[Mr Ingersoll Tne vote in the Chamber was nearly
unanimous ]
Very well, that makes no difference lam showing that what
the paity which refuses the ratification ateaftet is not the light
of search They mav thiowuustm Mr Cass's eyes, an J mako
himbehefethatit is, but tha i  not the question, I repeat, be
tween France and the allies nor was it the question m the
Chambei of Deputies Ihe gentleman &ays the vote was neai

that France never will go to war on the question of the right of
