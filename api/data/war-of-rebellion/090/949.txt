DARNESTOWN, August 28, 1864-12 m. (Received 9 p.m.)

Major ECKERT:

One of Major Fry's men, just in from Poolesville, reports rebels across and advancing toward this place. Does not know their force, but saw heavy skirmish line. Was twice fired on.

DARNESTOWN, August 28, 1864

I think the man (he belongs to the Thirteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry) has exaggerated; but no doubt a small force is this side of the river plundering. They were in Poolesville last night. Mr. Brewer, residing near mouth of Monocacy, advised some of his neighbors to take grain, &amp;c., to Washington, as there would be some excitement in that section to-night. Don't think they will come this far, but Major Waite has been advised and will keep watch.

RUPLEY,

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
