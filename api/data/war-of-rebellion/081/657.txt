General R. E. LEE,

Headquarters Army of Northern Virginia:

I have abandoned my lines on Bermuda Neck to concentrate all my forces here; skirmishers and pickets will leave there at daylight. Cannot these lines be occupied by your troops? The safety of our communication requires it. Five thousand or 6,000 men may do.

ORDERS.] HDQRS. DEPT. OF N. CAROLINA AND SOUTHERN VA.,

Petersburg, June 15, 1864 - 10.20 p. m.

It being necessary to withdraw from the lines before Bermuda Hundred for the defense of Petersburg Major-General Johnston will direct their immediate evacuation. The trains, artillery, and troops will be withdrawn at once, leaving the pickets and skirmishers to cover the movement until daylight or later if necessary. The trains upon crossing Swift Creek will be posted between it and the Appomattox under the direction of Lieutenant-Colonel Roman, department inspector-general, except such trains as are needed to follow the troops and artillery to Petersburg. Lieutenant-Colonel Roman will be found at the Swift Creek turnpike bridge. Gracie's brigade and two batteries of artillery (to be indicated by General Johnston), besides Martin's battery already in position, will be posted to guard all the fords and bridges on Swift Creek from Lovell's Ford to Brandon's Bridge, inclusive. Colonel Butler, commanding sub-district, and Lieutenant-Colonel Roman, inspector-general, will direct the arrangements. The rest of Johnson's command will move straight to Petersburg. The general will precede it and report to these headquarters. The pickets and skirmishers when withdrawn will concentrate at a point to be designated by General Johnston and be marched as one command to Petersburg, where they will be immediately sent to their respective regiments. Lieutenant-Colonel Waddy, department chief of ordnance, has received special instructions with regard to Battery Dantazler. Major-General Johnson will order all engineer tools to be collected and sent with the trains. Clingman's brigade will take a railroad train at Port Walthall Junction as soon as practicable, to follow Martin's brigade. Orders will be given to the pickets to have the usual camp-fires maintained throughout the night.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.
