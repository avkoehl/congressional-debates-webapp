trying to rally them without avail. Some are yet in the advance with white regiments who do not retreat. I see many prisoners, whether white or black I cannot say, going to the rebel rear, in numbers greater than we have taken.

The black troops are not doing well, but there are many reasons for their not acting well. They delay has been unfortunate, as undoubtedly the rebels have concentrated troops at that point along their covered way.

Yours, truly,

B. C. LUDLOW,

JONES' NECK, July 30, 1864.

General WEITZEL:

This a. m., after crossing all the troops except about 150 men, I swung the bridge down stream to the right bank of the river, where it is now anchored. I respectfully suggest that if the bridge is not to be used immediately that it be dismantled and removed to a more secure position than its present situation.

Captain of Engineers.
