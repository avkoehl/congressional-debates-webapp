Report of Colonel Peter T. Swaine, Ninety-ninth Ohio Infantry, commanding Second Brigade, of operations June 23- August 12.
HDQRS. SECOND Brigadier,* FIRST DIV., 23rd ARMY CORPS,Before Atlanta, Ga., August 12, 1864.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor herewith to furnish a report of the operations of my brigade in the present campaign from the time I was assigned to the command to the present date.

I assumed command June 23, 1864, the brigade, consisting of the Ninety-ninth Ohio Volunteer Infantry and the One hundred and twenty-third, One hundred and twenty-ninth, and One hundred and thirtieth Indiana Volunteer Infantry, being in reserve for the division on the right of the army, then attacking the foe at Kenesaw Mountain.

On the 26th and 27th the division advanced close to the enemy's lines, my brigade erecting and occupying part of the front line of works, and on the last day mentioned it participated in the demonstration then being made along the whole line, and lost heavily. On the 30th of June we were relieved by other troops during the night, and the division encamped in reserve at daylight next morning for breakfast only, and at 6 a. m. we were on the march to gain a position in the rear of the enemy's left flank south and west of Marietta, at the crossing of the Ruff's Station and Sandtown roads. After one of the most arduous day's work in the campaign, we gained the position we started for, gaining ground only be repeated suffering extremely from the broiling sun, many of the men falling from sunstroke as well as bullets. The One hundred and twenty-ninth Indiana Volunteers, Colonel Zollinger commanding, made a gallant charge during the day on a position where the enemy was supposed to be posted in force, the result of the charge proving the supposition to be erroneous. The daring charge, nevertheless, deserves mention for the bold and able manner in which it was conducted. The grand charge of the day, however, was made by Colonel McQuiston's regiment, the One hundred and twenty-third Indiana Volunteers. This regiment, with the skirmish line, charged the last and most formidable position of the enemy, moving across the open fields in face of the enemy's fire in as perfect order as on drill, colors flying and the voices of the men loudly cheering as they poured showers of bullets into the rapidly retreating ranks of the foe. This charge enabled us to occupy the desired position without further annoyance, and substantial works were immediately erected. The Ninety-ninth Ohio Volunteer Infantry and One hundred and thirtieth Indiana Volunteers participated in all these operations, and were as much under fire of the enemy as the regiments who made the two special charges mentioned. Lieutenant J. S. Purviance, One hundred and thirtieth Indiana Volunteers, acting aide-de-camp, was captured early in the day while boldly and fearlessly galloping to the front in the execution of his orders. On July the 4th my brigade was ordered to the support of General Dodge's command (Sixteenth Corps) and took position on his left; our skirmishers charged their lines that evening and they evacuated, and we occupied their works. The next day I rejoined my division. On the 6th of July
