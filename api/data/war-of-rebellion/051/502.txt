Report of Brigadier General Joseph B. Kershaw, C. S. Army, commanding McLaws' division.
HEADQUARTERS KERSHAW'S BRIGADE,Near Chattanooga, October 15, 1863.

MAJOR: I respectfully submit the following report of the operations of my own and Humphreys' brigades in the late battle of Chickamauga. The mention of the latter brigade is necessarily general from the fact that General Humphreys report did not pass through me, and being on foot during the engagement, I could only assume a very general command. I respectfully refer to the report of General Humphreys for more particular information of his movements.
