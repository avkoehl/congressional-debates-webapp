is somewhat strengthened by the information drawn the prisoners taken yesterday that Maryland Heights will be taken by General Lee on his return without any fighting . This plan may succeed, if the rebels can capture Washington and Baltimore and hold Pennsylvania ; not otherwise. June 25. - As it was apparent from signal stations and also from prisoners captured that the enemy was moving toward Pennsylvania, a sharp lookout was kept, and during the day the following telegrams were sent:

Two intelligent sergeants from the Ninth Alabama Regiment have just come in. They say they belong to A. P. Hill's corps, and that it is all on the Maryland side of the Potomac .

Headquarters, Maryland Heights, June 25, 1863-2 p. m.

Lieutenant Colonel Donn Piatt Chief of Staff:

Our 24-pounder howitzers all in position, but we require eight more to perfect our defenses . If possible, induce General Ripley to order them at once, with 160 rounds of assorted ammunition per gun If we are taken, it will be for want of these howitzers ; mark that . Will you sent me map of Harper's Ferry, which Colonel Raynolds says you have in the adjutant-general's office?
