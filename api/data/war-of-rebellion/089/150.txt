HEADQUARTERS,October 9, 1864 - 7.10 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I am glad to hear of your safe return.* All quiet along my lines. I got seventy-five deserters yesterday; shall have about the same number by the morning; have twenty odd now. I am sorry to say Birney is so sick with dysentery that I must let him go home or lose him. Shall I have the pleasure of seeing you in the morning?

HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,October 9, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Please express to the general my appreciation of his kindness in the matter of sending me home. My fortifications to Four-Mile Church are almost complete. General Birney is opening short and several roads to the rear, and I have explained to General Terry my plan of several roads through the woods, commencing from extreme left to extreme [right], and narrow as salient was approached. If General Kautz will make a good strong corduroy road, wide and ample, from Doctor Johnson's house to my right flank he could always withdraw. I regard the position as perfectly defensible.
