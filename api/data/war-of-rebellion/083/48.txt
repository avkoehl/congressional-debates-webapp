Whittemore, First Infantry California Volunteers, which is herewith transmitted.* My opinion of the country traveled over is that the country bordering on the Rio Negrito and Francisco is very rich in minerals. Copper I know is abundant,and is a fine looking gold country as I ever saw,and I think that the mountains contain great quantities of silver; but for agricultural purposes the country is of no value, as the stream all run through a deep rocky gorge until they empty into the Rio Gila.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH SMITH,
