this body; and, amid all the conflicts, personal and
political—which we all so deeply lament—making
friends of all parties, m proportion as he became
Jmown to his associates in this ball; and, so far as
I have known or heard, not one personal enemy to
the day ef his death.
In the dsscendmg line of the generations of men,
Mr. Hastings was one step downwards from my
own More than thirty years ago, his father, ih n
my personal and political friend, was a member of
this body, while I was representing the Legislature
of our native Commonwealth in the other branch
of the National Legislature In the ordinary
course of human affairs, it would have been more
to be expected that he should have been called to
perform for me the melancholy office of afflicted
friendship and respect which I am now perform-
ing for him He first came here with a bodily frame
robust and athletic; but, for the last two >ears, his
heaUh has b°en gradually declining During a large
portion of the present session of Congress though
faithfully here at his post, he has been disabled from
giving his attendance atthe daily meeting  of this
House, and, about one month since, as the ravages
of the destroyer were encroaching upon the sources
of life within him, he repaired to the Sulphur
Springs m Virginia, in. the faint hope of recovering
by the effect ol those salubrious waters; but, under
ihe operauon of irremediable disease, on the 17 h
of this month, he sank without a btruggle into the
lepóse of the grave, "by strangers honored and by
strangers mourned."
Mr. Hastings was never married- his parents
tave long «nee paid ths debt of nature. The
nearest and tenderest ties of human existence were
not lacerated by his death, but he left a surviving
"brother—himself a man of the highest respec
lability now or recently a member of the Senate^
cf the Commonwealth of Massachusetts—and he
left multitudes of friends, in whose memory he
will live as long as life remains with them, as, I
humbly hope and trust, he will Uve forever in the
■blessedness of a better world
Mr A then submitted the following resolutions;
■which were unanimously adopted
Resolved, 1 tiat this House his heard with deep sensibility

Wednesday, June 29,1842
The PRESIDENT pro tern, laid before the Sen-
ate a communication from the War Department,
made in compliance with a resolution of the Sen-
ale of the 24th mst, on the subject of the removal
of superintendents of the armories at Harper's
Ferry and Springfield. The communication gives
information that the civil superintendents of these
establishments were removed on the 15th April,
1841, by direction of the President of the United
States, and that no succes ors t-ave been appoint-
ed to either of said places, but that they have been
suffered to remain vacant, under a thorough con-
viction that a superintendent, not subject to the re-
sponsibilities of a military officer, was injurious to
the public service The communication al o
states that, under the law of February 8, 1815,
which places the public armories under the direc-
tion of the Ordnance department, an officer of the
ordnance corps was detailed to direct the concerns
of each of these armories, by the authority of ihe
President, under the regulations and i iStrustions
prescribed by the same authority.
