Report of the Secretary of "War.
War Department,
Washington City, November 14, 18GG.
Mr. President: Disbandmentof the volun-
teer forces in service at the time the rebel
armies surrendered; collecting the arms, ord-
nance. and military stores scattered over the
v ?t theater of war; the sale and disposition
of unserviceable material; storing in arsenals,
magazines, and depots that which might be
used; settling and adjusting war claims; re-
cruiting and organizing the regular Army under
the recent act; the establishment of posts and
garri'ons on the frontier and in the Indian
country ; testing the various improvements of
breech-loading small-arms, and supplying them
to the Army; practical experiments to deter-
mine the destructive power of projectiles and
the comparative resisting qualities of ma-
terials ; completing sea-board defenses and pro-
viding them with armaments; planning and
carrying on harbor and river improvements;
these, with the administration of the laws
relating to refugees, freedmen, and abandoned
lands, have constituted the chief operations of
the War Department during the past year.
The entire number of volunteer troops to be
Blustered out was, on May 1, 1805, 1,(KM,064,
and my last, annual report recounted the opera-
tion of disbanding this force until November
15, 1865, when 800,903 troops had been trans-
ported, mustered out, and paid. The work
was actively continued after that date, and on
January 20, 1866, 918,722 volunteers had been
mustered out; February 15, 952,452; March 10,
907,887 ; May 1, 980,782; June 30, 1,010,070;
November 1, 1,023.021 — leaving in service
11,043 volunteers, white and colored. The
aggregate reduction of the colored troops dur-
ing the year has been 75,024, and at this date
one regiment of artillery and thirteen of infant-
ry, numbering about 10,000 officers and enlisted
men, remain in the service. Commenced in
May, 1805, the work of discharging and return-
ing to their homes 1,034,004 volunteers would
have been completed within three months but
for the necessity of retaining in service part of ,
that force. Past experience shows that, should
any national emergency require a larger force
than is provided by the peace establishment,
armies could be swiftly organized to at least
the full strength of a million men. [
The reduction of the Army has been attended
by a corresponding reduction of material and
retrenchment of expenditures. The advanced
depots of the quartermaster's department,
which had been established as bases of opera-
tions, have been broken up; the greater part
of the material sold at advantageous rates or '
concentrated in five principal depots and arse-
nals; andall unnecessary employes discharged.
From May 1, 1865, to August 2, 1800, over !
207,000 horses and mules were sold lor $15,-
289,075 54. About 4,400 barracks, hospitals,
and other buildings have been sold during the
year for $447,873 14. The sale of irregularand
damaged clothing in store produced during the
fiscal year the sum of $902,770 45. Tlie fleet of
590 ocean transports in service on July 1,1865,
;, at a daily expense of $82,400, was reduced
before June 30, 1866, to 53 vessels, costing
§3,000 per diem, and mo3t of these have since
I been discharged, ocean transportation being
now almost entirely conducted by established
commercial lines of steamers. Of 202 vessels
which had been employed in inland transporta-
tion, at an expense of $3,193,533 28, none
were remaining in service on June 30, 1800;
sales of river transports, steamers, and barges
during the year are reported as amounting to
i $1,152,895 92. The rates of wagon transpor-
I tation in the Indian country have also been
reduced by favorable contracts. The military
jl railroads, which were operated during the war
u at a total expenditure of $45,422,719 15, and
| ■ which are officially reported to have reached
ji an extent of 2.030J miles, and to have pos-
ji sessed 433 engines and 0,005 cars, have all
| been transferred to companies or boards of
jj public works, upon condition of the adop-
tion of loyal organizations of directors. Cash
i sales of railroad equipment to the amount of
$3,400,739 33 are reported, and credit sales of
,, $7,444,073 22; upon the latter there have been
paid, principal and interest, $1,200,085 18;
leaving due to the United States, on June 30,
I! I860, principal and interest, $0,570,074 05.
Jj The military telegraph, which attained an ex-
l tent of 15,389 miles of lines constructed during
the period of hostilities, with a total expendi-
ture of $3,219,400 during tlie war, and $507,037
during the last fiscal year, has been discon-
j tinued, the material sold and disposed of, and
I ■ tlie employes discharged, only a few confiden-
I tia\ operators being still retained for cipher
i correspondence with commanders of important
districts.
i Such subsistence stores as could not be ro-
• ! tained for supplying the reduced Army have for
jj the most part been sold at satisfactory prices.
The sale of unserviceable and surplus stores
pertainingto the Signal corps has been effected:
most of the officers have been mustered out,
and the employes discharged.
All the temporary ordnance depots estab-
lished during the war, with the exception of
that at Ililton Head, where the work is in
progress but not completed, have been discon-
tinued, and the supplies have been sent to
arsenals for storage, or, when not worth the
cost of transportation, have been sold, lhe
expenditures at arsenals have been greatly
diminished, and their operations limited.
General hospitals, hospital transports, and
railroad trains, ambulance corps, and a num-
ber of medical purveying depots have been dis-
pensed with, nnd all perishable articles of med-
icines and hospital supplies, in excess of the
requirements of a peace establishment, have
been disposed of by public sale at advantageous
rates, and the reserved supplies concentrated
at live depots. The proceeds of old or surplus
medical and hospital property amount to
$4,044,201 59.
But the sale and disposition of these large
amounts of unserviceable and perishable stores
still leave on hand an adequate supply of war
material to meet any emergency that can pos-
sibly arise. The stock of clothing, equipage,
quartermaster, subsistence, hospital, and ord-
nance stores, arms, ammunition, and field ar-
tillery is sufficient for the immediate equipment
of large armies. The disbanded troops stand
ready to respond to the national call, and, with
our vast means of transportation and rapid or-
ganization developed during the war, they can
be organized, armed, equipped, and concen-
trated at whatever points military emergency
may require. While, therefore, the war ex-
penses nave been reduced to the footing of a
moderate and economical peace establishment,
the national military strength remains unim-
paired and in condition to be promptly put
forth.
While the reduction of the volunteer force
and the advantageous disposition or concen-
tration of war material were thus successfully
accomplished without diminishing the military
power of the country, recruiting and reorgan-
izing the regular Army favorably progressed.
In consequence of the difficulty in procuring
enlistments for the regular while so many men
were required for the volunteer service, one
hundred and fifty-three companies of the reg-
ular Army, as then authorized, were unor-
ganized on May 31, 1805, but in the middle of
the following July these companies had been
completed. Under the act of July 28, 1800,
the regular Army now comprises ten regiments,
or one hundred and twenty companies, of cav-
alry, five regiments, or sixty companies, of
artillery, and forty-five regiments, or four hun-
dred and fifty companies, of infantry ; of which
two cavalry and four infantry regiments are
composed of colored men, and four infantry
regiments of men who w6re wounded in the
lineof their duty. One regimentof white cav-
alry had been fully recruited on September 15;
the other regiment, assigned to the Pacific
coast, is very nearly completed. Forty-eight
of the fifty-four companies required to convert
into regiments the single battalions of the nine
three-battalion regiments of the former organ-
ization have been completed and sent to their
regiments. The four Veteran Reserve regi-
ments have been assigned to districts where
the men may be usefully employed in guard-
ing storehouses and cemeteries, and on simi-
lar duties. The colored regiments will be
recruited, as far as possible, from the colored
volunteers still in service. The law authorizes
an assignment of one hundred privates to a
company as the maximum, fifty being the min-
imum, and the maximum strength of the Army
is thus placed at 76,382, rank and file. The
present strength of companies is fixed at sixty-
four privates for cavalry, artillery, and infantry,
and one hundred and twenty-two privates for
light batteries of artillery, making an aggre-
gate strength of 54,302. As soon as the ranks
shall be well filled, it is designed to increase
the efficiency of the military force by raising
the standard of qualifications.
The troops in service were regularly paid,
and the demands of those discharged and mus-
tered out promptly met. During the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1866, $10,431,004 42
were disbursed to the Army and Military
Academy, $248,943,313 36 to volunteers ; and
in the disbursement of millions of dollars in
small sums, nnd amid great difficulties and
