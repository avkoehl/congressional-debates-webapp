Brigadier General R. INGALLS,

Chief Quartermaster, &amp;c., City Point:

General Rucker says do not send the ambulances until after the 300 wagons, teams, and drivers, which are most needed, are shipped. By that time he will be able to decide whether the ambulances will be necessary. Transports, I am assured, are not detained here twenty minutes after unloading. Georgianna, Kennebec, Balloon, and Charleston leave Baltimore this morning for City Point. Orders in regard to forage given as requested.

One deserter from Heth's division, who came in this morning, report that his division is lying on the right of Mahone's, extending to the railroad near the lead-works, but can give no other information.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Numbers 2. August 6, 1864.

The colonel commanding desires to congratulate the troops upon the promptness with which they assembled last night at the call to arms. It gave evidence of a spirit highly commendable and worthy of soldiers in the great cause in which we are engaged. To be thus prompt is the battle won. Hereafter in these sudden calls to arms the first regiment formed will have the honor of leading the column.

By command of Colonel Robert McAllister:

W. J. RUSLING,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
