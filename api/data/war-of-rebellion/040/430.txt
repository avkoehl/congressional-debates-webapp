NEW CREEK, VA.,

May 5, 1863 - 11 a. m.

Brigadier-General ROBERTS:

A citizens form near Crab Bottom reports that Imboden had only 1,700 men when he left there for Beverly. The rebel force in Western Virginia is unquestionably exaggerated.

The following dispatch just received:

ROWLESBURG, VA.

General KELLEY:

A scout, sent last Friday with Captain Snyder to Tucker, beyond Saint George, has come in, and confirm previous report - that the enemy, in large force were retreating through Beverly Saturday last. Nothing new here.

WEBSTER,

Colonel.

I know the scout (Snyder) to be reliable. I have no doubt that Jones' force is retreating via Beverly.

Brigadier-General.

GRAFTON, VA.,

May 5, 1863.

Lieutenant-Colonel CHEESBROUGH,

Baltimore, Md.:

The raiders have undoubtedly left Northwestern Virginia. If the general commanding approves, I will quietly and gradually move back a portion of the troops brought west to Harper's Ferry and points along the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad east of New Creek, in order to be prepared, should the rebels attempt a raid on the road either by the valley of the South Branch or the Shenandoah.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

The advance from Janelew in. drove the rebels from Janelew; some rebel prisoners taken; some rebels reported killed. No one on our side hurt.
