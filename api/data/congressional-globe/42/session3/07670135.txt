APPENDIX TO THE CONGKESSIONAL GLOBE.
135
42d Cong....3d Sess.
Louisville and Portland Comal—Mr. Dodds.
Ho. of Reps.
at this question as stated by that committee,
"view it in its true light, not as a sectional
matter, not as a favor to any particular State,
but as a right the people have to the care and
protection of great national interests by our na-
tional representatives." Now, the Govern-
ment has spent upon improvements of the
Bock Island and Des Moines rapids and St.
Mary's falls, river, and canal from 1824 up to
1878, $4,478,542, distributed as follows :
From 1824 to 1871:
Rock Island rapids  $739,650
Des Moines rapids  1,978,200
St. Mary's falls, river, and canal  360,692
In 1871:
Bock Island rapids  150,000
Des Moines rapids  260,000
St. Mary's falls, river, and canal  250,000
• In 1872:
Eock Island rapids  50,000
Des Moines rapids  400,000
St. Mary's falls, river, and canal, ($15,000
of which may be applied to secure the
right of way)  300,000
Total $4,478,542
Recapitulation,
Total for Eock Island rapids  $939,650
Total for Des Moines rapids  2,628,200
Total for St. Mary's falls, river and canal.. 910,692
And the above amount was well spent; it
was wise legislation to expend this money ; it
makes communications easy and transporta-
tion cheap ; it has done tenfold more good, it
has paid tenfold more on the investment than
the same amount of money expended in pub-
lic buildings, and brought far more substantial
results. 1 commend the legislation which
made these appropriations, and I am ready
bow to vote further sums if in the judgment
of the officers of the engineer department it
should be considerd necessary. But these
sums above stated were paid out of the gen-
eral Treasury, the commerce was not taxed
for it. Why, then, should this canal not be
placed upon the same footing as the improve-
ments on the Des Moines and Rock Island
rapids. Because it is in effect but the removal
of an obstruction in a noble river which is
navigable for five hundred miles above and five
hundred miles below it. The falls at Louisville
are such an obstruction that when there is a
stage of twenty feet of water at Pittsburg there
is but eight feet at the falls.
simple justice to the people of the ohio and
mississippi valleys demands that government
should take this work and reduce tolls.
And I submit to the House that while the
commerce of the country has contributed over
five and a half million dollars to this work,
the Government should surely not hesitate
about assuming a debt of $1,172,000, which
will give it the absolute ownership and control
and make the away around this great obstruc-
tion practically free, and put an end to an un-
wise and onerous exaction which hampers and
injures the internal commerce of the fourteen
States bordering on or directly connected with
these two great valleys. And while the people
of these States have always responded promptly
to the General Government in time of war, and
have fulfilled their duties in time of peace, and
are willing to vote liberally and generously
that the natural obstructions in the harbors of
the lakes and upon the seaboard shall be
improved at the general expense—and being
producers they contribute a very large share
of the income of the Government which
would be thus expended—they expect, yes, I
will put it stronger, for I think I know their
temper, they demand that this canal which
goes around a great national obstruction in
the Ohio, and for which their commerce has
been taxed five and a half million dollars,
shall be practically free, and that only tolls
shall be charged which will pay ordinary re-
pairs and expenses.
I have said that the people of these States
pay a large portion of the income of the Gov-
ernment, and the following tables will nwke
my words good:

The total collected from all the States and
Territories for the same period, was $1,609,-
871,368 57. Showing that the receipts of rev-
enue from these States on the Ohio valley were
over one third, about thirty-five per cent, of
the entire revenue of the whole country. But
these are not the only States whose internal
commerce would be benefited by the adoption
of the amendment of the gentleman from
Indiana. When we look at the amounts paid
by the States bordering on the Mississippi
valley, which are equally interested in their im-
provement, we find the total is $144,599,-
829 88, as is shown by the following table:
