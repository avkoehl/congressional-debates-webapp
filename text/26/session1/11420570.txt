APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June, 1840.
á6rH Conc -«-1st Skss.
Independent Treasury—Mr. Burke.
H. of Reps.
The converse o¡' the last two propositions are also
true.
10. Another canse tendió? to raise and depress
the prices of property, and ilia wages of labor, is
an increase or decrease of laxes. Taxes lead to
elevate prices in proportion 10 their amount. To
illustrate—if there were no taxes, every man
would enjoy all the income of his property and la-
bor. If he is tiled, that income is reduced in pro-
portion lo the amount of ihe tax. If his prop.Tly
and his labor cannot produce enough means to sup-
ply the amount taken by the Government for taxes,
it has precisely the same effect as diminishing the
demand in propotiion to the supply. Men will
not lessen their income if they can help it. If
from any cause th* amount of the products of pro-
perty and labor are diminished, they will increase
prices and wages, in order to make up the defi-
ciency. ITthe Government takes ten bushels of
grain, or a bale of «otton, or the value of a day's
work, or, what is the same thing, the citizen is
obliged to sell that amount, in order to obtain money
enough to pay his taxes, tha effect is precisely
the same as if the income, or supply of his pro-
property or labor, was reduced thai amount.
To make up the deficiency, he will add to the
prices of his property or the wages of his labor.
Again, for example, if five dollars are exacted from
the laborer, in the form of taxes, he mast increase
the wages of his labor enough to make np the de-
ficiency, and support himself and family as com-
fortably as he did before. All political econo-
mists, I believe, agree in the principle that taxes
tend to elevate prices and wages. In European
countries, where the laborer is the victim of a despo-
tism, either political or social, the capitalist pays
the tax, and labor, therefore, may not be so much
affected by taxes as in this country, where he shares
in the power of Government, and the support of its
burdens.
Havu g. Mr. Chairman, stated the propositions
or elements of the problem of fluctuations, I shall
now pioceed to demonstrate it by fací*, figures,
and plain deductions from them.
Fortunately for me, sir, there are two periods in
the history of this country parallel to each other in
causes and effects, which ationl a complete illus-
tration of the truth of the propositions I have just
laid down, so far as the actual connection of prac-
tical experience with abstract principle can be per-
ceived. 1 allude, sir, to those periods of our histo-
ry embracing the years 1812 to 1819, and the years
1833 to 1839 inclusive.
In the first period, two causes operated to pro-
duce the high prices which all descriptions of pro-
perty commanded, and particularly articles of pro-
vision.   Those causes were, an extraordinary ex-
pansion of the currency, and a decrease of supply
in proportion to the demand.   More remote causes
operated partially.    During the first two years of
the first period I have named, the country was in
a state of war.   The Government then was the
great consumer.   It wanted beef, pork, flour, and
oilier articles of provision for the support of the
armies which it was obliged to keep in the field
and to maintain.   The demand fir r all articles of
provision was vastly increased over ordinary times.
This, sir, had a powerful tendency to elevate prices.
The Government also called into its service large
bodies of men, most of whom were before engaged
in agricultural pursuits, and in the business of pro-
duction.   This tended to diminish the supply in
proportion to the demand, and thus to increase
prices.   These were two powerful causes,   ope-
raiing to enhance the prices of every kind of pro-
perty.    For, if agricultural products rise in pnce,
farms would also rise in value.    And if a large
portion of those who labored on farms, and in other
pursuits, were abstracted from such occupations to
the camp and field, as was the fact, the wages of
labor most necessarily rise.    Bjt there was still
another cause which operated at 'hat time, and also
fended, more powerfully thsn all oiher causes, to
enhance prices.    It was an extraordinary expan-
sion of the currency, growing, in a great measure,
oat of the exigencies of the Government, which
was compelled to put in requisition a vast amount
of pecuniary means, to sustain itself in the revere
and perilous conflict in which it was engaged.
A few facts will show the extent of the expan-
sion of the currency during that period. In 1811
the currency in circulation in the country was, of
paper, twenty-eight and .* half millions, and specie,
fifteen millions; making ¡a the whole forty-three
millions; (SeeMr. Woodbury's table of Circulation*,
Houst Dec. Ao 27, Qtt session 23ii Congress.) In
1813 it was estimated by Mr. Crawford, that the
circulation was $70,000,000. In 1815 it had swol-
len to $110,000,000; and üiks amount, says Mr.
Crawford, was probably augmented in 1816. In
1819, according to the same authority, the circula-
tion was contracted to $45,000,000, being a reduc-
of more than fifty per cent, from 1816; (Mr. Craw-
ford's Report, page 34, 1820; reprinted in House Doc.
No. 51, 23d Congress, 1st session )
Thus, the causes which operated to enhance
prices during the first period 1 have named, were,
first, a great demand, which was occa-.ionrd by the
Government being then a great consumer; second,
a diminished supply, occasioned by the abstraction
of productive labor from the business of produc-
tion; and third, and the most powerful of all the
causes, a great and rapid expansion of the curren-
cy, which rose, as before stated, from 1811 to 1816,
from $43,000,000 to $110,000,000, more than
doubling itself.
Those causes operated in 1812 and the interme-
diate years to 1816. During this year and 1817,
an extraordinary caase intervened to enhance the
price of agricultural products by decreasing the
supply. That cause was the cold season of 1816,
which ent off the crops of that year. At this pe-
riod commenced the retrograde movement, and a
most tremendous and disastrous revulsion followed,
arriving at its flood tide in 1819, which rocked this
country from centre to extremities, as if shaken
and cí nvulsed by an earthquake, the causes of
which I shall endeavor to assign before I sit down.
The effects of the causes 1 have assigned, for the
increase of prices during the first period I have se-
lected, are most strikingly visible in the prices of
beef, pork, flour, co'ton, wool, and almost every
other article of traffic and commerce, as will be
seen by the tables I bave been at great pains to ob-
tain, and which I now introduce.
The first table, Mr. Chairman, exhibits the
wholesale prices of beef, pork, flour, and nume-
rous other articles, obtained from the prises cur-
rent in the market of Boston, quoted from con-
temporaneous newspapers, the very best authority
that can be procured for trie facts embodied in the
table. The second table exhibits the prices of flour
in the market of Philadelphia, from 1812 to the
present year:

From these tables, Mr. Chairman, it appears
that beef, which in the market of Boston was
$12 50 per barrel, in 1812, rose to $18 in 1815 ;
pork from $9 to $18; flour from $10 to $13 in 1814;
corn from 88 cenis per bushel to $1 70; rye from
$1 CO to $2 25; and butter and cheese in the 'ame
proportion. Tea, coffee, and other articles of
foreign production, consumed in families, were sub-
ject to the same fluctuation.
In the Philadelphia market, floor rose from
$8 92 per barrel to $11 69 in 1817, which year
was the acme oí high prices.
The operations of the Government from 1812
to- 1915, gave the impulse to the expan-
sion of business, and the inflation of price ;
but that impulse continued to be felt after
the Government had ceased to be the con-
sumer, and the labor abstracted by it bad re-
turned to its original pursuits. The great opera-
tions of lha war, carried on by the Government,
engendered a fever of speculation and overaction,
very similar to that through which we have just
passed. The banks, as I have said before, ex-
panded their issues and "facilities," increasing th*
circulation of the country from $43,000,000 in 1811
to $110,000,000 in 1816- This led to a vast sys-
tem of overtrading and speculation, which was
followed by the revulsion of 1819, and which was
more disastrous and desolating in its consequences
than any calamity that has ever yet befallen this
country. The Effects of that fever of speculation,
sir, were seen in every form of business. But the
most unerring indications of the state of the
times are to be found in the increase of
the sales of the public lands, which rosé
from $835,427 in 1813, to $3,274,428, in
1819, wb«n the bubble of inflation and extra-
vagance burst. The excess of imports ever ex-
ijo , during the period embraced in th* years
oo    to   1819,   was   $182^95,846   «Terafeing
