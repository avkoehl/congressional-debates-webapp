General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Everything remains about the same along our lines. The heavy firing of yesterday was caused by our people endeavoring to put a stop to the enemy's working parties. They were planting a new mortar battery on the Fort Rice and Sedgwick front. Two deserters came in last night and report that General Gracie was killed yesterday by a shell; also a captain and two men.

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., December 4, 1864 - 10 a. m.

Major-General BUTLER:

I feel great anxiety to see the Wilmington expedition off, both on account of the present fine weather, which we can expect no great continuance of, and because Sherman may now be expected to strike the sea-coast any day, leaving Bragg free to return. I think it advisable for you to notify Admiral Porter and get off without any delay, with or without your powder boat.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Admiral PORTER:

When can you be ready with our little experiment? Captain Edson, ordnance officer at fort, will put ordnance stores at your disposal. Time is valuable from the news we get.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

NORFOLK, VA., December 4, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

We are ready for the 150 tons of powder. Will you give directions to have it bagged ready to go on board?

Rear-Admiral.
