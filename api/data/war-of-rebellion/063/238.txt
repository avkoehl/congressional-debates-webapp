WARRENSBURG, April 20, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis:

MAJOR: For the information of the commanding general I have the honor to state that the following items of intelligence are furnished me by parties whose statements are worthy of credence: Dr. Bledsoe, of Boone County, formerly a surgeon in the rebel Army, now living at home, sends word to me by Major Suess, chief of cavalry, that he has seen letters from (Arkansas) Price's army, which say that Price has two brigades of mounted troops and is mounting two brigades of infantry, the whole to make a raid into Missouri. Bledsoe states that the writer is near Price's headquarters, and he thinks that the information is worthy of consideration. Another, a returned captain, under the amnesty, now in La Fayette County, advises me, through a Cumberland preacher by the name of Rea, who vouches for the truthfulness of the returned rebel, that the officers and soldiers in Price's army are fully determined to return to Missouri this summer, in small bands, for the purpose of carrying on a guerrilla warfare if they are not led here by their officers in a body.

These rumors are a repetition of many other similar ones from other sources, but these parties evidently believe what they say. I forward it for what it is worth.

I am, very truly, your obedient servant,

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS CENTRAL DISTRICT OF MISSOURI,Warrensburg, April 20, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis:

MAJOR: I have the honor to state, for the information of the major-general commanding, that, in consequence of the delay in laying the track of the Pacific Railroad from Dresden arising from the want of labor, I have moved one company and part of another of the Ninth Minnesota east of Knobnoster and camped them on the line of construction, and have authorized the officer in command to allow all but the necessary camp guard to work for the contractors. The soldiers are receiving $ 2 per diem extra for their work. About a company of them are employed and are laying one-half mile of track per day. There are but 3 citizen track-layers at work. The road will be completed to the Knobs this month. In order that the military organization may be preserved, the men are camped on the work and move their tents as the road progresses; march to their work under arms, stack them, and work by them as far as practicable.

If there are no interruptions, the company will now be able to complete the road to this place next month.

I am, very truly, your obedient servant,

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
