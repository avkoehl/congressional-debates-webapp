Volunteer Service—Mr. Johnson, of Kentucky.
Ho. of Reps.
arraign them before the bar of the country on
this criminal charge, and he spoke -with confi-
dence of tluir anticipated condemnation In the
gieat contest that is going on here, and has long
11 en going on, betwi t n law loss power on the one
side, and constitutional power on the other, and
after so many triumphs of the formtr over the
latter, perhaps he is not extiavagant or wild in
his expectation of another in this appeal to the
people This attempt to make tin defense of the
Constitution a crime against the. country, whuh
before has been repeatedly made, and with too
mmh success, I consider as oik among the many
sickly svmptoms of our expiring liberties, and
of the rapid approaches of death to our free Gov-
ernment We have lived toseeit, and have seen
it in this ver> case, a noble sentiment of devo-
tion to the ( (institution—a sentiment that would
have done honor to Roman virtue in the best
days of Rome and which, in bettci days of this
Republic, would have found an echo in cveiy
American bosom, denounced as a sentiment little
short of treason to the country, and the denun-
ciation received with a tempest of applause—I
w.ll not, for I am not permitted to say where,
but where, I may all places it say, of ought least
to have been expected And this noble senti-
ment of devotion to the Constitution, which
ought to have made the author the idol of the
people, is relied upon as a torch to kindle the
popular indignation against him And, for this
incendiary purpose, this torch is, by an extraor-
dinary effort, to be carried to every region, and
applied to every nook and corner of our Wide
domain. Yes, it is so, shut our eyes to the mel-
ancholy fact as we may, this Constitution—the
noblest fabric ever raised on earth by human wis-
dom for human liberty—is fast giving vvav , this
toirent of lawless power is forcing it from its
foundations, the people look on and see column
falling after column, and they look on with un-
concern, nay, ms.ead of stemming, they yield,
they add themselves to it, and swell the toirent,
they seem to have eaten of the insane root, and
to be madly in love with their own d> struction
How else could they be invoked to ab]ure the
great defender of the Constitution as a traitor to
iis country, and to take a fervid sentiment of
devotion to the Constitution as the evidence of
his guilt >
But let him not despond or falter in his
course, let him still pursue, as he hitherto has
done, "that fame which follows, not that which
is run after, that fame which, sooner or later,
never fails to do justice to the pursuit of noble
ends by noble means " And if our free Repub-
lic is doomed to perish, of which the signs are
so many and so portentous, and by her own
suicidal hands, still she will live in history, and
History, the dispenser of Tame, will charge her-
self with his Oh ' let him think how poor are
all the honors of office, compared to the glory of
being a chosen theme for the Muse of Histoiy to
celebrate, to be her Piomethean fire, to enkindle
in the human breast the flame of patriotism in all
after times' Let him recollect that, whenever we
think of the great men w ho have made the glory
of any age or country, we never think of the
offices they have filled, however dignified No,
these are sunk and lost out of sight, we think
only of that splendor, of that halo of glory
which their minds and their achievements have
thrown around them. Who now ever thinks of
Demosthenes as the Senator of the Areopagus,
as the Archon of Athens, as the Embassador so
often to so many States, or as the acknowledged
chief and leader of the Grecian Confederacy for
so many years' No, we think of him as the
devoted patriot who bared his bosom and breasted
the storm which he saw gathering and coming to
overwhelm the liberties of his country, and
which did come—did overwhelm these liberties,
and break with a fearful and fatal violence on his
own head, and we think, too, of that'' resistless
eloquence" which, in that cause, "shook the
arsenal, and fulmined over Greece to Macedón,
and Artaxerxes's throne ," whose animating
sounds, at this distance of time, after the revo-
lution of so many ages, still vibrate on the
human ear, and whose stirring appeals still influ-
ente and carry with him the human heart.
VOLUNTEER SERVICE
REMARKS OF HON  R   M   JOHNSON,
OF KENTUCKY,
In the House of Representatives,
-4pril2l, 1836.
The bill authonzing the President of the Un.tí d
States to accept the service of Volunteers, being
under consideration,
Mr JOHNSON rose and said
Mr Chuehix It is not my intention to de-
tain the committee, except foi averv briefexpla-
nation of the object of the bill, for the measure
winch it proposes requms dispatch The letter
of the Secretary of War, which I will here íe-
quest the Clerk to read, shows the necessity of
immediate action
Vv en Department  Apiil 18,1836
^ir    In answer to vour inquiry, I hive the honor to
Mate thuviriou   n poits winch have reached the Depart
nit nt load to the beliet that the Indian1- upon the we>t( rn
frontier are in a state of considerable uneasiness, and that
disturbances with them are antieipued     It is ni\ lmpres
won th( «afity of that frontier requires tint i road should
be opened, and a cordon of po ts established along it in
confornnu with the plan recommended in my report to the
chairman of the Military ( oinnnttce ol the Senate, and
communicated in mv letter to vou of 19th Tt bruary , and
Í would further recommend that the necessary law should
be passed as soon as convenient, in order that no unneees
sary delay may take place m the arrangements of the De
part men t
I have further to state, in conformity with your «ugges
tion, that in the event of anv difficulties among the Indians,
I consider the measure propo ed by the Military Commit
tee, of aMovving volunteer coips to be takenmto service for
a term not exteed ng twelve months, to be discharged as
nineli sooner as tin public interest will permit ven un
portant and one which, it adopted t annot fail to be more
efficient and economical than the pr cent method of re
striding th( servicis of the nuhtia to three months
\ ery respectfully, your most obedient servant,
LEW    CASS
Hon  E M Jon" soN,
Cliairman Committee on Military Jtjfairy,
House of Representatives
The bill now before the committee authorizes
the President to accept the services of volunteers
for a term not exceeding one year, but to be dis-
charged at an earlier period if the public serv ice
will permit The existing law authorizes the
President to call out the militia for a term not
exceeding three months, for the object specified
in the Constitution, namely, to repel invasion,
suppress insuirection, or to enforce the laws of
the country The bill before the committee pro-
vides, that in lieu of a requisition upon the militia
indiscriminately, without consulting the will or
convenience of those who maybe called upon,
he may accept of such as shall volunteer their
service, and that, instead of being required to
discharge them for new subsidies, he may con-
tinue them in service for a year, if the public
safety should require that length of service It
does not authorize him to accept then seivice for
any other object than what is specified in the
existing law, and in the Constitution, nor does it
change the principle of the existing law in any
other respect w hatev er
The advantages, both to the public service and
to the civil community, of volunteers over mili-
tia drafts, are certainly very great and obvious
The militia laws contemplate no difference of cir-
cumstances or condition among citizens The
farmer may be competir d to leav e his field at a
moment in which the loss of one month would
prove a sacrifice of the whole year's produce It
may be when he has prepared his. knd for thf seed,
but before he has sowed or planted it, or it may
be when his ciop is ripening, and the whole may
Eensh for want of gathering The mechanic may
e called from his work at a time when its neg-
lect would ruin his whole business Bothnuy
be called away when their families are in the most
critical situation, and when the sacrifice w ould be
greater than could be remunerated by any pecu-
niary consideration But volunteers will proffer
their services when no such sacrifices are re-
quired They will be persons without dependent
families, or whose affairs are in a state that will
permit their absence without great inconvenience.
The greater propoition of them will be young
men, who are animated by the ardor of youth,
impelled by the thirst of glory, urged by the fire
of patriotism, and willing to learn the duties of
the camp and the field, while indulging the nov-
elties so grateful to youthful minds.
As it regards the public service, all experience
shows that the man makes the ' est soldn r who
makes the field his choice The un rsal char
acter of Americans is that of bravery, but the
same person, with all the love of lountiv wlncn
is common to Imencans, (and no country on oai th
rver pre sentí d such clmms, or < vrr commanded
such patriotism,-) would be much more effertiie
in war w lien circumstances maiked the field of
glory as his choice, than when the state of his
affairs at home, oi the distresses of h s depender
fdnnlj , forced upon his mind a painful reluctance
to do w hat, under other circumstances, would be
a matter of choice
The difference between a tour of three months
and a yeai 's service, of the same persons, is so
decidedly in favor of the latter, both in efficiency
and economy, that it must forcibly strike the
mind of every person upon a moment's reflection.
Persons in public service but three months, will
scaicely have learned the use of arms, the exer-
cises of the field, and the discipline of the army
before their term will expire Experience is as
necessary to the efficiency of an army as to any
other employment, and it is a fact as well estab-
lished as any other principle in mihtaiy annals,
that troops disciplined and experienced are, in
action, nearly equal to double their numbers of
untutored novices, espei mlly when to knowl-
edge and experience is added the ardor of voli-
tion Our western frontier, on the extreme con-
fines of Missouri and Arkansas, is at this moment
threatened with Indian hostilities While we are
here deliberating, the tomahawk is preparing and
the scalping-krnfe sharpening, and before the ap-
pearance of a sufficient force to subdue, by terror,
the martial spmt of the savages, there is danger
of the reaction of the Black Hawk and the Floi ida
scenes in those western regions I am unwilling
to cause an hour's delay, but if ordinary militia
drafts are made, which cannot exceed three
months, at least half that time must be occupied
in going and returning, so that for three months'
pay, the country will not have more than six
weeks field and camp service By the time they
reach the scene of action, new levies must be made
to relieve them, so that at least double the number
of men must be in motion, and in pay, to keep
the same number in the field, and these of new
troops, instead of those who are accustomed to
the service The expense of outfits, whethenn-
curred by the public or by indiv lduals, is so much
actual expense to the country, and this must be
renewed as often as new levies are made, so that
in point of economy, there is a difference of more
than one half in favor of volunteers for a year,
as well as double the efficacy in their service
The saving of life is also a desideratum worthy
of notice The loss by sickness and mortality-
brought on by the change of life from the enjoy-
ment of home to the privations and hardships
incident to the camp, is believed to be greater
than by the strife of battle, and this loss is prin-
cipally among those who are commencing the
service. After an experience of three months,
men become habituated to the soldier's life, and
generally enjoy as good health as in private life.
We have a sufficient numbei of patriotic citizens
in the morning and vigor of life, who are willing
to indulge the patriotic ardor which they have
derived fiom their revolutionary fathers by the
performance of this service, and surely no army
is so virtuous and patriotic, no force so efficient,
as volunteer citizens, after they have learned the
duties of service They never assume a mercen-
ai y character They retain all the moral senti-
ments of citizens, expecting to return to civil life,
and in their return, they bring with them into
civil life all the honorable and liberal sentiments
of Anicncan soldiers
The bill does not propose, as some gentle-
men seem to suppose, giving to the Piesident ex-
traordinary power The Constitution gives him
the power, as commander-in-chief, to call into
Service the militia for the same purposes contem-
plated in the bill The existing law recognizes
this power, but it limits the service of the same
persons to three months, when he may supersede
them by others The present bill prov ides that
instead of changing them, he may continue the
srme persons by their own consent, and that, in-
stead of drafts, he may receive such as volunteer
