CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
derlv and respectful manner to the Speaker and to
the House He was endeavoring to explam that
if th  committee intended to make such a repott, it
was due 10 the gentleman implicated that be should
be permitted to expla'n the ground on which he ob-
jected, which was simply this- that the consent
rule, under which the commi tee was acting, opei-
ated beneficially when operating equal'y, and that
the North and the South should alike participate
in its benefits; but that it operated unequally,
when questions growing out of the peculiar institu-
tions of the South were raised as obstacles to bills
interesting to people of that portion of the Union
This inequality haying been brought about by tie
objtctions of the gentleman from Massachusetts
[Mr Adams] to the bill for the benefit of General
Watson, he did most calmly, deliberately, and re-
spectfully proceed virtually to abolish the consent
ro'e, in order that, by it, one patt tf ¡he country
might not derive benefits from which the other was
excluded.
The objections that he then made were not
through factious motives and through disiexpect,
but with the settled conviction that the rule did not
workequallj, and that a rule that did not work
both ways was not a good rule, and ought to be
abolished. He therefore felt himself bound practi-
cally to tcpeal it. In regard to the at'empt of the
repoiter ot the Intelligencer to connect him du>ad-
vantageoirsly with what he >vas piea^cd to term a
row, he would call on the gentlemen who stood op-
posed to him on tins floor to say whether, since he
first took his seat in the ha'l, lie bad not been Ihe
uniform advt cate of order, and whether he had not
always su"tain<d the Chair in pieservmgn, whether
he had ever been the par ícipant m any row, unless
it could be said that a cor uetitious discharge of
his duty could be called so. If that could be called
partaking in a row, then the gentltman from Mas-
sachusetts, for objecting to the bill for the iclief of
Genera! Watson, was also guilty of engaging in a
rjw. The gentleman, no doubt, did ihis in the
conscientious discharge of his duty, and though he
appealed to him for permission to make a brief ex-
planation, which he thought would have lemoved
his objections, and though the gentleman from Ten-
nessee [Mr CariitheksJ made the same ?ppeal, yet
he periinaci usly refused to allow one word of ex-
plana ion to be made. Seeing, ihen, that the rights
of one of hi constituents, were thus thrown away,
the interests of his section of the country dtspi«ed,
and the rule under which they wee acting .tndeied
uneqiial m ¡Is opera ion, he felt it to be his duly to
put an end to it in the on'y way in his power—and
that was, by objecting to every bill as it should
come up
So much for the row that it was thus sought to
connect him with, ard he would observe, in pac-
ing, that if ever he got in o a row m that House, it
would be a very -llent oik on his part, what he
would do would be out ot doors Now, as to Ihe
other part of the rcpoit, m which the reporter
sought to convict him ot a denial of what was
true Here wat the report of the Intelligencer,
which he would send to the Chair to be lead, m or-
der that the Ilocise might see how defectiv-, how
unfair, an I how devoid of truih, it was Mr C

When a name or two had been called, further proceedings
were suspended
The Chairman resumed his seat in committee
And to every bill, as its title was read,
Mr M A Cooper rose and objected, [or, rather m many in-
stances, he had not time to take his seat, but, retaining the floor,
objected 'n masse to every thing ]
The Chairman at last brought upa bill in relation to the
GEORGIA MILITIA
The title of the bill is as follows 'A bill for the payment of
seven companies of Georgia militia for services rendered in the
years 1840 and 1841 >                                      ,..,.,
Mi M A Cooper, as the reporter distinctly understood,
objected
Mr James objected, tas did, also, other members ]
Alter a brief conversation—
Mr James said, I withdraw my objection
Mr M A Cooper    Then I withdrew my objection
Mi Andrews of Kentucky renewed it
The same scene was enacted until the calendar was gone
through with—
Mr M A Cooper successively objecting to every bill as its
title was read
Mr Everett thereupon moved that the committee rise, with
a view, he said, of moving that the House íesolve itself Into
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
Mr BRiaoa moved to amend the motion by adding,' and that
the committee also state the reason why it was not able to take
up any other bill'
The amendment was agreed to by an apparent acclamation
The committee then rose and the Chairman reported action
on the said several bills before referred to And also said that
he was specially Instructed to repoit that the committee had
taken up the private calendar, and gone over it but that, in con
sequence of objections interposed by a gentleman fiom Geor
gid, they had been unable to transact any husmeos
A sort of row followed, involving many points of ordei, the
truth of thf Chairman's report, and especially the truth of the
fact as to objection having been made by Mr M A Cooper to
the Georgia imhtia bill—that gentleman denying that he had
objected Aftei a good deal of trouble, and the bpeaker hav
ing decided that the matters of fact would he a proper subject
ofquesliin, if objected to, when they should appear on the
journal
The House resolved itself into Committee of theWho'e on
the state of the Union and (the tariff bill having been laid aside
foi the day) proceeded to the consideration of Ac
N«w, the House would observe that it was re-
ported hore that, in the first place, the "reporter
distinctly understood" that Mr. M A Cooper ob-
jected to the bill providing for the Georgia claims,
when it was cal'ed, «econdly, that when a con-
troversy aro«e as to the truth of the fact that ob
jection was mads by the gentleman from Georgia
to the Georgia taihtia bill, ihat g'n leman denied
that he had objec ed Now, (said Mr C ,) this
part of the report is wholly untrue He would
staie what occurred, and every gentleman v ould
be satisfied that he was correct in what he said.
When this mat'er was first started by the gentle-
man from Massachusetts t > the bill cf Gen Wat-
'on, he declared that he would object to all bibs as
they might come up, and in this way he might be
said to h ve objected to the Georgia mtutia bi'l;
but be himself d d not understand this declaration
to inclu le that bill, for «ime gentltmen raised the
point of order that objections could not be mide in
the mas'.; and he accordingly assented, and object-
ed to eacb bill separately Furthermore, the point
ot order wai raised that he could not make his ob-
jections from his seat, and therefore, to gratify tho^e
who riised this objection, he rose from his «eat on
eafh occasion While proceeding in this way
with bis printed calendar before him, his ear
caught the sound of the Georgia claim Some lit-
tle pjeasmtry was occasiontd by this ainomce
ment. Some gentlemen thought ihdt he had
got him«elf uto a serious difficulty, and dare not
meet the ques ion, and, at ihe same lime, that there
was no way oi hi. getting out of it He then sail,
"Read that again, Mr Chairman " He want d it
r-aH, that he might know wnat cHim it vas, and,
S"Condly, he wished to give gentlemen around him
an opportunity ot objecting Befo'p the Chairman,
however,*cnukl read it a "ecopd tjrre, the fsn Ie-

thouqbt that he had objected, rose and said • " I
withdraw my objection also " This was done tj
remove the impressions existing m the mind of any
one that any objection had been made on his part.
Th's being the state of the facts, the reporter who
had misrepresent him was bound m justice to
correct his report Notwithstanding Gen Wat-
son's case had been first objected to by the gentle-
man from Massachusetts; notwithstanding both he
and the genileman from Tennessee appealed to
him and the House for liberty to make a brief ex-
planation; and notwi'hstanding various objections
were made, and he was not permitted to explain,
the reporter omitted it all To say the least of it,
the report was one that the reporter ought to blush at
What made this case more peculiar was, that on a
former occasion, when he made some remarks, he
went to this same reporter, whom he now saw sit-
ting at his desk, and asked him to show him what
he had reported of his remarks. The answer was,
" We don'i report you " Now, he thought that re-
porters were permitted to have seats here to report,
impartially, the proceedings of the House, and not
to give one-sided, incorrect versions of them ; and
he also thought that, as this reporter had refused
to report him for the purpose of doing him justice,
he should have refrained from reposing him for the
purpose of doing hirn njustice.
Mr C. said, that if the people of Georgia, and
the effect that this report might have on him, had
been alone concerned, he would not have taken the
trouble to notice this poor, pitiful attempt to make
political capital out of bim. The people of Geor-
gia knew hira well. In all the political controver-
sies of the State, he had taken a part. His track
was known everywhere, and the people of Geor-
gia knew what to expect of him He could not,
therefore, be injured in their estimation in this way.
But he desired to stand well in the opinion of hu
fellow-members, and of the public ai large ; and
tor this reason he had risen to correct the Intelligen-
cer's report.
With regard to the report of the chairman of the
Commi'tee of the Whole, he must say that it did
him great injustice. The chairman made that re-
port without authority of the committee, and in
spite of his persevering inquiry, which he was in
courtesy bound to answer, he maintained his seat
in silence, and made that report, which he would
venture to assert there were not ten men in the
House who would justify it It must be remarked,
too, that when the report of the chairman was chal-
lenged by the genileman from Massachusetts, at a
prev ous stage of the proceedings, he acknowleged
thst it was not correct, withdrew it, and substituted
another.
Mr. BLACK ro>e fur the purpose of correcting
the journal so as to make it conform to the Jacts
s ated by his colleague, i e that the objection to
the bill for ihe relief of Mr Watson was first raised
by the gsntleman from Massachnsett ; after which,
his colleague made his objections to the subsequent
bills, and further (6 s'ate the fact that his colleague
objee'ed to every case called up, with Ihe exception
of the bill providing for the claims of the State of Geor-
gia, which his colleague did not object to. The
report of ihe chairman of the Committee of the
Whole stated that "he was specially instructed by
the commitlee-to report ihat it had gone through
with the private calendar, but that, owing to ob-
jections raised by the gentleman from Georgia to
every bill that came up, they were unab e to do
any busmen " He wished the journal to be cor-
rected in these partícula s.
Mr ADAMS denied that he had objected to the
claim tor the relief of General Watson When
'he bi'l camp up, he bad moved to strike out the
enaoung clause, an*' then the chairman decided
that ihe bill  must lie oter.
M-. BLACK ín'is'ed that the gentleman from
Mas-achusetis dil object to ihatb'U.
The SPEAKER «aid that both of the gen iemen

t email fro n Ge ig a, it ctuld m t be entertained,
