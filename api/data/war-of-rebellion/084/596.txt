reports that Thrailkill is concentrating a force near Smithville, in Clay County, with the avowed purpose of again making a raid on Platte City, and of the truth of the report I have no doubt. I shall take measures to afford the major all the aid I can spare from my command when needed. I will at once send over and break up his camp if it can be found.

H. HILLIARD,

Major, Commanding Post.

SAINT JOSEPH, August 7, 1864.

Major H. HILLIARD,

Weston, Mo.:

I am, glad to hear your boys are making such a good beginning. The Weston militia will soon be in working order, and then you will have an opportunity of sending out co-operating scouts. Kill the rascals is the word. Tell Major Cranor that we want no prisoners except such as come into his camp and surrender.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT JAMES, MO., August 7, 1864.

Brigadier General O. GUITAR, Rolla:

An effort is to be made to convey a large lot of goods from here to-night to Colonel Hull (rebel), whose locality we learned to-day. I left the lieutenant to attend to the colonel. I have just arrived here with ten men to prevent the moving of the goods. Send an officer here by daylight to search the place. If you wish we will try all in the lines.

J. W. BOYD.

ROLLA, August 7, 1864.

J. W. BOYD,

Saint James:

I will send an officer in the morning; keep things quiet until he comes. Let me know where Hull is how many men he has, and what he is doing.

O. GUITAR.

Brigadier-General

WARRENSBURG, MO., August 7, 1864.

Colonel JAMES McFERRAN,

Lexington:

Information just received from Chapel Hill that guerrillas were in force north of that place on 4th instant and left, probably intending a raid east. Convey this information to Lieutenant-Colonel Lazear and look out for them.

By order:

J. H. STEGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
