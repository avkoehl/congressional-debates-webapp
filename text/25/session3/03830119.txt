ber of points, and for larger amounts, than any-
other banking institution in the country
The money to be realized as the proceeds of
this draft would be as valuable at Philadelphia
as at any point in the country, and more valuable
than at any other points except New York and
Boston, and for disbursements in the South and
Southwest, it would be even more valuable at
Philadelphia than at the latter place. There were
no general deposit banks holding public money
under the deposit law of 1836, to which the pro-
ceeds of this draft could have been transfeired
without depieciating the funds and placing them
more inconveniently foi public use By what
obligation of duty, then, was the Secretary of the
Treasury called upon to transfer this amount at
all, for the mere purpose of safe keeping? Will
it be pretended that the money was unsafe in the
Pennsylvania bank' I presume not Little as
is my confidence in the institution, in any sense,
it is not yet so perfectly impaired as to enable me
to believe that this money is not secure, for the
short time it may remain in its vaults, before it
is called out foi the use of the public creditors
I cannot as yet, by my public acts,express such
an opinion of this bank Why, then, I again
ask, was the Senetary to withdraw the money
from that restmgplace but for pui poses of public
disbursement* That bank was, at the time, a
depository of public money, of a special charac-
ter, and for a temporary pui pose and pei loci, but
it was making disbursements, and meeting the
drafts of the Treasurer, and was therefore a con
venient location, so fat as the public seivice was
concerned, for this money If the Secretary had
transferred it, he must eithei have placed it in
some other bank which was also a depositoiy of
a special character, holding the trust, like this
bank, by the selection and at the pleasuie of the
Secretary, and not under the law of 1836, or to a
general deposit bank inconveniently located, and
where the money would be less valuable Was
it his duty to do eithei'- and if so, upon what
ground' Not to secure the safety of tht funds,
because they were as safe where they were as in
anyplace it was in his powei to place them Not
to make the money more valuable, because it was
at a point were it was as valuable for public dis-
bursement as any point which the country pre-
sented Nottopiomote the convenience of the
public service, because that convenience was best
consulted by leaving the money where it was
He did not put the money in this bank It was
to be paid to the Treasurer theie, it was paid to
the Tieasuier theie, and theie the Secretaiy of
the Tieasury, acting through his chief cleik, Mr
Young, left it m safe keeping until the wants of
the Tieasui y should call it thence This is his
fault, if fault he ha  committed
Was he, then, bound to tiansfcr this money
merely to show his hostility against this paitic-
ular banking institution > If transferred at all, it
must have been transferred to some other bank
for neither the laws of Congress noi the practice
of the Department authouzed the Secretaiy to
transfer the pioceeds of this draft to any public
officer of the country, simply for the puipose of
safe keeping Was the Secretary of the Treasury,
then, bound to transfci those funds to a general de-
posit bank, where their v ilue to the public would
be diminished, or to some othei special deposit
bank of his own selection, not for any purpose of
public utility, but merely to show the hostility of
himself and his fuends towaids this particular
bank? This is the plain, duect, and simple ques-
tion presented, and this the issue foimed in rela-
tion to this deposit m the Pennsylvania bank
It may be, Mr President, that blame to the
Secretary of the Treasury, and blame to other
executive officers of the country, should proceed
from this tiansaction It is not my province,
nor is it my desue, to pronounce the judgment
which the Senate or the people will form ° It is
enough for me that I have exhibited the ficts
fully, and presented these consequences, which
weie unavoidable, in any couise the Secretary
might have chosen to take That bem"- done, I
leave the matter to this body and the°country,
with a íespeotful confidence that the motives of
that officer will be spared, in any event, who has
had the magnanimity to sacufice his peisonal
feelings, and strong hostilities, to the profit and
convenience of that blanch of the public service
commuted to his charge.
I now pass, sir, to a very different branch of
the facts ptesented in the case befoie us I refer
to the published letter of Mr Biddle, the Presi-
dent of the Pennsylvania bank, which has been
adduced to the Senate as evidence of the improper
connection between the Government and his bank
The paragiaph of that letter to which I paiticu-
laily allude is in the following words
" In the month of July, the Government agreed to receive
an anticipated payment or the bonds of the bank to the
amount of between four and five million dollars, m a credit
to the Treasurer on the book  of the bank, and arrange
ments were made lor the more distant public disbursements
in tile notes of the bank These arrangements, a  bun r
able to the executive ofiVers as they were beneficial to the
public service broiigh  tli" Government into efficient co
operation for the reestabh&hment of the currency, and
opened the way to a resumption of specie payments The
resumption accordingly to ik place throughout the middle
States on the 13th of August, and in many of the southern
and western States soon after "
If I have been at all successful in my exertions
hitherto, the Senate now fully understands the
whole affair of the " anticipated payment of the
bonds,"and is able cleaily to judge how far this
buef and easy mention of a compliance, on the
part of the officers of the Government, with the
repeated and untiring solicitations of this bank to
arrange the payment of one of these bonds, part-
ly by anticipation, and.to sell another of them to
the institution, fiom an utter inability to find an-
other pmchaser )n the markets of the whole
woild, makes a true repiesentation of the facts
of the case to the mind of the reader     How far
would the public, to whom this letter is given by its
author, be likely to be impressed with the truth,
from this assumed icpresentation of it? An agree
ment to make payment in a " special deposit" to
the credit of the Tieasnrer, is converted into an
agieement to anticipate the payment of the bonds
" in a credit to thcTreasuier on the books of the
bank " while the ceitificate of the bank, of the
special deposit, is a mattei of record in the Tieas
my  Depaitment     An  agieement to pay "in
specie or its equivalent," an invariable qualification
to all the stipulations, is convened  into  " ar
rangements" " for the more distant public dis
bursements m the notes of the bank "   This is
the evidence from  this source, and such  is the
witness upon whose testimony before the coun-
try, voluntarily given, our highest executive offi-
cers are to be condemned unheard     How far
this witness is supported by the facts, I most
cheeifully leave the Senate to determine, but I
must, on behalf of the officers concerned, protest
agiinst the compliment so confidently and so in
pmously forced upon them by the President of
the bank     They may bear the hostility of this
institution, but they cannot bear its praise, and I
most certainly not when that praise is shaped, as I
it is in this part of the letter fiom which I have I
read, to suit the views of a malignant opponent   I
To give to the water of the letter, howevei, all j
the foundation which possibly can be claimed for j
his statement of the facts, I will detain the Senate
to make a few references to anothei document  I
refer to the message of the Piesident of the 9th
instant, m answer to a call fiom the Senate for
all orders and ins ructions issued by he ids of Do
partments, heads of bureaus, and the Postmastei
Geneial, íelative to the kind of money and bank
notes which might be paid out on account of the
United States, since the 14th day of Apnl, 1836
The message communicates answers to the call
from all the heads of all the Depaitment , and
bureaus who have issued any such order;  or in
structions within the period mentioned, but the i
present purpose does not require that I should i
refer to any other than those from the Secictaiy
of War and the heads of bureaus in that Depart
ment     These refeiences shall be as brief as the
occasion will permit, and it is heie also my in
tention to let these officers speak, principally, for
themselves
The Secietary of War, m submitting to the
President the answers to the call fiom his Depait- i
ment, says                                                                    |
" In submitting the e reports, it is proper to remark that
the circulars from the p iv, quartermaster «, engineer and
Indian departments   m October were issued at a pen id i
which required the exercise of ¡,reat forbearance and dis
ere ion m the management ot the fiscal opri itious oi tins
D partment, in order to avoid as far as pi actio ililo cmbir
lassing the money concerns of the country    I had b en
informed, from credible sources, that a rigid evactm ot
specie, to meet all our disbursemen s m the South and j
West, would retard the resumption of specie payme Us, em   i
barrass the operations of tliose banks that bad resumed, and ]
prove senoisly prejudicial to the interests o<" commerce m
that portion of the country
' Influenced by these impressions and acting under these
views, winch I lud urged upon aU branch s ot the Depart
ment, these circulars were issued, and in so nc re jicds est
ceed aliat u-as mtendel and upon being brought to fie no
tice of the present chiefs of bureaus, they have modified
them so as to render the instructions more strictly and dis
tmetly conformable to existing enactments At the same
time, it must be borne in mind that the Bank of the timted
btates Was, at the period of issuing tne circulars a specie
pa} in  bank, and that to have exacted specie trom (lie
banks in the boisth and West which were n debted to tint
institution or in winch it had deposited tunds to meet the
drafts of the 1 reasury for «ar wanants, would not only
have been of no aid to the public service, but would have
inflicted injury alone upon those banks and been prejudicial
onl / io the trade offic South and rVest "
Here we have the views of the Secretary, and
the motives and policy by which he intended to
be governed, m the administration of the affairs
of his Department The time was one of gieat
difficulty. The banks of the North and middle
States had resumed specie payments, and those
of the South and West were struggling to reach
that desirable point The disbursements of his
Department were to be principally made in the
South and West and the drafts of the Treasurer
for that purpose weie, by the arrangement with
the Bank of the United States in lelation to the
payment of two of its bonds, to be met, to much
the greatest extent, by that institution The sup-
position of the Secretary was natural and neces-
sary that those diafts would be met by calls upon
its debtor banks in those sections of the Union
wheie the payments were to be made, and by
deposits of funds in the banks there Hence his
piopcr and laudable anxiety, so far as an observ
anee of the law, and of the unquestioned rights of
the public rreditois would peimit, to make those
heavy disbursements in a maimer the least inju-
rious to the banking institutions, the trade and
commeice, and the business generally of those
sections, and so as, in the leasi possible degree, to
" retaid the resumption of specie payments" m
the South and West, and hence, too, he urged
these views and this policy " udoii all the
branches of the Depattment " Still he tells us
that the orders and instructions issued by some of
the heads of bureaus in the D partmt nt, " in
some respects exceed whit was intended "
Satisfied that the motives of the Secretaiy, as
avowed by himseK, must be universally approved,
and that the policy he adopted for the government
of his Department was proper and ught so far
as it was wisely pursued and properly carried out,
I now proceed to refu to such of these " oidtrs
and mstiuctions" as, if any, mu t be considered
exceptionable The first, in the order of time, 13
a direction given by the feeeretaiy himself in re-
lation to the payment of pensioners The date
of this circulai is May, 1837, the month in which
all the banks of thecouiitry,compaiativcIy speak-
ing, suspended specie payments,, and is in the fol-
lowing language
