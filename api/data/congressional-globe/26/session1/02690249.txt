From Major Chambn, the commander at this fort, who was
first informed ofthe object and cause ol the inquiries, and from
his officers, the following facts were ascertained That he was
there stationed by the Government of the Cañadas, having, un-
der bis command, one compai y ol grenadier soldiers, number
ing abont eighty five men, of the 11th regiment, and one light
company, the third of same regiment, numbering about ninely
men; in all one hundred and seventy five, not including officers
commissioned, or servants The names of 'heofliairs are Maj
Chambo, Ciptl Wallmgton Lieuts Bloss and Gould, and Ensign
Tolun That the barracks were commenced last spring, and
some of the buiJdmgsare still unfinished That the first soldiers
were stationed herein June last, comprising a sergeant, cor-
poral, and ten men of24tfi reglment, and in November following
■aid company of grenadiers were ordered to take their place,
and that about the first of January last they were reinforced by
said third company That the road from these barracks, to the
river Des Loup, has been made and repaired the past season,
distance about thirty-six miles
In addition, the undersigned ascertained that the English have
built, at Lake Temiscouata, a number of large flatbotiom boats,
and also keel boats, each of which will serve to carry fifty men,
and the fiat bottom boats would transport, safely, heavy ord
nance.   Outside the defences the English have a boat aud store
The works at this fort are calculated to be a sure defence
against artillery and ¡i£« arms, as will more fully appear from
plan annexed.
All of which is moat respectfully submitted

Mr. Forsyth to Mr Fox
Department of State,
Washington, March 6,1840
By the directions of the President, the undersigned, Secre
tary of State of the United States, communicates to Mr Fox,
Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Great
Britain, the enclosed copy of a report made to the Governor of
the State of Maine, by the agent, commissioned on the part of
the authorities of that State, to ascertain the precise character
and extent of the occupation of parts of the disputed territory
by troops of her Britannic Majesty, and of the buildings and
other public works constructed for their use and accommo
datum
By that report, and the three depositions which the under
signed informally communicated to Mr Fox a few days since,
he will perceive that there must be some extraordinary mis
apprehension on his part of the facts in relation to the occupa
uon by British troops of poruonsof the disputed territory The
statements contained in these documents, and that given by Mr
Fox, m his note of the 20th of January last, exhibit a striking
discrepancy as to the number of troops now in the territory,
as compared with those who were in it when the arrangement
between G overnor Fairfield and Lieutenant Governor Harvey
was agreed upon, and also as to the present and former state
ef the buildings there The extensive accommodations pre
pared and preparing, at an old and at new stations, the works
finished, ana in the course of construction, on the land and on
the water, are not in harmony with the assurance the only object
is the preservation of a few unimportant buildings and store
houses tor the temporary piotecuon of the number of troops
herMaiesty's ordinary service can require to pass on the road
from New Brunswick to Canada
The undersigned will abstain from any remarks upon these
contradictory statements, until Mr Fox shall have had an op
portunity to obtain the means of fully explaining them How
essential it is, that this should be promptly done, and that the
steps necessary to a faithful observance rn the part of her Ma
jesty's colonial authorities of the existing agreements between
the two Governmerts should be immediately taken, Mr Fox
cannot fail fully to understand
The undersigned avails himself of the occasion ti renew to
Mr. Fox assurances of his high consideration.
JOHN FORSYTH.
Mr Fox to Mr Forsyth
Wasshington, March 7,1840
The undersigned, her Britannic Majesty'sEnvoy Extraordi
nary and Minister Plenipotentiary, has the honor taackiiow
ledge the receipt of the official note ol yesterday's date, ad-
dressed to him by Mr Torsyth, Secretary of State of the United
States, to which is annexed the copv of a report from Mr Ben
jamin Wiggin, an agent employed by the State of Maine to
visit the British military post at Lake Temiscouta, and in which
reference is made to other papers upon the same subject, which
were informally communicated to the undersigned by Mr For
syth a few days before, and the attention of the undersigned is
called by Mr Forsyth to different points upon which the mfor-
mauon contained in the said papers is considered to be mate-
rially at variance with that which was conveyed to the United
States Government by the undersigned in his official note of the
26th oflast January
The undersigned had already been made acquainted, by the
Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick, with the cireum
stance of Mr. Wiggin's visit to the military post at Lake Te
mucoata, where the officer in command very properly fur
nished to Mr Wiggin the requisite information upon all mat
ters connected with the British station, which he appeared de-
sirous to inquire about.
Thealle'ed points of variance, after deducting what is fanci
ful and coijectural in the reports now produced, and after com
paring what is there stated in contradiction to other reports be
Ore produced from the same quarters, do not appear to the un-
dersigned to be by any means so matenai as they seem to have
bsen considered by the Government of the United States    The
British military detachment  stationed at Lake Temiscouta,
which the agents employed by the State of Maine had, in the
first  instance, with  singular exaggeration, represented as
amounting   to  two   regiments,   a   now   discovered    by
the    same   pirties   to   amount   to   one   hundred   and
«eventyfive men, which, instead of two regiments, is some
thing less than two companies   It is indeed true, should such a
POHU be í jnsiderei worth discussing, that the undersigned
might have used a more technically correct expression in his
note of the 26th of January, i f he had stated the detachment in
question to consist of from one to two companies, instead of
stating it to consist of one company But a detachment oí her
Majesty's troops has been stationed at the lake Temiscouata,
fiom time to time, ever since the winter of 1837 and 'S3, when
the necessity arose from marching reinforcements by that route
from New Btunswick to Cana la, and it will be remembered
that a temporary right of using that route for the same pur
pose, was expiessly reeervedfto Great Britain in the piovisional
agreement entered into at the beginning of last year
It is not therefore true that the stationing a military force at
the lake Temiscouta is a new measure on the part of her Ma-
jesty's authorities Neither is it truo that that measuie has
been adopted for other purposes than to maintain the security
of the customary line of communication, and to protect the
bmldines, stores, and accommodations provided for the use of
Her Maiesty's troops when on a march by that route, and it was
with a view to correct misapprehensions which appeared to
exist upon these points, and thus to do away with one needless
occasion of dispute, that the undersigned conveyed to the Uni
ted States Government the information contained in his note of
the 26th of Jamnry
With regard again to the construction of barracks and other
buildings, and the preserving them in an efficient state of re-
pair and defence, a similar degree of error and misapprehen-
sion appears still to prevail in the mmds.of the American au-
thorities
The erection of those buildings within the portion ofthe dis-
puted territory now referred to, for the shelter of her Majesty's
troops while on their march, and for the safe lodgment of the
stores, is no new act on the part of her Majesty's authorities
The buildings in question have been in the course of construe
Uon from a period antecedent to the provision agreements of
last year, and they are now maintained and occu pied along the
line of march, with a view to the same ob)ects above specified,
for which the small detachments of troops also referred to, are
m like manner there stationed
The undersigned will not refrain from here remarking upon
one point of comparison exhibited in the present controversy.
It is admitted by the United Sutes authorities that the armed
bands stationed by the Government of Maine in the neighbor-
hood ofthe Aroostook river, have fortified those stations with
artillery, and it is no « objected as matter of complaint against
the BntiNh authorities, with reference to the buildings at Lake
Temiscouata,notthat thosebuildmgs are furnishedvvith artillery,
but only that they are defended by palisades capable of resist
ing artillery It would be difficult to adduce stronger evidence
ofthe acts on the one ride being those of aggression, and on the
other of defence
The fart, shortly, is, and this is the assential point of the argu-
ment, that her Majesty's authorities have not as yet altered their
state of preparation, or strengthened their military means
within the disputed territory, with a view to settlin  the ques
Uon ofthe boundary, altheush the attitude assumed by the
State of Maine with reference to that question, would be a clear
justification of such measures, and it is much to be appre-
hended that the adop'ion of such measures will sooner or later
become indispensable, if the people of Maine be not compelled
to desist from the extensive system of armed aggression which
they are continuing to carry on in other parts of the same dis-
puted territory
The undersigned avails himself of this occasion to renew the
Secretary of Stale of the United States the assurance of his dis-
tinguished consideration
H S  FOX
The documents having been read
Mr WILLIAMS addressed the Senate in justification of him-
self, as wUl as the Governor of Maine, for having declared that
a portion of that State was occupied by British troops, and that
(he Butish authorities had erected barracks and military
works upon the disputed territory, which statements had been
denied by Mr. Fox's letter to Mr Forsyth of the24th of January
last
Upon the call ofthe Senate, (said Mr W ) the President com
munited the correspondence between this Government and
Great Britain, and also all the correspondence which had been
had since the last session of Congress with the Governor of
Maine and the Butish Minister at Washington, relative to the
Northeastern boundary, and the jurisdiction ofthe disputed ter
ritorr This was done on the 22d of January last, and em-
braced the able and significant reply ol Mr Forsyth of the
16th of January, to the note of Mr Tox of the 12th of January
last, declaring "that a persistence in, or a repetition of, such
arts, oa the part of her Majesty's agenis, as those now com
plained of, would, if avowed by Great Britain, be considered as
but little in accordance with those (Mr Fox's amicable) assu
ranees "
The message and documents were immediately printed and
widely circulated throughout the country, producing a deep
sensation on tbe public mma On the 24th of January, Mr
Fox addressed another note to Mr Forsyth, saying, among other
things, that "since the date of his last official note of the 12th
instant, he has been furnished by her Majesty's authorities in
North America with more corrsct information than he then pos
sessed, respecting certain reported movements of British troops
within the disputed territory, <fcc " and adding, that "it appears
from accurate information now in the possession of the under-
signed, that the Governor of Maine, and, through him, the
President and General Government of the United States, have
been misinformed as to the facts In the first place, no rein
forcement has been marched to the British post at the Lake
Temiscouata, the only change occurring there has been the re
Jiefof a detachment of her Majesty's 24th regiment by a de
tachment of equal forceof the llth regiment, this force of one
company being now stationed at the Temiscouata post, as it
always has been, for the necessary purpose of protecting the
stores and accommodations provided for the use of her Majes-
ty's troops who may be required, as heretofore, to march by
that route to and from the provinces of Canada and|New Bruns
wick In the second place, it is not true that the British autho
nties either have built, o are building, barracks on both sides
ihe St Johns r Ver, or at the mouth of the Madawaska river, no
new barracks have in fact been built any where," &c to which
Mr Forsyth replied on the 28th of ¡January, and on the29th of
that month, the President transmitted both letters, with his
message, to the Senate, which were printed and extensively
circulated through the country You may well suppose, said
Mr W with what astonishment I listened to such assertions
from   Ihe official organ of her Britannic  Majesty!   aj
though perfectly satisfied that the statements of Governor
Fairfield were substantially correct, I could not but be
sensible that the letter of Mr Fox was well calculated to
throw suspicion on those statements, and to create a belief that
Governor Fairfield had mistaken and misrepresented the true
state of the case I regret that he has been obliged to lay un-
der this imputation so long, but am now rejoiced that the Presi-
dent has done justice to the Governor of Maine, as well as to the
nation, by voluntanly communicaung the evidence which has
been furnished to him, and which has now been read to the
Senate, fully establishing, as it does, the correctness of the
statements made by Governor Fairfield, and showing the enure
want of accuracy in the allegations in the Uritish Mimstei's
note of the 24th of January Let us see what Mr Fox de
Clares, in that noto, "appears from the accurate information
then in his possession " In the first place, (said Mr W ) he
asserts "that no reinforcement has been marched to the Lake
Temiscouata " The evidence is, that the 3d light company of
10th regiment, numbering ninely men, was marched to that
post about the first of January last, as a reinforcement to the
grenadiers then there In the second place, Mr Fox says,
"the only change occurring there has been the relief of a de
tachment of her Majesty's ¿4th regiment by a detachment of
equal force ofthe llth regiment " The evidence is, that, in
November last, there was at that post a sergeant, corporal,
and ten men only, who were then relieved by a company of
grenadiers of llth regiment, consisting of eighty Jive
nun In the third place, Mr Fox states "that this
force, of one company, being now stationed at the
Temiscouata post, as it always has been," &c The evidence
is, that, prior to June last, there was no force there, and, until
November, there was only a sergeant's guard In the fourth
place, Mr Fox says "that it is not true, that the British autho
nties either have built or are building barracks on both sides
ofthe St Johns river, or at the mouth of the Madawaska river "
The evidence is, that barracks, and other strong works, have
been built at the foot and head of the lake on the raorf A side of
the St Johns river, and that a large building of hewn timber on
the south side of that river, and opposite the Madaioaska river,
has been hired, fi'ted up for barracks, and is now occupied by
the British authorities for that purpose In the fifth place,
Mr Fox asserts "that no new barracks have, in fact, been built
any where " The evidence is, that nao barracks have been
built at the head and foot of the lakes.
But enough of this The depositions of witnesses undrr oath,
and the report of the agent sent by the authorities of Maine, for
the special purpose of seeing the works and ascertaining the
force of the British upen the disputed territory, will carry coa-
viction to the mind of every one who will read them, and the
nation will see and duly estimate the truth of the case.
Having said (continued Mr W ) what I considered to be my
duty to Governor Fairfield, the State of Maine, and myself, la
reference to this extraordinary letter of the British Minister, I
would now ask the attention ofthe Senate to a more important
view of Ihe subject By the arrangement entered into in March-
last between the Governor of Maine and the Lieutenant Go-
vernor of New Brunswick, it was agreed that the Lieutenant
Governorof New Brunswick, without renewed instructions to
that effect, would not seek to take military possession of the
disputed territory, &c In answer to Governor Fairfield's in
quiry in December last, as to British troops being stationed
within the diputed territory, Sir John Harvey says, " that what-
ever movements of troops may have taken place en the side of
Lower Canada, have been made by authority superior to
mine," &c Is it possible that, after making an arrangement
with the Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick for the pre-
servation of peace upon the borders, pending the negotiation
on the subiect of the boundary, we are now to be told that,
while the Lieutenant Governor respects and conforms to his
own arrangement, his superior may and will do as he pleases,
and is to be permitted to construct strong posts and keep what
military force he thinks proper upon the territory in dispute? Are
we quietly to remain in a condition so humiliating; I trust not.
And ytt this is the posiuon in which weare placed, if we accede
to the views taken by Mr Fox in his letter of24th of January last,
where, speaking of her Majesty's authorities in North America,
he says "they will, as at present advised, consult their own
discretion, in adopting tne measures of defence that miy be ren-
dered necessary by the threats of a violent interruption to the
negonatien, which have been used by all parties in Maine," Ac
Here we have the avowal of the accredited Minister of he
Britannic Majesty to this Government, that her Majesty's author
nties in North America, (not the Lieutenant Governor of New
Brunswick, lor he has made an agreement which forbids his
doing it,) assuming, without the least foundation for such as-
sumption, that Maine threatens, or desires, a violent mterrup
uon to the negotiation, will, as at present advised, consult their
oirn discrefion in adopting measures of defence and we have
the proof that, in the exe ciBe of that discretion, those autho-
rities have constructed strong military posts, stationed regular
troops, and made roads for the transportauon if men and mili-
tary stores within the disputed territory, contrary to agree-
ment, and in violation of the just rights of the State of Maine.
Shall we, can we, submit to such usurpation! to such wrongt
If there is a patriotic feeling in the bosom of any American, it
will emphatically respond, no •
Mr W then alluded to the late message of Sir Jehn Harvey
to the Assembly of New Brunswick, in which he expresses
great confidence that, upon the arrival in England ofthe com-
missioners who recently came out to examine the disputed ter
ntory, and upon their report being made to the Ministry at
home, such a proposition would be made for the adjustment of
the question of boundary as would be satisfactory to this Go-
vernment He does not intimate whatthatproposition will be,
or how it tcillbe made satisfactory, but the Assembly thereupon
passed a bill to authorize Governor Harvey to raise a corps of
twelve hundred men whenever it might become necessary Our
whole borders are being surrounded with military posts and fot-
tifications, additional troops are being sent into the provinces!
and soldiers and military works are placed within and upon a
portion of the territory in dispute
With such means upon our borders to render a proposition
satisfactory, who can wonder that Sir John Harvey should feel
gteat confidence that it would prove satisfactory 1 Would it
not, under such circumstances, be wise to place our frontier in
a condition which will enable us to consider and act upon any
proposition which may be made to us with calmness and tree
dom from coercion? Is it not apparent, while this Goverm?e1nc
is resting in securny, relying upon the strong andJ*l~^a~<¡0„„
derations gf Great Britain of its anxiowdeaire to bring the long
