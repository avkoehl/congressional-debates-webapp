the war, and had e< cry motive and disposition to |
sus'am the aJminisuation,aml to vote every aid to
cany on the war Immediately after my arrival,
I had a full conversatrn with Mr Dallas, at his
request I entertained very kind feelings towards
him, and assured him, after he had explained his
plan, that I wojld give it my earl} and favorable
attention At that time I had relectedbut little on
the subject of banking Many of my political
fripnds expressed a desne that I should take a pro-
minent part m its fav or Their extreme anxiety
roused my attention, and being on no committee,
(they had been appointed before my arrival,) I
took up the subject ior a full mvertigation, with
every disposition to give it my suppor. I had not
proceeded far before I was struck w ith the ex-
traordmaiy charactei of the project a bank
of ^50,000,000. whose capital was to consist
auno t exclusively of Government credit in
the shape of s'ock, and not bound to pay
ns debts during the war and foi three years
afterwards, to furnish the Government with loans
to carry on the war' I saw at once that the effect
of the arrangement would be, that Government
would borrow back its own credit, and pay six per
sent per annum fornh?t they had ahead) paid
eight or nine It was impossible ¡or me to give it
my support under any pressure, however great I
felt the d fficulty of my situation, not only in op-
posing the leadiagmeasuie of the administration at
such a crisis, but w hat was far more responsible, to
suggest one of my own, that would afford relief to
the embairassed Treasury I cast my eyes around,
and soon saw that tne Government should use its
own credit directly, without the intervention of a
bank, which 1 proposed to do in the form of Trea-
sury notes, to be issued m the operations of the Go-
vernment, and to be funded in the subscription to
the «stock of the bank r! ira^ury notes wee at
that time, below pai, even «ith baiiK pap°i The
opposition to them was so great, on the putt of the
banks, that they íefu^ed to receive them on depo-
site, or payment, at par w ith their notes, while the
Government, on its part, received and paid away
notes if the banks at par with its own. Such w as
the influence of the banks, and to such dt gradation
did the Government, in its weakness, submit All
this influence 1 had to encounter, with the entire
weight of the administration thiown into the same
scale. I hesitated not I saw the path of duty
clearly, and deteimined to tread it, as sharp an 1
rugged as it was When the bill came up, I moved
my amct dmci t, th  mam fea'uies cf which
were, that, instead of Government s ock alieaJv
issued, the capital of the bank should consist of
funded Trcasuiy notes, and that, instead of a mere
paper machine, it should be a specie pa)mg bank,
so as to be an ally, instead of an opponent, m re-
storing the currency to a sound condition on the
return of peace The=e were, with me, indispensa-
ble conditions. I acco-jipamed my amendment
with a short speech of fi teen or twenty minutes,
and so ovi-ipowering was the force of truth,
that noittithstinding the mflnence of the ad-
ministration, backed by tne money power, and
the Committee of Wajs and Means, which
was unanimous, w th one exception, as J un-
deistood, my amendment prevailed b) ? large
majority, but it in 11 n fai ed—the opposition, the

unfolded, which approached much neniei to cui
views, bit which was sun object onab't in some
features I objected, and required fuither conces-
sions, which weie refused, and was told the ' ill
could be passed w ithout us, at v hich I too'i up m)
hat and b d good nig! '. The bill was ntr duct J
in the Senate, and speedn> passed that boih On
the second reading, I lose and made a fev\ le-
raarks,   m  which I entreated the House to remem-
ber tha' they were about to vote for th° measure
agamst then convict' m, as had been frequently
•expressed, and that m so doing, they acted under a
supposed necessity, which had been created by
those who expee'ed to -profit by the measure I
then reminded them of the danger of acting under
such pressure, and I said that they were so sens ble
of the truth of what I uttered, that if peace should
arrive before the passage of the bill, it would not
receive the support of fifteen members I concluded
by sayme, that I would íes rve what I intended to
say on the question of the passage of the bill, when
I would express my opinion at length, and appeal
to the country Mv obiection  had not gone to the
people, as'nothing that I had said had been reported-
such was my «ohcitude to defeat the bill, without
extending oui divisions bc)ond the walls of th 
House, in the then cnticai condition of tbecountiy

In making the suppos Hon I had not the

making extensive preparations for the ensuing
campaign, and had made a vigorous attack on
New Orlpans, but had just been repelled, but, by a
most remarkable coincidence, an opportunity (as
strange as it may seem) was afforded to test the
truth of what I said Late m the evening of the
day I met Ml Sturges, then a member of Con-
gress fiom Connecticut He said that he had
some informaron which he could not withhold
fn m me, that a treat) of peace had been made,
and that it had actually arrived m New York, and
wou'd be here the next day, so that I would have
an oprortunity of testing the truth of mv predic-
tion He added that hi* Brother, who had a mer-
canti'e house n New York, had forwarded the
information to him bj expiess, and th it he had
iornaidel the nn'iiati n o co mee ed houses ¡n

gre.'t staples in thalqnarei, md that he wished
me to consider the information as confidential I
thanked him for the intelligence, and promised to
keep it to myself The ruinoi, however, got out,
and the next day an attempt w as made to pass
through the bill, but the House was unwilling to
act till it could asceitain whether a treaty had been
made It arrived in the couise of the day, when,
on my motion, it was laid on the table, with less
than fifteen vc c-, against the motion, and I had
the gratification of receiving the thanks o<" m ny

He who does not see that ihe credit system is on
the eve of a great revolution, has formed a very
imperrect conception of the past, and anticipation
of the future What changes it is destined to un-
dergo, and what new form it will ultimately as-
sume, are conceale 1 m the womb of time, and not
given us to foresee But we may perceive m the
present, many of the elements of the existms s>y-
fem which must be expelled, and others which
mus' enter it in its íenewed form.
In looking at the elements at work, I hold it cer-
tain, that in the process there w ill be a *ctal and
firal separation of the credit of Government and
that of individuals, which have been so long
blended The good of s iciety, and the interests of
both, impeuously demand it, and the growing in-
telligence of the age will enforce it It is unfair,
unjust, unequal, contrary to tne spmt of free insti-
tutions, and conuptmg m its consequence* How
far the credit of Government may be used in a
separate form, with safety and convenience, re-
mains to he seen To the extent of its fiscal ac-
tion, limited stnctly to the function of the co'lec-
tion and disbursement of its revenue, and in the
form I have suggested, I am of the impression it
may be both safely and conveniently used, and
with great incidental advantages to the whole
community Beyond that limit I see no safety, and
much danger
What form individual ciedit will assume aftei
the separation, is still more unceitain , but I see
cVa^l) that the existing fetters that restrain it will
be thrown off The credit of an individual is his
piopcrty, md belongs ti him as ruch as his land
and ho ise , to use it as he phases, w 'h ihe smgle
restriction, w iieh js imposed c i all o ,i rights—that
the y aie not to be us d so as to injure others. What
limitations this restriction may impose, time and
experience will show , but whatever they may be,
they ought to assume the character of general
laws, obligatory on all alike, and open to all, and
under the piovisions of which all may be at liberty
to use 'heir ciedit jointly or separately, as freely as
they now use their land and houses, w itheut any
preference by special acfs, in an) form or shape,
to one over another Eveiy thing like monopaly
must ultimately disappear before the process which
