THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 6.
unadulterated goodness of his heart, disarmed
even political opposition of its rancor. Finally,
in all the relations of life, as a father, husband,
brother, friend, citizen, and legislator, he was
blameless That no testimony of respect for his
many virtues may be wanting, I offer forthe adop-
tion of the House the resolutions which I send to
the Chair
Resohed, unanimously, That this House has received
with deep sensibility the annunciation of the death of Hon
William Patterson, a Representative from the State of
New York
Resolved, unanimously, That the memheis of this Home
will testify their respect for the memory of the deceased by
wearing crape on the left arm for thirty days
DEATH OF HON. A. W. BRUYN.
Mr GRAY then rose, and addressed the House
as follows
Mr Speaker, I smcerelyjom m the expression
of sorrow at the decease of ourlate lamented friend
and colleague, whose death we have just heard
announced, and sympathise with his relatives,
and especially his children, who have suffered a
double bereavement, and regret—yes, sir, deeply
regret—that there 13 still yet to be announced
another instance of mortality, which occuned
during the recess of Congress, among the delega
tion from that State, and that, too, fiom the dis-
trict which I have the honoi in ptrt to represent
I allude to the ¡ate Hon Andrew Di, Witt Bruyn,
who, foi a considerable pel iod pnoi to, and during
all the time he served his constituents in this
body, suffered under a combination of diseases
that impaired las usefulness ht 1 e, and finally tei m
mated ins life on the 27th day of July last, at his
residence in Ithaca Aside from the luepaiablc
loss which his family have sustained, the death
of Judge Bruynis regaidedas no ordinary calam
lty to the community to whom he was lntimttely
known, and by whom his salutary influence, both
in public and private life, was felt and appreci
ated In all situations in life he was amiabh and
unpretending, deliberate in forming his opinions,
and inflexible m maintaining them Ht was, in
all respects, an honorable man, justly, and in a
veiy high degiee, enjoying the esteem of all who
knew him, and those who knew him best ic
spectod htm most He wasalawyei of eminence,
distinguished for the clear and compichcnsivi
view he took of all subjects presented tor his. < on
«deration, possessing talents ptculiaily fitting foi
a judicial station, and, after a successful practice
in his piofcssion for many years, he íectived the
appointment of hist judge of the county louit in
the eounty win le he icsided, the duties of which
he dischaiged for sevt ral yeais, tnd until he was
elected to a seat in this body, with distinguished
ability, and when he lisignctl to enter upon his
duties liere, he roroiw d the unanimous and coi
dial approbation of the bai of his eounty, and
those whose pceuhai piovince it was to |oin m
an expression of Ins valuable sei vices in that ca-
pacity Of his course here, it is only nccessaiy
to remark that he acquued a icputation hen ,
which he maintained elsewheie, of a pure, up
right, and honest man
