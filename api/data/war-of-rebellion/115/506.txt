Butler, and that you said you would have to "think of it. " What I have done is entirely without Mr. Butler's knowledge. What he would like would be a trial here in the city of his birth. Conscious of his innocence he will ask no favor from those who imprisoned him. His daughters are both strong Northern women, and they are deeply distressed by their father's imprisonment. One is married to one of the staunchest of our party. As Mr. Butler was arrested by your order and as he is innocent, on your own account, on the Administration's and on his children's the sooner he is released on a proper parole and bonds the better. It will much oblige me.

Yours, truly,

C. H. FISHER.

SEPTEMBER 21, 1861.

Mr. Butler declines taking the oath of allegiance in the belief that he might lose his property in the South. I would let him go if he would promise to remain.
