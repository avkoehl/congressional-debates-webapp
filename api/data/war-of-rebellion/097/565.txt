I have made arrangements with Colonel Tidball about the ordnance. He is to attend to the field guns and ammunition, and I am to take care of the siege ordnance. I have posted guards over all the latter (on both sides of the Appomattox) that could be found, and shall remove it is fast as my means of transportation will allow. Shall see you shortly.

RICHMOND, April 4, 1865.

(Received 12 p.m.)

Bvt. Brigadier General H. L. ABBOT:

There are many heavy guns on the outer lines of the defenses of this place which should be removed at once. Can you furnish a sling-cart or two with sufficient number of mules or horses for the purpose? If you can spare the men also it will be still better.

W. R. KING,

Lieutenant and Acting Chief Engineer.
