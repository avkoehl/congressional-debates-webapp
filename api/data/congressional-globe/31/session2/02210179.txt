thousand; and its general style and appearance do
not comport with the buildings which are erected
in other places for purposes of that kind. They

hundred and twenty miles long, which will be the '
connecting link between those roads which are j
being constructed in the North and South and the ,
East and West, but the resources of that section
of country will not enable them to complete it very
rapidly, and they pray Congress to make a dona- !'
tion of public lands to aid in the construction of'
that road, in consideration mainly that it will con- :
tribute more to the business and convenience of'
other portions of the Union than it will to East i
Tennessee. It was referred to the Committee on ,

REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
Mr. BORLAND, from the Committee on Print-
^ ing, to which was referred the motion to print the
memorial of John Timberlake, asking a modifica-
' tion of the tariff, and the memorial of the City
Council of St. Louis, asking the right of way and
1 a donation of land for the Pacific railroad, reported
1 against printing the same; which was agreed to.
i Also, from the same committee, reported the
following resolution:
Resolved, Thatthe resolution of the Senate, adopted De-
cember 5, 1850, directing "that the President's message
and accompanying documents be printed and bound in two
I parts," &c., be and the same is hereby rescinded as re-
! spects the binding.
! Mr. BORLAND. I will simply remark, that at
the time the resolution was adopted directing the
President's message an4 accompanying documents
to be bound in two volumes, it was supposed that
they would make a I&rger document than the
printer now finds they will make. It is now
found that they will not make a document too
largÂ« for one volume, and hence the committee
have reported this resolution.
The resolution was agreed to.

Mr. HAMLIN submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered by unanimous con-
sent and agreed to;

resolution; which was considered by unanimous
consent and agreed to:

RIVER NAVIGATION.
Mr. UNDERWOOD. The Committee on Com-
merce have reported a bill making some provision
in regard to the navigation of our waters by steam-
boats. I hold in my hand a series of amendments
which I wish to offer to that bill when it comes
up. These amendments are taken from the laws
of Kentucky. They provide a system of regula-
tions which are for the government of boats in
passing each other to avoid collision. I believe
that various western States have legislated upon
this subject, and in their legislation nave adopted
contradictory and repugnant regulations. The
system adopted by Indiana, for instance, gives
particular directions for the passage of boats, and
the system adopted by the State of Kentucky
conflicts with it. It therefore becomes necessary,
in my judgment, that Congress should legislate
upon the subject and adopt a system of regulations
applicable to it. I therefore desire to submit these
amendments, which are taken from the laws of
Kentucky, and ask that they may be printed, thit
Senators may have an opportunity to consider
them before the bill comes up, and be prepared to
act upon them when it shall be before the Senate.
The PRESIDENT. They will be received in-
formally, but they cannot be received as amend-
ments, the bill not being before the Senate.
Mr. HAMLIN. I think the bill to which the
Senator refers is now with the committee and not
yet reported. The bill was recommitted to the
Committee on Commerce at this session, and it is
now undergoing further revision, and has not
again been reported to the Senate.
Mr. UNDERWOOD. I thought I had seen
the printed bill, but if it has been recommitted I
will nand my amendments to the committee in-
formally.
FRENCH SPOLIATIONS.
Mr. SMITH. I desire to submit a motion to
take up a bill that it may be made a special order,
if such a motion would be now in order. With
that view, I move that the Senate now take up the
bill to provide for the ascertainment and satisfac-
tion of claims of American citizens for spoliations
committed by the French prior to the 31st day of
July, 1801.
Mr. HUNTER. I would suggest to the Sena-
tor from Connecticut that the action of the Senate
at this session has been to make as few special or-
ders as possible, and in that way I believe the Sen-
ate will dispatch more business. I would suggest
to the Senator the propriety of letting the bill take
its course with others on the calendar.
Mr. SMITH. The bill was reported at a very
early day of the last session of Congress, with a
hope and expectation that it would receive consid-
eration at the hands of the Senate during that ses-
sion. The consideration of it, however, was posU
