Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION,April 17, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

I assumed command this morning. Have been through camp to-day. They are badly located, and must be changed as soon as possible. Custer's brigade has not gone yet. When shall I look for Chapman? I need some such brigade commander as Bob Williams, and want your assistance to get him.

(Received 1. 15 a. m., 18th.)

Major-General SIGEL,

Cumberland, Md.:

General Ord has been relieved from duty, at his own request. Send General Averell in command of the expedition already directed, or go yourself, as you deem most advisable. Should you go, it will be necessary to leave an officer in whose judgment you can place the greatest reliance to command everything you leave behind.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
