No. 12. Report of Captain J. M. Magruder, of skirmish at Montesano Bridge.

BAYOU SARA ROAD PICKET POST,

March 9, 1863.

GENERAL: My pickets at the Monteasno Bridge have just been driven in by the enemy. The enemy crossed on some drift-wood and planks at the bridge. One of our men, I am afraid, mortally wounded. I am near the bridge with about 50 men, watching their movements. I do not think it an advance in force. It was a cavalry force that attacked us. I will send a prompt account of any movements the enemy may make. I have o news from the plank road, which sustains me in the impression that no movement in force is contemplated. I will place pickets at Montesano Bridge again to-night. At present I think the enemy are at the bridge lying in ambush for us. There is great excitement in Baton Rouge to-day. The Yankees appear to have been fighting a sham battle all day. The firing of musketry has been continuous all day.

I am, general, very respectfully,

J. M. MAGRUDER,

Captain, Commanding Bayou Sara Picket Post.
