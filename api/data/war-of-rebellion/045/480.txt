Meade. They are entirely satisfactory. I have had no communication to send, but General Halleck has availed himself of the facility you provided.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

THURLOW'S, July 1, 1863. (Received 6. 10 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

We have organized a company of 100 of our operatives for protection of the railroad, and to go anywhere to meet an emergency. We want 100 Springfield muskets, first quality, which we will pay for at Government prices, if you will give an order for them. I can buy only those rejected by Government, and we don't want an inferior article.

S. M. FELTON.

OFFICE BOARD OF POLICE, Baltimore, July 1, 1863.

Major-General SCHENCK:

DEAR SIR: The board of police of the city of Baltimore are at all times ready to co-operate with the military power in maintaining the authority of the Government of the United States. Please direct that all requisitions for their services be addressed to the board of police. By order: Respectfully,

NICH'S L. WOOD,

President of the Board.

UNION LEAGUE HOUSE,

Philadelphia, July 1, 1863-10. 30 p. m. (Received 11. 50 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The undersigned are profoundly impressed with the peril of this city, the safety of which now hangs on the issue of a battle, in which Meade's defeat must be regarded by every sensible man as a possible contingency. The troops here, or on the Susquehanna, whatever their number, are, with very few exceptions, utterly raw. Under these circumstances, we do urge upon you to call instantly upon the Governors of all States east of us to send us whatever soldiers are at the moment available. It is a simple premium of insurance against our ruin. We are of one mind on this question.

B. GERHARD.

J. G. FELL.

JAMES H. ORNE.

JAMES L. CLAGHORN.

J. R. FRY,

Chairman of Military Committee,
