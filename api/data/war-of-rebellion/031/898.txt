A cavalry raid has passed by Fairfax toward Leesburg. It is quite possible that they will attempt to cross the river and cut the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad or threaten Harper's Ferry. Every precaution should be taken to intercept them and to prevent damage to the road.

Some of my troops occupied Annandale last night. The rebel cavalry passed between there and Fairfax Court-House last night, moving in the direction of Lewinsville. I at this moment learned that a force of rebel cavalry, taking about two hours and a half, passed through Vienna, commencing at 12 a.m. last night. They were followed as far as Hunter's Mills, and then struck off toward the Ox road at Frying Pan. Had about 40 prisoners, including citizens.
