Major-General KIMBALL,

Mossy Creek:

Colonel Kirby left one regiment to-day to protect supplies at Morristown. I wish you to relieve this regiment with another, leaving eight companies at Morristown and two companies at Mossy Creek. Let the eight companies wait in the morning until the artillery comes up as a guard for the artillery train. I will come on and join you at Russellville. You had better draw four days' supplies for your command at Morristown. Until things settle we will have to guard the bridge.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,New Market, East Tenn., March 25, 1865.

Brigadier General W. L. ELLIOTT,

Huntsville, Ala.:

Your dispatch received. Everything is now unloaded at Knoxville. Charge all officers to unload promptly. When your troops come I want to carry them to the front by rail; therefore, time will be gained by starting the transportation forward as soon as unloaded. One good regiment will be enough for a train guard. I will have an officer at Knoxville.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.

Colonel KIRBY,

Morristown, Tenn.:

Leave a regiment at Morristown until General Kimball reaches that point. General Kimball passed through here one hour ago. Will camp at Mossy Creek to-night.

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
