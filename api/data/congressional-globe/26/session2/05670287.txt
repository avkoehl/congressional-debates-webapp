futiher, lhat the pay ot ire ¡«borers, after a giver
day, would be i educed frum sixty to ft iy cents per
diem. In verification of ¡bis statement I now pro-
dace, from the Richmond Whig of the 25th inst.
the following as a true copy of the circulars I saw
addressed to different individuals-
'Enoi^íele s Office,
"Old Point Comfort August 18,1840
"Sir You are hereby informed that the laborers employed
on the fortifications in Hampton Ro^ds will not be paid until
the 1st day of January, or, should the Government prefer it
until the 1st Jay of April next
' You are also informed that under the present circumstances,
the pay of the laborer, afer the 1st day of September next,
will be Axed at fifty centsper day, instead ofsixiy cents, which
is now paid for then
"I am, with respect, sir, your obedient servant,
R  E  De RUS *, Lieut Col Enemeers
'To Mr Wm Jennings, liamfton "
Two circulars like this, in every word and
figure, were placed in my hands at Hampton, .tnd
I have one now, m manuscript, signed by this
same officer, Lieut Col R E. De Russy, who, I
am confident, would not have issued such circu-
lars without authority from the War Department
In vmd cation, sir, of that officer, I now ask my
honorable c illeague [Mr Jones] whether ha knows
that the Secretary of War did cause to be «sued
authority for this circular1
[Mr Jones of Virginia said that, after a conver-
sation wuh hit colleague, [Mi. Wise,] he (Mr
Jones) had called on the Secretary ot War io as-
certain the facts of ihe case, he had expec'ed that he
should, ere this, have received a written commu-
nication on the subjec , he had, however, under-
stood the Secretary of War to state that, under the
power conferred upon tae President by the act of
ihe last session, to postpone the appropriations for
fortifications, &c. written instruct ons were given to
the superintendents of the works from which it was
proposed to withhold the appropriations, to dis-
charge the laborers employer' oi tijem, retaining as
many as might be necessary to prefer e and t?ke
care of a large amount ot perishable property be-
longing to ihe United Sutes That this course was
rendered necessary in consequence cf an a ipre-
hended deficiency in tne Treasury, w.ich woull
put it out < t the power of the Depart-ntnt to ad-
vanc* funds for these objects, unul the lot of Janu-
ary, 1841, or the 1st of Apn , and that the laborers
employed ehou)d have nonet of lhe*e mstr ictions,
as well as ihe owncs of slaves, where slaves were
employsd, and that it was1 at the earn st request of
the laborers themselves, that thev were allowed to
go on, wuh a distinct un 'erstanding tt> >t f-py
would not b  paid until either Ihe 1st of Jamnry or
the 1st of April, at the pleasure of ihe Government.
As to the reduction of wag s, of which his col-
league spoke, he had called Ihe atten ion of the
Sectary to that subject al«o, and his answer was,
that there existed no ro^d reason, in hi^ opinion,
why the persons employed on the public works
should be nail higher wages than were rece ve i
by those doing hire service in othei place , and
that ihe wagt" paid were a full equivalent for (he
services performed ]
Mr Wi-j I th^nk my colleague fir h s frank
answer, whuh cof firms mv statement, and shows
thatLt Col R E Di Russ, ha i authority It r is-
suing this circt!It- My obj-ct wis "o how by th"
statement that there is on outstanding lublic debt—
unknown, unliquidated, u measured But I no\v
go further, and say thm p\\ men* for wo'k ?nd la-
bor done and perfoimcd and r giof's furnished for
Government has Deen ptstponed wi horn nodce to
credt'i rs bet re the work was dote, < - ihe goods
fu-nishcd. I have a witne s on this fl oi who, I
believe, is himself a public ce tnci, wi bout noi.ee
before the debt was contracted, to v i om pn'tnent
has, m like rnannei, been poitpmel I refer to
my colleague from the Norfolk distnc , [Mr Mal-
loby,] and ask him to state Mieiher such be not the
fact
[Mr Mallory, in answer to the call of his col
league, observe-t that the statement made by Mr
Wisf, save in one particular, was substantially
correct The Government was not indebted to Mr
M. for any thing, -a hatcver it might be to his neigh-
bors The c rcul?r just read to the Honse he
could vouch for, havm¡; seen several list summer
in the hands of his constituents, who were not a
httle surprised at the notice, but who, having re-
timed th°ir sU.es for toe parpóse of ,vor.<ins, on
these for fixations had no choice le t but to k°ep
them at ho ne in idleness, or to trust the United
States for their wag-s The officer superintending
the e w rks, he well knew, had  ot acted w thout
instructions fro-n h-aoquartei-s, and he {eh. assured
that his ne ghbors h d made no such app icatior. as
that a hided to m the letter of the Secretary of
War read at the Clerk's desk a few c'aj s ago This
poslpi nement proceeded, doubtless, from ihe "light
ness m the Treasury,'" to use the words of his c il-
league, [Mr Jones] md 'o show bow groa1 was
this "t £,hiness," Mr M stated that he ha 1 be n in-
fame 1 by inose in whom he plac d every 'elianc,
that the bread and m°at furnished on Government
account to the laborers on these works w s not
even paid for, to say nothing of 'he wages of these
men, wmch remained unpaid since August last
But the 'tightne s m the Treasury" went even fur-
ther than this postponement of the price of labor
and bread A bill of §9 for surveying a srnill
piece of land, purchased by the United S ales for
the use of Fort Monroe, was presented, and pay-
ment deferred for the want cf funds. This he ha 1
from the surveyor himself, a fr* days t efore leav-
ing home Mr M *aid he had been wont to charge
ihe hononbi Secretary of ne Treasury with p r
mittirg a habit of "looseness" (as Mr V M Ga
re-ctit would say) to work on the Tieasury, bi t he
regrette 1 this runtim? latí ano her ettrerne, whiei
had occasioned a tightness th„t greatly incom-
moded -md injured those ¡n Government emp'oy ]
Mr Wise It matters not, sir, whether th° post-
ponement o' payment was for work done, or to b 
ootie, the work is don  by th s tim°, and the pay-
ment is postponed Ihivt proved mo" than in Í
*tated I do not usually atlempt to prove my <is-
serti ns I have tafc-n the trouble lo do it in th s
i istanre because I am informe 1 lhat a commuoi-
catnn dreitel to tne memb r from Orno [Mi
Doncam] horn the Secre, ar of War eem d to
ontradict my sta ement
[Bert several gentlemen said to Mr Wise, "No,
it i onlj substantnlly tre same as what Mt Jo\ss
sa5s, which cotifirms your statement "
Mr Wi<e continued I have nevr seen or
he ird i', nor do I care what it contairs I hould
not be suipused if it cc ntradicted not * nij my
statement, but the Hon. Secretary's own s'atement
to my cc l)ea?ue, [Mr Jines,] asvellps ihe file
of the Depaitment itcelf Ni matter what is its
character 'or verac ty, I like not the mode in

Hav ns cleared the decks rf th s matter of fac',
I now pr'cecd to the regular ■"eb-it 
Sir, I freely pardon my fuendfrom Kctucky
[Mr Pope] for depriving me ot ihe fkor I ?ni
vj e he intended no injustice rr disrespect and
would not have insisted on his claim to the floor '
he had understood the case as I did He was, in
deel, from age, experience, and ability, e-titkd to
the precedence ot me or almost any other gentle-
man m the House    I am glad that he preceded me
in debate, and that I obtained the b-nefit of his en-
lightened views It is true, as he says, that I am
in debí to him for his attention to me on a former
occasion—at the called session, near midnight,
when, before I commenced a four hours' speech,
I invited gentlemen to, go home and go to bed.
Nearly all accepted my invitation except the
gentleman from Kentucky, who, as he says,
'sat me out" And, sir, from that time to this, I
have a wajs made it my duty and my pleasure, as
it was to-lay, to "sit him out" He always re-
minds me of this obligation, and I am always fully
repaid by faithfully observing it Are we now
even in compliments'! The gentleman nods assent,
and I am ¡satisfied.
Sir, though no-*, indisputably entitled to the floor,
I kno*y not whether I ought to occupy it. I am
phj-iicilly unfit lo talk in this hall for two or three
hours It my own friends had bee  content to
vo e ui silence, I would have been silent toa. I
sioull much have preferred to meet them liks
brothe-s apart in caucus, to conciliate ourdiff-r-
enees, rather than to bring these differences into
the c li s,on oí debate here
I regret to take the flor r, too, because I am pain-
ed to dtifer fiom any of my friends. But th-y
have chosen to advance and defend (heir vote&
and thiir views, and have rendered it necessary
¡or me fi advance and ¡o defend mine. If they
would not remain silent, they mus.t not complain *f
I speak If they will attempt to give impression to
public opinion, so must I If they will attempt to
mat u'aeture public sentiment here to affect those
coming into power, I must in time undeceive those
^oo an soon to become the Executive. If they
dtffei irom me, they must not murmur at my dif-
fering from them, especially, when no two ot
hem hive as yet agreed with each other If they
Wih Voate here, h<-re I am leadyto meet them
I reg et, moreover, hat Í ?m now compelled lo
vo e tor this b 11 lo i'sue Treasury notes. I shall
try io make it as perfect as possible before I do
vo e for it, by an amendment which 1 shall offer as
soon as th* pending motion is di posed of, but,
thoufh my amendment should fail, I will vote for
the bi 1 as ' i I have always voted against the
various bills i^ereiofore to issue Treasury notes
