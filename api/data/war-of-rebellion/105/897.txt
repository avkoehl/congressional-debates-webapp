I do not consider your letter in the light of a rebuke, but it is respectfully suggested (the door being open for Captain Moore to be assigned to district headquarters and left behind, a post he may desire), whether it is not possible he may endeavor so to comport himself as to produce dissatisfaction. It is probable he will shortly proceed to Fort Yuma, there to attend to important matters connected with my movements.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES H. CARLETON

Colonel First California Volunteers, Commanding.
