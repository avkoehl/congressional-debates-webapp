I dependent Treasury—Mr. Farrish.
H. of Reps.
The above iib't« piei are.1 from t'ie annual
i*por«s cf t5 e S-er-tarv o- the Tre stirv, shows the
relative interest in ¡i t~ c «mtrv, so faf as exports
and ban  p'.>fns arising trvm leans and disco'iuts,
are eoncei eed.
On eximm.Vir;  I think it will he el arly sho\rn,

of numbers or imp  r'aice in tVs country. Bill,
of all oih?:s-, theinboiintr and producing classes are,
■ad will or, the prea'est. Wnat has been the
legislation which thi< theory has fiven rise to?
Mor* than tbree-f ^unhs of the acti -n of C mgre*s

•xHoMve'y. On the cher band, w^ere is the

would se-l the I ps of those who now pro'ess so
loudly in favor of !ab.>r. H'-v h*s- it be- n with
the cotton interests? I  is true, w thin a few year ;,
the other g-o«n>g interest force' 't>elf cp n \otir

system to i's utmost tension; but when h. -. th-* te-
baeco and provision interes'«¡ received any legisla-
tive protect on at \our haud^l Even ihe silk-cul-
toie, that demand"-! so loudly, has no' yet bptn
h-ard successful y. Tr-e labores, the provision
grower*, and t ie arriciti'n ¡--t^, hive roti re's ad
in the fo'-r .'ion o' the c wry, and rrav be ab'e
to stand w tiout «p'cal pr< teciton from C"i)gr s;;
but they cannot stand if you csnlinue to leeri-hte
against them; and they have a rght to expect and
11 demand that yen will not eontinu-1 to burden at d
grind thent wi'h heavy txxes in tt.e fcrm ot duties.
This has been thetff ct oi this theory. The same
month in wh'ch the Bank of the Uni'td was char-
tered in 1818, the taxe-. under th  name of protec-
tion were raised, and went on increasii g every few
year*, un'tl it ou\d le no ionser birne by the
cotton growing States of the Union; an j their re-
sistance led to *h"> foTip'o^ii; art of 18?3, wh'ch,
after 1835, begaa to tp*ia e by ^'«h* reducti n.
For the pu'pooe of sK«'<.nir Ihe incrensjl txa-
tion and ifc> prujress w, h the Bank of the Urn e.l
States on t' U a*simed theory of protection, I
have prepared the following tab'e, with the rate of
duty imposed by each tariff sin^e the orgai.izition
of the Government, on a few articles, of m >st uni-
versal use, and especially by tho<e„ cla^e* that arc
said to be dipcn'mt <~n com-^^rce, biukers and
wwnu/ie.urers.    [S-e Table, nett coiurnn.]
This table íhorcs h"W he ('uf es have been in-
creased upon ihe .ait.'c'is given, since the firM few
year< of th- Govern'p<-n*. It a'so >h' *-> h >w

laborer, mechanic, art'san, farmer, and agricu!-

rates I submit the foibwin? rxamination:

Add rec Hera carriage, pr^fir, &c.

ed at fifteen per cent             • 2i        171
Th- average cost to the consumer being, as you
have sfet, 171 cen's.
Tne-e profits are low and lower than a majority
do buMt.es at, and yet all perceive that nene of
these persons hue any thi-ig by the du^', but the
la«t who buys for u c. On the cor.traty eich ha*
t*>e 'a ne profit on ihe duty, as on ih" original va-
lue of the article. Th" importer has mure. If he
manufactures or buys the srtice abroad, and no
duty b- cha-grd, he would have his profit of ten
per cnt. on th? cos', (6 cent*,) anil carriage
(i cent) only; but by charging the duty (J c<*nt) on
which he has credit, from 4 to 19 months, without
mtcre-it, he gets his profit of ten per cen'. on it,
jn«t as he di e* ''it the original cost and car-
riigf, ardihis wi hout n^k or investment.
It is <tili irnie advantageous to the home
manut'acln er, b r he pays neither tax nor duty,
and yrt he sel's nt the tame price, ot hi.-hcr
than the impoiter. R'nvniber the argun.en',
in favor of the duty, i< to prevent our mtnu-
factnrer from being undersold.
Wnat difference do t*iese duties make in tbe
pri'e of articles purchased and ustd by ihe con-
sumei? Tne answer is found in the following ex-
amination:
Take the rame yard of  heeling or any
other kin j tf cotton   goods  at  its va-
lue of                 -           -           -            6 cents.
Cost of transportation, 41 percent,              i "

Add importer's or manulacturet's profit
of ten percent.
Cn«t to the wholesale merchant is
AJd his profii of 5 per cent.
The cost of the article to the retailer is
Aüd his profit, can ¡age, &c. 15 per cent.

Now suppose a laborer, mechanic, or farmer,

By the above table and calculations, we see how
this splendid system of indirect taxation operates,
under the existing laws. By it, the consumer pays
a tax into the Treasury of $3 37, and to merchant?
and officers through whose hands the goods and
money pass, the sum of $1 561; and for the same
articles which, withont this system, he could, and
should, If his interests were as much regarded .as
some others, buy for about $8 634, he is now com-
pelled to pay $13 565.
Now I ask if there is a day laborer, mechanic,
or farmer, throughout this whole country, who does
not, either for himself or family, it he has one, in
the course of one year, purchase cotton, calico,
flannel, cloth, and such kind of articles, to tbe
amount of thirteen dollars and fifty-six cents, or
more] There is not, 1 believe; and the majority
purchase twice this amount. Here, then, is the
whule taxing process by which the public money in
this country is ratred; and this system, that falls so
heavily, and almost exclusively, on the laboring
and producing classes, is increased from year ta
year, under the plausible pretext of protecting ma-
nufactures, and encouraging commerce, until, this
year, the whole «urn estimated to be drawn from
the people is fifteen millions of dollars; and to
make credit for/ these interests which are lo be pre-
lected by this system, the money thus drawn from
the people is to be given to banks, out of which to
make what they can.
Suppo>c Ongress was to pass a law expressly
requiring every laborer, farmer, or other person,
who bought cotton, calico, flannel, or cloth,
to the amount of eight dollars and fifty cents
in one year, to pay to the merchant or store
keeper one dollar fifty-fix and a fourth cents,
and an additional tax into the Treasury of
the United Spates, of three dollars and thirty-
seven an J a half cents, for the use of the Govern-
ment, and for protecting manufactures—4bar the
money thus paid, amounting in all to the who'e re-
venues cf tbe country, thould be given to the
banks to use for their own profit, under pretence
of affording credit and facility to commerce,
would not the American people complain, and
would they submit to such a system) It seems to
«nt they wonid require its repeal.   Yet'«her«y t**t
