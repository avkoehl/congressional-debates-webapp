RESACA, October 15, 1864.

Captain L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp:

I spoke to General Elliott this evening in relation to the conversation I had with General Sherman concerning a charge in the disposition of the fragments of my command, now near this place and Cartersville. The general informs me that these men were placed there in accordance with instructions from General Thomas, and he would not feel authorized to move them without General Sherman's orders. The whole DIVISION train is at Cartersville, where my headquarters are ordered to be, and my records, and only 175 men of mine I think entirely too meager a force to take care of it in the event of anything that would complied the force to evacuate. In addition, I feel most anxious to get all my DIVISION as nearly together as may be consistent with the good of the service.

E. M. McCOOK,

Brigadier-General, Commanding First Cavalry DIVISION.

If any order is made General Elliott will probably be at Resaca. I leave for Cartersville in the morning.

On account of the scarcity of forage in the vicinity of Cartersvile, as represented by General McCook, I recommend that the headquarters of his DIVISION and detachments, now at Cartersville, be ordered to Calhoun or Resaca.
