crossed the Mattapony at Dunkirk this morning and moved toward White House. He has not yet appeared, but I suppose he will cross to-night. There is not more than a brigade of infantry at the White House, protected by two boats. Five boats are there, but the firing was confined to two. I have occupied Cumberland Landing and I can hold it.

If you can now send a force to take White House and drive the boats down the river, they can be captured. If his place can be taken a very large train can be captured. Sheridan will be forced to retreat again. With one brigade of infantry I can take the place. If my cavalry is here to co-operate we can take large numbers of prisoners, horses, wagons, &amp;c. I suggest the operation to you for your consideration. If no troops can be sent I shall watch Sheridan, striking if I can. This brigade of infantry makes him much stronger than I am. There never will be a better opportunity to crush this cavalry than is now offered. If I can get the troops I will follow him up to the last. Should he attempt to march to Grant, if all the cavalry on this side of the river can be concentrated, he can be destroyed. I am greatly in need of artillery horses as mine are broken down. If any action looking to the defeat of the forces here is taken, it is important that it should be prompt. May I beg you to let General Lee know the contents of this dispatch.

I am, very respectfully,

WADE HAMPTON,

Major-General.
