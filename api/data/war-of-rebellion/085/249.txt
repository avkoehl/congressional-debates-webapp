for have a discretion to act as your information justifies. It may be advisable for you to send three regiments with the train to the Sallisaw, and while they are gone concentrate everything in your fortifications as much as possible. Colonel Williams can remain with you with his brigade for awhile, if necessary, unless something serious presents itself here. If he comes to the Sallisaw he can return to Gibson. I ordered you to send the Eleventh Colored back with the machines, but I presume you have retained it, which is right. If the train comes through here the machines can move with it.

Very respectfully,

JOHN M. THAYER,

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

General Sanborn telegraphs as follows to-day:

Moses Powers, a scout of General Steele's, arrived here to-night, having left little Rock one week ago yesterday. He reports that Price's entire army-cavalry, infantry, and artillery-has crossed the Arkansas and are now in the valley of the White River, near Batesville. Shelby was still at Jacksonport. All the rebels estimate Price's force at 50,000 men; the scout says 26,000. Price brought with him twenty-five pieces of artillery. Marmaduke crossed the river below Pine Bluff and came to Batesville; Magruder to move upon Little Rock from the south with 30,000 men. The rebels all talked of capturing Little Rock before proceeding north, and then coming to Missouri to spend the winter there and in Kansas.

I send it for what it is worth, being too remote to communicate with General Canby.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

General SANBORN,

Springfield:

Your dispatch received. Question that man very closely; find how he got his information, and don't let him go till you are satisfied he is all right and what his information is worth. Answer.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 19, 1864.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Seven hundred of the Thirteenth Missouri Veteran Cavalry, now assembled at Benton Barracks, armed and equipped, need horses. Please order Colonel Merrill to mount them at once, as we shall unquestionably have an extensive raid into this State soon.
