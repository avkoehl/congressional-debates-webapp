CAMP GAULEY, VA., November 11, 1861.

Since last night rebels have fallen back to within 3 miles of Fayette. The river too high to cross our force at they ferry above. Their position regarded as impracticable, but which we are prepared to use. Three men attempting to escape from that side of the river came down to cross to our side. Two crossed, and our concealed guard foolishly sprang out, took prisoners, alarming the other, on whom they fired, and he ran away. The enemy was discovered breaking his camp about 8 o'clock, taking position within 2 or 3 miles of the ferry crossing. At which General Schenck nevertheless in unwilling to advance. Benham will occupy position ion their front and flank to-morrow morning, reconnoiter, and engage them. If they stand,i think General Schenck will cross over in their rear and we will bag them.
