Mr. CURTIS. I now desire io move for an
order on the proper ofiicer of tho Senate to
furnish, so that we may put into the case, a
statement of the dates of the beginning and
end of each session of the Senate, including,
of course, its executive sessions as well as its
legislative, from the origin of the Government
down to the present time. That will enable us,
by comparing those dates with these facts which
we put into the case, to see what was done
within and what was done without the session
of the Senate.
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chief Justice
is of opinion that that is an application which
can only be addressed to the Senate in legisla-
tive session. If the court desire it he will
vacate the chair in order that the President
pro tempore may take it.
Mr. CURTIS. I would state, Mr. Chief
Justice, that we have now concluded our doc-
umentary evidence as at present advised : we
may possibly desire hereafter to offer some
additional evidence of this character, but as
we now understand it we shall not.
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. Chief Justice, I move
that the Senate, sitting as a court of impeach-
ment, adjourn until to-morrow at twelve
o'clock.
The motion was agreed to; and the Sen-
ate sitting for the trial of the impeachment
adjourned.
Thursday, April 16, 1868.
The Chief Justice of the United States took
the chair.
The usual proclamation having been made
by the Sergeant-at-Arms,
The Managers of the impeachment on the
part of the Ilouse of Representatives and the
counsel for the respondent, except Mr. Stan-
bery, appeared and took the seats assigned tliem
respectively.
The members of the House of Representa-
tives, as in Committee of the Whole, pre-
ceded by Mr. E. B. Wasiiburne, chairman of
that committee, and accompanied by the
Speaker and Clerk, appeared and were con-
ducted to the seats provided for them.
The CHIEF1 JUSTICE. The Secretary will
read the Journal of yesterday's proceedings.
The Secretary proceeded to read the Jour-
nal, but was interrupted by
Mr. SHERMAN. I move that the reading
of the Journal be dispensed with.
The CHIEF JUSTICE. If there be no ob-
jection the reading of the Journal will be dis-
pensed with. There being no objection, it is
so ordered.
Mr. SUMNER. Mr. President, I send to
the Chair a declaration of opinion to be adopted
