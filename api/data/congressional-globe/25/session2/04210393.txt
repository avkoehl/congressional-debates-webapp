At this stage—-
Mr CALVARY MORRIS picsented the p-ti-
tion of 177 of the inhabitants ot Marietta and its
v cintty, respectfully requesting Congress to mter-
p(se its authority, and prevent the treaty between
ttie United States and the Cherokee nation fiom
be ng carried into effect, without the well-ascer-
t ned assent of that nation to said treaty On pre-
sen iing thu petition, Mr M said
Mr. Speaker, the names which I find attached to
this petition command too much respect at home
and abroad to justify me, as their Representative,
in ba'ely presenting the petiuon and peimittmg it
to be laid on the table, as smuhr petitions have
ben, without some effort on my part to procure its
refeience, and for it a respectful consideration
Mane ta was  the first settlement made m that
Territory, which now constitutes the State of Ohio,
and upon this petition I find the names of some
who encountered the dangers, endured the toils,
and suffered that privations connected with the
early settlement of the country. Thrown as they
were m 'he midst of Indian hostilities, and min-
gling, as they subsequently did, with them m the
more iiiendly relations of life, afforded them a
good opportunity of becoming acquainted with the
Indian character,and, knowing it, they know how to
appreciate it In the petition they express their
fears that the treaty was obtained fraudulent-
1>, and with these feelings, sir, they are too honora-
ble, too highminded, and too magnanimous to re-
main silent, and see their country inflicting, as
they believe, cruel and unmitigated wrongs upon
a weak, but magnanimous people [Here the
Speaker reminded Mr M that it wis not m order
to debate this quostion at this time ] Mr M re-
plied Mr Speaker, I am aware that it is not
in order to discuss the merits of this ques-
tion on the presentation of a petition, nor do
I wish, on this, or any other occasion to vio-
late the rules of this House
I will only add one or two remarks more, and
if, m so doing, I am out of order, I will thank the
Speaker to remind me of it
I am infoimed, sir, by a letter which accompa-
nied the petition, and from a source highl) respec-
table, that our people have a good deal of feeling
on the subject of this treaty If their suspicions
aiewell founded, ought not Congress to ímme-
dutely institute an inquiry into the facts connected
with it, and if ihey are groundless, the Govern-
ment has nothing to fear from such an investiga-
tion But, su, let this House refuse to lefer or
consider the petitions of the people on this subject,
and do \ou nol, I ask, thiow around the whole
trvn-.lotion dvil suspicions, which (very lover of
the honor ot his countrj ought to ie, lobite?
Mi OWENS moved to laj it on the nble, (be-
ing a disposition nnde of numerous othtis during
the day, on moti >n of Mr 0 and Mr TIaym-s
without a division of the House )
Mr MORRIS demanded the yeas and najs,
which being ordeied,
Mr CHAPMAN moved a call of the House,
as the attendance of members was thin, but it was
lefused, and the motion to lay on the table was de-
cided m the ailumative—yeas 107, najs 71, as fol-
