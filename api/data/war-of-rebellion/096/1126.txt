In conclusion, I beg leave to say that I do not fear that the men of this division will do any act which will bring discredit upon their bright record-a record second to none-and I think the person who made the report to the Department behaved imprudently.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. W. FIELD,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS, January 27, 1865.

Respectfully forwarded to General Cooper for his information.

I hope the report which reached him was without foundation, and trust this brigade, which has served so well, will continue to the end.

Respectfully submitted to Secretary of War for his information.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

[Fourth indorsement.]

FEBRUARY 1, 1865.

Received and read with great satisfaction.

It was difficult to believe that a brigade which had won such deserved could entertain any thought derogatory to themselves and their country, and the assurance now given is only what was hoped and expected.

J. A. S.,

Secretary.

Major General C. W. FIELD,Commanding Division:

General Longstreet directs that you have your division under arms, in line of battle, right resting on Darbytown road, to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. LATROBE,
