PERSONAL CHANGES IN THE OFFICE.

At the commencement of the official year, November 1, 1864, the personal force of the office consisted of six officers and fifty- two clerks. In consequence of the economical measures heretofore mentioned, and of the diminution in the numbers of the corps, this force has decreased until it now amounts to one officer and nine clerks.

Colonel M. N. Wisewell, Veteran Reserve Corps, was relieved from duty as chief of the Bureau on the 20th of December, 1864. Captain James McMillan, of the Second Regiment U. S. Infantry, subsequently appointed brevet major, replaced him, and held the position until October 2, 1865, since which the undersigned has been in charge.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. DE FOREST,

Captain, Veteran Reserve Corps, and Actg. Asst. Adjutant- General.
