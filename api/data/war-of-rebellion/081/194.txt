As a rough estimate I would say our loss before Petersburg will not exceed 3,000. All the dead and wounded that have not been cared for are in our reach and are being attended to. Among the casualties I am sorry to report five of the wounded are brigade commanders. I will also make report of the state of affairs along our line in a few minutes.

A. E. BURNSIDE.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 18, 1864-2.35 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

Your dispatch received and given to General Burnside.* General Parke thinks if the left and center of Birney advance they can then certainly carry the enemy's position. As the position is now it forms nearly a right angle with General Burnside. Burnside and Warren will attack again in twenty-five minutes.

[Indorsement.]

Sent to General Birney with a request that if he can advance Barlow, as well as the attack on Gibbon's front, it will be well to do it. I desire to make a strong effort along the whole line.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

What progress? I have not heard anything from you. Warren and Martindale report progressing, and Birney is about attacking with his whole corps. I hope you are going to-day to outdo yesterday.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

NINTH CORPS, June 18, 1864-5.30 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

We are slowly but steadily progressing, and will continue to press as long as possible. The condition of our forces renders it necessary to move carefully and to keep the men well in hand. I have just returned
