their intended point of junction is near the mouth of Heart River. Some of the Sisseton head mean have arrived at Fort Abercrombie, and given their assent to the only terms upon which they will be allowed peace.

Those desirous of a restoration of friendly relations with the Government will number probably 200 or 250 lodges, and they have been directed to go to Devil's Lake, where a place will be assigned them, and where they will receive protection from hostile Indians by the military authorities. I am busily engaged in preparations for the march of the column to join you on Bois Cache or Bordache Creek, and although the season is backward I think the grass will subsist the animals by the 1st of June, when the detachment will move from the designated point on the upper Minnesota River. Brackett's battalion has received my orders to march to Sioux City from Fort Snelling 2nd proximo, and will probably reach Sioux City by 15th, as I informed you in a previous dispatch.
