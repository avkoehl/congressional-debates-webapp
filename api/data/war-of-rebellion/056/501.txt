rest attacks in front. He estimates General Forrest's forces at about 4,000 fighting men. I have been up as far as Mifflin with the advance of my command. Colonel Mizner had a sharp skirmish with about 600 of the enemy on the 24th; he drove them, and they retreated toward Mount Pinson. I had intended to move on nearer Jackson the next day, but I received information that Forrest had left Jackson and was trying to cross the Hatchie; I therefore made a forced march back to this place, where I arrived this morning. I sent a dispatch to General Smith from Mifflin yesterday, and send another to-day.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Forrest was moving with whole force toward Somerville at noon to-day from direction of New Castle. I think, however, he will turn back to-night and go to Saulsbury. He may try Moscow, though. I have ordered Mower into Corinth. Smith is after him. Has he a pontoon with him?

Colonel MIZNER,

Corinth, Miss.:

On your arrival at Corinth, if the wire should be cut s you cannot communicate with me, you will move with your whole available force southwest toward Ripley. Communicate with me by courier. The enemy will endeavor to cross the railroad to-night or tomorrow between here and Pocahontas. You will march with three or four days' light rations and no wagons.
