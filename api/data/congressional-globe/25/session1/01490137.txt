riiffeience in the matter The same checks and
(ontrol exist in the one case as the other And
the banl s are as muéh bound to answer the
drafts ot the public Treasury, as the public
officers could be, and would as readily answer them
Human nature is essentially the same under equal
ciicurnstances, and the officers of banks, would be
quite as likely to act undei the influence of tempta-
tion to execute a coi rapt Executive will, sufficient |
inducements being oTered, as would the collecting
officers of the Government I come now to the only
remaining question—the question of the safety oí
tie public retenue under the system proposed
And in discussing this question, I must be permitted
to inquire, what magic is imparled by an act oí
wcoiporation, by which the honesty of m°n be-
comes sc punfiedand refined that they are placed
above th  ordinary level of their iace? If the
home'y proverb of an English lawyer of foimer
days be due, corp lation morality has nothing 10
boast oí when compared with that oí individuals
But it is sud that allowing that public collecting
offiesrs aie generally as honest as the officers of
banks, yet the -Mock of the latter furnishes better
securny than an rndividual can offer On this
point I am at issue with the objector, anl say that
the public officer will be able to make the Govern-
ment as «ecure as the banks
/ But if tt were allowed that occasional Oefinlt
might be the consequence of confiding the custody
oí the public money to the collecting officers, how
long would it be before it wou'd amount to the loss
and inconvenience already experienced bycmplo\-
ing the bmks, and receiving bank paper in pay-
ment for public lands before the sjstem of cash
payments was adopted, or the inconvenience alrea-
dy experienced within the last five months, not to
say—foi \et it cannot be said—what losses maj in
Ihe end be s istamed in the debts now due bv the
la'e deposite banks
Notf —In making the hasty report of the foie-
gomg íemaiks, I gave more consequence to the re-
demption of the public debt than the course those
fern >rks, as deliv ered in debate, gave to it I have
no doubt that it was one of the most efficient
cause of that increase was the pernicious principle
ef establishing and conducting banks upon credit,
and not money.                                    C. E  H
