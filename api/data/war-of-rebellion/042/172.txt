GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. EASTERN SUB-DIST. OF TEXAS,

No. 40. Houston, August 16, 1863.

In obedience to the foregoing special order, I hereby assume command of the Eastern Sub-District of Texas, and will, until otherwise ordered, transact the business of the sub-district through the regular staff officers of Brigadier-General Scurry.

It may be necessary to say to the troops, in assuming the command, that while I will look closely to the interest of every officer and soldier under my command, I will enforce such discipline as the interest of our country requires. Without subordination an army is an armed mob, dangerous to civil liberty, useless to their country, and disgraceful to themselves.

Headquarters for the present at Houston.

H. E. McCULLOCH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding, &amp;c.
