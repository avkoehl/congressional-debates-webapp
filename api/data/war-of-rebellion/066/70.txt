Of the movements and dispositions of the enemy, I have reported in another letters.*

I would respectfully beg to be definitely informed whether I am to receive more troops here, and, if so, in what number. If not, I shall be obliged to make a different disposition of my forces, holding only the main points and chief lines of communication, such as Morris Island, Light-House Inlet, the south end of Folly Island, and Stono Inlet, abandoning the middle of Folly Island and Pawnee Landing, and holding Long Island only as a post of observation.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. SCHIMMELFENNIG,

Brigadier-General, Commanding District.

Lieutenant Colonel E. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Dept. of the South:

SIR: As has already been represented by me in other letters addressed to you this day, I consider it my duty to keep the enemy on my front as actively engaged as possible. I shall continue to do so in the hope of retaining a superior force before me as at present during the decision of the campaign in Virginia. To meet the enemy to advantage, with my reduced and inferior numbers, requires two conditions fulfilled: First, the power to concentrate a heavy artillery fire at any point without regard to ground and risk; second, superior facilities of transportation. As regards the first condition I have but four pieces of light artillery. To make up for this deficiency, I have made application for a supply of war rockets to be obtained, and would like to be informed whether the requisition for the same has been forwarded approved. In the matter of transportation, I regret to state that the only seaworthy boat capable of being used as a dispatch-boat, the Nellie Baker, was obliged to remain at Hilton Head last time she went down for repairs, and of the four boats used as ferries and for internal transportation the Philadelphia and Frazier are so out of repair as to be entirely unserviceable. In view of these facts, I would request that a serviceable dispatch-boat be ordered to report to me without delay.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. SCHIMMELFENNIG,

Brigadier-General, Commanding District.
