Office, also Black Creek and swamp, halt in for the night fifty miles from Savannah. Forage, which had been scarce since leaving Lumpkin's, was more plentiful in this neighborhood. December 7, our march greatly impeded by fallen timbers and bridges burned across creeks. December 8, more especially at Ebenezer Creek, which the enemy had destroyed, blockading the road across the swamps. While a new bridge was being built the enemy attacked the skirmishers of General Baird's division. My regiment was immediately thrown into position, in the rear line of brigade, and threw up logs, &amp;c. At 11 p. m. my regiment crossed Ebenezer Creek, and halted near the church. December 9, moved from Ebenezer, crossing Ebenezer Creek. Roads blockaded, bridges, slough ways, &c., torn up or burned along our entire march to-day; halted sixteen miles from Savannah. December 10, marched to the main road; passed a rebel redoubt near Fourteen Milestone; halted about noon ten miles from Savannah. December 11, marched toward the front, crossing the Charleston and Savannah Railroad, also the Macon and Savannah Railroad, to the Middle Ground road, near which my regiment built breast-works. December 12, moved at 4 p. m., crossing the Ogeechee Canal. I relieved with my regiment the Fifty-second Ohio Volunteers of Seventeenth Army Corps, who were on picket in front of the Lawton farm. I held this position until I was relieved by an Iowa regiment from the same brigade I had relieved. December 19, I moved with my regiment to rear line and camped near canal bridge until morning of December 21, when I moved with my regiment in rear of brigade and encamped with it on the Lawton farm, moving next day into Savannah. Total miles marched, --.

RECAPITULATION.

Casualties: William Budd, private Company G, captured by the enemy, Sandersville, November 26, 1864. I left Atlanta November 16, 1864, with 248 guns and entered Savannah December 22, 1864, with 268 guns. I sent two men to general hospital during the campaign and both were sick before leaving Atlanta. My command captured and turned over during campaign 70 head of cattle, 90 sheep, 20 hogs, 5 horses, and 21 mules. After marching something over 300 miles my regiment entered Savannah in better health, spirits, and condition in every respect, with the exception of clothing and more especially of shoes and stockings.

The saving in supplies to Government during the campaign by my regiment amounts to:

In forage: Pounds.

Sugar. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,400

While the above is a fair estimate of the saving to the Government the loss to the enemy may safely be put down as at least one-third additional in rations and one-half in forage.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. E. BRIANT,

Lieutenant Colonel, Commanding Eighty-eighth Indiana Volunteers.
