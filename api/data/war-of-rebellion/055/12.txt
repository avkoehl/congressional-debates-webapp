[CHAP. XLIII.

On the 25th, the whole of Missionary Ridge from Rossville to the Chickamauga was, after a desperate struggle, most gallantly carried by our troops, and the enemy completely routed. Considering the strength of the rebel position and the difficulty of storming his intrenchments, the battle of Chattanooga must be regarded as one of the most remarkable in history. Not only did the officers and men exhibit great skill and daring in their operations on the field, but the highest praise is also due to the commanding general for his admirable dispositions for dislodging the enemy from a position apparently impregnable. Moreover, by turning his right flank and throwing him back upon Ringgold and Dalton, Sherman's forces were interposed between Bragg and Longstreet, so as to prevent any possibility of their forming a junction.

Our loss in killed, wounded, and missing is reported at about 4,000. We captured over 6,000 prisoners, besides the wounded left in our hands, 42 pieces of artillery, 5,000 or 6,000 small-arms, and a large train. The enemy's loss in killed and wounded is not known.

While Generals Thomas and Hooker pushed Bragg's army back into Georgia, General Sherman with his own and General Granger's forces was sent into East Tennessee to prevent the return of Longstreet and to relieve General Burnside, who was then besieged in Knoxville. We have reliable information that Sherman has successfully accomplished his object, and that Longstreet is in full retreat toward Virginia; but no details have been received in regard to Sherman's operations since he crossed the Hiwassee, nor of Burnside's defense of Knoxville. It is only known that every attack of the enemy on that place was successfully repulsed.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War.
