HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 23, 1864-3.15 p. m.

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

SIR; I have just received your dispatch of 2 p. m. by Captain Bache. So far as I am concerned, all the movement are anticipated. My left crossed the railroad, and my right rests temporarily at Ox Ford, by a detached brigade, until General Burnside gets up. My counter opposite Taylor's Brigade, and I have three regiments across:

am just waiting for my artillery (with is very slow) to open, to see if I can make a bridge-head over there. If you hear firing, that will be it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers.

[First indorsement.]

Hancock has there regiments across. I should think, from present indications, Lee is going to hold the Pamunkey and South Anna. Shall Hancock cross his whole force, if practicable?

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

[Second indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,May 23, 1864-4.15 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

If Hancock can secure a crossing, he should do so. If, however, the bulk of the enemy appears to be the left of him, our cavalry should picket well down, to see that no department of the enemy gets in on our left.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 23, 1864-3.30 p. m.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

SIR: The brigade at Taylor's Bridge, if there was one there, is no longer standing. The stream is a small one; the water only about 12 inches deep, with a sunday bottom. The crossing-place is about 12 feet wide. A negro came in to-day; left Hanover Junction yesterday at 4.20 p. m.; says that the head of the enemy's column arrived there yesterday before obedient he left.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers.
