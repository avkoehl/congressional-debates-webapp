don railroad, from which point I have just returned. Your dispatch of 3.30 is only just received, too late to direct an attack. Hold on where you are for the present.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Near New Market Road, October 27, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

We have not beet able to turn the enemy's left, although Weitzel has demonstrated to the left of the Williamsburg road. I have there ordered him back to the Charles City road; sent one division in the line between Darbytown and Charles City, and massed two divisions with cavalry to hold to White Oak Swamp. Terry holds from Darbytown to our entrenched lines on the New Market road. Have you any orders?

BENJ. F. BUTLER.

CITY POINT, October 27, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

I have no special orders further than to direct that your troops keep as near all they now hold as they can favorably to receiving an attack, if the enemy can be induced to do such a thing. You need not make any further advance, however,unless it be in following up a repulse of the enemy. The enemy is now so extended that he must be very weak in the middle. If it is possible to get a force together for the purpose I would try an attack in the morning south of Bake-House Creek.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Major-General BUTLER,

At the Front:

A note just received from General Graham, stating that Lieutenant Day, stationed at Battery Marshall, reports that the enemy stationed in his front were quite busy during the night. He thought they were removing the artillery. Also, that he heard but one bugle call this morning and only three drum reveilles.

Major-General BUTLER,

At the Front:

Colonel Jourdan has been telegraphed to know about any firing on his line to-day, but no answer received yet. We have heard nothing of it here. Think you must have heard Dutch Gap. The army of the Potomac has reached the Boydton road.
