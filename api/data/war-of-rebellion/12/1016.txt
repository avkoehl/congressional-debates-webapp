General Cooke directed me to go over and report to General Porter and be the bearer of Major Williams and Lieutenant Byrnes reports. What happened at this end of the line after that I have no knowledge of whatever. About an hour or less after arriving at General Porters I receiveii an order from him to go with all speed with four squadrons of Lancers to Tunstalls Station, but to approach cautiously and avoid ambuscade. On arriving there I found General Reynolds with a part of his in- fantry brigade, and my operations thence in pursuit will be seen by a report which I was directed to make to him, which was done hastily and just on the eve of returning from Tunstalls Station to this camp, but see no reason for changing it materially.

The remaining four squadrons of my regiment were then moved farther down the Old Church road and halted in a field, where we met General Cooke. We remained here some timeuntil nearly sunsetthe First U. S. Cavalry, General Cooke, and General Emory being all present. Hearing that we were probably to be gone for twenty-four hours or more, I obtained permission to return with my regiment to camp, not a half mile distant, to get rations and forage, when I was to return and march with Colonel Warrens coummand to- ward Old Church. As we entered our camp ground we met Colonel Warren, then near sunset. Whilst in camp, at about sunset I received an order from General F. J.
