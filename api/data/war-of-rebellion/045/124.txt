Railroad west of you. He will take command of all troops west of Martinsburg, including General Averell's brigade, and concentrate them, as far as practicable, at New Creek, or other best points, at his discretion, to prevent the enemy from going westward. He will in this make such disposition of forces as may best accomplish that object. He may be able, perhaps, to make a stand at North Mountain.

By order of General Schenck:

Lieutenant-Colonel, Chief of Staff.

BALTIMORE, MD., June 15, 1863-12 m.

General TYLER,

Harper's Ferry:

At least two of the guns from the naval battery should be taken to points where they will flank both sides of Maryland Heights. The balance of the guns may be removed to the bluff west of the Sharpsburg road, where an earthwork is now being thrown up. Position must be selected for the guns intended to flank Maryland Heights, and places prepared for them.

DONN PIATT,

Chief of Staff.

Major General R. C. SCHENCK:

Officers and men just in from General Milroy show that he is wiped

out. I doubt if 500 will escape.

General SCHENCK,

Baltimore, Md.:

Colonel McReynolds has just come from the front. He reports that Generals Milroy and Elliott are within an hour's march of this city. He thinks that 2, 000 will cover his loss. Not nearly so bad as I had feared.

DAN. TYLER,

Brigadier-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington,

June 15, 1863.

Major-General SCHENCK,

Baltimore, Md.:

Do not give General Milroy any command at Harper's Ferry. We have had enough of that sort of military genius. If you have not already done so, send all your small posts and available troops there. That place must be held.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
