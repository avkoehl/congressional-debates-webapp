THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb 23,
to General Jackson on the 9th of August, li?14, by which
they colnpliun that, in runnins* the line to retain lands eon
quered from the htwtil? Initially, he run it in such a maimer
as to take a qinntily «>t the lands o: the friendly Indians,
for winch no equivalent was aft'iirdoil; anil express tlieir
retiaiK**' uti the justice of the United States to do them jus-
hr<*. Tile MiNjeet was brought ti.'liire ('iHiyrtvs in 1817, and
a ri'jort was at that time wide by the Committee on Ways
and Means, to which tlie committee beg leave now to refer
Sir a more satisfactory illustration of the foundation of the
ehum." * * * " It is the opinion of the committee that
the sum of $*5,000 appropriated by the law of 1HIT was
intended to be a till I indemnity for the losses of the friendly
Indians, and was equal to any reasonable expectation."
 ■   • The just and reasonable expectations of the
Indians at the date of the treaty are the foundation of the
rtaun of the friendly Creeks to indemnity ; and there does
not appear to be any obligation on the part of the United
States to exceed those expectations further than they have
done already."
It must be obvious to the most ordinary reflec-
tion, that if we go back thirty or forty years, and
open up claims which were adjusted and settled
by men then living, who were familiar with the
facts arid who understood the whole subject, it will
be setting a precedent which we ought not to estab-
lish, and reopening claims already adjudicated,
which should not be done except upon the clearest
evidence that wrong has been suffered, and that the
claim ought to be reexamined and a further allow-
ance made. I think the matter was fully investi-
gated at that time by the Committee on Ways
and Means in 1824; and this will be seen by the '
report made by them upon that occasion. They dis-
cussed the claim for lands as well as that for addi-
tional compensation for loss of personal property,
and they rejected it for one as well as for the other,
and came to the conclusion that ample indemnity
had been allowed. The case remained in that sit-
uation after 1824, during the whole of the admin-
istration of General Jackson. During the entire
eight years of that Administration, no application
was made, so far as I can discover, upon the part of
these Indians for any additional allowance. Sir, if
these I ndtans had just or equitable claim for money
or lands, why was it not presented during the ad-
ministration of General Jackson? Why was it
not presented to the man who made the treaty, and
who negotiated the whole business; the man who
-understood it, and who proved himself the friend
as well aa the conqueror of the Indians, and
who has upon all proper occasions, as history
will show, stood by ana defended their interests ?
Whatever may have been the faults in the char-
acter of that man, no one oppressed or persecuted
ever told his story to that brave old man, and
• went away with his grievances unredressed, if it
was in his power to afford protection or relief. But,
sir, this claim remained in that situation until the
last Congress, when these Indians came forward
and made a further application to be paid the addi-
tional amount, which Commissioner Mitchell had
reported due them, and a further appropriation
was made to the amount of $110,000, which they
have received. They have, then, received twice the
amount reported by Major Hawkins as an ample
indemnity—more than twice the amount which the
Committee on Ways and Means in 1824 decided
to be a reasonable compensation for all their losses
of personal property, as well as the country taken
from them in settling the boundary.
The claim for the land which these Indians allege
was taken by General Jackson, in making the
treaty, so far as I understand, was never presented
to this Government until the present Congress. It
never was relied upon, except as an argument when
they asked for additional compensation for losses
of personalaproperty. I think, then, that the
reason why it never was presented was this: The
Indians well understood that the whole subject
was adjudicated and passed upon, in settling for
the losses of personal property, and therefore the
claim on account of land was never urged as an
original, distinct claim.
It is true that there is one portion of the report
- of Colonel Hawkins, which throws some obscurity
over this subject. He says that, at the time of the
running of this boundary line, the Indians would
have been willing to have taken sixty thousand dol-
lars, but the whole report taken together shows that
h« recommended a compensation in money, and
included the amount of it in his estimate, which has
already been twice paid. But if there be any
claim at all for land thus taken from the friendly-
Indians, what is the measure of damages? Un-
doubtedly $60,000, the value of the lands at the
time; but as they have never presented a claim until
now, there is no principle which, with reference
to the practical settlement of claims, would entitle
them to any back interest, and still less is there
any principle wliich would authorize tliem to come
forward and claim for the present value of the land,
as augmented by time and the progress of settle-
ment. 1 nm informed that this country is so poor,
that even now the land could not be Bold for twenty
cents per acre, the compensation now proposed to
them. What was the equity of the case at the
timeof making the treaty, touching the lands taken
from the friendly Indians ? The title, so far as we
can judge, was m the tribe generally.
But passing over that, and admitting that the
right to this portion of the land was exclusively
in the friendly Creeks, what was the reason as-
signed by General Jackson for taking these lands?
It was, that it was as necessary for the Indians as
it was for this Government, that they should be
separated from what was then British possessions,
in order that they might be free from the inter-
ference and tampering of British agents, which
had before led to insurrection, war, and collision,
and which would produce the destruction of the
tribe itself. It was, as he said,as much for the in-
terest of the Indians as of this Government.
But General Jackson did not take the country
upon that ground alone. He said to them, " I
give you in exchange for the land I have thus
taken from you the country between the rivers
Coosa and Tallapoosa." It is true the friendly
Indians asked, where shall the hostile Indians go?
He answered them that there was room enough
to take them among themselves.
Now, the extent of that country, as shown by
the letter which 1 have in my hand, from the Com-
missioner of Indian Affairs, was about three mil-
lions of acres.
General Land Orrics, January 31,1853.
Sib : In reply to your verbal inquiries of this date, rela-
tive to the lands situated between the Coosa and Tallapoo-
sa rivers, I have the honor to state that it appears the por-
tion situated between the limits of Georgia was ceded, with
certain other lands, by the Creek treaty concluded Novem-
ber 15,1827, and the portion in Alabama by the treaty of
March 24,1832, which ceded all their remaining lands in
that State. The proportionate cost of the lands between
the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers is estimated as follows:
Part situated in Georgia 400,000 acres, at three and a half
cents per acre  $14,000
Part situated in-Alabama 2,600,000 acres at thirty-
six cents per acre -  936,000
Total    $950,000
It must be remarked that the above is only an approxi-
mation to the truth, from such data as are within reach of
this office.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
JOHN WILSON, Commissioner.
Hon. Volnkt E. Howard, House of Representatives.
The country which General Jackson gave them
was infinitely better than that which he took from
them, and from all the information I can gain, it
was much more valuable. He gave them these
three millions of acres taken from the hostile
Creeks; it is«rue they were dissatisfied with it.
But the Commissioner states that in the subse-
quent negotiations for this country, between the
Coosa and Tallapoosa, thus given in exchange,
the Government of the United States paid the
tribes $950,000 for their cession. This shows that
the lands could not have been so small a compen-
sation, nor so improper an equivalent, as has been
represented.
I think, therefore, that in any view of the case,
that not only the whole claim was settled, but that
it was intended to be embraced in the adjustment,
and that ample compensation was received in ex-
change for the lands taken, and that therefore,
for that reason, there is no just foundation for
this claim in any sense, certainly not for the sum of
$1,769,000 now proposed to be given them.
I cannot be mistaken in reference to the under-
standing of the Indians in this matter, for it ap-
pears distinctly from the legislative reports of
1817 and 1824, and particularly from that of 1824,
that the Government then considered the whole
subject, by making appropriations to pay off the
losses of personal property.
Much nas been said of the manner in which we
have d-ealt with this tribe, and with the Indian
tribes generally. It appears in the report of Mr.
Schoolcraft, contained in the Indian Department,
that this tribe has increased in numbers during the
last fifty years. We know that but for the inter-
ference of our Go vernmen t, the Cre^k N ation would
have been utterly extinguished by its own internal
dissensions, and that tne policy pursued towards
that tribe by the United States has been eminently
just and wise. The only way for preserving them ,
was to remove them beyond the Mississippi, and
the same may be said of the other tribes. There
is not a people upon earth that is now receiving
so large a bounty from Government as the vari-
ous Indian tribes in this country. We have treaty
stipulations with one hundred and twenty-five
thousand Indians, exclusive of tribes in Texas,
Oregon, California, and New Mexico, and we are
appropriating to them annually about one million
of dollars.
I have made the following statement, by which
will be seen the amount of money we are paying
them annually, the amount paid to each tribe, and
the amount of land to which each individual of the
tribe is entitled in his new home west of the Mis-
sissippi. We have not only secured them land
in perpetuity, but we appropriate every year vast
sums, which is divided among them in part, and
the residue used in the purchase of provisions,
medicine, iron and steel, clothing, agricultural
and other implements, salt, and tobacco. There-
is for nearly every tribe not only a fund for edu-
cation, but an annuity to furnish a blacksmith and
wheelwright for the use of the tribes. The amount
of these benefits will appear from the following
statement from the official documents:
Christian Indians, number 132; permanent annuity, $400.

Now, I say that history can be searched in vain
for a parallel to the bounties bestowed upon these
people by this Government. I am for continuing
the fulfillment of all our obligations to them, for
preserving our treaties with them, and for carry-
ing out the humane policy of Mr. Monroe and
General Jackson, which, if honestly and fairly
administered, will, I believe, result in the redemp-
tion of these tribes and in their civilization.
The Creek Indians receive an annuity, not in-
cluding that for educational purposes, of $56,900;
and at this time they receive for educational pur-
poses $9,319 05, and the whole amount of land
