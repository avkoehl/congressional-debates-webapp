draught and powerful armament, capable of fallowing com-
merce inn whatever waters it may frequent, and of which
ibnr or five c,in be built and maintained in commission for
tile-cost of a single frigate or sbip-of-the-line. Twenty ef-
fective vessels of the smaller class can be built and kept at
Kea for what it would cost to build and keep at sea four or
fivevessels of the larger class. And when this fact is con-
sidered ift connection with another, that well-armed ships
of this description, traversing the high seas, visiting the
ports of remote nations, are usually, in time of peace, as
powerful,.for alUpr.Qtective and preventive purposes, as.ajiy
other, while they are useful and formidable in time of war,
the argument becomes irresistible, that we should diminish
our expenses by building smaller vessels."
If this policy of a small navy be correct, we
should act upon it.
As throwing further light on this point, let us
.compare the expenses of our Navy now with the
expenses a few years ago. In 1851-59, the Navy
coat #8,928,236; in 1852-53, it cost #10,891,639. It
now hosts #13,976,236. Why this rapid increase?
Again: the French navy, in 1857, consisted of
three hundred and fifty-three vessels, carrying ten
thousand guns, and cost $26,500,000. Our Navy
carries two thousand two hundred and forty-four
guns.
I think, therefore, it is evident we are spending
too much money on the Navy. And I think, by
changing our'policy, building smaller vessels, and
exercising a reasonable economy, we can readily
bring our expenses down to $8,000,000. I am
confirmed in this opinion by the fact, that if, six
years ago, we only spent §8,928,236, under the
unnecessary cost of large ships, we can now cer-
tainly get along with that amount by changing
our policy, and relying upon smaller vessels.
In reference to the military and naval defenses
of a country, I think the true policy is not to keep
up large armies and navies in time of peace, be-
cause the public resources are wasted before war
comes; but to have as small armies and navies as
possible, and thus preserve unimpaired the re-
sources of the country when the war arrives.
We now approach the Post Office Depart-
ment. This Department is now expending near
120,000,000', and calls on the Treasury to ad-
vance $9,000,000 for the next year. This item of
$9,000,000 is twice as much as the whole average
annual- expenditures of the Government for the
first decade, from 1790 to 1800, which were only
$4,118,593 68. It is more than the total average
annual expenses during the second decade, which
were #8,920,102 30.
I would cut this down absolutely, by increas-
ing the rates of postage, abolishing the franking
privilege, and diminishing the expenses, and thus
making the Department self-sustaining.
That the Department should be self-sustaining,
1 assume as an axiom; for, why should one man
be taxed to carry the letters of another? There
is no justice in it. Let those who send letters
pay for them. It is very convenient, doubtless,
for the merchants, literary men, and professional
men, to have the hard-working masses pay for
their letters; but it is not right. The Post Office
Department used to furnish revenue to the Gov-
ernment; saddling it on the Treasury is quite a
modern invention. It began in 1846 There are
fiv« mail lines now to the Pacific; one or two at
the most would be sufficient. Two million four
hundred thousand dollars is paid for these Pacific
mails; $400,000 would be sufficient for this pur-
pose. Here is a good place to save $2,000,000 at
one blow. Get rid of the ocean mail contracts.
Let those who do sea-service take all the postage
they can gel; no more. I say, let the Post Office
Department be self-sustaining; if it will not be,
abolish it. Let letters, like merchandise, be car-
ried by private enterprise. The service, I have
no doubt, would be well and cheaply done, for
private enterprise is always more efficient than
Government action. Indeed, when I consider
the immense patronage of this Department, as a
State-rights man, opposed to too strong a Federal
Government, I see great advantage in getting rid
of tnis patronage, and thus simplifying the Gov-
ernment. I annex a statement of the vast patron-
age of this branch of the Government:
27,977 postmasters, costing   .$2,355,000
440 route agents, costing    334,000
28 express route agents, costing  28,000
23 local agents, costing 29,989
1,404 mail messengers, costing  184,634
31 special agents, coating    73,000
Clerks, costing  918,000
Salaries in Post Office Department proper  170,000
Besides this, there are the contractors, a large
and influential body.
Before leaving this branch of the subject, I
would call attention to the fact, that the postoffiee
is a great source of revenue in Europe.
In the French post office department, the net
income in 3855 was 18,684,041 francs; in 1856 it
was 19,494,130 francs.
The statistics of the English post office de-
partment, frqm 1838 to 1851, give the following
as the net revenue:
183 8 £1,652,434 1845 £719,957
183 9  1,659.509 1846   761,982
184 0  } ,633,764 1847   825,112
184 1  500,789 1848   984,496
184-3   561.249 1849   740,429
1843   6G0i641 1850   840,787
184 4  640,217 1S51  803,898
The penny postage has occasioned a loss of
<£1,000,000 per annum.
All letters not paid in adyance are charged with
double postage.
This would be an admirable provision to adopt
into our system. Under the present law, a great
many lettersare dropped in the office, without being
naid, which occasions the Department a great
of unnecessary and unprofitable trouble, as
they have to write to the person to whom the let-
ter is directed, informing nim that a letter is in
the office for him, which he can have by inclos-
ing a postage stamp.
By carrying out the recommendations I have
made in reference to the Army, Navy, and Post
Office Department, a saving could be made of the
sum of $24,000,000.
If time would permit, I could go through with
numerous other expenditures of the Government,
and show that there was great room for reduc-
tion. That these other expenditures might be re-
duced from five to ten million dollars, I have not
the slightest doubt. But will these reductions be
made? I fear not. I have no hope of a real econ-
omy under our present system of indirect taxa-
tion, which takes the money of the people with-
out attracting their notice, and is no tax, but a
bounty to a powerful and active interest, the man-
ufacturing. When we have direct taxation; when
everybody will know precisely what he pays,
and nobody have any interest in high taxes, then,
and not till then, we will have true, earnest, sin-
cere economy. We will have a great deal of talk
about it for political effect, but ending in nothing;
pretty phrases, which cost nothing and accom-
plish nothing. But the politicians are afraid of
this question of direct taxation, because they
undervalue the intelligence of the people. I shall
reserve for another occasion what I have to say
on this subject. Direct taxation, and its twin-
sister, free trade, are steadily making progress.
There is no large party pure enough and suffi- >
ciently unselfish to inscribe these great ideas on 1
its banner. But, in the fullness of time, I antici-
pate for these ideas a favorable reception by the
people.
Certain gentlemen on this floor and elsewhere,
who desire a modification of the tariff in the in- |
terests of protection, are clamorous against our j
present system of ad valorem duties, and wish to !
substitute specific duties. I propose now to con- j
sider this question. I object to specific duties, !
which I regret to say are recommended by the
present Executive.
1. They are too convenient an instrument of
the protective policy. While an advalorem duty of
fifty, sixty,seventy-five,oronehundred percent,
for protection, would shock the justice of any fair-
minded person, a specific duty of the same or
greater amount, from its hidden charactcr, would
not excite attention. If the purpose be to give the
greatest amount of protection in the most covert
way, then specific duties are to be preferred.
2. Specific duties are more difficult to adjust
than ad valorem duties. Under the ad valorem sys-
tem, you have nothing to do but determine the
value, the rate of duty being certain; but under
specific duties, it is difficult always to determine
the class to which the article belongs. In proof
of this, the cases of contest arising under specific
duties have been more numerous than under ad
valorems, and the litigation in the courts has also
been greater.
3. There is greater opportunity for mistake and
fraud under specific duties than ad valorems, be-
cause, under the ad valorem system, the dutiable
articles pass under the inspection of a variety of
officers, thecollectors,appraisers, examiners, &c.;
whereas, under specific, the dutiable articles pas^
into the hands of one individual, as the weigher,
gauger, or measurer, and such officer makes his
estimate of the .duties due, without superior su-
pervision. Under the ad valorem system, the at-
tention of the custom-house official is sharpened
by the forfeiture which may accrue; whereas this
is not the case under specific. With a bonus to
the officer, in case of forfeiture for under-valua-
tion, the law provides a safeguard against fraud,
which does not exist under the opposite system.
4. Specific duties practically operate, m gen-
eral, greatly to enhance the rate of duty, espe-
cially on manufactured articles, because of the
fall in price of such articles, which has been stead-
ily going on for many years. To illustrate tins
idea, I would call attention to the following ex-
hibit, showing the fall n various manufactured
articles, from 1835 to 1849:

This remarkable fall in the price of manufac-
tured articles is owing to the vast improvements
and inventions in machinery, for winch our cen-
tury is so distinguished, and which are constantly
taking place.
From this exhibit, taken by me from the re-
turns of the Secretary of the Treasury in 1849,
which I regret not being able, from the pressure
of my avocations, to bring down to the present
time, the operation of the principle I have re-
ferred to will manifestly appear. It is thus appa-
rent that the constant tendency of specifics, as to
a largo class of articles, is to an ascending scale.
The result is, they are apt to become too high, if
not entirely prohibitory; thus necessitating peri-
odical revisions of the tariff. I consider this an
insuperable objection to specifics, because they
operate against the tax-payer and in favor of the
Government. It is not surprising, therefore, as
we are assured by the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr.
Stanton,] that "France, Spain, Belgium, the
German Customs Union, Austria, and Russia,
levy specific duties exclusively." Specifics are
the duties of anti-popuiar Governments, for they
are convenient dodges to wring: from the totihig
millions their hard earnings. It is this very sys-
tem of specific duties which has enabled the mon-
archies of Europe to raise such vast- sums from
their subjects to waste in vain-glorious wais and
selfish extravagance. For the same reason that
kings prefer specific duties, monopolists prefer
them, because they can easier fill their coffers
with the fruits of the people's labor. Spenfic
duties are a species of political legerdemain, by
which the many are pillaged for the benefit of the
few. And yet this is the system the gentleman
from Ohio is so much enamored of, and that he
would have us take up with! I, for one, will
have none of them. Specifics suit the genius of
monarchies; ad valorems manifest the spirit of a
republic.
5. A further objection to specific duties, which
ia of itself conclusive, is, that they are not faif,
because they are not imposed with a view to the
value of the articles in each class. For instance:
a specific duty of $10 is laid on a watch; while
some watches may be worth $20, and others f
