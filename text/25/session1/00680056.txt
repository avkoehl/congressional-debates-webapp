CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
tion      He  would  vote foi   a committee without
reference to party as a matter of policy, and he
would not pack it enhei with administration or op-
position men, but he would havt it made  up of
men of character and standing before the conntr},
so that the investigation might be impartía', and be
looked  up n by the  country as impartial       He
went for this mode of appointment of the commit-
tee, experiment as might be, and he would try the
experiment to see if it would not lead to a good re-
sult.   He again repeated that the investigation was
demanded from the extraordinary circumstances of
the cake, and he would state the reasons why, in
his opinion, it was demanded    It was an anomily
in the history of Governments of modern times,
and much more so that it should occur in the nine-
teenth century of the Christian era, that this b londa
war should cost nearly as much a  the whole war of
the revolution, when thsre have not been engaged in
it, accordingto the estimate of the most discreet pei-
sons, over two thousand Indians and negroes, and
according to the estimate of otheis not over 1,000
"We have already expended nine millions orupwards,
and are now asked for a million and a half more,
and it is estimated, that from the numbm of claims
-  hich w ill be brought against the Government, m,
consequence of it, and the number of the forces
now concentrating in that quarter, that it will cost
before it is all settled twenty millions of  dolíais
Yet notwithstanding this extraordinary expenditure,
we have never had  the first message from the Ex-
ecutive on the subject, and the special attention of
Hie House has never been called  to the subject of
this war     He looked npon it as extiaordmary,
that a Subjsct connected with such tragical incidents
and vast expenditures, should not have been worth
the notice of a special Message from the President
of the United States    Mr B   then referred to the
fact, that the Government was now concentrating
a force of the regular troops of the United States,
to  the nu Tiber ot  about four thousand men in
Florida, for the purpose of  commencing another
campaign, and calling on the States of Kentucky,
Tennessee, South   Carolina, and  Alabama,  for
volunteers, in addition to this number, which, in
all h« expected would amount to between seven,
and eight thousand men  These troops, he presum-
ed, were to march and countermarch af tei  provi-
sions more frequently than after an enemy    He
contended   that   this   was   too  great   an   army
for the occasion, and stated thatiormerly that coun-
try had been matched thiough m pursuit of a su
peiior enemy, by Tennessee troops, not e\ceedmg
two thousand in number    He contended that fault
must he somewheie, and lie s,ti ugly suspected that
it would be found  in a gieat mesure to lie wilh
the tmbeeila condition oí the national army, and
the wintofa sumcitnt number of officers, ard m
Mippeit of this opinion he referred to the condition
of the troops at the battle of the Wifhlacoochie and
Tampa Bay, about the time of the unfortunate af-
fair of Dade's command    He went tor the mves-
'igation, so that the country might know where the
blame rested, and that the officeis engaged in that
< ampaign might have justice done them
Mr WISE begged leave to make a correction as to
a matter of fact m the reports of the statement he
made to the House on yesterday in relation to the
occurrence m the committee room last winter w hich
he had spoken of It is slated in the íepoit m the
Globe, and it is substantially the same in the Intel-
ligencer, that in speaking of his friend, Col Camp-
bell, of South Carolina, he had said that lint gen-
tleman had rose from his seat, locked the door of
the committee room, put the key m hio pocket, and
swore that until the infamous falsehoods m that
report w ere expunged, no one should teat e the
room This (Mr W said) was a mistake in the
reporter He did not say tint the gentleman ae
tnilly 1 leked the door, and put the key in his pock-
el He staled that the gentleman turned to the
door and said that he it ould lock it, and would put
the key in h s pocket if the offensive parts wero not
Uneken out Sir, said Mr W it wj, not necessary
foi the gtnt'emaH to lock the door ihe thieat was
enough, it answered every puiposc
Mi GHOLSON said that he, like the gentleman
from Tennessee, (Mr Bell,) an 1 tverj other gen-
tleman who hal addressed the House, was in fa/or
of the invest gallon     He w as in favor of the m-
quiiy into eveiy thm  connected with the Honda
w ar, but he wished it instituted in accordance w ith
the usages  and  customs which had always go-
verned this House    What was the object to be
effected by the lesolnton of the gentleman from
Virginia'   It first proposed to have an investiga-
tion,  and  then proposed to have the committee
composed of what he must here teim the mmoiity
of the House, representing as they do the minority
of the people of the United States, irresponsible, as
all minorities weie    Yet th it gentleman wanted to
have a committee composed of those nresponsible
persons, to investígale that very important mattet
which had excited the interest of the country so
much     He hoped the subject would be íeferied to
the regular standing committee of the House, con-
stituted for the purpose oí taking charge of those
subjects, and he trusted they would have no more
such select committees as the tw o appointed at the
last session of Congres      He had heard a rumor
last spring in relation to the occuirence which the
gentleman had on jesterday made public, but he
had hoped, for the honor of the House of Repie-
sentatives and of the Amenean people, that it was
untitle     But the gentleman from Virginia (Mr
Wise) had  seen proper in debite to etpose the
secrets of the prison house, and lay before the world
the details of a scene which he pionounced to be a
disgrace to the Congress oí the Uni ed States    Has
it come to this, that a mere threat from a gallant
South Carolinian shall have such an effect upon a
majority of a commit'ee of the House oí Represen-
tatives of the United States, that they dare not pre-
sent a paper which they had prepared as their re-
portJ? If this was the rule by which committees were
to be governed, he thought the gentleman might not
have such scruples about sending the subject to the
Committee on Military Affans, for if the one mem
ber of the opposition should use a threat with the
same effect "which the gentleman has asserted the
ons m his committee was used, he would bring
ovei the other eight to agree with him, or at least
not to report in opposition to his views of right and
wrong    He was much obliged to the gentleman
from Vngmia for this further evidence of the man-
ner m which business was conducted before those
select committees of the last session    Who ever
heard in a deliberative body of a majouty being
told  that  the  one  who would dare  to  present
a paper containing their views, 'would be held per-
sonally responsible and that if he did not hold him-
self íesponsible, he should be chastised     Yet the
gentleman   who   makes these  disclosures  wants
another committee, and it w as to be supposed, from
Ihe part he seemed to take, that he desned a com-
mittee this time who would not be required to be
locked up in a room, and threatened with chastise-
ment, to make them make a report m apaitieular
manner    The gentlemin fiom Virginia was not
w ilhng to trust to this commdlee being composed
ol a majority of the members in favor of the admi-
nistration     If the gentleman cannot trust the ma-
jority of the  House   who   ate lesponsible  to  the
country, how can the majority trust the mmoiitv,
who aie mesponsible''    Why not have a majority
of the friends of the airmmsttation on this commit-
tee1 He had heard no one oppose this investigation,
not a single frienl of the administra ion had raised
his voice against it,  \et the moment it was intro-
duced, it called forth the most \iolent denunciations
and philipics fiom the gentleman from Virginia,
and   all   for   the   purpose   of  getting  a   majo-
rity  of  pei'ons   on   his   committee   opposed  to
the   administration    for he  cou'd  see  no   other
object  winch the gen lema n could have m\iew
than to get a ma outy of opposition nen on it, who
will report precise!) in accordance with his decla-
rations     In it'ition to trie s-er-e n the committee
room    the gentleman f\, n   Pennsylvania,  (Mr
Muhlenberg,) had told us that the paper neici was
read before the majonlj of the ci mmittee, until it
was lead m the loom, < id lhat the moment it was
read, they stated tl ej won d not agree to it, yet not
satisfied with tn s   the minonty had to ¡eso t to
threats to make them  expunge  their íeport m the
shortest time possible     He considered that those
scenes m theseblacic holes of the Capitol would
dimmish the respect which the people entertained
for the Congress of the United States, and it was a
lesson for them not to raise committees of this kind
It was the legitimate business of standing commit-
tees to investigate matters of this kind, and provide
the proper remedj We have heard a great deal
about the clerk of the committee writing the report,
and the insinuation that the majority were not able
to write it. Now he looked upon it as an imma-
terial matter, as to who the scribe was that drew
up the report, when tne materials were furnish-
ed by the majority of the committee, and they
adoped it as their own, and were íespon i le
for the facts It only showed, however, that
there was a party in the House who laid
claim to all the talent and all the de-
cency As to what would have been the fate of
the íeport of the m íorily, that is the report ot the
o-enti^man from Virginia himself, if it had been
íead in committee, and the members of the majo-
rity had been ac couiageous as the gallant South
Carolinian, we know not It is possible that the
power of a threat might have operated somewhat
on that report
Mr LINCOLN stated that The report of the mi-
nority of the committee was read in the committee
room in presence of all the members, and signed
by the three members of the minority
Mr GHOLSON only spoke on author ty of the
gentleman from Virginia He had staled that his
report was not read in the committee room, and it
was of his report that he had spoken Mr G
would support the motion of the gentleman from
Marj land to send the subject to the Committee of
Military 4ffairs Although he was a membei of
that committee, he did not know what were the
sentiments of its members, as they had had no
matter referred to them at the present session, and
had held no meetings He then replied to the
lemarksof the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mi
Cushmg) in relation to the sympathy which that
gentleman had expressed for the savages of Flori-
da, and the denunciations he had made of the
course of policy pursued by the Government, and
pointed out the -extraordinary difficulties and dis-
adt antages under which our troops had labored
in that country, and concluded by saying that all
he asked was a fair and impartial in\ estigation oí
the matter.
Mi CAMPBELL said he should not have
arisen to address the House, had not allusion
been made m the debate upon this subject to a
gentleman to whom he bore a near relation [He
alluded to Gen Campbell of South Carolina J
He did not rise to defend that gentleman, because
he required no defence, but he would now state to
the House that he believed that gentleman enter-
tained the most kind feelings tow ards all the mem-
bers of the majority of the select committee of the
last session, and he imputed no dishonorable mo-
tives to the majority in consequence of the report
referred to He had heaid that gentleman speak
of the members of the majouty of lhat committee
in the highest terms Mr C sincerely regretted
that this unpleasant subject should be introduced
before the House, and he hoped it might not again
be a'luded to, unless it was relevant to the
matter under debate With regard to the re-
solution, he hoped the mquuy might be had,
but he was perfectly indifferent as to the man-
ner in which it should be had He cared not
whether the object was attained through a se ect
committee, or through the regular standing com
mittee of the House Our generals in Honda had
not added to then laurels any of the e ergreens
