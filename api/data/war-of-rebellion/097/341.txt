DABNEY'S MILL, March 31, 1865-9.10 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

I wish you would send out some cavalry to Dinwiddie to see if information can be got from Sheridan. It will only take about half the time to go from your headquarters it will from mine, and I have on one to send.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

DABNEY'S MILL, March 31, 1865-9.45 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

If you can orders to Mackenzie to move his cavalry to the support of Sheridan, by way of the Vaughan road, do so. I have sent the same directions to General Ord. Please let me know when Griffin gets started. If he pushes promptly I think there may be a chance for cutting up the infantry the enemy have intrusted so far from home. Urge prompt movement of Griffin.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

DABNEY'S MILL, March 31, 1865-9.45 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

Ord has driven in the enemy's pickets and sharpshooters near Hatcher's Run and got possession of a knoll which takes the enemy's works on Humphreys' right in reverse. He is building a battery there to-night. This will drive the enemy out and give Humphreys an opportunity of advancing his right and possibly of gaining a position which will take the works north of the run in reverse so as to let Ord through. Humphreys has been notified of this, but has no orders.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865-9.45 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Would it not be well for Warren to go down with his whole corps and smash up the force in front of Sheridan? Humphreys can hold the line to the Boydton plank road and the refusal along it. Bartlett's brigade is now on the road from J. Boisseau's running north, where it crosses Gravelly run, he having gone there down the White Oak road. Warren could move at once that way and take the force threatening Sheridan in rear, or he could send one division to support Sheridan at Dinwiddie and move on the enemy's rear with the other two.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
