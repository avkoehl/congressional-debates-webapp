HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION,Petersburg, Va., November 1, 1864.

LIEUTENANT: A deserter who came in on Ransom's line reports the Fifth Army Corps on the City Point Railroad last night, about a mile in rear of the enemy's line in front of my left. Whether it is there to remain or to move farther last night he does not know. Previous to the last movement on our right troops were assembled at some point and moved to the point of attack. Among their soldiers there is some rumor of a purpose to break our line and enter Petersburg. The point at which this was spoken of was about four miles from the Appomattox toward the enemy's left. The forces on the enemy's front line have, some of them, been relieved by troops of the same army corps - the Second. The deserter was of the Second Corps and was in the fight at Burgess' Mill. He says they suffered heavily; that our troops would have completely whipped them had they pressed on. They withdrew because they were so roughly handled, and because they felt that they could not hold their position.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted: Elliott's brigade, wounded, 2 (1 mortally). Wise's brigade, wounded, 1. Gracie's brigade, wounded, 1; killed, 1.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.

Lieutenant MCWILLIE, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
