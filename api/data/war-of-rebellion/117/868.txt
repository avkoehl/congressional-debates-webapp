Richmond, Va., August 31, 1862.

Captain N. MONTGOMERY, Belle Isle.

CAPTAIN: There will be an additional number of prisoners here by to-morrow - about 2,000. This will make it necessary to extend your lines. Have you men enough? If not let me know how many more you want; also how many more tents. I shall send you to-morrow 100 guns.

Very respectfully,

H. WIRZ.
