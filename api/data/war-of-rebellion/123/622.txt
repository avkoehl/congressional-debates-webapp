GENERAL ORDERS, WAR DEPT., ADJT. GENERAL'S OFFICE, Numbers 146. Washington, September 30, 1862.

No officer will hereafter be relieved from his command and sent to report in this city without the authority of the War Department. Where subordinate officers are guilty of military offenses, or are negligent, or incompetent, it is the duty of the commander to have them tried for their offenses, or examined in regard to their incompetency, by a proper court or commission, and this duty cannot be evaded by sending them to Washington. Hereafter officers so sent to headquarters will be immediately ordered back, and those who send them will be deemed guilty of disobedience of orders.

By command of Major-General Halleck:

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.
