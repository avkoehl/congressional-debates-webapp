APPENDIX, TO THE CONGRESSIONAL ©IíOBE.
25th Cong....3d Sess.
Graduation Bill—Mr. Benton, Mr. day, of Kentucky.
i SjfcMSE 
ated on from the commencement of the Govern-
ment to this time The system was to continue
the same, and the price of the refused lands alone
was to be affected. Speculation! speculation'
This is the raw head and bloody-bones forever
held up Happily, we have got some examples to
give, and happily the system of graduation has
been tried—tried in the most delightful part of the
United States—tried on an extensive scale, and
with the most happy results In all that part of
the State of Mississippi acquired by treaty from
the Chickasaw Indians, the system was estab-
lished by the Indians themselves, and experience
had shown that it had operated in the most bene-
ficial manner, both for the Indians and for the
Slate These lands were to be sold by the Indians
for their own benefit
Mr. B here read from the treaty of 1831 with
the-Choctaws, the scale of graduation, as follows
"The lands, as surveyed, shall be offered at
•  public sale, at a price not less than one dollar and
' twenty five cents per acre, and thereafter for one
' year, those which aie unsold, and which shall
*  have been previously offered at public sale, shall
' be liable to private entiy and sale at that price.
« Thereafter, and for one year longer, they shall
' be subject to entry and private sale at one dollar
' per acre Thereafter, and during the third year,
' tbley-shall be subject to sale and entry at fifty
• cents/ per acre. Thereafter, and during the fourth
' year, at twenty five cents per acre, and afterwards
* at tuietve and a half cents per ac  e "
And moreover these Indians had provided for
the abandonment of their refuse lands after four
years, while the United States have been hanging
on to these lands, which were subject to gratuitous
gift by the Spanish Government And now what
was the effect of this system > The objection made
to this bill is that nobody will buy the lands at the
present minimum price because they will prefer to
wait until the next year, when they will come
down to the first graduation of one dollar, and then
that nobody will buy at the graduated price of one
dollar, because they will prefer waiting another
year for them to come down to the lowest price
of <eventy~1ive cents By this argument, futile
«ad weak as it was, and which no one ever gave
a moment's consideration to, nobody would buy
the Chickasaw lands till they fell to twelve and a
half cents. Such an argument was contradicted
by reason and experience. Who ever believed
that a man would risk the loss of the lands he
wanted by waiting a whole year for the sake of
saving twenty-five or fifty cents an acre} Mr B
then went on to show the progress of the sales
made of the Chickasaw lands, by which it ap-
peared that at three differentpnces they sold much
faster than the lands of the United States The
sales were now going on rapidly at fifty cents,with-
out waiting till the next year, when they would be
at wenty-five cents In short (said Mr B ) all the
land that was worth #I 25 sold at that pi ice, with-
out the purchasers waiting another year for it to
fall. All the land that was worth one dollar, ajso
sold at that price, without waiting for it to fall to
fifty cents; and so, also, was the case with the
land that was worth fifty and twenty-five cents
Now did not this show the wisdom of these Chick-
asaws' and ought we not to profit by their ex-
ample and experience'' Are we not daily taunted
with the wants of the Treasury > Have we not
been compelled to issue Treasury notes, which
are, so far as creditors are concerned, nothing but
a forced loan > Can we not (said he) avail our-
selves of the wisdom of these Chickasaws, and
sell our refuse lands for what they are worth, and
by this means replenish our exhausted Treasury?
It was m thiB view that the Committee on Finance
had made a report, recommending the passage of
this bill as a revenue measure, and he deemed it
fortunate for the country that they had these re-
fuse lands. Mr B referred to the operations of
the compromise bill, and the rate at which it was
bringing down the receipts from the customs
And what, he asked, had the scheme for prevent-
ing the sales of the refuse lands for its object > It
was to cripple the Treasury, so that by the year
1842, when the compromise bill had been worked
out, there would be a triumphant argument m favor
of an increase of the tariff We are for supplying
the wants of the Treasury from the proceeds of
these waste lands, thereby preventing the necessity
of recurring again to a high tariff What did the
gentlemen propose, who wish to prevent us from
selling these lands? Did they mean that the
Treasury shall go down to ten or twelve millions,
and make this the first step m the march m the
return to the old tariff? He considered this move-
ment as step number one, in the system heretofore
to be developed forthe revival of thetanff, and he
wished all those gentlemen who come from that
quarter of the Union, which for all the purposes
of exaction, is the Asia of America, and where the
great land holders are not nabobs, but the Zemin-
dars, who merely hold the title to the land, but
yield up the proceeds to lords paramount. Upon
our conduct with regard to these lands depends
what will be their conduct with regard to the
unjust duties The Treasury will be thrown upon
the cotton, the rice, and the tobacco of the South;
and he asked the gentlemen who came from that
portion of the country which grows these products,
to consider well what they do, when they come to
record their votes
This question presented itself in several aspects,
several of which he had briefly touched on,
another view of the subject was, that it was but an
act of mere justice to the new States that the re-
fuse lands lying in them should be converted into
private property, that they may be subject to tax-
ation, and thus contribute to the support of the
State governments, instead of their being, as now,
under the barren scepter of the Federal Govern-
ment. Here were seventy-one millions of acres,
enough, if united, to form two new States, and
yet the States, in which it is dispersed, are not
allowed to tax them Was not this an act of
injustice to the new States, and m violation of
the compact entered into with them' Was it not
plainly, in the fair construction of the compact,
that these lands were to be sold, and not held up
by keeping on them an arbitrary price, for all of
them, good, bad, and indifferent? Was it not, in
the fair construction of the compact, that the
Federal Government shall sell these lands, and,
in order to sell them, must they not offer them at
a price at which they will sell > The new States
were unjustly treated, in being obliged to lose the
amount they ought to be receiving from the taxa-
tion of them, without taking into consideration the
great loss to their agricultural industry, by keep-
ing them waste and unproductive.
Mr B referred to the emigration to Missouri
The largest emigration that had ever taken place
to his State, was that of the last year, and all the
emigrants went on to the new lands, where they
could get first choices at $1 25 per acre, because
they could not give that sum for picked-over lands
m the old counties
Mr B , after describing the manner m which
very small portions of good land is mixed up with
large poition«i of indifferent land in the old coun-
ties, recapitulated his argument in favor of selling
these waste lands for the supply of the Treasury,
in order to avoid a recurrence to a high tariff,
loans, or, what was worse, to a new issue of
Treasury notes.
Mr CLAY, of Kentucky, would make a few
remarks in reply to the Senators from Mississippi
[Mr. Walker] and from Alabama, [Mr Clay ]
From the course of the Senator from Alabama, in
directing remarks against him personally, rather
than to the subject before the Senate, it might be
thought that he was actuated by some secret grief,
some private animosity He asks, why was this
amendmentnot proposed at an earlier stage of this
bill? Did it not occur to that Senator that this
was the first opportunity that he (Mr C ) had of
presenting it ? This bill was brought up suddenly
and unexpectedly to him at the beginning of the
session, and the Senate agreed to postpone it at
his request It again came up during *e Christ
mas holidays, and was postponed until Monday
last At some personal inconvenience to myself
I attended the Senate on that day, prepared to dis-
cuss the measure, but it was not called up by its
friends, so that the Senate will see that this is the
first opportunity which has been presented of
offering the amendment But the Senator from
Alabama, not content with the charge of endea-
voring to defeat the bill by procrastination,says I
have always shown myself the enemy of the new
States. The Senator ib more anxious to impress
this idea on the new States, than he is eo v,u céil
of the truth of it. The charge is not only wholly
unfounded in reference to my selft but is also sto m
respect to the action of this Government, wfctck,
so far as regards the new States, has been emi-
nently paternal Look at the munificent grants
to several of these States, and to Alabama—one-
thirty-sixth of the public lands granted for the
purposes of education, and other large and liberal
grants for roads and other purposes,-and y'et we
are to be taunted with the ilhberality of our politíy
towards the new States
Mr C said his language respecting the pre*
emptioners had been distorted or nuseepresented.
He had been charged with having indulged ¡a op-
probrious terms towards this class, which he had
never used He was opposed now as then to tfafe
preemption law, not because he was opposed to
the settlement and occupancy of the public «tomara*
but because it was an appropriation to these indi-
viduals of a public and general property.
The Senator from Mississippi proposes a coren
Eromise, he asks me, will I vote in favor of th*
ill in case the amendment I propose will be
adopted The Senator has no right to ask this
question. The bill is open to amendment by any;
Senator, and I will only say that if compelled to
take the bill as offered by the committee, or ihm
bill with the proposed amendment, I would, m*
finitely prefer the amended bill TheSenatoraays
there will be no necessity for this restriction 5 that
the bill already limits the amount to one section
for each applicant. Why, sir, there are forty
land offices, a man has twelve children or twenty
friends, and he can enter a section for eaeit at
them It is also said that the restriction is op*
pressive and unjust, that the owner of contigueeil
lands who may want more land for timber or foi
stone, cannot acquire it Not so, he can purchase
it, but not at the reduced price—he can get it foi
$1 25 per acre We are told that it is necessary
these lands should be forced into market to supply
the wants of the Government He thought it sur-
prising that gentlemen friendly to the Administra-
tion should place the Government in the position
of a spendthrift or prodigal heir, who, after having
squandered away all his ready means, was forced
to dissipate his patrimony to supply his wants or
his extravagance.
But we have a document on our table which has
been quoted to prove the piopnety of this measure!
but really he could not see anything in it which
was of much consequence, for there was about «a
much against the measure as in favor of it. But
he would call the attention of the Senate to the
manner in which this document was placed before
us. A Senator goes to a clerk in the Treasury
Department, and makes a verbal requisition for so
much information, to be furnished at a certain
hour, and when the information is ready, ha
desires it may be sent to another Senator. Well,
the result is the document before us, which par-
takes of the peispicuity and lucidnees which char-
acterizes all the papers that proceed from the de-
partment of the modern Turge. How different is
this procedure from the course which the Senate
formerly took, when they were governed by con-
siderations of correctness, order, and, he would
add, if he thought it was properly appreciated, of
dignity
We have also held up to us for imitation a
graduation scheme in operation m Mississippi,
which somebody, three or four years ago, intro-
duced into an Indian treaty for the puipose, he
supposed, of making an "experiment," and
probably as a precursor to the plan, on a grander
scale, which we have now before us. [Mr
C heie went into an examination of the results of
the sales of lands under the treaty with the Chick-
asaws, and contended that they were unfavorable ]
It will be seen that these lands are liable to ba
graduated down to twelve and a half cents per
acre, and there is no doubt, if the bill before us—
this entering wedge—is successful, that the pub-
lic lands of the United States will be eventually
reduced to the same price
In conclusion, Mr C would again say, that rf
compelled to vote for a bill unrestricted or one
restricted in its provisions, he would minutely
prefer the latter.    He had already tecJtamed
