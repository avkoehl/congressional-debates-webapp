HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,November 28, 1864.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Commanding Second Corps:

GENERAL: Before forwarding the accompanying communication* to headquarters Armies of the United States, the commanding general desires that General Gibbon have an opportunity of perusing the indorsement thereon. Will you, therefore, please send the letter to General Gibbon for that purpose? The regard the commanding general has for General Gibbon, and the sense he entertains of the services rendered by that officer, causes him to view, with regret, his application to be relieved from his command; and supposing that the application may have been presented without a careful consideration of all the circumstances attending the assignment of which he complains, you are authorized by the commanding general to say to General Gibbon that in case he now wishes to recall his request to be relieved an application to that effect will be favorably considered.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. SECOND ARMY CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,November 28, 1864.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: As the best mode of conveying to General Gibbon the contents of your note respecting his application, I sent it to him, together with his indorsed application, accompanied by a personal note. I return you herewith the original application of General Gibbon and his reply, and am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
