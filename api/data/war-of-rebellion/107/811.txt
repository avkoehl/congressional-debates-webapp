Brigadier General A. PLEASONTON.

Barnesville:

Exercise your own judgment about moving to Hyattstown. The movements of Generals Burnside, Sumner, and Franklin, ordered this morning, are suspended. General Burnside last night sent out scouts to Ridgeville and to within three miles of New Market. They only saw a few pickets of the enemy, and were told that Stuart's cavalry occupied New Market: that the main body of the enemy was at Frederick still. This information you will observe differse somewhat from yours. Burnside makes another reconnaissance in force to Ridgeville this morning.

P. S. - Supplies of provisions will probably reach the mouth of Seneca Creek to-day by canal.
