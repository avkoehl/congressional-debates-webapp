HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTH KANSAS,Paola, Kans., May 4, 1864

Captain J. L. THOMPSON,

Co. B, 15th Kansas Vol. Cav., Coldwater Grove, Kans.:

CAPTAIN: Colonel Moonlight sent your orders by the patrol from Mound City to-day to organize an expedition to go into Missouri, but from information received since the order was sent it is deemed best for you not to go at present. Hence you will not move as directed by the order from Colonel Moonlight until you hear further from him.

By order of Brigadier-General McKean:

GEORGE S. HAMPTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MACKEY'S SALT LICK, C. N., May 4, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS,

It is certain that Quantrill, with over 80 men, has gone north. He crossed the Arkansas River west of Fort Gibson on the 21st. His destination was Kansas and Missouri. If pressed too hard it was his intention to disband his men, that they may make their escape out of the country across the plains to the gold mines and other places. He was driven out of Texas by the rebels for indiscriminate murder and robbery. I am water-bound, and cannot tell when I will get to Leavenworth.

JAS. G. BLUNT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF COLORADO,Denver, Colo., Ter., May 4, 1864

Honorable JAMES H. LANE,

U. S. Senate, Washington, D. C.:

Rumored that Colorado will be taken from Department of Kansas and put in Department of New Mexico. See about it quick. If so, stop it. Don't fail. Answer how it is.

J. M. CHIVINGTON,

Colonel, Commanding District of Colorado.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE NORTHWEST,Milwaukee, Wis., May 4, 1864

General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff of the Army, Washington, D. C.,:

GENERAL: I have the honor to transmit for your information copy of a letter* from General Sibley, covering a report from Major Brown, stationed on the Minnesota frontier. From that report you will perceive that 200 lodges (about 600 warriors) of the Sissetons and other bands of Minnesota Sioux have surrendered to the U. S. forces. I have instructed General Sibley in the event of this surrender to locate the Indians at Devil's Lake, near the military post
