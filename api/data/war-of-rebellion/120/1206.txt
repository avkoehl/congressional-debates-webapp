STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Columbia, December 8, 1864.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON, Secretary of War:

SIR: In accordance with your suggestion in your letter of the 31st of August last, I have this day ordered the negro prisoners in the custody of the sheriff of Charleston District to be turned over to General Sam. Jones, commanding. A few of them, it is supposed, may be slaves, but the State had no means of identifying them or their masters. I have inclosed to General Jones the evidence from which it is supposed that some of them may be slaves, and I make this communication as information to yourself.

Very respectfully, yours,

M. L. BONHAM.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
