CAPE GIRARDEAU, April 28, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING:

Your dispatch to commanding officer at Bloomfield cannot be forwarded. The line is down. He has already received similar orders from me. Shall they be sent by courier? Do you desire him to report directly to you, as indicated in your dispatches, or through these headquarters as heretofore?

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.

PATTERSON, April 28, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING, Commanding:

I can be ready to march my command in one hour. I have no transportation here for camp equipage. We can only cross Saint Francis River by swimming, and it would be difficult to get to Bloomfield on account of high water.

JAMES WILSON,

Major, Commanding.

PILOT KNOB, MO., April 28, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING, Commanding, Saint Louis:

The command at Patterson cannot get to Bloomfield. I will send Colonel Matthews from here to Bloobfield. He can get there sooner and will thus evade the large streams, and his men in this command are acquainted with the country there. If this meets with your approval, please answer immediately.

J. F. TYLER,

Colonel, Commanding.

PILOT KNOB, April 28, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING:

I shall order Lieutenant-Colonel Matthews to Bloomfield, with four companies, and draw in the Centreville command. Troops can get to Bloomfield from here better than from Paterson. Troops from here will somewhat avoid the lakes and will get on the east side of Saint Francis River, which Major Wilson cannot cross for two or three days yet. Please answer immediately.

J. F. TYLER,

Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant H. HANNAHS, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have been thinking of asking permission to order in the company at Centreville. The only good it does there is to stand i s to stand on the right flank of Patterson and act as a feeler for this post, which probably could be accomplished by scouting well. I will order it in, which your permission. There are scarcely any people there worth of protection. Rebels will hurt them, hence Union men have no use for them.
