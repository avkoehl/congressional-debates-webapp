SPECIAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,
Numbers 407. ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, September 10, 1863.

I. Brigadier General Alexander Asboth, U. S. Volunteers, is hereby assigned to the command of the Military Prison, Alton, III.

By command of Major-General Halleck:

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SEPTEMBER 10, 1863.

General McPHERSON,

Vicksburg:

The enemy can ford Big Black anywhere above Birdsong's. They are burning cotton and destroying property, and I don't think it is any of our business to protect those people. They deserve little help at our hands. Indeed the rebels are serving our cause in making the people of Mississippi hate their rule. I want the people to feel that their rebel authorities care but little for them.

I can make them evacuate that country by marching on Canton, but don't see why I should march our infantry this hot weather to help a parcel of people who are not our friends of even allies. When these people act as friends and offer to help, I will respond.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

SEPTEMBER 10, 1863.

General OSTERHAUS,

Black River Bridge:

I am sure the enemy's cavalry is dispersed from Yazoo City to Rodney. I only await General Grant's return from New Orleans to disturb their calculations. Tell your scouts to watch for the first symptoms of an infantryman, or an artillery gun. The more secesh cavalry traverse Mississippi, and the more cotton they burn, the more will the people be willing to see them depart. I want Jackson's cavalry to disgust the people of Mississippi east of Big Black, and the very minute we want, we can send all their detachments kiting east of the Pearl.

Is there a road from the bridge direct to Old Auburn? Or to reach Auburn would we have to go to Edwards' Depot?

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

September 10, 1863.

General OSTERHAUS:

I know pretty well the disposition of the secesh cavalry. There are only two regiments at Clinton and south of it. The heaviest force is from Vernon to Yazoo City.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
