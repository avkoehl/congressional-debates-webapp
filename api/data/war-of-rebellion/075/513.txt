HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,June 18, 1864.

Major-General HOWARD:

Your report of 10.50 [10] a. m. is very satisfactory. Do not lose your connection with Palmer or Hooker unless you find your flanks protected by bad ground, or that the enemy is actually retired. In the latter case send word immediately to Hooker and Palmer, and press the enemy with your infantry, whilst you give him as many shells from your artillery as the batteries can throw. General Sherman is at last very much pleased. Our consciences approve of our work and I hope all will go right.

Very respectfully,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,Near Marietta, Ga., June 18, 1864-6 a. m.

Major-General STANLEY,

Commanding First Division:

You will at once move to Marietta. General Wood's division will follow yours, and Newton's Wood's.

By order of Major-General Howard:

J. S. FULLERTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Corresponding orders to Generals Newton and Wood.)
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,June 18, 1864-6.30 p. m.

General NEWTON,

Second Division, Fourth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Between the right of your main line and the left of General Wood's skirmish line the connecting line of skirmishers has no protection. Please instruct that barricades be erected in front of the same to-night. General Thomas proposes that General Baird may make lodgment opposite his (Baird's) front, and he wishes me to place a battery in position near Harker's line enfilading the enemy's line. As this is just where I had indicated it this afternoon I will merely ask you to have the works constructed for at least four guns.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

JUNE 18, 1864-11.45 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

GENERAL: On reaching the lines I found Howard commencing a movement to his front and left. He has advanced perhaps half a mile on his left, and I should judge on right a mile. Baird and King are moving with him, and unless you disapprove it, I will advance my whole line.

J. M. PALMER,

Major-General.
