Captain ADRIAN TERRY, Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that the position of the reserves of my command remains the same as at my last report, no changes having been made in their disposition during the last twenty-four hours. The first line of battle in my front is manned as before, by two officers and fifty men; the second line of battle to which the force except one-tenth were withdrawn was extended from the right and left last night about 100 yards to the right and a little more to the left, connecting on the right and left with the First and Second Brigades. The enemy have been at work on their batteries. I opened the Requa guns on a fatigue party, which at once caused a suspension of work. A musketry fire was kept up all last night by the enemy. No casualties have been reported.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
