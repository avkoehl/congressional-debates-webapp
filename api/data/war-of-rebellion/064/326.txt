Colonel J. B. ROGERS,

Cape Girardeau:

Captain Shibley and Lieutenant Byrne and Toney have returned, without meeting with the guerrillas who killed Hazel.

A few guerrillas tried to bushwhack Byrne's forces yesterday, and he killed 2 of them. Last night the guerrillas killed Dr. Sutton, at Clarkston, mistaking him for one of our men.
