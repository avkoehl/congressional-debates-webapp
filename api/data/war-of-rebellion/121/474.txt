Numbers 62. Washington, April 7, 1865.

Concerning declarations of exchange of prisoners.

Announcements having been made by commanding generals that certain prisoners of war were "declared duly exchanged," to correct a misapprehension upon this subject the following is made known as the proper course in all cases:

A declaration of exchange can only properly emanate from the office of the Adjutant-General of the Army. Whenever commanders are authorized to make exchanges their authority is confined to delivering prisoners of war and receiving others as equivalents. They should then furnish the Commissary-General of Prisoners with lists of all persons thus received and delivered, upon which the order declaring the exchange will be issued by the Adjutant-General. Such lists should be full as to names, rank, place of capture, and place of delivery.

Adjutant and Inspector General C. S. Army:

GENERAL: I ascertained from inquiry that the possession of most of the prison buildings at this place, with one exception, have been relinquished, and that the prospect is, so far as I can now estimate probabilities, that we shall need as much prison room here as during the past period. I therefore respectfully recommend that authority be given to resume, as far as is practicable, the occupancy of these prison
