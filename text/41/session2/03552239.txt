1870.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
2239
I shall not., in the few moments allowed me,
enter into any detail on the provisions of this
bill. I only wish to bring one thought into
prominence. It is a thought that should blaze
in this Hall, and refuse to hide its light until
it compelled adoption. It is reduction of tax-
ation. We are now near the close of the dis-
cussion of this bill, and I do not see that it
is lifting the weights from the shoulders of the
people as it ought. It was my purpose to
remain silent to the close, and then vote as I
thought the interests of the country required.
I have waited for some ringing voice, some
voice of influence and power, to sound the
alarm and tell this House that the burdens of
taxation must be lightened. I have frequently
assured the people that the Forty-First Con-
gress would do three things: that it would
reduce expenditures ; that it would reduce the
rate of interest on the public debt; and that
it would reduce taxation. It has already done
and is still doing the first; it is about doing
the second; and hero and now is an opportu-
nity to accomplish the third. Tt is a measure
which the people demand, one which their
necessities require ; and we shall not prove
true to the constituencies which we represent
if we return to them having made no effort to
remove the crushing burdens they bear. We
have reduced and are still reducing expendi-
tures ; let that be taken out of the taxes. We
shall reach a lower rate of interest on the debt;
let this saving be taken from the taxes. Then
let us stop so rapid a payment of the debt. _ I
know it sonnds well to say that we are paying
our debts at the rate of $100,000,000 per year;
and if the Government owned a fund on which
it. could draw at will without going to the peo-
ple I should insist on the most rapid payment
possible. But every dollar that goes into your
Treasury must first come out of' the property
and labor of the country. The Government
stands on one side, the people on the other.
If we regard the Government alone, in its
organic being, we should say that it ought to
pay its debts as fast as money could be found
to discharge them. But what effect has this
rapid payment on the people? It takes from
tltem much of their earnings. It cripples their
energies. It swallows up the products of their
industry. It retards the material progress of
the nation.
I want to see the surplus revenues dimin-
ished until $150,000,000 each year and no
more shall be applied to the payment, first of
interest, and the remainder to the payment of
the, principal of the debt. I want to see the
debt become each successive year a little less
than the preceding. It should be all the time
in the course of gradual extinction, but its
liquidation should not be so rapid as seriously
to burden the people; not rapid enough to
place fetters on the accumulation of wealth or
the increase of population. The progress of
the nation in population and wealth has been
most remarkable; remarkable both in the
rapidity and in the regularity of the progress,
the minimum rate of increase in a decade being
82.07, and the maximum rate 30.42. The last
seven decades show the following increase of
population:
Year. Population.
1790   3,922,827
180U.   5,305,937 35.02
1810   7,239,814 30.42
1820"  9,638,191 33.13
1830  12,866,020 33.49
JK4IJ    17,069,453 32.67
]H,30       23,191,876 35.87
i860:::.: 31.445,080 35.59
Taking the ratio from 1850 to 18G0 the in-
crease of population to 1900 will be as follows:
Year Population,
ISTIJ '   42,636,858
1S80   57,791,315
isgn  78.259,243
woo:::::   106,247,297
If our population in 1870 is in round numbers
40,000,000, and our debt in round numbers is
$2,500,000,000, there must be assessed against
every man, woman, andehildthesum of $02 50,
and the amount to each individual will diminish
during the succeeding decades as follows, sup-
posing the debt to remain stationary:
Amount
Year. Debt. Population, per unit of
population.
1880 §2,500,000,000 58,000,000 $43 00
1890  2,500,000,000 78,000,000 32 00
1900  2,500,000,000 106,000,000 23 58
Thus the debt will in thirty years have dimin-
ished nearly two thirds by the increase of pop-
ulation alone, for this calculation is based on
the supposition that the principal of the debt
is untouched.
Taking the regular increase of wealth as a
basis, the relative diminution of the debt is
still more striking. From 1820 to 1830 the
increase of wealth was 41 per cent.; from 1830
to 1840 the increase of wealth was 42 percent.;
from 1840 to 1850 the increase of wealth was
64 per cent.; from 1850 to 1860 the increase of
wealth was 125^,% per cent. Our total wealth
was in 1850 $7,135,780,225; our total wealth
was in 1860, $10,159,610,068.
Adopting this percentage our wealth in the
future will stand thus:
Year. Wealth.
1870 §36,593,450,585
1880  82,865,868,819
1890  187,314,353,225
1900   423,330,438,288
Hence the debt, calling it constant and giv-
ing only round numbers, will show the follow-
ing percentage in the future:
Year. Wealth. Debt. Percentage.
1870 $36,000,000,000 1 f .07 about.
1880   82,000,000,000 i r.ui (./m ] .03 about.
1890  187,000,000,000 f ^.oW.UTO.UOU -> about_
1900   423,000,000,000 J 1.005 about.
Thus in the brief space of thirty years, should
not a dollar of the principal be paid, the debt
will bear so small a proportion to our immense
national wealth that it will be almost imper-
ceptible. There can be no doubt, in the face
of these figures, of the wisdom of cutting down
the taxes, and letting the debt, in large meas-
ure, pass over to the future.
But where shall the reduction be made ? On
internal or external taxes, or on both ? And
on which of the many items of either ? 1 have
only time to ask the question. What I most
want to see is an earnest effort to reduce some-
where. Begin anywhere. We can scarcely go
amiss ; but reduce. Only let the reduction be
so made that the remaining taxes will rest on
the people with the least burden to the largest
number. In my opinion many of the articles
in the present bill should bo added to the free
list, and on others the duty should be dimin-
ished to the relief of the consumer. Salt is
one article that should be free ; and the duty
should be reduced on tea, coffee, and perhaps
sugar.
The American people are honest. They wish
to pay every dollar of their indebtedness; but
they prefer not to be crowded in the payment
of it. The security is ample; and the people
only ask that you will not hurry them, that you
will not cripple progress by excessive burdens,
that your care shaH be to "undo the heavy
burdens and let the oppressed go free."
Mr. COX. I propose to express in as con-
densed a form as possible my objections to the
bill now under discussion.
We all know that taxation in some form is
a necessity to which we must submit. All
organized communities must submit to taxa-
tion. Governments must be maintained for
the maintenance of civil order, for the protec-
tion of persons and property. They are ex-
pensive luxuries, and require large contribu-
tions from the people in the form of tax-
ation for their maintenance and support.- The
problem for the statesman to solve is, how
shall these contributions be exacted; in what
form shall the necessary taxation be imposed,
in order that it may bear most lightly upon the
people, in order that it shall take the least
amount from the earnings of labor, at the same
time supplying all the wants of the Govern-
ment '/
Upon the abstract principles of justice, I
think it will be conceded, that Governments
have power to exact contributions of money
from the people in the form of taxes, only for
their support, only for those necessary expend-
itures which the protection of the political
communities over which they preside require,
and for no other purposes whatever. And such
is the view of the exercise of the powers of
taxation which the Constitution (if reference
to that sacred document in these degenerate
days may be proper) contemplates. That in-
strument provides that—
"The Congress shall havepower to lay andcollcet
taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts
and provide for the common defense and general
welfare of the United States."
Taxes, therefore, in any form, whether direct
or internal, or by duties on imports, can con-
stitutionally be imposed only for the purposes
defined in the Constitution, to pay debts, &c.
LEGALIZED ROBBERY.
But a party exists in this country who hold
to the doctrine that the Government may do
other things under the name of taxation; that
it may levy duty on imports, not for the specific
purpose of producing revenue for the public
Treasury, buttoprotectcertain classes engaged
in particular brauches of industry. Protec-
tion means simply the power to compel the
tnass of the people to contribute to the protected
classes, bounties upon the peculiar articles which
they produce, through the instrumentality of a
tax or duty on imported articles of the same de-
scription which come in competition with the
domestic article. It is robberyin the form of
law. It is more insidious, more difficult to
be comprehended in its enormities, and more
troublesome to resist, because it is fortified and
intrenched behind the enactments of law.
This form of legalized robbery has other
defenses thrown about it which make it more
formidable and more difficult to suppress and
extirpate. It is hedged about with plausible
and captivating names, it claims to exercise
most beneficial functions. It is called " protec-
tion to American industry," and it claims to be
the great agent by which our favored Republic
is rendered independent of foreign nations. It
is my purpose to strip this system of protection
of its disguises, expose its false pretenses, and
show it up before the people of this country
in its legitimate light. I shall show it to
be a system of the most insidious and most
remorseless form of public robbery that has
ever been devised by the wit of man. It is
my design to show the farmer and the laboring
man, the classes which form the great prepon-
derating majority of the people, how they are
robbed, oppressed, and impoverished under
the name of protection to American industry.
But before proceeding to the main design of.
my argument on this occasion, 1 propose to
expose and show up some of the fallacies con-
nected with this matter of protection. A large
class of the American people have been per-
suaded to believe that a tariff is a beneficent
measure; that itpossesses some mysterious attri-
bute of good by which it is enabled to lighten
the burdens of mankind, stimulate and develop
their energies, contribute to their wealth, and
shower abundance and happiness upon them.
TARIFF—A TAX.
They seem not to be conscious that it is a tax,
and nothing but a tax; thatits very name implies
a tax, being derived from the Arabic word
d'ar{fa, which means a tax. And the word
" tariff" in our language means simply a list
of taxes or duties, and nothing more. It is
yet to be discovered that a tax is a blessing.
It may be a necessity but it is very far from
being a direct benefit. When imposed for the
purpose of supplying the actual needs of
Government, a tax may be tolerated, nay it
should be borne cheerfully. But when it is
imposed for other purposes, for instance, to
enable one class to i'ob and prey upon the
other classes, taxation becomes an unmiti-
gated and intolerable curse.
