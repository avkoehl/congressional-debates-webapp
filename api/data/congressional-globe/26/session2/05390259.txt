[Mr Wright] concedes that we owe by treaty
stipulation wuh cer ara Indian trioes, $2,300,000.
Oar Government is bound to advance the money
and vest it in annuities for their benefit, and the
convenant we have made with these poor sons of
the forest has long been in a state of infraction.
The sums we owe other tribe  augment our Indian
debt largely abave $3,000 000. The amount oi
unsatisfied balances, grow ng oat of the Florida
war, our contracts for fortificat ons, for army sup-
plies, and for numerous other objects, who at pre
sent, can number thc aggtegatc' The systsmat c

be even possible to drag on i miserable, dish > íoia-
ble existent e for another year, with tne a d of
Treasury notes, is it wise and statesman like to
do it, without creating other and permanent sources
of revenut? This respe nsibiiity cannot be post
poned much longer, and yet no legs'atnn mat
can reasonably take place at the next regular ses-
sion can provide tor it, with any piartical effect,
short of eighteen months By th" piovision ot tho
compromise act, the credit of tnree and s x months
for the principal amount of duties will continue
until July, 1S42, any which might be imposed at
the next session upon luxuries could not p< ssibly
be available sooner than the cnsuins midsummer,
and no considerable amount before the fall and
winter following. Then, postpone the action of
Congress upon this snbpct twelve months longer,
and it will thioff together upon the Treasury ail
existing unsatisfied bahneis, pnd the present
heavy deficiency m tne revenue for two jeas
The rates of duties tud Lceessanlv have to be
higher than they m e¡ht now be affixed, at, die 
must be sufficient not only for the annual expendi-
ture, but ¡or the liquidation of all the debt that
may in the mean time accumulate. But if w  pro-
ceed at once to meet the difficulties of our position,
we mitigate a ciuse thai must necessarily pro 'uce
some agitation and cha'ge in trade and business,
and there is time yet Icr reasonable notice to be
allowed to our importing merchants, before any
new law might be made to take effect Tney
could then exercise a provident foreo?st, ard
modify their importations according to the ciarge
produced by our legislation—a matter of vnai in-
terest to them, and by no means of indifference to
the country.
The necessity upon Congress  to raise more re-
venue is indisputable, «nd is daily becoming more
urgent, and now r the time, the appropriate time,
to enter upon  it    There cinnc ,  in rea   n, be
any ques.ion m rUatinn to this  asat'er,  except  a"
to the mode by which it is to b   done     There is
but a *ohtary gentleman in  the  Hou-,e who  has
proposed direct taxation, and, notwiUbtandmg it
may have   bere a   few  more  iriend ., it is  not
seriously tobe considered   It is the most expensive,
vexatious, and oppress ve f5rm of taxation     It  i
in connection with ill the habits and feelings of the
American people, and they will not and ought not
to submit to it, except in. time of wii, rr some other
extraordinary and pressing em nency    Tne with-
drawal of the deposites from the States i*, if, possi-
ble, more objectionable, b°c?use tl ¡ t roeasme was
intended pnd regarded at 'he time as but another
mode of distributing th   proceeds of the sa'es cf
the public hnds, and it was omy prej idic° a am«t

which had previously   passed   both   Hous s  oy
the most decisive majorities, an 1 its  ái< v gui h°d
author, that prevented it from being s0 in form as
wed as in substance    The money had resul el
from the sales of the land , i  of right belongei   to
the Statss, and they have so used  it     If Con„re s
were to  reclaim thee deposits, it would b    re

which they eoull not tttctrn to the Ua"cd g atlS
Treasury only by the most grievous direct taxation
up n the people Tne resort must be to the long
approved and appropriate form ot duties upon im-
portations. B,i the terms of the compromise ad,
sdks, nines, and other ancles of luxury were
nearly wholly exempted from dutie<-, because none
of them were manuiacturedor produced in the Uni-
ted States, and the chief amount of revenue ra sed

OF GEORGIA, I        f
In the House of Representatives, \fanutry 22, 1841.
On the í reasury Note bill.
Mr Chairman   I voted during thi last session
o   Congiess loi  the issae of Treasury notes    I
was then satisfied of the power of ihe Legislature
to contrac a loan upon this plan.   I am still con-
vinced of the power.   I can now see ao constitu-
tional objection to it.   Having then presented my
views upon this subject,  to mat  argument X have
nothing to ^dd, and from it nothing to subtract,    I
was willing ihen to exercise the power, avowing
íiat, becau e of the seducave, easy, and deceptive
character of this mode of raising money, it should
te reso-ted to with great care, and only in cases of
extreme «fcesmty     Such a case,  I  believed, was
th°n  prese ítetl     The  Qovernmert was, as  was
conceded o i evpry hand, upon the verge of bank-
ruptcy     S e conli not wait for any less rapid
measure of ex ruaiio"  thin the  prompt one pro-
posed     Í v as constrained to come to the rescue of
the Treasmy, and relieve it from eione ary and po-
litical dnhoior     The obligations of patriotism,
irrespective of all party views, required if    In a
like ca^e cf emergency, my conduct will be of like
character    Wheiher, tnerefoie, I shall vote for the
bill now b-5 ore t e committee, depends upon the
necessity v- neh may be shown now to exist to raioe
five mith r, of dollars at once  It is not questioned
tbat tl,e Grovm lent will need this sum in addition
io tiie 'e\u ucs which will ¿ccrue from all ordi-
nary sonáis during the year 184Í    The chairman
oi t1 e Ways and Means [Mr Jonls] admits that
tnere a ill fee a deficiency, but calls it temporary,
and assures us that it will be reimbursed m the last
quirter's income     Tne Secretary of the Treasury
takes similar ground      Indeed,  the very proposi-
tion of the officers ef finance to borrow money as-
sumes both the want and the inability of the usual
resou ces to supply i'     To justify my support,
howev r, I sha 1 lequire the gentlemen to show that
the exigencies of the Treasury  are so impenou'
that they cannot await the process of a peimanejis
