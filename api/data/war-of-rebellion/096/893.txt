HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY,March 8, 1865.

General CUSTER:

If possible, you will have all surplus saddles loaded in the wagons of the ammunition and other trains, and carried along with the command when it moves to-morrow. Leave an officer in charge of this property, and let him see that every exertion is made to transport them. If this is impossible of course they must be destroyed. I will give Captain Brown the necessary orders to furnish transportation if possible.

Very respectfully,

W. MERRITT,

Brevet Major-General.
