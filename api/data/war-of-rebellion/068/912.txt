Respectfully,

CIRCULAR.] HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, SECOND CORPS,

May 19, 1864.

A field-officer's court-martial will be convened at once in each regiment of this command for the trial of skulks and stragglers. Summary punishment should at once be inflicted on all such men. It is considered that if the full extent of punishment of a field-officer's court is inflicted, and this done at once, that it will have a beneficial effect. Sentence should be executed in presence of the command to which the person belongs. There are, in addition to loss of month's pay, punishments sanctioned by usage, such as tying up, placarding, riding wooden horses, &amp;c., that come within the authority of a field-officer's court, that would go far toward putting a stop to these crimes.

by command of Major-General Birney:

F. BIRNEY,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

NEAR SPOTSYLVANIA COURT-HOUSE,

May 19, 1864-9 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have just sent a rebel deserter, a conscript from East Tennessee see, who says they are on very short rations and that many of the conscripts have deserted. He says our cannon, killed and wounded a good many of them yesterday. He is from Hill's corps.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.
