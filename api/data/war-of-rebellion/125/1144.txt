The BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a memorandum from the President by the hands of your sub-committee in reference to furnishing the information asked by you yesterday, and which was declined by my letter to you of last evening.

Since the receipt of the memorandum from the President I have called upon and conferred with him upon the subject, and am now directed by him to inform you that in answer to your application for figures, statements, &amp;c., I have only to repeat my letter of last evening, to which I refer you.

I am, gentlemen, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.

WAR DEPT., PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S BUREAU,

Washington, D. C., February 6, 1865.

ORISON BLUNT, Esq.,

Chairman Committee Board of Supervisors,

County of New York:

Your communication of this date* has been received, asking for an opportunity to examine the records of this date and obtain such information as will enable you to test the accuracy of "the sum of the enrollment of all the districts of the loyal States, and the sum of the excess of credits in those districts, on December 31, 1864, after satisfying all calls previous to December 19, 1864."

In your communication you allege that these two numbers are assumed, and then add that the correctness of the quota of New York depends upon the correctness of these assumed numbers.

In reply I have the honor to state that "the sum of the enrollment of all the districts of the loyal States to which quotas have been assigned and which was furnished you on the 3rd instant, and which [was] correctly stated in the report of your sub-committee, and the sum of the excess of credits of these districts," which was also furnished you, are not assumed, but are the correct aggregates of the enrollment and excess of years of service.

I beg leave to inform the Board of Supervisors that, having furnished them with this information, I have the further time at my disposal to devote to this subject.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.

WAR DEPT., PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S BUREAU,

HORACE GREELEY, Esq.,

Editor New York Tribune, New York City:

SIR: I beg leave to call your attention to an editorial headed "Mr. Fry's draft," of the Tribune of Saturday last, on the subject of the assignment of the quotas under the late call.
