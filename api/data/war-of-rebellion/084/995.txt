perhaps, by Colonel S. Benavides, at whose headquarters they appear to have remained for some time. The troops reporting here for duty were raised originally for my command or for the Fourth Arizona Regiment. I do not consider the order referred to by the major-general commanding as prohibiting the reception of that class f troops. The withdrawal of exempts upon the expirations of term of service, and the absence of others without leave, have rendered it necessary to recruit some of my companies. I know of no just cause why I should be deprived of that privilege. I have directed Captain Armstrong, who left to-day in charge of the prisoners, to arrest tall of the latter class. I would respectfully suggest that the major-general commanding give him orders to facilitate the accomplishment of the object. I have now, besides the companies which disbanded and went home from the San Fernando, material for the organization of two regiments. With the recruits now on the march and being raised these regiments will be above the minimum strength. Captain Trevino's company was sent to San Antonio in obedience to orders from district headquarters and will there be filled. Accompanying is a list* of the companies, strength, &amp;c. I have instructed Captain Richardson to ascertain the parties guilty of robbery on the San Fernando. I shall report them to district headquarters and take immediate steps to have them arrested and punished. The battalions are under the command of senior captains, but under instructions from district headquarters of April 29, 1864, assurances have been given that regimental organizations would take place, everything subject, of course, to the approval by the major-general commanding. I shall, however, let the matter remain in statu quo until further orders. Charles Stillman declines filling the contract entered into with Captain King to furnish this command. Captain Merritt, assistant quartermaster,w ill soon visit district headquarters and he will explain fully. I know nothing of White's battalion. The men of Colonel Duff's regiment in Captain Giddings' command were pardoned by Colonel Latham, in pursuance of orders from district headquarters. I respectfully request further instructions concerning these men. In justice to myself I beg leave to remark that most of the men now serving with me and belonging to other commands seemed disposed not to return to their commands. I placed them on duty believing the good of the service would justify it. Some of them have acted well and have been promoted. I ask that they be allowed to remain. There are some who, if left to themselves, would return to their commands whenever ordered, but as now situated, under the influence which would be brought to bear upon them, I am confident many of them would cross the Rio Grande rather than go east. This is not the time nor the place for the execution of the order with any hope of remedying the evil. Captain Sanfort has been ordered to report, with his company, to these headquarters for duty. Concerning the cotton taken to marked by Captain Merritt, assistant quartermaster, I respectfully refer the major-general commanding to Captain M.'s letter,* a copy of which is herewith inclosed. The failure of the cotton Bureau to turn over cotton to Captain M., being in the field without supplies, able to obtain no money, no cotton, and but a very limited amount of supplies from Colonel Benavides, it was necessary for my quartermaster to use the cotton reclaimed by my men under control of Colonel Lovenskiold, or I would have been compelled to abandon the country to the enemy. When I moved from the San Fernando a column of 600 Yankees was marching against Laredo. The disposition of my command has protected the cotton
