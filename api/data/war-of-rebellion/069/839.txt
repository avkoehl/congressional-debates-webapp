HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,May 27, 1864-7 a. m.

General BRECKINRIDGE;

GENERAL: The general commanding decides that it is not necessary to send Colonel Johnson's infantry ahead of the other troops. Let his command move with your own. They could accomplish nothing by themselves.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,May 27, 1864-7.30 p. m.

Major General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE, Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: General Lee bids me say that he wishes you to proceed after General Anderson, who will camp on a stream on this side of Haw's Shop on the road to Atlee's Station. General Anderson has instructions to move for Atlee's at 3 o'clock in the morning, and General Lee desires you to adapt your movements to his. General Lee's headquarters are at Jenkins' houses, near where you turn off to the left from Telegraph road to Haw's Shop. As there is good water in Stony Creek just where Anderson's line of march turns off from the Telegraph road, General Lee thinks it best for you to camp at thee intersection of these roads and make your troops comfortable for the night, and to communicate to him the position of your headquarters and condition of your troops.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. S. VENABLE,

Aide-de-Camp.
