Throughout the whole canduct of this wai, the
West India squadron has co operated with the
army in the most active and efficient mannei, not
only by promptly furnishing every aul which the
appropriate duties of that branch of the service re-
quired, but by the officers taking «pon themselves
the defence of posts on shore, and lending the aid
of their professional skill, in every situation m
which it could be usefully applied, with that per-
severing courage, zeal, and abilitj which have, at
all times, distinguished our gallant navy The re-
venue-cutters, placed under the command of the
commodore 6f that squadron, have likewise ren-
dered the most efficient service, under the dnec-
Hon of that excellent officer Paitoi the marine
CJrps, which volunteered us services in Florida,
and distinguished itself during Ihe 11st campaign,
still remains there, and it is hoped ih-it ihey may
be permitted to continue their valuable services
to the army of the south, until the close of die
war.
The events of this war, and the heavy expenses
attending it, have shown the propriety, and even
necessity, of increasing and organizing the stall,
and of augmenting the army of the Unitul States
tn ihe last annual report from this department
this measure is strongly recommended, and tin
teasonsfor its adoption ably uiged I do nut
think, however, that the manner oí -iiv'ii enitng

¡durable action ol one bi.inch of the Lcislatmc,
i i„ it lo be earned into effect The oigani/ation
ni the army when it was reduced to the peice
est ibluhinent, oui,ht not to be aban !< ned It is
fut d to render the gteatest service in limeol peace
and to afford a basis for the augmentation of the
effective forces ol the country so a much greatti
pttcnt m time of war. This anangement should
Hot, therefore, be disturbed, but the same system
timed out in making new levies I would re-
tommeiidlhe addition of three regiments ot infan-
try, and that the companies both of arlillci} and
Hit mtrj should be lticieised to stxlj-four iinK

greatly impair its discipline Such, however, is
the present defective sialf of every branch of the
staff, that all are supplied lrom subalterns of the
line. The department of the Q,uarttimnstei Gene-
ral, the Commissary General, the Engineers, the
Ordnance, the Pa)mister General, and the Topo-
graphical corps, art all compelled to make drafts
from the line of the army for the performance of
their indispensable duties, and the returns of the
Adjutant General's Office, of the regiments in the
field during the last campaigns in AHbama «ind
Florida, exhibit a lamentable delii tencj of ofliceib to
fuifil the duties properly belonging to them
lot C íaneimasters Department requires not
mi! s„ nc nlargement, but ihe addition of higher
¿    i s, to le i ler it adequate to the duties required
01  it The >mictions of this branch of the stiff,
comprising, as tl.cy do, the quartering, supplying
and moving the arm), with all its ctore , and the
execution ot various objects of national improve-
ment, are important at all times, but they become
peculiarly so ¡a smm of gcuye operations, lifee
the present, w hen laige bodies ofinegulai troops
are necessarily called into service lo aid our limited
reguiar ioiee
The deficiency in the number of officers piovided
for this sen ice has been sensibly felt from the com-
mencement ol our late bordei elwtuibances, and
especially dnnng Ihe past season, and with respect
to highei grides than those now authorized, expe-
rience has clearly shown the necessity of some
clothed with the adequate ranks to enable, them to
take the chugeol lemote districts, and supervise
the expenditure, ami dnectand control the compli-
cated operations ol the department in the field It
isceitam that time cm he no eileotive uihtaiy

that branch of the staff «hub i to m ivc and sup-

rec  Thib brief recapitulation of the various mi-
litary and civil duties oí the torps, clearly points
out the necessity of its complete organization, and
uuUcatjs the propriety of attaching ip to the gene-
i al staff of the army. The direction or all the
works, both civil and military, herein described,
properly belongs to this branch of the service. A
simple enumeration of the functions of the Quar-
termaster General will iliow that the duties Of his
office cannot be performed without the assistance
of the officers of, the topographical corps. They
are to injure an efficient system of supply, and to
give facility and effect to the movements and ope-
rations of tfie aimy, which cannot be accomplished
w ithout a ihorongh knowledge of the topography
of ihe country It i Ins duty, likewise, lo select
sites An encampments, and to assign to ihe diffe
rent coips thc-riound ihey are to occupy—a duty
which rcqunes ihe aid of topographical engineers,
as does the stipeiiiitendence of the woiks at the sc-
vcial posts, the construction of militny road , the
niqmsition of such knowledge as the department is
t,xpccted to possess with regard to the military re-
sources ol the country, the means and facilities of
ti importation, the stale of the lrontiers, wnh the
most eligible points flu concentrating troops and
collecting supplies, whether in relation to offensive
oi d< fuisive operations; This iniormatioti cannot
hi obtained without the active co-operation of the
topogiaplucal corps
I cannot dismiss this subject without adveiting
to the opinion of my predecessor, in relation to the
emplovmenl of the (oposnaphjoal engineers of the
aimy by Slates and incorporated companies, |m
which I fully concur At a penod when it became
a practice of the Government to pel mil these ofh-
ccistoaidin the construction of the public woiks
in the aevoraI States, the description of talent and
knowltdge winch thev po scssul was uncommon
in oqr counii), and winks of great public utility
ivoutd have been suspended oi abandoned alto-
gether, if this permission had been withheld A
diflo'ent state ol things now exists The demand
for civil engmeeis has cit ated tin in, and not only
is it no longt i necessary to aid blahs and tompa-
ntes by kndinr' them ofliou of the aimy, but in
doing so an ad of injustice is committed toward
the (ivil mginuisol the countiy. 'Jheic can be
no doubt that the purine imp urs, vciy sensibly,
the i fhi ii nt v ol the coips as a bunch of the army,
uní dt puns the Government ot tin u services for
mditaiv nrvt)s, and Ihetreclion and Eupenntcnd-
meiol woiks of national utility The commander
ol the .may of the south says emphatically, in a
1 itt communication to the Adjutant General, "Had
the topographic il engmeprs been employed in their

sixticn since we have obtained po«s(suon of the

in 1 p nsillyiiecc iry to rendci the several parts
ol ilit teicnl staff of the army effective, it be-
comes my dnt) to submit to voui consideration the
defects ol Ihe present system, and to suggest a bet-
ter i rsmi/iiion of this most useful and important
branch of the s< rvice On examiog the functions

that in the mo/ingand subsisting the army, pro-
viding fu clothing ?nl supplies, including trans-
