Choctaw anil Chickasaw Indians, in the Indian terri-
tory, as provided by the treaties with said tribes in
1866, for the tiscal year ending June 30,1ST2, $13,509;
Provided, That any other Indian tribe permanently
located in eaiu Indian territory shall be, and is
hereby, authorized to elect and send to said "gen-
eral council" one delegate, and, in addition, one
delegate for each one thousand Indians or frac-
tion of a thousand greater than five hundred, being
members of such tribe, on the same tcrm3 and con-
ditions, and with the same rights and privileges,
including right to compensation, as is provided for
delegates of the tribes hereinbefore mentioned, and
a sufficient sum to pay the per diem and mileage of
. such additional delegates is hereby appropriated.
â–  Mr. HARLAN. This is in pursuance of
treaties made with the Cherokees, Choctaws,
Cbickasaws. and Creeks in 18CG.
Mr. POME ROY. Is this for llieir late
council?
Mr. HARLAN. No; for their annual coun-
cil the coming year. The treaty provides that
they shall be authorized to meet in general
council every year, to make rules and regula-
tions for the government of the whole com-
munity.
Mr. COLE. I should like to inquire of the
Senator if we have ever made such an appro-
priation as this before ?
Mr. HAItLAN. Yes; it was made last year
for the first time, and the first session of that
council was held during the last autumn or the
beginning of winter.
Mr. POMEROY. How much money does
it take ?
Mr. HARLAN. The amount named is
about thirteen thousand five hundred dollars;
that is for the tribes who are named; but there
are other tribes who have settled in the terri-
tory since, who have been invited to meet them,
the Kiowas, the Comanches, the Wichitas, and
other Indians in the Indian territory.
Mr, COLE. I observe that the amount
appropriated for this purpose last year was
310,000. Now, this amendment, as usual,
from the Committee on Indian Affairs, pro-
poses a larger sum. That is no surprise what-
ever. But if we are to follow the law of last
year, and keep up this Indian congress, I think
the sum of $10,000 is all they ought to ask.
Mr. HARLAN. The treaty provides for so
much a day for each delegate, and limits the
number of delegates proportionately to the
number of Indians in each tribe.
Mr. COLE. But I submit that for these
very Indians we appropriate money elsewhere
in pursuance of treaty obligations, and I pre-
sume they have money enough, independent
of this appropriation, to move themselves to
the place of council.
Mr. HARLAN. I have no doubt that some
of these Indian nations could defray the ex-
penses of their own delegates. If they were
white men there would be no question about
this appropriation at all. When we organize
a Territory for white men, we appropriate
money to pay the salary of a Governor, and
judges, and members of the Legislature, and a
public printer, and everything of that kind, and
there is no question ever raised about paying
the expenses of members of the Legislature.
Why should there be if they happen to be red
men?
Mr. COLE. But those are independent
nations and they ought to bo able to maintain
their own Legislature. We treat with them as
independent Powers, and now we are called
upon to bear the expense of their congress as
well as our own.
Mr. STEWART. I wish to offer an amend-
ment to the amendment, which I think will
come in appropriately at this place. I want
to test the Senate to see whether there is a
real, bona fide disposition to enter upon the
work of civilizing these Indians. I offer this
proposition in good faith. It has been sug-
gested to me that I ought to propose a plan.
I take the plan which is proposed by the Com-
mittee on Territories after a careful examina-
tion. I take a portion of their bill, two or
three sections, that portion ot it which is
absolutely necessary for the purpose of the
civilization of the Indians. I call the special
attention of the Senate to the proposition.
After it is read I have some remarks to make
on the subject. I ask the Clerk to read my
amendment.
The Chief Clerk proceeded to read the
amendment to the amendment to the amend-
ment, which was to add the following sec-
tions :
, 5? it further enacted. That there sballbe a local
land office established in the Indian Territory, at
tbfc capital thereof, under existing laws on that sub-
ject, and a surveyor general, register, and receiver
appointed therefor, for the same terms and at the
same salaries as are now fixed by law for like officers
in the district of Nevada; and the individual selec-
tions hereinafter referred to shall be made under the
direction of the register and receiver of said office,
who shall have authority to decide all questions and
differences arising in relation to said selections, and
whose decision thereupon shall bo final, subject only
to appeal to the Commissioner of the General Land
Office and Secretary of the Interior, as under exist-
ing laws. The said register and receiver, during said
selections, may temporarily remove their office to
the different localities in which said selections are

missionary labor for five consecutive years immedi-
ately preceding the passage of this act, in any of the
said tribes, shaii be permitted to select one quarter-
section for a permanent home; and where any re-
ligious society has heretofore erected any permanent
building for religious or educational purposes upon
any of the said lands, a quantity of land, not now

sage of this act, within the limits of the reservation
of any tribe in said Territory shall have the same

tribo as the members thereof. .
be it furth-jr enacted, That said selections shall

tribe to which the same belongs in the general edu-
cation of its members, and in instructing them ia
agricultural and mechanical pursuits, and furnish-
ing to them the necessary implements and material
for carrying on these branches of industry.
Before the reading was concluded,
Mr. ANTHON14 Will the Senator from
Nevada allow me to appeal to him ? It is
manifest to every one that we cannot pass upon
a measure of this kind now. It seems to me
it is only consuming time and throwing over
into the next session the necessary legislation
of this session. It is utterly impossible for us
to consider that proposition. It would require
four days' discussion before a man here could
vote intelligently upon it.
Mr. COLE, I also appeal to the Senator
from Nevada to let us go on and finish this
appropriation bill.
Mr. STEWART. I regard this as a very
important proposition. I shall not occupy any
time on the rest of the bill, but I do want to
have a few minutes on this very important
proposition. It is more important than all
the rest of the bill. It is the only thing in the
bill for the civilization of the Indians. I want
to say a few words with regard to it.. I am in
good faith about it; but if I cannot be heard
on that, then 
Mr. POMEROY. I ask the Senator to yield
to a motion for a recess, so as to have an even-
ing session and complete the bill.
Mr. STEWART. We had better go right on.
Mr. HARLAN. I hope the honorable Sen-
ator from Nevada will yield for that purpose.
I am very tired myself.
Mr. ANTHONY. I hope there will not he
any recess. I think we had better sit this bill
out this evening. I iiope tho Senator from
California will hold the Senate here until this
bill is passed, if we have to stay till sunrise.
Mr. POMEROY. He will find himself with-
out a quorum pretty soon.
Mr. ANTHONY. Then we shall send for
the absent Senators.
Mr. POMEROY. I move that the Senate
take a recess.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Nevada is on the floor.
Mr. POMEROY. He has yielded for that
PUThe VICE PRESIDENT. Does the Sen-
ator from Nevada yield the floor to allow a
motion for a recess.
Mr. STEWART. No; I do not. I want to
go right on with the bill.
