Colonel Pritchard found a detachment of the First Wisconsin Cavalry, under Lieutenant-Colonel Harnden, on Davis' track ahead of him; he then took a circuitous route, and by marching until 2 a. m. on the 10th instant succeeded in gaining Irwinville while Davis was in camp three quarters of a mile north of
