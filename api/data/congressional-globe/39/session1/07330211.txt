lie debt. It is not a question of policy, but it
is a question of necessity. A large portion of
this debt matures very soon, ana it must be
either renewed or paid off. It can only be
i paid off by selling other bonds, and conse-
; quently there is necessity of prescribing the
1 terms of these new securities. I have here a

It will thus be seen that while the pressure
of the principal of the public debt is not very
great now, yet $178,000,000 is within the reach
of the Secretary, and that next year and the
year following both the seven-thirties and five-
twenties come within his reach for payment
or conversion.
Mr. CLARK. I suppose it is not a necessity
that they must be redeemed. It is at the option
of the Secretary.
Mr. SHERMAN. I say it is within the
power of the Secretary.
Mr. CLARK. The Government may have
a longer time if it chooses.
Mr. SHERMAN. Yes, by paying six per
cent, interest in gold. I wish simply now to
show that it is within the power of the Govern-
ment, if it can reduce the rate of interest, to
do so consistently with the stipulations of the
bonds.
But there is another argument derived also
from another table that I have before me.
All modern nations who are now dealing very
largely in public debt have as a matter of policy
reduced their public debt to some simple, tan-
gible form, so that in every country there is
a specific debt known to the people of that
country, with a fixed rate of interest prescribed
by law; and the whole of the public debt is
generally put in that form as soon as possible.
England had formerly the same diversity of
securities that we now have; but it has been
the policy of English statesmen, from William
Pitt down to this time, to reducc that debt
into one simple form, so that nothing but the
interest should be provided for, and the result
has been that the whole of the public debt of
England is reduced to a three per cent, debt
except about one million pounds. The total
amount of the public debt of Great Britain is
£709,802,139, and the whole of this may now
bo said to be a three per cent, annuity, the
principal, however, redeemable at the pleasure
of the Government. In France I find the same
thing has occurred. The term " rentes" gen-
erally describes the great mass of the public
debt. I think all the debt, except a few tech-
nical annuities, given probably for specific pur-
poses, one called " obligations trentenaircs,"
and some floating debt, is now funded in the ]
form of rentes. The debt of Russia, also, is |
now funded into three, four and a half, and j
five per cent, stocks—the great body of it in
the form of five per cent, foreign loans. The
same statement holds good^in regard to all
European countries. Every nation in Europe,
where a public debt has existed in some cases
for centuries, has adopted it as a principle to
reduce that debt to as simple a form as possi-
ble, so that the interest alone would be a charge
upon the treasury, and that a sinking fund
should pay off gradually such portion of the
principal of the public debt as the policy of
the Government would allow.
It is manifest that if the debt of the United
States was now reduced to one simple form of
a five per cent, stock or bond, so that the Uni-
ted States need not look except to the payment
of the interest of that debt, and to the pa-yment
or purchase of such portion of the principal as
its policy might dictate, much of our financial
difficulty would be removed. What is now the
trouble with us? Why cannot this project be
adopted ? The answer is that a very large por-
tion of the principal of the public debt becomes
due in a short time, and the Secretary must
provide for the payment of that principal: and
this very necessity of going constantly into the
market to renew these loans imposes upon him
nearly all the burdens of his office. And yet
I do not arraign the policy that was adopted
during the war of making short loans. It was
proper to do it, it was necessary to do it._ It
was not proper for this Government to stipu-
late to pay these high rates of interest for a
long period of time, and therefore during the
war it was necessary to make short loans at a
high rate of interest; but it was always done
in view of reducing the rate of interest after
the war should be over, and with a view of
consolidating this whole debt. " The policy, so
far as I know, of those connected with the
finances of the country, has been to keep ever
in view the principle of redeemability in every
form of security issued during the war. There-
fore the five-twenty note was payable or might •
he paid after five years. The seven-thirties and
the various forms of securities that have been
issued are within the reach of the Government
in a short time. Why was this idea so care-
fully kept in view? Simply to enable the Uni-
ted States to retain the advantage of paying the
principal after the war when loans could be
negotiated on more favorable terms. And
now we may properly reap the benefit of this
wise policy. We may now enter the money
market with the laurels of victory and peace.
We need no longer compete with the indus-
trial interests of our citizens in borrowing
money, but may prescribe our own terms and
renew oyr debts on conditions consistent with
our vast power and resources.
Now, Mr. President, the only additional ques-
tion I need present in this connection is, is this
the time to fund the public debt? I say em-
phatically it is. I believe we have wasted four
or five precious months in doing it. I believe
that the process would have been easier at the
beginning of this session than it will be now;
and why ? In order to fund the public debt
of the United States a large amount of cur-
rency is necessary; but it is necessary for us
to reduce our currency as soon as possible.
We cannot get back to specie payments with-
out some reduction of the currency. Every one
desires to resume specie payments. Before we
return to specie payments this debt ought to
be funded. It cannot, be funded on as favor-
able terms after we return to specie payments.
The very abundance of the currency obviously
enables us to fund the debt at a low rate of
interest; and it is just and right, as this debt
was contracted upon an inflated currency, that
upon that same currency the debt^ought to be
funded in its permanent form. The effect of
the superabundance of paper money is to
reduce the rate of interest; that is obvious.
At the time of the celebrated John Law ex-
citement, the rate of interest in France was
reduced to one and a half per cent, by the
overwhelming amount of paper money. I say
that now, above all others, is the time to fund
this debt in some form of security. _ If we
postpone it six months or a year it will only
add to our difficulties. The longer we post-
pone it, and the longer we leave this amount
of floating indebtedness upon the market of
the United States, the less will we be able to
fund it at a low rate of interest and on favor-
able terms. And, sir, we have no choice about
it. We have got to do it, bccause this debt is
maturing, and we have got to put it in some
other form unless we intend—to use^ a very
expressive phrase—to shin it, and go into the
market to renew short loans. This debt ma-
tures. and it has got to be paid. It can be
paid, not by taxes but by selling new bonds
and new loans; and therefore we must deter-
mine upon some form of funding this debt as
soon as practicable. And this brings me to
the main question involved in this bill, and
that is what rate of interest the Lnited States
ought to pay on our public debt. Upon
$830,000,000 we are now paying interest at
the rate of seven and three tenths per cent.,
higher than we allow our citizens to exact 1'fom
each other. Upon the great part of our debt
we pay six per cent, in gold, equivalent at
present rates to seven and eight tenths per
cent, in the currency for whieli_ the bonds
were sold. Wo exempt our public creditors
from the burdens of taxation. The question
