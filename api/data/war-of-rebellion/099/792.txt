HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, S. C., March 11, 1865.

Major-General SHERMAN:

There are about 7,000 men here belonging to your army that I wish to forward to North Carolina as soon as possible, but I am not able to commence yet for the reasons that my transports are all engaged moving a part of my own command to Wilmington, by order of Lieutenant-General Grant, and I am greatly in want of coal for the streamers thus engaged. I have thus far been able to keep going by borrowing from the navy, but don't expect to get much more from that source. The first steamer that goes from this place to New York or Fort Monroe will carry an application for some transports for this purpose. I have requested General Schofield to send both steamers and coal if he can do so. I expect to send from my own command over 4,000 of my best white troops.
