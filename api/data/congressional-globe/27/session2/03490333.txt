ment, nnul they can be made to run more smooth-
ly, they may stop.    I am willing to take th   re-
sponsibility of stopping all until we can begin and
go on m the right way.   I did not sympathise
■with the Government in tGe appeal for ¡Le last
loan—I do   not sytnpath se with  it now.   Un-
less something shall be done to make the revenues
and expefiditnres more nearly me<-t, thes   appeals
fer loans will come upon us fasci  and tbicoi;
and we may as well resist them first as last    Hed
we refu ed to borrow at first, but conmeneed the
work of retrenching expenditure^, or of nismg re
venue, or both, we would not now need the present
loan, nor wouid the credit oí the Government be
discredited     To   my   mind,  the   course   to   be
pursued   1*,   for  the   Committee on Public Ex-
penditures and th<° Committee on  Retrenchment
immediately to bring in bil s to dispense with all
needless officers and agents, reduce all exorbitant
salaries, and to stop expenditure^ for a 1 and every
thing that can  be postponed, until the Treasury is
in a more prosperous cond tion, and ¡et us go to
work honestly   ard sincerely en these subjects.
When the<e bil's are brought in, ard it will be in
order to show  what ougH to be done to retienen,
and we can bring the matter lo a voip, í pledge
myself to show wher-  large sums of money can be
saved, and I will go with Whigs or Democrats in
saving them.    Let us do this, and we n^ed nat
talk about raising our credit by lung ter >,s o*
loans, or short terms of 1 ans, high 'nterct or lot'
interest, for then  e will want nu loan>, ve will
want no credit     The Demrcra ic party have b en
charged with oppps.tion to the credit system     For
one, I am oppo ed to this kind of a credit system—
it is wrong m principle, and expen ivi| a^d de-
grading   in   practice      we    have    been   call d
the  "perish  credit"  party, bat the ccurtry can

nistration of Geteral Jackson  the  whole deb of
teh Government was paid off  Under Mr Van Bo-

istence, a loan could  have been obtained at 5 per
cent and mostly a a premium     Tieasury notes,
then issued at 5 per cent interest c mwanded the
specie everywhere, and at some plpres were worth
more than srer e, such was the s ¿te of th" credit
of the G ivemment under De   o^ra'tc Ad' i-i t a-

But what is it now under Whig Adran istration
—the great supportersoftflie "creditsystem" tarry?
