[CHAP. XXII.

NASHVILLE, TENN., March 17, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

I have information, which seems reliable, that Beauregard moved last Thursday from Corinth and Jackson to some other point not named-probably Savannah-to operate against Smith, in anticipation of his crossing. A part of the force was to strike the river below Savannah, to cut off transportation. The force moving toward Savannah is said to number 26,000.

D. C. BUELL,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Saint Louis, March 17, 1862.

General D. C. BUELL,

Nashville, Tenn.:

I fully understand these movements. Move on, as ordered to-day, to re-enforce Smith. Savannah is now the strategic point. Don't fail to carry out my instructions. I know that I am right.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Saint Louis, March 18, 1862.

General BUELL, Nashville:

No wounded prisoners of war have been sent by me to Louisville. Who sent any there and where were they sent from? Please answer my telegram of yesterday.

Enemy has evacuated Island Numbers 10, but has heavy batteries on mainland and seems disposed to stand a siege.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Saint Louis, March 18, 1862.

General BUELL, Nashville:

If one or both of the gunboats in the Cumberland can be spared they should be sent to the Tennessee. I have ordered four into the Tennessee to convoy transports, but have just learned that only two were sent, Commodore Foote having taken all the others down the Mississippi.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, March 18, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

I understand that General Smith is on this side of the river. If it is so, he had better commence the telegraph line to meet us.

D. C. BUELL.
