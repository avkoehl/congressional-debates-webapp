received to advance on the enemy's works; at 3 o'clock an order saying the movement was general. I immediately put my command in position to advance and at 3.20 moved forward, my Second Brigade (Colonel Hofmann) leading, supported by my First Brigade (Colonel Bragg). General Ayres, of the Second Division, did not receive the order in time to enable him to move simultaneously with me. My command suffered severely both by direct and flank fire of both infantry and artillery,and though a part of both brigades got within about seventy-five yards of the enemy's works they were unable to carry them. My men held the ground gained until dark, when, in obedience of orders, I withdrew the most advanced portions of my command and intrenched, connecting with Griffin on my right and Ayres on my left. In this affair I lost in killed and wounded about one-third of the men I had with me, and among them many valuable officers. After intrenching I remained in the same position to the close of the month, on the last day of which* a mine was sprung in front of the Ninth Corps and a little to my right. In obedience to orders received the evening before, I had my First Brigade in the trenches and my Second Brigade in reserve ready for any duty required of them. At 9.30 a.m. I strengthened my skirmish line and pushed it forward in close proximity to the enemy's works. Beyond this I took no part in the operations. This closes the period for which reports are at present required.

Since the commencement of the campaign the Third Brigade (Stone's) has been transferred to the First Division. The term of service of the Fourteenth Brooklyn, in the Second Brigade, and the Second Wisconsin, in the First Brigade, have expired. Three small regiments (the Third and Fourth Delaware and One hundred and fifty-seventh Pennsylvania) have been added to the Second Brigade. The regiments which still remain* of the old division had, when the campaign commenced, 3,742 enlisted men in the ranks. They now have (excluding those who have been wounded and returned) 1,324; including those, 1,404. The regiments whose terms have expired suffered equally with the others while they remained.

The changes in the command have been so frequent, and the losing of nearly every original brigade, regimental, and company commander, render it impossible to make anything like an accurate report as to details. One thing I think may safely be claimed for the division-that it has endeavored to discharge its duties as promptly and cheerfully as any command in the army. If in common with the army it has not achieved any brilliant victories its list of casualties shows that it lacked not in its endeavors nor shrunk from its duties.

I cannot close this report without saying how deeply I felt the loss of the many brave officers and men who have fallen in this campaign.

To my personal staff I am under great obligations. They have all, without exception, discharged the constant, fatiguing, and dangerous duties imposed on them in the bravest manner and with the almost alacrity. One only of their number has been killed, Lieutenant Chilson, of the Twenty-fourth Michigan, who fell by my side in the charge of the enemy's works on the 18th of June.

The list of casualties which is herewith inclosed is necessarily incomplete on account of the frequent changes and great loss of officers in the command.
