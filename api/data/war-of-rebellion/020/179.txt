Four bridges were destroyed by throwing off the plank and cutting the spans, only two of which were of sufficient width to detain cavalry and artillery. The largest was about 12 or 15 feet in width, with banks of about 4 feet in height. No further engineering duties were performed except to assist in repelling an attack made by the enemy as we were re-embarking.

We were all safely back at the Planter about 5.30 p.m., and as the tide soon floated her, got under way for Mackay's Point, where I reported on board the steamer George Washington; but finding that steamer remained on board until morning, when I reported to yourself and Colonel Serrell on shore, receiving orders from him to report back with my detachment on board the George Washington if she should arrive before the Planter left; if not, to remain with the latter and be towed back to this post. In compliance with this order I arrived here at or about 3 p.m. of the 23rd instant.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. C. EATON,

Captain, Commanding Detachment of Volunteer Engineers.
