agent of the rebels on this side. Disclosed the whole plot, showing that the men were to come in on different trains at Sandusky last evening, and with boats capture the Michigan and attack this post. I placed men at Sandusky and searched each train on arrival. Cole implicated Stanley, Brown, Williams, Merrisk, Strain, and Rosenthal, citizens of Sandusky, to some extent, I can't say how far. On the direction of the commander of the Michigan I handed their names to Captain Steiner, provost-marshal. He arrested them and I now have them in charge. The Michigan left on a cruise outside at daylight this morning; will probably be back soon unless she gets fairly in chase. If the scoundrels come this way, even in the absence of the Michigan, I will give a good account of them, but I wish I had all my detachments back.

Colonel, Commanding.

The above number of officers and men were of the last 2,000 captured and came properly under the terms agreed upon.

Federals given in return, including non-commissioned officers and privates, 825.

Among the number sent up by General Winder were 132 non-commissioned officers and privates, all of whom were captured by General Forrest on the Mississippi River, and consequently did not come under the terms agreed upon. The Federal officer of exchange refused to receive them and I have returned them to Andersonville.

I have yet to furnish them 1,172 men. They are to furnish me 498 to complete the 2,000 between us. The prisoners received yesterday are all, under the charge of General Govan, going to their commands.
