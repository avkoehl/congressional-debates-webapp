Mr CHARLEb BROWN (Mr Gushing yielding the floor)
read certain extracts from the report of the investigating com
mittee of 1859, (of which Mr Wise wae. chairman,) to show
how lar he (Mi B) was coirect in the explanation he had made
in a former part of the debate
Mr B sa d itwas evident, from the extracts hehad read tint
what he ha 1 said in relation to the charges made against the First
Auditor, wastrue to the lettei, and that it wis the gentleman
from Virginia [Mr Wise] who was in eiror, anl did not know
what was in the report alluded to There had bpen nothing
proved, or attempted to be proved, against Mr Miiloi, but that
he had suffered the bond books to remain behin 1 hand Mr
Miller tame into (fliuem I83t>, an i these b nk& ha I not been

After the defalcation of "swart wout was discovered, Mr Millei
saw the erroi in suffering these bond book-* to remain unattend

came too late Mr B repeated that the report of thelnvestiga
tmg Committee proved that all he had said m the remarks he
had made was literacy true, and that Mr Miller stood charged
with not nine more than what he had asserted
Mr Wiskajam corrected Mr Brown in relation to this last
explanation, reading (af er some interiuptions on points of or
der) at some length from the report foi this purpose
