THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 4,
now is, were there in truth any such persons who
were then legal residents in the county of Ander-
son, or were the judges imposed upon'—or, in
other words, was there a fiaud committed > If so,
and tlat can be made to appear, it vitiates the
whole proceeding—it destroys the whole effect of
the record, and he could not doubt that all this
was very competent and proper toshojr And
the question now is, whether the evidence which
had been offered was sufficient to rebut the evi-
dence resulting from the fact that these names
appear upon the record The latter is presumptive
evidence, but it may, nevertheless, be impeached
by testimony of a like charaUei Well, then,
he would ask, what evidence has been adduced
by Mr Moore, tending to impeach the evidence
resulting from the record > For he could not, for
a moment, believe that if Major Mooie had
brought foi ward the affidavit of every inhabitant
in the county, and it should appeal that no knowl
edge was had of any such persons as Williams
and Dawson, that the record would be set aside at
once as wholly unworthy of confidence
The House, then,is bound to weigh all theevi
detice, and to see whether the weight of testimony
is  not now decidedly  against  the record     Mr
Moore had taken the deposition of the sheriff and
of certain  constables—men  whose business  led
them  through  the county—men who would be
likely to know the legal inhabitants of lh ir county,
and they had testified unqualifiedly that persons
of those names weie not known to them—thai,
they d'd  not believe   that   any   such    peisons
resided within the limits of the coanty     But it has
been asked, why has not the testimony of the
judges of the election been taken —that ihey 1 ad
the means of knowing better than the deponents
To thi3 remark he could not yield his assent   He,
for one, did  not believe ■that these judges could
know the resident citizens of then com ty as well
and as generally as shenfls or as constables   The y
were men who, from the natuie of their office,
from then usual avocations, did not mix with the
membeis of the community to the extent that sher
iffs and oncers of that chaiaoter necessarily must
Judges weie found in then -studies, and confined
lo the dischaige of t>uch ofiiuul duties as must
necessai ily limit their personal a< quimtance with,
and   knowledge   of,  their  fellow citizens,   while
«hendí and constable', fiom the very natuie of J
their employments, extended then   acquaintance
Into every village and neighborhood   Hedifleied, '
theiefoie, from the gentleman from Noith Cam  i
Una, that M )oi Moite should have obtained the
testimony of the judges of the election rathe than
the testimony of the she) if and of the c instables
He was of the opinion that the evidence piouued
wis entitled   to inoie ronsideiatir n than the e\    '
deuce of the judges alone would ha\e been      But
the testimony rf the witnesses is not all the evi
denee which has I cen offered going to show that
there weie no suih jiersri s res ! ng in the oountj
in Augwt last as Wi'liams and  Diwson     The
books of the commissioneis have been examined,
and c f those whose duty it is in  each spnnj; to
make a peifect list of all the inhabitants m the
county wilh leference to such peisonal taxation,
and upon such books and  upon such  lists ti e
n lmra of Williams an I Dawson cannot be found
Ucie, then, is not only the positive dcclmati n i f
living wane ses who have ihe means of knowledge,
but here ai e the books of the county commissioner,
the lists of the tax payéis   all going t) show that
no such peisons as Williams anJ Diwson were
íesidmg in thecounty on the dry of election    And
he would ask, is not ill this sufliuot to do awiy
the force of the evidence resulting f om the meie ,
fact that th  na nes of two such persons wei e found
on th° poll book?    He contended it was, and that |
the committee did entirely light in lfjecting these
\otes     The piesumption arising fiorn all t! isteo
timony is, that no such peisons weie there, that a
wrong has been done, t nd the burden of proof is
changed    It is now the duty, and ceitamly is in the
powerofMr Letcher,accoidiogto the suggestions
of thegentlen an from Kentucky, [Mi  Chilton,]
to put this matter beyond all doubt    That gentle   I
man has said that the lists of the cons ables of the
county being tenor tv/elvem number,thatthemth-
Ma rolls would  j ut th s matter to rest—*hat they
would be conclusive on this subject, and he has j
been pleased to add, that Major Moore should have I
looked to those quarters for satisfactory evidence
on this point He differed in this partió llar from
that gentleman M Moore had done all that was
incumbent on him to do, and it devolved on the
other side to give us further light, and it was not
an arduous or a difficult duty to perform, for it
would seen, fiom the remarks of the gentleman
from Kentucky, that if these men weie honest
voters, weie actual residents at the time, it can be
shown, it can be made to appear He would then
ask, why has not Mr Letcher gone to the consta-
bles, and to the militia officers, and put this matter
at rest' Why has he not done it'—it was clearly
in his power, if the authority of the gentleman
from Kentucky can be relied upon The answer
is at band—the evidence which would come from
those quarters would go only to confirm the testi
mony already taken It is fair to presume this,
and if the judges of the election would be able to
give any different coloi to this transaction, their
testimony would have been produced—it was
within the reach of Mr Letchei And after all
that Mr Moore had shown in evidence, it was
not to be reqj'reu that he should go further—the
buideii wis changed Ihe duty hud devolved on
Mr Letcher Inasmuch, then,as no attempt has
been mide by Mr Letchei to satisfy the mind on
this po tit, to make this matter clear, is it not fair
to presume that no evidence does exist, or can be
obtained, which will go to change the evidence
offeied by Mi Moore, and now in the case?
When the inquiry was made by the honorable
gentleman from Georgia, [Mi Gamble,] whethei
time hat. been rllowed to Mr Letcher, he thought
the answei was not so full as it should have been
He piesumed there was no disposition to mislead
but he would saj, in fuither answer to the inquiry
of the gentleman from Georgia, lhat thetestmony
by Mi Mooie was taken about the 21) h of No
vemhei last—six weeks befoie the firstof January,
beyond which point of time he believed no testi
mony was allowed to be taken, and that the tes
timony was taken in the presence of Mi Letcher's
agent, who cioss examined the witnesses, and
Mi Letcher must have known that the residence
of those two persons would be questioned, and
their light to vote denied It was no secret no
individual member of the community who took up
a newspaper aftei the election in Kentucky in
August last, and aftei it was mdeistood that the
election in this congressional d stuet would not
le again submitted to the people, could haie
doubted for a moment that the election would be
contested, and strongly and peisevenngly con
tested Mr Letchei, then, was not taken by sur
puse All was open, and all was fin Heiewis
evidence takci fif ¡iropeily legarded) which could
not fail to destroy the foice of the iecord—unex
plained, it w is conclusive And this evidence was
taken in the picsenceof Mi Letcher's agent—at
a time fully «iilhcient to enable him to explain it,
and do it away by othei evidence, if such evidence
lould be found And as there has been no a*
tempt whatever to impeach the testimony of Mr
Mooie's witnesses, it did follow, to h s mind, that
the íepoit of the committee, on this point, ought
to be coi fumed by the House
The debate was furthei continued bv Messrs
WAiNt.J  a  ADAMo, and BRIGUá
Mi LANb took the floor, and intimated nn in
tention o add i ess the House on the s ilject, but,
as the hour was late, he moved an adjournment
which was a^ieed to, and
Ti e House adjourned

upon the adoption of this resolution should be
taken, that it should be by yeas and nays, which
f weie ordeied
Mi I ORSYTH, who was entitled to the floor,
rose and said that he had intended to have ad-
t dressed the Senate upon this subject, but that he
had thrown out yesterday many of the points he
had in contemplation to make, and as his colleague
[Mr King] had expressed a wish to make some
lemarksupon tne subject, he would yield the floor
to him

tion which was agitating the public mind, had
undergone no change fie, nevertheless, intended
to vote for this íesolution, not because he had
much faith in the relief it would produce, but be-
cause avast majority of his constituents, who had
11 spoken on the subject, complained bitteily of ex-
treme pecuniary distress, and prayed for theadop-
I  tion of this very measure as asure means of relief
I   He consideied ua question of mere expediency,
