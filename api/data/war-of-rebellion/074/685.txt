from the artillery connected with the cavalry was, as was the case in the last report, incomplete, because of the operations in the enemy's rear.

Non report is made of Williams' and Waddell's battalions, which were some days since ordered to report to Brigadier-General Wright, as above stated, other than to make known their armament. Those battalions were inspected by me some three weeks since and found in very fair condition, but no inspection could be made at a date sufficiently near for this report.

During the engagement at Jonesborough on the 1st instant, six Napoleons and two 10-pounder Parrott guns were captured by the enemy on Cleburne's line, though the horses were saved, as they were some distance in rear for protection from the enemy's fire. One company has been resupplied with guns, and the other has been mounted as scouts, by request of its officers, under the direction of the provost-marshal-general of the army.
