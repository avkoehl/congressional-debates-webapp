Brigadier-General STURGIS, Lexington, Ky.:

Send word to Colonel [S. R.] Mott and Colonel Pierce to notify their railroad guards, &amp;c., to be constantly on the alert, and watch against any surprise. The movement of General White from Louisa, which I spoke to you of, will render it impossible to send cavalry from there to intercept the enemy. Colonel De Courcy must manage them himself.

Washington, June 15, 1863 - 1 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Murfreesborough, Tenn.:

An intercepted letter from an officer in the office of Adjutant-General Cooper, dated Richmond, April 8, states that Bragg's army, including all arms, is 50,000. A letter from the acting inspector-general of Bragg's staff, dated April 11, says that General Johnston reviewed 60,000 men on that day at Tullahoma. Another officer writing, April 15, from Tullahoma, estimates Hardee's corps at 19,000, and Polk's at about the same, the two making an aggregate of about 35,000 or 40,000; Morgan's cavalry at 6,000 or 8,000; Wharton's at 2,000; Forrest's and Van Dorn's at about 10,000. An officer in Mobile writes, April 15, that seven regiments had been ordered from that place and Polland to go, he supposed, to Tullahoma.

General-in-Chief.
