Colonel SHARPE,

City Point:

I have received seventy-nine deserters from the enemy to-day. An informant, who was posted last night on one of the bridges across the Appomattox, states that an officer of artillery told him that fifty-nine pieces were to cross, to the north side of the Appomattox that night, and that others had gone across the night before; that this artillery came from the south of Petersburg. He also that the citizens of Petersburg had received an order from General Lee that they must remove all their cotton and tobacco within a week. If it was not all remaining would be burned. All quiet along their lines. The troops am their old quarters and camps.
