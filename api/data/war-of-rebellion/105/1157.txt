HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF OREGON,Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter., June 23, 1862.

Lieutenant Colonel R. M. MAURY,

First Oregon Cavalry, Camp Clackamas, Oreg.:

SIR: Direct Major Rinearson, who goes to The Dallas in compliance with Special Orders, Numbers 20, to select a suitable place for a temporary camp of a few days, with a view to the accommodation of the four companies of your battalion. The quartermaster's department will be directed both here and at Fort Dalles to expedite your movement toward Fort Walla Walla, and I have to request that the utmost dispatch and promptness be employed in your march to that post. Owing to the inability of the transportation company between Cascades and The Dalles to supply subistence, it will be well to direct your men to carry one day's cooked rations. Let them also take one day's forage for the horses. For the march from The Dalles to Fort Walla Walla subsistence will be furnished by the commanding officer at Fort Dalles. You will take with you from The Dalles for the march not less than ten days' rations. Two wagons to each company will be furnished for the transportation of your supplies and baggage. A strict adherence is required to the regulation allowance for transportation of troopsin the field, and if in the employemnt of the means furnished a surplus is found, let it be used to convey in increased number of rations. You will be furnished with other instructions from these headquarters for the march from The Dalles before your command leaves that point.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JUSTUS STEINBERGER,

Colonel First Washington Territory Infantry, Commanding District.

COMMANDING OFFICER DISTRICT OF OREGON,

Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter.:

SIR: The mode proposed in your letter of the 19th instant for supplying Fort Colville is approved by the department commander. The general directs that the Oregon cavalry must be on the emigrant route in time to protect the approaching emigration. The obstructions caused by the recent freshets will no doubt be removed in time to permit an early march. The troops under orders to relieve the present garrisonof Fort Colville will, the general directs, be paid previous to leaving Fort Vancuver, if it is possible to do so.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
