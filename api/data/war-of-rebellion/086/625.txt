(Received 7 p. m.)

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN:

The One hundred and fourteenth Ohio Volunteers has been ordered to the mouth of White River by General Reynolds. This leaves me with only one white regiment at this place. I have received a communication from Brigadier-General Brayman requesting me to send a steamer to Natchez for my two regiments there. Shall I do so? All the cavalry are ordered to Baton Rouge. I think that there should be at least one regiment of cavalry here during the winter, and if he emergency will permit I would respectfully recommend that the Second New York [Veteran] be ordered to remain. Answer.

M. K. LAWLER,

Brigadier-General.

The order already given in relation to the cavalry must remain in force. It will probably not be required for many days.
