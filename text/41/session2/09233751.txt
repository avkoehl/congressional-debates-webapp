THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

I had not looked at the reports of the engineer
or the facts of the case since the subject was
before the Senate at the last session, and I
had forgotten until the honorable Senator re-
minded me of it this morning, and until the
fact was further stated by the honorable Sen-
ator from Indiana, that this sum would be re-
quired to blow out the canal and to make it of I
the extent and to build the locks according to
the enlarged plan for the improvement of that [
work. The work, though, that would be neces- i
sarv and the expenses of the work for walling
the* sides of this canal had escaped my atten-
tion and recollection wholly, and I admit that
according to the report of the engineer that
cost would about double the amount of this
appropriation.
But, Mr. President, I spoke in terms that
might seem extravagant to some gentlemen
of the extent of the commercial business that
was done upon the Ohio river and upon the
streams connected with it in navigation, a large
portion of which commerce from every port
on that river and on the Mississippi, ana all
the streams connected with these two great
rivers, goes through these falls. I will read
from the same report which was used by the
honorable Senator from Michigan, to give an
.idea of the extent of the trade and business
that is done upon that river and the streams
whose navigation forms a part of its system:
" This river, with its branches, drains the whole of
parts of ten States of the Union; among them the
wealthiest and most populous. It is one of the most
important in a system giving 18,000 miles of naviga-
ble rivers. "
"The States lying on the banks of the Ohio and
Mississippi rivers, fourteen in number, had, by the
census of 1860, a population of 16,909,494"—
I suppose it is upward of 25,000,000 to-day—
"or more than half the whole population of the
United States; and these two rivers nave a coastline
of 36,098 miles, while the coast of the Atlantic is'2,163
miles, and the Gulf of Mexico 1,764 miles, and of the
Pacific 1,343 miles, on a line of 21,354 miles, including
bays and indentations.
" These rivers drain an area of1,785,267square miles,
more than half of the whole 3.001,002 square miles in
the United States: and these fourteen States, in 1860,
contained 94,402,869 of the 163,110,720 improved acres,
and 126,703.393 of the 244,101,818 unimproved acres of
the whole United States;"—
That was before the acquisition of Alaska—
"and the valuation of property in these fourteen
States shows $8,467,511,274 of the whole valuation of
the United States—$16,277.358,715; showing very con-
clusively that these fourteeu States pay more than
half the taxes, work more than half of the improved
land, have the majority of the population, and also
the majority of the land to develop, of the whole
United States. „ , , , , ^ r j.\.
"By the census of 1860 the whole product of the
United States was valued at $1,900,000,000, while the
foreign exports of the domestic produce were only
$373,189,274, or less than one fifth of the whole pro-
duct, leaving four fifths for exchange in domestic
commerce between the States.
"The proportion of the whole product afforded by
these fourteen States we speak for may be judged by
the returns of their produce gathered from the census
of 1860, and compared with the whole United States,
. as follows:

"The total tonnage owned in the United Statesus
returned in the census of 1860 at 5,353,8(38
t tie portion belonging to thefourteen States as 996,£>o
tons; but it is estimated by competent parties that
the steamers on the Ohio and Mississippi have oarrieu
7,905,216 tons during the year 1866, evincing the ac-
tivity in domestic commerce of thesei river states,
and this commerce, but yet in its infancy, for it is
developing daily, and demonstrating 'hat fromtheso
Suites lias, and must come the food supply tor the
whole nation, aud for export, and tha,t they must also
supply the gold and silver States, which are develop-
ing so largely and quickly upon the tributaries ot
their rivers.
" Besides, on an improved Ohio river more freight
would be carried at a cheaper rate between Pittsburg
and Cairo than by a half dozen railroads connecting
these points."
But, Mr. President, I will not prosecute
these statistical facts further. I merely pre-
sent them to the consideration of the Senate
to demonstrate the importance of the early
completion of the falls of the Ohio river, so as
to secure its perpetual navigation so far as the
river may be perpetually navigated above and
below. For the improvement that the honor-
able Senator from Michigan feels interested
in, the Sault Ste. Marie canal, I have always
been an advocate, and still am. I am entirely
willing that the honorable Senator from Ohio j
shall withdraw this proposition, and I would
not have presented it myself to this bill, I am
free to say.
' Mr. SHERMAN. I withdraw the amend-
ment.
Mr. STEWART. I want to make a report
from a committee of conference in regard to
the fifteenth amendment bill.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I will not yield
to that, because I know it will lead to debate.
Mr. STEWART. I think we might as well
dispose of it.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. No, I want to
dispose of this bill. I am advised that that
report will lead to debate. I do not yield to
it. I have yielded so much to this bill that I
have got sore about it. The Senator's bill
has already taken a week, and it can survive
now until we get through with this appropri-
ation bill.
Mr. ROSS. I offer an amendment that I
gave notice of a few days ago.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. If the Senator
will indulge me a moment, I wish to make some
corrections in the bill which are rendered
necessary by amendments already made.
Mr. ROSS. Very well.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. On page 3 the
footing should be changed. This is rendered
necessary by amendments made. Instead of
$111,880 80 the amount should be $118,512 80.
That amendment is made necessary by -the
amendments of the text.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amend-
ment will be considered as agreed to if there
be no objection. The Chair hears no objection.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. On page 5 there
should be a similar amendment made under
the head of " Capitol police." It is made neces-
sary by the amendments of the text. The
gross sura as it now reads, " making in all
$42,900," should be " $61,208." I move that
amendment.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. On page 7, line
one hundred and forty-eight of the new print
of the bill, I move to strike out '"two' and
insert "fiveso as to read five mail-carriers,
$1,080 each."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. On page 8, line
one hundred and sixty-seven of the old print,
and line one hundred and seventy-four of the
new, I propose to amend by striking out
"$8,000" and inserting "$12,600;" so as to
read, " for laborers, $12,600." I have a note
from the chairman of the committee of the
House, calling my attention to it, and desiring
that this amendment should be made.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. On page 7 the
rection will be made if there be no objection.
The Chair hears no objection.
Mr. ROSS. I now offer the following amend-
ment, to come in at the end of line ten hun-
dred and twenty-two, on page 42:
And for the compensation of extra clerks in re-
placing the township plats and descriptive sheets.
&c., of the land office at Topeka, Kansas, destroyed
by the burning of that office, 85,000, or so macu
thereof as may be necessary.
I have here a communication from the See-
; retaryofthe Interior,recommending this appro-
priation.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I should like to
have that read.
Mr. ROSS. I send it to the desk to be read.
The Chief Clerk read as follows:
footing, instead of being $144,667 60, should
be $147,900. That is the amount appropriated
for compensation of officers of the House ot
Representatives.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. On page 15
there is a clerical error in the new print. The
bill as printed reads, " for publishing the laws
in pamphlet form, $10,000." It should stand

Sir: I have the honor to transmit herewith a copy
of a letter from the Commissioner of the General
Land Office, dated the 16th instant, representing the
necessity of providing for the replacement of certain
township plats and descriptive sheets, destroyed by
fire in the land office at Topeka, Kansas, in Novem-
ber last, and submitting an estimate of an appropri-
ation of $5,000 for the special service required.
Concurring in the views of the ^Commissioner, I
respectfully invite the early attention of the House
of Representatives to the subject.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
j. D. COX, Secretary.
Hon. James G. Blaine,
Speaker of the House of Representatives,
Department op the Interiob,
General Land Office,
Washington, D. C., December 16,1869.
Sir: Referring to my letter of the 30th ultimo,
communicating intelligence of the burning of the
land office at Topeka, Kansas. I have the honor to
state that the preparation of township plats and
descriptive sheets, to take the placo of those de-
stroyed, is a matter pertaining to the office of the
surveyor general of Kansas, but the appropriation
for clerk-hire in that office is barely sufficient to en-
able the surveyor general to employ a force capablo
of attending to urgent current business, while it is
estimated that the preparation of the said plats and
descriptive sheets, about four hundred of oach, will
require the services of a skillful draughtsman for a
year and two competent clerks for a year and a half.
I therefore respectfully suggest that, in view of the
great importance to the settlers in the Topeka dis-
trict of completing, at an early day, the restoration
of the records of the destroyed office, an estimate ot
$5,000 be submitted, to Congress, to provideTor tho
special service required, said sum to be placed to tho
credit of the appropriation " for compensation of tho
clerksin the office ofthesurveyor general of Kansas.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your
obedient servant. J0SBPn s. WI^pN.
Commissioner.
Hon. J. D. Cox, Secretary of the Interior.
Mr. POMEROY. I think the amendment
ought to be put on to some one of these bills.
This perhaps is as good a bill as any for it.
It is a very just thing. One of the land offices
was burned up, and we have got to duplicate
all the plats, and all the proceedings. I sup-
pose this estimate is correct, and it ought to
pass.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. DRAKE. On page 15, line three hun-
dred and "fourteen, after the word " dollars," I
move to insert a provision which I send to the
Chair.
The amendment was read, as follows-:
Provided, That no pardon or amnesty granted by
thoPresident, whethergeneral or special, by procla-
mation or otherwise, nor any acceptance ot such
pardon or amnesty, nor oath taken, nor other act
performed in pursuance or as condition thereof, shall
be admissible in evidence on the part of any claim-
ant in the Court of Claims as evidence in support of
any claim against the United States, or to establish
the standing of any claijnant in said court or his
right to bring or maintain suit therein; lior shall
any such pardon, amnesty, acceptance, oath, or other
act as aforesaid, heretofore offered or putin evidence
in behalf of any claimant in said court, be used or
considered by said court or by the appellate court on
appeal from said court, in deciding upon the claim
I of said claimant or any appeal therefrom, asany part
of the proof to sustain the claim of the claimant or
to entitle him to maintain his action in said Court
of Claims or on appeal therefrom; but the proot ot
loyalty required by the twelfth section of the act ot
March 3,1863, entitled "An act to amend an act to
, establish a court for the investigation of claims
against the United States, approved lebruury .4

"An act to provide for the collection of abandoned
1 property, aud for the prevention of traudi in the
