and nearly east from here to Leary's, and I believe is not to be used by any one. It strikes the road from Old Church to Cold Harbor a little south of the Matadequin Creek. I propose to take that route if there is no objection. It will not interfere with General Ferrero at all, or with General Burnside. Does my order to be prepared to move wherever, required contemplate my moving from Leary's before daybreak?

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have just heard from a reconnoitering party I sent out on the Shady Grove road. They first found cavalry vedettes and then some infantry about the position of the advance line we had in that direction.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

The road you mentioned crosses the head of Allen's mill-point, and you would cross Burnside's troops extending from there toward the Old Church road. The order to be prepared to move wherever required does not contemplate your moving from Leary's before day-light.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 5, 1864-7.05 p. m. (Received 7.08 p.m.)

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

The route you mentioned will not cut Burnside, since it is just concluded that he will only throw back his right to Bosher's. You can therefore use it.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
