1854.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
I now send to the Clerk the communication of
the Postmaster General, giving his views upon the
subject, and will ask that it maybe read:
Post Office Department, February 27,1854.
Sir: I have attentively considered the project of a "bill
to regulate and increase the pay of deputy postmasters,"
submitted by you a short time since, and upon returning it
toyoirl beg leave to present for your consideration the
Views I entertain upon the subject.
For convenient reference I will here state the rates of
commission allowed upon letter postage by existing laws,
as compared with the rates provided by the proposed bill:
Present Rates. Proposed Rates,
50 per cent, on the first. $100 60 percent, on the first. $100
40 per cent, on the next 300 50 per cent, on the next 300
40 per cent, on the next 2,000
15 per cent, on jftl over 2,400
per cent, on letters
tor distribution.
35 per cent, on the next 2,000
15 per cent, on all over 2,400
30 per cpnt. on letters
for distribution.
With the view of ascertaining the effect which the adop-
tion of the proposed rates would have upon the revenue, as
well as to obtain an estimate of thp amount that would he
necessary to defray the expenses of destributine offices
where the commissions at present rates are insufficient, 1
addressed a communication to the Auditor for tins Depart
ment, and herewith submit a copy of his repiv, and of the
tabular statement which accompanied it. This table shows
the aggregate amount of increase in each State and Terri-
tory cast upon the letter postages received in the quarter
ending September 30,1853; but as it is proposed to make
the change of rates commence on the 1st of April, ! 853, he
has estimated thequarter preceding and the two quarters
succeeding the September quarter of that year. This csti
mate shows that the proposed rates of commission would
reduce the revenue ; or, what is the same thing, increase
the expenditures of the Department for " compensation to
postmaster?," "clerks for offices," &c., about $302,944,
Such would probably be the effect of the proposed change
of rates ; and it is respectfully submitted, whether ihe pub-
lic interest really require* theexpenditureof so lar^e a mi in
upon the post offices, at a time when large additions to the
mail facilities are demanded m all part* of the country, and
more especially in the newly settled States and Territories.
There are now more than twenty-three thousand post of-
fices in the United States, of which number it is believed
that not less than ten thousand are held rather for the inci-
dental advantages they afford than for any psofit accruing
directly to the incumbents; some thousands more are held
by persons who are now content with the direct profit and
the incidental advantages, deiived ; many more are soueht
with avidity because the compensation is ample for the la-
bor and attention bestowed, and but a few, comparatively,
make an inadequate return for the services and responsibil-
ity of the incumbents. These last consist chiefly of dis-
tributing offices situated at points where the commissions
on delivery matter are insufficient to aid in compensating
the additional labor imposed by the duties of distribution.
Butthe proposed scale of commissions, whileit increases
the compensation of thousands of postmasters who neither
need nor expect it, affords no substantial relief to the dis-
tributing offices, where the labors performed are most oner-
ous, and the services rendered are of the utmost import-
ance to our mail system. Therefore, to give efficiency to
offices of this class, 1 would respectfully submit that it can
be done most readily and economically by restoring to the
PostmasterGeneral the power given him by the sixth section
of the act of 3d March, 1851, so far as to authorize him to
. make allowances from the 1st April, 1853, to distributing
offices, sufficient to cover their reasonable and necessary
expenses; provided the allowances so made shall not exceed,
by twenty per cent., the respective amounts allowed for like
purposes* in any previous year, at the same offices.
The Auditor estimates that the sum of $25,000 per an-
num would cover all the additional allowances necessary
to be made to the distributing offices ; but if they should
* reach $35,000 a year, still that mode of relieving them
would, in my opinion, be preferable on the scoie of econo-
my, to any general increase of the rates of commission.
Theieisyet another class of offices which require the
aid of Congress, called separating offices, which perform
service second in importance only to the distributing offi-
ces. They are situated at the termini or diverging points
of many mail routes., and they overhaul the mails and sep-
erate and bag the matter fot the different diverging routes.
Many of these offices are inadequately compensated, and,
therefore, I would commend the subject to your attention,
su^gestinc that the power to make additional compensation
,to such offices might be conferred, with the same limita-
tion as in the case of distributing offices. It will be seen
that the Auditor estimates that $20,000 per annum will be
sufficient to relieve offices of this class.
1 deem it my duty to use the present occasion to bring to
your notice the fact that the compensation of the postmas-
ters at the small offices was considerably reduced by the
operation of that provision of the <*Act to amend the act en-
titled ' An act to reduce and modify the rates of postage,'
&c.. appioved August 30, 1852, which declares that,
"When the postage upon any newspaper or periodical is
paid quarterly or yearly in advance at the office where the
iaid penodical or newspaper is delivered, or is paid yearly
or quarterly in advance at the office where the same 13
mailed, and evidence of such payment is furnished to the
office of delivery m such manner as the PostOffice Depart-
ment shall, by general regulations, prescribe, one half said
rates only shall be charged." This discount of fifty per cent,
allowed for prepayment, inures chiefly to the benefit of the
postmasters in the large towns and cities, where the pre-
payment is commonly made, and the countiy postmasters
have to deliver the papers and periodicals without any com-
pensation.
I have the honor to be, most respectfully, yours,
JAMES CAMPBELL, Postmaster General.
Hon. Edson B. Olds. Chairman Committee Post Ojflee
and Post Roads, House of Rejncsentatives,
"Now, Mr, Speaker, I will ask the Clerk to do
me the favor to read, in this connection, the esti-
mates of the Auditor of the Post Office Department,
referred to in the communication of the Postmaster
General:
Auditor's Office, Post Office Department, )
February 15, le54. $
Sir: fn answer to the interrogatories proposed in your
letter of the 14th instant, X have the honor to state—
1st. That if, instead of the commissions now allowed
upon letter postage, " the proposed rates" should be sub-
stituted, Irorn aud after the 1st April, 1853, the probable
effect would be to decrease the revenue for the year ending
31st March, 1^54, about $30i),000.
For the ba«is of this estimate you are respectfully re-
ferred to the accompanying statement marked A.*
The total amount of letter postage for the
Quarter ending 30thJune, 1853, was.. $1,121,679 19
Quarter ending 30tli September, 1853, was... 1,139,564 41
Estimated for 31st December, 1853, was  1,159,000 00
Estimated for 31st March, 1854, was  1,180,000 00
$* 600,243 60
Taking, then,.the additional commissions actually ascer-
tained for quarter ending 30th September, 1853, as the basis
of an estimate for the other quarters, the following will be
the result:
Quarter ending 30th June, 1853, estimated $73,819 00
Quarterending3oth September, 1853,ascertained 75,078 35
Quarter ending 30th December, 1853, estimated.. 76.416 00
Quarter ending 31st March, 1854, estimated  77,631 00
$302,944 35
2d. The number of accounts subject to resettlement prior
to those of the current quarter, should the proposed rates
take effect from and alter the 1st April, 1853, would be
sixty-five thousand one hundred and sixty-three, and the
additional clerk hire to effect this would not exceed the
sum of §3,000.
3d. If the sixth section of the act of 3d March, 1853, were
repealed, and the sixth section ufthe act of 3d March, 1851,

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient
servant, W. F. PHILLIPS.
Hon. James Campbell, Postmaster General.
With all due deference, Mr. Speaker, to th«
opinion expressed, and the deductions and infer-
ences made by the Postmaster General from the
estimates of the Auditor of the Post Office De-
partment, against the passage of the bill under
consideration, I beg leave on behalf of myself and
my colleagues on the Committee on the Post QfHee
and Post Roads, most respectfully to dissfent: and
will so far trespass upon the patience of the House',
as to notice each particular objection made by the
head of the Post Office Department, to the bill re-
ported by the committee.
By this exhibit, Mr. Speaker, the auditor for
the Post Office Department, estimates that the bill
which I have just reported, will increase the ex-
penditures of the Department $75,035 35 per quar-
ter, or $302,944 per annum.
The Postmaster General very pertinently puts the
question, " Whether the public interest really re- N
quires the expenditure of so large a sum upon the
post offices at a time when large additions to the
mail facilities are demanded in all parts of the
country, and more especially in the newly-settled
States and Territories?"
With all due deference, Mr. Speaker, to the
opinion of the Postmaster General, I am utterly
at a loss to know what the ic demand for increased
mail facilities/'has to do with the adjustment and
graduation of commissions to the postmaster^ of
the offices already established, so that they may
receive compensation adequate to the labor per-
formed, and the responsibility incurred; unless,
indeed, Congress ana the Postmaster General still
act upon the hypothesis, that the Post Qffice De-
partment should be a self*sustaining Department
of the Government.
If, Mr. Speaker, we are to return to such a
theory, you should apply the pruning hook, not to
the postmasters, who are the poorest paid of all
classes of Government officials, but to the excres-
cences which Congress has fastened upon the
Post Office Department. If, sir, this branch of
our Government is to be a self-sustaining Depart-
ment, do away immediately with your franking
privilege, «nd let everything which passes
through and in the mails of the United Slates, pay
its proper tribute to that Department towards its
maintenance. Sir, the friends of cheap postage
are constantly pointing us to Great Britain, where
the cheap-postage system is in operation, and
where the post office department not only sus-
tains itself, but is actually a source of revenue
to that Government. But do these gentlemen
understand that nothing passes through the
mail of Great Britain without paying postage?
Do they understand that the Postmaster General
of Great Britain, the members of Parliament, the
, House of Lords, and even the Q,ueen herself, is
j denied the franking privilege, and must pay post-
' age the same as the humblest subject? Do gen-
tlemen really understand that the free matter
which leaves the post office in this city abstracts
from the revenues of the Post Office Department
a million and a half of dollars annually?
I repeat, Mr. Speaker, if you desire to make the
Post Office Department a self-sustaining branch
of the Government, do away with the transmission
of all free matter through the mail, and by this
single operation, you will increase the revenues" of
the Department more than two and a half millions
of dollars annually.
