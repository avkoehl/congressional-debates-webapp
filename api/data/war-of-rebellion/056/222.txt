CHATTANOOGA, November 21, 1863.

Colonel T. J. HAINES,

Chief Commissary, Saint Louis, Mo.:

There is a force of seven or eight regiments at Eastport, and of course no necessity for burning rations. I have, however, ordered all the troops there, except three regiments, to come by water to Nashville, and any surplus rations should be sent to that place. General Sherman commands that department.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, November 21, 1863.

Admiral D. D. PORTER,

Mound City, Illinois:

I meant to let transports return and go about their business, or wherever the quartermaster might have previously directed them. Now I want to change that order. Please send this immediately up, and direct all transports turned back to Eastport and take on board all the troops there, except the garrison left by General Sherman, and bring them to Nashville with all dispatch.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

CAIRO, November 21, 1863.

Major-General GRANT:

Your dispatch of the 21st received, and on the way.

D. D PORTER,

Rear-Admiral.

WASHINGTON, D. C., November 22, 1863-11 a.m.

Maj. General U. S GRANT:

The Secretary of War directs that Brig. General R. B. Mitchell be ordered here immediately for temporary duty. Please acknowledge.

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CHATTANOOGA, November 22, 1863.

Maj. General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Chattanooga:

You will please have the steamer Dunbar wooded by 10 o'clock this p.m. with dry wood sufficient to run her to-night and to-morrow. If dry wood cannot be obtained in any other way, you will take old buildings. You will also have her manned with a crew of soldiers who have had experience in steam-boating. Place her subject to the orders of Brig. General W. F. Smith, chief engineer.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
