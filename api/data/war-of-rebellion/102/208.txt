Major HANNAHS,

Saint Louis:

Jeff. Thompson is reported by Captain Colbert's scouts at Harrisburg, Ark. He is also reported with 400 men between Patterson and Fredericktown. There is some force in there. I move at once Colonel Hynes with 400 men and one section of artillery in pursuit by way of Dallas, to fall in the rear, and directed Colonel Malone to collect his forces and harass him in front. Will look after Hildebrand when this affair is ended. I would ask another company of infantry be sent to the Knob.

Brevet Brigadier-General.

Lieutenant Colonel F. M. MALONE:

Make such disposition of Captain Smith's force as you deem best. Major Hannahs telegraphs, "Infantry will be sent to the Knob. De Soto is not in my command. " I will ask Hannahs to send them down temporarily, when you request, in case of great need. Get your recruits down and arm them, Advise Potosi and Mineral Point to be on the alert, if our communications are broken. Keep Hannahs posted of the state of affairs.

Lieutenant Colonel F. M. MALONE,

Commanding, Pilot Knob, Mo.:

On yesterday evening I sent Lieutenant Wildey with ten men in pursuit of a reported force of rebels under command of Jeff. Thompson, with positive orders to report to me by messenger should he learn any news regarding the enemy. I have not heard from him since. he is either captured or had me and defeated the reported Jeff. and his command. There is nothing like a scare when guerrillas wish to steal horses. I yesterday received information that there were 200 rebels on Bear River. This morning from the neighborhood citizens report there were only seven. I received orders this morning from Saint Louis to have Lieutenant Weston and four men sent to Saint Louis to attend court-martial. Shall I send them or not? Wagons leave here in the morning at daylight.

JAMES SMITH,

Captain, Commanding Post.
