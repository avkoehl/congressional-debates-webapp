25-th CoNtG„....lst Sess.                            Making public officers depositories—Mr. Garland.                                          H. of ReppsT
and soundness Whether we shall ultimately recur
to an exclusive metallic system, andin anticipation
prepare for that event, deserves consideration of
more than ordinary gravity and the exercise of
extraordinary sagacity
The system oí deposites adopted from the foun-
dation ol the Government, and which has prevailed
to the present horn, whether it was practicable, is
the bank system This fact accompanied with the
expressed opmsons of every incumbent of the
Treasury Department until the present time proves
conclusively to every reflecting mind, that it
was regarded as the safest, most economical, and
most convenient system, without thi> means of
keeping the public money, it must have been kept
and distributed by individuals, and subject to all
the extravagance, insecurity, and liability to defal-
cation which has ever attended individual receipts
and disbursements All preceding Secretaries,
and many of our most distinguished men of the old
republican school, declared their opinions m favor
of the plan now pioposed It is remarkable, that
a system so republican, so safe, and so innocent as
that now proposed, should never have been pro
posed for the adoption of Congress, by any preced
ing administration, or any preceding Treasury De-
partment, if it had been viewed in its present favor-
able and superior light, it certainly would have
been recommended, but as it was not, I regard the
omission to do it, as conclusive evidence that it was
not approved The only difficulty which has ever
prevailed, has been between the selection of a na-
tional and State banks, some preferring the former,
some the latter There being now no national
bank, the question of preference is directly present-
ed between the State bank sjrstem and the sub
treasury system, recommended by the Executive
The State bank system stands preferred, not only
by the practice of the Government, but the expiess
ed opinions of many of our most able and distm
guished patriots and sages In the year 1791, after
the passage of the act incorporating the fiist Bank
of the United States, Mr Jefferson, m his official
opinion to General Washington, as a member of
his cabinet upon the constitutionality of that act,
resisted the argument of the necessity of that bank
as the fiscal agent of the Government, on the ground
that these facilities would be afforded by the State
institutions, m that opinion he expressed himself
thus^
"Perhaps, indeed, batik bills may be a more convenient
vehicle than Treasury orders, but a little difference m the do
gree of convenience cannot constitute the necessity, which the
Constitution makes the ground for as«ummg any non enumer
ated power
"Besides, the existing banks will without a doubt, enter into
arrangement  fer lending their agency , and the more favorably
as there will be a competition among them foi it, wheieas the
bill delivers us up hound to the national bank who are Iree to
refuse all arrangement, but on their own teims, and the public
not free, on sach refusal, to employ any other bank '
Mr MadisoD, in his able and unanswerable speech
in opposition to the charter of that bank, said
" But the proposed bank^could not even be called necessary
to the Government, at most, it could be but convenient Its
uses to the Government could be supplied by keeping the taxes a
little in advance , by loans from individuals, by the other banks
over which the Government would have equal command nay,
greater, as H may erant or refuse to these the privilege, made a
free and mevocable gift to the proposed bank, 01 u^ins their
notes m the federal revenue "
The arguments urged in favor of the char er of
this bank were principally those of it> s- fety, econ-
omy, and convenience as a depository and dis-
burser of the public money This was a most pro
pitious peno i m our history to have adopted a
system of individual agencv, and withheld all con-
nexion with banks if it had b en deemed safe,
economical and convenient When the question of
the renewal of the charter of that bank was under
consideration, a memonal was íeferied by the
House of Representative praying the renewal of
the ehaucr of that bank In h s report upon that
memorial, in enumerating the advantages of the
bank o the Government, he speaks of the safe keep-
ing of the public monejs thus
' 1 Safe keeping of the pub icmnneys—Thisapphesrotonly
to moneys already n the Iteasuiy buta w totho-^e nthe hant^
of the pr ncipal collactors, ol the commis loners of the loin*,
and of several other officer'', and atfords une of the best peeun
ties against delinquencies "
It is true that Mr Galla'm was speaking of a na-
tional bank, yet the principle is the same m reier
ence to the plan proposed, for that stakes a' all
banks, national or State But to p,ove that while
this distinguished financier preferred a national to
State banks, he preferred a State bank to an indi-
vidual egeaey, I hare uuwa from his report to a
committee of the Senate of the 30th of Januarys
1830, upon the same subject —Hi says,
' The banking system is now fiimly established , and, in its
ramifications, extends to every part of the United States    Under
that system, the assistance of banks appears to me necessary
for the punctual collection of the revenue, and for the ■"ale keep
ing and transmission of jmbhe moneys    That punctuality of
payment is principally due to banks, is a fact generally acknowl
edged     It is to a certain degree, enfoiced by the refusal of
credit at the custom house, so long as a formei revenue bond,
actually due, remains unpaid    But I think neveithefess that,
moidertoensure that precision in thecollecton, on which de
pendo a coirespondmg discharge of the public engagements, it
would, if no use was made of banks, be found neccssaiy to
abolish, altogether, the credit now given on the payment of
duties—a measure which would affect the commercial capital,
and fall heavily on the consumers    That the public moneys are
safer, by being weekly deposited m banks instead of a cumu
latmg in the hands of collectors, is self evident    And their
ti ansnnsaion whenever this may be wanted, lor the puipose of
making payments in othei places than these of collection, cannot,
with any convenience be effected onalaigescale niaiiexten
sive countty, except through the medium of banks, or of per
sons acting a* bankeis
' The question, therefoie is whether a bank lticorpoiatedbv
the United States, or a number of banks, incoiporated by the
several States be most convemen' for those purposes
"State banks may be used, indmust, m case of a non renewal
of the charter be used by the Treasuty-"
In this paragraph is found the expressed and de-
cided opinion of Mr Gallatin, not only that the
banking system is firmly established, but that if there
be no national bank, the Government must resort to
State banks, and that the public moneys are safer m
banks in than accumulating m the hands oí mdi
viduals, the opinion is entitled to great weight, as
coming from a most able and experienced financier
In addition to these, I refer to the opinions of
several distinguished republican members of this
House, in the session of 1810, upon the same sub
ject
Mr Burwcll said
" I «"aid sir it must be shown that the bank n necessary to the
operations of the Government without its aid oui fiscal con
cerns cannot be managed So far from subscribing to the neces
sit} of the bank I believe the rcvemn would be equally safe in
in the State banks and coald be dtstitbuted witn inconsi let able

Ml  Eppes said
'The creatien of a bank with a capital of $10 000 000, almos'
fire times the capital of all the existing banks of the Union,
undei the patronage of the General Government, was <*alcu
lated to produce and did produce a subserviency on the pan of
the stockholder to the views of their party The influence of
this powerful money capital wis long felt Nothing but the
multiplication of tstate banks and the increase of capital fiom
the peculiar and foitunate cutumstances under which the
United States were placed could have emancipated us from the
shackles imposed on us by a moneyed interest wielded by for
earners '
Mr Giles said
"I cannot see how pt tug down this institution can maten
a'iy affect the pecuniary abilities of the nation , its actual lunds
for discounting will be nearly the «ame , the position of them

upon the chai ter of the late bank, the «ame opinions
weie expressed n favor of Stat" bank, by many
able and distinguished gentlemen It isremarka
ble that m the whole range of debate, at the two pe-
riods referred to, no gentlemen, so far as 1 recolkfet,
expiessed the slightest inclination to resort to the
sub treasury system
The administration of General Jackson exhibits
still stronger and more conclusive proof of the'sit-
penonty of the State bank deposite system over
any other which the "it,tt of man, could devise"
Indeed, so little was the sub treasury system in favor
that w hen the removal of the deposites was de-
tei mined upon, it did not enter into any considera-
tion, as far as we are informed, but the State banks
w ere recommended and selected, as being m every
point of view equal to the Bank of the United States,
as fiscal agencies and, ui a political point of view,
infinitely safer—the comparison being instituted be-
tw een a national and State bank alone    In General
Jackson s expose to his cabinet on the-------day of
Septembei after reviewing the advantages and dis-
advantages of the United States and State banks in
contrast, sav s
' The Pi evident thinks these facts and circumstances afford
as sti ong a guarantee as can be had in human affairs, for
the safety of the fiublu funds, and l/ie practicability of a new
system of coltrclion and almoinsement thioutrhthe ae-encv of
Mate banks.'                                             *
Language could not be more unequivocal of the
preference of the State bank svstem over every
other yet the Pi esident seems to be aware that dan-
ger luiks m all human sjstems, and that this system
might be d,soldered from those causes which are in-
cident to human fiailtj If there could be a lin-
gering doubt upon the mind of any man that the late
President designed the State banks as the perma-
nent system of the Government, it wijl be removed
by the following extracts from his annual message,
of December, 1834
1 Tne attention of Congress is earnestly invited to the
J emulation of the deposites in the State banks "
In the same message he expresses himself thus
" Happily it is already ll ustrated that the agency of such
an ins itutionythe United States Bank\is not necssary to
ttiefitc doperait nsof the Oorer unent The Stale bunks are
found fully adfqiiatr to the performance fall seirices which

tamed thcmseli.es and dtscha ged all then duties, while the
Bank of the United States was Ml powerful, and tn the
field as an open enemy and it is not possible to conceive that
they icillfind greater difficulties when that enemy shall cease
to exist
In his annual message to Consress m December,
1835, General Jackson expresses himself thus
"By the use of the &tate bunks which do not claim their
chattel fio n the General hove nment and ate no'control
ed m its At,TiiorliY ills 4SCEHTAISED that the meneys of the
United State* can be collected and disbitsed without loss

In the annual message of December 1836, which
was the last Gene-al Jackson delivered aftei the
emanation of the Tieasury Cii rular, íeqjinng gold
and silver for the purchases of the public lands, and
a full knowledge of the facts upon which that ordei
was deemed necessary, in the following strong and
emphatic terms, he expressed his unabated confi-
dence in the State bank sj siem
