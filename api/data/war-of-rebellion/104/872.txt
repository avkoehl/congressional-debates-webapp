CIRCULAR.] HDQRS. SECOND DIV., CAVALRY CORPS,

MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,

Macon, Ga., May 22, 1865.

The officers and soldiers of this command are reminded that the war is virtually at an end, and consequently the persons and property of every citizen is sacred. Our march from the Tennessee River has been a triumphal one, and now forms a bright page in the history of our country. The march now before us is homeward; let it be one on which we can look back with pride, a march during which neither woman nor child has been injured or insulted. The colonel commanding trusts that every honest and honorable soldier will feel that he is the protector and defender of the weak and helpless and that the honor of the command is in his hands, not to be tarnished, but to have fresh luster added to it, and that every man will so act that all must acknowledge that the division is great in peace as in war.

By command of Colonel R. H. G. Minty:

T. W. SCOTT,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

CIRCULAR.] HDQRS. SECOND DIV., CAVALRY CORPS,

MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,

Macon, Ga., May 22, 1865.

The command will move to-morrow morning at 7'clock, 23rd instant, in the following order: First, Second Brigade; second, battery; third, First Brigade; fourth, the entire train of the division, under charge of Captain Coe, acting assistant quartermaster, Second Division. One company from the rear regiment will be detailed as rear guard to the train. If there are any dismounted men they will at once be organized into companies and battalions and not less than one officer be placed in command of every twenty-five men. These dismounted men will habitually accompany the wagon train. The number of men and names of officers will be sent to these headquarters by brigade commanders by 5 p.m. to-day. The command will have three days' rations and two of forage. Great care should be taken by officers and men that neither forage nor rations are wasted, as they will not, under any circumstances, be permitted to forage for the same. Nothing will be taken in the country over which we travel. Straggling will not be permitted and commanding officers of brigades are charged to take such measures as will prevent it. In passing through the city of Macon the command will march by fours, and no one will quit the ranks for any purpose whatever. The regiment in the city will join the command in town. Reveille will be sounded at 4 a.m.

By command of Colonel R. H. G. Minty:

T. W. SCOTT,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
