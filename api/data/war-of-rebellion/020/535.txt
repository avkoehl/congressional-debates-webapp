HDQRS. DEPT. OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA, Charleston, S. C., June 2, 1862.

Brigadier-General MERCER,Commanding Second Military District:

GENERAL: I have just received a telegram from General Gist, of which the following is a copy:

SECESSIONVILLE, S. C., June 2, 1862.

Seven additional gunboats in Stono, five at anchor outside, and others in sight. We may look out for the attack at any hour. Two of the vessels are reported transports.

S. R. GIST.

Have all troops notified and ready to move at a moment's notice; let the batteries look to their ammunition. Send proper persons to see they have all that is necessary. Every regiment should carry 40 rounds of ammunition and have in wagons as much more. You must throw another regiment over to General Gist and a field battery to be at hand; another regiment to man the lines east, at Newton's Cut, and an additional battery for the same part of the lines. If the enemy attempts to land he must be attacked to-night or whenever he leaves the cove of his gunboats. Cooks must be left in camp to keep the men supplied. Every man should fill his canteen with water before starting. Notify commanding officers of Sumter and Moultrie, Forts Johnson and Beauregard.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

JAMES ISLAND, Charleston S. C., June 2, 1862-9.30 p.m.

JEFFERSON DAVIS, President:

Twenty vessels are in and off the Stono and increasing in number. If they attack it will be by land and water. If you say risk it, I will order 5,000 men from Savannah, but I think it will be dangerous. I am now in the field. I have ordered them to be ready.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

CHARLESTON, S. C., June 3, 1862.

Brigadier-General LAWTON, Savannah, Ga.:

Send immediately to this point two more regiments, making in all three. Send General Smith with them.

Major-General, Commanding.

CHARLESTON, S. C., June 3, 1862.

GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

There are strong indications of a general attack on Charleston. I shall be obliged to draw largely on Savannah for troops. Can I get any from North Carolina?

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.
