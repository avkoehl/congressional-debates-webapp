SAINT LOUIS, MO., April 27, 1863.

General Vandever came on the enemy's rear near Cape Girardeau last night, attached and routed him, taking a large number of prisoners, horses, arms, &amp;c. The enemy retreat toward Bloomfield in great disorder, pursued by our victorious and combined forces of Generals vandever, and McNeil. I have telegraphed General Asboth at Columbus, asking him to strike a blow through New Madrid to prevent or embarrass their escape.
