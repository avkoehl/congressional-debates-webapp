which this bill should be reieired Mr M here referred to the

tS a member of that committee, Mr A wt uld certainly not
íhfftk of undertak ng to consider any othei system for the col
1 fion and safekeeping of the rev^r ue if he believed any other
e-ipHlieit, foi the reason that a select committee ha i been ap
pointed with the powers aiiealy alluded to Hut if this ie
pealing bill was to he passed, without providing anv sy&tem m
place ©*" the one contained m the present law, it suiely woald
not be contenáed that a nceeasity might not anee of making
some provision for the secunty of the public moneys in the in-
terval which was to ensue between the repeal of the existing
law and the adoption of another stfheme, whether that scheme
be a National Bank, or some fiscal agent, or other "nondescript
animal" alluded to by the gentleman from Ohio Certainly it
was a subject thatrequired -cautious examination, and as he
believed that, by the rules, it was among those usually confided
to the Committee of Ways and Means, he hoped the motion of
the chanman would prevail
Mi TIIXINGHAST thought, he said, that the bill should
go to the select committee That committee had been raised to
provide a substitute for the very measure which this bill pro
posed to repeal If that iepeal should take place, it would be
necessary to provide foi the deposite of the public treasure m
the mean time until the substitute went into operation He be
lieved that the chairman of the select committee [Mr Ser-
CrfcAMT] had had this subject on his mind There was in the
deposite law a piovision which deprived some of the very best
banks of the power of receiving the public money, and which
deprived theTreasuiy of the power of depositing money in
those banks A tnodification of that depositelaw ought, m his
opinion to be embraced m this repealing law, and he thought,
therefore, that it would require the action of that committee
which had been raised ior the purpose of reporting a substitute
Mr JONE^ of Virginia said he consideted the subject em
braced in the bill to be a legitimate subiect for the Committee
of Ways and Means, and he hoped the House would adopt the
or lei referred toby the chairan n, dnectmghim to submit the
application now pending Whether t ie subject wa° one
which fell within the cognizance o*" the committee would bo
made app treat by reading the rule oi the House which
pi escribes the duties of the Committee of Wajs and Means, as
follows
' It shall be ihe d ity of the Committee of Ways and Means
to take mto consideration all such reports of the Treasury I)e
partment and all such propositions relating to the revenue,
asmiy be refened to them by the Hou«e, tomqj into the
•nateof the public debt, or the levenue, and of i^ expendí
tures and to report, from time to time, then opinion 1 ereon "
Now Mr J would ask or  all sides, whether thoQj 3 which
was proposed tobe repealed by the bill on the table was not
the very bill which provided foi "the collt-ction, sai eepmg,
transfer,and disbursement of the public revenue," i d was
not one of the subjtctsieferred to in the iules"i There r uld be
no doubt on the subiect He believed it to be agiee 1 on all
hands that if the n'11 on 'he table «should become a hw, it
would revive the deposite bink system of 183o Had gentle
men taken the trouble to loot- at what would be the operition
of the act? Had they eirefuily considcied that the revenue of
the count  y would be placel upon that law which was pitied
under i state of things which did not nowexis ? All the banks
=!Outh of New York weie at present nun spe< ie paying, and
they could notieceive the public revenue neithei could those
funks which were payma specie, but issued notes of a less de
nomination than five dollars He a&ked then, whethei this
wn not a piopci subject folióme committee of the If use and
whethei it should not be male the duty of the Committee of
Ways and Means to examine it and provide the necessary
guaids tor the safo keeping of the public money, if the bib up
on the tibie should hoc me a law? He wa unwilling to see
the public tieaMire left foi a single day without some legal
restriction, md if he Ind the powei, it should not remain m
su(ha condition for a single hour As to the delay ef which
the gentleman Irom Maine [Mi Fessenoen] spoke he need
hive no apprehension on ie subject Flu y hada committee
which would act promptly on the bdl when the House shall
have r* feiced it to tlum The "-e-itleman coull not distrust the

the Committer of Way* and Means had a broadei acope
Mr T INN moved the previous question
The ^FCAKCR said the pievious question wou! i cut off the
motion lor n frrence, and would bring the Hou e directly to a
v«te on the bill
M  f INN withdiew his motion
And the question recurrmnr on the íefeience
Mr AlivVT^^id i appealed to him (hat the bdl belonged
propei ly to either or both of the committees named It was
not a bill simply to repealthe Sub Tceaamv Theie was ase
cond sí etion pi jvtdmg penalties foi the embezz'ement of the

com &eas to providing penalties it was a p-mal biP anl, a?
such, mustundeiffo the consideration of some committee and
t ot be acted en as if it were a matter i n which all agreed
These penalties were matters of serious and grave consideia
tmn for the Tlou^e they might be the best that eouidbe devised
—but «till they wete the subfecis of serious consideration 1>
the House, as he thousht pvery penal bill ought to be He
hoped, therefore th it the bill would be referred to some com
mittee For hisown pait, he should feel disposed to vote foi
hpndins it to the committee fiibtiaised, though he behev d that
it fell properly wtthn the jurisdiction ofboth
The purpose however, for which he had chiefly risen was to
move tl at the bill be printed He was surprised that the House
had not taken order to that effect The members of the House
did not known what the bill was    And he had been obliged to
go to the Clerk's tablet^ see what its provisions were To
whatever committee, therefore, it might be sent, he moved it be
printed
Mi PROFFIT called for the yeas and nays on the motion to
refer the bill to the Committee of Ways and Means
Mr F said that the responsibility of sending the bill to that
committee ought to rest upon the proper shoulders, constituted
as it was    He opposed the reference, and lemarked that here
after it might be important to know who sent the bill to the Com
mittee of Ways and Means
The House refused to order the yeas and nays
And the question on the motion to refer the bill to the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means, (which motion, by the rules,) has
precedence over the motion to refer to a select committee,)
was then taken and decided m the affirmative—ayes 109,
noes 77
So the bill was referred to the Committee of Ways and
Meanb
And the motion of Mr Adams having been also agreed to,
the bill was ordered to be printed
