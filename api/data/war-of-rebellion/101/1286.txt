Colonel HARDING,

Kansas City:

I have sent Captain Peery to Warrensburg to fit up his new company. I have not a single mounted man left. There were about twenty-five of the bushwhackers that came up last Sunday. From what I hear they have scattered in the Sni Hills. The horse equipments for Captain Eads' company have been shipped and I have enough horses here to mount his men. I would be glad that he could be relieved as soon as possible at Hickman Mills to fit up.

Messengers from Captain Wyckoff have just arrived. They left the captain with his company north of Kingsville this morning on the bushwhackers' trail. He will follow them into the Sni Hills and do what he can. He sends me word that there are from twenty-seven to thirty of the bushwhackers, badly mounted.
