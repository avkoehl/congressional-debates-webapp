J. R. MUHLEMAN,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. SECOND DIV., TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Dunlap, August 31, 1863.

Brigadier-General HAZEN,

Comdg. Second Brig., Second Div., Twenty-first A. C.:

GENERAL: With this you will receive the order under which Grose and Cruft will move to-morrow morning. A guard will be left here (your own) in charge of your baggage. You will order it at once to join you. You will move the Sixth Ohio as early as possible, that it may join Grose as soon as possible. General Crittenden thinks your artillery will embarrass you in your future movements. If you are of this opinion you will order it to move with the Sixth Ohio to join the division. I leave you very bare of supplies, but Peck will be here before you will need supplies. I take all from here not now issued. I hope you may get Chattanooga, and that I may speedily see you again.

Very respectfully,

JOHN M. PALMER,

Major-General, Commanding.
