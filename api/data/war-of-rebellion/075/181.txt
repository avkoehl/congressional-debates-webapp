NASHVILLE, May 14, 1864.

Colonel E. LONG,

Commanding:

Are you ready to move? If so, the general telegraphs that you are needed in his direction and wishes you to move at once.

R. M. SAWYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,May 14, 1864-1 a. m.

General SCHOFIELD:

Your note of 9.50 p. m. [13th] is received by Captain Twinning, which was the first knowledge the general commanding had of your connection with General Thomas. He has sent you instructions for to-morrow by courier. General Howard reports nine miles south of Dalton.

Yours, &amp;c.,,

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,May 14, 1864-7 a. m.

General SHERMAN:

Your dispatch of 11 p. m. yesterday, containing instructions for to-day, was not received until after 6 a. m. I had a regiment all night at the intersection of the Rome and Calhoun roads, and the center of my line rests on the Calhoun road. I am reconnoitering toward Dalton to see if I can communicate with Howard. From present appearances I will be able to support Thomas toward the right. I will be ready to move toward the mouth of Snake Creek the moment you so order.

Respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,May 14, 1864-8.45 a. m.

General SCHOFIELD;

Your dispatch of this 7 a. m. is received. Your position is a good one and you may retain it, connecting strong with Palmer or Thomas. I suppose Howard will come into your rear as support. In consequence of our line having swung round to the right I will move south by the right flank. I have sent Captain Poe to explain, so you will remain as now, and McPherson will secure a crossing at Lay's and operate on the enemy's line of retreat. All well here.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
