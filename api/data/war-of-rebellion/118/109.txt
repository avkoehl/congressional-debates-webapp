General CHARLES W. HILL,

Adjutant-General of Ohio, Columbus, Ohio.

GENERAL: In reply to your letter of the 6th instant addressed to the Adjutant-General have the honor to state that Lieutenant - Colonel Ludlow, agent for the exchange of prisoners, will have an interview with the agent from Richmond in the early part of next month when an exchange of all prisoners on parole on either side will be arranged as far as numbers will warrant it.

I will forward your list to Colonel Ludlow.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,
