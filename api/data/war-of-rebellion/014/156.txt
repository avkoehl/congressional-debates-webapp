Flag-Officer, Commanding North Atlantic Blockading Squadron.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, Va., May 9, 1862.

General LORENZO THOMAS,

Adjutant-General, Washington:

General McClellan desires that the chief of the Topographical Burean should send him eight or ten officers junior to General Humphreys, to move with his army until it reaches Richmond.

You will please order it to be done, if it can be.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, Va., May 9, 1862.

Major-General McCLELLAN:

The Topographical Engineers will be sent, if they are to be had. Orders have been given to that effect. Your report as to the rebel steamers up the James River agrees with information direct from Norfolk. We have official reports from Bulter and Farragut of the capture of the Forts Jackson and Saint Philip and the occupation of New Orleans by our forces.

Major General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: The Galena, Aroostook, and Port Royal engaged two batteries yesterday, each of about ten guns. We silenced the first at Rock Wharf, and finding the second one, at Mother Line's Bluff, took too many shell, the Galena laid abeam of the battery as close as the pilot could take her, so as to disconcert the aim of the rebels while the wooden gunboats ran by, which they did successfully, when the Galena also went up. The Yorktown and Jamestown, lying between these batteries, moved up the river as we approached them.

I hear that the Galena was well handled. She is now aground. I hope to get off this evening, but it depends upon the tide, which is irregular in amount.

Very truly, yours,

JOHN RODGERS.

WAR DEPARTMENT:
