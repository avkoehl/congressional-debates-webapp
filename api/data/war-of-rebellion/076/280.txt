General THOMAS:

Try and thin your strong lines as much as possible to-morrow, so as to make good reserves for action. Let these reserves be ready to move at any moment. Our cavalry surely will reach the Macon road to-night, and to-morrow the enemy will do something desperate.

General THOMAS:

Let two of your Napoleons or 20-pounder Parrott batteries keep up fire on Atlanta all night, each battery throwing a shot every fifteen minutes, partly for effect and partly as signal to our cavalry.

Cheatman's division had gone off to oppose our right, leaving his pickets. The enemy showed at least a continuous line of troops in their works on my front, and moved men rapidly from General Geary's or General Newton's front to the opposite General Wood's right, where they were most seriously threatened.

The prisoners were taken principally by Gibson's brigade. We had 1 man killed and a few wounded. The rebels can very easily reach our skirmish line with canister. I think any attack
