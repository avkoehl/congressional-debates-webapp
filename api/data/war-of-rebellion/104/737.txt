Brigadier General H. M. JUDAH,

Near Kingston, Ga.:

If Wofford's men will seek employment from the Western and Atlantic Railroad Company they will probably be set to work between Atlanta and the Etowah. The lieutenant-general commanding is not in favor of the army doing more work on railroads.

TULLAHOMA, May 12, 1865.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

A guerrilla who on the night of the 6th instant murdered two of my scouts, shot a number of loyal men, robbed them of everything they had, even women's and children's clothes, ravished one loyal lady, with fifteen of his gang, and made a similar attempt on an orphan girl sixteen years of age in the same room with the corpse of her cousin, whom they had killed, and who has taken the oath several times, has sent in to know if the comes under your orders. I consider him and his gang demons incarnate. Will forward testimony. Shall I allow them to come in on your terms? Please answer soon. The parties spoken of above had to borrow clothes to bury their dead, so destitute were they left.

R. H. MILROY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, May 12, 1865.

Major-General MILROY,

Tullahoma:

Send word to the guerrilla you mention that he is an outlaw and will not be permitted to come in under the order of General Thomas. Send a man to follow this messenger secretly to ascertain where he is, and let a party of sufficient strength to capture the gang follow the second man and try to capture the outlaws.

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General.
