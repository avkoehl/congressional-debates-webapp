PROSPECT, TENN., May 9, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON, Decatur, Ala.:

Will bring Seventeenth Wisconsin up here to-night and detain the train until morning. If scouts are not mistaken, this place is now threatened more than Athens. Do you want the Seventeenth Wisconsin to remain at Athens? Can't well ge there to-night, and if I am attacked I will need them, and if they are attacked they will be captured. Keep me advised and I will do the same for you. I think the demonstration on this place may be a feint.

W. Q. GRESHAM,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Huntsville, Ala., May 9, 1864.

Brigadier General JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Commanding at Decatur, Ala.:

Your dispatch is received. How is Gresham's force distributed? Places and number of men at each.

JNO. E. SMITH,

Brigadier-General.

DECATUR, May 9, 1864.

Major General J. E. SMITH:

I have received no report from General Gresham of the distribution of his force. He is at Prospect to-night with part of his command. One regiment is at Athens. I have telegraphed to know where the Seventeenth Army Corps is, but have not learned.

J. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

DECATUR, May 9, 1864.

Brigadier-General SMITH, Huntsville:

General Gresham has part of his command at Athens, part at Elk River, balance at Pulaski. Nothing new this morning. I am satisfied that it is a mistake that the force over the river is Roddey's command.

It must be Forrest.

J. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Huntsville, Ala., May 9, 1864.

Brigadier General JOHN D. STEVENSON, Decatur:

Direct General Gresham to send a brigade to Athens at once. Dispatches just received from General Sherman's headquarters that Grant had attacked the rebels on Friday, and drove them with great slaughter. Lee retired with our forces in full pursuit. Lee wounded, Jenkins killed, Longstreet and Pegram severely wounded. Butler within ten miles of Richmond. He occupies Petersburg, severing all railroad communication south of Richmond.

JNO. E. SMITH,

Brigadier-General.
