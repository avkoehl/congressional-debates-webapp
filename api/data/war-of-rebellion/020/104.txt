Shortly after our reigment had taken its position my company was subjected ot repeated volleys discharged from the thicket immediately in our front, which we had been informed was held by a company from Colonel Steves' regiment. On this account, in obedience to orders from Colonel Hagood, we did not reply for several minutes.

It is impossible for me to single out individual instances when all behaved with the utmost coolness and bravery, but I feel that it is but just to report the conduct of John Campbell Martin and T. Grange Simons, jr., as worthy of special notice. After being severely wounded they persisted in reloading and firing until overcome by exhaustion.*

I am, yours, respectfully,

R. A. BLUM,

Lieutenant, Commanding W. L. I., Company B, Eutaw Regiment.

Lieutenant-Colonel SIMONTON.
