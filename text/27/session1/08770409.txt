of workmen, they at lastresorted to the perilous potentiality of
paper money, not convertible into com, and fresh wonders

without soli I bapib of eoin On the 22d September, 17S9, in
what is entitled, m the volume of public documents, a circular
from the Secretary of the Treasury with regard to the receipt
and transmission by mail of bank notes, addressed to Otho H.
Williams, collector of the port of Baltimoi e, Secretary Hamil-
ton wrote "in consequence of arrangements lately taken with
the Bank of North America and the Bank of New York, for the
accommodation of the Government, lam to inform you that it
is my desne that the notes of these banks, payable either on de
mand or at no longer period than thirty days after their respec-
tive dates, should be received in payment of the duties as equi-
valent to gold and silver, and that they will be received from
you as such by the Tieasurer of the United States " The obvi-
ous illegalities of this Treasmy error are—1st, its sanction, with-
out iaw, of any bank notes, though eonveitible, 2d, its adop
tion of post notes, and, 3d, its assuming, as Secretary ofihe
Treasuiy, to control and answer for the Treasurer's reception
of such notes
But England had not then, by order in council or law, autho
nsed bank suspension of payment Prone as Hamilton was to
veneiare English Government, he had no conception of such a
violation of contracts and pei version of currency It is unjust
to chaise him with intentional introduction of paper for mo-
ney He fe't the serieus responsibility of a&suming the receipt
of even eonveitible bank notes, and never contemplated it but
asa temporary expedient In his report to the House of Re
presentatives, of the 22d April, 1790, he says so explicitly
The !tw which decíales that duties shall be received m gold
and silver com oidy was understood, this report declares, to ex
elude payments in the paper emissions of the particular States f
and seeming the immediate or ultimate collection of the duties
in specie, and to piohibit to individuals the right of paying in
any thing exceptgold andsilvei coin, butnot to hinder Treasu-
iy anangements for speedy command of the public resources,
compatible with the eventual receipt of the duties m specie
■such weie the reflections of theSecietary with iegard to autho-
rity to peimit banks notes to be taken m payment of the du-
nes But convinced of the usefulness ef the regulation, yet
considering the nature of the clause upon which the remarks
aribe, he thought it hi& dutv to bring the subject before the
eye of the House The measure is understood by all concerned
to be temporal y "
1 Indeed whenever i National Bank shall be instituted, some
new disposition of the thing will be a mattel of course " When
that Bank wab soon after incorporated, the sixteenth section of
the chalter made its notes receivable, in all payments to ihe
United States, oily when payable on demandm gold and stl>
vej The mere idea which has since come to be common,
was beyond the coucef tion of Alexander Hamilton, who would
have lefoisted bank notes with imcompiomising opposition, un
less the ieal representatives of money
