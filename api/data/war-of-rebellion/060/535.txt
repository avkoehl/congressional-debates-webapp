HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, SIGNAL DEPT.,February 7, 1864.

Major- General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

The following report has just been received, and is respectfully forwarded for the information of the general commanding:

PONY MOUNTAIN SIGNAL STATION,

February 7, 1864- 3. 30 p. m.

Captain NORTON:

I observe the enemy in heavy force at Raccoon and Morton's Fords, and occupy their line of intrechments between those places and for 3 miles east of the latter ford. Beyond that point can discover only pickets. Two batteries are in position near Mountain Run. Their camps in rear of the above- named fords appear not to have been disturbed. I judge full two brigades to be in support of the batteries at Somerville Ford. The condition of the atmosphere prevents more extended or clearer observation.

PAINE,

Captain and Signal Officer.

Very respectfully,

L. B. NORTON,

Captain and Chief Signal Officer, Army of the Potomac

PONY MOUNTAIN, February 7, 1864- 7. 15 p. m.

Captain NORTON:

Are there any signs of a movement to the rear!

PAINE.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 7, 1864- 8. 15 p. m.

Captain PAINE:

No signs of any move either way. Ours was only a reconnaissance. Let me know when you open with Castle.

NORTON.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,February 7, 1864- 7. 30 a. m.

Major- General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy discovered our withdrawal about 3 or 4 a. m., and made such efforts to get between my little party over there and the river that the y were withdrawn. Now he has advanced a strong line of skirmishers to about 100 yards of the stream, and again covers our approach to the ford. I may try to harass them a little with artillery.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 7, 1864- 6 a. m.

General BIRNEY:

It would be better, as soon as it is daylight, to close up on Newton.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major- General, Chief of Staff.
