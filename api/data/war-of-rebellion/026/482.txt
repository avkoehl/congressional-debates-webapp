FORT MONROE, VA., December 14, 1862.

P. H. WATSON, Assistant Secretary of War:

The arms brought here by the Pennsylvania drafted militia are for the most part the altered flint- lock musket, caliber .69. They were reported to me unfit for service. Lieutenant Baylor will inspect those at Newport News to-day and at Suffolk to-morrow, and a special report will be made. I do not desire any fancy arms, or even rifled muskets. Safe and serviceable rifled Springfield smooth-bores, caliber .69, are perfectly satisfactory.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, December 14, 1862.

Major General JOHN A. DIX:

Have fully talked over with General Halleck affairs, as you desired. He says he wants us to occupy the enemy on the Blackwater and keep as many of them there as possible. He thinks we have done all we could with the means there. Attacks and demonstrations so as to keep the enemy busy and alarmed. The four regiments you spoke of he wishes me to say are for you, and to make such disposition as you deem best.

If you decide to give them to me I would suggest that their removal to Suffolk will be much to their advantage.

At Willard's until morning.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

Washington, December 16, 1862.

Major General JOHN A. DIX, Fort Monroe, Va.:

General Banks organized his own command and it was supposed he had taken Corcoran's brigade. He failed to report what troops he took with him. As the brigade is in your department it will be considered under your command.

General-in-Chief.
