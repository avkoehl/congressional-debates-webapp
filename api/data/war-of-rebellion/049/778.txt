HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA,Dublin, October 8, 1863.

Brigadier General JOHN ECHOLS,

Commanding First Brigade:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to say that if the enemy is at Bowyer's Ferry in no larger force than represented in your letter of the 6th instant, he can see no reason to prevent your organizing a force to drive them off without [delay.] They should be allowed neither to construct boats nor clear out the roads. You will immediately prepare to attack this force, unless you have very urgent reasons against this course.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

Your dispatch received. Report indicates the enemy will attempt a raid north of James River. Troops should be withdrawn from south side to meet it.

R. E. LEE.

RICHMOND, VA.,

October 9, 1863.

General PICKETT,

Petersburg, Va.:

Information received excites suspicion that a raid in force is contemplated by enemy toward Weldon or on the north side toward Hanover Junction. Movements are not yet sufficiently decided to enable us to decide which is the design. It may be contemporaneous on both points. Under the circumstances, it is recommended, while retaining force on watch at Weldon, you concentrate such other as you can command at or near Petersburg ready to be thrown either way.

S. C. [COOPER.]
