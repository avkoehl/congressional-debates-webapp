HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Bolivar Springs, August 29, 1863.

C. GODDARD,

Asst. Adjt. General, Department Headquarters:

The transfer of Lieutenant Guenther from this department leaves the Fifth U. S. Artillery (First Division) deficient in officers I learn incidentally that Captain G. A. Kensel, of this battery, is acting chief of ordnance on Major-General McCook's staff, Twentieth Army Corps. I respectfully ask that Captain Kensel be ordered to join his battery at once. Captain Lodor was temporarily detached, and is now permanently assigned to duty in the Twenty-first Army Corps. I suggest that, so far as practicable, each corps supply its own details of both officers and men.

Very respectfully,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Stevenson, August 29, 1863-1.30 a.m.

Major-General McCOOK:

The general commanding directs you, immediately on receipt of this order, to make preparations for crossing the Tennessee River. Throw your brigade, now at Caperton's Ferry, across the river on pontoon-boats, at early dawn, and direct it to occupy the crest of the mountain, and take up a good defensive position, and, if necessary, throw up light intrenchments. Construct the bridge as soon as possible after the brigade is across. Send another brigade to take up a position at this end of the bridge. General Crook will throw over a portion of his brigade at daybreak, between Island Creek and Cox's Ferry. General Reynolds crosses a small force at Shellmound; General Brannan another at Jasper. Two regiments of cavalry will cross at Bridgeport. It is not probable you will meet with much resistance. Report progress frequently.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.
