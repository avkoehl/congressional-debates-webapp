General Rousseau has just arrived. Wheeler and his main force crossed the Tennessee River at the Shoals on the 10th. Parties of them have been crossing also at Savannah, as I learn from Captain Shirk, of the Navy. Another force of from 2,000 to 3,000 rebels, under Williams, reported to be much demoralized and out of ammunition, is in White County, east of Murfreesborough. General Burbridge is about starting to destroy the salt-works near Abingdon, Va., taking Gillem along.
