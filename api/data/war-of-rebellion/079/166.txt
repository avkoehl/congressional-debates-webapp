GENERAL FIELD ORDERS HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE, No. 18. Near Kenesaw Mountain, October 9, 1864.

Whilst uniting in the high commendation awarded by the general-in- chief,* the Army of the Tennessee would tender through me its most hearty appreciation and thanks to Brigadier General J. M. Corse for his promptitude, energy, and eminent success in the defense of Allatoona Pass against a force so largely superior to his own, and our warmest congratulations are extended to him to Colonel Tourtellotte, and the rest of our comrades-in-arms who fought at Allatoona, for the glorious manner in which they vetoed "the useless effusion of blood. "

A dispatch just received from Resaca states that 1,000 rebel cavalry are between Villanow and Snake Creek Gap and 100 guarding the gap. Information received from citizens. A train was run off track near Dalton to-night; I suppose a construction train sent down to convey cross-ties to Acworth.
