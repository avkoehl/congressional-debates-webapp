Captain W. C. RAWOLLE,Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: Colonel Waring has been grazing his horses about two hours. He is entirely out of ammunition, and is desirous of reaching his camp to-night. I think it advisable that he do so. Colonel Winslow is also out of ammunition, and should, I think, reach Germantown to-night.

LOUISVILLE, KY., June 13, 1864.

(Received 6. 50 p. m.)

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

At the request of General Ewing, I ordered from Nashville to Bowling Green two incomplete regiments of colored troops, to guard, in the present emergency, the Louisville and Nashville road. I will complete their organization and use them for recruiting purposes. The prospects is good for a large number of colored troops in this State. The Union men are decidedly in favor of it, believing this the only way to control and save the Union, and I care not for the opposition of the rebel citizens or Southern sympathizers.

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

Captain DICKSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A courier sent to Richmond yesterday, in search of Colonel Johnson returned this morning without finding him. From what information I can get, he has not left Irvine. I sent another yesterday, with orders to go until he found him.

Brigadier-General.

CAMP NELSON, June 13, 1864.

Captain DICKSON:

A courier from the detachment sent in pursuit of rebels says the rebels are making off toward mouth of Paint Lick, on Kentucky River. Captain Santmeyer, who sends dispatch, says they are reported 1,000 strong. Excitement is apt to exaggerate. The report is too big.

S. S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.
