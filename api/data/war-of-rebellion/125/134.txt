whole people of this country will be satisfied with the results of the effort for reorganization of the State government when it is completed, and that it cannot be rejected without throwing the power into the hands of the enemy North, if not South. The change that has occurred in this State since January, 1863, is without parallel in history. It has been far greater than could have been anticipated with reason, and it will become in two years, under a wise and strong government, one of the most loyal and prosperous States that the world has ever seen. I need not say, what you know so well, that Mr. Hahn and the gentlemen elected with him are earnest, faithful, and efficient friends of your Administration, who wait opportunity to serve your interests and that of the whole country.

On the 5th of March I expect to more in co-operation with Generals Steele and Sherman, or as soon as they may be ready, one or both. My own force is not sufficient to execute the orders of the War Department without the assistance of one or both. We are ready and impatient, expecting daily the word of command from either General Steele or General Sherman. A considerable number of troops have arrived here, fully enough to compensate for the loss we sustain by furloughs for veteran regiments. Our campaign will be decisive and successful.

I have the honor to be, with high respect, your obedient servant,

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General.

Inclosed you will please find an official copy of the vote as far as received. The aggregate will exceed 11,000 votes.

Your letter relating to the oath to be prescribed as a basis of the election did not reach me until a few days before the election. That adopted which was embodied in your proclamation of the 8th of December was the best that could have been offered, and was cheerfully, promptly, and generally accepted. One the constitution the vote will exceed 20,000.
