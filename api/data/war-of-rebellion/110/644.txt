There is not corn enough here to feed the transportation animals of the Hampton Legion from this to Asheville, and nothing on the road. Please send us corn and meat enough to take us somewhere, unless we can be supplied to make a campaign from here.

RICHMOND, March 21, 1864.

General JOHNSTON,

Dalton:

Recent Northern papers report Grant superseded Halleck, who becomes chif of staff. Sherman takes Grant's command. Your dispatch of 19th* does not indicate an acceptance of the plan proposed. The troops can only be drawn from other points for advance. Upon your decision of that point further action must depend.+

HEADQUARTERS LEE'S CAVALRY DEPARTMENT,Canton, March 21, 1864.

Brigadier General W. H. JACKSON,

Commanding Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: I am just in receipt of apparently reliable information to the effect that the enemy contemplate making a raid into Madison County to-morrow, 22nd instant, but nothwithstanding its apparent authenticity I am hardly inclined to credit the intelligence. Should you learn that the enemy have moved out, you will at once move down, if practicable, guarding the fords and making a dash toward Vicksburg, effecting what damage you can. If you are unable to effect anything toward.
