think they will next move across the road between Warren and myself as they press my lines. Two prisoners taken at different times say that all of Hampton's cavalry and a part of Hill's corps, or all of it, are in my front-one prisoners said Heth's division.

General MEADE:

Considering that the enemy intend to present any further destruction of the railroad, there is no great necessity of my remaining here, but it is more important that I should join Warren; but I do think, closely engaged as I am at present, I can not forced to do so before. Everything looks promising at present, except that, being in an inclosed position, the enemy are liable to pass between myself and Warren and I cannot determine the fact, so that Warren had better be watchful until I can make a practicable connection with him. I shall try to keep mu cavalry engaged to keep them off the plank road.

Major-General HANCOCK:

In addition to Mott's troops, I have ordered Willcox's division, Ninth Corps, to the plank road, where the Reams' Station road branches off. Willcox in ordered to report to you. I hope you will be able to give the enemy a good thrashing. All I apprehend is his interposing between you and Warren's forces ready for contingencies.

General HUMPHREYS:

The prisoners taken thus far belong to Wilcox's division and the cavalry. One of them says A. P. Hill over here about two miles this morning. There is nothing more than skirmishing going on just now. The enemy have attacked twice, once with McGowan's and once with Scales' brigade.
