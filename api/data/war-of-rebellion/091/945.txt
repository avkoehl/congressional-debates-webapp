town at once to notify the railroad authorities of the time the brigade will be there. The enemy were fighting McCausland's and Jackson's brigades of cavalry twelve miles from Gordonsville this afternoon. General Corse will go up to take command of Bratton's and Hunton's brigades when they reach there. When General Bratton arrives he will communicate will and co-operate with McCausland and Jackson. Should the enemy not have crossed the Rapidan River General Lee wishes the troops to march to Liberty Mills. Everything depends on your promptness in getting Bratton off.

HDQRS. DEPT. WESTERN VIRGINIA AND E. TENNESSEE,Wytheville, December 22, 1864.

Captain S. J. C. MOORE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: In the absence of Major-General Breckinridge, I respectfully ask that the engineer company commanded by Captain W. T. Hart, now on duty at Lexington, be ordered to this department. The recent raid of the enemy which has, in fact, not yet ceased in the western portion of the department, has resulted in the destruction of thirty bridges upon the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad and a number of turnpike bridges. It will require great energy to restore the railroad within two months, and until this is done operations in this department west of this point will be greatly impeded, unless the turnpike bridges are at once reconstructed. Requesting the early and favorable considerations of the lieutenant-general commanding,

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. STODDARD JOHNSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
