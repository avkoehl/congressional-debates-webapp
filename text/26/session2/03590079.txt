not cover the subject—it would not cover the
bill—no more cover it than aa inch .quare of
carpet would cover the ample area of this> cham-
ber The argument reaches no land but ihe
fragments and refuse to be found in. a few West-
ern States— he leavings after ten, twenty, thirty,
and forty 5 ear  of sale  in Mis«i s-ippi, Alabama,
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan This a all that
the argument reaches The bill, on the contrary,
extends to all Florida, as it stood wi h 1 s acci nt
limits, extend ng fiom the Atlantic to the Mis-
sissippi, and it extends to all Louisiana, in i!s
greatest conceivable extent, stretching from the
Mississippi to tbe Pacific ocean Such is
the difference between the argument and tbe
bill—such the immeasurable distance between the
argument and the subject If the argument was
good as fa- as it went—if the deeds of cession ac-
tually conferred an honty to divide among the
Stales the money received f r the lands which they
conveyed—sti'l it would be north nothing, foi the
bill ib not limited to the money 1-0 received It is
not limited to ih  lands mentioned in the ce «ion
acts, and if it was, no one woul 1 trouble himself
about it The revenue to be received from those
lands is too insignificant, too inconsiderable, too
contemptible, to le worth the trouble of distribu-
tion It lb nst to these fragments and lravi ¡gs that
the distribution paity lo"k They look to the rich
mine beyond the Mississippi—to the vast and fresh
domaiu of the ancient Louisiana, spreading from
the western bank of the Fa her of Floods to the
summit of the Rocky Mountains, and thenre to the
shore of the Pacific It is this to which the dtsiri-
but on patty look—it is this to wnich their bill ex-
tends and having n j title to this, not a word to say
in favor of any right to touch it, the alternative
S'enn to be to say nothing about it1 to e chew the
argument in toto, 10 quo'e the deeds of cession,
which have no relation to Florida or Louis ana,
and then re y upon those deed', and our ignoranc ,
to pa s an argutrent which has no foundation'
This seems to be }he resource of the who'e distri-
bution party, both on lb. s floor and elsewhere, and
the Senator from Ma sachusetts has not been able
to add an iota to what we have heard before
Mr. B «aid that he intended to bring ihis argu
me,nt to a practical test at a proper time—at the
time when the detail-of ihe distnbu ion bi 1 shall
be under considera tic n He should teen move to
limit the distribution to the lands e-ded by the
States, and if that proposition prevailed, there
would be an end of the matter, for there would be
nothing to divide, and no one would care to press
the matter. In using the word ce «¡un, 11 speak
mg of the cession act , and cession deed.,, Mr B
said, that he by no means admitted that any land
had been ceded, or conveyed by those acts to the
Federal Government They ceded nothing but a
right of purchase from tbe Indians, and every acre
of this land which had come into ¡he p< ?se sion of
the Federal Government, came by purchace from
the Indians—came by Indian treaties, and not by
State deeds—by payirg mon<-y for tbem and not
by gratuitous donation
Mr B said, that another argument, rot of con-
stitutionality, or even expediency, but of pity,
was brought to bear m favi r of this pebey It v. as
the distress of the States ' The Slpte, were said
to be in debt—to be in d s re=s—to need relief, and
the Federal Government is called upon to give 11
This was new and alarairg decirme to hi"n, it
was new and portentous, and whohy faeign to
the objects of the union, ard big with fa'al results,
either to ihe States themseivcs, or to tbe FeJeral
Government From temporary relief, either the
Federal Government ib«4 go on to ¿.rant pum.->-
nent supplies, and thus become tbe master of tlie
States, or the S'ates, from humble petitioners, must
become -uthonlative c!ai~ ant , must eventual y
demand as a right ft hat they asked as a favor, ard
end with mpstermg tbe Fe'eral Government by
stripping it cf ad its supplies Consolidation 01 the
States ison one hand, the dissolution of the Union
is en tbe other No one can foresee which danger
is to prevail, but all can foresee that tbe equili-
brium between the States and the Federal Govern-
ment is destroyed from the moment that they have
a common Treasury—from tbe moment thej look
to the same chest—and either party, no matter
winch, holds tbe keys of that chest From that
moment tbe equilibrium established by our Consti-
tution is destroyed, and one of the parties muu be-
come the master of the other
Mr President, continued Mr E I deprecate this
scene—this appan ion of the States at the bar 01
the Federal Government, m the character of dis-
tressed petitioners, praying for relief I regret to
see it I was bred in the political school of Na-
thaniel Macon, of John Randolph, and of olner
fa'hers of ihe Republic, who were stil on the stage
of action when I en ered upon it twenty years .-go,
and from them I learnt that if the Federal Givern
mert avoided debt, coiteated itself with light taxes,
preserved peace abroad, and kept open the channels
of commerce, it was doing its part, and the
¡states and the people would do the rest Ths is
what I vías accus'omed to he?r from tfae.e patiiots
and sages, and, tried by these principles, how s ands
the question of mi government or m srule between
tbe S ites and the Federal Government^ How
stands this quf stion? Cer amly more honorab'e to
the Government than ever s ond such a qu stion
between a Government and a people In p >mt or
debt, there is noth n —nothmsin the shape or form
of national debt, for a few millions ot outstand ng
Treasury notes, to be paid as due out of current
revenue, can form no exception to the proud decla-
tion that we have no nat onal debt In point of
federal taxes, we may be said to be almost free
from them Not a particle of direct, or internal
tax, exists by a law of the FeJcral Government
The duties on imported good-*, since the extinct oi
of the late nationil debt, hue gone down to al gbt
and moderate amoun' But few artic es are now
taxed high, the one-half are net taxed at all' Yes,
the one-half oí the whtlt of our loreign imports
are now free of duty—an a'vantage which no
other nation on ear|h po st!.ses, and whica we only
have enjoyed since ihe glorious administra ion of
General Jackson. As to peace, we have it with all
the world Our temple ot Janus is sha', ft r all tbe
nations of the eaith are at peace wi h our coun-
try and freedom oí int rcouise existing betw en
them Comm rce was 1 ever more safe—wa>
never so extei ded as it is at p esent Not ony all
the old channels of trade are open, but many rew
ones have been explored Our enterprisirg mer
chants now go m safe'y to pl3C3 whose ver) names
were unknown to their father0—to the ant pedes,
and to the poles—and no doubt at this instant,
while I stand here speaking, there are American
merchants en the oppjs te side of our world, sepa
ra ed from us by the eniire diameter of this glob",
and all pursuing their remote trade in safety, frre
dom, and peace Thus stands the question of mis-
govc-nment and misrule betveen the Federa1 G -
vernmenl snd the S'a'es It has con  its p rt, pud
nobly done its part by them—frped them foan
national dett—touched tbem 1 ghtly with tayes—
preserved peace for ih 111 ?b cud—kept open all
the channels of commerce and g icn to tvery n 1
zen, at noire and abroad, a clear si-st- an i lair
ploy for tbe exercise of bi alt nt and the par uit of
hs business Tfai. is fulfilh'-g tne ojjtct of its
creption, doing what t was crea ed to do t ccord

bred To to be} ond this—to become the patron of
the States, their treasurei, or the 11- almoner—to jn
der ake 'o relíete their di* re se-, b\ doling out mo-

to do an act for \ uicu he Federal Government
vas reie"- crea'fd, "rl which cannot be com-
menced without being eonii ued, and leading to
con=fqueac s lattl to the tudepei dence of on- cl
the parties
No, sir, the Fede al Government has ¿ol e |ts
part—¡as doñead that it ought to do f r the prcs
penty of the Sates, eic-pt in oni par icu'ar, and

mert, and, leading out the la'ge depos t- bpnks
which were forced w'o the roe,isu«e 1 y tbe distri-
bution piocess, and the weaker binks which ecu d
not resist a general movement, leavir-g out these,
and thes4«pension of 1837 wa« a levolt against tho
Democratic Administration, and the resalt of a con-
spiracy as regularly contrived as any conspiracy-
has been since the days of Catiline. Tws conspi-
racy was batched in the Bank of the United States,
and headed by its managers and its political confe-
derates Public opinion, and the coiduct of the New
York banks, prevented the permanent insurrection
which was intended—drove ths insurgent institu-
tions into temporary submission to the laws, to be
followed m 1839 by another revolt which con-
tinued, as- the first was des gned to continue, until
tbe Presidential election was over The Federal
Government did not put down these revolts, it did
n t reduce these insurgent corporations to subordi-
nation to the laws In that, and in that only, has
it failed in its duty to th" S'ates. But where was
the failure? Not m ths Federal head—not in the
representative of the Union—not in ihe President.
Mr Van Buren discharged hu duty—nobly—pa-
t 0 ically—wisely— firmly—courageously, dis-
charged it He recommended the remedy, the
const tutional, tbe adequate, the prompt remedy he
recommended tbe application of a bankrupt law
to bankrupt banks, and if it had been applied
when recommen led, the second suspension would
not have occurred The Bank of the United States
would have been wound up m 1839, and the dis-
tress and derangement of business, so injurious to
the country, and so beneficial to the bank party
during the election of 1840, would have been pre-
vented Tne Federal Executive recommended this
only measure which was wanting to the public
prosper^, Congress refused to pass it; and thus,
the only failure of the Government to do its dtty
was occasioned by the representatives of the States
themselves
Mr B d'pi-ecated the temper of the times, and
ihe gen< ral disposition which now existed to look
to tbe Federa' Government foi relief from distress,
and for favors and privileges of every kind This
