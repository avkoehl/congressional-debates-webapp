waken and rouse that fiery serpent which is de -
Uned—if the member's prino pies and policy be pur-
sued—if his will can have it so—one day to set this
nation in flames
For stating the fact that he is parhceps mmmu in
the wrong of this inequality, and for exposing the
motives of his inconsistent complaint of 11, he has
been allowed to respond to me in his usual strain of
violent inveciive and abuse, against all order of th s
House, and all propriety of debate. Wo sooner bas
the committee risen and repoited to the House, thin
the House refuses to vote the previous question, in
order to allow the member, out of order, 10 leply to
my remarks made in the committee, and, as usual,
to torture me with the lash of his scorpion tongue
This is not the first time that his frienJs, regardless
of him, have formed a ring around the vanity of
dotage, to hiss him on, like a bull dog of debito, to
lacerate my feelings, and ihen to cut me off from
the opportunity of defence by the previous question
