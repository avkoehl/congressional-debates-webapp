subsistence and forage they can carry on their horses via the Aqueduct and thence to Tennallytown, to await further orders. General Bayard has been directed to relieve your command at Falls Church, but you will not await his arrival. You will leave a staff officer to turn over your orders to him and to inform him where your men are posted, so that those you leave behind may be relieved at the earliest practicable moment. Those men will then be directed by the staff officer to follow you. You will also send an officer to your old camp near Fort Albany to order any of your troops that may have been left there to follow you rapidly. You will please make arrangements to have six days' subsistence and forage follow you. If the wagons are not at your command this can be arranged here. After you have given the necessary instructions you will report at General McClellan's house for orders with the least practicable delay. The duty about to be instructed to you is of the utmost importance.

General J. BUFORD,

Commanding Cavalry Brigade, near Upton's Hill:

(Care General Cox.)

General Bayard has been ordered to relieve General Pleasonton at Falls Church and to scout the country in his front and flanks. You will please make use of your available force in scouting that part of the country to the left of General Bayard as far as our extreme left near Fort Lyon. The commanding general desires you to give your personal attention to this matter, and wherever you find any approach on Bayard's left that is not patrolled by cavalry that you supply such patrol, so that all the roads within your district may be carefully watched and any approach of the enemy promptly reported. Until further orders you will be held responsible that all the roads within your district are carefully watched.
