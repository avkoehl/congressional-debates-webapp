This account of our national appropriations and
expenditures is faithful and true; and is fully il-
lustrated and confirmed by the unimpeached and
unimpeachable records of the whole country. No
ingenuity can falsify it. No sophistry can pervert
it. It must remain forever as a lasting refutation
and wholesome rebuke of all the idle, ungenerous,
and disingenuous charges which have been con-
tinually made against the present administration of
the Government.
I sigh, Mr. Chairman, over the frailties of poli-
tical ambition, and the degeneracy of partisan
mora's, when, in the very teeth of such authentic
and irrefutable evidence—evidence which proves
the sincere and persevering disposition of the Ad-
ministration party to keep the public expenditures
within the limits of a wise and wholesome economy
—we daily witness the bold, ceaseless, and unscru-
pulous efforts of the Federal party to distort facts—
to reprobate the very expenditures which they
themselves did publicly advise—to cast on others
the evil and the odium of a public prodigality
which they themselves created and continually sus-
tained by their own recorded speeches and votes—
to barter the refined andendnring gold of private
and national justice for the acquisition of some
trashy capital in hand; and to reverse the  proper
positions, and the faithful lights in which the
muse of history should record the character and the
actions of our public men.
No force should resist, no art repress, nor sub-
terfuge avert the public indignation, when reckless,
factious partisans desperately determine to govern
or to ruin a great and prosperous nation. Truth,
virtue, patrio'ism, and wisdom, give a preferable
title to command the councils of a free, enlighten-
ed people; and must always lie at the bottom of
national glory and felicity.
No party, however emulous of rule, or exalted
in authority, can venture with impunity to weak*
en and to undermine this fair and solid founda-
tion of Republican prosperity.
We owe it to the bounty of Providence that the
mischievous desires of the heart are often counter-
acted by a strange confusion of the head, which
makes desperate politicians audacious without
art, and hypocritical without deceiving. Nature
has implanted a salutary instinct in the mind,
and a sense of eternal justice in the heart, which
enables every virtuous people to appreciate their
honest benefactors, and to protect them against the
crafty combinations of confederated foes; the schem-
ing avarice of party strife; and all the vile, re-
vengeful, maddening rage of disappointed ambition.
Gentlemen in the Opposition exaggerate the
distress of the times; and prognosticate a restora-
tion of national felicity under the hopeful reign of
General Harrison. They first overcharge their
picture of distres*; and then applaud ihe effica-
cious panacea of a National Bank, in makirg a
cure, and in raising and maintaining the prices of
our staple productions.
Sir, the future may be safely predicted from a
faithful history of the past. Daring the palmy days
of (hi Nation ! Bwk Own wis M much ftntn,]
distress, and as much fluctation in the prices of our
staple commodities as there has been since.
The average pnce of flour in Philadelphia, dar-
ing the four years of Mr. Adams's administration
was #5 Hi. During the eight years of General
Jackson's administration, it was #5 90. During
the four years of Mr. Van Buren's administration
it has not been less than #7.
In Niles's Register, under date of October 9th, 1819, we find
the following:
" Wheat —The Buffalo Journal of the 14th ultimo, say 
considerable quantities of wheat of the first quality were sold
duisng the past, week at thirty seven and a half cents tke
bushel, and the Gazette says, it did not meet a ready sale even
at that price "
Again- " There was a considerable sale of geod and whole-
some flour in Baltimore, a few days since, which after the cost
of transportation and other incidental expenses were paid,
yielded the owner only 81 25 cents the barrel "—Register.
March 17, 1821.
This was under the reign of the National Bank and during
the "era of good leelings" in Mr Monroe's administration But
one then had the folly to tell the farmers, that these low prices
were owing to the administration, nor could they be charged to
the want of a National Bank. But let us come ten years later—
take the year 1830, with a National Bank, and 1810 without a
National Bank. The prices in those years in the great Western
market for bread stuffs and provisions, Rochester, were as fol-
lows:
In April, 1830, with a National
Bank.
Wheat, 75 rents a bushel,
Flour, 84 25 the barrel,
Oats, 20 cents the bushel,
Corn, 35             do
Potatoes, 18       do
Beef, «2 50to*3cwt.
Pork, 84 p«r cwt.
I present, sir, a statement of prices, taken in part
from the Pennsylvaman, and in part from the
Globe, and which, I presume, is correct:
PRICES OF FLOUR,
For the first three months of the year, from 1796 to
1840, inclusive.
In February, 1840, without a
National Bank
Wheat, 88 rpnts a bushel,
Flour, 85 25 the barrel,
Oats, 31 cents the bushel,
Corn, 47             do
Potatoes, 20         do
Beef, $4 to 85 cwt.
Potk, 85 per cwt.
