HARRISBURG, PA., August 7, 1862.

Brigadier General C. P. BUCKINGHAM:

Your telegram does not seem to be intended as an answer to my communication of the 5th instant, which had probably not reached you when the dispatch was prepared. We are convinced that the only practicable method of effecting a fair draft in this State would be that indicated. The enrollments should be prepared and the draft made by U. S. officers.

A. L. RUSSELL,

Adjutant-General of Pennsylvania.

MADISON, WIS., August 7, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I am besieged with questions whether the draft will be so arranged that counties which have furnished their whole quota before the 15th will be exempt from draft, or how far will that be the case. It is important to be able to reply. Please answer. When shall we receive the regulations?

E. SALOMON,

Governor of Wisconsin.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, D. C., August 7, 1862.

His Excellency E. SALOMON,

Governor of Wisconsin, Madison:

The assignment of quota to counties is left to Governors of States. This Department only assigns the quotas of States. Regulations are now preparing for drafting. Let your enrollment be made as soon as possible. By order of the Secretary of War:

C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., August 8, 1862.
