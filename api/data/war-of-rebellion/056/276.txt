CHATTANOOGA, November 29, 1863. (Received December 2.)

Major-General HURLBUT,

Memphis, Tennessee:

I have directed all the organized force that can be spared from Springfield, Chicago, and Indianapolis to be ordered immediately to Columbus, Ky.

A force of some four regiments have been ordered from Eastport to Nashville by river. Orders have gone to commanding officer at Paducah, Ky., to turn them to Columbus also, if they have not already passed that place. When you get these re-enforcements make your own disposition of them.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

Just received following from Colonel Kendrick at Moscow:

A citizen living near the lines of this command came in this morning and reports that Richardson is between Holly Springs and Coldwater, and Forrest with a larger force is south of him, both moving northward. The man is reliable. Nothing further from Mizner.

By order of Colonel Geddes, commanding post, I sent a scout to Ripley last night, who reports that Forrest was expected there yesterday, but had not arrived. That Faulkner or Ferguson was at Rocky Ford collecting troops to join Forrest at Rippley. Will keep you advised.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
