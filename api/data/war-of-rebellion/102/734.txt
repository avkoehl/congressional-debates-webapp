FORT LEAVENWORTH, KANS., June 2, 1865.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Washington, D. C.:

The trip north of Platte River is very much delayed by the crossing of Loup Fork at Columbus and the Platte River at Kearny. If one of the pontoon bridges across the Tennessee in Department of Cumberland could be sent me, it would be taken out from Omaha and placed across these streams and be a great benefit to Government as well as the emigrants, and we could use it for several years. I think I could get it transported from Omaha free of cost to the Government. It could be sent from Nashville to Omaha by boat. The bridge I built at Decatur-French bateau-would be the best. Can it be had?
