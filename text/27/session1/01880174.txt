CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
To understand the merits of this case, and to judge oí the
propriety or impropriety of the course pursued by Mr Web
ster in it, we must have a clear and distinct understanding of
the facts Fer these, I refer you to the speech of the honora
bie chairman of the Waygana|Meansat the last session, to the
statement of the case made by Mr Webster himself, and lastly,
to a condensed and nervous statement of them m the other end
of the Capitol, which has never been denied or contradicted
there or on this floor
" This brings me to the case before us What is it? Uhe
facts of the case aieail spiead outin official documents, and the
evidence of them are Uear and undeniable An American
steam ferry boat traverses the Niagara river, she carries pas
sengers and property from one shore to the other The Eng
lish believe, and perhaps truly, that she carries men and arms
to the insurgents m Canada, and without any appeal 10 our
Governments, either State or Federal—without applying to us
to put our own lawsm foice against hei—an English officei,
of his own head, without the knowledge ol the British Go
vemment, determines to do—what? Not to watch the sus
pected vessel, ai rest her m the fact, seize the guilty and spare
the innocent, but to steal upon hei in the night, board her
asleep, and destroy her at the American shoie, undei the flag of
her country In the evening of the meditated outrage, volun
teers are called foi—fifty or sixty dashing, daring fellows—
ready to follow their leader to the devil, for that was the
language user!, and it proves the expedition to have been
a diabolical one, and worthy to be led as well as foi
lowed by demons The arms were sables and pit,
tols, the season of attack, midnight, the means of ap
proach, hghtboats and muffled oars, the progress, alow, silent,
and stealthy, that no suspicious sound should alarm the sleep

night—i each her without discovery—rush on boaid—fly to the
berths—cut, slash, stab, and shoot all whom they see— pmsue
the flying and besides those m the boat, kill one man at least
upon the soil of his country, fai from the watei's edge Victo
nous in an attack where theie was no resistance, the conqueioi*
draw the vessel into the midst of the euirent,--et heron fire, and
With all her contents—the dpad, the 1 wng, the wounded, and
the dying—send her m flames ovei the fngntful cataract of the
Niagara McLeod, the man whose íelease is demanded from
us, was (according tohis own dt-clatations, made at the timu m
his own country, íepeated since in ours <md accoidmg to the
sworn testimony of one of the survives) an auoi in thu pirati

and the admissions of his comrades, he was one of the foi em ist

Yankees," to use his awn words, with his own hands n—Mr
Benton's speech %n Senate United States
Now, su, on these facts, which it waims one's Ameuean
blood to recite, can this band of meicilts* deeper idoes belnble
to punishment under the laws of New \ork, whtietheu mints
were perpetrated1? To my mind after the best exumnaiion I
have been able to give to the subject, thcie can be but one ic
sponse McLeod, one of tht peipt-tntotp, is msweiable, unites
hecan show that it wasa. publn mihliiyexp dmon, setoti foot

In time of opt n public war, such authanty would he pie

and out of these would find immunity to the individuals en

Sir, the waves of Niagara have extinguished the fires of that
vessel—they have silenced forever the a^onmnp- shrieks of
her remamirg crew—but the cry for vengeance still comes up
from her deep and agitated bosom, in tones louder than the
thunder of her own mighty cataract    I carry you back to that
midnight scene—to the tramp of British soldiers—I point you
to the dead bodies of your countrymen—to the blazing victim of
the falls Contemplating all these tilings, m the stillness of that
mght, can your heart find one throb of approbation, to the cold
unfeeling diplomacy—to the tame and ready submission of the
American Secretary of State1
Submission to what? I answer—1st To the impudent me-
nace or threat of the Bntish Government Do you ask me what
he should have done? I answu that he should have stopped
all negotiation at once—instantly to have stopped it—until that
menace was withdrawn I answer further that the least he
should have done would have been, the moment the British Go
verumeiit avowed hei approbation of the act, he ought to have
retorted her own language of peremptory demand oftatibfao
tion, and to have flung back her own menace of the venom,
consequences of a refusal This, sir, is the least he should have
done, on that proud and insulting uccasion What else should
he have done"1 Answering at all, he should have said to Mi
Fox Your avowal of this act by the British Government is
vague, pi evarieating, and unsatisfactory
I ask your attention, and that of this House and nation, to the
precipe word  of that avowal
"The giounds on which the British Government make this
demand upon the Government of the United States are these
That the tiansaction on account of which Mr McLeod has been
ariested, and is to be put \.pon his uial, was a transaction of a
public chaiacter, planned and executed hy persons duly em
powered by her Majesty's Colonial authouties to take any steps,
and to do any acts, which might be nece^ai y foi the defet re of
her Majesty's tormenes, and for the piotectionofhei Maiesty's
subjects, and that, consequently, thost- subjects of hei Majesty
who engaged in tint tian«act on, weie reiforming an act of
public duty, for whit h they cannot be made personally and in
dividually answeuble to the laws and tribunals of any foieien
souwry "
Tht.se aie the precipe words of the British Minister It is fan
to piesume that they are the prtcise words of the oiders of Col
McNab, under whom McLeod was acting Well, sir, suppose
these oiders to be before us now, oí befóte the couits of JNew
\oikon the tual will such oideis co\ei the case of McLeod,
will they justify the 6*i/wi ^ of the Caroline, the invasion ofoui

thoiity They weie only authorized oí oideied todo tuchacts
as weie nec°ssaiy foi the "defence of her teintoiy, and the pro
tection of her Maiesty's subiects " Tin things done, and foi
which he stands indicted, weie foi none ol thest- purposes, and
they, there foi e, stand without excuse oi justification, because
they exceeded the ir luihonty When is it that mdittdwls

But, sir I repeat that nothing shoit of a pievious ordei to do
the specific act complained of, given by competent authouty,
can save McLeod in the count nf New York No subsequent
approval of it by the British Government can do it Mcleod
will find it so on histnal—and the Ameucanfeecretaiy of State

Ministry «aw the same thing—the Bntish Paihament saw it—
and 'heyaie all now waitina in full assurance that the heroes of
Acre will have no opportunity to increa-p their laurels on the
coast of Amenca
But, sir, they may be mistaken after all     There is but one
thing can save him on his trial Jf indeed he were absent fiom
the scene of these outrages—if indeed he was no member of
that "public force," he will and ought to be acquitted
But the Supreme Court will require him, as Mi Webster
ousht to have done, to produce the order under which the party
acted They will look closely to the extent of that order, and
if that ordei weie exceeded, he must die No subsequent appro-
val of the British Government can shield him—no oversight of
the American Secretary can set aside the strict and impartial ad
ministration of justice Oie he must, and all the thunder of the
Bntish navy cannot frighten the American people from approv
mg and applauding the sentence
If such should be the fate of McLeod, there remains but one
question to be considered, and that is one of peace and of war.
Will Great Britain feel bound and pledged to declare war
against this country to avenge his death? Sir, England would
never have thought of sucha thing, but for the u mid policy
and unwise admissions of the Secretary of State As it is,
she may and probably will venture to appeal to that "«tama
ratio regium," and, sir, in the very declaration in which she
appeals io arms, she will present the correspondence of our
own Secretary to vindicate the act She will spread it before
all Europe as her justification, and will engrave it on the very
banner under which she will march to the conflict
Mr Speakei, it lstoaveitthe horiois of war that this appa-
rent severity of lemaiks on the course of the hecieiary has
been indulged in, and, if it must come, we wish to rescue the
countiy fiom the imoutation of having induced it, by having
00 tamely sunendertdtbe rights of oui citizens
It is not too late yet ioi Mr Webster to review the fatal ad
missions he has made, and to place this couespondence on
moio elevated and moie defensible foundation If no exhortation
on this flooi can prevail with him, let him learn it fiom Lord
Palmerston himself Let him learn it in the leply of that no
bleman to LoidStauly in the British Parliament on the 9th of
February, 1841     On that occasion he stated
"Withregaid to the giound taken by Mr Forsyth, in reply
to Mi Fox, l think tt right to state that the American Govern-
ment undoubtedly might have censideied this tiansaction,
