HDQRS. ADVANCE GUARD, CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS,Pima Villages, May 6, 1862.

Lieutenant BEN. C. CUTLER,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, District of Southern California:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to report fair progress in obtaining forage for the animals now here, but as yet no prospect presents itself of my being able to accumulate a surplus for an onward movement or to meet the wants of any additional number of animals suddenly placed here. Immediate payment in manta may work a change, but until that fact is proved I must continue doubtful about daily supplies even. The crop of mesquite beans will matu5re in all this month, and some of the wheat; then the problem will be solved of the dependence that can be placed upon supplies here. I state these facts for the information of the colonel commanding, whose plans mayhinge upon them somewhat. No flour comes in, and I fear will not as long as we call for their wheat so freely. If, however, we can get enough wheat for forage, the flour can be brought up from Fort Yuma in lieu of it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Lieutenant-Colonel First Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding

Lieutenant BENJAMIN C. CUTLER,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, District of Southern California:

I have the honor to report the following express arrangements by Indians from here to Grinnel's: To leave weekly every Wednesday morning from here; to arrive at Grinnel's on Friday; to remain there until ordered back by the commanding officer, and to be fed during their stay at that post; to be paid forty yards of manta for each trip to Grinnel's and back. This will save much fatigued and labot to cavalry-men and horses. I believe it to be the most economical arrangement for the Government and that the dispatches will be carried safely.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
