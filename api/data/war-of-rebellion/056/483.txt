Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Kingston, Tennessee, December 24. 1863.

Major-General FOSTER:

GENERAL: I am able to advise you that I have the pontoon bridge about ready to place across the Tennessee River at this point, but inasmuch as between this and the last of January will be the time a heavy flood usually occurs in our river, I would suggest the propriety of not laying the bridge down until after the winter flood. At the same time, as soon as we are furnished with rope for cables, the bridge can be laid across on short notice in case of emergency.

I will be ready to commence the work on the three steam-boat hulls next week if the nails are furnished by that time.

I would inquire in reference to Lieutenant G. H. Clemens, who was ordered here on duty as quartermaster, and sent by me to Knoxville on the 19th instant on important business connected with this post, since which time I have heard nothing from and fear that some accident may have befallen him.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

R. K. BYRD,

Colonel, Commanding Post.
