HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI, OFFICE OF THE CHIEF SIGNAL OFFICER,New Orleans, La., November 18, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Mil. Div. of West Mississippi:

SIR: I have the honor to submit to your consideration a statement of the information received at this office this 18th day November, 1864, from the following sources, a report from Captain Andrew G. Fitz, Port Hudson, La., November 9; the statement of William C. Galloway, Vicksburg, Miss., November 8.

Refugees from Jackson, La., state that the troops in the vicinity of that place were ordered to move to Jackson, Miss., on the 8th instant. The only force remaining was about thirty men, under Lieutenants Brown and McGuire. Mr. Galloway, who was taken from Desha County, Ark., to Shreveport, La., about the middle of October, and returned to a point on the Mississippi River about thirty-five miles below Vicksburg, states that there are very few troops in the country through which he passed. He met Harrison's brigade, which he estimated at only 800. He thinks they have gone to Alexandria. He saw an escort taking men to work on the fortifications at Alexandria. He thinks there are about 3,000 men in Shreveport.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. M. JACKSON,

Second Lieutenant, Signal Corps, U. S. Army.

NEW ORLEANS, November 18, 1864.
