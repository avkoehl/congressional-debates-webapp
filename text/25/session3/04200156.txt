President's Annual Message—Mr.
Crary.
Ho. of Reps.
out a due consideration of the fact that lenders, as
well as borrowers, are necessary to the existenceof
such institutions They were established among
bonowers, and where only small amounts of cap-
ital could be used to advantage They shared the
fate that always awaits every premature a*'empt
to extend the division of labor Bat a failure
from such causes 13 not to be used as an argument
against a system of free banking, established on
a proper foundation Chartered associations have
failed from similar causes, and even State institu-
tions have been unable to redeem their promises
Our motto for the seas has been, " free trade and
sailors' rights," the improved modes of thinking
of modern times will soon cause it to be our motto
for the land When that time comes, the abuses
of banking will be coirected, us monopolizing
character destroyed, and Us anti íepubhcan tend
ency abated Capital will find its own level,
and labor us owft sure rewaid
But, sir, let us return once more to the con-
sideration of the " anti republican tendencies of
associated wealth " In wl at State of the Union
have they not been manifested' Look at the
action of this associated wealth in suspending
specie payments without authority of law The
mandates of Bonaparte were never more imperious
than were our banking institutions on that occa-
sion They said to trade, perish ' and it perished
without a murmur They said to eoraraei ce, die '
and it died without a struggle Your merchants
shut up their shops, and your ships weie laid up
at the wharves With millions of specie in their
vaults, these institutions put the community at
defiance, and, in many instances, dictated to the
sovereign power the conditions of peace They
entered the arena of politics, called conventions,
deliberated on the condition of the countiy, regu-
lated the laws of trade, and attempted to prescribe
the course of action in this body The moneyed
lung issued his proclamation, condemned the
Treasury circular, impeached the conduct of the
Secretary of the Treasury in the distribution of
the surplus revenue, attacked the message of the
President at the extra session, and commanded
ins liege subjects to retreat behind their "cotton
bags '' We have "seen them, at a late election in
one of the largest States of the Union, uniting to
overthrow a paity in power fn the purpose of
perpetuating the íeign of shinplasters, and of en
abling their fuends, on gaining the victoiy, to
inscribe on their banneis, " No sub treasuiera for I
the Empire State "
But the anti republican tendency of associated
wealth is not confined to our own countiy The
first English association for tiading with the Vast
Indies originated with a capital ot about $150,000
This capital has been augmented fiom time to
time until it now amounts to almost $30,000,000
The association com menced as a trading company,
fc ut the cupidity of the counting house was soon
t nited with the honor of the sokhet, the meichant
fcecame a conrjueror, the trader a king TUiey
have despoiled one of the fnuest poiuons of the
globe, have waged relentless wais for plunder,
mindeied millions for their gol J, and devastated
a continent for the sake of power lheie is no
act of cruelty, injustice, fraud, lapine, tyianny,
and baseness which does not stain the history of
the career of this association Venly, associated
wealth has an anti republican tendency It not
only uses its power to control the laws of trade
and the politics of State, but to govern the desti
mes of nations Such a power should be watched
by the friends of Democratic institutions with
never ceasing vigilance It is concentral mg itself
for a fearful struggle, and on the issue will depend
the question whether the few, a class, are to pie-
dommate, or whether the many, the people, shall
rule I have no fears of the final íesult The
people wjll come off more than conquerors
The gentleman from Tennessee denies the in
fluenee of the mass of the people in the conduct
of our national affa rs He says '< never before
' were the miss oT the community so pov erless
' I hey have nothing to do but to follow blindly,
' and jive their sam tion to schemes and meisures
•  die ate J by the heads of the party, some thiee or
*  fiur men it most "   1 his may be a coriect íep
it   entatirn of the condition of the Opposition, but
it is not tiue whe i applied to the mass of the com-
munity     Iheir powei was never greater than at
the present moment They never before enjoyed
greater political franchises The influence of the
Democratic principle in the States has gradually
removed the property requisitions for office, ex-
tended the right of suffrage, and created a more
immediate responsibility to the people of those
holding public trusts When the Constitution
was formed,j3residential electors were chosen
with the expectation that they would exercise
their judgments in selecting a Chief Magistrate,
but they now deposit their votes as the agents of
the popular will, and for the man designated by
the majonty By degrees the people have as-
sumed the right to choose nearly all of those offi-
cers whose duties intimately affect their interest
The time has not long gone by since they were
I denied the light of expressing their opinion on
' public affairs, for the purpose of influencing the
j deliberations of this body Now, they instruct
us, and sometimes their instructions are obeyed
iTheie is a powerful party in the country who
j believe in the right of instruction, and those who
' oppose this right are willing to listen to addresses
I and resolutions upon matters deeply affecting the
public interests Even the opponents of the
"fieice Democracy" are beginning to study a
little 111 the school of popular rights
I Mi Chairman, the time has gone by when
" three or four men at most," howevei popular,
can dictate the public policy of this countiy No
man i« powerful now who is not the exponent of
the public opinion of the masses The want of a
knowledge of this fact, or of a due appreciation of
Us truth, has been the cause of all the blunders
committed by the gentleman and his friends
They have attempted to dictate to the masses
They have set up their own gods, and called on
all Israel to worship them, and against those who
would not bow down and ciy out, "these be our
gods also," they have uttered an anathema mata-
nalha They have denounced them as outcasts,
levelers, agrarians, woikies, and Locofocos All
of these epithets have been applied to the masses,
who could not believe in the infallibility of the
opinions of certain great men m this countiy
The people acknowledge no leaders, unless they
are the lepresentatives of their opinions Ihey
have no dictators but the principles of tiuth
Ihese they embiace, comprehend, and sooner or
later enforce
The Democratic party here have been clmged
with receiving their instructions fiom " the White
House" This declaration needs pioof 1 know
of no one of their number whose conduct should
subject him to this imputation Instiuctions come
to us fiom a (liflerent quarter, from ihe distilas
that we represent Even the Piesident som( limes
takes lessons in these normal schools He did so
on the great question of a separatu n of bank and
State On that occisión he put himself at the
head of a gieat and powü fu! p°rty, which de-
manded that measure It showed itself heie in
the Ion.; rissioii of 1836 but its strength wis
more manifest m places far removed from the
conupting 11 ftuences of the Capitol I stand iif on
this llooras the repiesentative of that principle
It wis put at issue in my own State, before the
President sent forth his messige at tht extia ses
sion, and it was nobly sustained at the ' allot
boxes We had no dictation fiom the White
House, and none fiom those high in authority
The movement was voluntary on the part of the
people, and was crowned with success
The mass of the community are far from being
powerless, and he who asserts it has entirely
mistaken the signs of the times They make and
unmake us all Whom they will they set up, and
whom they will they put down 1 he man who
assumes to be their dictator soon sees " the fingers
upon the plastei of the wall "and fiom that hour
his power departs from him and he becomes a
political outcast In this particulai the lite Pies
ldent has been grossly libeled He was neither
a dictator noi a tyrant I do not deny his power,
but it was power acquit el by his ssgacitv to (lis
cern the feelings and wishes of the people If he
hod attemp'cd the pan of a d etntor 01 a lyrait,
not all the hopoiu rcq med at ¡New Oileans, not
all the glories of a Ion" a j dis'ineuivhed li'e of
m litary seivice, could have «a ed him fiom pi lit
luil annihilation Oreneral Tpckson was thecham-
pion of the rights of mankind in the aggregate
against certain classes who would have all to them-
selves He was the chosen representative of those
who were in favor of circumscribing the action
of this Government, of bringing back the Constitu-
tion to what it was intended to be by its framers,
of preserving the sovereignty and independency of
the States, and with them, the rights of the people
He brought around him men fresh from the ranks
^of the people, acquainted with then wants, and
understanding the current of their opinions He
consulted those men, and foi that cause alone his
opponents charged him with being under the in-
fluence of a " Kitchen Caoinet " It was a Cabi-
net worthy oí the man It enabled his master
mind to go on with the age, and keep up with the
advancing spirit of the countiy
Mr Chairman, the gentleman from Tennessee
says, "that new party names have been invented;
that we of late hear of little else than the Democ-
racy of the country " That man is little versed
in the history of our politics who does not know
that the word Democrat has been a party cog-
nomen for almost half a century It was once
used as a term of reproach for the purpose of
bunging into disrepute the hbeial views of such
men as Jefferson and Madison It was given as
a paity name as early as 1794, and has since been
so much honored ihatoui opponents seem disposed
to take it fiom us In denying to us our ancient
appellation, it was, doubiless, the intention of the
gentleman to pi epare for this grand larceny The
I'ederahots, once National Republicans, the Whigs
of 1834, and the Republican Whigs of 1838, are
about to assume the name of Democratic Whigs
New party names have indeed been invented, but
not by us, sir We stand by the old landmarks,
we rally under the old banners—the banners that
have so often led to victory and to glory
I said that the word Democrat was once applied
to our party asaterm of repioach In 1797, Trum-
bull, the poet and Tedeiahst, but an honest man
withal, applied the word Democrat to our party
in a poem published in the Connecticut Couiant

The United State0Gazettesa d " It is very cer-
'tain that the leading Dcmocrats in the United
' States are almost to a man Deists and Athe-
' ists " 1 he=e extra ts, horn Federal papers,
show ihat theie was then a turbulent paity in the
country called Demon at*, and that the great body
of them weie considered as only fit to weed com,

In fuithei pioof that we are still rallying under
the old bsnners, let us have the woids of the Au-
tora—a Democtatic paper
In 1796 thi^parersays " Dr Rush'seulogium
' on  Itittenhouse has ^iven great offense to the
I  Ansociats, because he was the president of a
' DlMOCI  AT1C  SOCIETY   "
On the succeeding day, the same paper holds the
following language "It is a little remarkable thit
' the two great fires which have lately happened,
' haveappeared in two places that send Democratic
' RcruBiiCANs to Congress " Here, sir, is the
appellation of our party at full length, and yet we
are gravely told that " Democracy "is a new name
—an invention or modem times to gull the people
But, s 1, there is still another charge against
♦he peiolc It is " most emphatically denied that
we aie autho iz"d to boast of tneu increased at-
tacnment to our institutions " This is but the
lenetit on of the language of by gone days In
1791  a writer m the Coljmbia Se"tmel, tne lead-
II  ¿ Fedei il print in iNew EnglanJ, charged the
Demouats ' with exerting opposition to the ¡aw,
