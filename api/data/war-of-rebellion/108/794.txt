General R. E. LEE:

Reported advance of Averell turns out to have been a raiding party of seventy-five men, who crossed from Hardy and burned Columbia Furnace and retreated down the Valley. I have three companies in pursuit.

General EWELL:

GENERAL: I send both of Imboden's telegrams to General Lee. I presume the inclosed to you, from the general, was sent after he had received the first and before he had received the second, stating that the reported advance was but a raiding party, &amp;c. Copies of both of Imboden's dispatches were sent to General Stuart. Respectfully,

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

STAUNTON, VA., December 13, 1863-12 midnight.

General R. E. LEE:

Have been skirmishing with Averell's advance for two hours at McDowell. Don't expect general attack till to-morrow. Hope confidently to defeat him at this pass, but apprehend he will move toward Warm Springs, and force me to fall back toward Buffalo Gap or Goshen.

J. D. IMBODEN.
