THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 10,
head of this bureau, that it will be dangerous
to attempt to amend it in any other way than
by a motion to strike it out altogether. The
proposition not only to increase the number
of officers, but to increase all of these salaries
to a rate higher than is paid to any other offi-
cers of the Government of a like character,
is. it. seems to me, an insult to the intelligence
of this House and the country, and I hope that
the section will at once be stricken out without
besitaiion on the part of the members of this
House.
Mr. DAWES. Mr. Speaker, I hope the
House will not pass lightly over this matter
of increase of salaries and increase of offices.
Here is a proposition to create a new bux'eau
in the Treasuty Department,and the first thing
is to give the head of this bureau a larger sal-
ary than any head of bureau has at the present
time, and the salaries of all of his subordinates
are to be increased also. It is perfectly appar-
ent, if you do this, you must go into the general
business of increasing salaries. No man can
stand up here when the other heads of bureaus
come in, as they do annually, with their annual
solicitations to this House for increase of their
salaries, if you now create a new bureau, and
put the salaries of its officers at a higher rate
than any officers are now paid in the Treasury
Department. I have no doubt some of those
officers ought to have their salaries increased,
while others I do not believe ought to be in-
creased at all.
Ever since I have been here, or for many
years, I have tried to get the heads of these
Departments to take hold of the subject them-
selves. If there be anybody who should know
the different auties and responsibilities of the
different heads of bureaus, it ought to be the
heads of Departments ; but up to this time no
head of Department, no Cabinet officer who
has these bureaus under him, has undertaken
any intelligent or general system of arranging
the duties, salaries, or compensation of the
officers under him. For twenty-five or thirty
years they have gone on in the wav our fathers
went, adding to the force but making no other
change. Men have come before the Commit-
tee on Appropriations, and other committees,
asking for an increase of their force, and when
ques.ions were put to them, " Does not your
experience in that office suggest something by
way of improvement in reorganization, or in
some other way that will add to its efficiency
wit.hout increasing the force?'' they have been
compered to fay there ought to be some reform
in tli.it direction. What do we do now? We
a-id to ihe many bureaus in the Treasury
Department by this bill, against which I say
nothing; and the committee bring in a bill
prepared outs de. as has been stated very prob-
ably by the committee, fixing a scale o I compen-
sation liiulier than that paid to anyo'her officer
i.i the Treasury Department for like services.
1 hope, therefore, the House wili scrutinize
this matter at the threshold, and so act on this
bill and these salaries as to meet the issue
hereafter, as we will be compelled to do, and
not, put up the salaries in this new bureau at
such a high figure as to produce discontent at,
the injustice done to the heads of bureaus in
e>very other Department. And, sir, this doing
it in this way is fnr.tfni of evil iu every respect
and of demoralization in eve.'y Department.
Now, therefore, that we talk so much about
reform in the civil service, let our attention
be arrested to this question of salaries in this
new bill. And with that view I rose simply to
move that, in view of the lateness of the hour,
the House adjourn, and that we take up this
question of salaries fresh on the morrow, so
that w? may apply to it oar serious attention and
adopt no scale that will be in the way hereafter.
The question being put on the motion of
Mr, Dawes, that the House do now adjourn,
it was agieed to; and accordingly (at three
o'clock and forty-five minutes p. m.) the House
adjourned.
