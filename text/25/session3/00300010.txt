THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 5,
It is proper to ascertain, m the next place, how
much of this balance is not immediately avail-
able and applicable to public purposes
The sum of #28,101,644 97, which has been
placed with the States for safe-keeping, is a pait
of that balance, and cannot, by the provisions of
the act oí Ouober 14,1837, be made available till
directed by Congress
Another part is about one million one hundred
thousand dollars, due chiefly from vauous in-
solvent banks, on account of the money that,
before 1837, had been placed in their custody to
the credit of the Treasurer, and still íemains un-
paid
Another portion is near two million four hun
dred thousand dollars, which is due from banks
that suspended specie payments m 1837, and will
probably not be paid during the present year
About five hundred thousand dollars of the
amount which has been placed m the Mint, foi
the specific puiposes designated in the laws on
that subject, is another part of that balance, which
could not at once be made available foi other ob-
jects without much public inconvenience
The aggregate of these items, not immediately
available and applicable to public puiposes, is
$32,101,644 97, and if deducted fiom the fore-
going balance, it would leave, on the 1st of Jan-
uary next, as stated in the commencement of this
report, only the sum of $2,765,342 36 then avail-
able, and applicable to those puiposes
Subjoined is a condensed view of the receipts
and means, as well as theexpendituies, for 1838,
as asceitained and estimated, also, the funds not
available m that year

For further particulais see the details of the
annual estimates
It will be perceived by these statements, that
no surplus balance will probably exist either on
the 1st of January, 1839, or during that year, to
be deposited with the several States for safe-keep-
ing, as a fourth installment under the deposit act
of June 23, 1836 Indeed great care will be ne-
cessary in lestncting the appiopnations to the
necessary wants of the Government, or the re-
ceipts will not be sufficient to meet the cunent
demands on the Treasury, unless those receipts
should unexpectedly exceed the present estimates
When an unusual excess existed in the Treas
ury, it was proposed to place that fourth install-
ment witih the States for safe-keeping till needed,
but befoie it became payable, the money was
wanted to discharge existing appropriations The
deposit ot it was therefore postponed by Congress
till next January, and the money has been used
by the United States, to which it belonged, with-
out inclining the expense and inconvenience, to
all the parties concerned, of paying and then im-
mediately recalling it That installment is not a
debt due to the States, and, hence, is not required
to be paid like an appropriation for the public
service Yet the remark may propeily be added,
that if a surplus should heieaftei accrue, large
enough, after defiaymg all the existing charges
imposed by Congress upon the Treasury, to make
the deposit originally contemplated, this, Depait-
ment, with its present views, would feel bound
to carry it into effect, unless Congress, in the
mean time, should further modify the laws now
in force in relation to the subject
V —EXPORTS AND IMPORTS IN 1838
The exports during the year ending September
30,1838, are computed to have been $103 136,000
Of these, about $90,666,000 weie of domestic,
and $12,470,000 of foi cign origin
The former having diminished fiom the previ-
ous year, $4,898,414, and the latter, $9,384,962
The impoits for the same year amounted to
$112,000,000
These a-c $28,989,217 less in value than those
of the previous yeai, being nearly $78,000,000
less than those undei the enormous oveit ading
and other oveiactions which characterized 1836
Foi furthei particulais reference may be had
to the table annexed
It is an interesting fact that dunng the last
thiee years m0re than $86,000 000 annually, or
an average of neaily nine tenths of om whole
domestic exports, have been derived from agn-
cultuie More than seven tenths of oui whole
population aie probably employed in that useful
pursuit
VI —EXPLANATION    or   TUT    ESTIMATES    OF    RE
CEIPTS   AND  EXPENDITURES,  AND    SUGGESTIONS
ON   IHF   MODE   OF   MEETING   FLUCTLATIONs   IN
THEM
The receipts from customs during the present
year will vaiy but little fiom the estimates sub
mitted in the last annual report The receipts
fiom lands will be less, but the amount of sales
made, and preemption rights existing, will not
differ essentially from what was anticipated,
though the act of Congress, as to the Htter,
passed so late that payments lor all of them could
not be íeahzed till another yeai, without causing
much inconvenience and unnecessaiy pressuie in
some portions of the country
The estimates piesented foi newappropnations
and foi expenditures, in 1838, were quite as large
as the views of the different Depertments, at the
time Congress assembled m December last, ap-
peared to justify, but the unexpected continuance
of the Flonda wai, a solicitude to induce the
Cherokees to remove peaceably, and an earnest
i desire to suppi ess with promptitude ail threatened
