APPENDIX TO TAB CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July, 1841.
27"th Cong......1st Sess.
Loan Bill—Mr. McKeon.
H. of Reps
and to what? I have heard him this momtng pe-
remptorily deny that he ever said that there were
#40,000,000 of debt on the Government He
never did state this positively. I hold m my hand
his speech of last year, and an elaborate speech it
will be found, prepared with great care, not only as
to its figures, but aloo as to us mode of expression
I am aware it speaks of probabilities and enmates,
and deals in cautious and guarded expressions. I
will refer to portions of it, and appeal not only to
the House, but to the candor of the gentleman
himself, to answer me whether or not the impres-
sion was not fairly deducible from these expres-
sions, that a debt of $40,000,000 must be met by
the present Administration? These are the ex-
tracts:
Mr Chairman, I have one statement more to present, and
then I shall have done with inv notice of the remarkable posi
tion that this Government has 'relieved itself entirely from
debt" My object in this statement is to make as near an ap
proach as I can to the sum of all the burdens ajid charges
which will, or may probably, fall on the Treasury In the four
years of the in coming Administration, over and above all ordi
nary and current expenditures The items m this st uement
will be sufficiently understood, after the explanations which I
hare already given

Here is arranged a long line of items, striking
the public eye, all summed up in the enormous
amount oí upwards ot forty millions Tne
gentleman may not have been it, but I assure him
that in public newspapers in our own Slate ilns
very table has. been circulated, ami with but one
object, to impress the public mmd with the idea of
the load of debt saddled by the late Administration
on the present? Now, sir, my colleague may say
tnat the most of his statement was all mere cm-
j'ctwre. Tha* will not answei. He and his
tnends have the power to borrow as much mo-
ney as they can it ihey will probably be re-
quired to provi Je means, why not provide sufficient
at thus time, aud put it all into this bill? I ask ray
colleague, now he has the power, which of this
long list of items we will probably not be called upon
to pay, which he now eilimates this Administration
will not be called upon to discharge' Certainly he
does not expect to be discharged from the Hem of
nine millions of the fourth instalment His politi-
cal friends in our Stale expresily insist on that ¡tern.
He must add that to Ihe present proposed loan He
will not take out the five millions lor the Frenen spo
liations. My friend at the headof the Committee on
Foreign Affairs, [Mr Coshing,] who has for yeirs
been the champion of these claims, will not as-
sent to this item not being considered atnonguthe
estimates. I willnotgn 'brough the list,but will ask
my colleague to tell this committee what now are our
probable and esitmaferf liabilities, and which of these
items must be provided for' Sir, he will not move
to increase this bill. He will not, I am satisfied,
propose to increase the amount of this loan bill
He may now say he was misunderstood II wa^ by
such misunderstanding the late political revolution
was produced. It was sounded throughout the
country that an immense public debt had been in-
curred in time of peace, that burdens were laid up-
on the people, and their substance squandered
One universal shout was heard on all sides pro-
claiming this fact, and now, when the excitement is
over, and we ask gentlemen to defend their state-
ments, they tell us ihey have been misrepresented
or misunderstood Yes, sir, I again repeat it, that
on such misunderstandings w« have been tried —
most unfairly tried—before the American people
Wronged as (he late Administration was ia this
particular, I am willing that ihe pa^t should be
a closed book The 4th, if not the ides of March,
has come and gone You told the country that
then new books would be opened—new policy pur-
sued To the gentleman from Massachusetts I say
the word is "onward." You cannot turn th  eyes
of ihe country back, thev are bent on an onward
course—and such a course as jou now ar  holding
forth to tbem' You promt ed them relief. Where
is it to be found' In (his extraordinary session
of Congress which thus far pro">oses relief
by squandering the public domain while you
are in distress, and Ia\ing the foundation
of a public deter? The leaders of the pre-
sent Admimsiration make Charles Surface the
great exemplar of their financial conduct When
he found himself in. difficulty as to money matters,
he called in the auctioneer—put up the family pic-
tures, and by these means raised money. His
first act was to give the money to a fnend in
distress, exactly in the same way as you
give Ihe proceeds of the public lands to the
Slates m distress When appealed to on the score
of the propriety of paying his debts, of being just
before he was generous, he objected, on the ground
that Jusiice was  o lame a jade she never could
keep pace with Generosity Will the people sanc-
tion such generosity? a senerostt y wMch is calcu-
lated to corrupt the States, and to prostrate the
great mas, at the feet of a moneyed power? I knpw
this is considered by many on thi* floor as address-
ed to the prejudices of Ihe great body of Ibepeoplp
Nol st It is lo Iheir ralm, del berate judgment I
appral, on the measures you are now forcing on the
rountry—I repeat, forcing on th  rruniry—at Ihis
session, under the burning heat of the summer sol-
stice, wi'h an imperfect Congress, ind an unfair
representation on this floor You are building up,
<n detaclied portions, a most alarming system,
which ¿s we/I calculated to rally around tlas central
Government the wealth uf this country and of Eu-
rope, and lo wield the power of ihis Government to
the aggrandizement of the few, at the sacrifice of
ihe interests of the many
Already we have had ev detice of the effrontery
of foreign bankers m calhn  upon the General Go-
vernment Who would have believed that (he
Rothschilds and oiher banker  would be send -
mg letters rogatory to our President? It is
manifest that the operations of this Govern-
ment are now to be exerted to promote the mo-
neyed interests of the nation With intense
anxiety I have watched each movement at the pre
sent s ssion Every step tends to concentrate
around the General Government the capital o* the
country, and the day may not be far dis'ant when
it will be found with immense weight pressing on
th  labor of the nation The siAipl city of our
Government is vamshirg, and each diy brings us
nr-arer the proceeding-, of the dynasties of Europe
They are continually in negotiations with bankers
We are no v commencing negotiations But this
morning we find on our tab'es evidence that the great
money kings of the age have crossed the Atlantic
and are now asking the interference of th« General
Government on behalf of the State debt* It ap-
pears that it is not sufficient that we should dis
charge our own obligations, but we are asked to
relieve the several States I hold in my hind a
document which gives certain letters addressed by
foreign banking-houses to the President of the
united States and ihe Secretary of State. I ask
the attention of the committee to these extraordi-
nary papers, most proper documents for this extra-
ordinary session The first is a leUer bearing date
London, April 2,1841 from N. M Rothschild and
Sons to the late President of the United States
!l (General Harrison ) The letter states that ihey
had addressed him on the 9th of March That
communication was not referred to the Department
of State, and of this we know nothing Ihe
Rothschilds state that they are apprehensive that
the State of Indiana will not be able to pay the
semi-annual interest due on the first of July. The
letter then proceeds to say, that
"The high sense expressed in your inaugural address of the
importance of the various States of the Union maintaining
their credit by the fulfilment of their engagements, and the en
lightened views expiessed in regard to the intimate connection
of their proceedings with the honor of the Republic, have pro
duced much general satisfaction and approbation, and although
awaie how much the great concerns you have to direct must
engross your attention, we are emboldened by those favorable
sentiments to bring to > our notice the circumstance of the de
firiency in the means of the State of Indiana for the payment
of her next dividend / word from you, or the least mterpo
sition m her favor, could nol fail to afford relief in the
present exigency, and it appears to us that in order to be ef
fective, some measure should be adopted with as little delay as
possible A large portion ot the stock, amounting to e3,b00,
000, has had the interest and puncipal made payable with our
house, and tt would be desirable for us to be prepared, by the
1st June, with the necesaaiy fundsfor the payment of the next
dividend
"We hope you will consider the subject of the present letter
to be of sufficient importance to have your attention, as we are
assuied you would not fail to bestow it upon any point you
deemed to be connected with the interests ol the great Repub
lie you preside over and we trust the importance we attach to
it will form eur excuse with you for entering fully into the ex
planation ot our opinions
'We beg leave to present to you the assurance of our high
esteem and respect and we have the honor lo remain, sir, your
obedient and humble servants,

The Messrs Roihchtlds were net satisfied with
addressing the Piesident On the 7th April, 1841,
tn y issued another ukase, addressed to theSecreiary
of State Tnat letter, after referring to the eooimt-
mcation addressed to the President, and it timating
that Indiana must not allow her interest to re nain
unpaid, states as follows
"If the non payment of the said dividend were permitted to
take place, the consequences woul 1 be extremely prejudicial to
the financial and commercial credit of America, as it would be
an unprecented instance of one of the States of the Union failing
in the fulfilment of her engagement to her creditors, and we con
sider it of so much importance that anoccunence of this nature
«hould be avoided that weare induced to recommend it to the
attention of the Federal Government We hope that m
doing so an 1 in pointing out also the impoitance of all the
M ites continuing to observe with their usual punctuality the
fulfilment of then engagements we shall not be considered
presuming, ab our motive is to sustain the credit which the
estates havehitheito enjoyed in the European markets, and
which has faoilicitated the negotiation therein of numerous and
extensive loans for promoting the general improvement of the
country
Ihe position of the State of Indiana comes moiopaitiularly
under our cognizance as a large poition ol hei stocks, amount
ing to 43 600 000, is made payable with our house, and it would
be des rabie for the necessary lunds to be in oui hands by the
1st tune We beg leave therefore to lepresent to you that any
interposition in her behalf would require tobe prompt,mor
del to be effectual

turn to the Hague At that pUce we have as our

man of my colleague, [Mr. Barnard] While
the latter is figuring up the debt of ihe National
Government in this country, Mr. Bleecker is call-
ed upon to provide means to discharge the debts,
Messrs Hope and Co of Amsterdam, under date
of May 11, 1841, addressed a letter to Mr.
Bieecker     The Hope letter is as follows
Amsterdam, May 11,1841
Sir We hope you will kindly excuse our troubling you with
the enclosed letter* one for the Governor of the Territory of
florida,  and the cthei  lor the Piesident of the Legislative
Council Vvhichyou will oblige us byfoiwardmg and we add
cop es of these /etters for your infoimation, begging you will
oblige us by sen ding the same to the General Government of
the Union, that  being the natural guardian of the Territory
and it would be of the utmost importance to the Dutch credi'
toib if you would consent to urge upon the «aid Government
the necebiity of watching over the affairs of Floilda, and pro
tecting the credit of the infant State
In a few davs we shall again have to trouble you with a
similai application to the Governor of the fetate of Mississippi
the mterebt coup ins due the 1st of May on the bonds of ihat
State having been left unpaid audit is a matter of much im
portanceto American credit in Holland that such instances of
inrgulaiity be promptly remedied
It i  thib view of the subject which induces us to hope that
m your official capacity you will kindly countenance our an'
\ ficationn
We have the honor to be sir,
Your most obedient servant"

sures, were transmuted by Mr. Bleecker to  Mr.
