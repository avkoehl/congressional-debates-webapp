CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,

June 2, 1864-2.30 p. m.

No attack will be made to-night under the orders previously issued. Unless the enemy attack us, the time will be devoted to rest. Meanwhile commanders should have their lines in a defensible condition and sufficiently closed to the enemy. Division commanders will examine the ground well and have the proper points of attack selected. It is very probable that an assault will be ordered at the earliest hour to-morrow. This will be regarded as confidential among the division commanders.

By command of Major-General Hancock:

FRANCIS A. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
