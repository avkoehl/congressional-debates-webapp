The expenses entailed upon the country in con-
sequence of the Mexican war and its acquisitions,
can be understood only by a relative comparison
of what were the expenditures of this Government j
before and after the war. Accurate tables have '
been prepared—the curious in such matters will j
find them in the Treasury Report of 1850—show-
ing, (see statement 1):

The Secretary of the Treasury, in his report of
1850, estimates, on most excellent data, the ex-
penditures and liabilities chargeable directly to
the Mexican war and the acquisitions consequent j
upon the treaty of peace, to be $217,175,577. The j

This Administration has had to meet such ob- !

its chief duties has been to pay the debts of its !

UEBENTrRCS, DRAWBACKS, XO EXPENDITURES. !
To understand the comparative expenditures of j
this Go\eminent, it will be necessary to bear in
mind the change* that the laws have made in the
mode of registering the expenditures from year to ,
year. Prior to June 30, 1849, the expenses of,
collecting the revenue from customs, lands, de-
benture bonds, refunding duties, &c., were never '
regKteted in the annual expenditures, but the cost
of colkvtmg the revenue alone for the first time,
of Kte registered as a part of the expenses of Gov-
ernment, is over two millions a year; and these
two millions appear now, under this Administra-
tion, as a pai t of the annual expenditures. The
same remark may be made of other items, that go ■
to swell up the $48,005,878, which the Register of
the Treasury reports as making the annual expen-
ditures for the year ending June 30, 3851. The
new system is, and it is a wise system, to record
all expenditures, all out-goings, "such as the fol-
lowing, and Whigs see it done with pleasure:
Repayment of duties on sugar and inoiasa.es, illegally ex-
acted by collcctors  $439,588

1 lions in the Treasury?" It is a fair question,
and I will not shirk it, I will meet it fare to face.
There was a time when it would have appalled
me, bat only because 1 was ignorant of the his-
tory, the wiuten,and unwritten history of I he tariff
of 1846. It may well have appalled a Whig 10
know why it was, when such sound men as George
: Evans and others predicted in the Senate and in
this House, that the tariff of 1846 would not yield
enough to carry oil the Government, that it should
. i' iedlly y!eld enough, and more too/ I propose to
'2,623 j solve this apparent contradiction of prophecy and
experience; and to the solution I beg the careful
attention of the House.
When George Evans and others, in 1846, made
preceding, were $48,005,878, being over estimates
for year ending 1852, £14,338,389.
COST OF MEXICAN ACQUISITIONS.
The Secretary of the Treasury states, in part,
of the appropriations required by'our new Territo-
ries, and in the fulfillment of our obligations con-
sequent upon the acquisition, the following items:

These are all items that have not hitherto figured i these predictions, they were based upon the tariff
m the annual expenditures of the Government, !, bill of July 30, 1846; which cut up all importations
and these amount in all to §8,309,331. Indeed the into schedules, from letter " A to letter I," and
estimates of the Secretary of the Treasury for the i| then affixed to them horizontal, universal ad valo-

ated by the last Congress, and the Congresses l! other nation under the sun, civilized or savage,
had ever been thus before, to say the least, so
original. Procrustes struck out the idea of a bed,
upon which short men were to be stretched out to
fit it, and long men to be chopped off to fit it; but
a universal ad valorem tariff bed was something
altogether new m political economy. So many
cents duty on a gallon of biandy or wine, was a
anu , duty, a specific duty, everybody could com pi e-

4'Sl,Wo 00 |i sucil were rated abroad, below what they
^ weie worth. What appraisers, they asked, too,
j can tell what wine is worth, (ad valorem,) uu-
, less they have been experienced, piacticed wine-
bibbers from their youth up? Even they, too,
1 might he deceived, for when liquors come over
Ij sea, especially high-priced wines, they often come,
! as it is termed technically, " sick;5>that is, muddy
j and roiled; apparently of an ad valorem not quarter
; price. Universal geniuses, they said, were wanted
! under such universal ad valorems for appraisers—
I the universal genius that can turn from arrack, or
j kirchenwasser to ginger roots and gelatine, or from
bananas to beeswax, wall an instant, thorough com-
j prehension of e\erytlnng. Their great objection,
j however, and their apprehensions came from the
serious radical defects? in the principle of an uni-
| versa! ad valorem system, and from the numerous
, frauds that must constantly be arising, and the con-
! slant conflicts the Treasury must always be in with
| merchants, American and foreign. Their leading
, objection was, that it based the American tariff upon
, European ad valorems—that is, made our Ameri-
! can tariff in Europe, and that when it thus surren-
; dered American to European interests, there waa
| no fixed system, no proper rule, no real law pre-
■ scribed for estimating these values even in Europe.
■ It is obvious that an American tariff, which surreji-
' ders the whole American system of home valna-
; tions to foreign valuations, is a foreign tariff,
! levied at American pons. If the value of cottons,
or woolens, or iron-wrought articles, is fixed in
' Europe, and upon that value, thus fixed there, a
! duty is levied and collected m New York, two
I things are obvious—first, that such a tariff is a
1 foreign levied tantf, even though collected under
1 American law; and, second, that the value, the ad
valorem, depends upon foreign estimation, foreign
! raprice, or, it may be, foreign fraud or peijury.
; The tariff law of July, 1846, was open to all these
objections, and 1 shall show,on Democratic,anti-
1 tariff authority, too, has been admitted so to be.
The force of these objections struck" Mr. Secre-
tary Walker and the Committee of Ways and
Means, in 1S46, and they did not believe that as
the tariff stood then, under the act of July, with
the whole ad valorem system then subject to for-
eign caprice, that they could collect duty enough
under it to carry on the Government. I make
these remarks, and draw these inferences, because
in ihot very extraordinary place for making tariffs,
the civil and diplomatic bill, approved August 10>
These are all expenditures falling upon the Ad-
ministration, unknown to preceding ones, and in
consequence of our Mexican acquisitions !
Now, neaily all the army of the United States
is in Texas, or in our Mexican acquisitions, and
much of our navy is employed on the Pacific coast,
where the cost of everything is enormous, in conse-
quence of the abundance of gold. Land surveys are
to be begun, land titles to be settled, revenue cut-
ters to be kept up, in short, a new and great country
there is to be colonized, and provided for, with
coast surveys, lights, fortifications, docks, mail-
ships, and harbor improvements; and where
there exists now littie or nothing, everything is to
be brought up to an equality with the old States.
There is no calculating for future expenditures
there. Already we have on our table a biil re-
storing to California what is called her " civil
fund"—a fund expended even befoie her organi-
zation as a State—amounting at present to about
half a million in the bill that has come down from
the Senate, but as a claim upon us amounting to
§1,yOl),000 m all.
We must not, however, now shrink from the
responsibilities \\ ar has biought upon us, and that
we have assumed. After we have annexed Texas,
and stretched out our arms o\er the Rocky moun-
tains to the Pacific, we cannot turn back from
what we have undertaken. All of these lands is
now our country, under our Government, and we ,
must protect and provide for them. There is no
ambition so mean as that which covets the posses-
sions of others, but grudges the cost of governing
