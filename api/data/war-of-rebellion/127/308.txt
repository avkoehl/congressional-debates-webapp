MONTGOMERY, May 10, 1861.

The CONGRESS OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA:

It is with sincere pleasure that I inform you that the government of North Carolina has accredited the Hon. Thomas L. Clingman as commissioner to represent that Commonwealth near the Government of the Confederate States. Mr. Clingman presented to me this day his letters of credence, and I received him in a manner corresponding to his station and the high purpose of his mission. If afforded me much gratification to receive from Mr. Clingman the assurance which he was instructed by his government to convey to me of the determination of his State "to link here fortunes with those of the Confederate States, and to draw the sword in the common defense of our liberties. " This proof of North Carolina's sympathy, and this promise of her early union with the Confederate States, are the more signal because conveyed by one of such high station and reputation as Mr. Clingman.

JEFF'N DAVIS.
