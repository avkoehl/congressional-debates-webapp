My piopo°itiun has, foi Humano1 ject, to a«sert the rich's of
the United "state-1> tiic country watered by the rivet Colombia,

of the conduct of Gieat Britain, who a'one disputes the title oí

when the conflicting righto of the two countries mav be deba^d
without the least h i^aid of disturbing their amicable relations
If any-arch ha¿aid existed, it would í ecomo us to encounter it

in the fii^t [ 'are I ¡shall endeavor to exhibit a ¡summary view
of the title ol the United S ates to the Oregon Territory, after
which, I shall state the consideia*iuns which, m my judgment,
íeidei it an imperative duty to take immediate measmesfor the

It ifa a pimciple, adopted by European nations in then settle

This gri leial pi maple, winch enter  into the present question

exclusive right to all the country watered by thatnvei Wuh
outiefemng to various foreign cases of the application ofthtc
doctrine, it will be sufficient for the satisfaction of the House, to
show how it has leen treated by the United States
In the letter of Messrs Monroe and Pmckney to Don Pedio
Cevallos, April 2!, 1805, it is baid
"When any European nition takes po^fssiou ot any e\tfnt

In ^. 1 lition to, and independent otall which/the natural pro-
gres ol population westward by extension, on the ground of
contiguity, would give us \ claim of title superior to that of any
othe.. nation, we occupying and settling indisputably to the
very heait of the continent
In fact, our title south of latitude^ degrees is practically ad-
mute 1 by all the rest of the world, except Great Britain An
old a "n eement existed between Russia and bpam, by which the
form r was left undisturbed m the extreme northern latitudes of
Afctefíi [N Amer Revrew No 61, p 506] After the conclu-
sion oí the Florida treaty, a convention was entered into be-
twee i the United States and Russia, whose deportment towards
this ( > intry has always been dissingmshed bj dignity and libe 
rahf —the convention of the 17th April, 1824, which closed the
door igamst any difference between us in that quarter, by an.
agic k, it that Russia would make no settlement on the north
west co rst of America south t latitude 54 degrees, and the
Unit i States none to the north oí it, thus rixrng that parallel as
the li bctwrxt our respective pretentions But the conduct
of G p it Brrtam has, I am compelled to say, been marked by
lapau v, uhberality, and gioss disregard of our just rights,
btnk ie;ly cwiilrasled with iho honorable procedure of Russia.
I)r<; iou1? of settling tin--matter fairly and liberally with Great
But the United States, m lb23, und^r the authority of Pre-
siden'Monroe, and in 1826, undei that of President Adams,
whil justly entitled to claim, by virtue of its own title, and
that Spam and France, to latitude 54 degree, offered to
Gieat Britain to compromise the question by extending the
nortl i! Une of Louisiana—that i& to bay, the parallel of 49 de-
grees— o the Pacific, thus conceding to gieat Britain five de-
grees i J latitude on the Pacific, and enabling 1 er to accom-
plish her desire to extend her possessions across the continent
from i to sea In so doing, we «houid, m fact, cede a portion
of ou ]ust rights, which covei the whole of the valley of the
Columbia, but the love oí peace, and the consideration that
Louio "■ i was bounded by latitude 49 degrees, would have
jubtm ' s-uch an arrangement lo this Great Britain obsti
nateh t i used to accede And I must now ask the attention of
the H U--0 to the nature and extent of her pretensions
I as u no, as the result of the arguments wh ch 1 have thus
curso i ¡v presented to the Hou&e, that the United States have a
cleai t t e to the Oregon ferutoiy, as against any and every
¿mop n Powei, extending from latitude 42 degrees, the line
of tho Mexican Republic to latitude 51 degrees, the line ad-
justed \ tli Russia I admit in pursuance of the negotiations
of 182. ti d 1826, that it may be wise to settle the matter, as
betwom i 4 and Git at Btitiin, at latitude 49 degrees, striking
the Pu fit in the strait of Juan de Frit a \ná I hold that the
United s rtes cannot, in safety oi in honor, concede any thing
more th i i this.
íletw i these limits Gieat Britain is unable to claim any
tt rntoi ny merely sailing rlong the t oast and touching here
ind tie because pre<eded m that bynavi^atom in the ser-
vice of v iin, all who^e right it, vested m the United States
by the 1    i tila treaty
Grea i itam cannot cl urn it ab a dopt ndency of the river
