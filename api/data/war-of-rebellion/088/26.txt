Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

Comparative quiet reigned along the lines of this army yesterday. During the night there was considerable musketry firing on the Ninth Corps front. Major-General Warren reported unmistakable evidences of the enemy mining in his front near the plank road. General Warren is counter-mining and preparing an interior line at the point threatened. About midnight dispatches received from Major-General Ord indicating the expectation a mine would be sprung in his front. This army was under arms for an hour before and after daylight this morning. The shorter and defensive line located by the engineers is being constructed.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

Deserters report Kershaw's division as having gone south on Monday night. Pickett and Field are reported by Butler as in his front. This accounts for Longstreet, Bushrod Johnson, and Hoke, which are all of Beauregard in our front. Heth and Mahone, of Hill, are also known to be in our front. Wilcox is supposed to be north of the Appomattox, but not certain. We have had no deserters from Wilcox, but those from Mahone (same corps-Hill's) say he has not left. Fitz Lee's division of cavalry is reported to have gone north of the Appomattox on day before yesterday. This is our latest information.
