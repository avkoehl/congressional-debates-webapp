small-arms, and 1,800 sets infantry accouterments. Captain Evans has no sustained ordnance officer, and consequence the duty of depot ordnance officer is imposed upon him. I recommend that an assistant be given him as soon as practicable

MEDICAL DEPARTMENT.

This department appears to be well regulated, and is under the charge of Dr. G. A. Mises. He reports the sanitary condition of the army as better that it has been during the past year. In hospital as the post there are 450 sick, many of whom are the wounded of pickets in some of the late skirmishes at Coffeeville. In camp.1,002 are reported sick. Of these, 8 are affected with small-pox. The whole army, excepting the cavalry, have been vaccinated during the past month. Ambulances are much needed, there being only 38 in the entire army. The commands are generally well supplied with medicines, but in case of a great increase of disease the present quantity will be insufficient. Dr Moses says any quantity of medical stores could be obtained from Memphis in return for cotton, and warmly recommends that it be done. I think it would be unwise to do so myself. Many medical officers are employed either by the assignment of colonels of regiments or contract. These are being relieved of duty as rapidly as commissioned surgeons and assistant arrive. Men are not allowed to leave the army on surgeon's certificate without the approval of the medical inspector, and at the post a board of surgeons decides upon discharges and leaves of absence for those in hospital. The hospitals-two in number-are kept neat and clean and appear to be well regulated generally. Surgical instructiments are much needed in this army; but ambulances, particularly, are required, and ought if possible to be supplied.

I inclose herewith a list of divisions, brigades, and regiment attached to the two corps of the army.* It will be observed that out a paper force of 20,517, 12,058 are present, making number of absentees 8,459.

Division and brigade commanders unite in saying the condition of their several commanders is good, and the commanding general reports the army generally in good fighting order.

A large proportion of these troops are from the adjacent counties; hence the number of absentees.
