So the rules were suspended
Mr DROMGOOLE stated that he cou'd not
vote for the resolution, unless it w is so modified
that the witnesses be named, and subpomas allied
He was opposed to the assumption ol power by
seiect committees m administering oaths without
special authority by the House, that is, if the
House had the power to dt-lcgate such power
Mr HARLAN moved, ¡>s a substitute, to dis-
charge the Select Comm ttce Irom the whole sub-
ject, on the ground that there was not time to go
into so extended an inquiry as was proposed, from
the e&tabiishment of the "Globe" to the present
time Tne memorialist should have come there at
the commencement of the session.
Mr THOMAS gave the history of Mr TIop-
kias's resolution, to which th s nasa substi ute-,
staling that the Editor of the Globe had not sent in
his memorial while that resolution was it ider dis
cushion, but, finding that it was not likely to be
reached again, from the awl waul mannc business
was transacted, then he petitioned ti h">\e his ac-
counts, and the cotieotne s oí hischaiges lot work,
mquiied into Mr T did not anticipate any gieat
amount of labor devolving upon the committee,
lor all thev proposed doing was to call for complete
ruturns oí the accounts, and examine a few practi-
cal printers of the D strict, m reference to their
correctness
Mr BOON expressed his astonishment at the
objection to investigation commg^from the quarter
it did, a quarter that had been heretofore so loud
and general in favor of raising committees of in-
quiry, even where the charges were indefinite
Now here was a ca<"e where the charges vveie dis-
tinct, and the individual named, and )et n is tip-
posed from that quarter As for the objection that
the mqmr) wou d interfere w tti the bus acss, it
was too ndiculius to be irain iel down, loi the
I5ou<e could £0 on asi h">d ocfore Ion Such an
argument was a r> rc«< in.crow, of nj possible va-
lidity It \\ps urgid iiPtit w as too late 11 the ses-
sion for th  commitlee to terminate their labors, if
that should bo the case, mat „ubject would fare no
worse than all the other unfim ed business of Ihe
session Mr B hop°d, when the question was
taken, it would be taken by yeas and navs, so that
the Ame can people tmgl t see how far gentlemen
pri ved consistent to their former course upon the
subject oí raising committees of inquiry into sup-
posid or charged corruptions
Mr BYNUM said like ihe honorable member
from Ind ana [Mr Boon] he had not been a little as-
tonished at the proposition made by the gentleman
from Kentucky, [Mr Harlan,] to discharge trie
coram ttee raised by ihe House upon this subject
from its further consideration After the euraoi
dinary and frequent alarms that ha 1 been made
of corruption in the different departments of the
Government, he thought such a motion, at such a
time, came with a most awkward appearance, and
n a moat questionab'e shape.
It was more than singular, that gentleman should
stand here continually, and make charges, and cry
coiruption, corruption, and when a serious propo-
sition was made in a specific shape to investigate
them, with dates and Responsible names attached
that they were the very first to oppose them, and
even to throw every obstacle in the way oí inves-
tigation that they possibly could. It was a fact that
the American people should know, to convince
them of the Hue nature of the thsusand charges
of corruption against the Administration, and to
prove that they had been almoit invariably made,
with no other view than for political effect, and
to delude and excite the public mind.
He did not see how such conduct could be ex-
culpated before the ejts of a just and intelligent
people Sir, here is a serious charge of corruption
made against an individual, involving the ¿uilt of a
pioportion of the members of this House The in-
dividual has come foiward and asked an investiga-
tion into the charges, and alter a wonderful flourish
oftrumpetson the part of the prosecutors, they hive
now come forward to discharge the committee, and
quash their prosecution, after they have circula-
ted their allegations on the four winds of
the heavens, on the flimsy pretext of there
not now having time to notice cuch stuff,
and that it ib to turn outameie whitewashing com-
mittee, to whitewash ihe charactet ol Francis P.
Blair This the gentlemen should have thought of
before making their charges of corruption against
this individual, and that portion of the House whose
guilt is involved in these charges. It is, then, due,
sir, to a portion of this Home that this investiga-
tion should be prosecuted to its end Of the indivi-
dual whosG uiaracter theie has been an attempt to
blast by this charge, he knew but little—but what
has taken place with him, as the editor oí a public
journal, and he took this occasion to say, fearlessly,
although he had been frequently assailed and de-
nounced with the bitterest epithets upon this floor
and elsewhere, that theie was not a man at the head
of so important a preis that had ever better suslaim d
lb character lor liuth and unflinching integrity, as
far as had come within his knowledge, than had the
editor of the Globe He had often listened with
the deepest solicitude and interest to the bold
and daiing chaises that had b-en made against
him oí loul corruption and profligacy, and had of-
K n been led to believe, from the apparent confi-
dence with which they Mere made, that there might
hive been some truth contained m them, but up to
this day, he boldly asserted, he had not bean able lo
sec the first scmísíí  ol evidence lo establish the
I truth of the first charge that had been brought
against him ol carruptmn or improper practices,
nor thit impeached, in the least degree, histharac
ter for veracity líe had often wished for such a
committee as had been raised, for the purpose of
investigation of many of the ehaiges that had so
frequently been mode here in relation to the acts of
presses connected with the Government, and sin-
cerely hop r1 that the presen' would be cained on
in good fa th, that the public might see thf merits
of some of those charges
lie feared,  h iwever,   from  the  writhing a d
|    twstingina certain quartei, mat corruptions, if
|  any, were about to be ¡ aeed <n other shoulder 
'    than those oí the Edit >i of the Globe     He feared
that much, fiom the 'udden chan?ei  that had taken
place in relation to this subject in a certa,u quarter,
m «bt resua to the implication of others than were
I  at first 'Xpeot d     He had heard much of cert un
barg ins and conuption about the public printing
of this Congress, wnich, if true, was  black and
damrmg, and should be exposed to public view He
hoped that *he concealment of these facts had not
wrought this sudden change in gentlemen in relation
to the subject of investigation of char0es of corrup-
tion, which tl ey nave been so fruitful m making  Let
those gentlemen now come up,  and back their
judgment, and test the sincerity of their charges
Let us see now who will snrink from carrying out
their profess, ono of anx ety to expose  corruption
They -ire here challenged to carry on their prose
cution by the party arraigned, and will they dare to
shrink back from if?   I hope not     They cannot do
it without reflecting much on the many charges
that they are in tbe habit daily of making, and cir-
|   culalmg from this place of venality and corruption
There is much about the public presses, acting
under the influence of certain institutions, that the
people ought, and should know, and tbe-e had
been no occasion more favorable, that had come
withia his observation, than the present to carry on
such an investigation.
The charge of the circulation of documents: and
speeches by the officers of the Government and
members of Congress, at the expense of the public
Treasury, is a most serious one, and ought to be
met and investigated. The people required it, the
interest of the whole country demanded the inves-
tigation of such a charge when ucfim'tly made,
and by a responsible person If true, it was a
species of corruption that should not be Dome noi
tolerated for a moment by any party Hence,
again, the great necessity of probing to the b nt m
this matter, and if the charges aie f^ul aid un-
founded, the public should know it, par initially ui
relation to the franking privilege, how far it has been
abused, an'l by whom There were other means, as
he had understood, of getting docu neris griliuioushj
furnished to members, that he should a'ao be
glad to have mquued into, but of which he knew no-
thing of his own knowledge It was but sheer ju -
tice to the public that the whole truth m rc'anon (o
these matters should go forth to the people, that
they might see the character ol the engines at work
to fabricate public opinion, anl from, what source
at last came the means by which this w hole ma-
chinery was put and kept m operation
The" gentleman from Kentucky ha 1 n ovc4 to
discharge the committee and suppress all furth
investigation This, too, was most singular, ct n
sidenng that the honorable member did not b^l ig
to the committee, and could know but little of their
ability or means to investigate this subject, durn g
this session, nor had he cared even to inquire Su^n
a proposition, he thought,would mueh m ire appro
pnately have come from one of the members ot t e
committee, who, it might be presumed, Kn v som°
thing of the opportunities of carrying oi the n-
vestigation
He hoped the member would think belter of h s
course, and withdraw his extraordinary proposi on
to discharge the committee, and that the re olulio i
to prosecute the investigation would pre/ail, aril
leave given them to send for person0 at, i paper*, n
dtemed important or necessary to the development
ol the truth m relation to ths sub]ect He should
certainly vote for the fullest an 1 freest i"vest ga-
gation into this matter, and hoped the House wou'd
>ustam the proposition, and resist eveiy atteni t to
thwart, by indirection, th* examination into t¡,3
facts
Mr HVRLAN wuhd e\v his mot on to d s-
charge the ce nmittee, anu m ived the fo'l wi'¡¡
" Ind that the said com mtteebe instructed fuith
er to inquire and report 'o tins House how and to
whom the patronage of the Government has be°n
paid for printing and for the publication of the law s
of the United Stales, what editors of newspapers
have been deprived of the publication of the laws,
and tbe reasons therefor, and the coiresponlence
relating to that subject, and to inquire into a'1
■ abuses, if aay, which have arisen under the existing
laws and regulations up m the s thj-c t of trie publ c
printing and the publication oí the laws, an I, to ti is
end, that tbe committee have leave to sit during th.
ieeess of Congress "
Mi. STANLY moved the folhnvu g anendment
to the amendment, which Mr Harun accents as
a further modification of his amend i cut
"And that said committee be further mstruc H to
inquire by what authority a laue number oí ex ra
Globes were folded with ihe Messages which tie re
ordered by members m the early pait of the se s tn,
without their knowledge and consent, an \ tia
transmitted at the public expense, an 1 th it taev
also inquire under what arrangement he id tor of
the Globe had the exclusive pr nting oí sai i Mes-
sage, and was th is enabled to pracu esq^n device "
Mr DUNCAN made an earnest ap> eal to t*V3
House, asan act of justice to the me>iiona is(, who
had been charged there and elsewher-, to adopt th 
original resolution, especially a*, wihout it, the
committee could not perform the duty assign 1
them. He hoped, after all these grave charge hi I
been made, that there was no intention of shl n >-
ing from  their investigation, by  loading it wit i
