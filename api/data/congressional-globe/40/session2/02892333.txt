Resolved, That tho Secretary of the Navy be re-

a list of the vessels and property captured or de-
stroyed by the Navy of tho United States from April
15,1861, to April 20,1SG5, with the disposition made
of each capture, the names of the vessels interested,
and the cause of delay in the payment of the prize-
mouey to the parties in accordance with existing laws.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I ask the gentleman from
Pennsylvania [Mr. O'Neill] to modify his res-
olution so as to extend the inquiry to all ves-
sels captured during the war.
Mr. O'NEILL. I have no objection to that.
I modify the resolution by substituting "during
the war'- for the words "from April 15, 18151,
to April 20, 1865."
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I ask the
gentleman from Pennsylvania to permit an-
other amendment: to ask the Secretary of the
Navy the reason why he has not answered a
resolution of the House of the 6th of January
in regard to the purchase and sale of vessels.
Mr. O'NEILL. I have no objection to that
inquiry ; but I think it had better not be in-
eluded in this resolution, which refers merely
to the vessels captured during the war and the
distribution of the prize-money.^ The object
is that the many men who are waiting for these
small sums of money may know why they are
not forthcoming.
The resolution, as modified, was adopted,
notice of business.
Mr. BROOKS. Mr. Speaker, I want to avail
myself of a proper opportunity to call the atten-
tion ofthe House, either asa privileged question
or in some other form, to the official report of
the impeachment proceedings with reference to
the connection of some of the managers with the
Alta Vela affair; and I should like to do it to-day
after the Senate has adjourned.
The SPEAKER. That matter cannot be
considered at this time, as no business can be
entertained except by unanimous consent, and
nothing that will occupy anv time. Tho gen-
tleman from New York, [Mr. BPvOOKS,] as the
Chair understands, gives notice that business
may be expected this afternoon after the return
ofthe House to the Hall.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I desire to
give notice that after the return of the House
from the Senate, this afternoon I shall ask the
House to consider the Senate amendments to
the naval appropriation bill. I will say further
that I presume no questions of any particular
interest will arise, as the Committee on Appro-
priations recommend concurrence with most
of the amendments of the Senate, which are in
the line of economy, and recommend non-con-
currence in two or three others, which will
probably go to a committee of conference.
