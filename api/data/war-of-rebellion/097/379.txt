ORD'S HEADQUARTERS, March 31, 1865-2 p..m

General WRIGHT,

Sixth Corps:

I have ordered a reconnaissance on my right, and if it is reported feasible shall order an advance; but from reports of deserters I apprehend we will not get farther than their picket, as main line is said to be heavily slashed and abatises. Shall let you know result of examination. My left has driven their pickets in their works.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA, ARMY OF THE JAMES,Before Richmond, Va., March 31, 1865.

Major-General WRIGHT,

Sixth Corps:

I have advanced the left and center of my line, and h ave driven the enemy's pickets into the main line. The examination along the right of my line does not develop any point where I think it advisable to attack this evening, and not until I can place batteries in position to keep down the fire from the enemy will I assault.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

[General J. W. TURNER:]

GENERAL: Let me know at once what you are doing, whether you have advanced your line of battle, and what is the chance for an assault in your front. If you want any more troops send me word and order up any of General Foster's troops that are available. Take charge of what forces General Foster has immediately on your right.

Respectfully,

JOHN GIBBON,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FOURTH CORPS,March 31, 1865.

MY DEAR TURNER: General Ord agrees with me that the enemy will not let us hold our present position if he can help it, so keep your pickets on the alert and be under arms before daylight. Use a part of your force to-night in strengthening your line and connecting with Foster's line. I do not think the assault will be ordered in the morning.

JOHN GIBBON,

Major-General, Commanding.
