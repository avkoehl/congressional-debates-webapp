IN SENATE.
Thursday, December 7, 1848.
Mr. Borland, of Arkansas, and Mr. Rusk, of
Texas, appeared in their seats 10-day.
The Journal having been read,
On motion, it was ordered, that when the Sen-
ate adjourns, it adjourn to meet on Monday.
DEATH OF DIXON H. LEWIS.
Mr. KING then rose, and addressed the Senate
i as follows:
! I rise, Mr. President, to call the attention of this
; honorable body to an afflictive dispensation of
j Providence, which has deprived the Senate of the
: United States of one of its most esteemed and
| honored members, the country of a talented and
I useful citizen, and the State of Alabama of a vigi-
j lant and faithful representative.
On the 25th day of October last, and in the 47th
I year of his age, Dixon H. Lewis, a Senator from
the State of Alabama, breathed' his last in the city
of New York. Although far from his home, he
was surrounded by anxious and devoted friends.
The amiable and affectionate partner of his bosom
watched over him with that tender care which
tione but woman could bestow; and nothing was
omitted which, it was believed, could contribute to
his recovery, aliay his sufferings, or soothe his
dying moments. His immortal spirit calmly passed
away without a struggle, and his lifeless body
alone remained to his bereaved family and sorrow-
ing friends.
Then it was, Mr. President, thai the Mayor and-
Common Council of the city of New York, actu-
ated byjhat liberal spirit which has ever character-
ized'the emporium of our country, desirous o{.
showing the high respect in. which they hekl that
distinguished individual for his many private vir-
tues and useful public services, asked and obtained'
permission to take upon itself the necessary ar-
rangements for his funeral. They were of a public
character, and conducted in such a manner as could
not fail to be most gratifying to the family and
friends of the deceased.
His body reposes in the beautiful grounds of
Greenwood, in the identical spot, as I am informed,
where he once expressed a wish'to be interred,
should it so happen that his earthly career should
be terminated while in its vicinity. Providence
so ordered it; and I avail myself of this occasion
to tender to the Mayor and Common Council of
.the city of- New York, the .gratitude of the State
of Alabama for the distinguished respect paid to
the memory of one of her most honored and cher-
ished sonSi  
Mr. Lewis, Mr. Jpresident, was a native of the
State of Georgia. He received his education at
the College of South Carolina, where, by his so-
cial qualities, he endeared himself -to his asso-
ciates; while his scholastic attainments furnished
evidence that he wa3 possessed of talents of a supe-
rior order, and pointed him out as one destined to
acquire reputation in whatever pursuit he might
engage.
On the completion of his collegiate course, Mr.
Lewis removed to the State of Alabama, became
a student in a law office, and, by close application,
soon qualified himself for the bar. He obtained
a license to practise in the several courts of the
State. His professional career was short, but he
had obtained a reputable standing; and had he con-
tinued to pursue the profession, he must soon have
become eminent as a lawyer. The inclination,
however, of Mr. Lewis immediately led him
to engage in politics. He became a candidate
for the State Legislature, and the people of the
county in which he resided elected him with great
unanimity as one of its members. Although quite
a young man, he very soon acquired a commanding
influence with the members of the House in which
he served.
.Mr. Lewis was what is termed a State-rights
man, a strict constructionist; and, while a mem-
ter of the Legislature, rendered himself conspicu-
TOs by an able advocacy of resolutions denying to
Congress the power to establish a national bank,
to impose a tariff for protection, or to execute
works of internal improvement. His opinions
were in accordance with those of a large majority
of the people of Alabama; and in the year 1829,
as I believe, he was elected Jjy the Congressional
district in which he resided to represent them in
the Congress of the United States. He continued,
without intermission, to serve in the House of
Representatives until the spring of the year 1844,
commanding, by his talents, firmness, and urban-
ity, the respect and confidence of its members.
In 1844 a vacancy was produced in the Senate
;j of the United States by my resignation, and Mr.
; Lewis was appointed by the Governor of A!a-
, bama to fill the vacancy. On the meeting of the
j State Legislature, the selection of the Governor
i was approved, and Mr. Lewis was elected, with-
j out opposition, for the unexpired term. Again
I vvas he chosen-, at the session of the Legislature of
' the last winter, for the full term of six years.
| Few, Mr. President, very few of the distin-
] guished men of our country have, for so long a
period, maintained their position in the councils of
' the nation, and have more firmly adhered to the
. frmciples they professed, than my late lamented
! colleague. Most of the Senators present have'
1 served with him, and to them 1 can fearlessly ap-
] peal to bear testimony to the high estfem in which
j he was held by his brother Senators, and to the
! zeal and ability with which he discharged the
I various duties which devolved uonn him.
j But it is not my purpose to pronounce a eulog-y
^ on the life and public services of Di: son II. Lr. wis.
; They are known and properly appreciated by his
! countrymen; and nothing which 1 could say would
| add to his well-earned reputation, or cause his loss
i w L>e more deeply lamented. He has gone from
