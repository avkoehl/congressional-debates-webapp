III. No prisoners of war will be allowed to leave the buildings or grounds in which they are confined except in the cases provided for in paragraph IV of this order, and permission to enjoy limits beyond such grounds, whether based upon the parolees of the prisoners or other reasons, will not be accorded.

IV. Whenever the health of prisoners requires their removal from the places of confinement to hospitals or convalescent camps the removal will be made only on the certificate of the medical officer of the post. The surgeon of the hospital or camp to which such prisoners are removed will, on their recovery, notify the officer from whose charge they were taken, in order that they may be taken back to the place of confinement under guard.
