as to increase Colonel Carter's command to a brigade. I wish to be advised as to the facts. If it be so that such authority is vested in Colonel Carter or others I can only repeat what I have already said, that it will defeat every effort I can make to raise infantry. If cavalry is to be raised I claim the right to furnish them in such manner as will entitle the State to credit for them. I cannot understand why individuals should be placed on a more favorable footing in the raising of men than the State authorities. If cavalry is wanted I could fill your requisition in twenty days. I hope to hear from you at your earliest convenience. I am exerting every influence and power to comply with the requisition made upon me, and were I left untrammeled and permitted to act independently of gentlemen having roving commissions my efforts would be successful. I inclose an order that I was constrained to issue.

Yours, very respectfully,

F. R. LUBBOCK.
