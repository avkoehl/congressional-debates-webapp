HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,OFFICE OF THE PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL,

November 29, 1864.

Major General G. G. MEADE, Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Three deserters from the enemy and two prisoners of war forwarded to-day. The prisoners of war are two of Hampton's scouts, taken in the late cavalry reconnaissance. The deserters are all from the Seventeenth South Carolina, Wallace's brigade (Evans' old); bring no late information. One of them states that he saw Richmond papers of the 27th instant containing information from Sherman. He had passed through Macon and Milledgeville, and was moving two columns, one by the State road to Augusta, and the other by the Macon road to Savannah; was rumored that he had taken Augusta. Nothing had thus far opposed him but Wheeler's cavalry, some 7,000 strong. Contrabands from Prince George and Sussex Counties report that some 200 negroes are at work on the new railroad branch at Stony Creek; commenced laying the ties last Friday. The junction is about a quarter of a mile north of the station. Its course will follow the new military road. Some of the most intelligent contrabands think it is not intended to connect with the South Side Railroad, and will only be a short branch of a few miles to facilitate the transportation of forage, the roads in the vicinity being impassable in winter.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers C. BABCOCK.
