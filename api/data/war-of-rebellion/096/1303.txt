General R. E. LEE, Commanding, &amp;c.:

How shall I ascertain whether the enemy is moving down north side of James? I have not enough of cavalry to feel him with. I have heard nothing of the movements of the enemy since I saw you on Tuesday last, except a telegram from Mrs. Longstreet, saying that the danger at Lynchburg was all past. Please furnish me with such information as you have.

A letter from a man in Terry's brigade, Pegram's division, addressed to a man in Humphrey's brigade, who deserted some days ago, has just been opened. The writer thereof, G. M. Keizer, states that he sis going to desert to-morrow, in company with several others. I cannot find out his regiment.
