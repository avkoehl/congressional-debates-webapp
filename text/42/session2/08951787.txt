1872.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
1787
as they are not required to hold it by law.
In 1870 the banks of the city of New York
held on about thirty-two millions of circulation
$34,097,000, or over one hundred per cent, of
gold according to the circulation. That was
immediately after the 1st of January, 1870.
It will be observed that they must have dis-
posed of this gold shortly after, as their average
was very much less. The other cities of re-
demption on about seventy-two million dollars
of circulation held of specie $8,307,000, or
about eleven per cent. They should have held,
under sucli a bill as I present, $18,000,000.
The other banks which are not included in the
cities of redemption, with $203,000,000, held
$3,145,000 of specie, or about one aud a half
per cent, of the amount of their circulation,
whereas they would have held, as per present
proposition, $30,440,000, which would make
the entire gold reserve $56,000,000. They all
held $46,000,000 at that time, which was
greatly above their average; consequently they
must shortly after have disposed of a large
amount of this gold. It is simply used as a
commercial commodity at this time, not
having any particular value for any purpose
other than for export and to pay the duties on
imports.
Now, the question arises, shall we, in a
time of prosperity, prepare for the days of
adversity? It is said that in time of peace
we must prepare for war. It is equally true
that in this time of prosperity we should make
some provision for the future. In case of war
the small amount of specie now held in the
United States—less, I believe, than the amount
previous to the war—would be very soon drained
liom our Treasury, being concentrated at the
great cities of export. Consequently, if we
adopt this bill, compelling the banks through-
out the country to hold their reserve in specie
on their circulation, we shall have a fund to
draw from in time of adversity or in time of
war. This I consider as a very important
matter as connected with the future. If we
continue to export as we have heretofore the
specie, we shall not increase the amount of
specie only as we may want the gold to pay
our import duties, which is at the great cen-
ters. Jn 1864 our exports of specie amounted
to $92,000,000 in round numbers; in 1865 the
amount of specie exported was $57,000,000 in
round numbers; in 1866, $75,000,000; in 1867,
$38,000,000. During the past eleven months
of this year we have exported in specte
$57,661,842. The amount of our imports
over exports, as I have it stated here, reaches
$520,276,668. Our domestic exports amount
to $400,474,406,-leaving a deficit of $119,-
801,863. To pay this we are obliged to send
abroad. The amount of gold exported over
and above that imported was $57,061,842,
still leaving a deficit against us of $62,140,-
021 to be paid by bonds of the United States
and bonds of the various railroad companies,
which must have been exported to meet this
deficit, and this only for eleven months, aud
added to that the amount for one additional
month, about five million dollars, which will
bring it up to about sixty-eight million dollars
deficit during the past year. In 1870 we did
not export so much. In eleven months we
exported in specie $53,401,220. So that it
seems, notwithstanding the requirements were
larger for specie for payment of duties in
1871, we have exported largely in excess of
the amount we did in 1870.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Oregon will please suspend. The morn-
ing hour has expired, and the tariff bill is
before the Senate.
Mr. MORItlLL, of Vermont. I trust the
Senator from Oregon will be allowed to con-
clude his remarks.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Tlie Senator
from Iowa gave notice that he desired to call
up the unfinished business at one o'clock.
Mr. CORBETT. I think I shall not take
over five or ten minutes.
Mr. SPENCER. I hope the Senator from
Oregon will have unanimous consent to pro-
C66Cl.
Mr. WRIGHT. I desire to say that I re-
gret exceedingly to interrupt the line of the
Senator's remarks. If he can conclude his
remarks in five minutes—I dislike very much
even to limit him^-I shall not object.
Mr. CORBETT. It will not take over five
or ten minutes to conclude my remarks.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair
understands from the gesture of the Senator
| from Iowa that he consents to ten minutes.
The unfinished -business will be informally
passed over for ten minutes.
Mr. CORBETT. I have statistics here of
the average price of gold since 1862, which it
is very important to have printed for reference,
and I shall furnish it to the reporter.* I do
notdesire to take up the time of the Senate by
going into details, but it shows the gradual
rise of gold from 1862 to 1864, from one per
cent, to one hundred and eighty-five, and the
gradual decrease from 1864 to 1871, when it
reached the lowest point of per cent.,
and averaged during 1870 about fifteen per
cent. We all know that as long as there is
deficiency in gold, or as long as it is concen-
trated at one point, principally at the city of
New York, the price of gold is controlled, and
it is advanced or depressed according to the
demand or according to the specula'ive foeling
in that gold. One object of this bill is to pre-
vent that. The object is that it shall be dis-
tributed throughout the country. If they have
the requisite amount of gold in the banks at
the close of two and a half years they will
have no use for their gold except to dispose
of it to their customers when they may desire
it throughout the country. Whenever a person
presents one of their bills and desires gold,
they can pay it.
It has this advantage also : when the Gov-
ernment is prepared at the end, we will say,
of two'and a half years to return to specie pay-
ments, when it gives noticc to the people that
it will resume specie payments, there will be
no object for the banks to present legal tenders
and claim specie, as they will already have
their reserve. Consequently there will be no
demand upon the Treasury for gold from the
banks, and they will have no demand from the
people, because they will not desire it as they
can get the gold from the banks, if they desire,
at any time for small amounts for their local
use. This is very important as tending to
bring our people back to the idea of an inter-
national currency.
But now, sir, as the banks have not their
specie reserve, as soon as the Government
gives notice that it is prepared to resume
specie payments, what will tlie banks do ?
The banks at once flood the Treasury with
the legal tenders, demanding the gold that
they may be prepared to resume specie pay-
ments at the same lime. This bill, when
adopted, will simply prepare them for specie
payments; the bill does not say that the
banks shall resume specie payments at that
time. It is not intended to be compulsory,
but it simply puts them in condition to re-
sume specie payments, and it places them as
well as the country in a more sound, healthy
condition. When the people know they can
obtain gold, they will not wish to present the
bills for it.
My remarks arc not perhaps as extended as
I should like to have made them on this bill,
giving in more detail the effects of the bill and
the importance of it; but 1 desire to say that
I think it is the duty of tlie Republican parly,
whioh is responsible for this Administration
