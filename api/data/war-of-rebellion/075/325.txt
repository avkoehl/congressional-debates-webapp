General Thomas directs that you cover Howard's left, expecting that you will be ready to march by 10 a.m. Does the 80 killed and wounded include any of the 54 prisoners? Endeavor to keep two days' forage on hand by bringing it forward on pack-mules if your train is not near enough. Have you heard from Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart?
