CORINTH, June 29, 1862.

Major-General SHERMAN, Moscow:

You will assume command of Hurlbut's division, and also the part of McClernand's at Grand Junction. Hamilton will reach Holly Springs on Tuesday morning, and will expect your co-operation.

I get no information of McClellan from Washington. Rebels at Chattanooga say he was defeated on the 27th.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
HDQRS. FIFTH DIVISION, ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Moscow, Tenn., June 29, 1862.

General HALLECK, Corinth, Miss.:

I have been studying my maps. If Hamilton passed Hatchie yesterday he had 65 miles to reach Holly Springs. Is he coming by Ripley? On your present order I shall be at Holly Springs Tuesday morning, but I doubt if Hamilton can reach it before Wednesday night. Troops cannot march these hot days. You cannot count over 12 miles a day with trains.

I would go to Holly Springs light, and would therefore march with more rapidity. If possible, it would be well for Hamilton to send a messenger to the Junction announcing his presence at Ripley and fixing the time of his approach to Holly Springs.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. FIFTH DIVISION, ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Moscow, Tenn., June 29, 1862.

General HALLECK, Corinth, Miss.:

One of my most successful scouts, Sergeant Gould, was in Holly Springs five days ago, and he reported one regiment of cavalry and 4,000 infantry in Holly Springs. He saw them and their tents and was certain Breckinridge was there.

I will leave one regiment at the Junction, one at La Grange, and one here, each with a section of artillery, and with the effective force of the remaining regiments I will move on Holly Springs to-morrow afternoon, so as to reach it Tuesday morning.

I have to send a wagon train into Memphis, which I will do by the back road, viz, one leading to the Stage road, which keeps on the north side of Wolf River and enters by Raleigh. I suppose Grant has taken measures to cover his end of the road. I protect it from the Junction to La Fayette. By advancing my whole force south I do not uncover the road. No trains have ever reached me from any quarter.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

P. S.-To protect this section of the road a large an efficient cavalry force will be indispensable. There is plenty of forage. Mine and Hurlbut's forces of cavalry are insignificant and are hardly enough for picket duty.
