I am now guarding thirty-two miles with 350 men, and my men are on duty day and night. The Sixty-first Illinois are moving their camp to Devall's Bluff, leaving no troops on the road except my own regiment.

Lee, was making a raid into Pennsylvania and Maryland. Sigel had stopped them at Maryland Heights, and they were being surrounded by our troops.
