artillery, and the Hudson Battery, captured at the same time and place. You will please add these to the list of officers and men declared exchanged.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

Agent of Exchange.

RICHMOND, VA., October 27, 1863.

Brigadier General S. A. MEREDITH, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I cannot agree that a prisoner on captivity shall be exchanged for one on parole, as you request in your letter of October 18, 1863. I am willing, however, to exchange Henry D. Barnett, Fifteenth Kentucky Cavalry, for either of the parties named in my communication of October 16, 1863.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAS DEPARTMENT,

Richmond, October 27, 1863.

Brigadier General S. A. MEREDITH, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I inclose to you a memorandum of the paroles to which I have referred in several recent communications. Most of these paroles, you will observe, are antecedent to May 23, 1863. The reason why these paroles have not been heretofore discharged is that up to July, 1863, we had the advantage of prisoners and paroles. Not one of these paroles is covered by any declaration of exchange, except the one lately made by you. For no one of them have I received any equivalent. All of them since the date of your General Orders, Numbers 207, were given in pursuance of a distant agreement between the commanders of two opposing armies. I have many other paroles in my possession, but I have only presented those which are within the terms of your general orders, according to their respective dates.

I understand there are other paroles coming within the same general orders, which were given by your officers and men on the other side of the Mississippi River. They as yet have not reached me. When they do, and when I show they are within the scope of your general orders, I will claim them; otherwise I will discard them.
