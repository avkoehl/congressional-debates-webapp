HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS, June 4, 1864.

Major-General MEADE,Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: In my dispatch to you, June 2, reporting my operations of the 1st instant, I find I have made an error, which I hasten to correct. In a verbal report to me, I understood General Devens, commanding Third Division of my corps, positively to say that his first line preceded the first line of Sixth Corps on his left in the assault in the woods and the capture of the rifle-pits. In a further conversation with him this morning, he says this was not so, and that he was preceded by the first line of the Sixth Corps. I regret exceedingly the injustice unintentionally done the Sixth Corps, and beg that my dispatch be corrected to this extent.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General, Commanding.
