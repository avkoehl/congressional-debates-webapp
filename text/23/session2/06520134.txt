184                                      THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.   ^                     January 17,
claims, including this, and paid  out the whole
amount to others than the present claimant
Mr. WHITE, of Florida, recapitulated the cir-
cumstances attendant on the execution of the
treaty between the United States and Spam, by
which Florida was ceded to the former In an-
swer to an inquiry of the gentleman from Virgi-
nia, [Mr AKCHER,]Mr.W said the United States
did, by the terms of that treaty, assume the claims
of our'citizens against that Government.
Mr. POLK regretted that some members of the
committee had not prepared themselves to meet
this bill It was an old acquaintance in the House,
and had long ago been rejected by a vote of more
than two to one. Mr P opposed the validity of
the claim at considerable length, and gave a suc-
cinct statement of the formei proceedings both of
Congress and of a commission appointed for the
purpose several years ago in reference to it. If
the House adopted this bill, they would be reopen-
ing a mass of claims to an amount of not less than
thirty-nine millions of dolíais, which would come
under the same principle Mr P. also contended
that there was no additional evidence presented at
this time more than was before the Spanish com-
mission, and on which they had heretofore adju-
dicated, and appealed to the honorable chairman
of the committee if this was not so
Mr ARCHER said if the bill should pass, he
was given to understand that additional testimony
would be adduced.
Mr. POLK said, then he was right; there was
no evidence before the House than was before the
commission, and, by passing the bill, the House
would be entei taming an appeal fiom a tribunal of
its own cieation, to the hazaid of many millions
of the public treasury. Mr P said if he could
believe there was one dollar due to this individual
claimant, he would cheerfully lend his feeble aid
towards its recovery He sincerely desired strict
justice to every American citizen He concluded
by expressing a wish that the bill might not be
decided upon to day, but a fuither time might be
given foi its investigation.
Mr. ARCHER asked for the reading of the
bill, by which the House would perceive that it
embraced no appropuation,but simply directed an
investigation to be made by the Attorney General
and two Auditors.
The bill having been read by the Clerk,
Mr POLE called for the reading of the bill of
1828, which having been done, Mr P. said the
first two sections of both bills were the same, but
the one before the House contained a provision
for the payment of theclaim, should adecision be
mode in its favor, which was not in the former
one
Mr ARCHER said he was not aware before
that the bill contained a clause for the payment of
the claim He moved that this clause he stncken
out
Mr EVERETT, of Massachusetts, called for
the reading of a document which had some beanng
on the question. The íeport of the committee of
1826 was then read by the Cleik
Mr E said it was tiue that the bill of 1828 was
lost by avote of two to one, buthe would remind
the House that, in 1826, the same bill pasbed by
a majority of not less than two to one, and the
honorable gentleman from Tennessee voted in the
affirmative
Mr POLK said the bill of 1826 was brought
on at a late hour of the evening, at the heel of the
session, and he would admit that he did vote, as
peí haps otheisdid, in the dark as to the facts,and
without having given the subject due examina-
tion Mi P also remembered that his vote was
quoted against him on occasion of the lejection
of the bill of 1828, and he then gave a similar
explanation,
Mr EVERETT continued to advocate the
claim, which, he contended, was founded m truth
and justice, and tested upon its own merits, with
out reference to the other claims alleged by the
gentleman fiom Tennessee to be involved in the
same principle He could see no evil that could
result from its refeience to a board for investiga-
tion
Mr HARDIN said, he regretted that business
of another character had compelled him to be
absent during the greater pan of this discussion,
but he desired   to give his sentiments  on this
claim, since it was one which he had investigated
at a former session He would proceed, if it was
the pleasure of the committee, but as the hour
was late, he moved that the committee rise.
The motion being agreed to, the committee
rose, reported progress, and obtained lea%e to sit
again.
On motion of Mr HUBBARD,
The House then adjourned.

ACCOUNTS OF THE WAR AND NAVY DEPART-
MENTS.
Mr MANN, of New York, asked the House
to consider two resolutions which he had (by per-
mission) laid upon the table a few days since—
requesting the Secretaries of the War and Navy
Departments, respectively, to furnish copies and
statements of the items and aggregates of the com-
pensation, accounts of the officers of the army and
navy, including all stated and special allowances
of every description, for the two lastyeais, and
showing, also, their travel, and grades,and where
stationed, and what services they have perfoimed.
Mr. M said, that he had been informed, since
these resolutions have been laid upon the table,
that it was not probable they could be answered
in season to permit any action of the House upon
the subject at this session, and wishing to afford
the depaitments ample time to make full and
accurate repoits, he would take occasion now to
say, that on the coming in of such íepoits at the
next session, he would ask for the appointment
of a committee, to consider and thoroughly inves-
tigate the subject in the hope that ample, equal,
and even liberal justice, mignt be done to all the
officers engaged in those branches of the public
service.
