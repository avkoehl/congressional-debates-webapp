CITY POINT, January 9, 1865

Major-General WARREN:

Did you find any considerable amount of forage on your march toward Weldon? Is there any in the country near our lines and within our reach? Will you please reply by telegraph to-night?

RUFUS INGALLS,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,January 9, 1865-7.45 p.m.

Brigadier-General INGALLS,

Chief Quartermaster, City Point:

Major-General Warren being absent on leave, I have the honor to reply to your telegram of this p.m. The amount of forage discovered by us on our late expedition was not large, and this was either consumed by our cavalry and artillery and train animals or was burned. The country adjacent to the line of march seemed quite bare.

Respectfully,

FRED. T. LOCKE

Brevet Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,January 9, 1865-10.40 a.m.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The enemy made a dash a little before 6 o'clock this a.m. upon the left of the Third and right of the Second Division of the corps, firing one volley and then returning. Three or four men are missing. It is possible that some or all of them skulked back to camp. When ascertained the loss, if any, will be reported. There seems to have been no confusion. The troops were all under arms at once. With this exception, nothing to report for the last twenty-four hours.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.

I have telegraphed to the Secretary of War leave to publish my report of the Wilmington affair. I have received no answer. He is absent. In his absence I respectfully ask your leave to publish it. General Grant favored it. It is but justice. Please answer by telegraph.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.
