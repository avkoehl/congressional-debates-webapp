be kept well in hand near some accessible point, save the necessary scouts needed below to watch movements and give early information, so that should the enemy advance from the Mississippi River or from the direction of Memphis Colonel Maury can be thrown rapidly by railroad to re-enforce General Wirt Adams, no other troops being available for this purpose in the present emergency.

Very respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Colonel GARNER,

Chief of Staff:

The troops were sent in good time last night on the steamer Dorrance, and one Reserve regiment was ordered to return; but General Gibson feeling sure they would assault his line heavily, and having his dispositions all made, retained the Reserve regiment.

Colonel GARNER,

Chief of Staff:

Sent telegraphic report of casualties at fort yesterday. Will commence work on treadway and piles for wire at Huger to-day. Lieutenant Elmore, in charge of this work, has been assigned to other duty by some authority not mine. Two men wounded at Minette bridge. No advance of the enemy from Sibley's Mills. The work here is progressing as fast as possible. Skirmishers attacking Spanish Fort now. Portions of the enemy's camps in the roads near Bay Minette as far up as Boggy Branch can be reached by guns from Huger. I think the improper direction of the gun yesterday ought not to prevent us from using it to-day. Solid shot or percussion-shell can be used effectively, and will demoralize the enemy. Will General Maury be over to-day? The enemy's skirmish line of yesterday is a line of battle to-day.

Captain WINSTON,

Commanding Scouts:

CAPTAIN: General Liddell directs that you send a scout immediately toward Stockton, to ascertain whether or not the enemy are at Stockton, or Montgomery Hill, as it has been reported that the enemy are at those places. You will direct the officer in charge to find out the facts, and only report what he knows to be the truth.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. L. D. LEWIS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
