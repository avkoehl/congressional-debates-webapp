CHATTANOOGA, July 17, 1863.

General J. E. JOHNSTON:

The loss of Mississippi involves Mobile; that virtually includes all the productive part of Alabama. Upon you rests the hope of the country. Our success can only result from concentration. This country can be risked under Buckner or myself. For the time leave my cvalry and from two to four brigades of infantry. Concentrate all else by the most rapid means under your own orders and strike at once. Success in our deliverance; failure would be no more than defeat in detail. Take me or not, as you think best. I have no orders from Richmond, or do not think the enemy can advance here in force for six weeks.

General, Commanding.
