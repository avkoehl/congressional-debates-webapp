I have driven the enemy's cavalry out of this place. Wickham's brigade retreating up the valley. I learn from reliable sources that Anderson's division of infantry crossed at Buckton and went on up the valley, crossing the South Fork at McCoy's Ford, eight miles from here. I believe this perfectly reliable, and shall push on to see. The force which crossed were said to be "crossing all day." I will send more definite information as soon as it can be got.
