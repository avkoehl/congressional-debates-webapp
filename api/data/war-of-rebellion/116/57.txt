and canister ammunition. A guard-boat would be required at all times when the bay is free of ice.

The prevelance of stormy weather at this season of the year along the lake shore would greatly retard the work, and I doubt if the necessary buildings could be erected before the 1st of January. Though I propose the heat the rooms with stoves yet brick chimneys would be required for them, and brick furnaces or fireplaces would be needed in the kitchen.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Lieutenant Colonel Eighth Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
