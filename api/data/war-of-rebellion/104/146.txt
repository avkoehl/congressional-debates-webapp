HEADQUARTERS ENGINEER BRIGADE,March 30, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have worked all the officers and men of the Ninety-sixth and Ninety-seventh U. S. Colored Infantry almost day and night since [they have been] at this place. If I send the Ninety-seventh it will stop my wharf building and greatly delay the unloading of supplies, as it takes all the One hundred and sixty-first [New York] for provost and picket duty, but will send it if you say so.

Yours, respectfully,

J. BAILEY,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. ARMY AND DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,March 30, 1865.

Brigadier General J. BAILEY:

The Ninety-seventh will not be sent. Your reasons are entirely satisfactory.
