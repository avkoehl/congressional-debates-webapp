APRIL 9, 1864.

Respectfully returned to the Secretary of War.

The guns can be furnished whenever definite orders are resolved on. General Beauregard intimates on a previous paper that he has no troops to defend such works. In that case so heavy an armament would be captured. I have written to General T. asking whether 8-inch siege guns on traveling carriages would not answer his purpose.

Honorable WILLIAM PORCHER MILES, M. C.,

SIR: Herewith I return the papers* left with me relative to the Torch.

This boat was transferred upon the application of General Beauregard by this department to the army to be fitted as a torpedo-boat by Captain Lee, together with the iron necessary to shield her, and I will be glad to render such further aid in altering and preparing her for service as the materials on hand the condition of the work in progress under this department will permit.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. R. MALLORY,

Secretary of the Navy.

Respectfully referred to Commodore Ingraham, for his information and remarks.

I should be pleased for him to state also in what condition was the Torch when turned over to the army for the purpose indicated, in what condition when returned to the navy, and what amount of iron plating belonging to the navy, but imported by the army, was transferred back to the navy.

Brigadier General W. S. WALKER,

General Gillmore is reported to have left Jacksonville soon as General Beauregard's arrival in his front was known. Cannot your scouts get accurate information of what is going on on the islands and at Beaufort?
