BALTIMORE, MD., June 16, 1863-4 p. m.

Major General H. W. Halleck,

General-in-Chief:

A telegram from Harrisburg says rebels to-day within 10 miles of Carlisle, and expected they would cut Northern Central Railroad below York this p. m. If they should visit Baltimore, it will probably be with cavalry coming in on the north side of the city. I will have, with what little infantry I have, only one regiment to guard approaches. Have no field artillery here. The forts, you know, I have had to strip of nearly all garrisons; should have none to make sorties, or act on flank, and in Fort Marshall not sufficient for relief to work all the guns. I may get three or four companies of well-drilled infantry (militia) they have in the city into Fort Marshall.
