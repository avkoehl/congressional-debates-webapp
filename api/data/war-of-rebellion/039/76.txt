I have instructed General Kelley to look to the west, on the railroad, in anticipation of the rebels pushing farther north; also to co-operate with and support General Roberts, who will concentrate his forces, now principally at Beverly, Buckhannon, and Bulltown as far as practicable on some point farther westward. I think the movement is a raid that must necessarily come and go soon. What we most feel the need of, to meet it, is cavalry.

Governor Peirpoint telegraphs from Point Pleasant:

We are fighting, and trying to retake the place. We are driving them.

General Cox telegraphs from Point Pleasant at 5 p.m.; says rebels were repulsed and have retired. No further particulars. I hope that part of Scammon's force is within reach of them also from above.

Under the orders given by General Scammon, I hope to hear that the enemy has been intercepted and something more than hurried in his retreat.

The news of last night from the Lower Kanawha is that the rebel cavalry, estimated at 400, had temporarily cut the communication with General Scammon. If the telegraph line from Clarksburg to Gauley is working, you will, no doubt, hear from him by that route, as I do not
