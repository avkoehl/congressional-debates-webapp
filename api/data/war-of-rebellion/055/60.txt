[CHAP. XLIII.

CHATTANOOGA, November 18, 1863-3 p.m.

The plan for attacking Bragg's positions is completed and its execution begun by moving Ewing's division, of Sherman's army, from Bridgeport to Trenton, where it should arrive to-day, threatening the enemy by Stevens' Gap. The remainder of that army will move into Lookout Valley by way of Whiteside's, extending its lines up the valley toward Trenton as if to repeat the flanking movement of Rosecrans. Having drawn the enemy's attention to that quarter, Sherman will disappear on Thursday night and encamp his forces behind the ridge of hills north of the Tennessee, opposite to Chattanooga, and keep them there out of sight of the rebels during Friday. On Friday night Engineer Smith will throw a bridge across the river just below the mouth of Chickamauga Creek, so that on Saturday morning Sherman's command may be across before daylight, if possible. With the creek protecting his left flank, he will push for the head of Missionary Ridge. His force will consist of about 15,000 muskets of his own army, Jeff. Davis' division, of the Fourteenth Corps, about 7,000 strong, and the Eleventh Corps, 5,000 strong. At least such is now Grant's intention as regards the composition of Sherman's wing of the attack. At the same time that this wing advances, Granger, with about 18,000 men, will first move up on the left of the Chattanooga lines, throwing two bridges across Citico Creek, and engaging the rebel right with all possible vigor. Hooker, with Geary's division and two brigades of Palmer's division, now stationed at Whiteside's and Shellmound-and to be relieved for this purpose by forces thrown forward by Slocum from the garrisons on the Nashville railroad-will also attack the head of Lookout Mountain to hold the rebel left in its positions, and, if practicable, carry the mountain.

Deserters from the rebels, of whom about 20 come in daily, report they are expecting an attack, but think it will be made directly upon the front of line here.

CHATTANOOGA, November 18, 1863-7.30 p.m.

Ewing's division, moving from Bridgeport by way of Shellmound, Whiteside's, and Murphy's Hollow, reached Trenton about 11 a.m. to-day. No report from Ewing yet received. A scout of Howard's reports that about 12 miles up the valley Ewing was fired at by two guns from Lookout Mountain, ineffectually. General Negley having reported to Thomas for duty from Nashville, Thomas replied that he could not give him a command until a court had cleared him from charges of cowardice and desertion at Chickamauga. Colonel Lagow, additional aide-de-camp, having resigned, Grant would prefer that he should not be dismissed.
