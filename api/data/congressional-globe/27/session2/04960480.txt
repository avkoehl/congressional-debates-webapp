him that two of his letters had been found in the department on
Saturday, and copies of them sent to him

that was, to know how the editor of t e Madisoman obumed

qaPbtion it issue
The pundit prjp"i3ition was to alter the law of the land,

any real ^convenience, an Í no sufiicienf grounds had yet been
ohown í r chars n* it 'it. would a-dc, what practical evil had

of chan3^ ar i it tray well be said that it is better to 'bear
tro«e ills wehav* 'han f vto oil e^ that we knownotof "
Tha sohiaij case to be met is euch as that of McLeod, for
which a special clause is made at th e end of the bill And what •
is the most extraordinary remedy proposed to meet this case?
It is, that the criminal jurisdiction of the States shall be ar-
rested— not after judgment, but befoie proceedings have been
enteied up, trial had, and judgment given All that is requi-
site i* for the accused to plead that his defence rests on the Con-
stitution, on the laws of the United States, or on some treaty
with a foreign power On th's plea, the original jurisdiction
is to be taken from the State, by an interposition of a district
judge, who may set the accused free, on a bearing of the facts
and the law, without the interposition of a jury The power
of the State is palsied at once, and fall  dead at the feet of a
mere district judge on the app ication of the accused
TheC nstuution limits the causes for jurisdiction of the Su-
preme Court to those controlled by the Constitution jtself, by
the laws of Congress, or treaties with foreign powers; hut
this hill goes beyond the Constitution, and superadds two more
cases those arising out of the law of nations, or orders given
by foreign prince41
This case of MtXeod had been an unfortunate one in many
respects It had proved almost a Pandora's box, for, manyas
haj been the evils which flowed from itf the worst was yerto
come in this infraction of State sovereignty, and the |consa-
quenees^which may en ue
In the course of his argument, he meant to prove—
First That if Congress had the constitutional power to make
this kw, it ought not to exercise it
Second  Tnat Congress does not possess the power
Third That the tendency «f the bill is to increase litigation,
increase the expensesof ludicial proceedings, and occasion such
delay and defeat of justice as must prove intolerable
Fourth That a regard for national honor and national char-
acter ought to prevent us adoption at this time
With regard to the first, he contended that Congress could
have no power to confei the right of judicial interference, unless
m an appellate form, as a revision of judgment previously
given by the State tribunal and could confer no power under
the law of nations, or orders of a foreign punce, no such power
being delegated to itself by the Constitution
The first effect of such a law as that proposed would he, to
induce collision between the State Governments and the Fede
ral Government, endangering the peace and harmony of the
whole Union
Mr B here enteied into a minute review of anticipated re.
suits and showed a great variety of cases m which this collision
would be sure to arise The delay of justice, he estimated,
would not fall short of two years He showed that to use the
writ of habeas corpus as proposed in this bill, would he to per-
vert that which was instituted, and hnherto had been uaed, as
the safeguard of hbeity into an instrument for the subversion
of the liberty of sovereign States, and the consolidation of con-
centnted power, inimical to all liberty It would be used as
the means of subverting the trial by jury, guarantied by tKe
Constitution to all persons accused of crimes, asadistnctjndgfe
might set at naught vhe State jurisdiction, (m itself a primary
element of sovereignty,) and acquit the accused upon a hearing
oí the evidence, without the intervention of a jury at all A
little regard was certamlv due to State sovereignty, hut here,
noteven that of wa'ting till the State tribunals have acted, and
entered up judgment, is evinced—a pracuce now proposed to
b" adopted for the first time within the fifty years during
which this Government has existed But, even if it werecon-
stitutional in Congress to pass this bill, it was not  ow recon 
ciiable with national honor and national character to do so
Here Mr B enteied into an animated and graphic r&view
of the Mel eod ca^e, fiom the burning of the Caioiine down to
the pending negotiation between the Cabinet of the present Ad
munstiation and Lord Ashburton, and showed that war ivouid
have been inevitable, had not the Slate of New \ork mam-
tune 1 her sovereign nght>, and tried McLeod ílecoof-end-
ed that every thing that eould be done to appease Great Brit-
ain had been already done by tins Administration, and it was
time now for Great Britain to do something on her part towards
reparation for the mj ury in dieted under her authority It was
not necessary to go furfher than this country had already
gone by passing this bill
After Mr Buchanan had concluded,
Mr CHOATJS obtained the floor, but it was then 3 o'clock,
and he moved that the Senate should go into executive sqs
sion, which was agreed to
Tne Senate accordingly went into executive session, and,
shortly afterwards, adjourned
