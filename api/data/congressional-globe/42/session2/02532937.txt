state of things existed externally which I have
before described.
The annual expenditures of the Government
then were $58,955,829—all that was deemed
necessary then for carryingon the Government.
"But," gentlemen will tell me, "this will
not do for our population now and the
remark is just. It certainly would not be fair
to suppose that this Government could be
carried on in 1872 for the $59,000,000 that it
cost ro carry it on in 1860. For the increase
of population only I have added thirty per
cent,., making $17,686,748. " But this would
not be fair," I should be justly told, "be-
cause our currency is depreciated." 1 add,
therefore, for the depreciation of the currency
ten percent., which has been of late the ruling
difference between currency and gold, and
this makes $7,664,267. " But," you will tell
me, "we had very few pensioners in 1860."
That is true. I recognize your whole pension
list; and for pensions I add $30,480,000.
" But then," it will be said, " we had in 1860
no public debt." I add the whole annnal
interest of the public debt, $105,889,398; and
then I add for the sinking-fund reduction of
which I spoke $18,758,480. These different
items make the whole necessary expenses of
the Government amount to only $239,43 t,892,
tabulated thus:

allowance for increase of population and depreciated

The honorable gentleman from Ohio, in the
sppech to which I have referred, said :
"I know it is not safe to attempt to forecast the
future, butl venture to express the belief that the
year 1876 will witness our ordinary expenditures re-
duced to $125,000,UQO, and the interest on our public
debt to $95,000,000, making our total expenditures
exclusive of payment on the principal of the public
debt, $220,000,000."
My calculation makes the amount $239,000,-
000, $9,000,000 beyond the estimate which
the gentleman from Ohio made in January last,
and which he supposed would be realized not
later than 1876.
I am glad to see that we have arrived at a
period in our history when we can begin to
reduce 
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I am very sorry
to interrupt the gentleman ; but I observe that
he took $30,000,000 as the figures for pen-
sions; and I wish to call his attention to the
fact that last year the payments for pensions
amounted to $34,000,000 ; so that there is a
difference of $4,000,000 in that single item.
Mr. MAYNARD. What is the amount
appropriated for pensions this year?
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. The item this
year is a little more than thirty-four million
dollars.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I have taken
my figures from the report of the Secretary of
the Treasury for the last fiscal year. Our pen-
sions have increased so rapidly that no doubt
the gentleman from Ohio is correct.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. The gentleman
will notice that in my estimate 1 adopted
$34,000,000 as the figures for pensions. The
additional $4,000,000 would make half the
difference of which he speaks.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. As I have
just said, my figures are takeu from the last
annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury
for the fiscal year ending June 30th last.
Mr. MAYNARD. The gentleman will re-
member that last year we pensioned the sol-
diers of the war of 1812.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Our duty is
now to see how to provide for this expenditure
of our Republic ; and one of the best ways to
decide what ought to be doue is to contrast
the revenues of this country with the revenues
of theBritish Government, one of themostex-
travagantand costly Governments m the world,
it is said, though I do not agree in the extrava-
gant remark which is sometimes made upon
this point. The revenue of the United States
from customs during the last fiscal year was
$206,270,000, while the revenue of the British
Government from the same source was less
than one half that amount. I would remind
gentlemen who wish to destroy our internal
revenue system in order to keep up the high
duties upon imports that the annual revenue
of the British Government from customs is
only $101,630,000, less than halt what we
derive from customs duties. The revenue
we receive from all other sources is $177,653,-
000, while the revenue of the British Govern-
ment from all other sources is $271,911,000.
Thus the revenues of the United States Gov
eminent, raised during the last fiscal year by
taxation of our people, amounted to $383,-
323,000, while "the expensive monarchical,
aristocratical Government of Great Biitain"
raised from its people only $373,540,000.
Thus, in a table, contrasted:

Customs $206,270,000 $101,630,000
All other sources  177,053,000 271,911,000
Total $383,323,000 $373,541,000
The taxes of the United States alone upon
the citizens of the United States, excluding
the taxes m the thirty-seven State governments,
were greater last year tban were the taxes
upon British subjects by $9,782,000. Hence,
the chairman of the Committee on Finance in
the Senate said the other day with great force,
(and I call the especial attention of the House
to this announcement, for it is true—too true,)
" These taxes," (said Senator Sherman,)
u these taxes," (the high taxes of the tariff,)
4'are higher than they ever were before in the
history of this country or any other country in
the world."
It must be remembered while I make this
statement that the British debt is greater than
the debt of the United States, upon which
their expenditures are based to raise revenue,
by $1,753,368. The cost of the collection of
their revenue is only $12,890,000 or three and
forty-six hundredths per cent., while the col-
lection of oul* customs is $9,01*2,199, or four
and thirty-seven hundredths per cent., and of
our internal revenue is $5,835,128 or four and
five hundredths per cent., thus making an ag-
gregate cost to us for the collection of our
revenue of $14,847,327.
Now, Mr. Chairman, after consultation with
my associates of the Committee of Ways and
Means, I mean my Democratic associates, I
hold in my hand a programme of what they
think ought to be the amount of revenue to
be raised from the people of the United States
for all the expenditures of this Government.
We have not embodied this in the form of a
bill, because it would not have been in our
power to present a bill in detail that the major-
ity of the House would accept. We have only
presented our ideas of what ought to be the
amount of revenue raised trom the people,
and the articles on which it should be raised,
and we have named here ouiy ad valorems,
though in many cases we should levy specific
duties. These articles are few in number.
The following table in detail will amply show
what revenue we propose to derive therefrom:
