We are not on the defensive except as to our wagons and supplies, and should invite the enemy out. Send word to Stoneman and have him to feel well around Lost Mountain. The enemy has had no signal on it for some days, still I know they are sensitive about that flank. Get all your guns to the front where they can converge on some point of the enemy; knock away the obstructions and make a break. I will try the same at Thomas' front.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,In the Field, Ga., June 16, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: I have pushed in from the west with my left, just crossing the Marietta road, until I confront the enemy's second line, about a mile in advance of that which I gained yesterday; my left is very near the Hardshell Church. The enemy's line runs from that point in a southwesterly direction. I am satisfied the enemy has a third line on the higher ridge in rear. I am putting in batteries and preparing for an attack in the morning. The ground is unfavorable, yet I hope by free use of artillery to get the salient of the enemy's works at Hardshell Church without much loss. I have not heard from Stoneman yet this evening; will send you his report as soon as I receive it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S.- Stoneman has just reported; he drew artillery fire from Lost Mountain and reconnoitered the enemy;s line from the mountain to the right of my infantry; they were everywhere occupied in force. General Stoneman represents the enemy's main line front Lost Mountain as apparently running in rear of that which is now in my immediate front.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General, Commanding.
