But it invests the military authorities with no general and arbitrary control of civil matters. Especially has the officer appointed by you no power or control over the militia, the reoganization of which will take place under the laws and instructions that will shorly be communicated to you. It gives that officer no power to decide upon the right of any person to exemption from military duty, as he seems to have undertaken to do in the case of Mr. C. R. Jones. In accordance with my understanding of the enforcement of martial law and in conformity with the course pursued in this city without objection, you will only require a provost-marshal with the style, power, and duties of such officer, and I desire that the officer appointed by you to enforce the proclamation of the President and the orders issued in pursuance thereof be directed to conform in his style and course of proceeding with the foregoing views. A copy of the opinion of the Attorney-General will be forwarded to you for your guidance.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General, Commanding.
