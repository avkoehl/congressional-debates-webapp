Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

General Peck has ascertained by very authentic testimony that the forces on the Blackwater are from 27,000 to 30,000, corresponding with my statement last evening. A portion has crossed the river and are intrenched on this side. Colonel Spear attacked one of their earthworks yesterday, but did not succeed in carrying it. Our loss is trifling. We captured a lieutenant, and, I understand, a few privates.

FORT MONROE, VA., March 18, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

My men arrived from Richmond late last evening. He was at Staunton on the 7th. General Jones was in command with 35,000 men. Near Culpeper Court-House there were 1,800. He was at Fredericksburg on the 9th. The enemy had one hundred and seven regiments there, making, as he thinks, about 85,000. The regiments have been strengthened lately by conscripts. At Fort Darling there are about 7,000; between Fredericksburg and Richmond about 15,000; below Fredericksburg and on the Blackwater, 28,000. At Richmond there are not over 3,000. Wise, on the left bank of the James River, on the Chickahominy, at White House, and Diascund Bridge, has about 9,000. The enemy with 4,000 men, and is fortifying strongly. This is a part of the 28,000 between Fredericksburg and the Blackwater. All my information confirms the belief that every man capable of bearing arms that could be reached in the insurgent States has been taken up by the conscription act.

Major General AMBROSE E. BURNSIDE:

Received your dispatch of yesterday. Have reported to General Dix. He informs me that Getty's division has been sent to Suffolk. Willcox and Sturgis are still at Newport News. Shall I order Getty and Sturgis? It may cause a little delay to replace Getty at Suffolk by Willcox.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
