Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS, June 30, 1864.

General GRANT:

GENERAL: I have just received an order to return and assist General Sheridan in extricating General Wilson. I have just come from General Meade's headquarters and explained the whole position to him and he is satisfied that all has been done that can be done. My command is in no condition to do anything; the main cause of our rout was the worn-out condition of the men. Men and horses have had nothing to eat forty-eight hours, and they are exhausted from loss of sleep. If Wilson cannot extricate himself we can do nothing more for him. I advised General Meade to send a force down the plank road toward Jerusalem, for when I was cut off from him it was his intention to go back and cross the railroad in the vicinity of Jarratt's Station and the Nottoway at Allen's, Peters', or Jerusalem Bridges. I hope the order will be rescinded. My command has reached Spring Hill and has been halted there.

AUGUST V. KAUTZ.

HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, June 30, 1864-1 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

I have been directed to report to you for orders; my command has gone to Bermuda Hundred, where all their equipage is. I should like to have two or three days to get it organized again and get everything together.

AUGUST V. KAUTZ,Brigadier-General.
