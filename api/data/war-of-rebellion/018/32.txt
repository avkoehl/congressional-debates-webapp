Secretary of War:

Dispatch received. I extract from the suggestions submitted by me to the Secretary on the 19th instant paragraph Numbers 4, as follows:

Assuming that it is the desire of the Government that the first object of the commanding general shall be to take possession of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, and either hold the same and employ it in transportation of our own troops and stores or prevent its use by the enemy, the corps d'armee should march through the open land of Kentucky and East Tennessee directly upon Cumberland Gap or Knoxville, and so turn the position which the enemy may have assumed or determined upon in the mountains or defiles of the Alleghanies.
