CITY POINT, July 1, 1864.

General S. WILLIAMS:

Lieutenant Colonel J. B. Howard, chief quartermaster Cavalry Corps, is here. He states that there was an abundance of hay and grain at Wind-Mill Point when the Cavalry Corps left that place, but that the movement was so hurried it was not taken. He says that one division did leave with two days', but the other none. I can discover no failure or neglect in my department. Colonel Howard has a train now ready to start for Sheridan's command with two days' forage and three of subsistence. He has but just learned where to send the train.

RUFUS INGALLS,

Chief Quartermaster.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Two deserters came into the lines of the Third Division, Fifth Corps, last night at 10.30. They are from the Twenty-second North Carolina, Scales' brigade, Wilcox's division. They state that they had been out only a few hours on post before they came in; that they heard their captain say that the brigade would move down to the Weldon railroad at 2 o'clock this a.m.; that they know of no troops to replace it in line where it lay, but that a skirmish line would be left in front of it. They are conscript deserters and have been in the army but ten days. They know little or nothing of the position of their army, except that Longstreet is on their left; that A. P. Hill's corps extends to the railroad, which they think is about a mile distant. It is rumored that their railroads are all cut, but that they have two months' supply in Richmond.

Very respectfully,

GEORGE H. SHARPE,

Colonel, &amp;c.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Three deserters from the Forty-eight Mississippi Regiment, of Harris' brigade, Anderson's old division, came into General Birney's front about 7 o'clock this morning. They state that their brigade is on the right of their division, and their line extends nearly to the lead-works on the Weldon railroad. Kirkland's brigade, of Heth's division, lies next on their right. One of the most intelligent of these informants thinks that their line of battle turns at the lead-works, and extends some distance in a southerly direction along the Weldon railroad. He thinks McLaws' division, of Longstreet's corps, is on this part of the line along the railroad. The two brigades, Finegan's and Perrin's (old), that went to Reams' Station a few days since
