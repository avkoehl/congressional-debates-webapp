When the VICE PRESIDENT announced
the result of the balloting for the Committee on
Manufactures,
Mr. CLAY rose, and said, the balloting Was a
very fatiguing process, and he presumed no one
, felt it more so than the Presiding Officer. Al-
though a necessary, it was nevertheless a Very
tedious process, and would probably occupy the
Senate till four o'clock before they got through.
As the Senate would not have a great deal to do
to-morrow, he would therefore wove to adjourn;
which was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned.

District of Columbia, and moved that it be re-
ferred to the Committee on the District of Co-
lumbia,                                                                i

So the memorial was laid on the table.
Mr- SLADE said he had asked for the print-
ing of the memorial, because he was sure that
very many gentlemen who had voted to lay it on
i the table were favorably inclined in regard to the
1 subject it prayed for, and were not, perhaps, dis-
, tinctly aware of its object.   It was well known
, that memorials of -the same character had been
presented tp Congress for along time.   The sub-
, ject was one confessedly of great importance, of
great n&tioiaal 'importance, and, one in regard to
I which, whatever might be the feelings, or what-
ever might be the prejudices of gentlemen, they
ought to desire to be informed, and to act under-
standingly.   He thought, therefore, in reference
to the importance of the question, the memorial
should be printed; and he also thought so in xd-
I erence to what he understood to be the character
of the memorialists theraselvo ,   He was not ac-
qujiinted with them personally, but he knew them
to belong to a portion of country as much enlight-
ened and as well informed in regard to the char-
acter of human rights, and the extent of rights
which belong to the freemen of this country, and
Ihe several States, as any portion of the commu-
nity. They were people who as well understood
their coBStiWtional  rights as any other, if they
were of the. same stamp as those from whom he
would have to present, similar memorials.    He
knew the personal ehar-acters and respectability
of those people; and when they presented their
memorial to this Hqase they wore entitled, as a
matter «f cenwnoo «ourtesy, to a respectful hear-
ing; and, he would add, as a matter of common
right and common courtesy, that their memorials
should be printed for the information of the mem-
bers of the House.   He further begged permis-
sion to say, that there was less connection between
these memorials for the abolition of slavery in
the District of Columbia, and the general efforts
making at this time to press upon the South the
importance of immediate abolition, than was gen-
erally imagined.   He knew the former petitions
to be signed by a great number of gentlemen of
the highest respectability, who did not belong to
the Abolition Society, who never did belong, and
who probably never would belong to thai society
