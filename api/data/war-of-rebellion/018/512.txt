NEAR WARRENTON, VA., July 27, 1862.

Major-General McDOWELL:

Your dispatch just received. We have had reports for ten days past that Jackson was at Louisa Court-House with a large force and Ewell at Gordonsville. General Hatch, who returned last night from an expedition to Stanardsville, thinks there are not less than 4,000 cavalry at Gordonsville; this from reports of the people and contrabands. General Crawford reports this morning from Culpeper that a scout was sent to Barnett's Ford, on the Rapidan, yesterday. He drove in the pickets and pursued them for 1 mile, capturing a train with eight barrels of flour, which was destroyed. He reports the advance from Fredericksburg 4 miles from Orange Court-House, with two brigades of infantry and 1,500 cavalry.

Richmond papers, July 24, 25, captured from people within 2 miles of Orange Court-House, state that General Johnston is recovered and Tatnall acquitted.

A scout to Somerville Ford went 1 1/2 miles beyond without seeing enemy. General Hatch believes if enemy moves upon us it will be by a cavalry raid. This is quite probable. General Crawford reports a signal-gun cannon fired at midnight in the direction of the Rapidan, and that his command was under arms during last night. No explanation of the signal gun has yet been received.

Major-General McDOWELL:

Nothing new had occurred at Culpeper at 12 m. Enemy believed to be in force at Liberty Mills, between Orange Court-House and Gordonsville. Secession people talked of our concentrating large force and attacking them.

Rapidan closely watched and enemy's pickets frequently driven in by our troops.

MY DEAR SIR: * Your dispatch of this morning was received. General Hatch reported in person last night. He failed, he says, to execute his orders, from the utter breaking up of his horses, the state of the roads, and the storms. He went no farther than Stanardsville, south from there to Rockingham and Luray back. He has been much disappointed, I judge, by the result.

General McDowell telegraphs me that his force from Fredericksburg on its return from Orange was pursued 8 miles by the enemy. His rear guard beat them back, whenever they came up, with loss. None of our men were injured. The officer reports that his force went within 1 mile of Orange Court-House by sunrise 26th instant. Learned on pretty good authority that Robinson (should be Robertson, successor to
