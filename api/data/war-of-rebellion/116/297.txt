Major-General HALLECK:

The troops from here are ordered into the field and there is not usfficient guard for prisoners of war arriving to prevent escape, owing to extent of camp to guard. Prisoners are being made comfortable in barracks, but they arrive in much confusion-parts of regiments and companies together-and many thinly clothedand some sick and no surgeons with them. The guard accompanying he prisoners are ordered to return immediately. They are from the Fifty-second Illinois and Twentieth Ohio. A temporary force can be raised here sufficient for guard if you direct, and the guard who accompanied them remain until it is organized.

Colonel, Commanding.

I noticed last night the guard for prisoners who passed through here to Chicago was insufficient and telegraphed to Chicago a strong guard to be furnished and have no d9ubt it was done. Have nothing but an arsenal guard here, but 400 of Colonel Voss' cavalry will be here to-morrow. If prisoners are sent here to-day let me have time to raise a citizen guard.
