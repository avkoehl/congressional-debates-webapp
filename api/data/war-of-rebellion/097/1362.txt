HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,March 28, 1865.

Lieutenant-General EARLY:

Dispatch of 27th received. Enemy's strength cannot be as large as reported. I would repress extravagant rumors. I regret paucity of your troops. Get them together and use them to best advantage. Great circumspection is necessary. Martin is directed to co-operate with you. McLaughlin's battalion will be ordered here. Sheridan has reached Grant's left. He may attempt to go to Lynchburg from this side.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR,

Richmond:

The enemy crossed Hatcher's Run this morning at Monk's Neck Bridge with a large force of cavalry, infantry, and artillery, and to-night his left extended to Dinwiddie Court-House. Gregg's cavalry advanced a mile and a half on Ford's road toward the South Side Railroad. General Anderson moved out from his position and struck his column near the intersection of the Quaker road and Boydton plank road, but did not succeed in driving him back.
