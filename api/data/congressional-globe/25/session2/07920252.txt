2Sth Cong-.- 2nd St,bS.______________Making public officers depositaries—Mr. jillen.                                                          Senate.
ment is, in its social structure, necessarily too
feeble, and exerts too little control over :he citizen
and his property, to protect him against a powet
holding in its own hands the value of his labor, and
the measure of his subsistence, for, after all, man
must, m the nature of thing*, ultimately yield to
that power winch bears most directly and steadily
upon him The necessities of life leave him no
means of resisting a power that determines, at
pleasure, the quantity of his daily biead
And now, I ask, what monarch, w hat Go\ ernment,
in any ago or country, ever possessed a powei ora
the labor, the property, the subsistence ol the peo-
ple, over their domestic comk m, their social hap
piness, so arbitrary, so niesponsible, so omnipo-
tent, as that which the baaks of this tree country
now hold over this free people? But are we Iree,
can we feel that we are fieemen, whilst theie
exists in our midst a despotism of chartered compa-
nies, changing our social condition from day today,
at its own pleasure, for its own benefit'
Sir, one ol the e sential elements of freedom is
the security for the future which we have in the
present Your paper system deranges the whole
community by a single act It throws out a hun-
dred millions of loans to-day, it withdraws them to-
morrow, anda revolution m propeitj is accom-
plished The honest citizen retnes at n ght with
the accumulated proceeds ot his toil aioundhim,
he rises at morn m banki uptcy and despair The
bank  haves reduced the circle of then lavors, and
his property has been sacrmced upon the scale oí
depreciation caused by the curtailment The third
da) comes, and he is once more stimulated info
life and hope by the returning tide of bank licili-
lies the fouith day he is replunged into beggary by
bank ccnliictions Thus, by thtse alternations,
the cheerful prospect ol improvin¿ his condition by
regular labor is blasted for ever lie is left to beat
about in the feveush void between the extremes of
hope and despondency And, sir, that iestless nn-
tation of the pubhe mind which is hourl) putting
at hazard the repose and the netilrilily oí ihe coun-
try, is among the natural effects ol these suddui
* and frequent transitions in the circumstances and
-fortunes of men

ment their number Eich is a monopoly as against

the Un led States is the centre of the sj stem be
cause that is the membei mwhichth greatest pow
er is accumulated, and which stands in the region
where the payments of the continent are made 1o
this institution, therefore, all the parts of the sys-
tem are attracted by a gravitation as infallible as
that which draws the w iters of the West to the
GuTf of Mexico, or holds this Capitol to the earth
By dispe iswg its influence throughout all the chan-
nels of pohtieal power, and re-acting steadily upon
the legislation of the country, the system hav, with-
in less than the half of a century, strengthened its
grasp, and enlarged its orbit, till it now compre-
hends eight hundred banks, with a capital of three
hundred millions, a circulation of a hundred and
twenty millions, and a mass of loans amounting to
near five hundred millions of dollars. This fright-
ful power is concentrated, nominally, in the hands
of about ten thousand officers oí banks, but really
m those of a single man, who, as president of the
central member, controls, by his sol tary will, the
whole machmeiy of the sjstem
But in what manner his the >>) stem thus re-act-
ed upon legislation, the soutce of its existence?
Whit human agency has it employed thus to en-
large and perpetuate itsell, and what is the extent
of that agency? In reply to these questions, ten
thousand bank presidents, directors, cashiers, clerks,
counsellor, and attoinejs, ¡tiand forth to our view
They aie followed by an army of at leastseventv-
five thousand stockholders, whose íear is covered
by a train of dependant  indefinitely long But if
these liumbeis of men ire great, w hit shall we say
when we see still advancing the multitudinous host
ol bonowets, with their dependints, and all these
to be succeeded b> a swarm ot impatient expec-
tants? When the banks suspended payment, their
loan*, and eiiscounts vergeel close upon the sum of
five Initiated mülmiv, of dollms This amount, tí
loaned for a single )eai, m the proportion of one
thousantl dollars to a man, woulet einbraceyiue hun-
ihcd thousand men, if loaneel, in the same propor-
tion, í i six months, it would reach one im/¡to  of
men, and if loaned for the usual penod of ninety
days, then the bank borrowers, in ,i single year,
would number two ?iuifto 4 of uikvuliiah—a num-
ber far tianscendmg the enine voting population oí
ihe Union But these institution distribute not their
fivois so equall) is this If, however, the) do not
bung the influence of then loans to be u directly on
all this multitude, they a lvalue far towards effecting
thalobject, meliieclly by applying their money only
to those who, from their influence m socie ty, can
control most ol the icsi
And now, I ask, who aie the men that compose
this ama/ing conoouise ol bankeis, st< ckhokleis,
bonowers and di pendantst Where are they to be
found'' Au the) among the humble citizens,
el omcl, bv Ihe necessities of life, to toil in obscu-
ii \' Are ih'y to be found m the field oí m the
woikshop'' No, sir, n they an to be found in the
shade c t summer and in the sunshine of winter,
tl ey aie to lie found amidst ih s loiest of banks that
everhadow the cities, towns, an 1 villiges, of the
Republic There ih y uc and llietc, at this very
moment the\ mav befennd, eieuohing in servile
subini sion to the c in unit on —delen ling their
fi in Is, the m st tupe nel ins lb it e vet were com-
mitted—deleiiding their open rebellion agnnst pub-
lic lis, mil leviling the Government of their
country, and the fntnds of that Government, with
ill the bitterness 11 meieen ymiliu f irm, sir,
must le the he tit of th it m m «ml strong must be
In ne rve, \ h In le> c >mpl un of the oppression
el the banks—who dare. t> lilt the voice of pa-
triotic warning to his eoiihliynu n Stern must bo
his ssul, an 1 n d< until le his loititude, before he
pvesumes tj rebuk Ihe power it the banks—a
power which has Un U) coiled around the sacred
iorms ef the Constituí on which is day by day
increasing ihe mlcn<-it) ol its pKssuie, and stran-
gling public libeity m its fold
I ask, again, who aie these men, and where to
be found' True it h ihu many ol them are citi-
zens geiod «id valuable—but true it is, also, that
they ire, in the general, men who live by elevices,
by traffic and speculation They ate congrégatele
in towns, and cines, whtie banks dispense their fa-
\ ors, mil whi re they Ci mbine to defend all the in-
justice if the dispensing pow er Thus, each one
of these delinquent corporations stanels securely
in the mielst of a faithful garuson Let an in-
jured citizen utter a word in complaint of his
wiongs, and in a moment he is denounced, his
charactei assailed, and his influence impaired or
destroyed Let a pubhc journal print but an un-
friend!) line, subscriptions to the paper are imme-
diately withdrawn, advertisements discontinued,
and the affrighted printer persecuted into submis-
ison or beggary      Thus, that loud sentinel, the
Press, intendad as it was to sound the alarm on the
first approach of danger, is subsidized by favors,
or silenced by intimidation. If it speak at all, it
must speak only in praises t > the banks and in
treachery to the people.
Among this crowd of clamorous dependants are
found a thousand bank attorneys—men.whose pro-
fessional connections with the community, whose
habits ot public speaking, give them a dispropor-
tionate influence over the pubhc mind They,
one and all, stand forth, m aid of subsidized presses,
to justify whatever enormities these corporations
may commit against the people, and to ascribe all
the crimes of banks to the Government of their
country.
It is thus that the powerful influences winch
contribute to mould and direct the passions and
opinions of towns and cities, are arrayed on the
side ol the banking system, and it is thus, also,
that towns and cities, through the intercourse oi
business and the agency of the press, contribute so
powerfully to mould and direct the passions and
opinions of the whole country
Is it, then, wonderful, that a system which has
prostituted and purchased into its service 40 much
of the intellect, which has combined in its sup-
poit so many of the active elements, of society,
should have assumed a despotism, almost absolute,
over the public judgment, and laid the country un-
der tribute, even with the country's consent?
And yet, sir, notwithstanding all this, the control
of banks over property, over labor, over the very
subsistenee of the people, notwithstanding their do-
mination over such a multitude of men, whilst
powei yet abides in the mass, there Would still be
hope for public liberty, if that powei remained un-
corrupteei when delegated to public agents, for this
is the point where the attack is most direct and fa-
tal The representative principle is the vitality of
the Government, and its couuption puts an end to
civil liberty Aie we, then, exposed to danger in
this direction? Has bank influence reached the
public functionaries? Has it contaminated power
111 then hinds, bent them from the line of duty'
And have they rewarded the generous confidence
ot the people with treachery to their dearest inte
rests? I ask these questions, and now, sir, who
stands ready with a negative answei? Will it, can
it, be denied, that Ihe banking system has, from its
vciy beginning, enlarged and perpetuated itself by
re-acl tng constantly upon the legislation of the coun-
try? Look throughout the Union, with what assi-
duity bank presidents, stockholders, lawyers, bor-
rowers and dependants, are pressed upon the pub-
lic favoi as candidates for all offices, legislative,
executive, and judicial And what, sir, has been
the result'' How many of these men, thus control-
ling banks, or controlled by them, thus directly in-
terested in, or peisonally dependent upon them—
how many are seen in the Legislature of every
Stale? Who will siv that these men, mter&sted as
they are m bank profits igainstthe peeiple who pay
them, do not constitute at least one third, and often
a half, of ever) legislative bol)? Who will deny
that these legislators, faithless to the sacied trusts
confided to them regatdless of the public welfare,
and mindful only of their own mteres's, have ever
combined, and still do combine, to multiply the
privileges, to dimmish the responsibilities, and to
increase the profits of the banks?
The fundamental laws of the Union, and of the
States, have sought to guatd public men against
temptation and imputity, and thus tosecure fidelity
to the people, by express provisions In most, if
not all, of the States, men are ineligible to offices cre-
ated by their own agency, as members of the Le-
gislature, and the officers of the General Govern-
ment, one and all, aie disqualified to sit in the le-
gislative bodits ol the States And jet, in a coun-
try so jealous, so vigilent of its freedom, what u>
the practice universally prevalent, where banks
are concerned'' Do we not see members of the
Legislature, who are already interested in or de-
pendent upon banks already established, conspiring
among themselves, as well as with others, to char-
ter new institutions, to incorporate themselves by
name, and thus to levy money, for their own use,
by their own acts, upon their own constituents'
But is this all?   Are the corrupting influences of
