Major-General VAN DORN, Holly Springs, Miss.:

I did not mean Pemberton would not command, but that you would not be deprived of your division nor Price of his by the order issued here. How did Lovell get your corps? Why will you have no command? I think to remove you now would be injurious to you. To what other field would be transferred? Will write by Captain Schaumburg.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
