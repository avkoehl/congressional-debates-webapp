This la t line of the paragraph developes this
whole singular «ysiem of financial policy of the
S-cretary, and what is it? Pail to apply money
awua'ly in the Treasury to the payment of its lia-

people, by mcrea ed taxat on, an annual sum va-
rying ''tornsix to eight millions of dollars, and all
tlushr what'' That Congress may dispose of the
proceeds of the public landi as it 'hall think fit, that
Congress may give away one permanent and pro-
ductive source of the public revenue, tax ihe peo-
ple from six 10 eight millions per annum more
than they are now taxed, that Congress maj distr-
bute to their Sta'e Governments less than half the
amount, three millions per annum; the Secretary's
estimate of the proceeds of the public lands This
is the new system of finance put forth to the coun-
try in this report.

OP SOI Til CAROI I\A
In Senate, Monday, June 21, 1841—On the motion
of Mr. Clay oí Kentucky to print 1 500 copies
of tlw report ol the Secretary ot the Treasury on
ihe finances
Mr CALHOUN said, that it was impossible for
any one to read th* report of the Spcretary, with-
out bei.ig struck with the solicitude apparent
thioughout, to make out a large deficit in the re
venue of the year. So great was his solicitude,
that it betrayed him into numerous errors, which
have been su fully exposed by the two Senators
who procc ied me on the same side, that 1 do not
joJ called on to add a word 0 what they have oaid
in h-n rcpec* What I propose, in connection with
wha1 may be palled the financial part oí the re-
pct, 1 to i-how b> a brief and condensed state-
ment, what v ould be ihe defic t at the end of the
year, according 10 tne data iurmsbed by the Secre
tsry hu self, cilNUect from different por'ions of his
report, but all from humelf, iviihout adding an es-
