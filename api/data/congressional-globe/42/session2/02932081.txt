can suspend the rules, and therefore no pos-
sible hardship can result in that way.
Mr. RANDALL. I desire to apprise the
House of a difficulty that will result from giving
this power to the committee. We will prac-
tically be putting a lock upon our mouths and
giving the key to the Committee on the Judi-
ciary, thereby preventing us from the possi-
bility of removing the disabilities of a single
individual without the consent of that com-
mittee. As suggested by the gentleman from
Wisconsin, [Mr. Eldredge,] the resolution of
the House now provides that the committee
shall report but a single amnesty bill.
Mr. ELDREDGE. Under this power.
Mr. RANDALL. We have twice passed a
general amnesty bill and sent it to the Senate.
The SPEAKER. The Chair does not un-
derstand that this proposition refers to general
amnesty billa, but to bills containing particular
names.
Mr. ELDREDGE. It refers to the bill
which the Judiciary Committee is authorized
to report under the resolution already adopted.
Mr. RANDALL. What is the necessity,
then, of further instruction?
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. Because
we have not authority to report at any time.
The SPEAKER. This question merely
relates to the right of the committee to report
at any time. The Judiciary Committee can-
not at present report without unanimous con-
sent, except under the regular call.
Mr. RANDALL. But in agreeing to that,
according to the interpretation which the
Speaker puts upon the action of the House,
we deny ourselves the right of suspending the
rules oil Monday to pass bills relieving any
individuals besides those that may be named
in the bill of the committee.
Several Members. Oh, no.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. Cannot
the bill which we may report be amended in
the House by adding any name?
Mr. RANDALL. Perhaps it might, but on
the other hand you might call the previous
question and prevent amendments.
Mr. AVEltlLL. 1 object to any further
conversation of this kind.
Mr. KING. I presume that this understand-
ing will not cut off the right to introduce here
bills for the relief of particular individuals ; it
merely provides that the committee may report
upon those bills afier they have been referred.
The SPEAKER. The bill, when reported
by the committee, will be amendable by a ma-
jority vote ; the only two-thirds vote required
will be upon the final passage of the bill. So
that any particular name could be incorporated
by a majority vote.
Mr. COX. Will the House hear me one
moment as to a resolution bearing on this
subject, which I desire to send to the Com-
mittee on the Rules ?
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Min-
nesota [Mr. Averill] objects to further dis-
cussion. If the gentleman from Massachu-
setts [Mr. Botler] will now frame his motion
in regard to this matter, the Chair will be very
glad to submit it.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I ask
unanimous consent that the Committee on the
Judiciary may have leave to report at any
time a bill for the removal ot disabilities
imposed on any persons by the fourteenth
amendment.
Mr. KING. Does that mean that all the
names shall be reported in one bill?
The SPEAKER. The proposition is a very
simple one.
Mr. ELDREDGE. I think the proposi-
tion of the gentleman from Massachusetts is
right enough.
Mr. WOOD. I wish to say that in my judg-
ment it would be unfortunate if the friends of
amnesty should embarrass this question by
objecting to the very fair proposition of the
gentleman from Massachusetts.
The SPEAKER. Is there any objection to
42d Cong. 2d Sess.â€”No. 131.
the proposition of the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts that the Committee on the Judiciary
may have leave to report at any time a bill
removing the political disabilities of any num-
ber of persons whom they may choose to in-
clude, and that the bill so reported shall be
in order for consideration at any time ? The
Chair hears no objection, and it is so ordered.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I move the
House proceed to business on the Speaker's
table.
Mr. MAYNARD. I believe my motion to
adjourn is pending.
The SPEAKER. If the House should now
adjourn, the motion of the gentleman from
Minnesota [Mr. Averill] will be the first
business in order after the morning hour of
Monday next.
The motion of Mr. Maynard was agreed
to; and accordingly (at four o'clock and
thirty minutes p. m.) the House adjourned.
