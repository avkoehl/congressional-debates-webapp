DOVER, DEL., January 1, 1861.

SIR: I have the honor to transmit to you the accompanying papers,* including a commission from the Governor of the State of Alabama, appointing the undersigned commissioner to the sovereign State of Delaware "to advise and consult with His Excellency Governor William Burton and the members of the Legislature or State convention, as the case may be, of said State, as to what is best to be done to protect the rights, interests, and honor of the slave-holding States.

Its animus, its single bond of union, is hostility to the institution of slavery as it exists in the Southern States. Its members, numbering nearly two millions of voters, as evidenced by the late Presidential election, have been collected from all the other various political organizations, and although disagreeing totally upon other important political principles, have nevertheless ignored all these, and been molded into a compact mass of enmity to this particular institution, upon which depend the domestic, social, and political interests of fifteen States of the Union, and which institution was recognized, respected, guarded, and protected of the States by whom it was ordained and established.

The slave-holding States, notwithstanding the vastness of their interests at stake, will be either unrepresented in the Cabinet councils of the incoming Administration or represented by men who sympathize with this party in its purpose. The same policy will be
