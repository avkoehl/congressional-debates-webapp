Have examined the ground immediately around the depot. It will require a regiment to defend the place. Shall I telegraphed to Nashville for tools to construct the intrenchments? General Wood informs me he has but very few intrenching tools.

Major-General BUELL, Huntsville, Ala.:

Two discharged rebel soldiers reached this place to-day direct from Richmond via Chattanooga. They report the rebels leaving Chattanooga in large numbers on the Tennessee Railroad. They understood that they were assembling at Cleveland. The report corresponds with information gained by General Schoepf, who was informed also that the enemy had put three regiments across the river at Chattanooga, but withdrew them as soon as they commenced to move on the railroad. These men report that they crossed at Chattanooga in the night and came to Cowan through the mountains, but saw no parties of the enemy on this side of the river.
