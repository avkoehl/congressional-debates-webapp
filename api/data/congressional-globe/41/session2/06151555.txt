DIVISION OF TEXAS.
Mr. HOWARD asked, and by unanimous
consent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S.
No. 593) to divide the State of Texas, and to
establish the Territories of Jefferson and Mat-
agorda ; which was read twice by its title.
Mr. HOWARD. I ask the indulgence of the
Senate for a moment while I state very briefly
the boundaries of the several divisions pro-
posed. The bill which I have just introduced
divides the State of Texas into three parts. The
eastern portion of it, which in tbe bill is denom-
inated the Territory of Jefferson, lies to the
eastward of the river San Antonio and the
Trinity river, and contained, according to the
census of 1860, about two hundred and thirty
thousand inhabitants. West of this Territory
of Jefferson, and between San Antonio river
and Trinity river and the Colorado river of
Texas, lies what the bill denominates the State
of Texas. That portion, by the census of 1800,
contained about two hundred and fifty thou-
sand inhabitants, black and white. All to the
westward of the western boundary line of the
contemplated State of Texas is to be denom-
inated by the bill the Territory of Matagorda,
and embraces, according to the same census,
about one hundred and fifteen or one hundred
and eighteen thousand inhabitants.
It has occurred to me that the State of Texas
is so large and so unwieldy as to make it neces-
sary to divide it into two or three or even four
different parcels for the purposes of govern-
ment. At present the territory is so extensive,
I may say the people within its limits are of
such a peculiar character, that I should despair
hereafter of seeing a State government estab-
lished in that State, as now organized, that
will be competent to the protection of life and
property and all the other interests which per-
tain to a civilized, regular government.
Now is the time for ns to act upon this sub-
ject, in my judgment, if we ever act upon it.
Under the joint resolution of 1845 Congress
has power to establish four additional States
within the limits of the State of Texas. The
bill which I have introduced will constitute for
the present only one State, tbe central portion
of Texas, and two Territories. These Terri-
tories ultimately will be of course admitted as
States into equal representation in Congress
as 8uch. I merely make this statement for tho
present to explain the bill. I move that it be
referred to the Committee on Territories and
printed.
Mr. STEWART. I rise to inquire of the
Senator from Michigan what disposition he
proposes to make of the lands that formerly
belonged to the State of Texas, which corpor-
ation was dissolved ?
Mr. HOWARD. I do not know that that
is a question of very great interest now; but
I will simply say to the Senator from Nevada
that the public lands belonging to the pres-
ent State of Texas, falling within the litnits of
these Territories respectively, are to be given
to these Territories, sobject to the payment of
any debts that Texas may owe at present, and
to any futtire arrangement between the Terri-
tories and the State in reference to that debt.
Mr. STEWART. Is there a provision for
administering the lands so as to provide for
their settlement while they remain Territories?
Mr. HOWARD. There is nothing of that
sort in the bill. That is a matter for their own
legislation, or perhaps future legislation on the
part of Congress. I believe, however, that
there are no United States lands within tbe
limits of Texas.
Mr. STEWART. But it may be necessary
to provide for settlers going there.
Mr. HOWARD. That will have to be left
to the local governments.
Mr. STEWART. I make the suggestion
because I think there is very grave doubt
whether we ought to rehabilitate Texas with
that original grant of lands. The States have
generally had very poor land policies, and inas-
much as Texas, after having had her debts pakl
