Making public officers depositaries—Mr. Mien.
Senate.*
the Bank of the United States, struggling for a
renewal oí its chartei, distributed hi loans, one
million six hundred and five thousand seven hun-
dred and eighty-one dollars, to two hundred and
sixty-five members of Congress. This enormous
sum, greater than the aggregate salaries of all the
members of both Houses of Congress during the
same period of five years—a sum equal to one-
fifteenth part of the whole <innual revenues and
expenditures of the Federal Government—this sum
was thus bestowed, as accommodations, by the
banlr, at a time of pretended pressure, upon the
very men of whom it was asking acharter—a char-
ter, which, if granted, would enable the bamc to
levy millions in tribute, year after year, upon their
constituents
Si-, these things may have al1 been innocent It
may be that the additional half million of dollars
thrown, as facilities, into the two Houses of Con-
gress by the bank, in 1832—the very time when its
recharter was pending and pa sed—it may he that
ihe large amount, still in addition, thrown in whilst
the question of restating the deposits w is pending,
in 1834—it may be, that these great and well-timed
favors, bestowed by the bank upon men whilst
sitting in judgment upon its life and its claim to the
public revenue—it may he, that these things had no
other effect than to mal e ihe íeciptent memoirs
better patriots, more devoted to the public ínleiesls,
less intent upon their own, and moie impaittal ac-
tors in the contest belw een the people and the bank
These loans may have been harmless, these men
uncorrupted I know not one, by name, who x>-
ccived these monejs, for then names are supposed
in the report of the committee I speak not, theie
fore, to criminate or wound the feelings of any out
But, sir, I know the nature of man, 1 know that
coming to Congies  changes hira not for the better,
I know that gratitude for favors is a punciple of
that nature, I know thit obligations are thusciea-
ted which thehuman heart is bound to acknowledge,
and the human mind finds it hard to disobey These
things I know, and I know, too, that public liberty
can never be safe whilst public men are exposed to
such temptations It is for these reasons, sir, that
I stand up this da), not only as an Ametican Sena,
tor, but m the still prouder altitude of an Amencan
citizen, to warn my countrymen of a c'angci wtu< h
I most solemnly believe now threatens the punu
and safety ot their Government
But, sir, is this all' Were there id ot ter influ-
ences but the facilities of that bank exeited upon
the membersof Gongiessduung the conlesfi Wert
there no other r< lations subsisting between the
members and the bank, but those of borrower and
lender'' How many oí its. lawyers and stockhold-
ers occupied seats in this Capitoli How many
men sat here who were Ihe lawyers, stockholders,
and borrowers of the numerous local banks winch
had petitioned for the recharter of the Bank of the
United States, because interested as part of the
same system' How many such men weie to be
found in the several legislatures, bending the influ-
ence of whole States to bear upon this cardinal ob-
ject' And now, sir I put the question, if that in-
stitution, alone, hid, pending the struggle, such a
number of its attorneys, stockholders, and bonow-
ess, in the two Houses of Congress, how many ot
such agents aid dependants may this, with its
league of eight hundred local banks, be supposed
now to have under this roof—now, when all these
corporations are making a united eflbi t to grasp
the public revenues'1            *
Sir, I again say, that memtei-s standing in such
relations to the banks, ev en at a time like this, may
still be innocent, they may be uninfluenced In
bank emoluments in deciding the question of re-
warding banks with the profitable use of the public
money All this is possible, but " lead us net into
temptation" i>, nevertheless, a pan of that prajei
which is the inheritance of our ract
If, in the administration of justice, the slightest
interest in the lesult disqualifies men to testily i r
sit in judgment, if the parties litigant are forbidden
even to speak in private to a juror, what would be
thought of that judge or juryman, who, pending a
trial for lif , character, or property, should ask and
obtain, from one of the parties, the pnvate favor ui
an enormous loan?   Or if the partner or attorney
of one of the litigants wete found upon the bench,
oi in the array of the jury, would not such offend-
ing judge or juryman mem and deserve as well the
public odium as the penalties of public justice'*
And if, su, such secuuties are necessary^to the
honest administration of lav/, sue they not still
more so to guard the purity of the law making
power?
Sir, members of legislative bodies should be the
last men m this nation to fotm private connections,
or contract obligations, with banks, because they
are the men of whom these institutions aie constant-
ly asking public favor  If, however, they will do
so, regardless of the indelicicy of incurring Mich
obligations, they have no right to evade detection,
or to complain oí exposure For what is the course
which they pui sue.towards other citizens less exposed
to corruption, and fully as likely as themselves to te-
sist it? What do we heai, in both House  ol Con-
gress, from day to day, through erery session? Do
we not hear all officers of Government itidiscumi-
natelj denounced—denounced as dishonest parti-
sans, corrupted by salaries for which their whole
time and labor aie bestowed in the public seivice?
More than eleven thousand citizens ate employed
as postmasters, and although a large, íl not an
equal, proportion, ot the numbei, nie known to be
hostile to the pain in powti, vet we hue beard
them, une and-ill, pioilanned tole nnpimoipled
wretches, piostimtcd inte ti c s rvicc and support of
a ci nupt administration And now, sn, who aie
these officers, and what is th- amount ol those
-alines wiih which the) aie thus cotuiptecl?
.Nine-tenths, at least, ol the entire numbei,
aie faitriers residing at cross loads, or me-
chitues, or inconsiderable meichinis, in the
little villages, where they are induced to aeecpt of
the offices solely for the aceommod Uion of the citi-
zens in the neighbni hood Foi, in most of these
eases the whole salan received by the officii falls
short ol twenty do'lars a yen Huí in thiscileu-
latinn I will leave nothing to conj cttire I will
spe«il> from the fae Is and the firures, is found upon
the records of the Post Oflic e Depart me nl What,
then, is the result?
On tht first da) of Jul), 18.17, lime were, in all,
eleven thousand seven hundied and seventy post-
in istirs and the aggregite salar es pail to the
whole, dining the preceding )ear, amounted to
c lght hundred and mm tj-om Hi insane! tlnee hun-
died and forty-thif< dolíais Thus, the aggregate
amount divided ly the numb r ol officers, will
show the average annual  iluy of each to have
been but seventy five dollars uid ^evenly-ihree
cents 4nel yet, sn, these humh>e citizens, who
thus give their services to the pub i< lor a compen-
sation so trivial as this, are denounced in iheir ab-
sence, denounced in the councils of their countrj,
denounced with bitterness and lerocity, as basely
prostituted by such salaries as these, and lliat, to >,
by members of Congress who are themselves ie-
ceivtng, for less than hall of their time, an verase
of filtren hundred doll irs atinmiiv ol the public
money Yes, this is done, these denunci itions are
poured forth by 'he very n< mbers who, not eontent
w th the ample amount* di aw n by themselves fiem
the public lieasury, are daily asking, and daily re
reiving, thcusamls on thousands in loans liom
banks, whilst they stand in then places, voting m
return to these corporitions the custody and the
use of the whole re\ emits c f die u eounti) It is in
v un, sir, for men who «ounjustU , sc ciuell) revile
others for such causes as these, lo txptct to elude
sjspiciun, whiUt exposed themselves to temptations
so much moie powerfjl No the American people
will judge, they hive a right, it is their duty to
judge, between the delinquency cf the aecu'eet and
ihe criminality oi the accuser Tney « ill judge,
and correctly, too, w ho are the most exposed to
corruption, who most like ly lo yield the postmas-
ters, with such salaries as these liv ing in the puie
air of the remote interior, among ihe pec pie ibem-
seives, or the men who, withdra vn from ihe people,
stand here, amidst the impurities of the Capitol,
reciprocating public for pnvate favors with the
banks
And here, sir, in passing from this view of the
subject, I will only remark tha', if the liberties ot
the country are ever overthrown, it will be by cor-
ruption, and that if corruption ever strike? into oat
system, to a fatal degree, it will begin and end in
the legislative department. This apprehension is
authorised by history, and arises from the fact, that
whilst a legislative body Is necessarily sn small
that a majority of its members may have each an
mdivldnal interest m measures adverse to the
general interests of the community, such a body is
yet so large that the individual responsibility of
each member is weakened and obscured in the
ci owd It is between these extremes of great inte-
rests and little responsibility, of great temptation
and little danger, that corruption strikes, for detec-
tion is ever difficult, and impunity probable, when
enme comes in organized masses
If, Mr President, the tendency of the banking
system to exert unwholesome influences over le-
gislative bodies, and if the exposure of those bo-
dies to such influences were not already apparent,
these facts might be clearly demonstrated by the ex-
traordinary changes m the relations of public men
since the bank contest began. The great body of the
people have stood immovably opposed to a Na-
tional Bank, and as invariably favorable to a re-
formation of the whole banking system And
yet how numerous are their public agents, who,
after their elections to Congress or the State Le-
gislatures, have shifted their giound upon all these
questions'! But where have they gone? What
has been the result of thes« changes? How few
who were friendly, have become unfavorable to
banks'! How many who were opposed have be-
come friendly to them1! Upon the knoWn prin-
ciples of the human mind, when acting beyond the
sphere of adventitious influences, it might be sup-
posed that these changes, for and against, would,
in some degree, have counteracted each other.
Hassuih been the fief No, sir the betrayed De-
mocracy of the Union feel, and will never forget,
that these e hinges m the course of their public
agents have been almost nmfoimly against the
eounti), milin favoi of the banks And why
this strange coincidence? Is it because the conduct
of these institutions has been such as to induce a
behel in then purity and innocence5 If so, why
has the same conduct tended only to strengthen in
the minds of the people themselves, the opposite
convic'ion' No, sir, no there can be but little,
there can be no difficulty, in solving the secret.
Scarcely a man, of all the deserters from the De-
mocratic ranks, leaves behind him a doubt as to
to the place of his destination. When he goes, no
icwarel i~. necessary to his detection He is to be
found m the vault of a bank—there is the attrac-
tion, and to that point he gravitates
The Senator from Virginia, [Mr Rivrs] in the
zeal of his o position to the bill before us, has been
pleased to attribute the present condition of Ihe
banks to " the hostile action of the Government"—
to " the Tieasury order " I regretted to hearsuch
a charge from such a source That Senator has
long been a member of the party to whose agency
he now ascribes these ciiminal results We had a
reason to hope, and a right to believe, that his op-
position to the measure would he that of a friend
dis entmg with regret, not such an opposition as
might be expected from one eagerly seizing an oc-
casion lo crn uñate his old associates, oi from an
enemy venting the lage of veteran hostility This
1 inguage is the more to be regretted, because,
whilst it is lender d doubly painful by the sincerity
of former friendsh ps, it seems to spring from a
conviction that those friendships may never be re-
newed Had the Senator but gently chided his
friends for what he supposed to be the impolicy of
the pending measure, had he uttered but the coun-
sels of mild .dmonition, he would then have
fvinced an unchanged temper of mind, lendenng
the prrbabihty oí "us future co-operation more
than an equivalent lor his present opposition If,
however, he could no1, in sincerity, do this, if he
has fixed his purpose to depart for ever, m spite of
all the associations which formerly bound him to
the Democracy of the Union, if such be his des-
tiny, then not a syllable remains to be pronounced
by his ancient friends but the melancholy word—
Farewell'
