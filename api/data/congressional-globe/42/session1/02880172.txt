_ The VICE PRESIDENT. In regard to the
joint resolution relative to the erection of the
Morse monument, being House joint resolu-
tion No. 81, the Chair desires to state that the
Senator from Vermont, [Mr. Morrill,] who

regarded as receded from. It is so ordered,

Mr. CORBETT. Before the Senator from
Mississippi proceeds, I ask the Senate to con-
cur in the amendments of the House of Rep-
resentatives to Senate bill No, 202, which is
on the table. It is a matter simply as to the
appointment of a young man to a lieutenancy
in the Navy. I should like to have it acted on
now, as I have to leave the city this evening.

joint committee on southern disorders.
Mr. ANTHONY. I believe there is on the
table an amendment of the House of Repre-
sentatives to our concurrent resolution provid-
ing "for a joint committee to investigate the
condition of the South, which amendment
relates only to the number of members of the
committee, and as to making the expenses
payable out of the contingent fund of the Sen-
ate icstead of out of the contingent fund of
both txouses. That is of no consequence,
because we shall have to make an appropria-
tion in the pending appropriation bill for the
expenses of the committee.
Mr. SUMNER. I think that had better lie
on the table until to-morrow.
Sir. ANTHONY. Allow me to ask the
Chair whether this concurrent resolution will be
placed before the Senate to-morrow morning?
The VICE PRESIDENT. It will be, at the
opening of the session to-morrow under the

senators erom alabama and georgia.
Mr. STEWART. I desire to submit a report
from the Committee on Privileges and Elec-
tions, which I should like to have read, as it
is in but a few words.
The report was read, as follows:
The Committee on Privileges and Elections, to
which wore referred the credentials of George Gold-
t nwaite, cla lining aseat in this body as a Senator from
too State oi Alabama, and tho credentials of Foster
jjlouKett, claiming a seat in this body as a Senator
troni the State of Georgia, reports:
That said credentials are in due form and prima
facie entitle said Goldthwaite and Blodgett to their
seats upon taking the oaths prescribed by the Con-
stitution and laws, neither of them being under any
disability.
The grounds on which their right to seats is con-
testedhave not been fully considered by the com-
mittee for want of time, nor will there be sufficient
time at this session to consider them. In the opin-
ion of your committee it would be unjust to those
States and gentlemen to keep the latter out of
their scats until such investigation can be had.
The committee, therefore, report the following res-
olution.
Resolved, That George Goldthwaite and Foster
Blodgett be permitted to take seats in this body
upon taking the proper oaths, and that the Com-
mittee on Privileges and Elections proceed here-
after to consider the grounds on which their rights
to seats respectively are contested, and hereafter
makereports to theSenate thereon.

not as to Blodgett.
JOSHUA HILL.
A. G. TIIURMAN.
Mr. HILL. I move to amend the resolution
of the committee 
Mr. SHERMAN. It had better lie over.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The resolution is
not nowbefore the Senate, unless by unanimous
consent.
Mr. HILL. I ask that a brief of the argu-
ment for the protestants in Mr. Blodgett's case
be printed in connection with this report.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Does the Senator
from Nevada consent to that proposition?
Mr. STEWART. 1 have no objection to
printing it.
Mr. HILL. It is a succinct statement of
tlie-case, and a very clear one.
Mr. STEWART. It does not come from
the committee.
Mr. HILL. No ; but it was agreed there
that it should be printed.
Mr. STEWART. I have no objection to
printing it, but I wish to have early action on
this resolution.
Mr. POMEROY. Why can we not adopt
it now?
Mr. HILL. Not to-day. It can be acted
on to-morrow, perhaps. I wish to have this
document printed first.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The business
regularly before the Senate is the resolution
introduced by the Senator from Rhode Island
as to the business of the session.

call up in the morning hour to-morrow the res-

The VICE PRESIDENT. The resolution
of the Senator from Rhode Island is before
the Senate, upon which the Senator from Mis-
sissippi [Mr. Ames] is entitled to the floor.
_ Mr. RAMSEY. The Senator from Missis-
sippi gives way to rae that I may move 
Mr. ANTHONY. The Senator from Min-
nesota is rising, I know, for the fell purpose
of moving an adjournment or an executive
session. I was in hopes that we should get a
vote upon this resolution to-night, and I trust
now that the Senator from Minnesota will post-
pone his motion.
Mr. RAMSEY. We ought to have an ex-
ecutive session.
Mr. ANTHONY. Does the Senator from
Mississippi desire to address the Senate upon
this resolution rather than upon the resolution
of the Senator from Ohio ?
Mr. RAMSEY. It is the desire of the Sen-
ator from Mississippi that I should move that
the Senate now proceed to the consideration
of executive business. I should like to oblige
my friend from Rhode Island, but I insist on
my motion that the Senate proceed to the con-
sideration of executive business.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. ANTHONY. Now I give notice to the
Senate that I shall expect them to remain in
