Respectfully returned.

It will be impossible to fill up these organizations from the present command without breaking up others, and I must depend upon re-enforcements for to purpose.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,May 29, 1864. (Received 9.30 a. m.)

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

I commenced the establishment of my line from Norman's to Haw's Store, and upon reaching the latter place I found that I made no connection with Hancock. In following down the road I found that his left was about 800 yards in rear of my right, and I understand from General Birney that you authorized him to establish his line there. Shall I connect with him? My men are very weary, being almost constantly on the road for two days and nights.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

MAY 29, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I would most respectfully state that I think the line now occupied by Hancock is a stronger line than the one now ordered, and a road can be cut in rear of our lines for the movement of troops. I am at General Hancock's now; am waiting an answer.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
