the orders of the day.

CIVIL LIST BILL
On motion of Mr CAMBRELENG, the House
took up the "bill making appropnations foi the
civil and diplomatic expenditures of the Govern-
ment for the year 1838 "
The amendments of the Committee of the
Whole, with a few exceptions which will be here-
after noticed, were taken up, and concurred in
The House then took up the amendment of the
committee, increasing the item for the íehef and
proctecticn of American seamen in foreign coun
tries, $10 000
Mr A'H SHEPPERD made some fe v íe-
marks, m explanation of his lemarks in Committee
of the Whole, and showing the manner in which
this appropriation was disbursed by the Depart-
ment, and contrasting it with the manner in which
it had been disbursed heretofore
Mr HOWARD replied to the gentleman fiom
North Carolina, setting forth the manner ¡n which
this fraud was drawn upon, and showing that
there was none of it laj mg m the hands of Govern-
ment agents unexpended, and went on to exhibit
the evil consequences of not making these appro-
priations m due time The unceitamty which ex-
isted in relation to the payment of these drafts was
the main cause of the losses of the Government,
and he hoped some arrangement might j et be made
by which this fund would never be out.
Mr ADAMS did not considei that the delay
which had taken place on this bill, m consequence
of the discussion of this item, would be productive
of evil, because by it we had discovered the cause
of the required increase of th s fund. It was now
discovered that it was in consequence of the man-
ner of making remittances abroad that this fund
had to be increased, and this being discovered, he
hoped a remedy might be applied to meet the case
He believed a new mode of remitting this fund had
been adopted, which acted most unfavorably The
new system was for the consuls to draw on the
Department of State, without regard to the rites of
exchange, and it was in consequence of this that
bills had been negotiated at d loss of twenty-five
per cent. The old system was to transmit the
iunds at a time when exchange was most favorable
to this country, and this system he (Mr. A ) con-
sidered by far the most preferable, and he hoped
the Committee on Expenditures of that Depart-
ment would see to this matter, and endeavor to
have it remedied
Mr MATHIAS MORRIS stated that, as a mem-
ber sf the Committee on Expenditures of this de-
paitment, he had made some inquiry in relation to
the disburseaients of this fund, and had received
communications from that department on the sub-
ject He then sent to the Cleik's table the letters
he had received from the department, which set
forth fully the manner m which this fund was dis-
bursed by that department
Mr CAMBRELENG said that the practice now
existing was not only according to law, but he
would rather have these accounts audited here by
the Treasury officers than by our foreign ministers
abroad, as they were formerly He considered the
lules established by the Department of State in
1834 the correct and proper rule of action, and if it
might have been proper that another course should
have been pursued twenty or thirty years ago, it
was not proper now Drafts could now be nego-
tiated on New York as well as they could be on
London or Paris, and he could see no objection to
the present system pursued by the Department
Mr. ADAMS íeiterated his objections to this
new system, and insisted that it was this system
had cost the Government the additional appro-
priation asked for.
Mr HOWARD dissented from the gentleman
from Massachusetts, m relation to the conclusion
which the gentleman had come to, and went into a
brief explanation of the manner in which the fund
w as managed by the Depai tment
After a lew remarks by Mr \ H SHEPPERD,
the amendment oí the committee was concurred in
The House then took up the amendment in re-
lation to thejei d'eau and the improvement of the
public square around the Capitol
After a few remarks by Messrs HOWARD,
MERCER, LINCOLN, UNDERWOOD, and
HALSTEAD,

which were ordered, and were—jeas 93, nays 56
So the amendment was agreed to
The House then took up the amendment of
$1,900 for distibution of the first volume of the
Documentary History oí the Revolution, which, at
the suggestion of Mr. CAMERELENG, was non-
concuired in.
The House then took up the following amend-
ment
For the service of the General Post Office for the
) ear eighteen hundred and thirty-eight, in confor-
mity to the act of second July, eighteen hundred
and thnty-six, four million six hundred and ninety-
four thousand dolldis, viz

For miscellaneeus             -           -          40,000
Mr WHITTLESEY of Ohio considered that if
the item in this amendment of $140,000 for clerks
for offices was agieed to, the items in the bill for
the clerks and messengers in the Post Office De-
partment ought to be struck out, because there
would then, in his opinion, be a double appropria-
tion for this purpose He took it that it was the
intention of the Postmaster Geneial, by asking for
this item, to supersede by it the necessity oí the
other appropriation to which he had alluded, and if
ihis was the case, it would be proper that one of
these items should be struck out.
Mr CAMBRELENG said the gentleman from
Ohio was mistaken m the view he had taken of
this question. He explained that the Clerks in
the Post Office Department m Washington, had
always been paid out of the public Treasury, and
the item for their pay had always been inserted in
this bill, but the Clerks in the Post Offices
throughout the country had been paid out of
the Post Office fund heretofore, and no notice
had ever been taken of it in the bills making ap-
propriations for the expenditures of the Govern-
ment It had now, however, in consequence of
the law of 1836, which required this fund to be paid
into the Treasuiy, become necessary to make this
appropriation in our appropriation bills This ap-
propriation, as it did formerly, was made from the
Post Office fund, but the other appropriation, for
the Head of the Department and clerks and mes-
sengeis, were made out of the common fund of the
nation
Mi WHITTLESEY did not consider that he
was mistaken, and still believed these two appropri-
ations to be for the same purpose, because it never
had been the practice at the Post Office Depai tment
to keep any account of the salaries of the clerks in.
the different post offices The plan pursued was
for the different postmasters to pay all the expenses
of their offices, for clerks as well as other expenses,
out of the money which they collee'ed, and no
account was ever kept at the Post Office Depart-
ment, of the salaries of these clerks, consequently,
this appropriation of $140,000 in the amendment
could not be foi that object, unless the system of
doing business in that Department had been
changed lately Perhaps the chairman of the Post
Office committee could give some information as to
that fact
Mr MONTGOMERY said he had no in-
formation other than what was contained m the
public document lying on the tables of the House,
lie, howe\er, had always understood that the
clerks of the different post offices throughout the
country were paid out of the post office fund, and
that the clerks of the Department in this city weie
paid out of the common fund in the Tieasury.
Mr HAYNES said if the gentleman from Ohio
would examine the Blue Book, he would find a
list of some four hundred clerks in post offices dis-
tributed thioughout the country, and, at a very
moderate compensation, it would require this item
of $140,000 to pay them It would be found, he
believed, that these salares would average consi-
derably less than four hundred dollars, and no one,
he thought, could complain of these salaries It
was true we had not been heretofore called
on to make this appropriation, and it was very
easily accounted for The House heretofore never
made any approptiations for the expenses of
the Post Office Department, except the salanes of
the Postmaster General, and the clerks in his of-
fice in tins city—the other expenses of the De-
partment being paid out of the Post Office fund,
without it having any connection with the public
Treasury Since the reorganization of that De-
partment, however, it was required that the Post
Office fund should be paid into the Treasury, and it
being paid in, it was necessary that this appropria-
tion should be made to get it out again
Mr WHITTLESEY was still convinced that
he was right m relation to this mauei, and that the
gen'leman from New York, and the gentleman
fio n Georgia, «ere wiong Taking the Blue Book
as a f ude, and admitting that there were four hun-
dred cieikstobe paid out oí this fund, it would
show that there was some mistake about it, be-
cause it would be entirely too small for that pur-
pose. His opinion was, that the Postmaster Gene-
ral, considering the state of the finance of the coun-
try, and of the Post Office Department, had intro-
duced this item for the pay of the clerks in his
office with a view of having them paid out of the
Post Office fund, and if that was the case, the other
appropriations ougl t to be struck out of the bill.
Mi HAYNES stated ¡n reply to the remaik
of the gentleman from Ohio, in íegard to the item
of $140,000 being too small to pay the salaries
of the roui hundred clerks, without having any
intercourse with the Department on the subject, that
ihe natural inference in relation to it, was that the
Postmaster General might have discovered that
