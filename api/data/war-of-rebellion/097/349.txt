HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865-2.15 p. m.

Major-General WEBB:

From the prisoners taken it is apparent that the left of Pickett's division is opposite the center of Miles'. An advance of the Fifth Corps swinging around must necessarily taken Pickett on his right flank. Pickett is the right of their line.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865-2.25 [p. m.]

General HUMPHREYS:

If you can support Miles with your own corps do so, and act independent of the Fifth Corps. The general commanding approves of your taking the enemy's line.

A. S. WEBB,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,March 31, 1865-2.30 p. m.

General WEBB:

The batteries upon the flank of our troops fire as the troops advance, and upon the enemy's artillery as far as they can see them.

Brevet Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

Eleven prisoners from Wise's brigade have just come in from Miles' front, and report Pickett, Johnson, and some of Heth engaged in the attack. It is probable that Wilcox is engaged also. As yet I have no evidence of Heth's being engaged in this fighting on Miles' front.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865-2.30 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Commanding Second Corps:

General Warren did not retire [intend] to move forward his right, but to swing on it, moving his left. I have sent him your dispatch, and suggested his pushing his right forward. At the same time I desire you [to] govern Miles' movement by the supports you can give him, and if he does not feel secure in advancing without Warren let him hold on till Warren does move his right or he has himself force enough to watch his left. You know the difficulty of getting two bodies
