General BEAUREGERD,

Commanding Army:

GENERAL: The enemy have several hndered at Decatur and this side. My scouts had a skirmish with the enemy seven miles the other side of Courtland; a leitueantn and three men are missing. I do not know what injurey was inflicted on the enemy. The enemy at Decatur expect re- enforcements totehe extent of several thousand. I cannot learn certainly their strngth, but do not think they exceed 5,000. I have only 500 effective men, and will thererfore be unable to hold the Florene bridge aginst so large a force attacking me on this side of the river, but will hold it as long as I can.

I am, with resepct, your obedient servant,

B. H. HELM,

Colonel First Regiment Kentucky Cavalry.
