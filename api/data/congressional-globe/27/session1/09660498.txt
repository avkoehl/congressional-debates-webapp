APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Bankrupt Bill—Mr* Barnard 
August, 1841.
H. of Reps
all that relates to policy, or principles, or details, or admiois
tration, as affecting this subject  was critically coii^ideied ard
«xamined an \ then the Senate came tn voting In thit, process,
•nough was i lopted, and enough rejected, to enable the Senate
to discover whit general featmes and provisions must be m
clucied m any bill, and what must be excluded from any hi!l
which should be piescnted to the Senate with any hope of its
commanding the assent of a majority of that bo iy Tlie wh e
subject was the  referred to a select committee to digt t the
matter which appeared to have received the sanction of a r a
¡onty,mto the form of a bill i hi* x k was aceomph nt-d, ad
an eminent ¡Senator from Kentuck), now the firet law officei of
this Government, as chairman of the select commi 'ee, rep rted
a bill, which, after being again discussed, ind receiving so tie
amendments, was passed by the Sena'e and &ent to th & Hou e
fonts concurrance
In this House, it was found, by the time the bill came in n t
the channels of business were too full and too much obstruct 1
to allow the friends of the measure to hope that it could be con
ttdered or reached dunn&(the period of the session that ie
mamed    The bill, therefogfc, was at once laid on the table
At the succeeding session—the second session of the la t Con
jrress—the subject was promptly resumed m the ^emte Mi
Crittenden introduced his bill, on notice and motion snbstan
«ally the same which had been matured and passed at the pre
yious session The bill was discussed, from ti n to tmit ft r
eonje weeks, when it was found that n must a^m ba cnwded
out by the pressure of pub'ic business mcidei t to a stnrt ses
«ion of Congress, and especially incident to that sht rt session
The hill was then hud aside by the consent of it fnenls,
and with the understanding that the subject should again be
taken up at the next session
At the commencement of the present session, the subject was
referred, m each House, to the Committee on f~e Tudicmy
In each House a bill has been reported, both b lis hems sub
siantially identical with th it which had been mat' red in the
Senate m the first session of the laát Congress Well sir the
Senate has again proceeded to action—has again considered the
measure—and has again given its voice and sanction ío a bul
substantially the sime as I efore, though w h some futihti
amendments, which it has sent to this Huu^e foi its ooncui
rence That bill is now befoieus loi oui consideration and
judgment
Mr Chairman, under the circumstance*? here detailed I pio
posetoask the committee to consider the subject mainly ii no
wholly, with a view to determine wheti er the u mimittee ar 1
the House can and will, or cannot and will n coucui with

case which arises among creditois an 1 between thun them in 1
their debtor, when such debtor has filien into uttci insolvency,
which is intended to bepiovidedfor
Ihe bill contains two dib met sets of piovision -—one itla ins;
to creditors and the ottn i relating to d&i  oí4" i i th st are
here united and combined into one uniform i i mnu-s, «nd

so much on (Sie subject on toe subject as may enable me to
make myself intelligible m regard to the principles on which m
my individual opinion, a bankrupt system like the one here
pioposed properly stands
Sir, it is a remarkable ihing that the com non liw makes no
provision whatever foi cases of insolvency    it   ^m*, toas
sume the fact of solvency and ability in all case-, vhatsoevei
and it attributes all failures in the pertnrm \r  p of onga^ementa

W°il Mr Chairman the bill on your table contains provi
sions applicable to cases of insolvency, and intended to meet
the ru e ot jucUop in all tht, paititulars here mentioned
Th first impoitan* step m ti e case is to ascertain the fact
of insolvency, an Khis is done in two general modes In the
first place, every debtoi and any debtor of whatevei character
or description mav mal c a vo untary declaration of his mso]

claicd the next car^of the hill is o proTide for secunng the
propeity and eflee s ot the debtor for t! e benefit of the credi
tors By operation of law, without any acf of assignment, th"
entire estate is immediately diverted out of the debtor, and
passes to tht, íeceiver or a^^ignec named by the court To
prevent ail concealment and fraud anl a1] pieferenre«, the
debtoi may he subjected to the most rigid personal eYamma
non, un ei oa h and if any thing of the suit is detected, he
foi feits his r ght to a discharge
Themsolven ae=ta e having hus been eeized and secured
fir the deditois the bill proceeds to provide for a prompt and
equitable d s libution of the fund amongst them
