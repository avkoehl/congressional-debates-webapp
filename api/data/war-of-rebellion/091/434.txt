tion, from many of whom I have received, unsolicited, assurances of thie disapprobation of the blind partisan zeal of those few political tricksters, and their regret that I should have been made its victim. Before closing my official papers, no loess than five officers, each having a separate place of business, were installed in the performance of those duties I had so long discharged alone-viz, military commander of the State, Colonel Bowman; military commander of the post, Colonel Clark; military provost-marshal, Captain Wenie; commissary of subsistence, Captain Bilyeu; mustering and disbursing officer, Major Bootes-who are understood to have been called here by, and subject to the control of, the same political influence which caused my removal, and which boasts that any officer presuming to oppose it shall be removed. It is not with any design of regaining a position from which I have been so rudely displaced that I have intruded upon you this long statement, for I could not return to it under existing circumstances with satisfaction or credit; but because of my desire to place myself in a right light with those whose esteem I value, and to purge my military record of any shade cast upon it by this event.

I remain, general, respectfully and truly, your obedient servant,

HENRY B. JUDD,

Major, U. S. Army.

CHAMBERSBURG, PA., October 20, 1864-noon.

(Received 1 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Governor Curtin is under some apprehension that the rebels will enter this State, and there is some uneasiness among the people of this valley. I have ordered the One hundred and eighty-seventh from Camp Cadwalader, and will hope to have 800 men and four guns, all told. Perhaps can increase the number to 1,000.
