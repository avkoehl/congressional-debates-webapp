WASHINGTON, July 22, 1862.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.

SIR: By the inclosed letters it appears some of the Iowa troops taken prisoners at Shiloh are at Benton Barracks. It is stated in one of the letters they are unpaid and without clothes. I hope this matter has been attended to ere this, but if it has not I earnestly ask that arrangements may be made at once for their relief. It appears from the letter of McMaken that the officers in command and the paroled prisoners do not understand alike the duties of the prisoners in their present situation, and that this misunderstanding has led and is likely to lead to very unpleasant results. I do not know which is right, but it is very desirable that a conflict, such as is shown to exist should be avoided. Will you be kind enough to make some order in the matter and send me a copy? If the boys are in the wrong I will use my best exertions to set them right. I am well satisfied the best way is to exchange them, and as there are a large number of rebel prisoners at Chicago and elsewhere I do not see why it cannot be done.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAMUEL J. KIRKWOOD.

COLUMBUS CITY, LOUISA COUNTY, IOWA, July 16, 1862.

Honorable Mr. KIRKWOOD.

DEAR SIR: Please pardon the liberty I now take in addressing you with reference to a matter in which no one can feel a deeper interest than yourself. But to the point. I have been in regular correspondence with a member of Company C, Eighth Regiment Iowa Volunteers, ever since the mustering of that company into the service. Many of that regiment you are aware were taken prisoners at Shiloh with no other clothing than their fatigue suit. You no doubt are as well aware of their suffering ever since that period as any one. They are now at Benton Barracks in a destitute condition, without a change of clothing, being compelled to wash and dry one piece at a time, and exposed to all the privations, inconvenience, &amp;c., incident to disorganized regiments or companies.

Now, dear Governor, is there no way by which these boys of the noble Eight Iowa, who stood so nobly on that ever memorable and dreadful Sabbath at Pittsburgh Landing from 9 a. m. until past 5 p. m., and though charged upon five times never faltered, standing nobly in the name of Iowa by the flag of this country, while death and disorder reigned and reveled all around, yet still standing like the noble Romans ready to die, but never for a moment thinking of turning their backs upon a foe (I am proud to know that Iowans never to turn backs to a foe), while other regiments were being disorganized and fleeing in confusion and insubordination, yet still like the everlasting rocks they stood firm, the noble boys of Iowa, until both right and left flanks gave way and let the enemy around them in overwhelming numbers, yielding only when they could resist no longer.

Now in the name of that incomparable conduct, the suffering of that raining and hailing night- wet, cold and hungry, and their future suffering as prisoners among barbarians- can we do anything for them? Can you by any effort secure their immediate back pay? The boys are penniless. If they cannot be paid off or in part immediately can you secure permission for them to return for the time being to their friends?
