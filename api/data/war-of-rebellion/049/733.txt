HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA,Dublin, September 18, 1863.

Colonel GEORGE S. PATTON,

Commanding First Brigade:

Order the Eighth Virginia Cavalry to report to Colonel McCausland immediately. Jenkins' brigade has just been ordered from its present position. One regiment ordered to Little Levels, Pocahontas, one to Colonel McCausland, one to Lewisburg and Witcher's battalion to Zollicoffer, East Tennessee.

You must employ the Greenbrier cavalry and such portions of Dunn's battalion as you think proper to scout in your front until the regiment of Jenkins' brigade gets up. Send a copy of this to Colonel William L. Jackson immediately. He will notify General Imboden of this move.

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond:

Am satisfied, from information sent you in my telegram, that the salt-works are in imminent danger. The Sixtieth Virginia Regiment is at Narrows of New River. I think it can be spared, though Colonel McCausland will then be left at Princeton with less than two regiments. In any event he can retreat safely to the Narrows. Shall I order the Sixtieth to Saltville, and take the risk in front?

I cannot hear from General Jones. The enemy is betwee us, if reports are true, and I therefore ask that you will reply to-night. Wharton cannot resist the force opposed to him if as reported, and they move on him instead of against General Jones.

If Scammon and Kelley make a simultaneous move in front, the withdrawal of the Sixtieth may lead to serious consequences here and on the Staunton line.

Please instruct me immediately.

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA,Dublin, September 19, 1863.

Major JOSEPH F. KENT,

Wytheville:

Collect every man you can and go at once to Glade Spring. The defense of Wytheville will be best made there. Enemy 7 miles this side of Bristol this morning, and steadily advancing on Abingdon and Saltville.

Reply.

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
