places of rendezvous, and to hold them when there until I can have them mustered into service. I suggest that a provost-marshal be appointed for each county, that I may instruct them to collect the men and deliver them at the places of rendezvous. I wish to place the camps at Philadelphia, Harrisburg, and Pittsburg each in charge of a field officer or captain of experience of the Regular Army, to maintain guards and enforce discipline. Can they be sent to me? The State authorities, whilst they would prefer a different course with respect to the assignment of the drafted men, acquiesce in the measures of the Government, but they are powerless to coerce the men, and the military power alone can do it. Furloughs have been freely given to the men, but this I have stopped. Officers are rapidly arriving to receive their recruits, and they can aid me greatly by representing to them the advantages of joining the old regiments.

Adjutant-General THOMAS,

Harrisburg:

The Governor and Mr. Meredith have both been informed that I am ready to appoint any officer or agent they desire and that General Porter should have the authority of provost-marshal and be assigned to any command they deem expedient. If you will send me the names of proper persons I will also appoint provost- marshals in the respective counties. I do not know who should be appointed, and names have not been furnished me. I will ask General Halleck to assign officers for command of camps immediately.

Adjutant-General THOMAS,

General Canby having reached here he has been ordered by the General-in-Chief to report to you. He has also ordered General Palmer, now in New Jersey, to do the same. You can station one of these officers at Philadelphia in charge of one camp and the other at Pittsburg, remaining yourself in general charge at Harrisburg. General Porter can also be appointed provost-marshal.
