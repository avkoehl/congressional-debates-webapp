THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 9,
the practice of the law in rural districts; atid
this mode of life, so congenial tci his taStes, he
continued until the breaking out of the great
insurrection. He then at once publicly and de-
cidedly pronounced for "the union, the Con-
stitution , and the enforcement of the laws,'' gave
his whole influence and effort to uphold the
proper and constitutional authority of the Gov-
ernment, and urged and aided a gallant sbn to
faise one of the noblest regiments that served
in tlie Union Army. In 1861 his countrymen
once more summoned him to the civil serv-ice
by electing him for the third term to the House Of
Congress; .and they reelected him in 1863, and
again in 1865. He served through the most of
the last session, but near its close, admonished
by the grasp of mortal disease, he quilted this
city ana the discharge of his public duties for-
ever, and hurried home to die.
He was even then apparently possessed of
an uncommon amount of physical strength for
one of his age, and his colleagues were deluded
into and expressed confidently to him their
belief that he would soon be well; but he
spoke his dissent in a few solemn words that
showed his unerring conviction that his time
had come. lie reached his home; his disease
continued to march quietly but steadily upon
him until the 7th of September, when with
undisturbed reason and a serene spirit, sur-
rounded by his friends, he sunk beneath its
force to his eternal rest. He was a ripe sheaf,
&fvd was fully ready for the Great Harvester.
Religious sentiment was the most prominent
feature in the character of Colonel Grider. In
his early youth he became a professing Chris-
tian and attached himself to the Methodist
Episcopal church, in which connection he con-
tinued until his death. In his religious life he
combined the simplicity, truth, purity, and
steadiness of the primitive Christians with
the^ spirit of charity, forgiveness, and pcace
which its sinless author preached, and which
could emanate only from Divinity. For more
than fifty years his walk of life was serenely lit
up by the brightness of his faith and works,
mellowed by true Christian humility.
Ho possessed groat physical strength and
dauntless courage, and a warm and impetuous
spirit; and though his strong sense of justice
ever restrained him from being an aggressor,
every assailant of his rights found him prompt
and effective in their defense. But desislanee
never failed to appease him, and any manifest-
ation of regret or purpose to make atone-
ment always won his prompt and full forgive-
ness; and when convinced of having done
wrong to any one he never rested until he had
made the amplest reparation. Envy, malice,
cruelly, or revenge found no resting-place with
him. The genius, endowments, honor, fame,
and fortune of olherswere appropriated by his
unselfish and noble heart as the sources of his
own personal happiness; and he rejoiced in
their existence everywhere as the common
riches of his countrymen and of mankind.
In all the relations of life he was without
reproach. His system of ethics taught him
that the essential nature of public and private
villainy, of public and private virtue, were the
same; and he equally reverenced and supported
the one and abhorred and contested the other.
In politics he was too pure, too enlightened
and patriotic to be a partisan ; in religion too
charitable and humble, too deeply imbued with
the spirit of his Divine Master to be a bigot,
liven rivalry and enmity always pronounced
upon him the most concise, most comprehen-
sive, and the noblest of all eulogies, " IIenrt
Giiider is an honest man and a Christian."
lo his congressional associates lie gave from
day to day an unobtrusive but noble pattern
of virtue and patriotism. His death filled with
general sorrow the community in wlneh he
lived, and his name will live there among the
.most cherished.
