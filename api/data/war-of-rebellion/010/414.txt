Numbers 143. Report of Brigadier General Charles Clark, C. S. Army, commanding First Division.
HDQRS. FIRST DIV., FIRST CORPS, ARMY OF THE MISS.,April 8, 1862.

MAJOR: On the evening of the 3rd instant my division (composed of the Second Brigade, commanded by Brigadier-General Stewart, and the First brigade, by Colonel R. M. Russell, of the Twelfth Tennessee Regiment) moved as ordered, and halted for the night on the ridge road to Pittsburg, about 9 miles from Corinth.

At daylight on the 4th we resumed the march, but were soon ordered to halt to permit the troops of Major-General Hardee to pass to our front.

On Sunday morning, the 6th instant, the two brigades, the Second in front, marched to the field, as ordered by Major-General Polk, in line of battle, the center on the Pittsburg road, Stanford's battery attached to and following the Second in the road and Bankhead's battery the First.

When within about 1,000 yards of the enemy's camps the left flank of each line, while passing through a field, was exposed to a fire of round shot and shell from a battery of the enemy, but no casualties occurred, although the battery continued to fire upon us for thirty minutes. When we arrived within 300 yards of Major-General Bragg's line General. A. Sidney Johnston ordered me to send the Second Brigade, by a flank
