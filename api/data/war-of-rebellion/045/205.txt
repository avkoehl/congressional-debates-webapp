Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I have detailed Brigadier-General Ewen, of my division, to proceed with his brigade to Harrisburg to-morrow. The whole number from my division will exceed 7, 000. I have taken these troops, under your telegram of the 16th, for thirty days, unless sooner discharged. Please send me a telegram to authorize the United States mustering officers at Harrisburg to muster in these troops with their brigadiers, &amp;c., as detailed by me, for that time, dating from their departure from New York. Oblige.

Yours, truly,

C. W. SANDFROD.

WASHINGTON CITY, June 18, 1863-9. 45 p. m.

Adjutant-General SPRAGUE, Albany:

The President directs me to return his thanks to His Excellency Governor Seymour, and his staff, for their energetic and prompt action. Whether any further force is likely to be required will be communicated to you to-morrow, by which time it is expected the movements of the enemy will be more fully developed.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

WASHINGTON, June 18, 1863.

His Excellency Governor SMITH, Providence, R. I.:

Any regiments of militia that may enlist for six months will be accepted and credited to the State, under the twelfth section of the enrollment act, for the actual term of service enlisted, but they cannot be counted as three-years, men. The credit can be given to the State only for the term of service. Advance pay and bounty can only be given to those who enlist for three years or during the war. No extra compensation is allowed by law for those enlisting for six months.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

Secretary of War.
