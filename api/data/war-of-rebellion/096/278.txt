Full report of Beverly affair was sent you two days ago, together with recommendations in the case.* General Kelley's scouts, sent out from New Creek, report that Gilmor has been sent to Moorefield, to take command of McNeill's and Woodson's force, together with other detachments, in all amounting to 300 or 400 men. Surgeon Cracraft, Nineteenth Virginia Cavalry (rebel), in a letter to his wife, states that Jackson's brigade expects to winter near Staunton, either in Bath or Pocahontas County.
