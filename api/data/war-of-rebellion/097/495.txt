Major-General.

Major-General ORD:

Major-General Miles attacked what was left of Heth's and Wilcox's divisions in a strongly position at Sutherland's Station this afternoon and utterly routed them, capturing about 1,000 prisoners and 2 field pieces. As the cavalry was coming down the road on which they retreated I am in hopes of hearing yet to-night of the balance being picked up.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

ORD'S HEADQUARTERS,

April 2, 1865.

General WRIGHT:

You should have some officers from the front to be ready to meet my command and hurry them where most needed. I send you General Gibbon with four brigades. You can call on the brigade nearest to you by Fort Sampson.

E. O. C. ORD.

ORD'S HEADQUARTERS,

April 2, 1865.

General WRIGHT:

I have sent you all I had to spare. The line from Hatcher's to Fort Welch is reported in our possession-7 guns, 2 battle-flags, and large number of prisoners, under Gibbon.

E. O. C. ORD.

APRIL 2, 1865.

Major-General WEITZEL:

Wright and Parke attacked the enemy this morning and carried the works on their front, capturing guns and prisoners; number not stated. Wright's men have cut the telegraph wire on the Boydton plank road. Ord is re-enforcing Wright. No report from Ord, but he has apparently taken the works on his front. Humphreys advanced, and the only report from him says he had captured the enemy's picket and 120 prisoners. This at 7.40. He has evidently carried everything in his front, as his firing rapidly advanced. Sheridan has been re-enforced by Miles' division of infantry and from Five Forks is sweeping eastward toward Petersburg. The greatest vigilance is necessary on your part that the enemy do not cross the Appomattox to overwhelm and drive back Parke. Wright is now tearing up the South Side road.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
