defence of the country in the completion of the work  men
tioned in the bill, and that they shall be applied and appiopri
ated yeaily until said work shall be complettd "
The CHAIR decided this motion not to be m order, as it
was in direct conflict with the refu at of the House, last
evening, to reconsider the vote by which it had passed a
bill making a different application of the pioceeds of the public
lands
Trom this decision Mr ATHERTON took an appeal

Thellous  then on motion ef Mi TILLMORE went into
G-unmittteof the Whole on the slate of the Union, (Mr
Brisgs of Mass in the chair)
Mr UNDERWOOD moved to tale up the bul making a
furtbei provision for the maintenance of pauper lunatics in the
Distna of Columbia, which motion prevailed
The bill havine been read through—
Mi' GUSHING moved to strike out the preamble
Mr UNDERWOOD concuned m the motion
And the preambje was atnekenout, and the first section ver
bally amended
Mr CAVE IOHNSON observed that, when a bill foi the
same object had passed the House at Ihe last session, toe '•om
mittee had assured it tSat the sum Ihen granted (3 000) would
be amply sufficient for the object now more than as much was
demanded again What had been done with the money appio
pnated last year?
Mr UNDERWOOD went briefly into a statement of the
fads It was very lrue that Ihe bill of last year had been Ii
mited as had been stated, yet thei additional sum in the present
bill was nevertheless now needed There were in all 23 unfor
túnate persons withm the provisi ins of (his bid The marshal
of the Distn t had reported to the court, as appeared by th<
certification of the court ítscF, that their maintenance and ma
nagement at the \sylum foi the Insane at Baltimore would cost
$5 aweer, and that $12 per head had been paid for then íemo
vil 11 that place This would amount to ¿2G0 pel annum for
each m hvldual so that the ippropnelion madelistyeai was
sutncientonly formnorut or t e twenty three
Mi CAVE JOHNSON sail something in reply not distinctly
heaid, butein leiotood tobe, in substance, that the expense was
much too taige, ard had almost all been incurred niconse
qeience of sending off the=p insane paupers to Baltimore
Ml ROO^EVLLl ol *spw \oik, wistung to maeesomege
neral reraaiks upon the bib n oidei to lendei them in order,
moved to striko cut the en cting clause He then went into a
history oí what had bet n d me loi lunatics by the Legislature
of New York, the compaia vely small sum at first a^ked for
as all sufficient and the si ccessive new demands made every
every yeai, S75,000, which, it was piomised, would complete an
asylum foi then reception was mod just to have raised the
building ibove the gionnd &70090moie were granted the foi
iowins session and SHOO 000 at a succeeding one, and thus it
went on till the build ng would probably cost not less than half
a million of dollars, whilt. another had raised i s marble front
on an island in the East river Theie was no end toihis pro
cess It was like the appiopmtions asked for internal improve
inents, which might, by the by, with greater piopnety be called
eternal luq lovem nts for Ihe appbcationslor money seemed
to have no end He wanted to know beforehand exactly how
much be was to give a id to have this in some wntien, respon
siblefoim I wis evident in tb s case eilhei that theinfoima

that now stated was He was will ng to deal ¡ indly and libe
lally with ihtse unfirtunate ciedtuies, but he was not willing
o "o on in the laik
Mi WEI IER had voted fit the bil passed at the Iae>tses
sion of Congie s under the impres ion that that sum would
be sufficient Fue d as he was to retrenchment, he would not
commence refoim on this unfoi túnate class of society, who had
beendepuved of their reason by the Coo of Heaven It should
