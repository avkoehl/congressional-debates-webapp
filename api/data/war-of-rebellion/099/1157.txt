General S. COOPER,

Richmond, Va.:

It is deemed best that prisoners at Florence be sent to Salisbury rather than prison near this place. General Bragg can probably furnish 500 men to guard them. Please give the necessary orders.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

RICHMOND, VA., February 11, 1865.

General W. J. HARDEE,

Charleston, S. C.:

Your telegrams of the 9th and 10th received. The indications suggest Charleston as the objective point, and if you have supplies inside the works and General Beauregard has the hoped-for success in concentrating the army and in raising auxiliary forces in Georgia and South Carolina, the attempt of the enemy will, I hope, be reduced to operations on the sear front and be finally defeated.

Your wishes in regard to General Allen and Mercer have been noted and inquiry made for a good brigadier of Georgia who is unassigned. In the meantime you will please send on a nomination as I may not find one. Where is Major-General Martin. of the cavalry? Why is he not in command of his division?

JEFF'N DAVIS.

COLUMBIA, S. C., February 11, 1865.

Lieutenant General W. J. HARDEE,

Commanding Department, Charleston, S. C.:

Hampton having no troops yet to operate with I have placed him in command of this city and vicinity.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

COLUMBIA, S. C., February 11, 1865.

Lieutenant-General HARDEE,

Charleston, S. C. ;

By late movements of the enemy it is apparent that he intends to move upon Charleston, or to cut off your communications along the Northeastern Railroad. It is therefore advisable that you proceed to execute as soon as possible the movement agreed upon the 2nd instant. Guard well your left flank and the crossings of the Santee.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CHARLESTON, S. C., February 11, 1865.

General BEAUREGARD:

Do you direct that the agreement made on the 2nd instant be carried into effect immediately? Please answer at once.

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.
