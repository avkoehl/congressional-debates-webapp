WASHINGTON, d. C.,

January 25, 1863.

Major-General GRANT,

Memphis, Tenn.:

Direct your attention particularly to the canal proposed across the point. The President attaches much importance to this.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

MEMPHIS, Tenn.,

January 25, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I leave for the fleet at Vicksburg to-morrow. Since leaving there, one week ago, I have not had one word from them. The constant rains and tremendous rise in the river may operate against us for the time being.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

MEMPHIS, Tenn.,]

January 27, 1863-7 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

News just received from Vicksburg says water now in old canal, and rising rapidly. In a short time our batteries of Parrott guns will command the river below town. Vicksburg papers say that General Banks is fortifying Baton Rouge. I hold two divisions here ready to re-enforce the expedition as soon as wanted; also Gorman's forces.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General, Commanding.

Vicksburg, MISS.,

January 29, 1863-5 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Water in the canal is 5 feet deep, and river rising. There is no wash, however, and no signs of its enlarging. I will let the water in from the Yazoo up, and try the effect. I have ordered troops from Helena, escorted by a gunboat, the whole in charge of Colonel Wilson, topographical engineer, to cut the levee across Yazoo Pass, and to explore through to the Coldwater, if possible.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

NEAR Vicksburg, MISS.,

January 31, 1863-3 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I am pushing everything to gain a passage, avoiding Vicksburg. Prospects not flattering by the canal of last summer. Other routes are being prospected, and work in the mean time progressing on the old canal.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General, commanding.
