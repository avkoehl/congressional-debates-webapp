1836.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
li)
Military Committee, of w hich the honorable gen
tleman from Kentucky [Mi Johnso\] was chair-
man, had submitted at the last session a most able
and elaborate leport upon the natuie and character
of the institution at West Point, and he could
1 ardlv believe that any unpiejudiced mind could
rise ñ om the perusal of that report without a per-
fect conviction of the utility and necessity of a
militaiy school foi the instruction of our officers
in the elements of imhtaiy science If, however,
gentlemen desired a furthei investigation, and
another repoit, he hoped no ñ lend of the academy
would inteipose the slightest opposition
Mr H4lRD1N considered this institution as
essentially necessary to the military defense as
the aim is to the body Theie was no specific
chaige alleged against it, and unless that was the
case, he believed the proposed investigation un
called foi If there was any blame in regard to
the appointment of cadets, it íes ted with mtmbers
of Congress, as their recommendations foi then
particular States were generally confirmed by the
Executive Department He concluded by mov-
ing to lay the resolution and amendments on the
table

resolution on the table, and decidí d in the nega-

of Kentucky,) and th re w ->s no man on eai th that
he would soonti ti ist He hid as much confidence
m the Milita y Committee as \\ y other committee
of the H rase but the sub]ect was on of so much
impoi'aiice, that he thought each State should
haveavnc rail If tht geiitl man fiom \t w

is light, why is he si anxioi s agun ti lcici the
subject to the Committee on Militaiy Allans It
had be n supposed tint the i evolution pi oposed to
abolisn the tcad my 1 his, wat, a mistake It
ni i ly pioposed an niq in v into its management,
which might or might not eventuate m a lccom
mendition that it should be abolished One of
hib colleagues [Mi   H\edi\J «as adveise to the
resolution, because nothing specific was alleged
He would furnish him and the House a specific al-
legation     One of the nearielations of that gentle
man (who was wealthy) had been appointed a
cadet in this institution, to the exclusion of othei
woithy and indigent youths
Mr MANN, of New Yoik.was in favor of
the proposed inquiry At the same tune he
wished it extended a little further—to make it as
extensive as possible He had no doubt of the
maladministration in the West Point Academy
He understood it cost the Government some five
oi six thousand dollars to qualify a young man
for the Army He was in favor of the general
punciples of the institution, but was opposed to
its abuses But he wished this inquiry extended
to another branch of the service He wished to
offer an amendment abolishing the office of Com-
mander in-Chief of the Aimy
The SPLAKER* reminded the gentleman that
such an amendment was not now in ordei, there
being then pending an amendment to an amend
meat
Mr MANNiesumed He would propose Ins
amendment at the proper time He would, how-
evei, remark, that the pay, rations, &,e , of tne
Commander in-Chief of the Army, was undei
stood to be about §10,000 He was fuendlyto
this officer, but he was unwilling that he should
receive a compensation so disproportionate to
that of other officers, and which greatly exceeded
the salaries paid to the heads of Depaitments
The SPEAKER reminded the gentleman that
he was indulging in a course of remarks not
then in order
Mr MANN continued In relation to the nn
mediate question befoie the House, he would, in
gtneial, piefei sending subjects to the appropii
ate standing committees As, howcvei, it had
been suggested that tne Militaiy Committee had
prejudged the case, he had no ob ection to a select
committee, but piefeired a smallei numbei than
proposed by the ougmal íesolution
Í Mi WARD was a membei o*" the Militaiy
I Committee which had investigated the s ibject at
I a foimer session If it was again to be inquired
into, he would prefer a select committee Theie
being no specific charges, the Militaiy Commit
tee would have no new ground of mq nry, and
they had already given to the subject the most
thoiough examination, and reported the lesult to
the House
The amendment of Mi Williams was then
disagieed to—yeas 76, nays 98
The question recurred on Mr Parker 's motion
to amend
A division  of the question being called for, it
was first put upon limiting the numbei  of the
select committee, which was lost—ayes 73, noes
j not counted
I     The lemaindei of the amendment, to stnke out
that pait of the inquiiy in íelation to the expedí
[ eney of abolishing the West Point Ae idemv, was
"lso negitived
!     Mr MA Vis, of New York, thenmoved to add
to the íesohition the follov ing amendment
I     "And that said committ e be also insti uct"d to
inquire into the expediency of "bolislnng the of   ,
fice of Majoi Geneial Commanding in Chief, and
apportioning moie equitably the pay, iations,anp
emoluments of the gi i eial offi eis of the \mvy
Mi SMITH said he was ei nelj n fivoi of
both the pi oposition contal led n the onginal
íesolution of the gentleman f om Kentucky, and
the pi oposition of th% amend til it olTeii d 1 y the

York will withdraw his amendment, and propose
his desired investigation in a distinct resolution,
I pledge him that my vote shall be given in its
suppoit As it is now presented, I trust it will
not be adopted
Mr WISE remarked, that under the Constitu-
tion, the President of the United States was the
" Commandei in Chief" He desned to kiow
whethei it was the object of the gentleman from
New Yoik to abolish the office of Piesident*
Mi M4.NN By no means The peison to
whom he alluded had assumed the pognomen of
" Commander in-Chief," and if the gentleman
from Viigmia would suggest amoie piopei term,
he would adopt it He was not in favoi of abol-
ishing the office of Piesident, although some gen-
tlemen might think it expedient
Mr WlbE suggested the term " General-in-
Chief," which was accepted as a modification,
when the amendment was rejected
The original resolution was then adopted by
the following vote
