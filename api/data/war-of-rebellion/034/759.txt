In answer to yours, General Burnside desires me to say you may impress horses, and then he wishes you to move up Morgan's flank, and harass him as much as possible. Be sure that the people in his front are directed to obstruct the road.

I have 2,300 armed men and 3,000 unarmed men; I have one piece of artillery; artillery in bad condition. John [H.] Morgan cannot get through Chillicothe; I have aroused the men in the country. I have ordered the roads obstructed in every manner possible. it will be done. I need arms-artillery, if it can be gotten here-and I will move out to intercept Morgan whenever he may come. My scouts cover the whole country. Shall I press horses? Men are pouring in from every direction.

Colonel RUNKLE, Chillicothe:

Get your men in cars, ready to start, and await orders. How soon can you be ready? I am expecting information from General Judah every minute. Ask operator to remain in office until I send orders. Judah must now be at Portsmouth with cavalry and artillery, with instructions to cut him off from Gallipolis. Telegraph any additional news you may get before you start. Let operator stay in office until you start. Is it positive the commanding officer at Piketon failed to destroy the bridge, and is Morgan's command crossing there?
