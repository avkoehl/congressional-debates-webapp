pressions practised by her chuich orders before the
revolution, has abolished hereditary peerages, and
in every respect greatly elevated and improved the
condition of her people. If a greater degree of
happiness among the mass of a country's popula-
tion, smaller burthens on its labor, and a more
general diffusion of prosperity through all ranks,
aflord proofs of greater freedom, then she may un-
doubtedly claim superiority over England m that te-
spect. Descended, as most of the people Of this
country were, from the latter; subject, to a gieat
extent, to the same customs, and ¡.peaking lie
same language, it was easy to account for this pre-
judice in favor of her institutions, which wis, he
ieared, too much on the increase. In his opinion,
the Republican institutions of America had more
to fear from that dangerous partiality to her insti-
tutions, which was constantly insinuating itself
through the channels of her commerce, herlaw,and
her literature, than from all other causes combined.
And not among the least dangerous symptoms of
the operation ot those causes, is the almost con-
stant reference to her as an example of freedom
He had no feelings of unkindness or dislike to
England, and while he could see much in hei cha-
racter to admire, he could see but little in her lorm
of Government, or its administration, that deserved
to be copied. A distinguished writer of this coun-
try, [Mr Cooper,] who had resided some time m
England, in a late work on that country, while he
asserts the existence of the most settled hate
among the higher classes theie to our free institu-
tions, rebukes, in a tiuly American spirit, the feel-
ings of subserviency towards hei which too many
of our citizens are in the habit of manifesting, and
particularly those who aie aspirants for lileiary
lame
In the Republics of Switzerland, which had
maintained their freedom longer and more steadily
than any other people of Europe, he believed a me-
tallic currency had chiefly prevailed When gen-
tlemen asserted that the hard money system had
existed in certain despotic Governments in Europe,
they forget to inform us that the banking system
exists also under the Government of the Russian
Autocrat, the most decidedly despotic of any oí the
great powers m Europe So far from tin I.un,
that banking institutions have existed only m free
countries, he doubted whether they had evei < \istc !
m any country at all, whose institutions deserved
the name of being called ftee, except in the United
States, where thev were rapidly preparing the ua\,
if not checked foi an essential change in the Go-
vernment. JTe challenged any one to produce a
"ingle exinple of a country in Europe, wheie
banks had existed, which was not, either in form oi
in essence, a monaichy or an an-tocrac , what
ever names they may have assumed.
On the question of the paper money system, a<!
being necessary to civilisation, he would only rrler
to the ancient lepubhcs, and more < specially to
the republics of Greet c Among them, he believed,
a gold and silver currency had prevailed, almost
entirely, and, in all the more noble aits ol ciuli/a-
tton, what people had ever excelled them, or, in
many respects, equalled them1 In sculpture, atchi-
tecture, poetry, and eloquence, the highest fruits of
civilization, their great examples, even at this day,
stood " ummitated, because inimitable " In mo-
dem times, what country had excelled France, in
all the noble arts of peace and war, nine-tenths oi
whose circulation is said to consist of gold and s¡|-
ver, the paper system existing there, to a very
shall and hinted extent, m comparison to her great
r'sourees In America, from the year seventeen
hundred and ninety, to eighteen hundred and six,
was precisely that period, when our advance m
wealth and improvement was gieater, perhaps,
than at any time since, and when goM and silver
constituted the chief currency It wa« tuie, that
the old United States Bank was, most of that lime,
in existence, and a few State banks, but that their
notes, he belie cd, weie in their cnculation, con-
fined mo tly to the commercial cities, and consti-
tuted but a small portion of the currency among
the people of the country, most of which was in
hard money This establishes the important fact,
that the period in our history, as a nation, which
was precisely that of our greatest improvement ,n
wealth and prosperity, was the pgnod when we had
the least bank papei, and the most gold and silvei
currency, in proportion to the amount of money m
cuculat on. That circumstance must forever put
to flight the absurd idea, that the present ciedit sys-
tem, as the banking syitem, which is now so uni-
versally in operation, is falsely called, h necessary
to the prosperity of the country. Opinions in oppo-
sition to the paper system, now so much derided by
those in iavor of it, weie not newv ófc the con-
tiary, they were the doctrines of $e|ne. of (be most
lllustnouj! Republican stats&men \a|¡ch this or any
other country has ever produced, and in all the
great qualities, which entitle men to íespect and
reverence, they would not, to say the ltast of it,
suffer by a comparison with an) ot the raembeis of
that party, Irom whom these rcpioaehes now comt.
It had been insisted on, m the (out>c of this dtbate,
by many gentlemen opposed to the picscnt bill,
that thi¡> countty was mainly indebted for hei great
piospenty to the paper system, and that, without it,
it vionld have been lar m the ieai oí its jiiostnt ad-
vanced condition Mi B said he should teel hu-
miliated, as a cili/cn oi this fiee Republic, it he
were to admit tint banking monopolies were the
gieat somccs of herpiospentj. Gentlemen, in their
gieat and eagci anviety to ascribe all the honor oi
these resu'ts to the paper system, had passed by
our noble institutions, based, as they weie, on equal
lights, had passed by our vvide-spreadimr and fei-
tile soil, which, by its abundant rcwaul of labor,
united mdustiy, and they seemed to (oiget, that the
gieat seciet ol our success, as a propio, is, that
labor is lightly btudened in all Us blanches, and
lis funis seemed, by run admirable loi m of Go-
vernment, to eveiy eiti/i n earning them, iiom the
highest down to the humble*! Gentlemen, in

try of the credit due t > it, i nterpiisc ol its achieve-

which belong to them, mil with a /oal little ele-

true political faith

cel, in its effects on the natural system, it is more

by the most pot' nt medicine
15m even if there were any eroutieis foi appre-
hending ineovciihiovv ol the system, of which there
was not the slightest, he shouhl be far from re-
garding it as a0rcat calamity, either in a political,
moral, oi lommcrcial point of view. Notwith-
standing the alarms that were constantly expiess-
cd, as to the (I stress and embarrassment that would
alten 1 the introduction of a general metallic our-
icney, he vcnluieel to e xpress the opinion, and was
convinced of it-, entire truth, that it would not, i/ it
were by a gratín il prriros, through a series of six
yeai" lor instance, began and completed, pioduce
as great changes m the value of property, and as
much embarra-sment, as follow one of those single
revuhiom, which take place penodically every
twelve or fifteen years in every country where the
paper system exuts For instance, in the disas-
ters of 1818 and 1837, occasioned by the banks,
who can doubt but they produced a greater sacri-
fice of individual fortune than a system gradually
introducing an entirs metallic currency would have
done? The loss, when once encountered, and it
would be, in his opinion, far less than is generally
supposed, would end with a single shock, arid
wouldbe followed by certainty and stability,in every
branch of business and trade. Noc so is it with the
paper system. It is followed by another, and yet
anothei, and is but a succession of shocks to pri-
vate credit and public prospeuty. It would be a
maltei of curious inquiry to estimate, as near as
practicable, the difference between the probable
losses occasioned to a nation by these periodical
disasters of the paper system, tor the space of a
century, and those occasioned by the more stable
ami uniform cuirency of gold and silver.
He would notice, briefly, a most gross delusion,
which it was attempted to propagate and impose
on the people of this countiy, m relation to the
quantity ol the precious metals, estimated to be
now in possession of the difleient nations of the
world It was no unusual thing to see statements
in the nevvspapeis of this country, opposed to a
fmther increase of metallic currency, declaring
that there was not, among all nations together, a
sufficient quantity of gold and silver to supply the
people of the United States with a currency ex-
clusively of that kind. Assertions equally m op-
position lo well ascei tamed facts on this subject,
but not altogether so grossly erroneous as that he
had just noticed, had been made in the progress of
this debate. Mr. B. said, that much imputation
and Hdicule had been cast on those who were en-
deavoung lo relorm the currency, by the liberal
use of the epithets impostuie, humbugs, and such
other classical phrases, not very much to his taste,
and m using which, he but iollowed the example
si t in a certain quarter. But he would say, that
those who had endeavored to make the erroneous,
impressions, m relation to the quantity of gold and
silver, to which he had alluded, had by far excelled
and outstripped all others, in the practices of
which they accused them, and were entitled to the
highest distinction* over all competitois, for then
achievements in the arts of humbugging He pro-
posed to dispel what, ho would again repeat, was a
most gross delusion on this subject, by referring to
the í.iformation furnished from sources entitled to
the greatest respect and authority, on questions of
finance and currency. Mr. Gallatin,, in his able
treatise on these question*, published in 1830, esti-
mates the whole amount ol gold and silver com
possessed, at that time, by the different nations of
the world, at the enormous amount ot between four
and five thousand millions ot dolíais.
.Agiccably to the same high authority, there was
then in circulation, from hand to hand, in England
alone, ihc sum of one hundred and fifty millions of
specie, besides the amount possessed by her banks.
It appears from i Ublc appended to the annual
report to Congievsof'he Secretory of the Treasury,
m„'rle in 18'H, that France alone h id, at that time,
five hundred and twenty-seven millions of dollars
in specie in circulation This document is based
on authentic data, derived from the best authorities
of that country. In his last annual report, the Se-
cretary of the Treasury estimates our whole circu-
lation in paper, throughout the "United States, to
have been, on the lust oí January, 1837, one hun-
dred and fifty-one or two millions oí dollars, andm
his annual report of 1836, he estimates'the amount
of specie tlacn in circulation to have been twenty-
eight millions of dollars, besides that possessed by
the banks The am< unt of paper money m cncu-
lation has been, since that period, greatly reduced
by the curtailments of the banks, and the amount
of specie in circu ation has, no doubt, been like-
wise much lessened He would, howevei, select
the two years he had just named as affording, the
one the largest paper circulation which had ever ta-
ken place in this country, and the other the largest
pecie circulation known in it, peihaps, in any one
year By adding the two together, they will make
the entire cnculation, in paper and com, about that
period, in the whole United States, one hundred and
eighty millions of dollars, a sum not much larger
than the amount of specie in circulation, from hand
to hand, in England, and very little more than one-
third as large as the entire specie cunency of France •
