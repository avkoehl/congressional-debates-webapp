Arrived here to-day all well. No news from the States yet. Met General Cox near Williamsburg, last night on his way. We had a hard march across the mountains, but brought all through safe. Will telegraph as soon as I derive any information.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,December 15, 1863.

Brigadier General A. J. SMITH,

Columbus:

GENERAL: Roddey, with his command, crossed the Tennessee River above Eastport on the 10th and 11th December, intending to go down the river and recross to Forrest at Jackson. Notify Admiral Porter.

It is important that you move as soon as practicable, taking the ridge between the Big Sandy and the head of the Obion and Forked Deer Creek, through Huntington, on Jackson. This will clear the water-courses and bring you within striking distance of Jackson on hard ground.

I have just received a howitzer battery (mountain) and will send it to you to-morrow. You must find the animals; the rest will be complete.

Orders have gone to McPherson to send you a field battery; but we can hardly wait so long. Your Tennesseeans will make good guides, at least.

Yours,

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
