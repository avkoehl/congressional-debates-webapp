General STEEDMAN:

The report from Dalton of 600 rebel cavalry being at Yager's Mills, seven miles west of Tilton, is not true. My scouts reached the mills, saw three, and could hear of only thirty of forty having been in that locality.

Major THOMAS T. ECKERT,

Asst. Man. U. S. Military Telegraph, Washington, D. C.:

Skirmishing sharply along whole line, with heavy cannonade from rebel battery on mountain. As usual, we hold some more ground than at morning. Prisoners and deserters say Johnston will attack us to-morrow, but that can hardly be true, and Sherman won't wait for him, but move on Monday to battle.

CIRCULAR.] HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Near Kenesaw Mountain, Ga., June 25, 1864.

As deserters are now arriving in considerable numbers, the major-general commanding directs that, until disposed of by courts-martial, they be kept always in the advance, at work upon intrenchments under a guard of tried and faithful soldiers, to prevent them from again deserting, either to the enemy or the rear. Each deserters will be provided with an intrenching tool, which he will be required to take care of. They will be habitually kept well up to the front, and when skirmish rifle-pits are needed they will be required to construct them. Care should, however, be taken that they do not go over to the enemy, and should they attempt that they should be shot at once.

By command of Major-General Thomas:

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff.
