Bvt. Major General A. SULLY,

Commanding District of Iowa:

GENERAL: The line of posts along the northern border of Iowa and Dakota settlements I wish you to establish at the earliest practicable moment. I suggest as the points to be thus occupied, first, Sioux Falls; second, Forks of Vermillion River; third, Mouth of Flint or Firesteel Creek on James River; fourth, Crow Creek; fifth, on the Niobrara River at the Keya Paha. One company of cavalry at each of these posts will be sufficient. Report to me on the subject immediately.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

The following dispatch from New Orleans just received. It has been confirmed by intelligence from another source. General Reynolds' cavalry is nearly all dismounted, General Canby having taken all the horses from Arkansas. Whilst Reynolds might defend the posts he occupies, he has no force sufficient to oppose Kirby Smith's advance, nor is there any force elsewhere in this command for the purpose. It is not known what effect Lee's surrender may have on this movement, but your immediate attention is invited to this dispatch:

The Montgomery papers say a gentleman just from Richmond, and a Member of Congress, informs us that General Lee has ordered Kirby Smith to move with his whole army into Missouri.

Our spies report that Kirby Smith is preparing to make the movement at the earliest possible moment.

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.
