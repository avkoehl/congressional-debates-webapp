32__________________APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GOLBE.___________Dec. 18S?,
25th Cono-" 2nd Sess.________    Suppression of small nates in this District—Mr. Wright.       ______________________Senafe.
Such had been the result in the other House. He
wished the Senate itself to proceed with the resolu-
tions. G( d grant they might have the effect de-
sired, but Mr P. wished his constituents to know
that he distrusted their efficacy The protection of
the South mibt depend on themselves Ho hoped
the resolutions would not be referred, it could do
no good, and would protract the discussion, of
which he was already hearaly wearied
Mr BENTON then withdrew the motion to
commit the subject to a select committee.
Mr. WALL said that he had hoped the subject
would have been referred to a committee, as it w as
clearly incompetent to the Senate to sit day after
day, making abstract creeds, and establishing par-
ticulai interpretations of the Constitution, all
which was foreign to the puiposes of legislation.
He would ask, on whom were these codes, cieeds,
and abstractions, to opeiate' They could have
no force whatevei as law, whom, then, would
they bind1! No one person whatsoever1 Did, then,
the Senate expect to settlt a thousand disputed
constitutional questions hj piopounding theories
and absti \ct pioposjhons' To legislate was the
duty of legis'"tois, nut tobroiohoi to promulgate
ihsinet opinions ind tVi nes If a law were
introduced on wo subj rt, he (Mi W) would be
able to act, oi,il the lepoit of a committee hid
come up, it ini^ht he lccened or rejected As u
was, however, the comse puisued app< aied to him
inegular, anomalous, and fiaught with bad ion c-
quences, convening the Senate into amere nena
ni theoretical disputations
Mr MORRIb then obtained the fine i, whin an
adjournment hems; moved unsuccess ully, aid i
two divisions, on a sugestión from Mi Webster
that, in couttsi to Ml \torns, who was loo indis-
jiused lu proired with liisremuks at this late horn,

In Venule, Tuesday, Drecmbu 9G   1817- On the 1 11
lestiaiiiing the is n< ol sm ill i otis in the DisIih t
of Columbi i
Mr WRIGHT lose and ¡inquired of tin Vi
Piisulenlif tin imriidment nilutd by the Stnitoi
fnin lllini is(Mt Young) h id bi tu adopted' The
answer was, thai it lntl bun adopted by the un i-
nimous consent of the Si nate He then said lu
had hoped not to be compelled again to trouble the
S"iiai" Willi any remaiks upon this bill, but the
charges against the committee which h id reporltd
it to the Senate were such, and so various, lhat it
seemed to be his duty again to notice them On
the last day of the session of the Senate, they h i '
proceeded fiom xanousquarteis, and thin partial!,
liom the Senator from Iii ntucky, (Mr < lay ) He
was himself a memhei of th it i ommittce, (ih
Committer on finance,) and had been h inow.1 ' \
the faénate with a i mspii uons plací u,ion it lie
had, upon that day, re p< lied some i f t u> e chaigi s,
but thej now came, with additons a d ag, <n i-
tions, fiom the honorable henatoi, (Mi Clay ) and
lie tnusl, therefoit., again repel thern.
He would do this by recounting, as biiefly .im-
possible, the chaiges which had been made, an I
the facts and history ol the bill, and i s progress
The Senate, upon an eaily day of the ptesent ses-
sion, he thought the 11th Decembei,byan express n -
solution, insnucted il e Commit ee on Finance to
consider the sublet oí ihe cud ncy in this Dis-
trict, and to repon su^h bills ,>s in the r judgment
ho ild be icq ired fo the impiovement thereof
T i^ íes ilnti n itae lied the co nmittee on the day
after Us passage There weie then bul thiee rami
bers of the committee in town, the memter fiom
Missouri (Mr Benton) from New Hampshire (Mi
Hubbard) and himself The membeis from ?T is-
sachusetts, (Mr Webster,) and from Louisioi'a
(Mi Nicholas) had not then reached the city Jnlhe
judgment of the members ol the committee presei t,
the suppression of the small, individual, and worii-
less notes, which were circulating as money m l-e
District, and especially m this city, was one indis-
pensable pie-requisite to the impioyemeatof the
currency In this, they supposed they were sup-
posed by the already expressed judgment of the
Senate, as a bill to accomplish this object had pass-
ed, at the sesoion of the Senate of September and
October last, without a dissenting vote. The thiee
members of the Committee, therefore, acted upon the
order of the Senate, and promptly repotted that
bill, in the wards, letters, and figures, in which it
had passed the Senate at its last session
They were not a little surprised, upon the very
appearance of the bill in the chamher, to find
themselves shaiply leproved by the honoiable
Senator, (Mi Clay,) and the propriety strongly
questioned of so few members ol a committee of
the body, in the absence of their colleagues, assum-
ing to report hills of so high importance, bills
touching the great and mteiesting subject of the
cunency of the country. An explanation was
then made, and the Senator requested to raise the
question he had suggested, that the sense of the
Senate might be taken upon it. This was not
done, and the matter tested until the bill came up
for consideration in the Committee of the Whole of
the body, on Pnday last.
Then, new charge' weie piefi ired against the
committee The\ had gone out of tin n way to
introduce this bill The\ hid eneio chid upon
the piovmee of miothei impoilant committee of the
body, that on the Distnct of Columbia These
chaiges wete met, the order ol the Senate instiuet-
nig the Committee on F nance to take up the
subject was produced, and the fact lhat the bill
was an exact copy of one which had passed the
Senate at its last session, in October, was again
stated
The Senator frmi Kentucky, (Ml. Chy,) how-
ever, then overstepped these tufting charges, and
announced to the Senate, and the audience, that
the bill was a "pica\une" bill, a tii/lnig afTaii, and
lhat the committee ought to be ashamed to have
introduced such <i measure befoie iIk Si n it< Mi
W. said he felt moiltlied and humiliated at a de-
claration of this sliong ihaiaotei coming fiom s,o
distinguished a source, from a Sunlor whose legis-
lative expernnio was sup nor to lhat of almost
m) individual m the country, whose si Hiding has
1 ma been such as lo give wi ight to his dpclarn-
tiinsheii ol elsewhere, and uhose sensi of justice
ou rh1 to lnoderati thus- die' h ttions upon all oc-
casions, and most espi cially «In n made upon this
lloor He could not fail to see the wide discic-
paney in the complaints against the committee,
eoming from the same soune, upon the two occa-
sions In the fust instance, ilwas an impoitant
bill, touching the «ieat and debíale question of the
cunency ol the country, and ought not to have
been reported without a lull committer, and in the
second, it was a six-penni business, of which a
committee of the Senate ought to be ashamed
Yet, so direct were the censure , and such the
weight of tin ir authority, that silence was imposed
upi u him and his oollm 'uc, and he felt bound
lo wait until Ihe so isr of thi S n.it< should
be e xpresseel upon the moa lire, befoie he cn-
t íely surrendei ^1 himself to s«lf condemnation
At the same tmc it was his duty to confess that,
censured as the eommiltee wire and from sueh
authontj,and trifling and six p'niiy inch naetei as
the measme was pionounced in o high iqnaitir,
jt was some consolation to his feelings to see the
interest and the spirit it elicited fiom the opposition,
to see that, humble and shameiul as was the bill it
opened the strongest baltenes from the opposing
benches, and drew forth their hottest and heaviest
fire
The elecisive vote, at length, came, and what
were the feebngs of rebel on the part of tbose
humble members of tue Cemmit'et on Finance,
who had thus ventured to gne hack to the Senate
a measure of its own, when they found lie tone
solitary vole against it1 Would it le doubted that
the#apprehens on of shame was at an end, and
the / were compelled to conclude that, a'l the high
complaints notwithstanding, thev had presented to
the body a salutary and acceptable bill'
Here he supposed all debate as to this much-
abused measure would have terminated, but the
experience  f the morning had shown his mistake
The honorable Senator (Mr Clay) had again come
to the assault, not upon the bill, but upon the com-
mittee, and had accused them of a culpable neglect
of the more important business before them, that
they might hasten on measures of oppression upon
this poor and helpless Distriot He had demanded
why the important bills of the session were not
brought forward, instead of this trifling mea-
sured
The honorable Senator had, in this instance also,
ran himself into an inconsistency of complaint
which demanded correction. His first charge was,
that the committee were arrogating powers unsafe
to legislation, by reporting important bills while
their number was not full. In addition to the
public explanation, made in answer to that charge,
a pi ivate one was made to the Senator himself, and
he was assured that the great public measures of
the session would not be pressed upon the attention
of the committee, until its members should have
arrived in town, and have an opportunity to attend
its meetings. He called upon the Senator to do
him the justice to recollect that this assurance was
given to him in person, and in his seat in the
Senete.
What, then, was the condition of the committee,
in this íespect, at this moment' The member
i rum Louisiana had arrived since the last regular
meeting of the committee, but the member from
Massachusetts, the great leader of that party,
whose interests the honorable Senator (Mr. Clay)
upon all occasions so ably and eloquently espoused,
had not yet reached the city. Were the members
of the committee, then, who were present, and es-
pecially those who had been piesent from the houi
of the appointment of the committee, to expect
this censuie for not having proceeded furtherm the
absence of this d stmguished colleague1 Were
they to have enteitamel this expectation, after the
(umplainis «Inch had been heaped upon them for
having simply leporled a ''picayune" bill during
Ihe absence of that member of the committee'
Was. he to have expected complaints of this cha-
racter from the veiy individual to whom he had
given assurances that the important measures of
the session should not be hastened in the committee
until the arrival of its absent members'! AH these
were questions which necessarily suggested them-
selves m consequence of the course which the
honorable Senator had felt it to be his duty to pur-
sue upon the passage of the bill under, dis-
cussion They were propounded to himself, to
the Senate, and to the countiy, and he, as a
member of that committee against which this
singular course of complaint had been pur-
sued, was willing to leave the answeis to that sense
of justice which governs the decisions of every up-
right man He would ask, however, and he would.
even make the appeal to the Senatoi himself,
whether it was just, whether it was fair, to put the
committee in the hopeless dilemma in which his
complaints had placed them' If they did act, to
complain of them for transacting important busi-
n< ss in the absence of some of their number? If
they did not act, to complain of them for neglect-
ing the impoitant business of the session' To cha-
íaeteri/e the same bill, at one moment, as an im-
portant measure touching the currency of the coun-
tiy, and thp next nnment, as a six-penny affair,
" a p'cayune bill," of which the committee should
be ashamed' In short, whether the committee ad-
vanced, stood still, or receded, to make their course
equally the subiect of such high censures'?
[Mi Cr ay, in reply, intimated that Mr Wright
had rcsfeel fe r ilajs upon remarks from him which
lie ha 1 chosen lo considei personal, although they
were not so intenled, and had now come forward lo
r ply to ft em He also urged objections to th
bill, and to the course of the committee m report-
ing it, because he said it was evident that, while
the terms of the bill limited its action to the District
of Columbia, it was intended that it should have a
much broader influence, and should discourage the
circulation of the descnptionSvjof currency upon
which it acted in the «urroundmg country ]
Mr WRIGHT rejoined He said the Senator
had entirely misconceived him, if he had supposed
he viewed any of his remarks of Friday as perso-
nal to himself, or intended, at this time, to reply to
them as such.   He had made the reference to those.
