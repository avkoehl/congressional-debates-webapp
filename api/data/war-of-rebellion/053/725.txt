River into Middle Tennessee, with about 2,500 cavalry and artillery. I expect to be joined by your command in the expedition. The trip is made at the request of General Bragg, who has been requested by General Johnston to order your command to join me. Should no orders be received, I will at least take that portion of your brigade near Tuscumbia, leaving scouts in that section for giving information. This communication is sent by Lieutenant A. B. Coffee, who has been sent forward to gain accurate information as to the different fords and such other points as will facilitate my march. You will please afford him every facility in your power.

I am, general, yours, respectfully,

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA, Dublin, October 2, 1863.

His Excellency President DAVIS,Richmond, Va.:

Major-General Ransom telegraphs me that he occupies Greeneville. The enemy retired quickly. It is reported they intend to make a stand at Bull's Gap. I do not think it advisable to push the troops General Ransom has farther into East Tennessee at this time. General Ransom has, therefore, in accordance with my instructions, ordered Wharton's brigade to Glade Spring. It will so move as to produce the impression that it is moving to Cumberland Gap, where I am informed the enemy have only about 500 men.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

SAM. JONES,
