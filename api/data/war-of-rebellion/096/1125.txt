[General LONGSTREET:]

GENERAL: With reference to the letter of General Cooper in relation to Anderson's brigade, I have the honor to state the following; On Wednesday of last week the same rumors reached me, and on Thursday I called General Anderson's attention to it, and directed an investigation, which was had that day, and resulted in eliciting thing going to show that the matter had ever been heard of even. To-day I have just concluded another inquiry into it, and with the same satisfactory result. One man of the brigade stated that he had heard that a number of men had signed a paper to leave when they were paid off; that was all. I cannot realize that any combination of the character the many relabel officers of the brigade, and they all express undiminished confidence nad faith in their men, nad pronounce the report made to the War Department a slander. Thee has been in this brigade some complaint nd grumbling at not being paid for many months. This want of money produces some privations nad inconvenience, and gives the soldier his great luxury-the means of grumbling.
