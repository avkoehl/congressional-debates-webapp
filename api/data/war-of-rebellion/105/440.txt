whole ofhis party toward the approach of winter, and to enjoin upoon himt he strictest economy in his expenditures consistent with efficeincy. The estimated expense of Lieutenant Mullan

s party was about or near $4,600 per month. The amount of the appropriation for th oad now in the Treasury subject to requisitin is $68,000. Lieutenant Mullan requested that the sum of $30,000 should be placed to his credit in New York. He will probably require:

3 assistants (civil engineers and clerk), at $125 per month.......................................$375

1 guide and interpreter, at $125 per month.......125

1 wagon- master, at $100 per month...............100

Total montly expense of party..................4,367

Expense of party for 16 months................70,000

Estimated cost of ourfit......................12,500

I beg leave to suggest that Lieutenant Mullan be instructed that the project submitted by him is approved, exceipting the number of assistants, w hich should be one less than be proposes, and excepting the employmeht of a phisician, if an assistant surgeon accompanies the escort; that the strictest econonmy be exercised by him in his expenditures, and that in no event should the amount of the appropriation be exceeded, a dnthat he will in his discretio winter with the whole party on the route, or reduce it upon the approach of winter or return and disband it at Walla Walla.

Veryr esepctfully, your obedient servant,
