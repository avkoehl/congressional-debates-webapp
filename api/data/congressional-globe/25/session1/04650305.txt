APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Postponement of fourth instalment—Mr. Jenifi
30#
er.
H. of Reps.'
deposite banks w«ulJ not ¿are attempt such an outrage, as to
refuse to make satisfactory arrangements with the States Let
Congress iefu*e to postpone the distribution of the fourth m
stalinent, and the banks will soon make the settlement with tne
States
Gentlemen charge the opponents of this measure with a tlis
position to embarrass the Administration of Mr Van Buren
Why should I desire to impede his policy? If the Administra-
tion pursue that course which accords with my principles and
views, so far I will sustain it, when it fails to do s©, 1 will op-
pose it If I were Capable of any other feeling, I should be un-
fit to be a representative on this floor No, sir, I will endea
vor so to act as to be just, and to have fair, honest, even hand-
edjustice extended to mj constituents
But, sir, let Congress refuse to make the deposites with the
States, as required by law, and justice will not be done Such
are the necessities of the country at this time, that unless some
thing be done, many of the States cannot, with any convenience
cany on their usual commercial intercourse The West and
Southwest usually supply the Atlantic States to the South with
stock during the fall of (he year, and such is the condition of
the currency at this time, that great peiplexity will be the
consequence The specie is all locked up, no United States
Bank notes, no western money, all belonging to the Govern
ment m deposite in the Wrsiem and Southwestern bank*?
Supply the States, distubute the fourth instalment, and they
will take the papei of those States in whose banks there is, as I
before showed you, a superabundance of ihe publn funds
Buts sir, this kind of talk, of the notes ol your deposite banks
being unavailable for the payment of the fourth liibtalment, will
not do You m ty make your " Globe" speak what it will hut
it will not "et aside the honest judgment of the people, especially
when they know you have done an act of injustice You cannot
deceive them much longer, it is out of the question to do it, and
it is lgnoiance oftneir intelligence to believe it
These bank notes, being put into en culi turn, would be great
relief to the people of the States, they will add to the circula
ting mrd um liante notes are the only means now in the hands
of thecuzens to transact their ordinary business It is idle, sir,
to attempt to justify this postponement by ti e allegation ol the
inconvertibility ofthe bank notes of the State institutions Yes,
«ir, the people are told that the country has been overcome by
distress, weighed down hyovei trading and speculation, and that
they ought tobe aided and assisted, they are told that the Go-
vernment has banknotes m great abundance —sol-ent, but they
ought not to be en culated, that specie cannot be obtained for the
States, and, therefoie, they must have nothing
Í repeat—let any repiesentative on this floor answer me—
are not bills of the deposite banks of every State of this
Union good1 Yes, they aie, and the people of these States
know it
Sir, there is another question coupled with this, that belong"
to the State  The \eiy moment you prorUim, thiou«di the
papen of this count v, that the banks aie indulged fiom the
payment of a debt, (which debt is a specie debt,) and tell the
people these banks that have the money have loaned it to spe
culatois to buy up the people's lands, as charged by the gentle-
man from Ohio, and have only notes for it endorsed by persons,
many of whom are important functionaries, they will fire with
indignation at this interposition of the Admmistiation, if the
fourth instalment be postponed
[Mr Hammi begged Mr D to give way for a moment Mr
H said he made no distinction between the banks West and
East He said that the banks had a large amount of public
money m their possession, and that they had loaned it out to
merchants and speculators He meant to draw no invidious
distinction between the banks East and thebankq West ]
Mr Dawson Yes, sir, I was not mistaken, nor have Í mi<=
represented the genth man
I repeat it asam sir, this v cry movement will scnmi-dy if
feet the Hate institution's It will--tab their p ipnlanty among
the people And have T notansht to íaise the Mus-e^tum
here1 I rail upon the hundí* ol the State*, the fneniK of the
rights of the States to mark it well TIip State banks must be
prostrated, say some gentlemen, and the fii^t step to seem e
then prostration is to make them the peculiar favorites of the
Government, by indulging them find making them unpopular
among the people This 13 the first step in the march Then
they ' will have the banks upon the hip, and will keep them
there," as the gentleminftom New York paid during the past
summer
If thia be the obiecM then mqune, Mi Speakei, will not
the postponement of the fourth instalment be an imn ense and
incalculable iniury to the Stale-? No doubt of it And, «ir it
will not expedí e the ie<mmption of specie payments "Why
«fit? let me e\p!ain The postponement earned, the bank1*
will sti'l resist payment What cue they1* The debt still et
ist=?, how aie they to pay iú They have not specie to do it
with, and he w can they do it if the Government continues to
require specie, which is a professed obftct of the postponement
and the indulgence''
To get the specie, thev mu-t curtail their issues , call in their
notes, by reducing then credits, thereby pressing their debtors,
decreasing the en dilating medium, and consequently increas
ing the rommeicial embankments, and, of course, depre
ciatmg the value of the ag-icultural productions of the conn
try
But, on, let the fourth instalment go to the State* , and these
difficulty wilt in some mearme, be avoided, the bank notes
will go into cnculaiion, and the people be aided, and to some
extent relived The bmks can then indulge then debtors
without apprehension, and ha* e no feai of the appi oaching day
when ^pene ah ill beieqmrcd en masse by the Government,
and I feel confi lent that this course will better suit the present
condition of affau*, and the e\is ma state of things thin any
other It will be an art of sheer justice to the whole, and
be, in my view, a paitul dischaige of the duty we owe the
States
Sn, if the monev were, absolutely lerpmen by the wants of
the Government I would vote foi this hill
Mr Speakei, I will not at this time go into the subject of a
divoice of this General Government fiom bmKs I will only
iay tint I havp my doubts both of its expediency and nrae'ica
bihty But, when the occasion arise", I bird! then be willing to
express my view upon it and m the meantime bhall give
uV subject my cal me* t dt bbei ltion
Then,sii m conclusion, I aver that this postponement will be
no 1 eliei to the Government no rebel to the peop'e bo', on
the contnry, inflicting an mpirv upon thi>m that the nie-yme
to giant indulgent e to the un palters i-a menuie which 1** loe il

having the deposite act of 1836 executed accoidin; to the m
tention and meaning of the Congress which passed it, puiiuant
to the requisitions of justice and equity
SPEECH  OF MR. JENIFER,
Of Maryland.
Tn the Bouse of Representatives^ September 27, 1837 —On
thebdltoposmonethe payment to the States of the fouiih
instalment of the surplus íevenue
The bill to withhold the payment of the fourth instalment
from the States having been leported from the Committee of
the Whole on the ¡State of the Union, without amendment-
Mr JENIFER, of Maryland, addressed the House lie com
menceil by saying that his remarks should be confined pi nu
pally to the subjects embraced in the following inquines, to
wit —
1    Tor what purpose was Congress called*
2   For whose benefit was the dcpoai e Jaw of June, 1S36,
pissed?
3   Can the demand  upon the Treasury be supplied without
withholding the fourth instalment fr un the States'*   And,
4   "What has given use to the present embarrassments ">fuV
country?
Mr I said he should not attempt to tb&uiss the que^tnti of
contiact, expíes ol oi implied by the deposite law oí IbJO
Tint question had been ably debated on both «¡ides in commit
tee, and wl atevet might be the decision to which the líou e
will come upon that point, he considered it of muth moie mi
poitance to asceitam whether the execution ofthtt hw or it
virtu-d repeal by the bill now on the table would opei ite mo
beneficially to the count'y
Was Congress called together at this e\iraoidm íry =<es ion
to take into consideration the state of the community at !<n e
and to adopt measures for its relief'
Or was it called ->o!i ly to íepleni h the Tie^uiy, it no mat
ter whit sacrifice to the interests of the States?
Wasit called to relieve the Government, and fmthei to op
press the people'
If the latter, then the object will be accomplished by the
passage of the bill now under consultation, and ->tlieis re
ported by the chairman of the Committee oi \Ya\s and
Means
I-, there a gentleman here ptesent fiom no mittei whit pnt
of the Umen, when he read the Proc'amation of the Pierdes t
of the United States convoking Cenares  who di 1 not IkIum

as well isihe C« ivtinment'1 to adopt mearme*, to lesioiethe
cuuency'1 to unite our exemons with those oi th° Lxecume
to stay the widespread rum pervading the whole countrj1
But now we are told that neither Congress noi the Executive
have any light to regulate the currency, that theie must be a
separation or divorce of the Government and the pecuniaiy
interests oí the people If this doctrine had been piactised and
if the Government had notas^umedallpowei ovci thecuruney
and had not attempted to regulate and give us a soundci and
better currency, then all might still have been well
But, Mr J asked, how long had it h^en since the Executive
yielded the right or the power to mteifeie with the [ emnniy
concerns of the commun ty, and to take underi s fu&ttrnu <<ii>
the mterestsof the banks,ot the mei chant« and of individual"'1
