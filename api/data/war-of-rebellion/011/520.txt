EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD ARMY CORPS,Corinth, Miss., May 13, 1862

General BEAUREGARD,

Commanding:

GENERAL: I had 13 men desert last night from the Twenty-third Tennessee Regiment. These men are from Lawrence County, which joins Hardin County, in which the battle of Shiloh was fought. It seems probable that they have made their way to the enemy. I have thought this fact of sufficient importance to communicate it at once.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant.

W. J. HARDEE,

Major-General

Colonel POLK,

The general wishes you to move up and relieve Lieutenant-Colonel Miller, who is at the forks of the roads above you.

General HARDEE,

Second Army Corps:

I send two men through, caught our pickets. You will find out from them that they expect to attack us this morning. Cavalry have been to the right of the Third Louisiana Regiment this morning, and have found out, I doubt, not, that that regiment can be easily flanked. There should be a regiment immediately placed at the crossing of the railroad by Farmington and Danville road.

L. E. POLK,

Colonel Fifteenth Arkansas Regiment.
