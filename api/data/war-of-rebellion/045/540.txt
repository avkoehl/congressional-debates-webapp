pike in Lee's rear, not knowing then that battle was over. I should have been two days earlier, and then such a move would have been of great service, even if the militia had been very roughly handled, which would probably have been the case.

WM. F. S. [SMITH.]
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 5, 1863.

General WILLIAM F. SMITH:

GENERAL: Captain West left here this morning. Our headquarters move at 6. 30 a. m. to Frederick. We move, to turn the enemy, via South Mountain passes.

The enemy, from all we can learn, is falling back on Chambersburg. His bridges at Williamsport were destroyed to-day by our cavalry, and a portion of one of his ammunition trains destroyed.

Hastily, your obedient servant.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS, Marsh Creek, July 5, 1863-9. 30 p. m.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD,

Chief of Staff.

GENERAL: My camp is on the south side of this creek, on the direct road from Gettysburg to Emmitsburg.

By an orderly returning to headquarters, I send information of my position, which I have thought would render unnecessary the presence of one of my staff officers at headquarters to-night.

I shall march at 4 in the morning, and expect to pass through Emmitsburg before any of the troops behind me can reach the rear of my column.

General Howard has communicated with me. He is on the Taneytown road, and will probably cross Rock Creek to-night.

No news of the enemy, and nothing of importance has occurred on my march.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant.

GEO. SYKES,

Major-General, Commanding.

General [BUTTERFIELD]:

From the order of march, I implied that I was to await General Sedgwick's instructions before marching, but from the last note received, I find he is at Fairfield, and that I am to move to his support, if required.

I have sent a staff officer to ascertain if he requires such support;
