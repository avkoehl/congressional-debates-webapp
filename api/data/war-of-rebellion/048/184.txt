In summing up results I find over 20,000 men, ten batteries and their horses, besides other horses, and more than 100 cars of baggage, &amp;c., have gone, being, in the whole movement, an average of 35 per cent. beyond the requisition and our expectations, and we only wonder that under such circumstances such results have been secured. I am glad to say, however, that every without previous notice, we feel ready to undertake it again, with all the anxiety and constant effort involved.
