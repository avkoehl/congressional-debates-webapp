HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION, March 21, 1865.

Brigadier General JOHN A. RAWLINS,Chief of Staff, City Point, Va.:

I would respectfully request to know whether under the provisions of Special Orders, Numbers 48, I am at liberty to permit family supplies to pass the lines I actually hold, under any circumstances. For example: I do ont hold Loudoun county, but have in my command two companies of cavalry composed of men from that county, whose families live in Loudoun and have been in the habit of getting supplies across the Potomac. The same is the situation in parts of West Virginia.
