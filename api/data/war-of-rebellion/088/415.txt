August 22, 1864-8.15 a.m.

Major-General ORD,Commanding Eighteenth Corps:

General Warren reports the enemy gone from his front. His pickets are moving up the railroad; his command will probably follow. The commanding general desires you to caution your command to great vigilance, as possibly the enemy may count upon finding some weak point in our lines.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Dispatch as to enemy leaving Warren's front received. They would find my line (I have but one) very thin, but all have been put on the alert.

I have but little confidence in my colored regiments, which are nearly depleted of officers from sickness.

Major-General.

The commanding general has no infantry to send you, but you can obtain some artillery by calling on General Hunt. The indications are that if an attack is made it will be directed against the position of General Warren, since a force is apparently being concentrated opposite to it. The commanding general understands that you will shortly be relieved by the Tenth Corps.
