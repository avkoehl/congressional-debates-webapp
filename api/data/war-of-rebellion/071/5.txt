HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA,Charleston, W. Va., July 1, 1864.

Major General FRANZ SIGEL,

Commanding Reserve Division, &c., Martinsburg, W. Va.:

Major-General Stahel should certainly be able with the large force under his command to protect the railroad and drive the enemy up the Valley. If more troops be, in your judgment, absolutely needed, you must telegraph for them directly to the Secretary of War. Sullivan's division is en route to Martinsburg, but you cannot hope for them before five or six days.

By command of Major-General Hunter:

CHAS. G. HALPINE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Near Martinsburg, W. Va., July 1, 1864.

Major T. A. MEYSENBURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have the honor to state for the information of the major-general commanding that there is no big spring near the Charlestown road three miles from Martinsburg. The only point in that direction where sufficient water can be found for men and horses is at the Opequon Creek.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JUL STAHEL,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Near Martinsburg, W. Va., July 1, 1864.

Major T. A. MEYSENBURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Martinsburg, W. Va.:

MAJOR: General Stahel directs me to state that there is no spring on the Charlestown road three miles from Martinsburg. He has therefore ordered a potion of the cavalry to Newcomer's Mills, on the Opequon Creek, about three miles from town. Pickets will be stationed so as to guard all the roads between Newcomer's Mills and the Winchester turnpike.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EZRA H. BAILEY,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
