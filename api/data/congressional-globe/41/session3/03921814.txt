Committee on Pensions, to whom was referred
the bill (H. R. No. 2220) granting a pension
to Mary Cunningham, to report it back with-
out amendment, and to ask that it be put upon
ltSTheS VICE PRESIDENT. Doesthe Sen-
ator from Maine object to pension bills being
considered?
Mr. HAMLIN. I object to everything that
is not regularly in order.
Mr. HOWELL. I hope the Senator will
allow me to pass this little pension bill. There
is no other time at which we can get these bills
through except when we report them. I ap-
peal to the Senator to allow me to pass this
bill.
Mr. HAMLIN. I shall be very much obliged
to the^Senator from Ipwa if he will allow busi-
ness to proceed in order, so that I can reach a
resolution on the table and have it acted upon.
Mr. HOWELL. It would not have taken
half as long to pass the bill as it has taken the
Senator to stand here objecting to it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Maine objects, and it requires unanimous con-
sent to consider the bill now. If reported now,
it must be placed upon the Calendar.
Mr. HOWELL. 1 hope to get it up again.
Mr. HAMLIN. I will help the Senator when
it is in order.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will
suggest to the Senator from Iowa that he can
do as the Senator from Ohio did, withdraw the
report for the present.
Mr. HOWELL. Very well; I will withdraw
it for the present, and offer it at some other
time.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The report is
withdrawn.
Mr. HOWELL. I have some other pension
bills to report, but I will not present them at
this time.

The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senatorfrom

Mr. EDMUNDS. I am directed by the
Committee on Pensions, to whom were re-
ferred the bill (H. R. No. 2222) granting a
pension to Maggie B. Miller; the bill (H. R.
No. 2299) granting a pension to Rachel Con-
kle; and the bill (H. R. No. 2330) granting a
pension to Catherine R. Roberts, to report
them back adversely. It appears that all these
ladies have already received pensions under
the general law; but it is due to them to say
that these pensions have been granted at the
Pension Office since the passage of these bills
by the House, so that there is no occasion for
action upon them.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bills will be
indefinitely postponed if there be no objection.
Mr. EDMUNDS, from the same committee,
to whom was referred the petition of Ellen
M. A. Troy, praying to be allowed a pension,
asked to be discharged from its further con-
sideration ; which was agreed to.
Mi'. EDMUNDS. I have also two favorable
reports to make on pension bills; but if my
friend from Maine objects to their being passed
now, I will not present them.
Mr. HAMLIN. I do.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Then I will not present
them now.
Mr. AMES, from the Committee on Military
Affairs, to whom was referred the bill (8. No.
1288) for the relief of the widows, heirs, and
legal representatives of Stephen Tipton and
John A. Sams, asked to be discharged from
its further consideration, and moved its indefi-
nite postponement; which was agreed to.
Mr. WARNER. I ask the Senate to take
up Senate bill No. 1185, to provide for the
appointment of an additional judge of the
district courts in the State of Alabama, and
for other purposes.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Maine [Mr. Hamlin] has made a general objec-
tion to anything being taken up out of the reg-
ular order.
Mr. WARNER. Then I give notice that
when it is in order, I-shall move to take up
that bill.
Mr. STEWART, from the Committee on the
Judiciary, to whom was referred the petition

against him for acts done in his official capacity

the Government, asked to be discharged from
its further consideration, the committee not
having had time to investigate it, and that the
petitioner have leave to withdraw his petition

Mr. NYE. The Committee on Territories,
to whom was referred the bill (H. R. No. 2940)
in relation to the fees and compensation of
United States attorneys, marshals, and clerks
in the Territories of the United States, have
instructed me to report it back without amend-
ment. It is a very short bill, and I ask that it
be put upon its passage.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Maine objects to any bill being put upon its
passage until Senate resolutions are reached.
The bill must be placed upon the Calendar if
it is now reported.

pose of considering House bills reported by said com-
mittees.

tion, and ask its present consideration:

posed it.
Mr. HOWARD. I object to that resolution.
Mr. DAVIS. I wish to make the resolution
comprehend all the Pacific railroads.
Ihe VICE PRESIDEN I1. The resolution is
objected to by the Senator from Michigan.
Mr. DAVIS. I am sorry that the Senator
from Michigan objects to light being poured in
upon the dark proceedings of these corpora-
tions.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The resolution is
objected to, and therefore is not subject to
debate.
