HEADQUARTERS,In the Field, October 24, 1864-12 m. (Via Paola.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

My pursuit of Price has extended down the Line road opposite to Paola. He makes rapid progress, but dead horses and other debris show his demoralized and destitute condition and my probable success in overhauling him.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

IN THE FIELD,

Near Aubrey, Four Miles South Little Santa Fe, On Line Road, October 24, 1864-9 a. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding near Independence:

Your dispatch of yesterday, 8 p. m., from Independence, just received. Price is in full retreat. My advance five miles ahead of me. You will save distance by leaving Santa Fe to you right. The pursuit must be pressed day and night if we expect to capture Price and his forces. Pleasonton is with me.

Very respectfully, yours,

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General, Commanding.

LITTLE SANTA FE, October 24, 1864-8.45 p. m.

Major-General CURTIS,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

I arrived here this evening and found three dispatches. Opened them, to see why they were left here, thinking they might contain news of military instruction. Smith's infantry, in consequence of being marched to Independence, will be late in getting up. I refer you to my dispatches of yesterday as expressing my views of the military position.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,October 24, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS,

Commanding Department of Kansas, in the Field:

GENERAL: I inclose a dispatch* from General Rosecrans. I do not think we can get any people in front of Price from our present forces to do any good at this time, as Smith is not up.

Very respectfully,

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General.
