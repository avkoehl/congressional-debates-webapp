I do not know whether you want these men with you, as I know nothing at all about the condition of affairs at Knoxville. I supposed, however, the more men you had there the better, if you can feed them, and, therefore, I suggested to General Whipple the propriety of sending these men to you, and sending them as a guard to a train when I found I could not get the camp and garrison equipage you wanted on a boat. The number of convalescents left in the camps of the two divisions here are as follows:

Command.	 Officers.	 Men.

Second Division:

First Brigade	 2	 85

Second Brigade	 1	 163

Third Brigade	 3	 107

Third Division:

First Brigade	 7	 195

Second Brigade	 10	 203

Third Brigade	 4	 129

Total	 27	 882

You had better send some instructions to Colonel Laiboldt at Loudon. Please tell Colonel Remick that I saw Colonel Porter, chief commissary of subsistence, to-day, and that I will do everything in my power to send up rations. The Chattanooga has not yet returned.

Truly, your friend,

J. S. FULLERTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, Tennessee, December 24, 1863.

Colonel L. D. WATKINS,

Commanding Brigade at Rossville, Ga.:

COLONEL: The major-general commanding directs that you postpone your expedition to Rome for the present and devote your attention to the rebel cavalry which is infesting the road from here to Cleveland via Harrison and the country thereabouts. There is a regiment of the enemy's cavalry reported at Ooltewah and the inhabitants in that region are all leaving their homes in consequence.

I am, very respectfully,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
