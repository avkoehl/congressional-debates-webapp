THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 5,
ject by the sweeping and indefensible asser-
tion that the cost of performing "the duties
which the franking privilege imposes" "ex-
ceeds the enormous sum of $5,000,000." The
correspondence that passes between the Exec-
utive Departments and their subordinates, and
between them and the public, must, under
any circumstances, be charged up to the ex-
pense account. The people will pay it whether
it shall or shall not be subject to regular rates
of postage. It is all the same whether they
pay the expense of transmitting it in the mails
and call it "free matter," or levy postage on
it and pay the bill out of the general Treasury.
No saving will follow the substitution of the
one rule for the other except on the theory
that the official frank gives respectability to
a multitude of frauds.
It is a laudable ambition that stimulates the
Postmaster General to elevate the character
of his Department by making it self-sustain-
ing. Most willingly will this House uphold
him in the attempt; the people will sustain
him, and the result accomplished will secure
for him the gratitude of the whole country.
He holds his position to-day on the promise
of his party that the revenues should be hon-
estly collected and economically expended.
He controls the disbursement of millions of
dollars. He presides over a Department dis-
tinguished for its habitual insolvency. He
proposes to lift it out of its " chronic bank-
ruptcy" if the franking privilege be abolished,
and to his appeal for help this House has done
all it could to afford him the desired oppor-
tunity. Nothing remains to be done, unless
it is to reduce the appropriations of his De-
partment to correspond with the amount he
proposes to save, and thus leave him unem-
barrassed to work out his proposition.
Let members of Congress and all others of
the "privileged class" become contributors to
the postal revenues; let official correspondence
no longer be dead-headed ; let the mail bags
be closely locked against all matter that comes
without a ticket of admission, and at the end
of the first fiscal year we shall be able to judge
of the accuracy of his calculations. But let it
be borne in mind that what he derives from
postage on official correspondence does not
represent a saving to the people. It will im-
prove his balances, but not those of the general
Treasury. It will at last be the withdrawal of
money from one pocket for introduction to the
other—the robbing of'Peter to pay Paul.
The Postmaster General has made good use
of the opportunity afforded him, in presenting
his annual report, to communicate his views on
this subject. It evidently prompted the action
this House has taken. -That much good has been
accomplished, notwithstanding his erroneous
statements. If he did evil that good may
come of it, the end has justified the means.
My purpose is not to quarrel with his recom-
mendations, but to present the facts side by
side with his statements, and leave the House
and the country to judge of their respective
merits. That no injustice may be done him,
I will quote a few paragraphs of his report. I
begin by presenting the following:
" The cost of "free matter' has been increasing from
year to year, until at last it weighs down the Depart-
ment into continuous insolvency, The additional
expense to which it subjects theservice is countedby
millions, while there is provided to meet it only the
standing annual appropriation of $700,000. It was
stated ten years ago that the Department actually
expended at that timo, in the performance of the
duties which the franking privilege imposed, little
if anything short of $3,000,000. Since that time the
expense has largely increased; and I am convinoed
that it now exceeds the enormous sum of $5,000,000,
of which about one half is paid on fraudulent mat-
ter. That this is not an exaggeration will appear
lrom an examination of the weight of mail matter
sent and received at the Washington city post office
from the 11th to the 31st January, 1869, as officially
reported to the Department, By this return it ap-
pears that th  weight of free letters sent was 15,385
pounds, and of free letters received 16,995 pounds,
rr days 52,380 pofinds. Hence ai
!'r one month is 48,570 pounds, and an
Haf> ye?r,pounds. It appears
twentv I ® of Public documents for
y days was pounds; making for on© 1
month 311,837 pounds, and an aggregate for one year
of 3.742,044 pounds. If, therefore, the postage value
of this free matter be computed at tho minimum esti-
mate? of $125 per pound for letters and sixteen cents
per pound for documents we have a postage value
for Ireo letters of 8738,550, and for public documonts
S598.727, being an aggregate of$l,337,277, as indicated
by tho returns madv; at a period when the mails were
almost entirely relieved of the burden of the heavy
departmental reports. All this from the Washing-
ton city post offico alone.
To his astonishing figures is here added the
startling assertion that it costs the Government
over two and a half million dollars to carry
fraudulent matter in the mails, protected by the
frank of "the privileged class." If this is so
no honest man should sleep until the remedy is
applied and the cure effected. To prove "that
this is not an exaggeration," he refers to a par-
ticular test applied to the mails at the post office
in this city during a part of the month of Jan-
uary oflastyear. Congress wasthen convened,
and the labor of loading the mails was no doubt
industriously performed. He is careful to state
that the experiment was tried "at a period
when the mails were almost entirely relieved
of theburden of heavy departmental reports"—
at a time when nobody but Senators and Repre-
sentatives was sending and receiving anything
but ordinary correspondence—and as a con-
sequence this prodigious pile of mails, one half
of which was fraudulent, was almost exclu-
sively covered by their frank. It is a sad com-
mentary on the honesty of that Congress, but
a source of soothing reflection to him and me,
that such frauds were perpetrated after he
ceased to be a Senator and before I became a
Representative.
Taking these figures as a basis, we find that
no less than 1,036,160 free letters, at the rate
of one half ounce per letter, were received and
dispatched at the post office in this city during
the twenty days mentioned. The Congres-
sional Directory informs us that the member-
ship of that session was sixty-six Senators and
two hundred and thirty-two Representatives
and Delegates. On the supposition that only
one half of these letters came and went under
their frank, we find that they received and sent
off what was equivalent to 518,080 letters in
all, or 1,738 each, during that period. Each
of these gentlemen sent out and received a
fraction less than eighty-seven letters daily; full
four times the average that the highest reliable
estimates would justify. And each of them
must have franked 697£ pounds of public
documents during the twenty days, or at the
rate of930pounds per month and 11,160 pounds
per year ; which is 3,147 pounds more than he
received during the two years of his term, as I
will soon show by a copy of his account for
that period. And this return was made for a
period of twenty days in the early part of the
session, before public documents had fairly
begun to come from the printing office; which
assertion I am justified in making by the fact
that thirty days after that time only 40,000
copies of the agricultural report for 1867, which
book made up nearly one half the weight of
documents furnished by that Congress, had
been received from the Public Printer out of
the 180,000 volumes due the House. I learn
this fact from the superintendent of the folding-
room.
Perhaps it is discourteous to question the
Postmaster General's figures. Of course I
would not do so. They were " officially re-
ported to the Department," and are therefore
stamped by the impress of accuracy. If by
accident they were incorrect, the present chiaf
of the postal establishment is not responsible
for it; they were reported to his predecessor.
That gentleman, so reliable in his politics, so
reliable in his fidelity to his party, so unexcep-
tionable in all his official conduct, could not
err in figures or permit others in his employ
to do so. Therefore, these figures were cor-
rect. They seem to be large, but then nearly
all the matter that was covered by the frank
of members of that Congress may have got
into the mails during those twenty days. We
might suspect that the weighing clerk made
some mistake if we did not know that his fig-
ures were " official " and that half lie weighed
was "fraudulent." Some trace can yet be
found of the genuine matter that went out that
month ; but gentlemen so lost to all sense of
propriety as to send one pound of unlawful
matter with each pound of genuine -would
conceal too well to let us know when, where,
or how they obtained what they were forbid-
den to send by the terms of the law and the
solemnity of their oath. The easiest way no
doubt is to accept the figures and confess their
force.
But, Mr. Speaker, I propose to challenge
them. I propose to show, partly by actual
figures and partly by reliable estimates, that
if such an amount of mail matter got into
the post office in this city in any twenty days
of the term of the last Congress it was largely
in excess of what was sent for any other pro-
portionate period of that term. I have before
me a statement of the number and weight of
all the documents delivered to each member
of the Fortieth Congress. It was prepared by
the superintendent of the folding-room at my
request, who easily ascertained the number of
books furnished each member by turning to
. his account, which was a duplicate of all the
others, and the weight by putting a certain
1 number of volumes of each kind on the scales,
and from the result thus obtained, calculating
the aggregate weight. It is as follows :

This statement was made out in the folding-
room of the House. I have another, giving the
weight of all the documents delivered to each
Senator, which I cannot take up time to read.
It shows that forty-seven pounds less of public
documents were delivered to each Senator than
to each Representative during the last Con-
gress.
The postage on these documents at the rate
of sixteen cents per pound would have amounted
to $1,282 08, and their distribution was scat-
tered over a period of two years, or at the rate
of $641 04 to each member for one year. The
correctness of this statement cannot be dis-
puted. Let me now resort to estimates ; and I
beg gentlemen to correct me if I shall under-
state them. Let ns suppose that each member
under cover of his frank sent and received
thirty letters at the single rate, or three cents
each per day, for every day in the year ; six at
