some empty wagons in that region with flour and take them across to the Sperryville Valley. These may reach there in time to supply you, provided you cannot obtain enough elsewhere. I need not suggest to you the importance of causing every attention to be paid to your artillery and wagon horses, for, as little or no grain can be procured, it will be impossible for them to stand hard work without the utmost care and relief from all superfluous weight. I have advised General Jones and General Robertson, who are picketing on the Shenandoah, to give you all information which may be of importance to you. Should I receive information which may render it necessary, A. P. Hill will follow you on Tuesday morning. Please give instructions to keep all the mills going in your route, so as to supply flour to the other troops. I have directed a pontoon bridge to be laid at Front Royal, and you had better send an officer forward to see its progress.

Should you determine to cross at Ashby's Gap, you must order it to you.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA,Dublin, July 19, 1863.

Colonel ROBERT L. PRESTON, Central Depot:

The enemy was so roughly handled at Wytheville that they commenced leaving last night, and retreated toward Tazewell Court-House.

I am just now informed that they are moving from Crab Orchard down Walker's Creek, it is thought, on this place or New River Bridge.

Please keep your men together, and take command, as senior officer, not only of them, but of all troops at New River Bridge and the Central Depot, excepting those under Major H. Grey Latham. Make such disposition as you best can for the defense of the bridge and depot. If you are in want of ammunition, call on me for it.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
