HEADQUARTERS LIGHT DIVISION,November 3, [1862]-5.20 p.m.

CAPTAIN: One brigade and a squadron of cavalry advanced down to the ford this evening, apparently with the intention to essay a crossing. I had Archer's and Pender's brigades and Pegram's and Latham's batteries there, under command of General Archer. They handsomely repulsed the enemy, and when I left were taking off their dead and wounded, under a white flag. I have added Brockenbrough's brigade to the picket to-night, and sent a picket to Shepherd's Mill, some 4 miles above Castleman's Ferry. Major White gallantly held his position on the other side, and preceded the enemy so closely that caution had to be exercised to prevent exposing his men. I directed General Jones to leave at 2 o'clock. I have not thought it necessary to call upon him.

Respectfully,

A. P. HILL,

Major-General.

Captain A. S. PENDLETON.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
