HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Crawfish Spring, September 18, 1863-11.45 a.m.

Major General THOMAS L. CRITTENDEN:

The general commanding directs you to move General Van Cleve's division in the vicinity of Gordon's Mills and close it up on General Wood's division. Post General Palmer's division in General Van Cleve's present position, and hold your whole command in readiness for any movement. The enemy appears to be making demonstrations on your left.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General, and Chief of Staff.

GENERAL PALMER'S HEADQUARTERS, September 18, 1863-12.30 p.m.

[General ROSECRANS?]:

GENERAL: General Palmer has notified General Negley that he will leave his present position at 2 p.m. General Palmer's grand guards will not be removed until properly relieved. No demonstration on General Palmer's front so far. As I came out I think I heard brisk firing on Colonel Barnes' front. I did not like the position of this brigade on yesterday. General Palmer will make it right as he can.

Very respectfully,

ARTHUR C. DUCAT,

Lieutenant-Colonel, and Inspector-General.

HIGH POINT, September 18, 1863-12.30 p.m.

Captain MERRILL:

Large bodies of cavalry and, I think, infantry at a point 12 degrees south of east, filed, I think, on the State road, and then marched north. Dust and smoke are increasing in the east. Do not know whether friends of enemies.

MEEKER.

Conjectured to be our own troops.

J. S. FEE.
