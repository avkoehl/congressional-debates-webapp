will be at once c ancelled when their accounts shal
be finally settled In some cases suits have bpen
ordered, and the sums justly due have been se-
cured. And from the information which I have
been able to collect, of this sum of §476,533 80,
not more than twenty thousand dollars will eventu-
ally be lost to the Government.
Among the defaulters, the name of Wiley P
Harris, a late receiver at Columbus., Mississippi,
is entered at the sum of §109,178 08, and this,
item makes up a part of the six hundred thousand
dollars which the Government has lost within the
last two years through the default of public offi-
cers, according to the statement of the Senator
from Virginia, and yet the explanatory note shows
that this particular demand has, m pait, been
paid, and the balance perfectly well secured
In the case of James W Stephenson, a late re-
ceiver at Galena, who is recoided a= a defaulter to
the amount of $74,859 70, the whole sum is secured
to the Government.
In the case of Governor Call, of Florida, who is
recorded asadefaulter to the amount of #43,408 54,
he is prevented by his public duties from si tflmg
this account at the Department, and in canceling i
averj item of claim                                                 j
I would allude to other cises, showing that this
document is but a transcupt liom the books the ol
Treasury, and that the table* do not exhibit llu true
state of Ihc account-, between the public officers and
the Government In the case of Tohn Taylor, a
receiver at Cahawba, and for the faithlul perform
anee of whose duly, my friend from Alabara i (Mi
King) was responsible—he stands iccordul as a ele
faulter to the amourt ot §11,115 20 And yet, m
a suit against the administrator to recover this
balance, judgment was rendered in favoi of the de
fen dint
Benjamin J Chambers, late receiver at Little
Rock, stands recorded as a defaulter, and vet the
money has actually been paid over to the District
Attorney, but then these accounts have not actu ill}
keen «ettled upon the books ot the Treasury, and
nothmg could be more uncertain and deceptive than
to take these tables unexplained as evidence of the
state of the accounts between the receivers and the
Government Yet, by a relcrence to the notes oí
explanation contained m the simp document, and,
also, by a reference to the Depaitment itself, in
formation, cci tain and satisfact irj, could be oota n
cd with reference to the lecoided list of public de
laultcis

Mr President, I thank the honorable Scnaiors
for the information they have imparted, it si ovvs
that the view I had taken was correct W( lia\e
no land offices in New England But it occurred
to me that these ícccivcrs, holding portions of the
public money, must be diawn upon from tim  to
time by the Tieasury Dppaitment and thit the re-
turn of the sales of the public lands would give no
certain mfortnati m as to he true «tale of the pub-
lic accounts with those land officers, notwithstand-
ing the accounts are made up at the Department

On the fust i   ATn    it          ant ci, atng the tbir'
nist lmcnl *o bo t ui i i el to the States, there
were m the deposite banks over twent}-eight mil-
lions of dolían. Tins sum was cnarged with the
expenditures of the Government, and these oxpen-
dttutes were to be made, contracts had been cnteied
into, the appropriations for specific objects were ne-
cessarily applied to those objects, the Government
went foi ward, and notwithstanding the failure of
the public depositories, and the control |of the
public funds was theieby placed beyond the power
of the Government, vet the embatrassment, the in-
convenience,, and the actual loss resulting fiom
such a state of things, must be visited upon tlje Go-
vernment, and that loss may be laiily estimated by
ascertaining the actual difference between specie
and the kind ot cunency in which the. Government
was compelled to make its disbuicements. That
difieience has been, on an aveiage, at least fivejper
cent, and the Government, m making its disburse
ments, although the public funds were nominally
pas-seel at their pii value, vet contiactois mint have
calculated for the depiee lauon m the currency
tn all the supplies m ule, m all the mattnils
found, and m ih the sou ices performed, the eh f-
feienee between a cunency eijuivilent to specie,
and a depiectat-Hl papn cunencv., e lite led into the
calculation m elett i mining the value of such sup-
plies, and m fivin^ the woilh of stuh Iaboi This
dillerenct was indeed a lo ¡> then to the Govern-
ment , and up< n the actual sum then in deposite m
the selected haul s th it loss could not have been

to this the. vexi ion and embanassment which the
Government must have suffeied bj reason ol the
fulmc of these public depositories—and, as a
tutthti consequential loss, the whole expe ises of
the late extia session of C ingress

evno=e sucn tiarsaclion    It was the act of the di-
rectors of the Commonwealth Bank which gave to
their lavored associations the use of the whole capi-
tal. Nor does the capital of these local institutions
furnish any ground of security or of confidence.
The known vigilance, fidelity, and uprightness
of the managers of these State institutions, can
only inspire confidence  and give security. The
character and acknowledged responsibility of the
customers of a bank, adds much to its credit with
the community.
The Senator from Virginia has remarked chat
by his substitute, every inducement, is taken away
from the local banks to make use of the public mo-
ney If then these institutions are not to derive any
advantage by the use of the public funds, for what
pui pose make the deposite with them? The accom-
modation the measure will afford to these institu-
tion , has induced the Scnatoi to offer his amend-
ment And m no way can the interest of the banks
be directly promoted, except by appropriating, for
a time, to their use and for their heneflt, the funds
of the Government.
The Senatoi has remarked that the limitation
ol local bank capital will check these institutions
from imprudently extending their discounts.. I can
assuie the Senator that this fact will afford no suffi-
cient guard "All banks trade on the average
amouut of the deposites confided to them, which is-
ascertained by cxpenence," and as it respects the
banks, this very tride upon deposites, whether pub-
lic or private, has been the source of great embar-
lassment It is a most dangerous experiment, and
vet it has been done, and will again be done, if op-
poitunity occurs This trade upon public and pri-
vate, deposites by the banks—this mixing the reve-
nues of the Government with the moneyed means
of these corporations—has been the immediate
cause oi the calastiophe which has befel those m
stitiuious, and oí the consequent d stress which now
perv ul"s the country
The Senator was undeistood to say that the pub-
lic money might propeily and safely be put out on
loan by these de posite banks, that if banks are em-
ploj cd as the fiscal agents of die Government, it
would be no more than reasonable to allow them
the puviltge ol using the public money, that sucha
piactice would promote the convenience of the
various classes of the community
In this way, Mr President, the Senator would
most effectually (through the agency of his hill)
give directions to the public funds for banking pur-
poses although his bill would not, m terms,
establish a Government bank, yet the whole pecu-
maiy means of the Government would constitute a
"capital" for banks to vvoik upon This is one of
the very evils which the Senator discovered m the
bill oí the c imnuttee—that it went to create a Go-
vernrncni bank, and lo place the public revenues
under the conlrol of the Executive for banking
operations, and yet he would deposite those reve-
nues with local banks, with an avowed assent to
thun tocairy on their banking opeiations by the
uel of these public funds I enter my piotestagams
Hie whole policy
The Senator from Virgma uiges the adoption of
his amendment as a relief measme, and objects to
the bill reported by the Committee on Finance,
because it is not calculated to afford any relief to
the country That th  Government, as calm as a
siimme r's morning, looks out upon the raging storm
I would tksite, Mr President, to ¡earn from the
.Senator what relict measute within the competency
ef Cong] ess, which has not been proposed, can be
pnsentel
The Se natoi from Massachusets has very dis-
t n tly ^evea t > ihe Senate his opinion, that the íe-
chaiterof a ]Nc>tional Bank can alone regulate the
? ntral cunency of tV couetiy, and that the cx-
l tin deiaugment of the cunency is the source of
t^e vvhr Ic evil
