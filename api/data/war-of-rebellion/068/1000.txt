Honorable J. A. SEDDON:

The cavalry that cut and destroyed the railroad here last night left here early this morning; said to be about 3,000. They took the Buckingham road, which leads to Appomattox bridge, Richmond and Danville Railroad. They gave out here that they were going to Huguenot Springs. I expect to follow and see which direction they take and will telegraph you.

POWHATAN, May 13, 1864.

Honorable J. A. SEDDON:

I arrived here 5 p.m. Telegraph line between Powhatan and Coalfield badly torn down. Have repaired it up to this point. About 1 mile of it down here, which will soon have up. Railroad track torn up and buildings destroyed. Spear's cavalry left Buckingham road a few miles above the pits, and crossed railroad the second time, 17 miles from Richmond. They have gone on to Mattoax Bridge. Considerable firing heard there this evening. I will go as far as that point if possible and report from there.
