ments, the couits ha\e awaulod the lull amount

it is just to allow some icmuneraiion loi extia sei-

that compensation b> law 1 would by no means
recommend mat any allowance should be made lor
disbursing the usual and ordmaiy appropr atious

tra duties are imposed upon officeis, involving
great risk, from circumstances beyond their control
and against which no human precaution can pn-
tect them, it appears equitable tnat some comfit li-
gation should be allowed, which on every account
  would be better to fix by law.

I beg leave to submit the following repoit
Within the year past, the repans of the Cc lam-
bus, Ohio, and Delaware ships of the line, halt

vama has been launched, and her equipments so
fax advanced as to be nearly ready to proe oed to
Norfolk, where they will be compiled The Erie,
Jehu Adams and Ontano «loops of war have been
repaired. The steamer Fuiton « ith her engines
and machinery is nearly fit f< r service Two
sloops of war, to be called the Cyane and Levant,

The squadron in the Mediterranean consists, of
the frigates Constitution and the United States, and
the sohoonci Shaik This is less than the Usual
foi ce upon that station, but is deemed adequate to
the present esigcnciesoi our commerce in that sea,
and as vessels were much wanted loi olhei su>.
tious, none have been st nt to th it since the ictuin
of the Potomac and John Adams
The lngite Constitution must be íecalled m

tion can be conveniently male to tins squadum,
and the ship ol the line Peiiiisylaiua sent to that
station, should it lv doi mtd i \pidunt

This is a considerable addition to our force on

The West India squad ion has bt t n most activity
and efficiently employed m th< compliealed duties
of protecting the persons and piopcrty ol our mei-

foices in the I'londa wai, and of preventing the
importation of slaves

from New Yoik in April, 1835 on a cruise m the
East Inri es, an I ¿¡on  t ¡c coast of Asia, with a
view to the pultctim md t \te ision of our eom-
meiei  in tin quirk r, ittnined to the United States
on ih' ifith oí O tohir list, having successfully
actomplishul ihe objects foi wlreh ihc cruise was
undertaken Ihe Entcrpnse was detained by
Commodore Ballard on the Pacific sta'ion, where
her services were required
Commodore Read,  with the frigate Columbia
and the sloop of war John Adatfts, is ordered u>
perform a ci tuse in the East Indies, aud is expected
to {.ail m a few days. A part uf his crews are de-
tained a «holt tune, to assist tn. taking the ship
of the line Pennsylvania from Philadelphia to Nor-
folk.
For the purpose oí protecting oui commerce and
suppiessmg the si ivc Hade on ihe coast of Africa,
our ships ol war have been occasionally ontered to
touch n( the sctücmeix  on that coast. The most
lecent visits to thisc have been made by the ling
Dolphin, on her passage out to the coast of Brazil,
and bj the irigaiePou mac, on hti return from the
Meditci ranean to the Untied States. These visits
have given the highest satislaction lo the colonists
on the etnst, and will no doubt bt attended with
benefitul results
