1860.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
reach this point as the waters of yonder Potomac,
in their course, will reach the Chesapeake Bay.
The Republican party will oppose these present
and prospective schemes, by which the rich freight
of precious interests secured by our form of Gov- .
ernment may be precipitated in ruin, and it will
seek to correct the public sentiment of the South
in respect to its own doctrine, so "wickedly per-
verted by those in position and power. It will not
only do this, and stay the march of slavery into
the common Territory, but it will undertake to
correct the financial mismanagement and abuses
which have assumed such gigantic proportions
under your administration of public affairs. We
shall strive to lessen the present enormous and
profligate expenditures, establish fairness in the
dispensation of patronage, and secure perfect fidel-
ity and honesty with all the officers and agents of
the Government.
* No one can complain of this, except upon the
principle that he who disturbs the peace shall
nave full license to destroy it; that he who rav-
ages a portion of our inheritance shall be at liberty
to pillage and lay waste the whole; upon the prin-
ciple that the highwayman who takes your purse
shall be entitled to your raiment and food.
The Democratic party ha^ffe exercised power
corruptly, as the record shows. They have not
only abused the trust which free labor committed
to them, but they have rioted upon their sub-
stance, and wrested from them their fair, equal
privilege in the political advantages, honors, and
emoluments under the Government.
Let us see if this is not as I have stated; and I
may here remark, that I am led to the following
investigation with increased desire, because of the
partial statements, or omitted tables, in the com-
parisons drawn by the honorable member from
Mississippi [Mr. Barkspale] a short time since.
The population of the South is scarcely more
than half that of the North. Since the organiza-
tion of the Government, there have been eighteen
elections for President, in which the candidates
chosen were twelve of them southerners and slave-
holders, and only six of them northerners, four
of which six stood upon a southern platform; that
no northern man lias ever been reelected, while
five of the southern men have; or, in other words,
that out of the seventy-two years of Federal ad-
ministration closing with Mr. Buchanan's term,
southern men and slaveholders have held the reins
for forty-three years, or more than two thirds of
the time, and have directed them a greater part of
the'remaining third.
In all the other departments of the Federal Gov-
ernment, the South has enjoyed the same ascend-
ancy. It has had seventeen out of the twenty-
eight judges of the Supreme Court; fourteen out
of the nineteen Attorneys General; sixty-one out
of seventy-seven Presidents of the Senate; twenty-
one out of thirty-three Speakers of the House;
and eighty out of one hundred and thirty-four
foreign ministers.
The Senate of the United States consists of
sixty-six members—representing fifteen slave,
and eighteen free States; the free States have a
white population of about eighteen million, the
slave States have a white population of about
eight million. The Senate have twenty-two com-
mittees; and, m fairness, the free States ougli, i.o
have a preponderance proportional to their num-
bers and power. How stands.the case in the ar-
rangement at the Senate the beginning of the pres-
ent Congress ? The chairmanship of sixteen is
given to the slaveholding members, and the chair-
manship of the six others to members who side
with them in politics. Not a single committee
of any importance is assigned to the free States,
either ifi the chairmanship or in the majority of its
members. The Republicans, who have twenty-
five representatives in the Senate, or considera-
bly more than one third of the whole body, arc
allowed two members on each committee of seven.
Could anything be more sectional than this >
Now, can any one say that this is altogether
fair? I behove I am authorized to say that the
people of the North regard it as .an unjust and
invidious discrimination; and, because they have
determined to take these matters in hand, the
South should not get into a rage and menace in a
furious manner a rupture of the Federal bands.
It is an old maxim that, " wisdom is more valua-
ble than rubies; "and so I think it will not require
much observation and experience, under this
change of Administration, to convince the wildest
opponent of the present hour that it works well;
that the effects arc beneficent and that the peace
and greatness and glory of our whole country arc
promoted thereby.
But I am not done with these tabular statements
and comparisons. The following table is com-
piled from the last published annual report of the
Secretary of the Treasury, and shows the amount
of revenue from the customs in 1857, and the ex-
penses of collecting it for the fiscal year ending

Now, sir, you sec by this that the State that I
have the honor in part to represent, contributes
more to the support of the General Government
than all the other States put together; and we get
from the Federal Treasury scarcely a dollar to
improve our channels of commerce, our rivers
and harbors, while millions are lavished in con-
structing public buildings, harbors, and fortifica-
tions in southern States, which contribute to the
general supnoit not a tithe in the comparison.
More than this. There, only one fortieth part of
the revenue is expended in collecting it, and in
Maryland one tenth is consumed; in Virginia,
North Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi, one
fourth; in Florida, more than half; while in Del-
aware, it seems that the custom-houses do a losing
business, costing seven times as much as they
yield.
This is not all. Under your administration of
the Government, the firstyear of Mr. Buchanan's
term, the expenditures amounted to the sum of
$81,585,667 76—more than the expenditures for
the whole of the first twenty years of our national
existence. For the first forty years, from 1789
to 1830, inclusive, including the war of 1812, our
expenses were $293,541,195 92, and for five years
of Mr. Pierce's and Mr. Buchanan's reign, it !
amounted to §316,949,226 65; so they spent, of
the people's money, $33,408,030 73 more, during
five years, than for the first half of the entire
period of our national being.
During Jackson's term, the revenue did not
exceed $26,000,000 annually, and yet he was able
to conduct the Government from this and extin-
guish $50,000,000 of the public debt; but our pres-
ent Chief Magistrate, with a revenue of over fifty
million dollars annually, is not only unable to bal-
ance the. accounts and extinguish the public debt,
but during the first year increases it §40,000,000
under his financial mismanagement, extravagance,
and corruption. The expenses of the Army have
nearly trebled and the expense of collecting the
revenue has increased over forty per cent., or-
§1,700,000.
In 1840, the " miscellaneous" items were se-
verely criticized, and contributed, in a large de-
gree, to defeat Mr. Van Buren in his canvass for
reelection. It then rose to $2,500,000, and it now
reaches the vast sum of $18,000,003. Gentlemen
will recollect the charges tten preferred against
Mr. Van BurenPbccause of his prodigality in fur-
nishing aud conducting the White House, and yet
all was within the outlay, over salary, of §4,000
a year—while Mr. Buchanan, with his more ex-
pensive luxuries, elegajacey and profligate habits,
squanders $35,000 a year, exclusive of his salary..
Now, whenifrisconsidered that this money comes
mainly from taxes, direct and indirect, on the in-
dustry of the country, three fourth# of which is
found in the North—a burden upon our capital,
our skill, our arts, our professions,and our tabor
—it should not create wonder or surprise.th&t we
seek to return to frugal and economical expend-
iture; and to thi^end will exert all fair means at
the ballot-box, and in every constitutional way, t<*
obtain supremacy in the affairs of the Government.
I will pursue these statements and comparison?
no further. Sufficient has been skown for my
purpose, and sufficient, I trust, to convince all
fair-minded men that, from the " highways and
by-ways of the .so-called Democratic party there
comcsup an insufferable stench/'pervadingevery
tissue of their Administration.
But, sir, bad as these practices are in the ad-
ministration of the Government, demoralizing as
are the means employed to accomplish these pur-
poses, and proscripUve and intolerant as are the
usages of this party in the distribution of favors-
and patronage, it is of minor importance com-
pared with the obstinate and continued effort to
destroy the principles of justice and freedom which
are the substratum of the whole superstructure of
our free institutions. It is said by Tacitus, I be-
lieve, that the first advances of tyrannyare steep
and perilous; but when once you are entered, par-
ties and instruments are ever ready to espouse you.
How true is this of that bold step of the slave
power which first attracted the attention of our
confiding people! I allude to the overthrow of
that time-honored ordinance of freedom, in 1854,
from wlflch act every patriot-heart in the North
shrank with horror, and the whole nation was
then aroused to a sense of danger. Moses was,
not more surprised and appalled', when he came
down from the mountains and found his hosts in
tumult, than were the freedom-loving people of
this Confederacy wh.cn violent hands were laid on
this security to free labor; and none were found, in
all the North, so reckless as to applaud the cruel
purpose. Since then—ah! most painful truth—
since then, from among the universal sentiment
of condemnation, men have been found who ap-
prove of the work,-and go forth with this party
to new sccncs and fresh fields of innovation and
invasion. The Republican party intend to arrest
their progress, and tliey can only do so effectually
by talcing the Government into their own hands.
They will trench upon not the least constitutional
right; tlicy intend no overt act, nor will they coun-
tenance any, affecting the safety or security of
southern men's human chattels; they contemplate
no illegal conspiracy, nor secret treason, but will
march with firm ana honest tread to the very verge
of their constitutional rights, and there stop.
The most conclusive proof that there are no con- ,
siderable number of men in the North with such
wrong intent, is to be found in the late feeble
attempt of John Brown " to promote the good
of freedom by the evil of servile strife and civil
war;" who, after two years of effort, with all his
power to inspire men with his <^vvn views, with
his perseverance and heroism of character; with
his truth, sincerity, and honesty, heightened and
impelled by the cruelties and wrongs heaped upon
him and his family in Kansas, you find him sur-
rounded by only sixteen white men and five ne-
groes in his attempt, "to undo the heavy burdens
and to let the oppressed go free." And it is not
likely that the folly and madness of even this
experiment will be' repeated during the present
century, if ever. It is not from the North slave-
holders have cause of alarm in methods of con-
spiracy, and blood. Jefferson foresaw the source
of greatest peril, when he said:
"The whole eommeice between master and slave is a
perpetual exercise of tlie mobfuolsterous passion, the most
unremitting despotism on one part, and degrading submis-
sion on the otbei."' * * * " Indeed, I tremble tor
niv country when I remember tbat God is just." *
"The Almighty has no attribute which can take si&cs with
u-. in a contest."
That is, a* contest between the enslaveowd the
enslaved
