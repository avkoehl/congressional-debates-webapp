HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,

New Orleans, December 24, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

At 12 p. m. of last night I received telegram,* copy of which I handled you, from Brigadier-General Benton, at Baton Rouge, exhibiting great apprehension of immediate attack. I immediately telegraph to General Ullmann, at Morganza, to send two regiments of infantry without delay. I desire to call the attention of the commanding general to the fact that I am now informed that the same information in substance was communicated by a subaltern of General Benton's staff to Major Marston at 3.45 yesterday afternoon, and if true, and as important as it appears, should have been known to General Benton at that time, Not infrequently movements have failed from this want of promptness, and as it is difficult occasionally to arouse operators in their offices at distant posts at night, this delay from the afternoon into the middle of the night may be the cause of disaster. I shall require General Benton to answer for this apparent neglect of duty.

Your obedient servant,

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, December 24, 1864.

Respectfully returned to Major-General Hurlbut, with the information that the dispatch referred to as having been sent to Major Marston at 3.45 yesterday afternoon was submitted to General Benton in duplicate before it was telegraph to this city.

By order of Major General E. R. S. Canby:

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
