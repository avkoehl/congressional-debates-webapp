THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
1819
on Indian Affairs on this subject I had no
desire, and have none now, to impose on the
Judiciary Committee any labor which would
be unwelcome to them; and much as I desire
the judgment and the advice of that committee
011 the abstract legal propositions embraced in
the bill I should hesitate to enforce them on
the consideration of the Judiciary Committee
against their protest. For that reason I shall
ask the pardon of the chairman for declining
to support the proposition, but will say to him
that 1 prefer, with such advice as we can get
privately from the legal gentlemen of the Sen-
ate, those on the Judiciary Committee espe-
cially, and on consultation with my colleague,
to incorporate a proposition something of a
nature like that which he suggests, and see if
we cannot adjust the matter in that way so as
to be satisfactonr to all parties.

The VICE PRESIDENT. This is an amend-
ment to the rules. The Senator asks for its
present consideration.

The VICE PRESIDENT. Objection being
made it will lie over.

also the amount of such public lands in that State
disposed of during the year 1869, and the price re-

amendment of the rules.
Mr. POMEROY. I move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of the report of
the Committee on the Revision of the Rules.
The motion was agreed to ; and the Senate
proceeded to consider the following resolutions,
reported on the 8th instant by Mr. Anthony,
from the select Committee on the Revision of
the Rules:
Betolved, That the following be adopted as a rule
of the Senate:
Immediately after the privileged morning business
is completed, and not later than one o'olock.theCal-
endar of special orders, if any. fbr that day, includ-
ing the unfinished business of the day previous, shall
betaken up and disposed of; and after that, or if
there shall be no special orders for that time, the
Calendar of peneral orders shall be taken np and pro-
ceeded within its order, beginning with the first sub-
ject on the Calendar; and in such oase the following
motions shall be in order at any time as privileged
motions, save as against a motion to adjourn or to
proceed to the consideration of executive- business,
to wit:
1. A motion to Bass over the pending subject,
which, if carried, snail have the effect to leave such
subject in its existing place on the Calendar for
action at the next oall of the Calendar.
2. A motion to place such subject at the foot of the
Calendar.
Both of these motions shall bedecided without de-
bate, and shall have precedence in the order above
named, and may be submitted as in the nature and
with all the rights of questions of order.
Retolved further. That the twenty-fourth rulo be
amended by adding thereto the following words:
" After the introduction of resolutions is completed
there shall be laid before the Senate, in their order,
resolutions and concurrent resolutions introduced
on any prior day, and the same shall be proceeded
with in the same manner as is provided in the rule
for the Calendar of general orders."
Retolvtd farther. That all rules or orders setting
apart particular days for particular classes of busi-
ness be, and they are hereby, abolished.
Mr. POMEROY. With the concurrence of
the committee I suggest a slight amendment,
to come in after the word "with" in the last
line but one of the first resolution, to insert
"but not later than one o'clock;" so as to
read, "shall be proceeded with, but not later,
than one o'clock." ,
Mr. EDMUNDS.. That is the effect of it
now, but that makes.it clearer.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection that amendment will be made.
Mr. POMEROY. A slight amendment is
necessary in the last resolution. After the
word 4' orders '' the words'' heretofore made''
should be inserted; so that it shall not apply
to what we may order hereafter, but that all
rules and orders heretofore made setting apart
particular days for particular business are abol-
ished.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection this amendment will be regarded as
agreed to. Would not the word " rescinded "
be better than "abolished," the Chair sug-
gests?
Mr.POMEROY. Iproposethatamendment,
by striking out the word " abolished " and in-
serting "rescinded."
The VICE PRESIDENT. That amend-
ment will be made. The question ison agree-
ing to the resolutions as amended.
The resolutions, as amended, were adopted.
. Mr.POMEROY. It is understood that these
rules do not take effect until to-morrow.
Mr. EDMUNDS. They cannot now, because
we have got past the point where they would
begin to operate.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection the now rules will be regarded as not
taking effect until to-morrow.
