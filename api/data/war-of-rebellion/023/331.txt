General THOMAS:

It is reported that Lieutenant-Colonel Lister's command, Thirty-first Ohio, when passing near Mooresville, took 2 mules from Mr. Tucker, a very old and inoffensive man, and gave no pay or receipt and has not returned the property.

The general desires you to have the matter investigated and set right and to report the facts here.

Major-General BUELL, Huntsville:

General Wood has not had time to repair his wagons. They only arrived here last Friday from Reynolds' Station very much broken and out of repair, and need bows, covers, and a great deal of blacksmith work. He will be ready to start to-morrow morning. Colonel Wagner started this morning at 4 o'clock. He telegraphs me that he leaves four companies of the Ninth Michigan and four companies of the Fourth Kentucky Cavalry at Tullahoma.
