THE SECTION WAS IN ACTION AT EIGHT DIFFERENT TIMES DURING THE DAY, AND THE ACCURACY OF THE FIRE SECURED THE COMMENDATION OF THE GENERALS COMMANDING BOTH BRIGADES AND DIVISIONS OF CAVALRY, WHILE THE CONDUCT OF THE MEN WAS IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE CREDITABLE TO THEIR VALOR AND SKILL AS SOLDIERS AND ARTILLERISTS.

I AM, CAPTAIN, VERY RESPECTFULLY, YOUR OBEDIENT SERVANT,

J. WADE WILSON,

SECOND LIEUTENANT, COMDG. SECTION, SIXTH IND. N. Y. BATTERY.

Captain J. W. MARTIN,

COMDG. SIXTH INDEPENDENT NEW YORK BATTERY.

Numbers 372. REPORT OF Captain JOHN C. TIDBALL, SECOND U. S. ARTILLERY, COMMANDING SECOND BRIGADE, HORSE ARTILLERY.

CAMP NEAR WARRENTON, VA.,

AUGUST 4, 1863.

SIR: I HAVE THE HONOR TO SUBMIT HEREWITH THE REPORTS OF LIEUTENANT CALEF, COMMANDING HORSE BATTERY A, SECOND U. S. ARTILLERY, AND

LIEUTENANT FULLER, COMMANDING HORSE BATTERY C, THIRD U. S. ARTILLERY, DETAILING IN AS CONCISE FORM AS POSSIBLE THE OPERATIONS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BATTERIES IN THE RECENT MOVEMENTS OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, WHICH RESULTED SO SUCCESSFULLY IN THE EXPULSION OF THE CONFEDERATE ARMY FROM PENNSYLVANIA AND MARYLAND. IN SUBMITTING THESE REPORTS, IT IS UNNECESSARY FOR ME TO ADD ANYTHING TO SHOW THE IMPORTANT PART ACTED BY THESE BATTERIES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CAVALRY WITH WHICH THEY WERE SERVING IN THESE OPERATIONS. NEVER IN THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC HAS SUCH ARDUOUS SERVICE BEEN REQUIRED OF BATTERIES, AND IN EVERY INSTANCE IN MARCHING AND INFIGHTING THEY PROVED THEMSELVES EQUAL TO ALL REQUIREMENTS, AND RECEIVED THE WELL-EARNED COMMENDATION OF THOSE WITH WHOM THEY SERVED. AS THE OPERATIONS OF THE CAVALRY ARE MOSTLY ON THE EXTERIOR OF THE ARMY AND OUT OF VIEW OF THE GREATER PART OF IT, BUT AN IMPERFECT KNOWLEDGE EXISTS OF THE IMPORTANCE AND ARDUOUSNESS OF ITS SERVICE. SO ALSO OF THE BATTERIES OF HORSE ARTILLERY SERVING WITH THE CAVALRY; BATTERIES AND SECTIONS, CONSTANTLY DETACHED AND FREQUENTLY ENGAGED WITH THE ENEMY, WITH THAT UNCERTAINTY OF POSITION, FORCE, AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ALWAYS ATTEND RECONNAISSANCES AND SKIRMISHING, NECESSARILY CALL TO THE FULLEST EXTENT FOR THE INTELLIGENCE AND ALL OTHER RESOURCES OF THE OFFICERS COMMANDING, AND IT IS WITH PRIDE AND SATISFACTION THAT I REQUEST THE SPECIAL ATTENTION OF THE MAJOR-GENERAL COMMANDING TO THE RECENT SERVICES OF SECOND LIEUTENANTS CALEF AND RODER, OF HORSE BATTERY A, SECOND U. S. ARTILLERY, AND OF FIRST LIEUTENANTS FULLER, MEINELL, AND KELLY, AND SECOND LIEUTENANT LANCASTER, OF HORSE BATTERY C, THIRD U. S. ARTILLERY. HORSE BATTERY K, FIRST U. S. ARTILLERY (GRAHAM'S), AND E, FIRST U. S. ARTILLERY (RANDOL'S), THE OTHER TWO OF THE SECOND BRIGADE, HORSE ARTILLERY, ARE STILL DETACHED WITH THE FIRST AND SECOND CAVALRY DIVISIONS, AND THE REPORTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS WILL DOUBTLESS BE MADE THROUGH THE COMMANDING OFFICERS OF THOSE DIVISIONS.

VERY RESPECTFULLY, YOUR OBEDIENT SERVANT,

J. C. TIDBALL,

Captain 2nd U. S. ARTILLERY, COMDG. 2nd BRIG., HORSE ARTILLERY.

Lieutenant Colonel A. J. ALEXANDER,

ASST. ADJT. GENERAL, CAVALRY CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.
