HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA,April 20, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjt. and Insp. General C. S. Army, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to forward report of General Corse concerning the destruction of the Cape Lookout light-house. The men engaged in it are certainly entitled to great praise, if not reward.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. E. PICKETT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Kinston, N. C, April 12, 1864.

MAJOR: I have the honor to hand the report of the destruction of the light-houses at Cape Lookout. One, the lower, about 90 feet high, was destroyed. The other was badly damaged. That was 160 feet high, with walls 10 feet thick, and owing to the inferior quality of the powder was not entirely destroyed. The walls, however, are much injured - cracked and bulged out. All the oil, &amp;c., was destroyed, and the steps for 10 feet. The affair reflects credit upon the parties who participated in it. The inconvenience to the enemy from the temporary loss of so important a landmark on that dangerous coast must be seriously felt.

Very respectfully,

M. D. CORSE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major C. PICKETT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
