RICHMOND, August 9, 1864.

General D. H. MAURY,

Mobile, Ala.:

Some days since Brigadier General St. John R. Liddell was ordered to report to you for duty at Mobile, and still earlier B. M. Thomas was appointed brigadier-general for reserves of Alabama. This, I hope, will cover your request of yesterday. The surrender of Fort Gaines under the circumstances is deeply humiliating.

JEFFN. DAVIS.
