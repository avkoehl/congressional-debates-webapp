Richmond, Va., January 1, 1863

General R. E. LEE:

I have information that there is in Hampton Roads a large fleet, said to be one hundred transports. General Smith has just returned from North Carolina; apprehends very seriously invasion on a large scale in that State. Either that or a surprise of this city may be meditated. Would it not be judicious to have a considerable detailment of your army either here or within supporting distance?

I have placed Major [W.

Major Garrett has orders to pursue and arrest every man in the mountains, of
