Reams' Station; the force on the road was largely re-enforced last night, and will push on the work. I send to-day a Richmond paper of the 23d, directed to the Secretary of War. You will see from that great despondency was caused by the last affair on the Weldon road. In Richmond they have reports of 5 generals being killed in that action, but the death of but 2 of them (Sanders and Lamar) is positively confirmed.

CITY POINT, VA., August 26, 1864.

I have no report of casualties yet from operations yesterday near Reams' Station. Orders were given during the day for General Hancock to return, but being pressed by the enemy, he could not do so until night. Frequent assaults were repulsed, but just before night the enemy carried one point of the line and captured eight pieces of artillery. The staff officer, who gives the only report I have, thinks the enemy were very severely punished, and that our loss in prisoners will be small. During the night General Hancock returned to his place in line without opposition. Yesterday morning the enemy drove in General Butler's picket-line. The picket guard soon rallied, however, drove the enemy back and re-established their lines. The result was 1 killed, 16 wounded, and 14 missing on our side. Two commissioned officers and 59 men were captured from the enemy. What their casualties were in killed and wounded we do not know.

U. S. GRANT,

DEEP BOTTOM, September 29, 1864-4 p. m.

Kautz's cavalry was in sight of Richmond at last accounts, on the Darbytown road. A division of infantry has been sent to his support. I did not expect to carry Richmond, but was in hopes of causing the enemy so to weaken the garrison of Petersburg as to be able to carry that place. The great object, however, is to prevent the enemy sending re-enforcements to Early.
