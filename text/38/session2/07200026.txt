year, beyond $75,000,000. The available prob-
able resources for the current year may then be
stated as follows:
From customs.   $70,271,091 96
From lands  64*2,185 84
Ffotn internal revenue  249,56*2,859 92
From miscellaneous sources  24,020,171 44
From direct tax  16,079 86
From certificates of indebtedness  75,QUO,000 00
, Aggregate  419,512,389 02
•To this should be added:
Probable unexpended balances June 30,
1865      350,000,000 00
Balance of cash July 1, 1864  18,84-2,5o8 71
Total resources    $788,354,947 73
Which, deducted from expenditures, leaves balance to be
provided by loans  $020,727,508 11
If, however, an additional sum of §50,000,000 should be
realized, as proposed by the Commissioner, from in-
ternal duties, the amount to be raised by loans would
be  $570,'/27,508 U
From this should be deducted the public
debt redeemed  83,353.300 09
Leaving as increase of the public debt at
the close of the yeat*  $482,374,188 02
Stated in the usual form by taking the actual
receipts and expenditures of the first quarter as a
distinct basis of calculation, the result is the same,
namely:
For the firstquarter of the currentyoar, ending
September 30, 1864, the actual receipts, as shown
by the books of the Treasury, were as follows:
From customs  $10,971,091 96
From lands  342,185 84
From direct tax  1(3.079 86
From internal revenue..   46,562,859 92
From miscellaneous sources  9,020,m 44
75,212,3S9 02
Add actual balancc in the Treasuiy July
1,1864  18,842.558 71
Receipts from all sources excepting loans, 91,054,947 73
For the three remaining quarters,
ending on the 30th of June, 1865,
the estimate is:
From customs............£51,000,000 00
From internal revenue....203,000,000 00
From lands..*  300,000 00
From miscellaneous
sources   15,000,000 00
  269,300,000 00
Total receipts from ordinaty sources, act-
ual and estimated, with balance on hand
July 1, 1864  $363,354,947 73
The expenditures for the first quarter, ending-
September 30, 1864, were as follows, namely:
For civil service   $8,712.422 51
For pensions and Indians  4,935J 79 31
For War Department  286.200,288 52
For Navy Department  33,292,916 49
For interest on public debt   19.921,054 48
Total, exclusive of principal of pubhedebt, 353,061,861 31
For the three remaining quarters the
estimated expenditures,bused up-
on appropriations and estimated
deficiencies, are:
For the civil service $26,852,489 47
For pensions and Indians.. 6,516,595 72
For War Department 677,479,384 39
For Navy Department  109.929,6'14 16
Forinterestonpublic debt, 71,889,160, 70
 _8921667.274 44
Total ofexpenditures,actual and estimated, 1,245,729,135 75
These estimates include all unexpended
appropriations from former years, and
there may be deducted, as a probable un-
expended balance at the close ofthe year, 350,000,000 00
Leaving total amount, actual and es-ti-'
mated, lor the current vear  895,729,135 75
Deducting from the total expenditure* the
total of receipts, actual and estimated.. 363,354,947 73
There will remain  5:52,374,188 02
If Congress should adopt measures for in-
creasing the lntei nai icvenue at an eai ly
day, the Secretary believes theie may
be added to the receipts from that source, 50,000,000 00
Which being deducted, there will remain
to be provided  $482,374,188 02
* In addition to the liabilities before stated, it may be
mentioned that the 7.30 notes, so called, the issue of 1861,
and the one-year fjve per cent, legal tenders, amounting to
$13,585 000, also become payable dunng the current year.
The conversion of the former being piovided for, however,
by the act Of Augu>t 5, 1861, and the latter by a power of
substitution under the act of June 30,1864, they have been
excluded troi.i this> estimate. The amount of 7.30 notes
redefined in money to November 1, 1864, is only $63,500,
charged tocurieut expenditure*; while the whole amount
convened to that date is §125,864,900.
The public debt, matured and matming, during the year,
is, as before stated $163,353,320 09
From this may be deducted, as likely to
be piovided bv new certificates of indebt-
edness...        75,000,000 00
• 88,353,320 09
482,374,188 02
Add this sum to balance to be provided for
expenditures of the year 
It makes whole amount to be provided
from loans  570,727,508 11
But as this would include so much ofthe
existing public debt as would be re-
deemed, exceeding certificates issued
within the year, namely   88,353,320 09
This sum is to be deducted from the
amount to be obtained by loans, namely,
$570,727,508 11, showing the probable
increase of the public debt during the
year to be  482,374,188 02
Which added to  1,740,690,489 49
Would make the public debt on July 1,
1865 $2,223,064,677 51
subject to such increase as may be occasioned
should Congress not provide for additional reve-
nue, or should the income from ordinary sources
fall short of the estimates submitted.
Any estimate which may be made of the prob-
able receipts and expenditures for the next fiscal
year must necessarily be liable to still greaterun-
certainty. This remark applies more particularly
to expenditures. For while, if existing laws re-
main unchanged, the amount of revenue may be
calculated with reasonable certainty, it is impos-
sible toanticipate what the exigencies of war may
require. On the one hand this may call for in-
creased effort, and on the other it may be confi-
dently hoped that the great struggle is near its
termination, and that,consequently, the estimate
now submitted will prove far beyond the wants
of the year. While any doubt remains, however,
it would be unsafe to assume any other basis of
calculation than one predicated upon the existing
state of affairs.
The receipts for the year ending June 30,1866,
are estimated as follows:
From customs  $70,000,000 00
From internal duties    300,000,000 00
From lands  1,000,000 00
From miscellaneous sources   25,000,000 00
Aggregate    $396,000,000 00
The expenditures are estimated ds follows:
Balance of unexpended appropriations.. $350,000,000 00
For the civil setvice  33,082,097 2i
For pensions and Indians....  14,196,050 64
For the War Department  531,758,191 11
For the Navy Dep.utment  112,219,666 18
For inteiest on the public debt . 127,000,000 00
Aggregate    1,168,256,005 17
But liom tin-* aggregate there may be de-
ducted, an likely to remain unexpended
at the close of the year  350,000,000 00
Total  818,256,005 17
Deduct estimated receipts from ordinary
sources  396,000,000 00
There will remain to be provided for by
loans  422,256,005 17
To this should be added, for redemption of
c-xcess of ceitiOcutes ol indebtedness, 47,365,000 00
Making the whole amount to be provided
tor by loans  $469,621,005 17
Assuming the correctness of these estimates, the
whole debt on July 1, 1866, would be found by
adding the foregoing amount of $42*2,256,005 17 to
the estimated debt on July I, 1865, $2,223,064,-
677 51, giving $2,6*15,320,682 68 as the amount
of the debt at the close of the next fiscal year.
This calculation is made on the same basis of re-
ceipts as that assumed for the currentyear. It is
quae probable, m the judgment of the Commis-
sioner of internal Revenue, that$300,000,000 may
be received in anotheryear from thatsource, with-
out the additional legislation suggested by him.
Should tins supposition be verified, and the new
taxes proposed for this year be laid and continued,
an additional $50,000,000 might be expected from
internal revenue. The Secretary has, however,
thought it wiser to name $300,000,000 as all that
would probably be realized.
It will be observed that the actual receipts from
ordinary sources, for the last fiscal year, varied
materially from the estimates, particularly from
customs and internal revenue. This variation is
imputable, in great part, to the legislation of Con-
gress at, its last session, increasing largely the rates
of duty on foreign and domestic articles. It is ap-
prehended, however, that similar results will not
follow for the residue of the present year in both
these particulars. The increase of duties on im-
ports, under the act of June 30,1864, has already
had the effect to decrease importations to a con-
siderable extent, and the same effect will be likely
to continue; so that, estimating the receipts of the
three remaining quarters by those of the first, in
the light of former experience, it will not be safe
to calculate upon revenue from customs much ex-
ceeding $70,000,000 for the current year.
In the judgment of the Secretary, this disad-
vantage, in a financial point of view, is more
than counterbalanced by the stimulus afforded
to domestic industry, and the consequent in-
creased revenue from that source.
Fiom internal revenue a different and far more
favorable result may be anticipated. It will be
noticed that, instead of $77,599,703 59, there
was received from this source in the past year
$108,260,320 59, under substantially the same
law which, in ten months of the preceding year,
yielded only $37,640,787 95.
The new law which went into operation on the
1st of July last, largely increasing these duties,
although it will probably fail to produce the -
amount of revenue hoped for, may, if not ma-
terially changed, together with the special income
tax imposed by the joint resolution of July 2,
1864, be safely estimated to produce the sum of
$250,000,000, should the business of the country
be oidinaiily prosperous. The same causes
which, under preceding laws, produced so large
an increase in the second year, would be likely
to have a similar effect, to some extent, under the
new, so that at least the amount of $250,000,000
may be expected from jt in another year without
the aid of a special income tax.
But this amount is not and ought not to be
satisfactory. Three hundred millions, at least,
should be realized from internal duties. It is for
Congress to select the souices and devise the
modes in which this most desirable result can be
attained, and the report of the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue is referred to for his views on
this important point, as well as for many valu-
able suggestions having reference to the same
general subject.
The Secretary will venture, with great defer-
ence, to remark that, in his judgment, a commis-
sion, properly constituted, for the purpose of in-
quiring as to profitable sources of revenue, and
devising improvemenfs in the modes of its col-
lection, might, in a country of such varied pro-
duction, and among a people of such diverse in-
dustrial pursuits, chcit much information which
would materially assist the deliberations of Con-
gress, and lighten its labors, upon a subject so
new to legislative experience on this continent.
As, however, a resolution pointing to this end
did not meet the approval of Congress at its last
session, the Secretary did not feel authorized to
instituteaninquiry through such instrumentality,
and he has been unable to adopt other effective
measures for the same purpose.
After much reflection, and a careful revision of
his opinions heretofore expressed in another place,
to which, under the circumstances, he may be par-
doned for referring, the Secretary feels obliged to
say that he sees no other resource for raising the
additional revenue, so necessary to the national
credit, than those pointed out by the Commis-
sioner. He is aware of the great difficulties attend-
ing the collection of the duties proposed, and feels
all the objections heretofore made to their imposi-
tion. Henevertheless believesthat a tax on tobacco"
in the leaf, o run manufactured, if it can be enforced,
is the only mode by. which the duty on that article
can be collected fairly and equally, and through
which an adequate amount of revenue can be ob-
tained from it. He believes,also, that,although
a tax on sales would probably fail of collection to
some extent, yet, by applying to it stringent rules,
requiring frequent periodical returns, verified by •
oath, coupled with the power to compel an exhibit
of books of account, it might become a very large
and important item of revenue. The Secretary
would further suggest whether the income tax
should not be collected upon all, without exemp- t
