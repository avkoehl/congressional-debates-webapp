Off Alexandria, La., March 30, 1864.

Brigadier General CHARLES P. STONE, Chief of Staff, &amp;c., Alexandria:

GENERAL: I have received your communication about the rebels blockading Loggy Bayou. I think the object is to keep the gunboats from getting up Lake Bistineau it Minden, where they have a large supply of stores and cotton. if there is a rise the gun-boats will pass the obstructions; if not, there will be lost of trouble. I don's seem to be able to start the Ozark off the rocks. if I could have the use of the Alice Vernon for a short time,s he is a powerful boat, and would likely move her.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DAVID D. PORTER,
