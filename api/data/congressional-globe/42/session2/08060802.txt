The Journal of yesterday was read and

iron-workers' memorials.
Mr. KILLINGER. Mr. Speaker, I have
sought the floor at this time in order that I
might bring to the notice of the House and
the country a subject of great importance
to my constituents. That subject is indicated
and forcibly stated in the numerous me-
morials which I have presented during the
last week. The memorialists state they are,
for the most part, iron-workers, which desig-
nation includes mechanics, skilled laborers,
and others engaged in the manufacture of
iron, iron machinery, and the various branches
of industry of which that metal forms a com-
ponent part. They respectfully remonstrate
against any change in the existing revenue
laws which shall reduce or abolish the duties
upon such articles as are successfully produced
in this country.
In thus presenting the subject to the consid-
eration of Congress, the workingmen of my dis-
trict have exercised a right common to every
American citizen, and are entitled to respect-
ful consideration. These men represent a
class of persons who in a large degree are the
producers of our national wealth, and are the
kind of men upon whom rests finally a great
share of the burdens of national taxation.
Their hands are brown with honest toil, their
brows are moist with the sweat of honest labor,
and I desire to suggest that they are as much
entitled to a hearing here and in the committee-
rooms of Congress as the hired emissaries of
