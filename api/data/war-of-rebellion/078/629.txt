[THIRD indorsement.]

JUNE 1, 1864.

QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL:

I have sent up so many similar applications and indorsements that it is useless to press them further on the Secretary of the Treasury. I have likewise personally urged the embarrassments of the debts and the necessity of funds. He promises they shall be supplied as rapidly as the resources of the Treasury and its ability to issue notes will allow.

J. A. S.,

Secretary.

General S. COOPER,

By direction of General R. E. Lee, I am here on my way with my available force to co-operate with General Imboden in Valley. Colonel G. B.
