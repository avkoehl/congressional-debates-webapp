doubt he may do so; but in many instances
the paymaster is in the field at a distant point;''
and there is another set of objections which
occur to me. Each one of these paymasters
is to be a walking savings bank. Where does
he keep his funds? I think the Senator told
me some time ago in a strong box, or what-
ever it may be. It would occur to me that
such an arrangement as this will be likely
to multiply instances of which we have heard
so much, and that the case is sufficiently pro-
vided for by the opportunity of the soldier to
go to any officer or to any person whom he
selects himself, somebody whom he may prefer
to the paymaster, and make loan or deposit
of his money.
However, I am not going to vote against
this bill if the Senator from Massachusetts
presses it. He understands vastly more
about it than I do ; and I venture only these
suggestions because this seems to me to be an
experiment which, unless it has been thought
of, is pretty hazardous in ils character.
Mr. CORBETT. The former law allowed
the soldiers to deposit with the paymaster
any sum of money which they desired, and the
money was received by the paymaster and was
placed on his books and reported to the Treas-
ury as so much money deposited, and was paid
out to the soldiers like all other money. This
law a few years ago, by some means, was re-
pealed, and the soldiers were compelled to take
back their money. It caused demoralization,
caused thega to desert; and this bill lias been
prepared, as I understand, with a view of simply
restoring that law, and giving to the soldiers
four per cent, on the amount they may leave
with the Government. As the Government
has to pay others interest to the amount of
four per cent, at least, it would seem to be just
to allow the soldiers at least that rate on the
funds they may accumulate with the Govern-
ment until they are discharged. The money
is not to be paid to them until they are dis-
charged. This bill does not prevent them
from selecting any other persons and deposit-
ing their money with them, but simply gives
paymasters an opportunity to receive this
money and pay it out like other money. There
is no trouble in this bill. It has been prepared,
I understand, with a great deal of care.
Mr. SAULSBURY. Mr. President 
Mr. PRATT. Is it in order to make a
report?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. This bill is
before the Senate by unanimous consent. It
can be displaced by a call for the regular order.
Mr. PRATT. 1 call for the regular order.
Mr. SAULSBURY. I asked the Senator
from Massachusetts some time ago whether the
paymasters would be responsible on their bonds
for this money deposited with them, and 1 re-
ceived no answer but that these bonds were
properly prepared by the Military Department.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will say to my friend that
I have looked at, the law on that point
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is
being proceeded with by unanimous consent,
and the Senator from Indiana objects to its fur-
ther consideration. Reports of committees are
now in order.
