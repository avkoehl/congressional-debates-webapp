Brigadier-General STURGIS,

Commanding Second Div., Ninth Army Corps, Winchester, Ky.:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs that you concentrate your whole division at a point on the Richmond and Crab Orchard road, where it crosses Paint Lick. The destination of the Ninth Corps has been changed.

You will choose the route by which the Second Brigade will march to the point indicated. The cavalry should reach its destination before the Second Brigade is entirely withdrawn from Winchester and its vicinity.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

NICOLAS BOWEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Van Dorn is probably not at Eastport. Forrest, with 3,000 or 4,000 men, is all that is there. Dodge had better stay at Iuka. Should Van Dorn turn out to be there, we will follow up his rear at once.

Yours, respectfully,

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

We crossed Stone's River at Charlton's Ford, 4 miles northeast of this camp, moved in the direction of Lebanon, 8 miles from the ford, to Hugle's Mill, where we loaded 65 wagons with corn, and then moved on, in the same direction, to Logue's tannery, 2 miles from Hugle's, where we loaded, as at Hugle's, from the farms of active rebels, 25 wagons with corn. While the teams were being loaded at Logue's, a squad of rebel cavalry made a dash on the vedettes I had thrown out on the Lebanon road, but were driven off without doing any damage to my men.

From Logue's, I marched in a southwesterly direction, to Goodwin's
