appendix e.
The following paragraphs from the work of
Sir John Barnard Byles have been selected
as deserving consideration from thoughtful
Americana *
"There are some few conn tries in the world which
enjoy peculiar facilities for the production of par-
ticular commodities; sueh as the south of France
for wine, Cuba for sugar, some districts of England
for coals and iron; but the immeasurably greater
portion of the surface of the habitable globe consists
of countries moderately, and but moderately,
adapted for the production even of the necessaries
and comforts of life, of food, clothing,uud lodging.
These countries can m every single article they pro-
duce be surpassed and undersold by some country or
other.
"Put the case of such a country with moderate
facilities for the production of most things, with ex-
traordinary facilities for tke production of nothing.
It can grow wheat, but not so cheap as Poland;
it can grow wine, but not so cheap as France or
Spam; it can manufacture, but not so cheap as Eng-
land.
" First, imagine that country under a system of
protection so strict as to be jealous, and, if you
please, injudicious. The nation cultivates the land
and works up the produce. It creates wealth at
"both ends of the exchange. Its manufactures ex-
change with its agricultural products. Native
industry can and does supply it with the necessaries
and comforts of life. A numerous population may
be employed, fed, clothed, and lodged. Industry
and plenty reign. All this may be and is done
under great natural disadvantages both of soil and
chrnate. Human art and industry triumph, never-
theless, over every obstacle, aud can raise, as in the
case of Holland, a great and powerful State in a
morals. Foreign trade Will in the end be introduced?
supplying luxuries and Carrying away superfluities.
"^ovr, imagine that country under a system of
universal free trade and unrestricted imports. Ex-
cept in a'few favored spots, it cannot grow wheat;
for Poland will be ab.e to undersell it, not only in
foreign-markets, but in its own. It cannot manu-
facture; tor in cottons, hardware, woolens, and
other products of manufacturing industry England
can undersell it abroad and at home. It cannot
grow wine; for France or Spain can everywhere
undersell it. Neither can it continue to import its
corn, its manufactures, or its wine from abroad; for
its ownimlustry being superseded and smothered,
it has nothing to gfve in exchange. It becomes,
then, in this condition: it can neither grow nor
make tor itself, nor yet buy from abroad. It goes
without; or, it not entirely without, it is scantily
and wietchedly supplied. A starving and ragged
population derive a wretched and precarious sub-
sistence from half-cultivated land. It has neither
domestic industry nor foreign trade.
"Such is tiie natural capability of a very largepro-
poriion of the countries in the world. They enjoy
moderate facilities for the production of everything
lioee^try for the sustenance of a. population; ex-
traordii)dry facilities for the production ot little or
nothing; With a generally diffused system of judi- 
cious aud discriminating protection, concentrating
the industry of each country on its own soil and
indigenous materials, industry flourishes, wealth
increases, commerce toliows. population multiplies
throughout the globe* But without such artiiieial
regulations, population, industry, and wealth have
a tendency to concentrate and confine themselves
to certain favored spots; there, indeed, they may
flourish, but over the vast area of the world at large
they have a tendency to dwindle and decay; but
Eroteerlon wisely regulated, instead of being, as has
een represented, a blight on universal industry, is
a system of universal irrigation diffusing industry
where indusTry would otherwise never have flowed,
►and making even the desert rejoice.
"One of these temporary and accidental disad-
vantages against which public wisdom has to guard,
is the necessary and invariable inferiority of infant
•manufacturing iudustry. No matter thattbeinfant
isciipub'ft of soon becoming not only a man, but a
gunr, ii* not protected during infancy he will lan-
guid mid die.
"Established manufactures enjoy the factitious
advantages of great capital, skill, and experience.
Production on a large scale, in immense quantities,
creates a cheapness which unprotected intaut estab-
lishments elsewhere, though their natural advan-
tages may be much greater, c&nrtot rival. They are
smothered as .->ooa as they are born. Accordingly
all m mufdctures, however" great, have been and
ever must be cradlea in protection. So far from
protection producing monopoly it is protection alone
that can prevent the first established manufactures
from enjoying an unjust and undeserved monopoly.
It is protection alonethat can establish a wholesome
rivalry, or even secure the certain development
of matiuiactures, whei e there are greatest natural
advantages; nav, this-is a case where protection is
essential to ultimate cheapness as well as plenty.
Mr. Burke's maxim is here no paradox—'Make
thins?* dear,' says he, 4 that they may be cheap.'
" Moreover, the true gain of every country is ample
wages to the laborer. The laboring classes are the
nai ion They are the producers, and they are, more-
over, the greatest consumers. Their expenditure
makes the great home market.
" But in thefierce struggle of universal competition,
extending oyer the Wihuie e^rth,. the remuneration
of the laborer must be everywhere beaten down to
the. lexel of tho worst paid laborers in the world,
whether freemen or slaves.
" All great manufactures had their origin in the
protective system. Take our own, the greatest, and
until lately, least sickly of any. All our own manu-
factures took their rise in a system of protective du-
ties so high as to amount to prohibitions. Inaddition
to this, owing totbe fearful hostilities that raged in
Europe for nearly a quarter of a century before 1815,
we enjoyed a further accidental monopoly of the
manufacturing industry of the world. And this
stringent protection has not only created manufac-
tures, but created them where they would not natu-
rally have existed in spite of great natural disad-
vantages. Other nations have coal and iron ore as
well as we. The United States are even richer in
this respect. But other nations have alsowhatwe
have not—they have native raw materials. It has
been justly observed that Great Britain is singularly
poor m the raw materials which constitute the basis
ot the greater portion of her manufacturing industry.
"We have no cotton, no silk, no fine wool. Even our
best iron for the manufacture of hardware comes
from Sweden; our oils, gums, colors, woods, from the
ends of the earth.
" Next to us in manufacturing industry is France.
Her manufacturing industry, though still inferior
to ours, has nevertheless since the peace augmented
in an even greaterratio, but under strict and jealous
protection.
"After France comes Germany. Let any one,
before the late struggle, have visited tha-coun-iries
embraced by the Zollvercin. To say that protection
has there produced manufacturing prosperity would
| be to beg the question. But one thing is certain,
that exactly coincident in time and place with the
most stringent protective laws has arisen a manu-
facturing industry and production of wealth wit hout
an approach to a parallel in ail the former history
of Germany.
"Take now a small State, Belgium. In propor-
tion to her area, her manufacturing industry is per-
haps greater than that of any other country, not
excepting tho United Kingdom itself. Bat in Bel-
gium, not only has tho protective system long flour-
ished, but the protecting duties are now higher than
ever. Belgium is the very paradise of protection.
Nay. there is even a bounty on exportation.
"Cross the Atlantic, and look at the past and
present policy of the United States. For some years
after the last war low import duties were tried. The
effects were ruinous; they were abandoned lor duties
avowedly protective. Our economists prognosticated
mischief, but the result was prosperity and a vast
extension of cotton, woolen, and iron manufactures.
Branches of industry, which in the presence of free
imports from England would never have had even
a beginning, now threaten rivalry."—Sophisms of
Free Trade, Philadelphia, 1872.
