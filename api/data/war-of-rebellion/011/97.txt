Under the instructions which I have previously received and a dispatch also of to-day from Major-General Halleck, it will not then do to advance beyond Pea Ridge, or some point which we can reach and return in a day. General Halleck will probably be here himself to-morrow. Instructions have been sent to the different division commanders not included in your command to be ready in the morning either to find if an enemy was in front or to advance.

Major General JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Commanding First Division:

I have instructed Taylor's cavalry to push out the road toward Corinth, to ascertain if the enemy have retreated; and, if so, to return the information to you and General Sherman. Should they be retreating, I want all the cavalry belonging to the entire command to follow them, supported by three or four brigades of infantry. It will not, after the rain of last night, be practicable to move artillery. You will furnish one of the brigades.
