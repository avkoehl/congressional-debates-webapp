VENRON, July 12, 1863.

General WILLCOX,

Indianapolis:

I would suggest the sending of four or five companies to guard the bridges at Vernon and these towns. The citizens are very uneasy, and the country is full of straggling rebels.

INDIANAPOLIS, July 12, 1863.

General WALLACE,

Vernon:

I think you had better either let Burkham go to Lawrenceburg and take boats now waiting there for operations on the river, or else plant him at North Vernon and Vernon to defend the road that way should Morgan turn back. Telegraph which you will do.

Brigadier-General.

VERNON, July 12, 1863-4.15 p. m.

General WILLCOX,

Indianapolis:

The following has just been sent me from Dupont:

DUPONT-2 p. m.

Colonel Hobson with all his force is after Morgan, and almost on his rear.

VERNON, July 12, 1863-4.30 p. m.

Brigadier-General WILLCOX,

Indianapolis:

At 11 a. m. I sent you the following dispatch:

A scout down the Madison and Indianapolis Railroad just back. They report two bridges burned; that Morgan passed through Dupont between 7 and 8 this morning; that the bridges burned were over Middle Fork and Big Creek.

A courier from Hobson's command confirms the truth of the above, hence can make no connection with Madison by rail. Have just sent forward all our mounted men upon Morgan's rear, 160 in number, under Colonel Shuler. I am putting command aboard of cars for Dupont.

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General.
