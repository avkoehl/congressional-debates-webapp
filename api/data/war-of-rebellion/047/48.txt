Respectfully,

JOHNSON HAGOOD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

MORRIS ISLAND, August 19, 1863.

Admiral DAHLGREN:

I am now pushing my approaches to Fort Wagner, and need cover against sorties. I think I can destroy the traverse and dismount the heavy gun on the sea front of Wagner with the assistance of a powerful fire from the New Ironsides. If that big gun were out of the way, could a couple of monitors be within 400 or 500 yards of Wagner all the time, night and day? A deserter says there are at least twenty quaker guns on the parapet of Sumter.

GILLMORE,

General.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, August 19, 1863-3.45 p.m.

General GILLMORE:

I am going in with the monitors to feel of Sumter; if the enemy's fire is heavy, please get your batteries in action.

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.

MORRIS ISLAND, August 19, 1863.

Admiral DAHLGREN:

All right; it shall be done.

GILLMORE,

General.
