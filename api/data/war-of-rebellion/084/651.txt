here some few days since that you were to be placed in command of this army, vice General Washburn. If so, general, don't leave one fellow named Smith behind. This last entre nous. There was a fight yesterday below here. The wounded are being brought in. Have no particulars yet. The 100-days' men are reported by every officer I have spoken with as good for nothing, except provost-guard and orderlies.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ARDEN R. SMITH,

Captain and Commissary of Subsistence.

LITTLE ROCK, August 11, 1864.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS,

Devall's Bluff, Ark.:

The ammunition asked for by General West is on the train. How many men can the Celeste carry? How long will it take her to make the trip? Is there any bridge material ready to go on her? Do you think it safe to send her?

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

DEVALL'S BLUFF, August 11, 1864-11.15 a.m.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Little Rock:

Dispatch of 9.30 only this moment received. Celeste can carry 250 men. It will take twelve hours to get to Augusta. We have tools but not bridge materials. It is not absolutely safe, but I think it prudent to send the Celeste up.

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Delayed on account of storm.

OPERATOR.

[Indorsement.]

I think it best to send the Celeste to take dispatches, ammunition, &amp;c.
