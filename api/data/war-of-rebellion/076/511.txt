SCHOFIELD'S HEADQUARTERS,

August 15, 1864- 12.30 p. m.

Major- General SHERMAN:

Colonel Garrard moved down early this morning to join Kilpatrick, but I have heard nothing from the m. I will send an officer oat once to watch the road along the enemy's left ad report.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major- General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,August 15, 1864- 1 p. m.

Major- General SHERMAN:

I have just returned from extreme right. The enemy seems to have completed his works as far as the point where you saw them working the other day. Beyond that nothing can be seen. The enemy shows no force in or about this works on his left. I have laid out my lines preparatory to the proposed movement, and will have them constructed to- night. I have not yet been able to learn enough of the roads to be clear as to the details of the movement.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major- General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Near Atlanta, Ga., August 15, 1864.

Major- General SHERMAN:

I am preparing to carry on the next move about twelve days' supplies, which I can make last twenty days if necessary. Shall we leave all baggage wagons in rear! Will there be time to send wagons to the rear after your orders are issued, or shall it be done at once!

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major- General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 15, 1864.

(Received 9 p. m.)

General SCHOFIELD:

There will be plenty of time to dispose of wagons after my orders are issued. I want to hear of General Kilpatrick and Garrard before making my orders, but I am more and more satisfied the movement we contemplate is the true one to be made. I think Generals Steedman and John E. Smith will drive Wheeler far away and repair out road in two days. Give me the earliest news of the cavalry on your flank.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Near Atlanta, Ga., August 15, 1864.

Major- General SHERMAN:

I do not believe Wheeler can hurt us at all seriously; he cannot do more than break the road in a few places and possibly pick up one or two of my small garrisons and thus relieve Steedman of the dispute
