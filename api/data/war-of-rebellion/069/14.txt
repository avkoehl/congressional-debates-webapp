Major-General MEADE:

The Maryland Brigade behaved most commendably yesterday, and I believe were the only veteran troops engaged seriously. Colonel Dushane was just arriving with the First Maryland veterans, and on hearing the firing went in to action at once without orders from any one. He lost considerably, and had his own horse killed. As there have been some unfavorable remarks made about this brigade which were rather uncalled for, about which they are sensitive, I wish especially to commend their conduct on yesterday as an act of justice and for the good of the service.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
