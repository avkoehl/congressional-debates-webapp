as Valentine's Factory. We reached the Tennessee River, opposite Hamburg, without any opposite, about 10 o'clock at night. During this day's march we also burned immense quantities of corn and fodder.

On the expedition we destroyed seven cotton factories, not one of which cost less than $200,000, and the raw material and finished goods in them were worth infinitely more than the cost of the factories and machinery. On of them contained 300 looms, and employed not less than 2,000 persons. The loss to the Confederacy in this respect alone amounted to several millions of dollars.

On Saturday, while my command was recrossing the Tennessee River, I heard that Captain Carmichael's command was surrounded by the enemy under Colonel Biffle, at Savannah, and taking two squadrons of the Seventh Kansas, dismounted, I proceeded on the gunboats Fanny barker and Robb to his relief. Arriving there, I found the enemy gone, and after ferrying the Fifteenth over the river and confiscating nearly every contraband in the place, returned to Hamburg, and there learned that during my absence the rebels had attacked my command and had been repulsed in gallant style. Here the mountain howitzers wee of much service again, oft they were opened on the enemy and did great execution. Great praise is due Lieutenant-Colonels Phillips and Bowen for the manner in which they repulsed the enemy at this point. Lieutenant-Colonel Herrick also deserves particular mention. From the evidences of the field the enemy's loss must have been seven; ours was slight.

We finished crossing the river at 2 o'clock on Sunday morning, and at daybreak took up our march for Corinth, and reached here at about 1 p. m. In addition to the factories destroyed, we burned during the expedition some 200,000 bushels of corn; captured 69 prisoners; about 200 head of horses and mules, and about 300 contrabands of both sexes surgeon, and 3 lieutenants.

I cannot close this report without expressing my admiration and thanks-for the courage displayed and the patience and endurance manifested by my officers and men. It would be invidious to name any particular one; they all acted nobly.
