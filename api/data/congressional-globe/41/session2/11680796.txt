THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
J anuary 28,
before he made the charge thatthese many mil:
lions of surplus which served for the fiscal
year ending June, 1870, are now expended
and unavailable, and their place must be sup-
plied by appropriations for the fiscal year
1870-71. And therefore if the Administra-
tion had aimed to be only as economical in
the second year as the chairman assumes it
to have been in th# first it •would have been
obliged to ask for larger appropriations to
carry on the Government in that year, because
the surplus means, the relics of the war, was
expended. But in fact, being much more
economical than Congress asked them to be
even, they have not asked of Congress, as I
shall presently show, larger appropriations
than were had last year—even without the sur-
plus property—which was estimated by Con-
gress to be necessary to carry on the Govern-
ment in the previous year.
In order that I may present at one view the
amount of those balances, and ho*y completely
this consideration should take away all ground
for the charge of the gentleman, I call atten-
tion to the following letter:
Treasury Department, January 24,1870.
Sir: In reply to your letter of the 23d instant,
asking for the unexpended balances on the 30th day
of June, 1868,1 have the honor to inform you that
these balances were—
For the War Department $104,633,201 52
For the Navy Department   18,320,632 86
For the Indian and Pension depart-
ments  20,027,988 65
lor the civil service, including Con-
gress a*d the diplomatic fund, and
judiciary  13,444,636 82
Total $156,426,450 85
There are no "property accounts available to be
expended." 'i'heso balances are the actual money
portion of appropriations made by Congress which
remained unexpended at that, <lat«. They include
also additions made to tho appropriations from the
sale of old materials, vessels, stores, and the like,
which were originally paid for out of the appropria-
tions to which they were returned, as authorized by
Jaw, and include all moneys available for expend-
itures at that time.
I have the honor to he, very respectfully, &e.,
GE011GE S. BOUTWELL,
Hon. B. 1?. Butler, House of Representatives.
These amounts were known to Johnson's
Secretaries in December, 1868, when they esti-
mated, and although much of them might be
expended in the year ending June 30, 1860,
yet it was certain that there must be a large
surplus remaining over. Yet it will be ob-
served that these unexpended balances are only
those which appear upon the books of the
Treasury to be unexpended. There were, in
fact, large balances in the hands of disbursing
officers of the several Departments, of the
Navy, War, and Interior, which being drawn
upon requisition from the Treasury would not
appear here; and therefore, when I call atten-
tion to the several balances under separate
heads, there will not be found a perfect agree-
ment between the balances as shown by the
Department, reckoning those in the hands of
the disbursing officers with those in the Treas-
ury ; but these are enough to show how futile
in charging extravagance are the comparisons
of mere estimates with each other or estimates
with appropriations.
Let me repeat: Andrew Johnson's Secre-
taries in 1868 should have made their estimates
in view of these balances ; General Grant's
Secretaries in 1869 made their estimates with-
out any view of such balances in the Treasury,
those balances being substantially expended.
And the very book of estimates of General
Grant contains a column in which the estimates
are placed, headed "Total amount to beappro-
priated under each head in addition to the
estimated amount which will be on hand at the
beginning of the fiscal year;" while the book
of estimates of Andrew Johnson's Secretaries
contains no such column, but simply "Esti-
mates of appropriations required for the^ser-
vice of the fiscal year ending June 80, 1870."
Besides, it has been, as I understand, the aim
of General Grant's administration, so far as has
^een possible, to carry on the Government
within the appropriations made for it by Con-
gress ; and that has been conscientiously and
consistently done whenever the estimate has
been specific. But where the estimates were in
view of an unexpended balance, of coarse they
have used that balance, as in the case of the
Navy and Pension Office. But observe, they
have no w estimated for what they believe will be
exactly necessary for the use of the Govern-
ment, and by the" very form of their estimates
they propose to carry on the Government within
the amount actually appropriated, giving credit
in each estimate for the amount on hand, of
course not always including that in the hands
of disbursing officers, of the amount of which,
shifting each day, they cannot have knowledge.
WAR DEPARTMENT.
Let us now examine the estimates made by
Johnson for the War Department during the
first year of Grant's administration, which were
$65,689,338 85. There was an unexpended
balance of $6,806,234 99 in the quartermas-
ter's department; the actual appropriation
was §44,345,087 07, as shown by the book of
estimates. The total estimated expenditure
for this first year has been $44,402,807 07. Of
that $400,000 was for preservation aud repairs
of forts and service of military defenses. For
the next year the total estimate of military ap-
propriations is $38,283,061 30. In submitting
these the Secretary says:
" In the foregoing estimate the amounts originally
presented by the heads of bureaus have been mate-
rially reduced, and any appropriation smaller in
amount than that asked for would fail to meet tho
necessary wants of the Department.
" The following estimates arasubuntted separately,
and are given for the consideration of Congress, as
presented by the chicf of engineers :
For fortifications  $4,106,400 00
I'or rivers and harbors  7,961,900 00
Total  $12,158,300 00
"As to the fortifications, I urge tho appropriations
asked for tho forts near the larger cities named in tho
report of the General of tho Army, to wit: Portland,
Boston, New York, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and
San Francisco."
Estimates for these fortifications amounts to
$2,619,400; add for public buildings and
grounds and Washington aqueduct, (though
not strictly military appropriations,) $498,970;
add estimates of military appropriations (as
given above) $34,531,031 30; 'Executive (sal-
aries of Secretary of' War and employes)
$634,260; total estimate for the year ending
June 80, 1871, $38,283,661 30.
It will thus be seen that the expenditures for
the first year of General Grant's administra-
tion, estimated for by Johnson and appropri-
ated for by Congress for the War Department,
were $44,402,802 07; the estimates for the
second year were $38,283,661 30, making a
reduction of $6,119,145 70. These figures
which I give are exactly accurate, and all may
be found in the Secretary's report, all of which
were as open and accessible to the learned
chairman of the Committee on Appropriations
as to myself; and if he believed there was any-
thing wrong in the estimate, as I submit to the
House and to the country it was his duty to do,
he should have gone to the Secretary of War
for the explanation. He would at once have
got it, and saved an attack upon the Adminis-
tration of his choice and his party.
Looking on the estimates, audseeing that the
War Department is pat down as asking for
$50,000,000 while only $38,000,000 is called
for in fact, the question arises, how is this differ-
ence to be accounted for ? The answer is plain
and easy, and should have been suggested by my
colleague, and not left to me. It is made the
duty of the engineer department to furnish
estimates to Congress every year of what will
be necessary to carry to completion the fortifi-
cations already begun and ordered by Congress,
and it is also—as every member of Congress
knows—his duty to estimate what any public
work connected with rivers or harbors, or
canals, or the surveys of unexplored country,
either in progress or projected, will cost if car-
ried out, if such work shall be ordered by Con-
^ Any gentleman may rise in this House and
ask that the engineer department be called
upon to estimate what will be the cost of a
public work for the improvement of rivers and
harbors, and such estimate will be ordered.
Indeed, under both law and practice the pro-
priety of commencing no such public work can
be considered in the House until such estimate
is had. Now, in answering these requisitions
of Congress for estimates the engineer depart-
ment had estimated that all the proposed and
commenced public works, together with the
fortifications, would require $12,158,800. This
sum, added to the $38,000,000 actually called
for by the necessities of the War Department,
will more than account for the apparently in-
creased estimate over the estimate of last year,
and will show why the estimates are, in fact, so
much lower than the nominal sum put down in
the books.
Was it fair or just in my colleague to make
an attack on the Administration that the War
Department had estimated for an expenditure
of $12,000,000, when they had only answered
the requisitions of the Houses of Congress for
information as to what certain public works
would cost if ordered by Congress, especially
when they were not even recommended by the
Department? Would it not have been more
just for my friend, if he was anxious to arraign
General Grant's administration; to have com-
pared expenditure with expenditure with John-
son's? and I should have been very happy to
have had him compare President Grant's War
Department expenditure in his first year with his
second, or his first year with any other year, or
with the first year of Johnson's administration.
Let us take the War Department again, for
example : the estimates for expenditures for
the years 1868 and 1869 of the War Depart-
ment, nine months only of which were Andrew
Johnson's, were $56,761,732 60. If we add to
that old war debts paid we will bring it to
$80,664,042 70. The expenditures of the first
year of General Grant, from 1869 to 1870, as
we have seen, were $44,402,807 07'; and the
estimated expenditure for all purposes for the
next year asked for or recommended by the
Department, including $2,500,000 for fortify-
ing our principal cities, is only $38,283,661 30.
The reduction in expenditure from the last
year of Johnson to the first year of Grant -was
$12,358,925 09. The estimated reduction "of t
the expenditures of the War Department for'
the second year of General Grant's adminis-
tration is $6,119,145 70, and I trust it may
still go on. It shall not be for the want of my
vote that it does not go on.
post office department.
Now let us take the Post Office Department,
and I think there the chairman of the Com-
mittee of Appropriations will be found equally
unfortunate in his facts, and still more so be-
cause, apparently for the sake of arraigning
the Administration, he first puts forth to the
country a statement that its excessive estimates
were $49,000,000, when he had been informed
by letter of the Postmaster General, more than
sixweeks before, that nearly $12,000, OOOofthat
estimated excess was a clerical error, but had
never called upon that officer for any expla-
nation if he did not understand it. So he says,
after making the statement containing the
clerical error, " It is due to the Post Office
Department^ to say that there is an errror of
$7,000,000 in the footing, which reduces the
amount to some forty-two millions;" but not a
word of the clerical error of nearly five mil-
lions. _ Why State $49,000,000 if he meant to
state justly and fairly, and if his statement was
not the ingenious plea of an adversary of the
Administration endeavoring to fasten upon it
a charge of extravagance ? He says " faithful
are the wounds of a friend." Not those which
stab in the back.
What friendly object could my colleague have
tor parading before the country—-which was the
