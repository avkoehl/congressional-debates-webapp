CONFEDERATE CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.

WAR DEPT., ADJT. AND INSP. GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Richmond, Va., June 10, 1863.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Commanding, &amp;c., Charleston, S. C.:

GENERAL: Northern papers report the reduction of Hunter's forces by sending troops to the Gulf.

If this be true, you will, with such force as you can properly withdraw form your defensive line, proceed to Mobile to resist an attack, if one should be designed at that place; but, if the purpose of the enemy be to send his re-enforcements to the Mississippi, you will go on and co-operate with General Johnston in that quarter.

By direction of the President:

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

[JUNE 13, 1863. - For the Governor of Georgia to the Secretary of War, in reference to raising troops, see Series IV.]

CHARLESTON, S. C.,

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

Enemy's iron-clads and forces still as heretofore reported to Department, excepting a gunboat expedition reported in Altamaha, and one preparing for Saint John's River, Fla. I will prepare, as far as practicable, for contingencies referred to in Department letter of the 10th instant.

Please send me any positive information relative to movements or intentions of enemy.*

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
