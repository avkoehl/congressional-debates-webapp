APPENDIX f O TSB CONGRESSIONAL 6LOB&
Jan. 1841.
26tb Cong.-..-2nd Sess.
Pre-emption Law—Mr. Wright.
Senate.
This simple statement will show that, the whole
land revenue being retained in the Treasury, it is
a matter of reasonable doubt, whether the Go-
vernment can reach the close of 1841 with a dollar
in the Treasury, or whether there will then be found
an empty Treasury and an existing debt, and this
too without reference to the appropriations of Con-
gre$s «beyond the estimates. The sources of
supply are merely conjectural, and the slightest
disappointment, in any of the anticipated sources,
may change the balance. Then it has been usual
for Congress to exceed the estimates m its appre-
pnationsr by the sum of one and a half to three
millions of dollars, and if thatihall be the result of
the action if this session, a deficiency of means,
without a loan, ceases to be a question In any
event, the facts before Corgre*  and the country,
authorized the inference he wished to draw, that
the Treasury of the nation could spare nothing
from its resources for distribution to the States, or
for any other application, without a counterba
lacing supply cf means from some improved
source of revenue, or from loans upon the credit of
the country
This brought him back to the position he had,
from the first, been laboring to establish, viz that
a proposition to distribute, to the Staes of the
Union, the proceeds of the sales of the public
knds, nell Oi gross, in any aspect in which it can
be compared with the material facts, is but a pro-
position to distribute to those States an equal
amount oí the general revenues of the country,
whether the principle or practical effects of the
measure be considered.
In reference to this proposition, established by
faru and history, as he believed it to be, he had
but a very few remark  to mate, and as he saw he
was exceeding ihe time to which he had limited
himself th s morning, he would hasten to his con-
clusion. He wou d admit h°re, as preliminaiy to
what he was about to say in refeience to this broad
principle upon which the favors oí thij Govern-
ment were to be dispensed, that an argument
founded upon the possible abuse of a pow> r ex-
pressly granted by the Constitution was not a legi
tímate course of argument, in the field of discus-
sion. Under our system, whatever was granted to
Congress had been so granted by the States and the
people, and whatever had not been so granted was
expressly reserved to the one or the other If, then,
(his right of the States to the distribution proposed,
or the power of Congress to make it w ihout such
right, could be found m the Constitution, that
should end his resistance, as matter of principle,
and place his action upon the ground of policy
alone. But if, ai> he understood the matter, the
right of Ihe States to the money was mere conse-
quential, inferential, constructive, and drawn b)
doubtful reasoning from the deeds of cession and
the circumstances attending that act on the part of
the ceding State*, and if the powers ol Congress to
make the distribution are also consequential, infer-
enual,and constructive from the Constitution, and
rest upon the unexpressed and doubtful meaning of
ihe deeds of cession, and the still more doubtful
objects of thee cessions, he should consider an ar-
gument, drawn from the possible and probable
abuses of such a power, perfectly legitimate to
prove that it ought never to have existed, an!, if
not expressly granted, that it never ouaht to be
drawn into exercise from the most direct construc-
tion, much le s from one which is forced to leave
the Constitution it elf and go to other doubtful
sources for a resting place.
It should be borne in mmd that the po ltton was
believed to be established that the passage of the
proposition now under consideration, and making
ihe principle contained in it a law of Congres',
•would be equivalent to an assertion of the power,
on the part of Congre««, to raise revenue, by taxa
tion or otherwi«e, and to require property, whether
in lands, fortifications, ships, or in any other form,
for the purpose of distnbut ng the properly it elf,
or the proceeds of its sale, to the States, m the man-
ner now propesed.
In examining the consequences of the exercise of
such a fearful power, it will be necessaiy to mark
the manner of execution, as upon that may depend
phe form of ¿njttry and destruction to our mstitu |
'¡on . la a' y form the consequences may not be
le s fa at, while ÚV propelling power may be, in
any one form, the rever e of thai which sha'l be
the mov ng influence in all th* others
Suppose, then, as the first form of th s influence,
that ihe distributions to the States be made without
limitation as to the object of expenditure. "We
thus free the Legislatures of the States from the
odium of imposing taxes and burdens upon our
common constituents, and take that odious duty
upon oar-elves, while we leave them to dispense the
bounties to the people, which our exactions from
their pockets have furnished the means of dispens-
ing We, in effect, and in practice, convert this
Government into a tax-laym,j and tax-col ectmg
machine, o ^íous and hateful in it? action upon the
people, and sepatated from those sensibly boniheent
dispensa ions which render the mildest Govern
mciu tolerable to a free people, that we may make
the Governments of the Sutes dispenser^ of muni
ficencf only, utterly disconnected from those exac-
tions wh ch are among the necessary burdens of
all civil Government. Connect with the exercise
of this policy the idea, and the fact that this Go-
vernment exists upon the mere volition of the
Sta'es, that their p easure must sustain or termi-
na e it, and that the decimation on their part to
to send representatives into this body may, at any
time, put to an end all itsactiveand efficient powers
for good or evil, and how long would h be likely to
conn me, as a mere instrument of taxation, sepa-
rated (run the benefits which the evils of these
taxes are to dispense among, and for the bi nefit of
the tax paye s? Commence the i)s em, and where
will it be likely to end? Cin cupidity be sail fied
by g Vin0 And if not, will the benefited States be
likely to cease asking? It seemed to him that such
a policy must soon drive this Union asunder, by
leading t > loc.il eo'ifliots and a content on of rival
and sect onal int icsts, which caí only en 1 in
anarchy
Take tl e other d rec 'on of the influence Sup-
pose th s Government as une, and cm excreis*
the light to pre cube he otjjct ot expen íureofthe
money it shall distribu e to a Sta t All the land
bills have pioposed to do that, and have enume-
rated various objects, such as in ernal improve-
ments, the payment of State debts contracted for
such work-., education, the colonization of fiee
blacks, and the hit i. Under such a system of po-
licy, this Government, being the layer of the
taxes by indirection, and the direct dispenser of the
bounties, coul 1 not ful to swallow up the influ-
ence of the Sta e Governments, rei der ihem mere
bodies pol ac, without practical isli ity in the esti
tima ion of ihe | e ip'e, and finally become a con
solida el Republic and pas rapiuly thence toa
pecuniary dtspotism
Take anoth r view of this exerns' of the p-^wer,
and see if this consequence can be avo ded Taxa-
tion for distributes is ihe pol.cy The fun! is to
be exi ended upon internal improvements-, roads
canals, ind the like All such works must be «note
or less 1 cal, and the peculiar coidition of one
Sta enny render them of great serv c<* to its bust
ness, most important o ib comrrerce, and, as a
consequence of these and o h r advantpges, the
means of enhancing the value of its soil and i ther
property in an important degne, while anotl er
State miy be so s uated a  to present few facilities
for such impro\emen!s So between different
classes ofciti/ens, differently situated, in the sa*ne
State One ol iss may be located with ther pro-
perty near the pioposed improvement , and another
cla^s-, with an equal amount of propelty, may be so
remote, or ctherwise so sitúa e 1, that they will not
only not receive positive benefit, but relative in-
jury, from he proposed public work Yet all are
to be taxed, and m a legal sense equally taxed, for
the fund to be distribu ed. He said m a legal
sense equally taxed, because, although he did not
propose, i pon th s oocas'on, to go into a disquisi-
tion upon th?t po nt, he thought it would be easy to
show that the mo !e of taxation by duties upon im-
ports, if carried to an extreme, and for purposes of
expenditure such as this argument contemplates,
not'only might but must be most unequal, unjust,
and oppressive
Who are to be benefiied m interest by the roads
and canals to be constructed? The holders of pro-
perty, of lands, of houses, of lo s, and tne trading
and commercial men of the country direcdy. The
laboring poor man indirectly and unimportantly, if
at all. Take a case A tax is imposed upon tea,
coffee and sugar, for the purpose of raising a fund
to construct improvements of this character, or,
what is the same thing in principle and effect, to
make up to the Trea ury the deficiency of the land
revenue taken fiom it for that purpose. A B is a
man of proper y, an extensive land holder, a mer-
chant, or trader, whose business and property are
to be directly and materially benefited by the ex-
penditure of the tax upon a canal, or railroad, and
ht payo the tax cheerfully, and seeks to have it
raised. C Dua caitman, whose whole worldly
effects are his horse, cart, and harness. The value
of them cannot be miter ahy increased by any
road or canal, while their utility to him, and the
business upon which he depends, may be destroyed
by either These two citi/ens have the sama fami-
lies to support. Wtat will be their respec-
tive proporti ins of tax upon the articles named
of tea, ~ coffee and sugai' He was aware
that it bad been, at a former day, and perhaps
might be with «ome now, fashionable to call these
articles luxuries, and therefore legitimate objects of
taxation, but m his understanding they had become,
by the habits of our peoph, as truly necessaries as
any articles of importa ion They were in com
mm and con tant use by all clashes of our citizen",
the wealihy unqaes íonably making a more free
use of them than the poor and dependent Still,
in the case he nad supposed, the amount of tax
paid upon these article  would be nearly equal be-
tween tl e t \o families while there would be no
co upariion between ihe amrunt of property of
each, Ihe amount of benefits to each to be derived
from the prosecution of a system of internal lm-
frwemenis by canals, i"i lioads, and the line, or
between the taxss tlxy would be compelled to pay
tor the construction of such works, if equally as-
sessed upon pr perty What must ba the conse-
quence of the presreunon of such a policy through
the lamng power of thu Go/ernmeit thus indirect-
ly extrc st-d? Coul 1 u fail to divide the communi-
ty into classes and localities? To induce him who
was the owner of property to be benefited by the
proposed improvements, to strive to increase the
taxes upan all, and thus swell the fund for distribu-
tion, while he who had no property, and would
reap comparatively little b nefi , being compelled
to pay a nearly equal amount of the tax with his
rich neighboi, would oppo e the policy, and feel
himse f oppressed by it1 Would not the owner of
p-operty so snuat d as to receive little benefit,
or re'itive injury, from 'uch work , feel that the
rule cf equ tl taxation, «prlied to him, and to the
rain fchose property and business were direcily
benefited, was unequal and unjust? In a direct as-
sessment upon property the valuations would
equalize the burden? Not «o when the tax should
be indirect and equal, accorttngjo the necessaries
and conveniences of life consumed Was it not
apparent, from tHe<e brief suggestions, that such a
policy must set t1 e community at variance, and
produce strifes the most dangerous to any well re-
gulated society, tuose strifes which personal and
pnvate interests engender?
There was sdll another aspect in which this po-
licy m ght be viewed, even more frightful and d a-
jurbmg It it was competent for Congre s to di-
rect the expenditure of the fund to be distributed to
any extent, it could do so to every extent. If its
powers could control the State Legislatures in
their application of it, the same powers would en-
able Congress to apply it without the intervention
of iho^e Legislatures at all, not infringing upon the
territory and j urisdic ion of the State If Congress
could ttec are ihat the money should be devoted to
the purooses of education, it could distribute it to
the particular schools, or, per capita, upon the scho-
lars taught If this could be cc nstitutionally done,
the same power would extend to a distribution of
money per capí'a to the whole population of the
country for any specified purpose, or for the use ef
the recipients at pleasure. Establish this power in
this Government, and then admit, what cannot be
denied, that if Congress can raise money by impose
