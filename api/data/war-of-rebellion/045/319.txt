S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

UNION MILLS, VA., June 25, 1863.

(Received 8. 20 p. m.)

Major T. T. ECKERT:

Heavy firing has been heard for a couple of hours in the direction of Wolf Run Shoals, both musketry and artillery. Only an occasional shot is heard now, but it is very distant, apparently not more than 3 miles off. I was told a few minutes ago that the rebels had attacked two of our batteries on the way from Bristoe to Fairfax Station. Have not heard result.

J. D. FINNEY,

Operator.

The commanding general directs that you hold your command in readiness to march in the direction of Edwards Ferry. Hancock will be at Gum Springs to-night. The first, Third, and Eleventh Corps will cross the river to-day. No supplies will be sent up to you to-day, unless you absolutely need them. You can draw at Edwards Ferry. Answer.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

FAIRFAX STATION, June 25, 1863.

(Received 8. 40 p. m.)

Major ECKERT:

Brigadier-General Tyler informs me that the enemy are in position with a battery on the other side of Wolf Run Shoals, shelling the woods on this side. Adjutant-General Williams telegraphs the operators at Union Mills to leave immediately.

GRAHAM,

Operator.

HARPER'S FERRY,

June 25, 1863-6 p. m.

General HOOKER:

That portion of the rebel troops passing by Boonsborough are evidently taking the route by Emmitsburg into Pennsylvania. A. P. Hill's division passed Sharpesburg this morning direct for Hagerstown.

TYLER.
