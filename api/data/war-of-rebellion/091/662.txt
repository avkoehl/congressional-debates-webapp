HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE EAST,

New York City, November 22, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have the following reliable information: There are about forty rebels in Marysburg, Price Edward Country, Canada, on the north side of Lake Ontario and northwest of Oswego. They drill about three times a week and are armed with revolvers. They board with farmers in the neighborhood, seem to have plenty of money, and say that belong to John Morgan's corps. These organizations for hostile purpose on Canadian soil are so plainly in violation of all the obligations of neutrality that I cannot doubt the willingness of the Canadian authorities to put an end to the on proper notice. There are some indications if retaliation on the part of our citizens along the frontier on account of the outrages on the Detroit River and at Saint Albans, and I think the publication of my report with regard to the former will have a salutary influence on both sides of the line.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
