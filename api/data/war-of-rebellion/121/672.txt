him by the said Captain Morfit, as he alleged, for safe-keeping. Major Carrington has delivered said money to the provost-marshal-general of the Department of Virginia. He also gave information which led to the arrest of Captain Morfit. We find no evidnece of a collusion between Carrington and Morfit for the purpose of defrauding Federal prisoners of their money, nor do we find evidence of any ddishonorable act on the part of said Carrington. We therefore reespectfully recommend that he be releassed from arest.
