I therefore write to ask that you will make demonstration on the railroad, but not cross it. It will give me an opportunity of crossing. Have written to Russell, in command of the unarmed men, not to move at all, but to keep his men together and locate where he can get forage,&amp;c., for his command.

I hope, therefore, that you will engage the attention of the enemy until I effect the crossing.

N. B. FORREST,

Brigadier-General.

G. W. HOLT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

RICHMOND, December 23, 1863.

Lieutenant Gen. J. LONGSTREET,

Bean's Station, via Bristol:

What are the circumstances which caused your application to place General Ransom in command of Hood's division, and who have you in view to replace Ransom in his present command?

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
HDQRS. DEPT. WESTERN VIRGINIA AND EAST TENNESSEE, Dublin, December 23, 1863.

Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON,Secretary of War, Richmond:

Lieutenant-General Longstreet telegraphed me from Bean's Station on the 17th he had taken Major-General Ransmon's command with him to that point under authority, as he conceived, of the President, and declined sending me the portion of the command I had called for. I think it very important that there should be an additional force of this line, especially near the salt-works, and respectfully suggest that at least that portion of Wharton's brigade now with Ransom be ordered to Glade Springs without delay.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
