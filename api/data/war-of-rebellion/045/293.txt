Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, Washington:

Captain Alexander, of the Baltimore Light Battery, is waiting in Washington for guns, which I greatly need. General Ripley, I understand, will not issue Wiard rifle guns to him without your approval. I had a battery of the Wiard steel guns all last year in the field, and found them very good. I hope you will authorize the issue.

Baltimore, June 24, 1863-1. 50 p. m.

Major-General COUCH, Harrisburg, Pa.:

Have heard nothing of any body of deserters such as you inquire about. A telegram this morning from the Monocacy says enemy reported by citizens in large force-cavalry, infantry, and artillery-half way between Boonsborough and Middletown, 12 miles from Frederick. Nothing definite, as they parole all persons passing through their lines. A scouting party in that direction will report from the Monocacy at 2 this p. m.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.
