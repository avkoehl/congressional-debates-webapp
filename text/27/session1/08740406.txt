five dollars apiece, nearly as much, as England
Adam Smith's false metaphor, explaining the influence of
paper money, (and he never dreamed of any nut actually con-
verttbiey) h is giren rise to much misappiehension Gold and
sliver, he says, are the' highways which cany the corn and
grass of a country to market, without producing any of either
Whereas/wí&cioMS banking, by what he owns is ^violent meta-
phor, is a sort of wagon way through the air, enabling a country
to canvert its highways into pastures and cornfields, and in
creaste the produce of land and labor. This who'e fancy of the
father  of the science, he confesses  is not of much reliance
The Dradahan wtnga which he puts to a wagon, and that upon
a «?«^inthe «ir, violent as the metaphors are would afford, he
owns, less secure travel ing than the solid giound of gold and
silver; and, besides liab Iity co accidents from unskilful conduc-
to s of paper money, are exposed to others which no skill or
prudence can guar J against The irresistible temptations to
systematic frauds, the shocking destructivenpss, and the fatal
explosions, of suspending banks, were not contemplated by
Smith Nor, in tueir mere economy, did he consider the ques-
tion of theforeign worthfessness of paper money, and «is mva
riabTe tendency, whenever excess ve, to send coir abroad to buy
the luxuries a people does not want It never makes plenty,
but for the immediate reaction of searci y The stock ofspecie
which it may displace, does not remain ia the country, but is
Sent away for foreign luxuries, if not on wanton speculation
Again Tne credit system and the tpaper money system,
commonly confounded, areas totally different as the mcalcula
b!e hundreds of millions of do lar« which beloig to ere ¡its for
all the innúmera le occasions oí business and the infini ely
smaller, huwevei exaggerated, amoun of bank cceclits which
are, in fact, the direst ¡oe of the credit system B ink credit has
driven individual credit, the former capital of the young, en
terpnsmg, and industrious, from the market The only real
effect of paper money is to cause so mush good money to be
sentabroad, to return to this country in excessive importations
of foreign manufactures, which we take for money, and must
pay for in money, aftei expeihrg the money and deprivingour
selves of the only means of payment By these absiud con
tnvances we now owe more man twice as much as a 1 the mo
nay in the United States Supposing American banks íst>ue
but thrice their com capital, the effect wu¡ t be to withdraw ore
third of the specie m cucuiation, to be supplied by bank notes.
But the supplanted coin will not remain idle m (he bank* or m
the country. Money is a commodity m marke' like others If
it falls below its foreign price it goes abroaJ where wt rth more,
i-'ivmg here only thepapei or coun erfeit repiesentatmn of it,
wnich foreigners will not take as money, while we do Su h
is thejudgment of all those who, like Adam nmlth have deve-
loped economy as a science But ignorance and ¿vaneo still
t mmph over them, controlling and convulbing common
wealths.
Tne degenerate dogma that England and this country owe
their superior prosperity to paper money, or bunks, or int orpo
rated industry, isdisgracelul to the fieemen w io but dishonor
and disown their birthright Long before a baik, oi abwk
note, or piper money, were ever thought of, Erigían i was com
paratively as superior to other nations as now Liberty, law
and comfort reudered hei so Tortescue, m bis praise of Eig
lishlaws, addressed to Prince Edwaul manv a_es before the
Bank of England, contrasts the miseras of French peasantry
withthe emoyme us of English yeomanry The English were
represented in a Parliament, he says, the courts of justice were
opentothera, they were rn.ru  gold and silver, ha 1 plenty to
e it and dunk, were well clithet and hou^el, n me of which
were French means ot prosperity Contemplating the still and
much greater liberty, industry and comfini oi tin country
aid connecting them with cheap land untaxed necessaues and
a'most uninterrupted peace it is the lunacy of avarice to im
p ite individual and national happiness to their greatest detn

Nations aie much affected by each o her's currency, espe-
cially such as the United States, Great Britain, frame, and
S¡ am, having great international c > ntnerce The money of
ona may be solid while that of another is evanescent, yet they

Union cannot bo properly appremted withoj' sketches of us

Want of money, caused by bad government, occasioned the
financial distiess which engendered the stupendous revolution
of France, and it is incredible how inconsiderable the dificit
n said by the royahsts to have been which provoked gigantic
Republicanism In the third year of it=i delirium, when the
whole kingdom was cowed by a small minority of demagogues,
the convulsed Government threw itself on the intoxicating re
lief of paper money, which soon btought the peonle to rum
«tnd dis.tr icuoi Mire than half the real estate ot France, pa
laces, parks, forests monasteries, plantations, every thing of
substantial pioperty, was t onfHC ite J from the impute! mort
mam ol religious oiders, princes, nobles and emigrants, and
setup at public sa!e3, like our wild lands m the United Sates
Forty two milhar is of assignats, land scrip, equal to eight
hundred and forty millions of dollars, were issued and abro id
ii desperate deprecia ion The precious metals vanished
Government money fell to one thousand, in paper secured by
ite pledge and that of the best real estate, for one m gold
or silver Copper was worth more thin public ciedit thus
apparently well secured
American continental money, and forciblerequisUions at fixed
prices by martial law, savored offeobively enough of Revolu
inaary violence But the paper money tyranny of the French
Revolution, as desc-ibed by Thiers's History, was a great ex
aterbationof American despair It was suggested a  Pans that

seized,and sold at the requisnon of the Revo! ltionarv Con1
mittees, and themselves be regarded as suspicious persons
1 he shopkeeper clerks, attorneys, grocers, and others opposing
this scheme, were denounced by Marat as aristocrats tor
Bpmng with the rich, who ough' to be arrested, and reduced to
he condition oí sans culott s> stripped of wherewithal to cover
their posteriors Chaumette, the common serjeant, suggested
that an assembly should be formed, consisting of the Presidents
of the RevolutionaiyC'ubs tomeeteveij fcunday and Thurs
day,to takeorder on the dangers of the Commonwealth, and
that all good citizens should be invited to j *m them Finally,
Danton, always femle of expedients on critical occasions, pro
posed that ad these sans cmottes members of the universal
anarchy, should be paid a daily allowance for the time devoted
to public service
The whole of the evils afflicting the Republic could not be
known, by contemplating only the five < r &ix fields of battle on
which human blood was flowing The interior offered a
spectacle quite as deploiable Gram was always scarce and
dear People were fighting at the baker's doors for a morsel
of bread They disjuted in vain with the shopkeepers to
make them take assignats for articles of the first necessity
buffering was at its Í eight The people complained of fore
stallers who withheld provisions oí stockjobbers who en
haoced their price, and discredited assignats by their dealing
The Government, as wretched as the people, had also nothing
but assignats to exi*t upon, which it was necessary to give in
three or four times the quantity to pay the same services, and
which it was a raid to issue for fear of i educing them still
lower There was no knowing therefore, how to keep either
Government or people agoing any longer
Still general production h d not decreased France was not
wanting ingram, nor common product', nor manufactured ar
tides, but their equal and peaceable distribution was be
come impossible by the effec s of paper money The
Revolution which, w nle abolishing monarchy, desnrd
never helees to pay it* i ebi^, whieh m de<ur tying t' o
venality oi offices, had engaged to reimhuise the value
of them, w in n in def n ns the new oider of things

clergy and the emigiants, with which to make head againn all
demands Inordei to put in circulation tne value of this pro-
perty, it had imagined ass gnats, which were the representa
tions of it. and winch by means of purchases weie to return to
tne treasury, and be burnt But at. the euccetsof the Revolu*
tion, and the validity of thes sales were doubted, the proj erty
was not bought The assignats -emained m circula ion, like a
bill of exchange not accepted, depreciated by doubt and over-
issue

that is, exchanged a certain quantity of silver or gold against a

ingiapidiy In June a metal fianc was worth three francs in
asignáis, and in August, two months afterwards, a silvc r franc
was worth six francs in assignats In this state oí things,
traders refused to gi?e then goods for the same price as be
hrc because the money they weie offered had but a fifth or
sixth of its lonnervaluf Thev shut them up therefore, and
refusedthemto purchasers Without doubt, this decrease in
value would have been an incorvemen e of no account to the
assignats if every one rece vine-thern for only what they were
worth had taken and given them at the sime rate In that
case they mi°ht always have pe'foimed the functions of the
sign m exchmces, anl seivei for circulation like any other
money But capitals <= who lived on their income, publiecre
fliiors who leceived eithet an annual rent or official emolí
menta, were obliged to take papei atiH nominal value Ail
debtors were anxious for acquittance and ci editors, obliged to
take afi titious value got but the fourth, the fifth, or The <*ixrh
of then capital Fmally, woiking people, always constrained
toproffei then services, to give them to whoever would take
them, unable to act in concert, so as to double or tieble their
pay as assignats fell m those proportions, received butpartof
what was necessary for them to get objects of need m ex
change The capitalists, half rumed, were discontented and
taciturn, but the furious people called these traders who
would not sell at the common price, torestallers, and reqmred
that forciallers should be senttothegulloiine
This latal condition wa& the result of the creation ofassigna's,
as asignara were bi ought about by the necessity of paying old
debts, offi e holders, and a ruinous war, and for the same rea
sen, the maximum wasthe resultof at-signats It would have
been of little importance to render this money compulsory, if
the dealer, by íaismghis prices, could avoid the necessity of re-
ceiving ir It was necessary to fix a forced price of goot's as well
as of money AshO>nas the law said paper is worth mx fiancs
uhad to say «men goods are woithonl/ six francs for other
wise, the dealers, by raising them to twelve, would escape the
exchange It was necessary, therefore, m spite of excellent
reasons drawn from ordmaiy economy, to fix a maximum for
gram Ihe people's greatest suffering was want of bread
I here was no want of corn, but the farmers, who would not
face the uproar of market, nor part with corn at the rate
ofassfgnats concealed themselves with their produce The lit-
tle grain w'pch appeared was quickly canted off by the town
corpoiationsoi by individuals induced by fear to make provision
of it I>ea th was fe t more m Pans than any other city of
France, because thesupply of that immense city was more dif
ficult, the maikets more tumultuous, and the farmers feais
greater The conven ion could not help making a decree by
which all farmu-s or «Valéis m srain were obliged to declare
the quantity of corn they possessed, to thrash what was m
sheaf, to bring i to maiket, and exclusively to market, and to
sell it at a mean pnce fiW by each town corporation, accoid
mg to prior pi ces \o one was to buy more than a month's
supply Such as hoi ght at a price below the maximum
were punished with t onfixca ion and penalties Domicil aiv
visits were established to &•* erfam fací* moreover a report of
all the declarations was to be sent by the municpalmes to the
Minister of the Interior from which to make a general statis
tical statement of the food of the whole country The corpora
tion of Paris superadding its ordinances to the deciees of the
convention, had besides regulated the distribution of bread at
the bikenes No one could go there without a card of surety
delivered bv the Revolutionary Committees, on which wag in-
seabed the quantity of bread to be asked for and that propor-
tioned to thenuraber of individuals m each family Even the
mannei oí tailing each othei at the bakers' doors was regulated
A rope was fastt ned to thedoor,which eich ene laid hold of, so as
not to lo&e his place, and toprevent confusion Butmiechiev
ous women often cut the rope—fughtful tumults ensued—and
it required armed force <o restore order Thus we perceive to
what immense troubles a Government is condemned, and into
what vexatious measures it is drawn, whenever obliged
to regulate every thing In such a condition, each re
quirement begets another Forcing the circulation of assignats
led to forcing, the exchanges, to fencing prices, to forcing even
the quantity, houi, and mode of purchases, the Ia«t resulted
from the first, and the first was as inevitable as the Revolution
i tself
Thedeamessoffood, which brought about the maximum, ex
tended to eveiy thing of the firn necessity Meat, vegetables,
fruit, groceries, light fuel, drmks, clothing, shoe leather, eveiy
thing grew dear as assignats depreciated, and the people con
tinually persisted m discovering more forestalled, where theie
were only dealers refusing worthless money By Marat's ad
vice they pillaged the grocers, and they pillaged the soap boats
which arrived'at Paris by the Seine Ihe severest measures
were demanded against traders A priest stirred up a mob of
priests, ir order to get an article inserted in the Constitution
against forestallers There was great indignation against stock-
jobbers, who were said to make goods dear by speculating m
assignats, üold, silver, and foreign paper Popular imagina-
tion created monsters everywhere and ferocious enemie*., while
there were none but creedy cheats taking advantage of the dis
<-e*o, but not producing it, and certainly without powei to pro-
duce it.
Depreciation of assignats proceeded from a crowd of causes
then great qi amity, the uncertainty of then seem ty, which
must fail if the Revolution did not succeed, their comparison
with specie whith did not lose iu reality and with good* which,
re aimng the*r value, could not be got for n oney which had
lost its value Capitalists would noi keep funde m assignats,
because in that way they were penshu g every day At first
they endeavored to procure silver but six years of constraint
alarmed the buyers and sellers ofspecie They then turned
their attention to goods but they offered a transient mvesimeatj
because they could mt be kept long anda d nfferous invest-
ment, because the rape acam&t forestallers was at us height.
They therefire looked out for securities m for ign countries
All the holders of aosisna s strove to get bi la of exchange on
Amsterdam, London, Hambu g, Genoa, ai y part of Europe
They gave enormous na .o^at value 'or these fireign val es,
and thus degiaded assignats bv deserting hern Some of these
assigns s were realise f out of France ar d tne value of them re
ceived by emigran s Magnifirent fi rniture, the spoils of for
mer luxury consisting m cab net ware, clocks, mirrors, gilded
bronzes, porcelain, picture^, precious editions, paid for tt ese
bills of exchange, tra srnuted into guineas and ducats But no
attempt was made to real ze more than the smallest part of
them Sought aftei by terrified capitalists, unwilling to emi
grate but devious only of givmc a solid guarantee for their
fortunes, they almost all remained wher ver the most alarmed
sent them to one another 1 hey thus foi med a particular mass
of capml quaianteed xhroaJ, and rivalling the assigi ats
There is reason to believe that Pitt 'got English capitalists to
sign a great quantity of this paper and tver opened a conside
rabie ciedit for ihem to increase the mass ofit, ?nd contribute,
m this way, more and more t> the diseredit of assignats
Great eigemess was also di&played to proeme the bills of
stock companies, which seemed to be beyoi d the reach of the
revolution an 1 counterrevolution, and offerea, moreover, an
advantageous investment Those of the Com pany of Discount
were in ereat favor, but tho^e of the India company were
sought after with the greatest avidity, because they rested, in
some measure, on an inaccessible pledge, this hypothecation
consisting of vessels and stores situated all over the globe It
was in vain they were subjected to a considerable transfer duty;
the directors evaded the law by abolishing scrip, and replacn g
it by meie informal entry on 'he books of the company Thus
they defiauded the State of a considerable revenue for many
thousand transfers a day were made, and they rendered useless
the precautions takpn to prevent brokerage In vain, also, m
order to diminish the attraction of these bills, were their pi o
ceeds subjected to a duty of five per cent The dividends were
distributed among the holders as reimbursement of part of the
capital, by which stratagem the directors once more evaded
the law Thus, from 600 francs, these bills rose to 1,000,1,200,
and even 2,000, wl ich wab so much value opposed to the revo
lutionary money, operating to di>rredit it Not only were all
these sorts of funds opposed to asígnate, but certain parts of
the public debt, and even other private a^signats There ex
isted, m fact, loans subscribed at all times, and m every form
Some went as far back as Loui^ XIII Among the more
recent, subscribed under Louis XVI, there were different
eceduons of them Those anterior to the constitutional
monarchy were geneially preferred to those which had
oeen opened for the wants of the Revolution Eveiy body was
opposed to the assignats, hypothecated on the property ef the
clergy and the emigrants And differences wert, made between
the assignats themselves Of about five milliards issued since
the creation, one millnrd was got in by pmchases of national
property Neaily four milhaids remained in circulation, of
which might be reckoned five hundied millions created under
Louis XVI, and bearing the royal stamp These latter, it was
said, would fare bettei m case of a counter revolution, and be
taken for at least a part of their value, so that they passed for
ten or fifteen per cent moie than the others The republican
assignats, the only ie«ouice of the Government, the only mo
ney of the people, were thus completely disci edited, and had to
struggle at the same time against specie, goods, fore;gn paper,
the tcnp of the stock companies, the various State ci edits, and
finally the royal ass gnats The reimbursetnent of offices, the
payment of large supplies made fo the State for war demands,
the eagerness of many d&btois to be exonerated, produced
gieat collec ions of funds ir certain hands War and the dread
of a terrible revolution, had interrupted numeious commercial
opeiations, brousht about laige settlements, and etill further
augmented the mass of stagnant capital seeking security This
capital, thus accumulated was subjected to perpetual brtiker
age at the Pans Exchange, changed by turns into g< Id, silver,
provisions, bills of exchange, stocks, old State contract , &c
Those venturesome gamblers of course intervened, who throw
themselves upon all sons of hazards, speculate on the chances
of commerce, the supplies of armies, tne faith of Government,
