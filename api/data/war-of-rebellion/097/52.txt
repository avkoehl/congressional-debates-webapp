no doubt that this is essentially correct. The Sentinel says that the pleasant rumors yesterday from the south were not without foundation, and there is reason to hope for the reason to hope for the reception of still more cheering intelligence before the expiration of the week.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., March 20, 1865-12 noon.

Brigadier General D. H. RUCKER,

Chief Quartermaster:

Sheridan has some 2,000 poor horses to send from White House to Washington. I have sent several transports there for this purpose. He has plenty of subsistence and forage to last until he can join these armies by land. We want our fresh artillery and cavalry horses as early as possible. Please hurry them forward, and the empty transports can return by White House. Were those North River barges chartered? We need such vessels very much.

RUFUS INGALLS,

Brigadier-General and Chief Quartermaster.

CITY POINT, VA., March 20, 1865.

Colonel S. L . BROWN,

Quartermaster-General's Office:

General Sheridan's cavalry, now at White House, will probably join us. I am feeding his horses now with forage sent from here. The number of animals will be largely increased; provide forage accordingly. We are entirely out of hay, and it is wanted now more than ever; do hurry it forward. The bran has not arrived; it would do great good, and is daily called for; we could use 500 tons of it.
