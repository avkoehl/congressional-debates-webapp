Infantry; third, three batteries to be selected by you from the Army of Kentucky; fourth, the Second Michigan and Ninth Pennsylvania Cavalry; fifth, four regiments from West Virginia, under Brigadier-General Crook; sixth, Reid's brigade, including one battery; seventh, the Twelfth and Sixteenth Kentucky Infantry; eighth, the Seventy-eighth Illinois Volunteer Infantry, and, ninth, the Sixth and Ninth Kentucky Cavalry.

The above force is to be under your command, and will be assembled, with the least possible delay, at Louisville, and proceed thence by steamers to Nashville, via the Cumberland River. No wagons will be taken, as General Rosecrans has a surplus of transportation.

Possibly it may be best to march the cavalry across the country to Nashville, instead of transporting by boat, and in the event of the railroad being put in working order from Elizabethtown to Nashville in time, it may be best to send a part of the infantry forces by that route. On your arrival at Nashville you will report to Major-General Rosecrans, commanding the Department of the Cumberland.

The following general officers will be assigned to your command, in addition to General Baird: First, Brigadier General H. M. Judah; second, Brigadier General S. P. Carter; third, Brigadier General C. C. Gilbert; fourth, Brigadier General George Crook.

The command of the District of Central Kentucky will be turned over to Brigadier General Q. A. Gillmore.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
