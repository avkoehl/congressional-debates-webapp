HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF CENTRAL MISSOURI,Jefferson City, Mo., September 30, 1864.

E. G. TOOTE, Esq.,

Warrensburg, Mo.:

SIR: There are no arms here to issue. I ordered fifty stand sent from Sedalia, which, with those you have and double-barreled guns besides already in the hands of the citizen guards, will have to answer, as I cannot get any more now until the Enrolled Missouri Militia are armed. I send you an order to take command of citizen-guard organizations in Johnson County, with a list of the commanding officers. As Shelby is reported moving in force in this direction, and will soon be in the western portion of the State, a concentration will become necessary in order to be effective and prevent the rebels taking the arms of the citizen guards. I send you 2,000 buckshot cartridges, for which make requisitions and send to me for approval.

Yours, very truly,

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.
