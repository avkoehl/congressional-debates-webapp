It will be seen that the losses are quite severe; but when it is remembered that we suffered very severely at Resaca, and have been kept almost constantly operating in the front and on one or the other flank of the army ever since, they are not at all greater than might have been expected. We have to lament the loss of many gallant officers and men, but in return for it we can point to some of the most substantial results achieved by any division of the army. For a more minute account of the operations of the division, I respectfully refer you to the accompanying reports of brigade, regimental, and battery commanders. Accompanying will also be found a complete list, by name and rank, of all the casualties sustained and also a list, by name and rank, of all prisoners captured and deserters from the enemy that have given themselves up to the division.*

I cannot with justice close this report without acknowledging the very able and efficient support I have at all times received from my brigade commanders. Since I have had command of the division I have had seven different brigade commanders, to-wit: Brigadier-General McLean; Colonel Joseph A. Cooper, Sixth Tennessee (now brigadier-general); Colonel John R. Bond, One hundred and eleventh Ohio; Colonel Silas A. Strickland, Fiftieth Ohio; Colonel John C. McQuiston, One hundred and twenty-third Indiana; Colonel Peter T. Swaine, Ninety-ninth Ohio Volunteer Infantry; and Colonel William E. Hobson, Thirteenth Kentucky. To al of these I acknowledge my great obligations, and to their efforts is due a great share of the success which has attended our operations. Colonel Cooper has already, upon my recommendation, received the promotion he has so richly and signally earned on this campaign, he having been already appointed a brigadier-general by the President. Each of the other colonels mentioned above are richly deserving such promotion, and have my most hearty recommendation. It is not probable, however, that the division will be entitled to so great a number of promotions. I deem it particularly my duty to recommend Colonel John R. Bond, One hundred and eleventh Ohio Volunteer Infantry, and Colonel Silas A. Strickland, Fiftieth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, who, in connection with Brigadier- General Cooper, are the regular brigade commanders of the division; both of these colonels have fairly earned promotion by assiduous attention to duty and conspicuous gallantry in action. There are other officers in the divis-
