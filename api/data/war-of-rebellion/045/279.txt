June 24, 1863-12. 40 a. m.

General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Forty pontoons and equipage started from here at 10. 15 p. m., to hurry through the Georgetown locks. At this hour, 32 more pontoons and equipage, the balance for 1, 450 feet of bridge, have started, as I have judged it safest to send all from here. I expect the bridge to reach the Monocacy on the evening of the 24th. I send my train mules to tow them, which will leave me animals for one complete bridge train only.
