APPENDIX TO THE . CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[December 4,
Ho. of Reps.
Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
39tii Gong....1st Sess.
tcm of taxation it need not be oppressive. It
is, however, a debt. While it is capital to the
holders of the securities, it is still a national
debt, and an incumbrance upon the national
estate. Neither its advantages nor its burdens
are or can be shared or borne equally by the
people. Its influences are anti-republican. It
adds to the power of the Executive by increas-
ing Federal patronage. It must be distasteful
to the people because it fills the country with
informers and tax-gatherers. It is dangerous
to tlie public virtue, because it involves the col-
lection and disbursement of vastsums of money,
and renders rigid national economy almost im-
practicable. It is, in a word, a national bur-
den, and the work of removing it—no matter
how desirable it may be for individual invest-
ment—should not be long postponed.
As all true men desire to leave to their heirs
unincumbered estates, so should it be the am-
bition of the people of the United States to
relieve their descendants of this national mort-
gage. We need not be anxious that future gen-
erations shall share the burden with us. Wars
arc not at an end, and posterity will have enough
to do to take care of the debts of their own
creation.
Various plans have been suggested for the
payment of the debt, but the Secretary sees no
way of accomplishing it but by an increase of the
national income beyond the national expend-
itures. In a matter of so great importance as
this, experiments are out of placc. The plain
beaten path of experience is the only safe one
to tread.
The first step to be taken is, to institute
measures for funding the obligations that are
soon to mature. The next is, to provide i'or
raising, in a-manner the least odious and op-
pressive to tax-payers, the revenues necessary
to pay the interest on the debt, and a certain
deimite amount annually for the reduction of
the principal. The Secretary respectfully sug-
gests that on this subject the expression of Con-
gress should be decided and emphatic. It is
of the greatest importance, in the management
of a matter of so suipussing interest, that the
right start should be made. Nothing but rev-
enue will sustain the national credit, and noth-
ing less than a fixed policy for the reduction of
the public debt, will be likely to prevent its in-
crease.
On the 31st day of October, 38G5, since which
time no material change has taken place, the
public debt, without deducting funds in the
Treasury, amounted to $2,808,510,437 55, con-
sisting of the following items:

mencement of the next fiscal year. This ex-
plains the difference between §18,842,558 71,
