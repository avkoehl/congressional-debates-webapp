THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 25,
never rested on a more solid basis than at this
time.
He had been informed from sources in which he
" placed the most implicit reliance, that drafts on the
North could readily be obtained from the Bank of
Cape Pear at the small premium of a qua ter per
cent ,that being on terms as favorable as the Uni-
ted States Bank had ever transacted business of
that kind so fai as he was informed This fact
afforded abundant proof, not only of the entire
competency of the State banks to conduct the fiscal
concerns of the Government, but of their ability to
afford the same facilities to the commercial inter-
ests in eanying on the business of exchange be
tween distant portions of the Union, as those
afforded at any time heietofore by the Bank of the
United States
Mr B said that every meam which ingenuity
could devise, had been industriously seized on and
dexterously used by political partisans, to with
draw the true question at issue,and to make erro
rteous impressions on the public mmd I he oppo-
nents of the Administration, well awaie that the
conduct of the bank cannot stand the test of scru-
tiny before the public eye, wnh that skill and
addiess which have often been íesoited to with
advantage m militaiy opeiutions, seek on every
occasion which pitsents itself to make a diversion
in favor of the bank, by attacking the acts of the
Executive, and misrepresenting both his conduct
and his motives Mr B said, that for himself, he
should keep steadily in view the great question
which he considered really at issue, which was,
whether the pretensions set up by an arrogant
moneyed aristocracy, and the political paity sup
porting it, should prevail in the conflict, or whether
the ceuse of the country, and the Chief Executive
Magistrate who was defending the citadel of our
liberties against the most dangerous assaults,
should be sustained
On'motion of Mr WILKINS, the memorial
was laid upon the table

Mr  JARVIS asked the unanimous consent of
the House to take up the resolution offered by
him  foi   a select committee to mquue into the
causes of the suspenoion of specie payments by
die banks in the Distnct which have suspended,
as well as foi an mqu-ry into the condition of the
Bank of the Metro| oils
Objections hiving been made,
Mr JARVIS moved a suspension of the rule,
to enable him to have the lesolution consideied
The motion prevailed—ayes 89, noes 34
The resolution was then read, and
Mr HARDlN,who had the floorfrom the pre
viousday, resumed      He disclaimed having said,
as he was rep,esented to have done, m some re
maiks on this subject, made in one of the news
papers,, that all the banks, including the Bank of
the Metropolis, were insolvent    What he had
said was, that if íefeience was had to the security
of the notes and bills discounted by each of them,
each was solvent, but that apart fiom that, neither
they nor  the Bank of the   Metropolis could  be
considered solvent    Concurring entnely, he said,
m the piopuety of what fell from the honorable
membei fiom Indiana, [Mr  Lane ] that no bank
should be continued as a depository of the public
money, into whose affairs iheie would be any
hesitation on their part, to permit inquiry, he pro
ceeded 'o lead from the íepoit of the Secietary of
the lieasuiy on this subject, a statement of the
public money deposited in the several State banks
since  then   removal,  and   a  statement of their
resources, which, he argued, went to show that
they had not mean  in specie to dischaige the calls
that might be made upon them, in the proportion
of one d  llai in five, and generally that it would
be impossible foi them to do u, without making
calls upon  their debtors—which calls,  in these
embarrassed  times, were not much to be relied
upon, hence, he maintained it became propei on
the pait of Congress to examine into their condi
tion     He referred to the statement piesented of
the resouices of the Bank of the Metropolis, and
insisted that much of them which was held forth
as good, could not be considered so, when the
depiecmtion upon corporation property, &c , was
taken  into account     lie complained that in the
item of stocks, which was icpresented as one of
their resources, a large amount consisted of a num
ber of shares of their own stock, which the bank
had bought up at a discount    Thus, the Govern-
ment money was proved to be placed in a bank
whose stock was only worth seventy five per cent ,
and  the last account of their condition, showed
that in February, 1834, there was ^181,541 m this
way stated to be a part of their means, whilst, in
fact, it was for so much a substraction from their
means  to meet the public engagement     He de-
sued, however, to be distinctly understood, notas
saying that any bank in the District was insolvent,
but he would say from this, that no bank could be
m a more tottering condition than this     For, if
the stockholders and directors, with  the  public
money m their possession, went on buying up
their own stock, consuming their tangible means
where was the residue to come from > It was
in fact, an anticipation of payment to themselves,
even at a depiecmtion, which, however va'uable
might be their othir assets, it was lepiehensible
in them to make What security was there that,
having made these parchares, they wculd stop
there ' He went on to comment upon the rema Its
of the honorable member fiom New York, [Mi
B^ardsley,] and to defend the directors of the
bank from having, as chirged, failed by precon-
cert, or with the object of being well paid by the
United States Bank for so doing, &c He con-
sidered there could not have been a more flagitious
chaige upon them He did not know them, but
he would venture to say theu character would be
found to stand as high as that of any member in
the House, and that to make such a charge, was
hazarding a great deal He would have risen on
this sul ject, were it only to repel the attack which
was made on his colleague [Mr C Allan] for
havirg said, that with an impartial jury he wou'd
pi ove the insolvency of the deposite banks This
he, also, would engage to do, and would be will-
ing to take the honorable member from New York
himself—for that person whom the State of New *
Yoik had appointed to be one of her judges, he
would not olject to as a juror on such an Issue
¡Mr CHILTON rose for the purpose of s atmg
a fact, which he considered of some importance
on ti e consideraron of this resolution Objection
had been made by the member from New Yoik
[Mr Beardsli v] to its adoption, he believed, on
the ground that Congress had no power to investi-
gate into the affans of the Bank of the Metropolis
If this was so, he should like to know what powers
Congress had ovei the other banks, which did not
equally extend, by the charters, to it He called
on him to turn to the charter, and show how oi
where it was, that the power v as made contingent
only in certain events He contended that it would
appear, on examination of the charters granted by
Congress, that thepowers were not contingent, and
unless the mere factof the Bank of the Metropolis
having been selected as one of the favorite banks of
the Government, gave it such an exemption from
investigation into its affairs, Congress had the
powei to make it But this suiely would not be
contended      He would put this question for the
¡ honoiable membei to answer—whether the very
cucum«tance of being selected as a depository for
| the public money,did not furnish the Wrongest of
all possible aiguments that Congress shoulcfmake
the inquiry The country was more deeply inter-
ested in its stability than in that of the others, and
it was important for them to exam.ne whether,aa
was alleged of all the deposite banks, it was unable
to meet demands upon it  So much as to the power
i Heie he referred to the piovisions in the charter,
i (upon which he was about to comment,) contain-
ing an important fact, when he was obliged to
suspend, without concluding his remarks, in con-
sequence of the expiration of the hour allotted for
morning business
The joint resolution from the Senate, directing
the Commissioner of the Public Buildings to water
the Pennsylvania Avenue, was referred to the
Committee on the Distuct
Mr DUNCAN asked, an J obtained leave of the
House, to lay on the table, and have printed, " A
bill to modify and e-ctend an act to incorporate the
subscribers to the Bank of the United States, with
certain limitations and conditions," which bill, he
gave notice, he intended to offer as a substitute
for a bill reported fiom ti e Committee of Ways
and Means to regulate the deposites of the public
money m the State and local banks, when that
bill should be considered in the Committee of the
Whole
Mr POLK asked the unanimous consent of the
House, by which this day was set apart for the
consideration of bills, for the purpose of going into
committee on
THE APPROPRIATION BILL.
Mr J  a ADAMS objected
Mr POLK moved a suspension of the rule for
this purpose
Mr R M JOHNSON called for the yeas and
nays Thev were ordered, but he subsequently
withdrew the call and the motion prevailed—yeaa
