HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Cassville, Ga., May 22, 1864.

Brigadier-General BURBRIDGE,

Louisville, Ky:

Your dispatch about a Morgan raid is received. Give my compliments to the Governor, and tell him I expect him and you to take care of Kentucky while I help to dispose of Johnston. I want all the veterans here. Send me the Twelfth Ohio Cavalry and Eleventh Michigan Cavalry as soon as you can spare them.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

WHITE'S STATION, May 22, 1864-1 p. m.

Major-General WASHBURN,

Commanding District of WEST Tennessee:

I have just received the following from my 100 men, dated this morning, on the La Grange road near Fisherville. The information received is as follows: General Forrest, with a large force of cavalry and infantry and three batteries, was at Tupelo on the 20th. At Corinth is Neely's brigade; also a force at or near Holly Springs. They have a chain of couriers from Raleigh to Macon; thence to Corinth and Tupelo; also from Raleigh to La Grange, Holly Springs, &amp;c. General Forrest is concentrating and recruiting his forces for a move, but in what direction I am as yet unable to say. I shall now move toward Corinth and try to capture some of his telegraph cavalry. The country is full of their scouts. The force at Holly Springs must be the same which attacked my scout yesterday. A Fort Pillow negro has just come in; an intelligent man. He says the rebels are repairing the railroad from Tupelo to Jackson, Tenn., and that Forrest has about 15,000 men. I will send this man in by 5 p. m. train. You would do well to send an orderly to the depot for him. He says Major Bradford was with them in Mississippi.

G. E. WARING, Jr.,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST TENNESSEE,Memphis, May 22, 1864.

Colonel GEORGE E. WARING:

Send out 1,000 men to Holly Springs. Let them proceed with great care, keeping their flanks well scouted out, and be sure not to be entrapped. They will report back to you whenever they make any discoveries.

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major-General.

All but seventeen of the Fourth Missouri have come in, and more are expected. The attack was made by McDonald's battalion, who claim to have killed 8 of our men. The 1,000 men have gone.
