General CRAIG:

Price whipped Blunt yesterday evening; captured nearly all his artillery. Price has possession of Lexington and is crossing forces to this side of the river. I am falling back to Hamilton.

CHILLICOTHE, October 20, 1864.

General CRAIG:

All is quiet here this morning. Experiences of the past night evidence that my command at this post is in good fighting trim and eager to meet the enemy. My lines yesterday, last night, and this morning are as quiet and orderly as a camp of veterans. The information obtained since my last dispatch leads me to conclude that the rebel force that marched south from Carrollton had orders to recross the Missouri River. It was stated publicly by them at Carrollton that such were their orders. This only doubled my diligence, but I now think that orders were received by them at Carrollton to recross the river.

General CRAIG:

I have just received a dispatch from my scout to Turkey Creek, twenty-odd miles southwest of this. No force was found in that direction. The rebel scout in the vicinity of Dawn night before last had its orders from General Fagan. That scout was evidently trying to ascertain my strength.

General CRAIG:

I have just received a dispatch from Captain Woodruff at Hamilton. He says that he has received a dispatch from Major McDonald stating that Price whipped Blunt yesterday, capturing nearly all his artillery; that Price has possession of Lexington and is crossing forces to this side of the river, and that McDonald was falling back to Hamilton. Should be pleased to hear whether you have anything additional on that subject.
