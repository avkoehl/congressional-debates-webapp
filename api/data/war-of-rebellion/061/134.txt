viously expressed instructions from me, formed the battalion into column of four by the right, and charged the front of the enemy. Under a heavy fire the column moved to a position in front of the line formed by the enemy, and opened fire with considerable effect. Part of the men were still in the rear, and efforts were made to bring them up. At this juncture I reached the scene of action and assumed command. For the space of ten minutes, under a terrific fire from the enemy's works, this little band of about 25 men, forming my advance, stood their ground, keeping the enemy at bay, and at one time breaking the center of their front line of battle. This advantage I was unable to improve for want of a force with which to charge the enemy, the men still in the rear not coming up as promptly as I had expected and ordered.

In the mean time my flanks were turned, and in order to prevent my being entirely surrounded gave the order to retreat to a new position in a dense thicket on the opposite side of Martin's Creek. Overwhelmed by numbers, I was forced to abandon this position, and as rapidly as possible and the nature of the ground would permit I supposed, by this time, had reached the mill. In this I was prevented by the enemy, who appeared in force on the hill commanding the mill road. But one chance remained for me to escape from the overwhelming force with which I was contending, and that was to follow an old road, which led up the hills, and take possession of the ridge. I did so immediately, closely pursued by the enemy. Forming my men on the ridge I made a stand and opened fire. This held them in check, but I was again flanked and forced to retreat along the ridge to another point, which gave me a favorable position with which to retard their pursuit. In this manner, for nearly 8 miles, I kept up a running fight until the enemy ceased pursuing us, and gave my now exhausted men and horses a chance to recover their energies. Still retreating, I crossed the river at Walker's Ford, 12 miles west of the scene of action, unmolested by the enemy, and hearing nothing of Captain Majors, took up my line of march for Batesville, where I arrived without further loss.

For an account of the part taken by Captain Majors in this action I beg leave to respectfully refer to his report, but must state that but for the gallant charge made by him on the enemy, in their rear, and while I was fighting them on the hills, I must have inevitably been surrounded and my entire command captured.* By the truly gallant and efficient manner in which the task assigned him was performed, fearlessly charging a largely superior force of the enemy, who possessed every advantage of position, he demonstrated what thais already been shown, that "Courage and determination will overcome greatly superior numbers."

Captain Rouch, of the Eleventh Cavalry, who was, toward the last of the engagement, unfortunately taken prisoner by the enemy by reason of his horse being shot from under him, displayed great coolness, decision, and promptness in obeying all orders given by me. To Lieutenants Warrington and Harris great praise is due for the gallantry and determination displayed by them during the entire fight, always in the front, encouraging the men under their command, and by their personal efforts in retarding the pursuit and in
