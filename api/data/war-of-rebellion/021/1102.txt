being already claimed by persons who have taken the required oath of allegiance. In regard to horses, the are very scarce; most of those to be found scattered about the country are light, too light for draught and even for cavalry purposes. From necessity, most of those found in the districts we occupy are now in public service, so there are no more to be had.

The transportation peculia to the country has been, up to this, from necessity used at the stations and depots more or less permanent; but I consider it impracticable to from any reliable army transportation or get together any number of horses from the ruins found here.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. CHANDLER,

Lieutenant Col. and Asst. Quartermaster, Nineteenth Army Corps.
