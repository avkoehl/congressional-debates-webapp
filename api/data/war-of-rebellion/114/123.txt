Curtis requested me to act as commissioner and at my request detailed Lieutenant L. J. Barnes to render me any assistance I might require.

As the number to be exchanged of the Lexington prisoners was limited to a portion of the whole and all being on parole I decided to exchange only those who signified their intention to re-enlist for service. Much delay and labor ensued in getting the names from the recruiting officers scattered in various portions of the country. Were it not from such delay this report would have ben made much earlier. The Full number authorized has not yet been reached, but I cannot procure further lists of prisoners re-enlisted and therefore hand in my report.

We have exchanged--

The above gives the United States an excess in the exchange occasioned by the fact that only 489 officers and privates of the Camp Jackson prisoners were found desirous of joining their fortunes with secession and General Price. Yet I am informed unofficially through good authority that many of the prisoners at Camp Jackson are in the rebel army yet without exchanges, and a majority of those now in the army violated parole before exchanging. With the report you have memorandum marked A,* giving a complete list of exchanges on both sides with rank.

D. R. Barclay, the rebel commissioner, has attended principally to the exchanges and I hereby take occasion to mention the uniform courtesy and liberality toward me he has evinced in transacting the exchanges.

I am, colonel, respectfully, &amp;c.,

CHAS. H. HOWLAND,

Commissioner of Exchanges.

SAINT LOUIS ARSENAL, May 16, 1861.

Captain S. WILLIAMS,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Dept. of the West, Saint Louis, Mo.

SIR: In consequence of the frequent arrivals at this place of persons from Potosi complaining of revolting outrages and being driven from their homes because of their loyalty to the General Government I caused a party to proceed to that place to apprehend offending parties and give consolation and relief to the sufferers. The object seems to have been very judiciously accomplished by Captain Cole, of the Fifth
