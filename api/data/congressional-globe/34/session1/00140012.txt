SENATE CLERICS.
_ Mr. PRATT. I have a resolution which I de-
sire to offer; and as it has reference only to the
organization of the body, I hope" the Senate will
agree to pass it now:
TUllam H,ck|,y b<>- hereby, an-
pom.ed chief Clerk at a salary of $2,500; and that J. II.
Xrom?m"m.aPPOmted *" 1110 P'aCe made VaCa,lt by hls
This resolution, as you will observe,-sir, makes
no change in the present force of the Senate.
•The gentlemen at the desk will continue to hold
their present positions, but it affords the oppor-
tunity to appoint an additional officer, without
taking from the salary of eitherof those gentlemen
who are now with us, to read so that Senators
may be able to hear throughout the Senate Cham-
ber.
The resolution was considered by unanimous
consent and agreed to.
PAPERS WITHDRAWN. *
On motion of Mr. SEWARD, it was
Ordered, That the petition ami papers of William IJrown
tl1VT,,M >laW"/r0mthe ffl0s of t,le Scnate an<1 delivered to

On motion of Mr. SLIDELL, it was
Ordered, That the petition and papers of the late General
December 8,
Robert Armstrong, on the files of the Senate, be taken there-
from and referred to the Court of Claims.
NOTICE OF .BILLS.
Mr. SLIDELL gave notice of his intention to
ask leave to introduce the following bills:
■ A bill to remove obstructions in the mouths of
the river Mississippi at the South West Pass and
Pass a 1 Outre; and
A bill relating to pilotage.
THE NA.VAL RETIRING BOARD.
Mr. SUMNER. I have a memorial of Joseph
Smith, late a citizen of Massachusetts, and cap-
tain in the Navy of the United States, in which
he sets forth that he entered the naval service as
long ago as 1809; that he served fai thfully tbrough-
out the war of 1812, from its beginning to its
close; that he lias been in service in various posi-
tions ever since; that he has commanded a squad-
ron in the Mediterranean, and has been at the
head of one of the bureaus of the Navy Depart-
ment at Washington; that, notwithstanding these
services, by the recent action of the board, con-
stituted under the act of the last Congress, he
finds himself on the retired list; Snd he now
appeals to Congress to repair that injustice. As
the committees have not yet been appointed, I
ask that the memorial be received, and that it lie
on the table. The petitioner has requested me
still further to ask that his memorial be printed
for the use of the Senate. That motion I shall
make after the memorial has been received.
■The PRESIDENT. That motion should go
to the Committee on Printing, under the rules.
Mr. SUMNER. I would suggest to the Chair
that, as the committees have not yet been ap
pointed, the motion may be entertained by the
Senate at this moment.
The PRESIDENT. Does the Senator ask
that the memorial shall lie on the table ?
Mr. SUMNER. I propose that it shall lie on
the table; and,if agr&ableto the Senate, I should'
like to have it printed.
Mr. TOUCEY. I object to any order for
printing.
The PRESIDENT. The memorial will lie on
the table. The motion to print it must, under
the rules, go to the Committee on Printing whati
it shall be organized.
Mr. WELLER. I presume no one expects
that the House of Representatives will organize
to-day, judging from the indications of yester-
day; 1 therefore move that the Senate do now
adjourn.
The motion was agreed to, and the Senate
adjourned.
