All right. General McDowell remains. We come back immediately.

S. P. CHASE.

Memorandum on above telegram.

The President wants to know what the plan is in sending the brigade up to Alexandria. Is it a part of the movement?

FALMOUTH, May 25, 1862.

(Received 11.20 a. m.)

E. M. STANTON:

Brigade sent to Alexandria to expedite movement and as part of it. President's whole order is being executed as rapidly as possible. Ord's division follows that of Shields' instead of King's.

S. P. CHASE.

FALMOUTH, May 25, 1862.

(Received 12.10 p. m.)

To the PRESIDENT:

Since my dispatch in cipher information from the War Department that Jackson and Johnson are probably co-operating with Ewell unites all opinions here upon the movement indicated by you in preference to the other lines mentioned in that dispatch. General McDowell appreciates, as you do, the importance of the service he is called on to perform. All possible exertion is being made by him and the officers under him to expedite the movement. He will remain here till the troops are all off, and then observe any further directions given by you. Having done all I can here, I shall come immediately to Washington with General Shields, and hope to arrive by six this afternoon.

S. P. CHASE.

P. S.-All Shields' division is off but one battery and Ord's follows immediately.

S. P. CHASE.
