THE' COXGEESSIOJNTAL GLOBE.
May 4,
ducer the last penny it can carry away, and
lavishes unestimated millions m disseminating
through official patronage all forms of cor-
ruption necessary to perpetuate its power more
to exact. This is a way-side illustration of
receipts and expenditures keeping pace with
increase in wealth and population. It involves
an appalling departure from our original
standard, and leads directly to an Asiatic and
despicable venality, instability, and effeminacy.
It cannot be disguised. The great receipts
and expenditures of the party in power are
great crimes; and upon those crimes it sub-
sists. Reduce its revenue to the revenue stand-
ard of the fiscal year ending with the month
of June, 1800, and its fattest kine would break
from the close.
Our population in 1800 was 31,183,744; in
1870 it had increased to 38,115,041; an in-
crease of twenty-two per cent. In cor.trast
with this, what has been the increase in our
Federal expenditures during that, period of
ten years? In 1801 our expenditures, on ac-
countoftlie civil list alone, were §5,074,041 83.
In 1871 the ascertained expenditures of the
present Administration on account of the civil
list alone amounted to the enormous sum
of §18,760,779 40 ; an increase in ten years
of over two hundred and nine per cent. ; an
iuciease of §12,080.737 63 over and above the
expenditures on account of the civil list during
the last year of Mr. Buch.mau's administra-
tion, and an excess of §1,770,195 over and
above the total expenditures of the last year
of the administration of Mr. Jefferson.
In 1801 our expenditures on account of for-
eign intercourse amounted to §1,117,780 ill.
In 1871 the ascertained expenditures of tlie
present Administration on account of foreign
intercourse alone had risen to the sum of
$1,004,373 87; an increase in ten years of
over thirty-nuic per cent., and an increase of
$450,580 90 over and above the expenditures
on account of foreign intercourse during the
last year of Mr. Buchanan's administration.
Under the head of miscellaneous expenses
the expenditures of the Government m 1801
amounted to §10.020,524 79. In 1871, under
that head, the present Administration had
carried its ascertained expenditures to the
enormous sum of §40,116,702 90; an increase
in ten years of over one huudred and fifty per
cent.; an increase of §24,090,238 over and
above the expenditures for miscellaneous ex-
penses during the last year of Mr. Buchanan's
administration ; an excess of $3,308,319 over
and above the total expenditures of the Gov-
ernment during the three first years of the
first administration of Mr. Jefferson, and ail
excess ol $12,484,480 over and above the total
expenditures of the Government during the
first year of the administration of Mr. Polk.
For military services the expenditures of
the Government in 1800 were $10,472,202 72.
For the year 1870 the ascertained expendi-
tures of the present Administration for mil-
itary services aione reached the frightful
extravagance of $57,055,075 40; an increase
in ten years of over two hundred and fifty per
cent., an increase of $41,183,472 08 over
and above the expenditures for military services
during the last year of Mr. Buchanan's ad-
ministration; an excess of $8,222,593 74
over and above the total expenditures of "the
Government for the first full term of four
years of the administration of Mr. Jefferson;
an excess of $30,023,392 50 over and above
the total expenditures of the Government
during the first year of the administration of
Mr. Polk, and only $7,109,325 less than the
total expenditures of the empire of Great
Britain in 1871 for her military service, with
, a royal army of 135,037 men of all ranks.
In 1860 our expenditures on account of the
naval establishment amounted to $11,514,649
83. In 1870 the ascertained expenditures of
the present Administration on account of the
naval establishment, alone had been swelled
to the sum of $21,780,229 87; an increase in
ten years of eighty-nine percent.; an increase
of $10,205,580 04 over and above the expend-
itures on account of the naval establishment
of the last year of the administration of Mr.
Buchanan ; an excess of $5,015,645 07 over
and above the total expenditures of the Gov-
ernment during the last year of the adminis-
tration of Mr. Jefferson; and §12,381,753 85
over and above the expenditures of the admin-
istration of Mr. Polk in 1848-49 on account
of the naval establishment, pending the war
with Mexico.
On account of our relations with the Indian
tribes our expenditures in 1861 were $2,865,-
481 17. In 1871 the ascertained expenditures
of the present Administration on account of
the Indian tribes reached the enormous total
of §7,420,997 44 ; an increase in ten years
of one huudred and fifty-nine per cent. ; an
increase of $4,501,510 27 over and above the
expenditures on account of the Indian tribes
during the last year of Mr. Buchanan's admin-
istration ; and an excess of $219,458 42 over
and above the total expenditures of the Gov-
ernment during the first year of the first
administration of General Washington.
The honorable charity of pensions to the
heroic defender of his country, disabled in her
service, or to his widow and orphan children,
is enjoined by the emotions of every heart, and
commanded by the plainest dictates of public
policy, lishberaland faithful practice hasillus-
trated the humanity and the civilization of the
people of rliis Government from Washington
down to Grant. In dispensing that portion of the
private anil public treasure of the people dedi-
cated to the utilization of the public gratitude
for the material aid of the public delender, it
must necessarily be impracticable for Govern-
ment, in all cases, to discriminate between the
rightful recipient of its succor and the shame-
less pretender who counterfeits him. Errors
and abuses must creep in. Infirmities inhere
in every system and impair every practice.
The noble policy and practice of pensions for
military and naval services are not only ob-
noxious but peculiarly susceptible to abuse.
But tliev must not be discredited nor their
proper diffusion be so hesitating, difficult, and
suspicious as to result in cutting off relief to
the worthy in order to detect and expose im-
posture. The construction and administration
of the pension system is therefore a great trust
and a grave responsibility in government. It
is .a trust at once popular and dangerous;
pleasing to the sense of the people, whose
emotions are quickened by the contemplation
of generosity, and a temptation to the integrity
of the Administration, whose lust of poweris
gratified by the secret prostitution of a sacred
fund.
Under llie noble name of pensions an almost
fabulous treasure is annually abstracted from
the earnings ot the industry and production of
the people. In the third year of the second
administration of General Jackson pensions
reached" their greatest total in the sum of
$3,304,285 30. From that time to 1801, with
the exception of occasional fluctuations, they
steadily declined, until in 1802 they had fallen
to a minimum of $852,170 47. From that
epoch the expenditures of the party in power
in the name of pensions have increased, and
are still increasing. In 1871 they had been
swelled to the scarcely credible sum of $34,-
443,894 88. If that money reaches the wants
of the soldier, sailor, or marine, his widow or
orphan, it is a munificent benefaction, well
deserved and worthily bestowed. If a large
proportion of it falls by the way into venal
hands of enterprising faction, and is employed
in subsidizing partisans and carrying elections,
there is scarcely any other current evil more
oppressive to the people and disgraceful to
the Government.
Prior to 1802 the State and Federal Govern-
ments had been burdened with ten successive
wars ; and yet at that time our expenditures
on account of pensions were only $852,170 47.
In 1871 the ascertained expenditures of the
present Administration on account of pensions
alone had been carried to the sum of $34,443,-
894 88—an increase in nine years of nine
hundred and twenty-three per cent; an in-
crease of §33,591,721 41 over and above the
expenditures on account of pensions of the
second year of the first administration of Mr.
Lincoln; an excess of $6,380,914 72 over
and above the total expenditures of the Gov-
ernment throuahout the last three years of the
last administration of Mr. Jefferson ; and an
excess of $0,811,011 98 over and above the
total expenditures of the Government during
the first year of the administration of Mr. Polk.
Thus it appears that while our population
from 1800 to 1870 has increased but twenty-
two per cent., and the main fabric of our Gov-
ernment has theorelically remained 'substan-
tially in statu quo, public expenditures display
the following unexampled increase :

An _ increase of expenditure is showu in
those items alone of near one hundred and
twenty per cent., contrasting an increase in
population of but twenty-two per cent., with
an increase of taxation burdens upon pop-
ulation of near one hundred and twenty per
cent., as one of the exemplifications of the
public economy of radical statesmanship. On
the basis of the census of 1860 it has been es-
timated that the gross value of the annual pro-
duct of the people amounted to a fraction over
three billions. In ten years, say, in round num-
bers, thirty billions. Of that total it appears
bv the ascertained receipts of the Administra-
tion party that they have taken from the peo-
ple in actual cash, two thirds by taxation, the
residue by loans, from 1801 to 1871, the ap-
palling sum of $10,803,307,811 02, or during
the last preceding ten years the equivalent
of thirty three and one third per cent., or
full one third part of the gross estimated value
of the entire annual product of the people, on
the basis of the census of 1860; and during
the last preceeding six years from 1865 to 1871
the sum of $6,132,880,296. And of that total
of treasure they have expended from 1861 to
1871, $10,155,028,917 86; and from 1865 to
1871, the sum of $5,587,610,202 30; leaving
the people still burdened on the 1st day of
July, 1871, with a monstrous ascertained gold
debtof §2,353,211,332 32, incumbered with an
annual gold bearing interest of not less than
$125,000,000. The enigma of what additional
uncounted millions have been furtively realized
