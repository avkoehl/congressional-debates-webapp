demand as a right an investigation. As public accuser you must make your charges good. You will, therefore, at once furnish me with the proof on which your statements are grounded.

Your obedient servant,

Major-General.

LA GRANGE, November 25, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT,

Memphis:

I was about to send some cavalry from here down toward Salem, but find they have orders to march to-morrow; I don't know where to. All the cavalry about here have the same orders.

It will be impossible for me to operate successfully against mounted men with infantry alone unless I am attacked, in which case I will do the best I can.

It seems to me the cavalry that was to go to Somerwille could be used to much better advantage here.

J. M. TUTTLE,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tennessee, November 25, 1863.

Brigadier-General TUTTLE,

La Grange, Tennessee:

The movement of cavalry to the front will cover the link toward Okolona and ascertain the rebel strength. The movement on Somerville is necessary to break up the recruiting rendezvous north of the road. At Somerville both infantry and cavalry will be within your reach if menaced. One battalion of cavalry is reserved for La Grange.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tennessee, November 25, 1863.

Brigadier-General TUTTLE,

La Grange, Tennessee:

I expect Forrest to unite his force about Salem or below, and strike for the railroad between La Grange and Pocahontas. Every care must be taken to guard against a surprise and to move upon him in force. He will be about 6,000 strong and is moving for West Tennessee. I move out two regiments of infantry and battery and three regiments of cavalry to Somerville, so as to be ready to strike him in flank if he crosses the road. Communicate freely with Stevenson at Corinth.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
