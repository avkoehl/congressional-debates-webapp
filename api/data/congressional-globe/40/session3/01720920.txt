BUSINESS AT EVENING SESSIONS. , '
Mr. SCIIENCK. . I desire to say that the
Committee of Ways, and Means-haw been
engaged in a, rovisio'n tlio general .amend-
ments offered in.Committec of the Wiolo to the
internal revenue l^Ul; embracing .those, with
relation to tho tax on whisliv and tobacco ; but
for want of the printed bilf,'with the amend-
ments made thus lar, wo cannot be prepared to
proceed advantageously with the consideration
of t.be bill in Committee of the Whole to-night;
and if it bo not considered to-night I suppose
it had bettor be laid, over,till Monday night, as
but few members are lively to attend on Sat-
urday evening. I therefore .{i-ak unanimous
consent that the session of.to-highfbe devoted
to general debate in' Committee of the Whole.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will state that
five speeches were made last evening, and he
is not aware that any other gentlemen will be
ready to speak to-night, although it is possible
that some may be.
Mr. BR00MALL. I understand there are
several, gentlemen who will be ready to go 011
to-night.
Mr. SCHENCK. I ask, then, unanimous
consent that the consideratio 11 of the tax bill
he not resumedin Committee of the Whole till
next Monday night; that the meeting of the
House to-morrow evening be dispensed with ;
and that this evening be devoted to general
debate in Committee of the Whole.
The SPEAKER. If .there be no objection,
it will be so ordered. - ' '
There was no objection.
AKMY APPKOMtWriON BILI,'. '.
Mr. BLAINE. I. move that the, rules be
suspended, and that the House resplvo itself
into Committee of the Whole -on the state of
the Union, to proceed, to the consideration:of -
the hill (0. R. No- 1803) -making appropria-
tion.s for the s,apport 'of the-Artny for-the year
ending J;iiij>e:3(), 1870.;: • . - . : —• ' «
The motion was agreed to. . - ■
The :>House.-"accordingly resblted: itself into
the .Committee o£ the. Whole on the state of-
the Union, (Mr. Perry; in the chair,) .and
receded-to the consideration of th^.bill (H.
No.' 1808) making appropriations for the"
support'of-'the Army for the year ending June
8.0, 1870. - ... "--
Mr. BLAINE. I movethat thefirst reading
of the hill-be dispensed with.
The CHAIRMAN. That will require unani-
mous Qpnsent. Is there any objection?
There was no objection ; and the first read-
ing of the bill was dispensed with.
FINANCE AND CURRENCY. -
Mr. HOOPER, of Massachusetts. Mr.
Speaker; a'Representative of the people who
has.sincerely at heart the prosperity and finan-
cial credit of the nation can consider at this
time no question of more vital importance than
the condition'of the- public- debt'and of the
currency of the country. I make no apology,
therefo're^.for occupying the time of the House
and asking their .attention to the views in re-
gard to th^sfi questions which I have reached
after'jfatieiit'arjd careful consideration.
During the first term of President Lincoln's
administration' the demands, for money' to
maintain the forces so' suddenly raised tif'put
down the rebellion; an'd to carry on the pro-
tracted war which ensued, wore necessarily vast
in amount, and, so long as the war continued,
too imperative to await the slow processes of
ordinary financial negotiations. Money was
sought 5'or and obtained at almost any rate at
which it could be had, and in the forms best
suited to the choice of lenders. The public
dSbt, therefore, was represented in a great,
variety of forms, at different rates of interest,
and much of it payable within comparatively
short-'periods;-,' -• • •
Among the'different' forms''of public' debt
were "certificates gf, indebtedness, payable
.within "di>e year from their,date ; "temporary
loans,-' payable at.ten days', notice; "eom-
powid-iRterest notes," principal And..interest
payable at maturity; and * seven-thirty Treas-
ury, notes," convertible at .'the'holder's1 option,
into: -fife-twenty bonds'' or payable in three
years-from'daste-. These had been issued at
various periods, so thata large amount became
due soou after hostilities ceased. And; in addi-
tion, there "were overdue and unsatisfied requi-
sitions on the' Treasury, whibh; at onetime,
amounted' to more than-one hundred million
dollars.' >
Ample provision was * made ; in the laws
authorizing this temporary debt for funding it
as'it became due,/ To-those who have'not
closely watched the operations of the Treasury
it may perhaps be matter of some surprise to
learn that, siilce the commencement of Pres-
ident Lincoln's second t$rm of office,,'all that,
portion of the public debt consisting of so
many different forms due Within compara-
tively short periods, has now been funded in
pursuance of -those laws; and that the Treas-
ury cannot be called upon for many years to
provide for any amount beyond the interest,
unless it may be for a portion of the three per
cent, certificates, which were isstted to the
banks'in exchange for compound-interest notes.
The following: statement exhibits the con-
dition of the_ public debt at the beginning of
the last and of the present fiscal'years, and its
condition 6n the 1st of January, 1869 ; the first
two tAken from the annual report to Congress
of the Secretary of tho Treasury, and the last
from the monthly Statement published.by the
Treasury Department- , By comparing the

The subsidy bonds granted to the Pacific
railroad companies, payable thirty years from
date, should not he included as a part,of the
public debt to he provided for by the Govern-
ment, as those companies are believed to be
abundantly able to meet the interest on the
bonds as it accrues, as well as the principal
when they mature. There i3 sufficient money
in the Treasury to meet the matured debt on
which interest ceased when it became due ; the
