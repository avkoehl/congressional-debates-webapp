badly scattered, dismounted detachments of my cavalry being stationed at various points within and without the department. I earnestly beg the assistance of the commanding general in collecting my troops together, that I may be able to make them efficient and well disciplined.

I am thankful to the officers and men for the gallantry and fortitude displayed under all circumstances. I would especially mention Colonel William B. Tibbits, Twenty-first New York Cavalry, commanding the First Brigade, already alluded to in this report, as a gallant and meritorious officer, and one in every way deserving promotion.

The following members of my staff were present with me, and discharged their duties in a highly commendable manner: Captain E. W. Clark, jr., assistant adjutant-general; Captain Robert E. Hedden, division commissary subsistence; Lieutenant Benjamin J. Ricker, jr., aide-de-camp; Lieutenant W. B. Laishe, aide-de-camp; Captain C. W. Boyd, division ordnance officer; Captain S. J. Steves, division provost marshal; Surg. Frederick Elliott, acting medical director.

A part of the above-named officers were sent with the train, and succeeded in checking the disgraceful stampede which was occasioned by Colonel Higgins.

Captain McCue, Twenty-first New York Cavalry, is deserving of mention for gallantly in the charge which that regiment made at Ashby's Gap. Such officers as have failed to perform their duties properly, or have shown cowardice in action, have already been recommended by me for dismissal.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. N. DUFFIE,

Brigadier-General.
