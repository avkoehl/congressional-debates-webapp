them. The rebels are mounted on the fastest horses in the country, and they use them very much to our disadvantage. If all of my regiment were here and mounted, I would soon disperse the rebels. I again urge the necessity of mounting my entire regiment and ordering it to the field.

I respectfully ask that this communication be forwarded to department headquarters for the information of the general commanding.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully,

W. B. STOKES,

Colonel Fifth Tennessee Cavalry, Commanding.

Assistant Adjutant-General, District of Nashville.

FEBRUARY 22, 1864.-Raid on Mayfield, Ky.

Report of Colonel Stephen G. Hicks, Fortieth Illinois Infantry.

PADUCAH, KY., February 29, 1864.

On the 22nd instant I received news from Mayfield, Ky., that the place was threatened by a hand of guerrillas. I ordered Lieutenant Cunningham, commanding colored troops, to start at daylight with 200 of his men to go as fast as he could to Mayfield, and stay there until further orders.

He left here on the morning of the 23rd, went within 15 miles of that place, and encamped at 3 a.m. The guerrillas entered Mayfield, killed J. B. Happy, a good Union man, took Parson Dugger prisoner, put him in heavy bonds, robbed three stores [all belonging to Union men], took all the goods they wanted, and destroyed the rest, and then left.

Lieutenant Cunningham arrived there early on the 24th, and will remain there until further orders.

S. G. HICKS,

Colonel, Commanding Post.
