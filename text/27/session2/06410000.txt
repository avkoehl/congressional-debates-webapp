Continued from JVb 39
the number of officers in commission in the naval
service, to what it was on the l¡>t of January,
1841 Well, now, (continued Mr Evans,) as the
Senate decidsd that this enlargement was neces-
sary, the committee took this as good evidence
that it was necessary, and that it would be exceed-
ingly improper to undo what they had, in the exer-
cise of their deliberate judgment, tnus done
If it were proper for him to speak in ieims of
condemnation ot a proposition emanating from the
House, he would show he exceeding impropriety,
inexpediency, and impolicy of this provision in
itself. Why, what was it? It assumed to fix the
number of officers of the navy m the various
grades, which number shouu not hereafter be in-
creased. It was altering a long-established and
existing law relating to the naval service, by which
the number of officers in commission, and seamen,
is left to the control of the conimander-m-chier. It
proposed to change a long-existing state of the law
in reference to the regulation of the naval service,
and, as he conceived, without any apparent or ade-
quate necessity for doing so. He thought that,
instead of being called upon by the gentlemen on
the other side to show wny this provision should be
stricken out, the gentlemen themselves should be
compelled 10 show why t jere had been inserted a
provision so variant from all that had heretofore
existed. Some reason, some satisfactory reason,
ought to be assigned. Et was a change in the naval
service, the ill consequences of which were greatly
to be apprehended What would be its effect,
especially upon the junior officers of the service? It
would effectually and absolutely stop all promotion,
at least during the lives of the present officers It
was a maiter of doubt whether there was one *o
young that he would live to see the time when the
opportunity for promotion would be afforded him
By operation of this provision, before another cap-
tain could be appointed, thirteen must be got rid of.
Forty-one commanders must be disposed of, before
there could be an appointment to the rank of com-
mander. Why, it would take some forty years.
And as to the lieuten ¿nts, many of them had been
in that rank in the service lor twenty five or thirty
years, and they would be compelled to remain
lieutenants for twenty five or thirty years longer,
provided they lived =¡o long, before they would have
a cnance of promotion Tr>e effect of such a bill
upon the naval service must be disastrous in the
extreme.
These were the reasons which had induced the
committee to com<" to the conclusion to which they
had come—that this proviso ought to be stricken
out. The committee believed that that which had
so long existed, might safely and properly be pre-
served; that it was more proper to conform to the
established law and to existing usages, than to
adopt this novel method of attempting, in an ap-
propriation bill, to legislate upon so important,
delicate, and difficult a subject as that oí regulat-
ing the naval branch of the service of this country,
by what, in his opiaion, was a most crude and
undigested legislation, suddenly brought up, as it
was, m an appropriation bill These were the
general principles on which the eommutee had
recommended that this proviso be stricken out,
and he thought, as he had before remarked, that it
was incumbent upon gentlemen on the other side
to show why it had been msened
Mr. WILLIAMS reniaikfd that his colleague
bad not yet satisfied him that tb*re was any suf
ficient reason for strikirg out this proviso The
increase of naval officers had already been greatly
beyond the increase of the navy itself For the
purpose of showing this, he would read a table
which he had drawn uo, of the increase of both
since 1820 The following was the table he read

The number of captains has more than doubled
from 1820 to 1841, and the number of command-
ers has more than quadrupled

So that it appears,  with the same
number of
navy-yards, naval stations, and vesseh, as sow,
the service in 1820 required only half the number
of captains, a quarter the number of commanders,
and a proportionately less number of lieutenants,
midshipmen, &c. The increase was so rapid last
year, that if the same rate was to be encouraged
this year, it would happen that men promoted but
a year ago from lieutenants to commanders, would
have to be made raptains, without having served
two years as commanders, and so with regard to
other ranks
It would b  found that there are 16 captains
commanding vessels at sea, 18 employed on shore—
making 34. There are 3 on leave, .snd 1 sus-
pended. So that, out of 68 now m commission,
there is employment for only 34 With respect to
commanders, the rase is still more striking Till
January, 1841, they never exceeded 55, but since
that, they have been increased to 96 Of these, 22
were on duty at home, and 22 on duty at sea. It
appears that there are some new duties now as-
signed to commanders he stated them—sach as
the charge of rendezvous stations, &c. But how
far there was any necessity f jr these establishments,
was a ques'ion of consideration for the Senate.
He contended that, if all the officers were effi-
cient officers, the same number in commission on
the 1st of January, 1841, would be quite enough
for the naval service. Tnat number was—of cap-
tains 55, cominardtrs 55, and lieutenants 288 In
the grade of captains, the service ought to have
efficient officers, and if any were in commission
not efficient, the 9 ought to be put on furlough, so
that all m commssion, for actual service, would
be efficient. In that case, the old number (55)
would bf> quite enough for the service, but he was
ready to almit thst, according to the present sys-
tem, the number woul I not be sufficient But,
including the Navy Commissioners, 18captamsare
now employed on shore. It wa* all r'ghr and
pioper that the officer- should have occasional
respite and recreation, but the moment that bound
is passed, the service is injured by suffering the
officers to remain so long on shore, for when an
officer is employed three years on short', it is a
proof that he is no longer wanted at sea.
If from three to six months were allowed oa re-
turn from foreign stations, it would be foüáiri qjpte
sufficient, ai>d not inconsistent with practical effi-
ciency. There can be no necessity for such a nfttn-
ber of officers as to admit of half being at sea, and
the other half on land. Such was not the case
heretofore. It was in 1835 that such increase of
shore pay was raade, as caused it to be ihe interest
of the officers to oe off duty. The only cure for
this evil was, either to -educe the pay when off duty,
or to limit the time of relaxation, and to'adjust the
number to the act'ial requirements of the service.
He was satisfied lhat the rumber of officers in,
comm ssion on the 1st of January, 1841, was am-
ple; and theiefore he was opposed to ¡striking out
the proviso now under discussion.
That there could be any necessity for such a vast
increase over the requ.remehts of the service for
1820, appeared to him to be impossible.
The increased cost of officers between the num-
ber in commission on the 1st of January, 1841,
and th* number proposed by the Navy Depart-
ment, would be upwards of $350,000 What in-
crease had laken place in the naval force to justify
this? In reality, the increase of force since 1820
had been very little Unless it were shown that
there was an irereased amount of duty equivalent
to this increase of officers and expense, he could
not be expected to vote for striking out the proviso
in this bill.
The number of midshipmen m 1840 was but
232, but now there are 450, and 103 passed mid-
shipmen. And if the number of lieutenants and
commanders be kept at 556, as in 1842, the chance
of promotion, from midshipman to captain, be-
comes so reduced, that it must speak^ very unfa-
vorably of a service, the efficiency of which, it is
allowed, depends so much on the stimulus of pro-
motion Some limitation ought to be put to the
power vested in ihe hands of the Executive and
the Navy Department, in the appointment of the
lower grades of officer', as the number now may
be indefinite Tne proviso in the bill was some
check or limitation; without it, there was none.
Mr. BAYARD considered this a matter of such
magnitude, and embracing such various considera-
tions, that he hardly knew where to begin. He
could not even expect to advert to all the topics
sueges ed by the Senator from Maine, without ex-
hausting the patience of the Senate. It was justly
said by the chairman of the Finance Committee,
[Mr. Evíns,] that it was a mo*t irregular mode of
proceeding, to introduce organic legislation m a
mere appropriation bill. It is manifest the object
of this proviso was not so much to reduce the offi-
cers and expense of the naval service, as to strike
a blow at tne appoint.ng power. It bore obviously
on 11s face an attempt to forestall the action of the
Senate, and prevent nominations without any re-
gard to the wants of the service. If for no other
reason, it ought to be resisted by the Senate, m
vindication of its own rights.
He should allude briefly to the increase of the
naval service In the infancy of this Government,
the navy, cut down and crushed as it was, gamed
some laurels It literally fought its way into the
favor of the American people; and there is not now
any difference of opinion as to the paramount im-
portance of that branch of the public service.
In the year 1816, one million of dollars annually
was voted for the increase of the navy for eight
years That was the basis of the present navy.
In March, 1821, it was found lhat this appropria-
tion was larger than the progress of the object re-
quired was practicable, for a navy cannot be built
up in eight years. I he appropriation for the next
six years was reduced to the rate of $500,000.
On the 31 March, 1827, the same appropriation
was made for another six years; and it was then
decided that the public lands, on which live-oak
was growing, should be reserved, and that other
provisions should be made for the future service.
In 1833, an appropriation of similar amount was
