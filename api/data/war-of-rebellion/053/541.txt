MORTON, August 24, 1863.

General BRAGG,

Chattanooga:

I sent 9.000 infantry and artillery. This road works so wretchedly that it will take five days, including yesterday, to get them off. This is a loan to be promptly returned.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH DISTRICT,DEPARTMENT OF MISSISSIPPI AND EAST LOUISIANA,

Grenada, August 24, 1863.

Major General S. D. LEE,

Commanding Cavalry in Mississippi:

GENERAL: Having learned that there is a possibility that I will be sent below with my present command, and Brigadier-General Jackson ordered here with his division of cavalry, I respectfully ask that this change may not be made, unless it is thought that I have proved myself unworthy of being continued longer in the command of this district.

I beg leave to call your attention to the fact that I gave up a fine brigade of infantry in General Bragg's army to take this command at the urgent solicitation of General Pemberton and Governor Pettus, who were pleased to think that my services would be valuable
