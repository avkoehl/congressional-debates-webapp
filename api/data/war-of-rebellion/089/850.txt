Major-General MEADE, Commanding Army of the Potomac:

In preliminary compliance with your directions by telegraph this morning, I have to report that I have proposed to leave 4,600 men in the lines, apportioned as follows: General Wheaton's division, from Battery 24 to Fort Wadsworth, inclusive 1,400 men; General Seymour's division from Fort Wadsworth to slashing beyond Fort Keene, 750 men; Major-General Gibbon's division, from left of Wheaton to right of Fort Fisher, 900 men; Major-General Miles' division from Fort Fisher to Fort Cummings, both inclusive, 1,550 men; total (six miles of line), 4,600 men. Perhaps this might be reduced a few hundred men. The force available for movement will then be Major-General Miles' division (First), 5,000 men, leaving the Third or Fourth Brigade in the intrenchments; Major-General Gibbon's division (Second), 2,500 men, leaving probably the Second Brigade in the intrenchments; Picket of Third Division, 800 men; Brigadier-General Seymour's division, 3,000 men (organizations not reported yet; strength of division given as 3,800); Brigadier-General Wheaton's division, 2,000 men (organizations and strength not yet reported; strength of division stated to be about 3,500); total available for movement, 13,300 men; left in intrenchments 4,600 men; total in intrenchments and in reserve, say 18,000 men. The batteries in the rear works available for movement with the troops are: Second Corps, Eleventh New York, 6 guns (3-inch rifled); Second Corps, Twelfth New York, 4 guns (light 12-pounders); Second Corps, First Rhode Island, 6 guns (light 12-pounders); Sixth Corps, First New Jersey (section of), 2 guns (light 12-pounders); Fifth Corps, First New York, 4 guns (3-inch rifles); total, 22; of which 12 are light 12-pounders and 10 are 3-inch rifles. I inclose copy of instructions issued respecting which I desire instructions, if not in accordance with your intentions. Will send report in detail of garrisons, commanders, &amp;c. It is intended to leave the intrenchments held by Sixth Corps in command of ranking officer of that corps and the same of Second Corps.
