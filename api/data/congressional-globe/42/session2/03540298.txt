APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

ligence guides the machinery, and the product
stands lirst in all markets. The village is
famous for manly sports, for music, and for
lectures, but contains no saloons. Its churches
are numerous and well attended. Savings
■banks have for depositors many of the men
and women. Some of the operatives I know,
Mr. Chairman, could give you a check for a
quarter's salary or discount your note for a
thousand dollais.
That is the flower of American industry.
Import men and set them at work. Bring a
hundred men hiiher to establish a new manu-
facture or extend an old one, and you add at
least $500,000 to our production. The value
of land is increased. A hundred families
become consumers of food and clothing and
household comforts. That builds up a home
market.
In many places we have seen the opposite
process. A great fire comes and sweeps away
a busy factory. Sir, I have seen such a result.
The burning of the Utica Globe mills brought
the lesson very near my home. The factory
was one day busy with cheerful and remunerated
labor. Before midnight the walls were ruins,
the machinery rubbish, and the operatives were
thrown out of work. They suffered inconven-
ience, and some the pinching of keenest poverty.
The stockholders lost money. The entire com-
munity felt the misfortune. Landlords found
their houses unoccupied. Grocers and mer-
chants, shoemakers and clothiers, lost custom-
ers. The city appreciated that for a time a
rich source of its prosperity was dried up. This
was accidental, and it was temporary. Would
you have legislation work worse and more
enduring mischief than the devouring flames?
WAGES.
But figures are more eloquent than general
statements. My own district does not differ
from other localities in which industry is diver-
sified. It does not wish sudden, reckless dis-
turbance of labor or of capital. - The national
currency has greatly appreciated since the war,
and its purchasing power has increased. Yet
wages have increased very considerably meas-
ured in currency. As a fair sample of the
advance, I give accurate reports from leading
establishments:

The agent of the Globe mill states that one
half of the operatives in the mill saved a part
of their earnings regularly, and about one third
were the owners of the houses in which they
resided.
The wages paid by the Utica steam knitting-
mills compare as follows:
, ... 1863. 1872.
fcarls for knitting
and sewing-ma-

COTTON.
The figures of the New York mills corrob-
orate the more elaborate table of the
UTICA STEAM COTTON-MII.I.S.
The following is a comparative statement of
wages paid operating mechanics and laborers
for manufacturing cotton goods in the years
1860,1865, and 1872:

duties, requiring a higher grade of skill and ability.

Cost of labor per pound of cloth, 1865 11 cents.
Cost of labor per pound of cloth, 1872.  8.9 cents.
The difference in labor as shown, between
now and in 1866, is mainly owing to improve-
ments in machinery and iucreased production.
In 1865 the hours of labor were reduced from
twelve to eleven hours per day.
The treasurer estimates that about one in
every eight of our adult males owns tbe house
in which he lives, and probably about tbe same
proportion "lay up something every year."
Of the adult females I presume not more than
one in twenty saves anything from her wages,
WAGES OF FBINTEBS.
The wages of the workmen at the office of
the Utica Morning Herald, Utica, New York,
are as follows:
1860. I860. 1872.

thousand ems  $0 23 $0 33i $0 40

IRON.
The Rome Iron-Works, employing on an
average two hundred and seventy-five men,
pay an average of $2 25 per day. Common
laborers earn $1 50 per.day. About a hun-
dred lay up a part of their wages; and nearly
one hundred and fifty are the owners of houses.
At the Frankliu Iron-Works one hundred
and fifty men are employed. Of these one
hundred and twenty-five receive an average
of $1 75 per day, and twenty-five an average
of $2 50 per day. Forty occupy their own
houses.
The Utica Steam-Engine Company in 1860
paid workmen an average of $1 28 per day ;
in 1865, $2 81 per day; in 1872, $2 26 per day.
Tbe wages range from fifty cents, for boys, to
$3 50 per day. Of one hundred and twenty
men, twenty have houses of their own.
The wages in a leading shoe factory at Utica,
New York, are reported as follows:
1865. 1872.
Per week. Per week.
Experienced shoemakers $10 @$15 $18@$21
Women  3 50@ 6 5© 9
These tables show that since the war closed
general wages have advanced, and the rate
ranges variously, even as much as double for
some kinds of skilled labor, and from ten to
thirty-three per cent, on the average, with
some rare cases unchanged. American work-
men are thus improving in condition. They
protest against lawyers, theorists, and politi-
cians assailing their industry and overthrow-
ing the fabric of our prosperity.
Contrast, also, the wages on either side of
Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence, in Canada
and the United States. The figures for the
United States are from the table from the
Bureau of Statistics, July 12, 1870, and are
stated in gold ; those for Canada are furnished
to me by a representative of this Government
in the Dominion:
