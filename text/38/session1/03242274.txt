NEW CENSUS IN 18G5.
Mr. WILSON asked, and by unanimous con-
sent obtained, leave to introduce a joint resolu-
tion (S. No. 53) providing for the taking of a
census of the United States; which was read
twice by its title.
Mr. WILSON. Mr. President, thisjointres-
olution authoiizes the taking of the census in
1865, leaving the officer in chaige of the woi k lib-
eity to avail himself of the labors of such States
as shall (numerate then-inhabitants m that year.
The importance of understanding the numerical
and arms-bearing population and the resources of
the country is clear to the comprehension of men
of intelligence. We cannot, in view of the great
questions of legislation that force themselves upon
the consideration of the practical minds of the
country,over-estimate the value of the informa-
tion to be deiived from the ascertainment of the
-I population and the capacity and resouices of the
1 couutiy. A new census will furnish accuiate in-
formation in regard to the productive and unpro-
ductive wealth of the country, the changes which
have been wrought in manufactures and the me-
chanic arts, and the effects of the war upon our
population and resources. A census, 1 am con-
fident, will demonstiate theenergeticcharacterof
our people, and the facility with which they vary
their resources, in adapting themselves readily to
!! circumstances, and give confidence m our ability
!i to pay pioniptly the inteiests and principal of our
accumulating national debts. If the taking of the
'j census is postponed until 1870 we may be in
11 doubt ourselves touching the reality of our prog-
ress, and other nations may consider us as ex-
j! hausted and enfeebled by this long civil war. By
Ij postponing the taking of the census to 1870 we
\\ lose the opportunity of ascertaining the real and
il immediate influence of this state of war on 'he
progress of our numbers and resources, as the
rapid changes incident to the return of peace serve
to obscure the real effects of the war. It is espe-
cially important not only to know the degree of
prosperity or adversity attending the people, but
to understand how much of either is due to the
state of war and what the result of the condition
of peace.
The resources of the nation are better ascer-
tained by a census which is not used directly as
a basis of taxation than they are by any system
of inquiry adapted directly to the attaining of
revenue; so is a census of population more val-
uable as to the number of men of military ages
than is any system of enrollment. The experi-
ence of other nations demonstrates the truth of
this proposition. Many deeply interesting social
questions will be solved by a census taken in
1865, after, as we hope, the close of this gigantic
war. The determination to take the census then
will show to the world that the American people
entertain no fears respecting the developments of
a census. I move the reference of this resolution
to the Committee on the Judiciary, an'd commend
it to their careful consideration.
The motion was agreed to.
