Note.-
-The percentage increase in revenue in 1880, compared with the last year of the high rates, is 98£. The percentage increase in expenditures*, for the same period, is 244 1-5.
It will be perceived that the per cent, increase !
of expenditures is much larger than that of rev- j
enue. These expenditures indicate the increased
mail facilities of the country. During the fust
six years, with high rates prevailing:, both rev-
enue and expenditures, with the exception of one
year, were nearly stationary and nearly equal.
After the reduction of rate to five and ten cents
the revenues fell off for three years, the expend-
itures continuing about the same; but the ex-
penditures and mail facilities steadily increased
from 1840, and the revenues came up with them
so far thatduring the three years 1849,1850, and !
1851, thoDepartment was self-sustaining, the only ;
period during the twenty-two yems in which it ,
proved so. On the 1st of July, 1851, the three ,
cent prepaid rate went into operation. The rev-
enues again fi ll off for three yeais following; but .
the cxpendituies went on largely inrreusing with ,
the accompanying increase of postal facilities, '
and continued to expand in a greater ratio than '
the revenues during the remaining period. There ,
was also a steady and largo increase in the pop- ;
illation and business of the country, for which
due allowance should he made during each period.
So in England the cost of management has in- ,
creased, during the period since tii<> reduction of ,
rates, from <£750*909, in 1839, to 003,110, in j
1861. The gross revenue in 1839 was390,703,
and the net revenue <£1,003,701. The ^rosa revo- |
nue in 1801, although over *£1,000,000 greater!
than in 1839, yielded a net revenue less than in '
1839 by over <£100,000. |
Thus also our deficiency under the last year of1
high rates (1845) was only $30,K90 10, while in
1800, the last complete year before the interrupt ion 1
ofour postal service, it amounted to 50,350,533 33, !
although the gross levenue was increased at the ,
same tune by $4,268,Si'>5 5J. The increase of!
postal revenue from 1845 lo 1800, exclusive of;
congressional grants, was 98.50 per cent., while !
ihe increase ot postal expendiUues in the same j
period was 244.20 per cent.
From these data it appears that there has been
an enormous mrrenso of postal facilities and postal
expenses in both countries under the low rates,
beyond those existing under the high rates, and ;
their effect must have been to stimulate cone-
spondenceto a remarkable degree. An omnibus :
running two or thiee times a day along the streets ;
of a city would not much stimulate passenger i
traffic; but cars, running every three or live nun- :
utes, and accommodating, at the same rate, four :
times the number of passengers, are crowded with '
travelers. !
In my opinion, it may be regarded as un axiom '
in postal ailairs that certainly, frequency, andficil- ,
ity of postal communication injlucncc the amount of''
correspondence more than do any variations i)i a mod-, \
erate tariff. 'j
Itrequind in England eleven years of the low |i
rates, and largely expanded facilities, to restore i!
the gross levenue lo its original amount. The !'
amount of net revenue of 1&3S had not been again
realized in that kingdom at the date of their last
annual report, published in lbG^, twenty-two
years thereafter.
The lower rates in the United States, of five
and ten cents, yielded in the last year in which
they prevailed (1851) agrossrevenue of$6,410,004.
That -amount was not again reached under the
three cent prepaid rate until 1855, although this
low rate had the cooperation of far greater facili-
ties and expenditures. On the 1st of July that
year, the five ccntunpaid rate was abolished, leav-
ing the standard rate of three cents under three
thousand miles, and ten cents over that distance;
but that change produced no sensible effect upon
the revenue.
These facts, taken in connection with the fur-
ther fact that the rate is now so low as to be no
appreciable burden upon correspondence,indicate
that a further reduction of 33g per cent, would not
appreciably stimulate correspondence, and that
the present amount of revenue would not be again
reached, under the proposed still lower rate of two
cents, until the natuial inci case of correspondence,
arising Aom the meieasc of population, of busi-
ness, and of postal facilities, shall have buen suf-
ficient to pioduce that sum.
in further exhibition of the data nppettaining
to-this discussion, I annex a table (No. 527} show-
ing the postal teceipts and expenditures, with the
population of the United States, and the late per
cipita for eight decennial periods, from 1790 to
1800, and annually from 1850 to 1805.
There is another « lenient m the Ihidsh system
which has been generally overlooked. 13i>th un-
der the high rates and the low rates of postage,
that department was not only self-sustaining, but
yitlded a not revenue to the Government. All its
reductions have been made upon a net revenue.
The proposed reduction in this country is asked
upon a deficiency. I should be the first to ask a
reduced rate upon a surplus revenue, as, in my
opinion, the correspondence of the country should
never he taxed for levenue purposes. But the
proposition to reduce a low rate to a lower in the
face of a large deficiency requires a conclusive
showing that an increase of revenue would result
m excels of the natuial increase arising from
ordinary causes. Instead of this showing, the
advocates of the measure admit that for several
years the revenue would fall essentially below Us
present standard; and they fail to show a com-
mensurate extraordinary increase of correspond-
ence.
These considerations should have their due
weight with the advocates of the adoption of the
rate established by the Enghtdi system.
The terms " low and uniform postage" are not
absolute, but iclative. The United States Govern-
ment have nir< ady adopted a 'Mow" postage.
Considered with relation to the extent of its trans-
portation, it is lower than prevails in any other
country.
The annual t -ansportation of mails in the Uni-
ted Kingdom, by railways, steamers, and other
vehicles, is about 05,000,000 mdes, excluding
foot transportation. In this country, it is about
53,000,U0i) miles. The number of miles of such
transportation there },.-r week day amounts to
80,^81. Here, tiie amount is 170,709 miles. (See
table No. 2G.) Considering tlie i elation between
rates of postage and amount of transportation, it
will be seen that our transportation of mails is
over 100 per cent, greater than the British; while
our general rate of postage is only 50 per cent,
greater. In addition to this comparative state-
ment, our postage on local (or drop) letters ii§ 50
per cent, less than their rate.
To this question I have given the most careful
considerationduringthe pastyear,and have cheer-
fully received and entertained the various propo-
sitions coming to me from all sources in the inter-
est of reform. I acknowledge my indebtedness
to the gentlemen contributing them for many im-
portant suggestions. But they have failed to con-
vince me that it is a present duty, or sound policy,
to reduce the rate of letter postage upon general
correspondence from three cents to two cents, a
reduction of one third upon a low existing rate.
Our present rate was adopted, and is still univer-
sally regarded, as a low postage. The revenues
under it are steadily increasing in amount, and
approximating the self-sustaining point, equiva-
lent to expenditures. It is not regarded as oner-
ous, in any degree, upon the correspondence of
the country. The proposed reduction, therefore,
not being made from an excess of revenues, would
only compel the people to pay by a new property
tax what they pay now, without a complaint, iu
proportion to the amount of their correspondence.
It would only shift the deficiency, to pay with the
left hand what they now pay with the right.
These facts appear to me to settle the deban .
so far as it rests upon the point of so-called "low"
postage. The United States low rate, as now
established, is, in principle and in fact, the lowest
postage hitherto adopted by any Government.
Our system is defective, however, in the other
branch of proposed reform, that of uniformity. In
this respect 1 do not hesitate to recommend a
change. But this term, again, is not absolute, but
relative. Neither the English nor any other sys-
tem isabsoliUely uniform. The practical question
is one of the proper degree of approximation to
uniformity.
From the best data accessible to me, the esti-
mated loss of revenue from accrued postages on
printed matter approximates two hundred thou-
sand dollai s annually. The loss principally arises
from the failure of postmasters to collect quarterly
in advance, as requii ed by law, the small amounts
due from subset ibers and for the unpaid transit of
transient printed matter. In view of the ccrtuin
collections of postages, prepayment on punted
matter is more important than upon letters.
if it seemed to Congress practicable to combine
the proper postage tariff with the internal tax upon
newspapers, so as to leave them to pass tree
through the mails, this plan might prove satisfac-
tory to publishers and just to the revenue of the
Department. Ifpublisheis would findltconsistent
with their intmcKt to require the annual postal
charge to be added to the price of publication,and
collected therewith, they prepaying the postage
upon their circulation, this would also remedy the
evil. But with or without such change in legisla-
tion, I recommend a great reduction m the variety
of rates on printed matter for domestic circulation,
abolishing all distinction of rates based on differ-
ent distances of transportation, adopting decima1
rates conforming to the coinage of this country
instead of the fractional rates now prevailing, ant.
equalizing the charges now varied according to
distance.
I propose to submit to Congress the draft of a
bill for that purpose as soon as the details are set-
tled.
In further approximation to uniformity, I recom-
mend that the postage upon transient newspapers
and other printed matter, whether destined inland
