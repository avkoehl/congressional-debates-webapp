The destruction of the train by rebels yesterday makes it more necessary that the trains of the troops coming from the east be forwarded after them with all dispatch. Lieutenant-Colonel Mackay, chief quartermaster Thomas' corps, has visited the scene, and reports that about 350 wagons have been burned, and the mules killed and driven off by the rebels. A few mules will be gathered in the woods, and some recaptured.
