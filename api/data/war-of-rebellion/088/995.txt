HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 24, 1864.

Major-General BIRNEY:

I am going out, by General Hancock's order, to see what arrangement to make about relieving your line. Will you please send a staff officer to meet me at the ruins of the Davis house at 3 o'clock to ride over the line and give me information as to the position of troops, &amp;c.? I will have our chief of artillery with me.

C. H. MORGAN,

Lieutenant-colonel, &c.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 24, 1864.

Major-General BIRNEY:

I have directed General Miles and Colonel Smyth to commence relieving your line at dark. General Miles will occupy from Battery 13 to the right and Colonel Smyth from Battery 13 to the Norfolk railroad. The chief of artillery has also been directed to commence relieving your artillery at dark. I presume he has seen Colonel Jackson by this time. If he has not, I will direct him to confer with him. He is now on the line. I have directed my commanders not to relieve your picket-line to-night, as I want to try to get a chance to look around in the morning and see where they are. Colonel Smyth has sent officers to arrange with General Terry and General Miles has seen General Foster. Please notify your commanders what time I begin.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH CORPS,September 24, 1864.

Major-General HANCOCK:

My chief of artillery missed Colonel Morgan. If your chief could report here mine would explain the entire line to him in relieving the batteries. My cavalry escort picket the river-bank. It will require about fifty cavalry to relieve them, although infantry would be as well.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 24, 1864-4.40 p.m.

Major-General BIRNEY:

Colonel Morgan has not returned and I do not think [he will] be back before dark. If you do not see him before that time it would be better to send your chief of artillery here, as I will have use for Colonel Morgan for a few hours after he returns in issuing the necessary orders for the change, and it would delay matters if he were absent so long as it would take for him to go to your headquarters and return.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
