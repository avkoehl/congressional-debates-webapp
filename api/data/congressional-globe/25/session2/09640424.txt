as irresponsible as ever were the priesthood of anti-
quity, to the people whom they fleeced without
mercy.
Yes, sir, bankcraft in whatev er light you view it,
is a legitimate offspring of those institutions of craft,
by which the idle, the cunning and luxurious, have
in all ages and all nation  availed themselves to
rob industry of its profits and labor of its rewards.
Sir, the institution is the same, with a trifling mo-
dification not at all improved, but m witly devices,
in extracting by stealth the substance from those it
impoverishes   us  attributes are   many of them
identical and analogous, striking and impressive.   !l
Ti eir secret conclaves, by which their business is
governed and controlled, are precisely the same,
their medes of extortion the same, their often coming
in conflict with their Gov eminent, where Ihey failed  |
to get the entire control of it, identical, and their ob-  i
jects and effects upon the people are the same and   i
inseparable.   Their armies of pensioned stipendia-   |
nes and dependants, have every resemblance, and   '
stand always ready at a beck or a nod to denounce
and proscribe those who even doubt their infalli-
bility and purity, and as was with the poor heretic,
a reward awaits the favorite that shall prove most
distinguished in hunting down the political «cept.c
and disbeliever, who thus dares to question their
divine right, to the first fruits of the earth    Sir,
look around yon and behold the army of them that
are continually crying bank,  bank, bank, bank,
examine the matenal of which they are composed,
and my life upon it, you will not find one twenti-
eth part who calculate on living either by industry   |
or labor    No, sir, but upon their capital, their
speculations,  their traffics, shaving, jobbing, and   ,
the like, all to be benefitted, supported, and en-    j
nched out of the products of the industrious labor   I
er, planter, mechanic, u.anufactuiei, and farmei,  i
who alone give substantial weali'i and true pros-
penty to a nation    Your bankess and capitalists
enrich m part of ojr country, nor improve no pait
of its soil, and many of them, as pnests ol old, with
their monks, and their friars at their heets, are   j
mere di ones in society, 'hat live upon the labor of   j
the moie industrious ci the hive
Sir, are the people o the United States prepared  |
longer to endure thi-> system of conupaon, with its
mo«t demoializmg tendencies'2   Will they longe,.
endure it, wiihout holding iH authors to the strictest    j
accountability '    Do they not see the consequences    I
of this bankcraft,  from  us  intimate  relation and
most striKing analogy to its great paitnt, priestcraft,    !
that has depopulated, demolished,  and   impove-    i
rished, more nations, than any visitation of Provi-
dence hi? ever effected by fue, the sword, or pesh-    l
lenlitl disease     Sir, m  my opinion,  the age is too    .
far in advance oí civilization, of sc ence, and in-  '
telhgence, for f>>em ever to submit to a system so
oppressive, so unjust, so degrading, to all the nobler
feelings of our nature.
The American people are too free, too much en-
lightened, too intelligent, to accept this old system    '
of rapme and plunder of the fruits of their indus-
try, oy the mere change ot names.   Banlaaft is
priesld afí M disguise, and its effects, in ihe end,
cannot prove to the common people, the laboring  |
classes, and productive interests, less destructive,   |
distressing, and devastating    Ye , sir, and this is   '
the sylem that your Government, aad the whole
Democracy, are denounced and proscribed for re-   I
fusing their countenance lo    This is the system   i
that jour Philadelphia Bank Delphian  oíades aie    ¡

nounced and proscnoed by your  Cougnssionii

they fail longer to understand this game,  that has

quence of bank-bought attor leys and advocates,    I

continual appeal to then fears, and the creation of

whole productive interests of the land, that they
pillaged of the fruits of its labor and industry.
Sir, the authors of these enormities cannot, will
not, fail sooner or later to be overtaken by the
i rath of an indignant, robbed, and insulted
people
It, then, the truism is correct, that like causes
produce like effects in all ages and nations, what
have we to expect from the subs itution of bank-
craft for the great parent, that, for so many ages
and centuries, has afflicted almost every civilized
nation upon the globe, and at different epochs has
delugei , em with carnage and blood Sir, na-
tions, like individuals, who will not be instructed
by ihe lessons ot wisdom and experience, must be
blind indeed, and must expect to reap in gaul and
bitterness the harvest of their ignominy and folly
Yet tms is one of those beautiful systems that the
gieat new-born Whig partv i  now struggling to
linpov: upon the freemen of my countrj, and for a
faithful, determined opposition to vvnich, this Ad-
ministration is denounced and proscribed, and the
whole Democracy declared too illiterate and stupid
to perceive ihe sublime benefits of the system. Being
already in possession of ths capital of the country,
they wield with more dexterity and expedition those
engines that operate most powerfully en public
opinion Public presses are not only by them pur-
chased and suborned, but, with the greatest facility
and expedition, created in every section of the
country, to play as a battery and fortress on pub-
lic sentiment, for the benefit of the craft, and herein
they possess an incomparable advantage over, and
which was unknown to, those prototype institutions
to which those of modem date possess such an im-
pressive and sinking analogy 111 all their attr.butes
01 operation and deception
There is scarcely at this time a smgie public
press 111 the who'e ccmtij, distinguished in the
ranks of that partv, tnat has no* been set up by, or
aided with, the iacdities, or under some influence,
of soi„e one bank or other, in which it is directly 01
indirectly connected, and, sir, with such a g gantic
machine operating with an mdefatigability that ne-
vei tires, can it be marvelled at that public opinion
should be frequently kd as*ra>, and the own, best,
dearest interests of our country renounced' No,
sir, 119 S'r, aijed by such machines, operating
with the most uniform sv^tem the odds art  against
the people and the country, and nothing can rebuke
it, dissipate it, 01 extermínale it, but the intelli-
gence of an active, en'erpnsng, intellectual, spi-
rited people, its strength, as of old, lies in Us deep
and mysterious opera ion on public opinion, which,
when once exposed, (like the powers of the Pope
who would anathematize) nothmg becomes more
feeble, di=giaceful, nor con empUble Let, then,
the people go to work to expose 11, let the Demo
cracy be aroused, and like " dew drops fiom tne
lion's n.ane," will fall this incubus upon public sen-
timent Sir, this people cannot be ensla/ed, if tney
will presume to act, andju )g , and think for them-
selves It ¡s against the arts and devices oí a most
formidable irterni, and insinuating enemy that
thpy are no.v called upon to sally m defence 1 f their
rights. Sir, the a'idmarks are sufficiently cnalked
out for each part> to tell upon what side they stpnd,
and the true p?rty of the people and the country
rave only to guard afiinn foul flags and false
names, and victory is theirs
I will now, Mr Speaker, call the attention of
the House to a lew )emarks that fell from the ho-
norable gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mi Ser-
geant ] Tnat g=ntleman, after an address of
three hours or moie, not more man tvventy minute 
of which he devoted to the bil' on the table, v ent
into a general attack upon ive measures of ..uisand
tie preceding Administration Th„ honor£lj ¿
member tells us that he v. as opposed to the bJi be-
cause it proposed to make papel > ioney Tris
was certainly c ne of trie wonders- oí tne age, thai
that gen'eman should be opposed to ? measure
because it authorized ths making of paper money
What, a gentleman opposi ! to any measure to
make paper money, when he is sent here, almost
solely, by an institution whose \ ery existence de-
pends upon its privilege to issue papsr money. He
opposed to any measure because it issues paper
money    What an  exüaordmaiy   atUttide does
H. of Reps.
that genileman assume, who has, and does now, m
every speech that he makes, advocate the banks m
their most unlimited, unrestricted privilege of
making paper money' He opposed to paper mo-
ney, and how? He wishes that his idol, the Bank
of the United States in Pmladelphia, should have
alone this privilege. He would have it to mono-
polize the whole paper money making power, and
the balance of the country contributing to this mo-
nopoly. Does this gentleman, who undertakes to
play the "Delphm orach" here, think that there is
not enough intelligence in the country to delect
his flimsy designs'! He would have no other
power or institution to make paper money but his
own dear bank on Chestnut street1 No, not even
the Government of the peopie    How monstrous,
I  had liked to have said how arogant, absurd, and
ridiculous The gentleman from Philadelphia is
the last man in this House that should raise his
voice against pappr money, w hen he contradicted,
by every act of his life, the sincerity of his own de-
clarations He was the special representative of
that interest.
That gentleman, whenever it suited his purpose,
was m the habit of charging the Executive and th"
whole party, with the acis and language of a par-
ticular individual—the chairman of the Committee
of Ways and Means, [Mr. Cambrelei>& ] To
this he objected, as disingenuous, unreasonable,
and unfair, and it could not be sustained by anv fair,
honorable mode of debate He was very unwilling
that either himself or the Administraron should be
held responsible for the acts or «sentiments of any
individual member, here or elsewhere, and to at-
tempt it, was a mere catch, to allure.
The honorable member had said much about the
interest of the people, and the fuendship of the
banks ?nd bankers for the peoole This really
put mm in mmd of the Devil seivmg God The
banks' friendship for the people, all past and pre-
sent history had shown, was that of the "lion for
the lamb " It was on the labot and interest of
this people upon which they lived and fattened,
and it was well for them occasionally to use to-
wards them honeyed words, and to flatter them.
That gentleman had held foith on this occasion, the
same language neaily that he had m his minority
report, fiom the Committee of Wajs and Means,
which was certa nly one of the most complete
pieces of demagogueism, and feeble adempts to
flatter and cajole the peopie for the wiorgs that his
Bank had done them, that had ever been put for-
\ ard in th s country The people—the people—
me precious people—was the whole burden ot that
gentleman's song ihroughoi t that report, and he
ek n had taken pretty mucn t'.e same course m
his i^narks >esterday and to-da> He nad never
read the ieport \ ithout smiling a the frequent re-
petition of the word people—people—it contained,
and he wou'd refer gentlemen 10 it for their espe-
cial edificaron The gentleman had agam, in his
discourse upon this subject, mounted the peopie.
INow, Mr Speaker, m all conscience, I do think
that the honorable member has carr'ed on this
farcelong encugh, mat the especial repiesentative
of a bank =nd 11  interest, s louid become the
champion of the people'  rgnts, caps the cl.max of
the ridiculous—for one who has Been m the ser-
vice ol the banks ¡or years, to make such profes-
sions, is adding insult to ínjoiy, and can result
on1; to the disparagement of him that attempts it.
What, s r, does the gentleman look upon us all
as children' Surely he does? Else he would not
attempt in this bare faced way to sooihe u , b<- pat-
ting and pitying us, and tellms  u-> lie sti", be quiet
sood people, while his institutions are r bbing them
of the last vital drop of their life's ulood, But this
is oniv one of the o'd \sa\s that has been íesorted
to by "the Crajt family " To get the people to sub-
mit to their exactions extortion, and oppression,
the   mos-t astounding efforts   weie   about being
II ade to convince the countrj, tn-st the Danks were
the people, and the 1 jhorable gentlemen had tak«n
the 'e 0 m this attempt, which I have not language
to characterize respectiully.
To convince the people that the banks were
themselves, and that the mteiest of the bank 
uas then interest, such was not only insulting, but
monstrous    It was upon the interest of the people
