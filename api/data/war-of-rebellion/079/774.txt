be stationed in the woods opposite the mouth of White Oak Creek; as the enemy might concentrate in the bend of the creek, out of sight, and make arrangements for crossing. The cliffs on the south side command those on this, and they might station batteries near point U to drive away our men. The proposed works at Polly's Bend, however, will command this point as well as the river crossing. AT the mouth of Aldridge's Branch I think a few riflemen will be sufficient to prevent crossing. A battery might be stationed at point W if necessary. The works at Polly's Bend will, if built, render this unnecessary.

Pollys' Bend. -WEST of the camp the river makes a large bend, doubling on itself, the peninsula thus formed surrounded by vertical cliffs and has only two outlets -a road to the north winding down the hill-side, running some distance under the cliff, fording the river, and ascending the opposite side by a zigzag, and the neck of land to the south. The road can be protected by a few riflemen, as the enemy would have to advance a mile under fire, at short range, without the opportunity for returning it, and no shelter. The neck of land is only about 500 feet across, and susceptible of very strong defense. See accompanying plan. It is proposed to build a redoubt on the highest point and an infantry intrenchment on each side, connecting it with the cliff. On the left an eqaulement for field guns should be guilt to command the crossing of the Kentucky River, near the mouth of White Oak Creek, already referred to. In front of the works several lines of strong abatis should be made as the material is abundant, and it will make it unnecessary to give much relief to the earth-works. For 500 yards to the front the ground will be well swept by the fire from the redoubt, and with 400 men the position cannot be taken by any force. Point V in Pollys' Bend, if in possession of the enemy, would be the best position from which he could shell the depot. The distance is only one mile and most of the buildings can be seen from and are commanded by it. A concentric fire from the camp can be brought to bear on this point, but the ground is so broken by sinks and ridges that it would be difficult to dislodge him, especially if he used mortars or howitzers from the sink holes.

Fort Bramlette. -This occupies ground which would be dangerous if in the hands of the enemy. It is useful also from the reverse fire it can bring on the hills east of Hickman Creek, and its commanding the ground the enemy would occupy with batteries to cover their passage of the Kentucky River, at the bridge. It also puts into our possession the hill to the west, which will assist very much in the defense of the bridge. It is proposed to build a battery for field guns at point X to command the valley and turnpike across the river, also a battery at point Y to protect the end of the infantry intrenchments to the right of Bramlette, and a battery and infantry intrenchment at point Z to protect the line to the left and military road. A field battery of four guns will be sufficient for these three last-named points; it can be moved as required. As far as possible the work has been done by detailed soldiers, prisoners, and negro recruits; the proportion of work so done will be seen by referring to Appendix C. * Tools have been furnished by the quartermaster' department's there being a large quantity on hand in the depot. Lumber was sawed by the Government mills. The many facilities afforded by the quartermaster's department did much to forward the work and diminish the expense.

CAMP BURNSIDE, KY.

These works were commenced February 25, 1864, by T. C. Ruggles, assistant engineer in charge, and were suspended August 12, 1864, on account of proposed abandonment of the post. For map showing progress of the works at date of suspension see Appendix A, and for proposed armament (though guns forwarded in partial fulfillment of requisition never reached the post, they having been diverted at Nashville by order of Major-General Schofield) see Appendix B.

DEFENSES OF Kentucky CENTRAL RAILROAD.

These consist of stockades at all the important railroad bridges between Covington and Paris, were constructed by Captain W. E. Merrill, Corps Engineers, under orders from General H. G. Wright, commanding Department of the Ohio, in the fall and winter of 1862- '63, and were made partially bomb-proof, trimmed, and sodded under my instructions, agreeably to orders from Major General A. E. Burnside, in the summer of 1863. For map and plans see Appendix A.
