
Lieutenant J. H. Butler, Second Artillery, was very cool, brave, and active, and I am greatly indebted to him for the efficient condition of the battery before the battle. Lieutenant J. S.

GENERAL: In compliance with instructions received from you I left camp yesterday morning at 7.30 o'clock with three regiments of my brigade, for the purpose of extending our line of pickets in conjunction with those of Hooker's division. On entering the woods in front of the abatis I deployed four companies of the Sixty-third Pennsylvania as skirmishers, with six companies as reserves, following in three columns.

My skirmishers soon became engaged with the enemy's pickets and drove them back on their supports, when the firing becoming brisk and the right of my line of skirmishers being for a moment repulsed, I ordered forward the Eighty-seventh New York.
