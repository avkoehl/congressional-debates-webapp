was to pay the directors a salary and exclude tlipm
from all participation n loan5; or the use of the
Batik cppital. He referred to the experience oí
the abuses of ¡he B ink of Alabama by directors,
to prove that it was imposs b e lo have an impir
tial and honest management without exclude
thiol ¡rom. the use of the money themselves. He
then referred to the abu e and mischief which on-
ginaied in the loans to members of Congre^.
He alto called tne attention of the Senators in
the slat sues of iho~e political accommo talons.
He showed that in the res*ion when the rechartor
was pend'ng, forty-four members hud almost «i
half million of bank money m their pockets. He
gave this statistical accoun :
In 1830 it loaned  to 52 members $192,101
" 1831           "            .30       "         39á,100
" 1832           "            44       "         478 069
" 1833           "            58       "         374,766
" 1834           "           52       "         238 586
Making §1 675 C22 loaned to 365 memben. of
Congre&s wiüun five years
This fact vva. known to ¡he public, but ih1
names of the Loricnveis vcie not kno vn. Trie
odium, wrli suspicion of corruption, fell on all Q't
members He was unwnling lo share in the di crace,
ai he was unwil'mg to participate in dividing the
wages of corrupuon.
Mr. ALLEN no'iced the contrast between the
legislation which made it fjony in a Sub-Tit asurei
to use one dollar ot p'j> 1 c money, and that wh ch
now ordered the Government mon>y not only to
be lent ou', but proviües that the rew Sab-Ttea-
iurrrs m^y lend eveiy dollar of the pjbne mon^y
to themse ves These rlir>-c ors are lo pivs judg-
ment onnotes fordi conn , thpy will pass judgmeit
that iheir own are good, and n me other; ?nd thus
loan to themselves all ih? public funds. He washed
it to be b irne ia mmd that this is pub! c money—■
it btlongs to the people; yet the directors, tha
Government officers of the institution, may loin
it all to them<elv-s ar>d their friend-, contrary to
the spirit of tne ietamcd clause of the Sub-Treasu-
ry law. The Senator Irora Kentucity sajs that a
great deal must be left to the Administration. The
President has the appointment of three directors,
and may influence two; and thus, through the dis
cretionary power of the Administration, may con-
trol the public purse as well as the swwd, and use
all for his own re-election, &o. Thus you come here
to pass mis measure to control future elections,
&c. With regard to the members of Congress, he was
the first that found that pari of the report disclosing
the secret of tne Bank loans to them. He fo ind it
by accident, and told it to the farmers, and they
were aston'shed. All can recollect the effect—
from forty to fifty members of Congress hal bor-
rowed mjre rnonsy m five years than they received
from the Tieasury for ihcir service. TVey were
better paid by the Bank than by the counti}, aiid
therefore served ihe B<mk b^t. What safety c^uld
there be against such influence] We w.U talk of
these things on ci'ermg the broad arena before
the people, where no silence can be imposed when
this act is passed, rnd we will have to repeal it.
Genllemen may, for the present, entrench them-
selves bbhind the shield of silence, but w 11, in the
end, find they have sinned away their day of grace
The motion was s ill further debated bv Messr-,
WOODBURY ana WALKER in the aftim , i<e,
and Messrs CL1Y of K< ntacky and BSRRIPN
in opposition. The question w&s ll en divided,
