Repeal of Independent Treasury—Mr. Pearee.
H. of Reps.

'r Note—The amount of ten percent asstatedmthis table, is
Jn addition to the five per cent to be received under the com
pacta, but it may not be improper to remark that there are large
quantities of waste and worthies lands that can never be sold in
the States having apparently the greatest quantity withm their
limits, and hence the disparity between them is notsogreat as
it would appear at first blush
I will detain the Senate no longer on the part of the bill upon
which I have thought proper to comment I would willingly
have been spared the necessity of these remarks, but I thought
It due to the Senate, as well as to others desuous of seeing the
light m which 1 viewed this important eubject, that I should
tmplify the report which I had the honor of submitting to the
enate, so as to enable those who differ from me to examine the
grounds upon which the matter is placed, so fai as I am con
cerned I will, however, lead to the Senate a statement show
ing the condition of the public lands, and the course of their
administration, which may be useful m the further considera
tion of the subject *   [See next column.]
A single woidon the other part of thebil', which contains the
prospective pre empuon punciple and I have done That
measuieis so generally understood, it has at this day so few
opponents, that Ido not think it necessary to go into an argu
nient to sustain it The present bill is well guarded, the bene
fits resulting from it will inure exclusively to the actual set
tier, and the other provisions will be found to be judicious and
wise The bill mayiequue some amendments other than those
recommended by the eommittee If so, let them be made, aftei
■w hich, I trust and hope that the bill may become a law I feel
that this is the accepted time for it to receive the sanction of
th s body, it has already passed the popular branch, the reve
nue question can be sa ísfactonlyai ranged, asa bill is before us
to supply thedeficit to be created by diveuing this fund from
the public treasuiy These measures are loudly called for by
the public voice And from their operation in connection with
the other gieat national measures that have already parsed the
Senate, J do not doubt thatthe nation will find relief fiom her
temporaiy embairassments, with increased strength she will
puisueher onward course to her destined greatness and power,
while the people will prosper under out fiee institutions and
glorious Constitution
It is urged that the land fund will be needed for national pur
poses, and the Senator from Missouri, [Mr Lijsn] following out
the idea, has  given notice of a motion to amend the bill hy ¿p
propnatmg this fund to national defences I know the sincerity
of the Senator m making this proposition, and let me assure
him I fully concur with him m the piopnety of strengthening
out national arm of defence We only differ as to the funds out
of which that pteparatioo shall be made I contend fot this dis
tnbut on as d. necessary measure to enable the people to use m
their strength to the defence of the country Let this fund be
u°ed foi the ielief of an embarrased and oppressed Deopi^ and
sup^y us place by a levy of imports, as is now proposed The
duties will be paid alone by those who chouse to consume the
foreign article, as I have already said, while the distiibution
will be felt by the humblest citizen in the land, who may never
use an article upon which a duty islevied Do this, <tnd you
rely upon it, whenever the people are requited tocóme up to
the defence of the country, you will find them there, not ar
rayed m parties, as we are, but as une man Fori tiust the
time never will come, when we shall refuse on party grounds,
at the call of our country, to rally around her standard, and
bring to her support our united energies in her just andhonora
ble defence Sir, the defences of the country will be provided
for, whether this bill pass oi not But refuse to distribute it on
ground that it may be needed, and, my wordibi it, the necessity
will be created
1 he senator from Missouri, [Mr Beaton ] the other day, de
clared, what every one knows to be true, that there is a conti-
nued dram from the West of the precious metals, and no natu-
ral return I have felt that state of the case existing for years,
and I have complained of it on this fiooi without effect, but I
now see a prospect of a return, through this bill, of a portion
of ths money that is drawn from us, and I call upon Western
Senators to look at the matter in that light
Sir, we have ueen called upon in a voice clear and audible,
to give to the measures in which we have been and aie still
engaged at this extia session the forms of law The people
havecalledfoi. them, and weas their agents arebound to cairy
them out It they be wise and judicioua, as we su[ pose, such
wil* bathe decision of our common c mstuuents, if however,
lo this they as w^ll as ourselves should be mistaken, the error
will be coirected by the experience of Uio=e affected by ourac
tion, and we shall be compelled to either conform oai legisla
tion to that conected public opinion, Oi surrender the seals and
our placea heie to our political opponents Let every Whig
*hen co Tie manfully up to the work, and take his share of'he
responsibility There is no escape—no special pleading will
avail We must stand or fall upon the wisdom of our mea
sures, and their just and beneficial results upon the mterestsof
the people The lecent revolution effected by puohc opi
nion—the cordemnation of the la=*t Administration and
its Sub Treasury hard money measures, and the sig
nal overtnrow of those in power, present a por ion of
history enti led to our thoughtful contemplation I advert to
this o admonish gentlemen not to i el y for escape on the ab
gence of a vote oi ever a vote against anv par icular measure
We stand oi fall upon out policy If we stand we all stand to
gether, if we fa !, tve must and should share the same fate I
«Kim noexemption I lully concur with the great majoruv of
the Whigs of the nation n  the wisdom of oui policy, but if th^y
should prove otherwise, it is the duty as well as the right of
the people to rectify anj eirors into which we shall have fallen
The Government was formed foi them, and it ou^hf to be admi
mstered for their benefit
Before I take leave uf this subject, the Senate wnl excuse
me for recurring asa.m to the portion assumed that the people
are not represented under the last census This is one of the
grounds u pon which our political opponents intend to go to the
people and demand the repeal of the Bank char ei, and it is
possible that the same argument may be applied to this bill,
should it pass and become a law hir, let ¡senators beware of
that sword—it is not a two edged one, cutting both ways—it
cutsthoie alone whorely upon the popular will as manifested
in the elections of 1840, and who profess to rely upon a repre
«entation under the last census for the repeal of either the
Bank law or of this Distribution measure Repeal' Ay that is
to be the Democratic watchword, say Senators Contracts are
nothing public faith is nothing, vested rights are nothing Re
peal, repeal, say gentlemen I confess I utterly abhor the
idea  it is nullification run mad, and let me tell gentlemen
they never will succeed in their unholy purposes until the
people are lost to every sense of justice, and are prepared to
deny the utility of our present lorm of Government, until esta
Wished laws shall give place to open anarchy Nay, moie,
such doctrines can never be sanctioned until the independence

REMARKS OF MR. J. A. PEARCE,
OF MARYLAND.
In the House of Representatives, August 7,1841—On th« bill
to repeal the Sub-Treasury, and io reply to Mr J. THOMtSQif
Mason
Mr PE4.RCE said that he was not m the city oa Tuesday
last, when his colleague [Mr Mason] addressed the House
upon the subject of the Fiscal Bank But he saw by the report
of his colleague's remarks in the Intelligencer that he baa ha-
zarded the assertion that on this eubject Maryland was misre-
presented here by a portion of her delegation, and he learned
that his colleague had particularly mentioned him. Mr P.
said he should not plead to the jurisdiction, though he certainly
had been surprised to find tha^ there was any thing peculiar in
the position of his colleague here which authorized him to
assume a sort of censorship over the other members from his
State He was not aware of any íelation between Mr Mason
and his (Mr. Pierce's) constituent  which entitled htm to pro-
nounce for them the condemnation of their Representative I
ha 4 supposed (said Mr P ) that my colleague and myself were
equals on this floor, that we represented distinct and indepen-
dent constituencies, that each of us was capable of knowisg,
was presumed to know,und did, in fact, best know for himself,
what were the wishes of his constituents, what his obligations
to them generally, and on this pa acular eubject, required of
him In all this it beems that I was in error My colleague
has not only the happiness of possessing the confidence oíais
own constituents, but the advaDtage of a more intimate ac-
quaintance with the opinions and wishes of other districts than
then immediate Representatives It is therefore, with great
diffidence that I venture to do what he bids me not— to " corns
between the dragos and his .vrath " I am not charged, sir,
with the expression of any ¡sentiments at home otherthan those
which I avow heie, or with the concealment of my opinions.
But my colleague says that I was not elected to Congress m
1839, when this subject was the only quebiion before the nation,
and he takes this to be conclusive evidence not only that the
ppople of my district then were, but that they still are, id favor
of the Sub Treasury plan Of thatelection I will content my-
self with sa> nig that the ¡sub Treasury question was not the only
one which influenced the sumages of the people and that dur-
ing a considerable part of the canvass I was confined to my bed
by severe sickness But if an election is to be considered the
evidence of public sentiment the latest must surely be the best,
particularly when time has been afforded for the trial of the
measure which is said to be the test Now, sir, at the late elec-
tion I had no opponent at all Yet there ar*1, among the Oppo-
sition m my district, manygent'emenof honorable ambition,who
possess amp'e political intelligence and rhetorical ability My
colleague s party, therefore, had all the sinews of war—the men
and the measures, the cause and the champions There was a
question pending which they considered vital not only to the wel-
lare, but evuuo the liberties of the countrv, for so far have they
gone in their zealous exaggeration of the merits of the Sub Trea-
sury I was known to be hostile to the measure My cot-
leasue says the majority m (he district were decidedly for it;
and yet they surrendered the election to me without a struggle.
They abandoned this vital question without even beginning
the contest They gave up a victory which, according to him,
they only wanted the will to achieve They did not pven en-
camp upon the battle ground I saw not the sheen of their ar-
mor, nor the white gleaming of their tents They did not even
shut themselves m some stronghold, hang out their banner on
the outward wall anddefy me to theseige, but they surrender
ed their citadel, Sub Tieasmy and all, without waiting for my
summons to surrender I could not say, with Caesar, reñí,
vidi, vicit becaus , though I camp and looked, t saw no oneia
arms—nobody to conquer Now «ir would you suppose from
all this that I came here representing a minority of the district;
or would you not rather say thatthe pauy had shrunk from
the conte&t in conscious weakness?
[Mr   Mason here sad that his party had not shrunk from
the contest j
Si, I say that my colleague is mistaken, and that his party
did shrink from the content It is true that a portion of the dis-
trict did nominate as my opponent the gentleman who preceded
me here and who is favorably known to many of the members
of the House That gentleman declined the canvass, and,
among oiher things in a card which he published at the time,
he said that he had consumed many of his political friends,
and that ihey had unanimously advised him to decline the no«
mmation, bemuse his b^mg a candidate would not only he of riS>
service to the party, bu be absolutely detrimfental to it I
mention this not as evidence of timidity on the part of the no-
minee, but to show that his paity apprehended a certain de*
feat But my colleague t-a>s they feared General Harmon's
popularity Why, sir, General Harrison was dead and gone
befóte my nonnndiion, and how could ihey fear the popularity
ot him who had so often been stigmatized and denounced by
the party pie^, bv their political declaimersevery where, and
even fiom this Hou^e, as a bUck cork^de Federalist when
Federalism wa& in power, and a flaming Democrat when power
chansed hand> as a seller of white men into slavery, an Abo-
Imcm t, a miserable imlecile drivel er, aca&edshow, askulk-
ng cowdid, a pettcoat gceneial, who had neither vigor of
rr-md nor competence of knowledge, whose ignorance led hie
tioop^mto danger which he had not the courage to share;
who iud so little sense of honor as to claim and wear the lau-
re's which another had won and so little patriotism astode'
sp b the service of Iih country at the momet t of that country's
greatest need'                              ,,„ ,,
Were tht*e charges true or false? If they were true, how
od ous and abominable must have been Mr Van Buren's mea-
sures that all these iniquities of General Harrison sigwld ba
lighter in the scale Iffal-e, howweak the cause which?*
qmredtobebe aided an 1 ^propped up by calumnies suchas
these* Sir, the verdict of the people has settled these questions,
and the illustrious man, who was the theme of so much abuse
before death, has left a reputation for benevolence and honor,
and courage and patriotism, which is unsullied by a single stain,
and which history will forever preserve m the same record
with his eminent public service?
