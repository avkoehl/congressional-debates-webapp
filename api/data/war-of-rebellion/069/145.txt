Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy have fallen back from North Anna; we are in pursuit. Negroes who have come in state that Lee is falling back to Richmond. If this is the case, Butler's forces will all be wanted where they are. Notifity him to hold Smith in readiness to be moved, but to await further orders. I will probably know to-day if the enemy intends standing behind South Anna.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, May 24, 1864-8.20 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

In the Field:

When I received your telegram of 8 a. m. yesterday, * I had pared orders to General Smith to join you with 20,000 men. General Butler is now ordered to hold him in readiness to move. I wish everything was away from the south side of the James and with you. It would be much better. I do not like these divided commanders, with the enemy intervening. I would rather use them altogether under your own eye.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
