would not credit the documents of their own of-

Mississippi says that of all these cases alluded to
m that report, there were but nineteen fraudulent
cases, and that out of them, the district attorney
from whom the information had been dertved had
five Mr C said he should like to know win the
agent was thai had been sent to investigate Might
he not, on the other hand, been interested in =ome
■ten or fifteen cases out of the nineteen? The
fact was, that the whole pre- mption system putre-
fied and corrupted all it touched Mr C ailuded
to the Miami reserve, lands worth from ¿10 to §10
per acre had been intruded upon by latlAmm,

As well might they seize upon the dollars in the
pubhc Treasury, on the Join, arsenals, and p iblic

an Indiana paper a debate m relation to this rt-
s"rve, where the system of pie-emption was inves-

these matters in Kentucky , and of all the numeious
pre-emp iomsts who had lived in that State, he
knew of but one sngle individual who had re

to call the attention of the Senate to the documen-
tary tacts, and especially that of the Senator from
Kentucky, to the asseition that the lands would sell
for more at public auction than they biought under
the pre emption laws If gentlemen would look At
the documents on their tables, they would find tint
in 1822 the sa'es amounted to hat three cents more
than the minimum price, that in 1823 the excess
was only five cenl>, and in 1824 the excess was
only two cents JMow Mr C asked wne there
airy pre-emption lass in those years? No At
that time no general preemption law h,ule/ir

we find (said Mr C ) a falling off greater
than before, for in 1828 lhe excess was only
one cent, and in 1839 the same He hoped the
Government was honestly administered in 1S28
The Senator from Kentucky himself would be
able to answer on th it score,* and yet it was found
that in those vcars the average excess wasonlj one

assumption that the pie-emption laws had dimi-

Mr C said the auction system, instead of pre-
emptions, had been prolific of fiauds, which the
Senator from Kentucky might well have denounc-
ed as "scandalous to Government and to indivi-
duals " Such epithets would be much more appro-
priate to the combinations, who attended auction
«ale«, and bought land merelj foi speculation,
and not for settlement or cultivation If the Sc-
nater were to sre a large combination of capitalists
in attendance upon an auction land sale, holding
then immense c ipilal in terror ovei the seltler, at
one time demanding of him a certain sum per
