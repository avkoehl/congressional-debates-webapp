WASHINGTON, D. C., January 16, 1865-12.30 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

There are no accommodations whatever for additional troops at Annapolis, and if General Schofield's corps is to stop there any time they must suffer greatly in this weather. Here and at Alexandria we can give shelter to all without additional expense. I would therefore suggest that they be brought here till transports are ready for them either at Annapolis or Alexandria.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

CITY POINT, VA., January 16, 1865-3.30 p.m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff, Washington:

Annapolis was named as the destination of Schofield's corps for the reason that it was most favorable for embarkation, and it was supposed that by time it reached there present operations would develop the point most important to send it. IF you deem it best, however, you may change its destination to Alexandria.

U. S. GRANT,
