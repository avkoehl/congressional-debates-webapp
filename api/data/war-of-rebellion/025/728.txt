Lieutenant General J. C. PEMBERTON:

It is advisable that you should come here as soon as possible. Events are gathering near. You cannot be here too soon to prepare for action under whatever policy you may see fit to adopt. If you cannot come at once will you inform me if you desire that I should resist the occupation and fortifying of La Grange Junction? It is probable this will be done by the enemy in a few days, unless I resist it. The enemy in West Tennessee is about 45,000 strong, and re-enforcements daily arriving. You had better get some of Holmes' troops, if you would save Mississippi.
