land and move on Price. Saint John would be a good point to reach for that purpose, but I think it doubtful if anything is to be gained by moving to-morrow farther than Union.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

The movements of Merrill can be directed by you in accordance with your suggestion, if you think best.

FRANKLIN, October 5, 1864-8.10 a. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

General Pike has arrived here with about twenty-five rounds of ammunition to the man and baggage enough for 100,000 men. Please order forward by special train to Gray's Summit 100 boxes caliber .58 for General Pike. Let it be here by 12 m., if possible.

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 5, 1864-11.50 a. m.

Major-General SMITH,

Franklin:

The general commanding has just heard of the arrival at Cape Girardeau of Major-General Mower, and he desires you to hold on.

FRANK S. BOND,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

FRANKLIN, October 5, 1864-1 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I am happy to learn that Mower is in the vicinity. Send him forward as rapidly as possible; then send me 100 coffee-mills, large, capable of grinding parched corn. I can take my two old divisions and follow Price as long as there is anything to eat, and dispense with all transportation except enough to carry our ammunition. We must depend on the country for fresh meat and supplies after the retreat is commenced.

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General.

FRANKLIN, October 5, 1864-1.30 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Have you any pontoon-boats in Saint Louis, and proper wagons to convey them? I hope you can send us some india-rubber boats, as they require but little transportation. The Enrolled Missouri Militia that have reported to me won't stand marching as old troops.

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General.
