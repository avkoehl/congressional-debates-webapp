unprotected and give the enemy an opportunity to fall on your rear or on General Wise, or they may choose to rush forward to the railroad at Millborough and destroy and retreat through Alleghany and Greenbrier. These counties are so drained of men that there is no trouble to retreat through them and Nicholas, Braxton, &amp;c., back to Upshur.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. SKEEN,

Attorney for Commonwealth.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Manassas Junction, July 19, 1861.

After midnight to-night the red flannel scarf badge will hereafter be worn as a cravat or neck scarf by all to whom it has been issured. The enemy has resorted to this dabge and to-day is wearing it round the left arm. Nevertheless it is enjoined on brigade, regimental, and company commanders to impress on the men the necessity for the greatest circumspection and self-command, so as to avoid firing on frieds wearing the armed badge by mistake, or from ignorance of this change. Certainty should be sought for by all possible precautions before firing is begun.

By command of Brigadier-General Beauregard:

THOMAS JORDAN,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Watchword for the 20th July, 1861, "Our homes."
