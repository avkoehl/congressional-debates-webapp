remains, to be, paid, on two contiacts alone of

those Tvho ate actually in Congiess, but others
who have not been membeis for many years past
Shonl 1 such expendía íes be continued, this will
■very soon become an impoitant item, and m
any event a large amount will t>till be rcqumd to
fulfill contiacts foi books in no minner belong-
ing to the legitimate contingencies of eithei House
of Congiess
The expendituies of the Executive  depait
ments were, in the ten yeais aftei specific appro
pnations weie   made, about §195,000 annually,
the appiopnation foi 1838 was $795,000     Tins
item has  steadily incieased with the giowth of
oui  countiyand  it-, various establishments, le
quning executive agency and supeiintendence
Something would pi ibably be sued if theie weie
one contingent fund undirthe contiolof the Sec
letaiy foi all the offices of each depaument    Our
complicated system of accounts, ton, was estab-
lished many yi irs ago, and a moie judicious or
gamzation of the Dcpaitments might intioduce
greatei simplicity and economy      It is impossi
ble, however, to avoid a uniform incirase in this
blanch oí the public expcndituie, while we con
tinue  to multirly  oni   laws  at eveiy  session,
which must be cimed into effect by the Execu-
tive Departments, and while wciapidly increase,
as we hive  done of late, the number of lesolu
tions in both Houses, calling foi information,and
ftequentiy involving gieat Hboi and expense
Connected also with the Executive Depaitments
aie vauous expendituies whuh were veiy incon
sideiabk , oi did not exist at all, at the commence
ment of the Government—such as those foi the
Mint, Tcmtonal govetnm nts,the coast survey,
arming and equipping mill ia, the public lands,
and public buildings These, which in caily le
gislition were quite unimportant, now amount to
neai a million annually
The expenses of the Judiciaiy in the fiist ten
years aftei specific appropriations weie made, did
not amount to moie than about §61,000 annually,
the appropriation foi 1838 was $484,000 The
increased expense foi the salaries of judges has
not been beyond what might have been antici-
pated Iho expense, howevei, of the courts of
the United States has increased fiom about $30,000
to $342,000, which is the estimate foi the piesent
yeai In this branch of the public service, íe-
foim seems to be lequued While the clerks of
our comts aie appointed by the judges, and the
fees of the foimer amount to a much higei sum
annually than the salaues of the kttei,the ap
pointing power may be tempted to paitictpate in
the piofits of the clerkship, and to sanction the
most exoibitant charges The fees of our dis
ttict cleiks and attorneys ought to be more pie-
cisely legulated by law, and the clerks ought not
to be appointed by the judges
The expenses of oui mteicourse with foreign
Powers amounted m early years to about $50,000
annually, the estimate for the piesent yeai is
$266,484 'I his expenditme was consideiably
augmented by the revolutions in what was for-
meily denominated Spanish America The esti-
mate for the piesent year is not, however, so great
astheexpenditurefoi 1829,which was $289,14007
The current expenses of the Indian deoait-
ment were ummpoitant and irregular in early
yeais, but all the expenditures in this bianch for
the fiist ten years amounted to less than $32,000
annually, the estimates for 1839 amount to
$866,960, including some appropriations not foi
curient expenses This inciease is owing almost
exclusively to annuities and stipulations under
treaties with the Indians entered into since 1789
Having no military establishment worthy of
notice at the origin of the Government, the ex
pendituies in this blanch of the pubhc seivice
have of couise incieased When it is consideied
that the settled aiea of the United States has in
creased, aecoiding to the calculations of a scien-
tific engineer, in the ratio of 210,575 in 1790, to
1,0'3,664 in 1839, some idea may be foimed of

we may well doubt, notwithstanding the recent
I  increase of the Army, whethei it will ultimately
be found adequate to  protect all our extensive
|   fiontieis
Although we have been more liberal in our na
val appiopuations, that establishment still bears
an uninpoitant rank in comparison with that of
eveiy other mantime nation The improvement
in steam navigVion, however, seems to promise
a levolution in the mode of conducting maritime
wai, which may icnaei this diiieience of lebs
importance as it íegards existing navies, and
may lequne new and consideiable expenditures
in this bianch of the public seivice, which will
be noticed hei eaftei
The appropn itions for roads in 1838 weie
$540,000 There was no such Federal expendi-
ture in early years
In the expenses for light houses there has been
I  a considerable inciease, especially within the last
I  two yeais     The annual amount expended in the
first ten years, including the maintenance of the
I establishment, was less than $35,000     For many
i yeais past it was less than $300,000 annually, but
in 1837 it was suddenly increased to $1,220,019,
' and included §,921,964 for new light houses, &c
¡ In 1838 the appiopuations amounted to $063,873
The estimate  meicly for maintaining the exist-
ing light houses  in  the yeai  1833 amounts  to
$394,000     The appropuations for new woiks of
I this kind weie authouzed without pioper exam-
inations, and much money has been wasted in
. I this hi inch of the service    Two yeais ago Con-
' giess directed such cxaminttions to be made be-
'  foie any new woik should be commenced     The
I   officeisieported in favor of suspending the appio-
.   pnations fot thirty one of the numbei of works
I  authouzed by the act of 1837     There is a laige
|  amount no wiemaining unexpended in this branch
i   of the service
The expenditures for fortifications weie irreg-
I ular in the fiist years but fiom 1789 to 1798 the
, annual avei ige was $108,000 The appropna
tions for 1838 amounted to $1,01.>,000, and the
estimates for 1839, $1,269,100 This pan of the
national defense is still in a vci y incomplete state
The improvement in steam batteries within a few
yeais past renders it, however, a question worthy
of inquiiy, whether it will not also produce an
entne revolution in the plan of harboi defense,
and whether it would not be most judicious for
the present to confine oui expenditures to the aim
ament of the fortifications we have finished, and
await the results of future experiments which v, ill
become necessary to ascertain whethei floating
steam battcnes aie notsupenor to stationary foi
tifications in guarding the entrance into and in
defending haibois Theie are other leasons foi
suspending new appiopuations for 1839 Ihose
existing were not made until the 7th July last,
and the act directed that one half of the amount
should be expended in the present yeai and there
remained undrawn fiom the Treasury on the 1st
of January, $,704,369 56, besides the balances in
the hands of oui disbuisingofliceis Undersuch
Í encumstances, withadcficient revenue, and while
there is a piobability that a change will be made
in the plan of haibor defense, and that the public
' money may hereafter be more advantageously
expended, the committee are of opinion that it is
not expedient to add $1,269,100 to the laige amount
unexpended and in the hands of disbuising oil!
cers
For the first six and twenty years, the average
amount paid annually ior pensions was less than
eighty four thousand dollars    As late as 1814, it
was about ninety thousand dollars, and in 1815,
less than seventy thousand dollars   The late war
'   added about two bundled thousand for invalids
and the widows oi children of those who had
,   died of wounds received in battle     The whole
1 pension roll of the United States, aiising fiom the
I íevolutionary, Indian and British wars, did not
then exceed thiee bundled thousand dolíais an-
nually     The appropriations foi the present year
amount to «,2,500,000   to which are to be addtd
the pelmanentapproptiation of;>1,000,0Ü0, and un
expended appiopuations amounting to $741,000
making an  aggiegate foi pensions m  1839, of
$4,241,000, and we have now charged upon the
public Treasury foity two thousand five hundred
Ho. of Reps.
pensioners A bill was passed at the last session,
without debate, and approved on the last day of
1 the session, which diawsfiom the Treasury, in
the piesent year, $1,372,000, and there are three
general pension bills now pending in the House,
which would, if adopted, probably double the
annual amount appropriated for pensions
This result, and in soshoit a period, could not
have been anticipated by the framers of oui Con-
stitution The claims of our levolutionaiy sol-
diers rested on peculiar grounds Their services
and sufferings were of an extraordinary chaiac-
tcr, and we had from necessity been compelled to
i violate our contracts with them In their case
I we were warranted in departing from ordinal y
I usage when our means were ample to indemnify
| them Pensions to invalids, and to the widows
or children of those who are killed or who die
I of wounds received in battle, form a part of the
contract, where such laws exist, between the
Goveinmentand the soldier, but in granting pen-
sions as we have done, in cases where the sol-
dier was neithei killed nor wounded in battle,
we violated the pension punciple, and charged
the public Treasury with half pay to the repre-
sentatives of all who enlist m the service of Gov-
ernment, whether m peace or m wai, in addition
to the compensation stipulated for their seiviees.
Prior to 1836 there was no departure from the
ordinary pension rules, except as torevotutionaiy
soldiers, but in that yeai provision was made
generally foi pensions in oidinary cases of death,
while in the service, after the 20th of April, 1818,
whethei of wounds oi not * The same i ule was
extended to the Navy pension fund, which will
be very soon destioyed by such improvident le-
gislation Prior to 1837, this fund was amply
sufficient to provide foi our naval invalids, and
for the widows or children of those who had
been killed m battle It was invested in stocks,
and amounted, on the 1st March, 1837, to the
sum of ^1,115,230 53, it is now reduced, under
the opeiation of recent laws, to $293,363 09
Should we have no reform m this branch of legis-
lation, it will be difficult to anticipate the amount
which may be annually required for this expend-
iture If we continue to giant pensions m cases
of ordinary death, in peace or in war, to the
representatives of those who are employed m the
military service, and to all in the naval service,
we shall soon follow the example of some mon-
archies, and extend our pension roll, and with
equal justice, to the repiesentativesof all who die
in the civil employments of Government
The committee feci it to be then duty to bring
to the special notice of the House the heavy and
rapidly increasing expendituies upon harboi sand
nvcis Thi& item was unknown in the early le-
gislation of the Federal Government The first
appropriation was made in 1802 but prior to 1816
only $36,449 had been expended upon tw o woiks,
connected ducctly and indirectly, with navy-
yaids and light houses In 1816 and 1819 two
othei appiopnations weie made amounting to
$34,000, both connected with light houses A few
anpiopuations weie made in 1*20,1821,1822,and
1823, in the neighborhood of light houses and
navy yards, amounting altogether to $51,750, and
in 1823 two haiboi surveys weie authouzed, at
an expense of $350
After ve had adopted the policy of laismg more
levenut than was requued for Federal purposes,
and as the period appioachcd for the redemption
of the  public debt,  this was  one of the  new
blanches of expenditure resorted to in order to
I absorb a contemplated s>uiplus   Accordingly, and
i for the first time in the history of our legislation,
I   an act was passed on the 20th of May, 1826, "for
improving certain haibois, and the navigation of
I  ceitam uveis and creeks, and for authorizing sui-
'  veys to be made of ceitam bays, sounds, and
i  rivers, therein mentioned " On the 2d of March,
1827, this was followed by a regular annual bill,
"to authorize the improving of ceitam haibors,
!   the buildn g of piers, and foi other purposes "
These expenditures immediately increased,  in
