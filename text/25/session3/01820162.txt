IN SENATE
Tub-sday, February 5,1839.
A number of bills fiom the House of Repre-
sentatives weie read twice, and íeferred to the
appiopnate committees
The VICE PRESIDENT presented a commu-
nication from the Secretary of War transmitting
ageneial return of the mihtiaof the United States
Mi WALL presented the ciedentials of Hon
S\MtTEL L Southard, elected by the Legislature
of New Jersey a Senator from that State for six

lead
PETITIONS, ETC.
Mi PIERCE presented the memorial of Colonel
Many and others, officers of the line of the At my,
stationed at Foit Jesup
Mi P said, befoie taking the question on the
refeience, he dtsned to asktoi this memoiial the
caily consideration of tho committee to which it
would be appiopilately icfentd, and, foi a few
minutes, the attention of the Senate at this time
The memoiial refeiied to a subject which was
discussed to some extent heie at the last session,
and on which he believed theie was, at th it time,
lutidlv a difTeience of opinion, namely, the illative
pay of the office!s of the line of the Army and
the staff The Auny bill ot th last session, so
calkd, did not attiiet th< attention of Senatois
gt nerally until a \eiy hte period o< its piojiess,
and you will ic.nu.mbei, su, undci what encum-
stancts the little discussion which it had here
took place, it w is at a stage when it could not
be amended , it must be taken as a whole, as it
was ntcsented, 01 be lo-H
lie thought ho was w in anted in saying that it
owed its passage to these cncumstanccs the tin-
ep.uet state along the whole line of your fiontier—
eastern, noitiicin, and southern—the supposed
host le disposition of the Indians west of the Mis-
sissippi—and the fat t that it included among its
piovisions one tor the increase of the admitted
incompt tent and insufficient force of the rank and
file of the auny of foui thousand five hundíed
mi n borne of the piovisions of that bill, it is
iiotouous, found no favoi in this Senate, but,
stiong as weic the objection* to the bill, some of
whit h hi attempt! d at that time to state, he had
no disposition to notict now any except the one
paitKulnrly alluded to in the memorial It was
known to tho Sen tte, but it might not bt genet-
ally known that a colonel in the staff, stauoned
ptimuuntly in this city, leceued twtntyfive
doll irs pel month moie than an oflicei ot the same
gtadt , ( xposetl, not only to all the dangus and
haitUhips of the fold, but to the extia expenses
m idtnt to fuqiitnt changes of station and ser
vite I he san  dispaiity was tiuo of the lieuten
nut eoloiu Is, anil still more with ltgard to captains
The young oflieers who have been promoted to
tins tank in the staff itcuvt t!inty-fnc dolíais
peí month, ¡>-UOpu ytai, moiethan the veteians
in the lint , out of whom, at least, up to the lat>t
stssion of Congiiss, had scivcd, and with the
higlnst ciulil as vn ottioei, since 1808, said at
that time to be the oldt st captain in tht woild
How this might bt ho knew not, but then weie
i multitude of ol 1 and memonous o'uecis in th it
gi idt, ofheeis who hud done sufficient st nice to
waiiant them m piottsting against this unjust
distinction in fivoi of those who wt i in tht ir
childhood when they weie fighting the butles of
thin eountiy, dining the 1 tte war with Gieat
lintain
His main objt et in saying a woid on the pie-
sentation of the memoiial, was to til ice it m a
tine light, and to o ih the attention ot tht Senate
to its honoi ible tone and spiut The ofFiceis. of
the line of the Aimy wue not heie begging for
an inciense of pay, they prefenid no claim" but
lespectlully asked what wis íespectively and sub-
stuUiilly light He could not so peifectly do
justice to them, as by leading fiom then memo

It is the distinction, the invidious and unjust
distinction, of which the officers of the line com-
plain, not the amount of compensation No, su,
although they have stood on the same footing in
relation to pay since 1791, (rations only except-
ed,) while you have mcieascd the pay of tlw
Navy, of the clerks in your different bureaus, of
the staff, and indeed, 1 believe, of all your officeis,
with this single exception, they would probably
have remained silent but for this cause, which,
in my judgment, makes it their duty to address
you
One or two other paragraphs from their memo-
rial
" The operation of the act of the 5th of July last, has
been to give the officers of the staff corps a verv remark
able and unequal rate ot promotion and compensation,
when compared with that ot the officers of the line "
" If there were good reasons, growing out of then par-
ticular duties or stations, for the m irked difference in their
favoi we should rejoice that the liberality of the Govern
inent had been extended to them, hut the facts on those
points aie directly m opposition to the bounty which has
been bestowed "
They say a very remarkable and unequal rate
of promotion, as well as compensation, has been
bestowed upon the staff The probable tardiness
of promotion in the staff corps has sometimes
been uiged as a reason for additional pay—sin-
gulaily urged The statement of the memorial is
coirect The officers in the staff department have,
by the vei y operation of the bill of the last ses-
sion, obtained: more piomotion than they would
piobably ha\e obtained in the line of the Army
if they had remained theie till they weie sixty
ycais old Am I not eonect' Let me give an
illustiation Thete was an officei promoted in
the staff, by the opeiatton of the bill of last ses-
sion, who is now a full colonel, with the rank of
bngadier eeneral, who was a lieutenant m 1818.
A mentorious and woithy officer, he believed;
but where would he have found Ins rank in the
line of the Army had he remained theie ' Cer-
tainly not higher than the grade of captain
So far as he was capable of judging, every
statement and deduction m this memoiial was lit—
eially coirect The complaints weie just, and!
desei ve our consideiation If you will not level
up, level down Theie can be no doubt that the
distinction, if any be made, should be in favorof
theoffieeisof the line, but all they ask is equality,
and this is demanded alike by every considera-
tion of justice and policy
The memorial was then íeferred to the Com-
mittee on Mihtai v Affairs
Mi SMITH, of Indiana, presented petitions,
numeiously signed by citizens of Steuben and
De Kalb counties, Indiana, and of Branch and
Hillsdale counties, Michigan, on the subject of
post roads
Mr S said, previous to making any disposi-
tion of the petitions, he desired to ask the chair-
man of the committee whether it was the intention
of the committee to act on the subject at the pres-
ent session ?
Mr ROBINSON said it was not The Depart-
ment was not in a condition to make any new
loutes at the piesent session
Mr SMITH said he would ask to lay the pe-
titions and plats upon the table, to be íeferred
and acted upon at the next session, which was
ordered
Mr BUCHANAN presented the petition of
MaiyE Shaw and executors of John E Shaw,
which was referred to the Committee on Naval
Allans.
