MORTON, August 4, 1863.

I have no notice of the dispatch from Richmond mentioned in your telegram of the 2nd, but will meet you in Montgomery at the time you may designate.

J. E. JOHNSTON.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Knoxville, August 4, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: In connection with my suggestion relation to the removal of the North Carolina and East Tennessee regiments from this locality I inclose a communication from Brigadier-General [J. W.] Frazer, covering a latter from North Carolina.

The country is in a state of very considerable excitement, and, notwithstanding all attempts of my subordinate officers in different localities to prevent it, the exodus of Union citizens to Kentucky continues. Some of the parties are pursued; some are overtaken an killed or captured, but lawless violence is on the increase. Fully half of the East Tennessee and North Carolina troops, from the mountain district, are not to be relieve upon. I repeat my request for their exchange for other troops, for, when removed from the temptations of desertion, they will make good soldiers.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. B. BUCKNER,

Major-General, Commanding.

[Endorsements.]

AUGUST 12, 1863.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL:

I suggested an exchange with General Johnston or General Bragg.

The worst or most restless men might be sent to the Tennessee regiments in General Lee's army, and then transferred to them. Propose this.

J. A. S. [SEDDON,]
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Knoxville, August 21, 1863.

Respectfully forwarded for information and orders of General Bragg.

S. B. BUCKNER,

Major-General, Commanding.
