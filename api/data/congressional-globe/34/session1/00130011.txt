1855.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
II
Mr. CAMPBELL, of Ohio. Mr. Glerk, I ask
the indulgence of the House until I can remove
one of the obstacles to our organization. The
country is looking on our proceedings with deep
anxiety, and every member is ready to acknowl-
edge the importance of a speedy organization.
We have now been voting five days; twenty-
• threc votes hare been taken. I find, through th«
partiality of friends, that I have received, in six
of those votes, a higher number than any other
candidate before the House; and in all the votes,
a greater number than any other candidate of the
opposition to the Administration. Yet, sir, it is
obvious to me that it is impossible for my friends
to succeed, unless I can perform one of three con-
ditions : to repudiate my well-known principles in
reference to slavery; my views on Americanism;
or, in some way directly, or indirectly, to make
pledges with" regard to the forming of committees
' which will amount to a sacrifice of my sclf-re-
spect, and make me, in my opinion, a fit object
for public contempt.
Under these circumstances, and feeling that the
interests of the country require an organization,
and regarding those interests as paramount to
every other consideration, I withdraw my name
from the canvass. And in taking my seat, I de-
sire to return to the friends who have shown so
much fidelity to me, my sincere gratitude, and
my thanks to my political opponents who have
given me evidences of their personal regard. My
name is withdrawn.
The House then proceeded to vote a twenty-
fourth time for Speaker, with the following re-
sult: Whole number of votes, 220; necessary to
a choice, 111; of which—
William A. Richardson received 74
