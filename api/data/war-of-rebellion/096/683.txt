The Secretary of War directs me to inform you that he has been waiting for some days for a report from you respecting the recent loss of a detachment off 10 men sent out on a scouting expedition from your command last week, but has not yet seen any report from you on the subject. The frequent disasters in your command have occasioned much regret in this Department, as indicating a want of vigilance and discipline which, if not speedily cured, may occasion greater misfortune. You will please report immediately respecting the loss of the detachment referred to.
