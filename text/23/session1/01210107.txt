1834.                                 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                                   107
fi st Par lament had beei called in the reign of I
Herry Imrd  by tne government of Leicester,
boiely to obtain grants of money     Then most
abso'Ute soveieigns had been compelled to econo
mize, because the/ knew that whea they wanted
money they must ask the Commons for it    The
very civil war whi"! , in n^rt, drove so many of j
their ancestois  to seek an asylum on this conti
nent, commenced   with a struggle  who  should
have the disposal c f the puolie trcasuie, and when
that war, towards its c ose, h^d biought one mon
arch (Charles the Tirsl) to the block, the country
maintained thei- money powers, which they did
not part with until ti e restoiat on of Challes the
Second     Then, indeed, they paitedwith it, ana
felt, in consequence, all the evils of ui iting the
purse and the swoid  for to the act c-nfernng 11 e
disposal of the public reverue n the lung foi hit,
much of the subseqient atroci' es cf Jeffries ai d
otners were to  be mainly attributed     If such a
doctrine was suffered to pievail in this country,
he saw nothing toprevei t any young orambit ous
President from becoming the absolute monaich r f
these United S ates, as he did not think any difT
cultycouiü be interposed to prevent -urh i design
being accomplished    Tl ere was little difiere ice
in the President s having the power, through his
Secretary, to put the money in his pock t at his .
own wi'l aid  pleasure, and  the  power ti hue t
band of armed mercenaries for such an o >j ct
Woull  he  be told, in answer to this, tha   the
Piesident could not take out the money or hm -
se'f >   True, I e could  no , out he had a powei
tantamount to it, namely, to turn out of office l.im
who should refuse to comply with his wishes
The ¡secretary denies the power of Congiess to
interfere, says that "it is a. bleach of the agree
ment made with the bank "   So that it would
follow, m any cas , Congress could not mteitere
He had not, m the foiegomg remark , the íe
motest idea 'o chaige  the Piesident with any
impropet design, believing th it, howevei 1 e m a
apprehended  the powers of the Executive in   ne
piesent case, if he nad any such views, he also hau
sufficient moral courage, under any circumitinees,
to assert them openly     He contended  that the
power conferred by the bank chartei had  l en
given to the Secretary as the offi"er ot Congress,
as Congress was not always in session, and there-
fore could not act upon any emergency ai is ng
which would  requne  instantaneous act'on, but
the Congiess had never divested themselves of I
their constitutional rights    They  had not tne
power to do so    The Secretary was, m fact, a
mere trustee, the Hous  had, in consequence of
the powers he now claimed, the novel circumstance '
of a trustee claiming a r g it to act contrary to the
wishes of the very parties by wnoia he had been
appointed and chosen to act as tiustee     And if
Ins construction was ca r td out, there could not
be any interference with him by any of the othei
branches of the Gote-nment     He thought the
deposites ought or right to be lodged in the Bank
of the United States, as a part of the contract for
which they paid a large bom s originally    Yet,
if the Secietaiy's construction wis coirect, he
could lemove them at will, bat this was such a
palpable breach of contract as he loped ne\er
could be tolerated  between individual and tndi
vidual     Nether should it be countenanced  be
tween the bank and the nation     The Secretary
had  also undertaken to instruct them on 'he law
by which the bank was incorporated—" mat it
was a law not warranted by the Constitution "
But what authou'y had he to decide such a ques
tion >
Mr M here referred to that passage in the
Secretary's report which alluded to the publ c
convenience as a proper motive for the lemoval of
the deposites Ihis, he contended, was an as
sumption of legisU ive powei by the Secretary
When Congress established the bank, they took
into view, fist, their constitutional autnoiuy .sec-
ond, tne commeicial in erests of the country , and
third.thecoi vemence of the Government Ihese
several consideiations iesult°d ¡n a legislative act
So, if Congres  should undeitake to remove the
public depositee from the bank to the State banks,
they would const ler the comme'cial advantages to
be derived from the removal, and the aoihty of the
State banks to promote the convenenre of the
trove'niient     The Seir taiy, from th  saint or
sulerations, arrived at the result tnat th  deposites
oug it to be removed to the S ate Lank , and pio
ceeds to effcet the removal    In wh"t par' cular,
then, does his decision fall short of a legislative
act>   It tvas an assumption by the Secre aiy of a
power to legislate    He rial ns to act on every
consideration which could have been brought be
fore Congress     Where did the S-'cretaiy get the
power to | lace the deposites in the State banks!
He would be thankful to any gentleman to inform
him     He did not ge' it from the bank charter
But he gets  it, he says, from  the  necessity of '
the  case      rlv   M   denied   he existence of the
authority, from whateversaurce it might be pre
te ded to be derived       We have a   Treasurer,
whose duty it was  to  keep the  pubh"  money
The Secietaiy migl t have left it in the ha'-ds of

He could rot see exactly with what propnety
the Secretary biought fotwaid such considera-
tions      Everybody knew that General Jackson j
would hate been elected if he had chartered foity
banks, and  his election was not decisive of the
opinions and wisnes of the peonle on the sulj ct
The Secretary objected to the bank that it had I
i icieased i s t iscounts    The proper wav to rem  |
edy this  would, he supposed,  be   to call  the
money  back again  into the bank    The bai k
did so, and the Secretary condemns the curtail-
ment     He complains of the curtailment as 0 3
press ve to the community    The Secietaiy also
undertakes to show that the bark acts as the fis
cal a0ent of the Government, and he g ts into an
aigument to show that the bink had been guilty
of such misconduct as justified the Goverra nt j
in withdrawing from it all confdence     Well, why
oíd  le not tnen take away the money at oí ce |
from the bank     But he Icates it there for some
time afterwards     Lither, therefore, his argument
was unsound, or he 1 ad nnpioperly left money in ¡
the bank                                                                       .
I     Weheai, said Mr  M , of pressure for money  |
The distress was great, even if it was but one tenth ;
| as great rs it was repiesented to be It was, in
his opinion, destined to bee imegreater We were
getting back to the penod of 18lA, when the coun
tiy was inardated with depreciated bank paper
The State of Ohio was about to establish a bank
with a cap tal of four or five millions Indiana
anothei, with el ven or twe've branches, and
Noith Carol na ha 1 established three new banks,
and was about to chartei a fourth In otherSlates
the sare e^nmei t was making The day was
not distan' v. I en we «mould ravees much dep eci
ated paper as we foimeilyhad He was not dis
posed to discuss tins question on party grounds
It ought not, he thought, to be look'datas a party
question He was aware that some editors had.
assumed the office of dictatois,and had instructed
the friends of he Administra ion to support the
course of the Adm .ustration in regard to the le-
moval of the deposites. But he denied their right
to instruct him in his duty Although he believed
that a national bank was necessary, and that the
State banks were unconstitutional, yet he was not
a fuend to the p"esent Bank of the United States
He was not satisfied with its conduct in lending
laige sums of money to editors upon insufficient
security, and there were facts al'eged by the Gov-
ernment dtiectors which must be explained before
ne would vote for the renewal of its charter, nor
was he inimical to the piesent Administration,
though he set up no claim to its friendship He
had come here m the hope that he might be able
to sustain the measu es of the Admimstrat on;
but he would rot degrade the body to which he be-
longed by doing an act which his conscience would
not justify He luil heard itsuggested ihatthough
the act of the lemoval mi0ht have been improper,
yet that it ought now to be sustained by the mends
of the Administration Now, he ha i always un-
deistoo I that justice ought to be done, even should
the heavens fall But the people of the United
S'ates were not disDosed to condemn a man or a
set of men on acciunt of any single error—nor
would he utterly condemn the Admimstrat on on
account of what he considered its errors On th s
subject It might be tiue that tne restoration of the
de os  s wou d defeat some of the arrangements
of the Sta'e banks Mi M then alluded to th
do" une of nullification, which he strongly con-
defined, though for many of the Null fieis he had
a strong pergonal regard But he would not sup-
po t an act which he believed to be wrong, merely
because it was supported by those who have on
some questions been wrong
Mr M here referred to some remaiks which
had fa'len from the member from New "i oik [Mi.
Cam3icleng] on the subject of State rights Mr
M was not, he said, exactly a State rights man,
though he admi'ted the States had rights, and he
wou d go fai to sustain them He was under ob-
ligations to the President for the defence of State
rights, in hio proclamation That document met
with his entne approbation The gentleman had
complimented Virginia on her principles, and on
having been always right He believed that she
was as apt to think right as any State, but still
she sometimes thought one way, and scnetimes
another She was, in his opinion, right now, in
condemning the removal of the deposites He had
now more reason to be proud of her than ever
She still acts on her high and honorable princi-
ples, and refuses to susta n an act which she
deems improper, though it is direcled against an
institution, to the estabhsnment of whicn she was
always opposed
Mi    BCAIIDSLEY, of New York, took the
floor, and on his motion,
