HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, Tenn., April 15, 1864.

General McPHERSON, Huntsville:

Your two dispatches received. Estimate for 250 to 300 cartridges in the boxes, wagons, and at Huntsville depot.

Forrest took Pillow, killing 50 whites and taking 100 prisoners; also 300 negroes were murdered after capture. I don't understand it, as the place was long since abandoned by my order. I think Forrest is trying to draw us off and to prevent our concentration; same of the cavalry to which Dodge alludes.

Tell Dodge to find some other name for Flint River south of the Tennessee, which misleads me in his reports. Of course I don't suppose the enemy has anything like 5,000 men about Decatur. It is a force to observe and watch your movements.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

PADUCAH, April 15, 1864.

General BRAYMAN:

A reliable gentleman has just come in from Maryfield; says Buford is there; that 2,000 rebels came from the south and met him there last night; that they say Forrest is at Obion, bridging to get his guns over; that they say they intend to take this place. Let them come; I am ready.
