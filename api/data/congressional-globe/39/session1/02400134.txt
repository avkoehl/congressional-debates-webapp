He also presented the petition of citizens of
Michigan, praying thai the soldiers who enlisted
in the scrvice of the United -States previous to
the year 1865 may receive an extra bounty
equal to the highest bounty paid in 186-5 : which
was referred to the Committee on Military
Affairs and the Militia.
He also presented the petition of Mrs.'Fran-
ces S. Eichar4Â®n, widow of the late Major
General I. B. Richardson, who was killed at
the battle of Antietam, praying for an increase
of her pension; which was referred to the Com-

He also presented apetition of citizens of the
State of Michigan, praying for an increase of

Mr. HOWARD. I present the memorial of
the Board of Trade of the city of Detroit, pray-
ing for an appropriation for the construction
of a breakwater at Marquette harbor in Lake
Superior. As it is a subject of mueli impor-
tance to the people of other States, as well as
to that State, I move that the memorial be
printed, and referred to the Committee on
Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. MORGAN presented the petition of
William Bell and John Ilughcs, praying for
the issuance of an American register for the
ship Patrick Henry; whieli was referred to the
Committee on Commerce.'
Mr. MORGAN". I present tho memorial of
the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New
York, praying for the passage of a law to ex-
empt northern creditors from the operation of
southern State statutes of limitation for a cer-
tain period. These memorialists represent that
at the outbreak of tho late civil war tho mer-
chants of the eity of New York held claims to
a large amount against citizens of the southern
States for money loaned, and for goods sold and
delivered, it is believed that the aggregate
amount of these claims did not at the date spe-
cified fall short of $150,000,000; that only a small
portionof theamounthas since been liquidated,
andalargeproportionoftheresiduehas been, or
soon will be, barred by tho operation of the stat-
utes of limitation. In the opinion of the memo-
rialists, statutes of limitation to suits on contracts
are reconcilable with justice only on the suppo-
sition that t he parties have had an opportunity to
enforce their claims through the usual courts of
law; and inasmuch as during the late civil war
it has been impossible for loyal creditors to take
measures to collect their debts in tho southern
States by any civil proceedings whatever, jus-
tice requires that all the period of the rebellion
should be excepted from the time fixed for the
limitations of actions in those States. Such is
"the substance of this memorial. It relates to a
matter of considerable importance, and I move
that it be referred to the Committee on the J u-
diciary. and printed.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. ANTIION Y presented a petition of non-
commissioned officers, musicians, and privates
who have been disabled in the service of the
United States, praying for an increase of pen-
sion ; "which was referred to the Committee on
Pensions.
He also presented the petition of H. Mary
Irish, widow of Henry T. Irish, and her chil-
dren, alleging that they have been loyal to the
Government of the United States, and praying
for compensation for property seized in the
State of Mississippi by troops under the com-
mand of Major General Steele: which was le-
ferred to the Committee on Claims.
Mr. IIOWB presented the petition of citizens
of Depere, Brown county, Wisconsin, praying
that ueperc may be made a port of entry;
which was referred to the Committee on Com-
merce.

Militia.
