ROME, GA., October 10, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have two pontoon bridges, one across the Etowah, leading south, and one across the Oostenaula, leading west. I use the one across the Oostenaula to pass my infantry and cavalry pickets and patrols. I will push my cavalry out WEST and feel for the enemy strong. Upon their return I will have the bridge taken up at midnight and move it up into town, unless you think otherwise and order to the contrary. Then I will destroy it at once. Further information by an escaped prisoner indicated that Hood is crossing the Coosa with his whole army. Hood's headquarters at present are at Cave Spring.

JOHN M. CORSE,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, Cartersville, October 10, 1864 - 4. 05 p. m.

General CORSE,Rome:

I am glad you have two bridges. Take up the one over the Oostenaula at the last moment of safety and keep it, for I will want to use it. Hood would have attacked you before this if he intended to, for he must know I am near you. His cavalry at the Pumpkin Vine knew we were marching through the Pass. Watch his movements close, and I think he will only throw a force toward Rome to cover his movement either cover toward the Tennessee or back to Georgia. Look out for our cavalry south of the Etowah at daylight. To get at Rome he must cross the Oostenaula again, and that will take him a whole day, and that gives me all the time I ask. I do not think he will attack Rome.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, Cartersville, October 10, 1864.

General CORSE,Rome:

I am moving my whole army to Kingston. The Ohio is passing here now and will be at Kingston early in the morning. Hold to Rome to the last, and prepare for hard work. If I can get at Hood I will attack him, but it looks as though he was moving toward Decatur.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

ROME, GA., October 10, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The cavalry I sent out last to reconnoiter on Cedartown road is just returning, having captured a picket about eight miles from here belonging to French's DIVISION, of Stewart's corps, having arrived at this camp near Cave Spring about 5 p. m. yesterday. Their destination he does not know; seems to them they are trying to cross the Coosa. He says Wheeler is supposed to have possession of Kingston, having moved in that direction during yesterday there is no doubt. Corroborative
