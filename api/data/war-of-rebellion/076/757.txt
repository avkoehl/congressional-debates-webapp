Major-General MILROY:

Wheeler is on the Murfreesborough pike, ten miles out. General Rousseau is fighting him with cavalry and infantry between here and Murfreesborough and if you have a force you can spare, he wishes [thinks] you had better send it up this way. General Rousseau is in command of the forces that are out.

At 1 p.m. General Rousseau was driving the enemy slowly near La Grange. You had better perhaps move your main force of cavalry up the road.

Nothing from General Rousseau later than 8 a.m. at which time he was fighting Wheeler's force, ten miles out on the Murfreesborough pike, and slowly driving him. The road is good south of Bell Buckle, Captain Baird, aide on General Milroy's staff, having just passed over it.
