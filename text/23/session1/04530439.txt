On motion ot Mr BIBB, all the ciders were
postponed, and the Senate pioceeded to the con-
sideration of the report of the select committee
relative to the election of
PRESIDENT   A1ND   VICE PRESIDENT.
The question be ng on the adoption of the
amendment reported by the select committee in
lieu of the resolution submitted by Mr Bibb at
the commencement of the session—
Mr LI BB said it was his desire to avoid dis
cussion upon the subject The session was far
advanced, and he thought the minds ot gentlemen
must be mude up in relation to it
Mr rORSYl H asked that the resolution and
amendment might be read, which was done
Mr LEIGH made a few observations in oppo-
sition to any consideration of this subject at this
time He thought the proposed amendment in
the system of choosing a President and Vice Presi-
dent would be productive of much more confusion
and inconvenience than the present Almost evai y
Slate in the Union had the vanity to think that
some one of us citizens was qualified foi the ofiice
of President of the United States, and the conse-
quence would be that each Slate would have its
candidate, and those of the laigest States would
invai lably have the best prospects of success He
thought the system of management which pre-
vailed to some extent, v/ould tall irto me hands
of the small politicians instead of the la ge ones,
if the amendment pievailed, and he piefe red us
being in the hands of the large politicians, if it must
exist at all He thought this subjec ot the most
magnitude and importance, and requiring delib
erate investigation and discussion, foi which there
was not sufficient time at the present session He
hoped it might bepeimitted to heon theiable,and
be brought forward eaily in the next session
Mr BIBB remaiked thai this subject, with a
view of preventing the election of a Piesident
fiom going into the House of Representatives, had
ao-itateJ. the country since 1616 It was now settled
that the machmeiy of eleetois was both useless
and cumbersome, preventing the eeparat on of the
question of President from that of Vice President
At piesent the e'ection of both was in the hinds of
the petty politicians of the counti y, and he thought
the pioposed system would place it n the hands
of tie people tl emielves He thought the oljec
tion that each State would have Us own candidate,
unde, the new system,ou-h to beabandoned He
anintted there weie many distinguished men in
the several Sta es who m ght ,e thought worthy
of eievauon to the Piesidency, but he had so much
respect for the opinions of the people, that be
believed they would perceive who weie the most
prominent candidates befoie .hem, and t at they
wou'U geneially choose fnm them Hn gieat
otiect ri pies«in<-this íesolution at this time was
tl (• ti e ríoposed erne id .l-nt m'bl t be acted o l
by the respective State Legislatures, and, if ap-
proved of by the requisite number, the amendment
might be made before the next presidential elec-
tion, and thus avoid any recurrence to the House
of Representatives to effect a choice at that time
Mr BENTON explained the proposition It
contained three points 1 Torefer the election
of President and Vice President to a direct vote of
the people 2 To take the election out of the
House of Representatives 3 To abolish the gen-
eral ticket system, and introduce a uniform system
of districts
He said that the theory of the Constitution had
failed wjth respect to the electors They were in-
tended to choose the Presidentand Vice President,
and to follbw their own will in the choice This
theory had failed Electors now had no choice
They were pledged to particular candidates, and
could not vote otheiwise without treachery to a
sacred trust They had become, therefore, a use-
less piece of machinery, which might do harm,
but could do no good In the election of Vice
President, these electors must sometimes obstruct
the will of a part of the people It would happen
in the case where two voters agreed about the
Pi esident, but disagt eed about the Vice President.
They must both vote for the same elector to
secure their choice for the first office, the elector
could only represent one of them in voting for the
secord office.
The two other principles, Mr B said, depended
upon one another They rested on compromise
The great States complained of the equal right of
the small ones m the House of Representatives,
and the small ones complained of thegeneral ticket
system, which enabled the majority m a great
Siate to pi ess tne minority into their service, and
make them vote against their choice, and thus
overwhelm the small States with masses, which
masses might contain many votes which would
be given to the candidate supported by the small
States, if the voters were free, under the dis-
trict system, to suppoit whom they pleased In
yielding to this compromise, each class of States j
gained an ebject deal to it, and parted withanghUi
more specious than valuable The right of the
. small ¿inies to vote in the House of Represent-
atives was an illusion In practice it belonged to
the representative, and not to the Slate, for the
State had no way to enfoice her will or to íecall
the vote of her repiesertative, if given contrary to
her will Thegeneral ticket system wasunfriendly
to the nghteof the people, it enabled the majority
to impiess the votes of the minority, and that
ought to condemn it in a country of equal rights
Mr B explained the nature of the proposition
to amend the Constitution He consideied it a
mere question of reference It was not for Con-
gress to decide upon the amendment, that was to
be done by the State Legislatures, and the vote of
Congiess merely referred the amendment to them
for then tdoption or rejection He thought that
members should not be ítluctant to make these
íeferences, seeing that they weie not laws binding
upon the people, but propositions for the people to
decide, and that all a membei had to decide was,
I whether he was willing that h s State should
decide upon the amendment for itself, he being one
of the people to make the decision himself at the
final question
Mi   B  explained the practical operation of the
amendment     It provided for a second election by
I the people if th- first failed     He presumed there
i would be frequently two elections, and that the
1 fist one would ope.ate as a nomination, and would
propose the real candidate foi the actual election
!  Thus the people were to meet in August and vote
for President and Vice Piesident     It no one had
a majority of the whole numbei, then a second
election would takep'ace m November or Decem-
ber be ween those Having the two highest num-
bers     Mi    B   said that the fiistor piehmioary
election would stand in place of the caucuses and
conventions now used foi nominating piesidential
candidates, and would supei ede those caucuses
and  conventions     It  would  enable  the people
i themselves to piopose the candidates—'o makethe
nominations—ind aftet wards nial e the election
I out of (hese nominations     In ars*er to the sug
gestions of the Senator Horn  "Vng'tna, ovei  tne
vay, [Mi   Leig.i.1 tnat the large States would
I always have ih  fo emost on the 1 s', All   B said
there would be danger of that consequence if the
general ticket system prevailed, but the amend-
ment proposed the d ¡strict system, and it would be
difficult for any eminent man to obtain the vote
of every district in his State.
Mr B was anxious for a vote upon the propo-
sition It was the oldest subject before the House,
for1 it stood No 1 on the Calendar It was an old,
subject before the people, and it was probable that
the public mind was now ready to decide it If
referred to the people now and adopted, it will be
in time for the next presidential election, and will
supersede the necessity for a caucus or a conven-
tion He thought the two Houses of Congress
could not open it at once and without formal de-
bate. Whoever was agreed to the principles might
concur in the details, for they had been well di-
gested. They were the work of two committees,
one an extraordinary committee of nine members,
from which it was first reported, the other, the
select committee of five members to which ¡t had
been referí ed by the order of the Senate, and which
had reexamined it, and had given the present
details the sanction of their approval Mr B
believed that the details ard the phraseology were
as perfect as could be made, and that every mem-
ber who was in favor of the principles, oi rather
every member who was willing to give his con-
stituents an opportunity of voting upon these prin-
ciples, might safely adopt it.
Mr TYLER was in favor of laying this subject
on the table Heprefeired the original pi oposi-
tion for which this substitute of the select com-
mittee was proposed as an amendment. He pre-
ferred it because this provided for dispensing with
the whole district system, and provided for the
exercise, in its fullest foice, in each State, of the
geneial ticket system This proposition,however,
divided the whole of the United States into dis-
tricts, it broke up all the boundary lines of the
States, and the consequence was, that we must
vote by distucts He concluded by moving to lay
the whole subject on the table, which was agreed
to
The VICE PRESIDENT presented a commu-
I nication from the Treasury Department, relative
