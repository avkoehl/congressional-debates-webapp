Montgomery, April 9, 1861.

His Excellency A. B. MOORE,

Montgomery, Ala.:

SIR: Replying to your note dated yesterday, I beg to say that this Government is prepared and anxious to receive all of the corn purchased for the State of Alabama which may be sound and merchantable, and the Department had supposed that this was understood by Your Excellency.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. P. WALKER.

CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

Montgomery, April 9, 1861.

His Excellency JOSEPH E. BROWN,

Milledgeville, Ga.:

SIR: Your letter of the 4th instant has not been answered earlier because of the extreme pressure on the Department growing out of the present crisis in public affairs. Your Excellency will, I am sure, appreciate the embarrassments which have surrounded this Department, in view of the many which must have impeded Your Excellency's administration of similar affairs for the State of Georgia. The rule of the Department requiring the troops for the Provisional Army derived from the several States to be mustered in at Pensacola was general, and has been complied with in respect to all the troops except only those whom Your Excellency requested to be mustered in at Macon. It was therefore impossible to abrogate the rule, for that would have given just cause of offense to the State which has already complied with it. Touching the objection suggested by Your Excellency, that under the rule referred to such of the men as should be rejected on inspection would be discharged at an inconvenient distance from their homes, I beg to say that I have no doubt but that this Government will defray the expense of transportation and necessary temporary subsistence in the case of such rejected men.

On the subject of the appointment of surgeons for the Georgia troops, I beg to say that this Department will endeavor, as far as possible, to make its action correspond with that of Your Excellency, and with that end in view I must request Your Excellency to transmit me a list of the surgeons and assistants for your troops; and with reference to the possibility that the Department may be unable to make acting assistant surgeons of all your appointees, you will oblige me by indicating the names you prefer to be retained and in the order of your preference. Your Excellency's understanding of the point at which the Georgia quota is to serve is correct.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. P. WALKER.

SAVANNAH, April 9, 1861. ALKER:

Have you called for more troops from Georgia? For what destination?

F. S. BARTOW.
