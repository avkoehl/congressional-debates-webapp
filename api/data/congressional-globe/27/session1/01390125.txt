when the country was de ph if \ bin, m^t aspe-
cially in respect to our c ns itut ondi cu'rency—a
man whose mind was impressed on the history,
not only of the Constitution itself, but on the hi -
tory of i s administration fiom the day of it-  adop-
.ioii to the present time
Mr A said that Mr Hamilton had paid great
attention to the projH; ard although he had not
had tune to examm*, it, he was well sati«fied that
if the House thought proper to refer and have the
draught printed, they might derive from it aseful
advice on the sub]ecf of th  currency
The SPEAKER said that the gentleman ceuld
enly make his motion by unanimous consent
And the motion to refer the projet to the Select
Commi ee m the Currency, and to print it, being
before the House—
Mr EVERETT should douV, he -a d, the pro-
priety of printing th s projet, after tne course
wh'ch had been t^ken by the House in another
very strong case which had been presen cd a few
days ago He would move the reference, without
the printing
Mr ADAMS said he did not himself consider
the decision of the House the other day, against
printing a projet of a similar character to this,
pre ented by a dibt nguiohed member of the House
itselt [ Tr Birmsd,] as final and decisive. He
(Mr A) tnousht tnat if the House had not acted
on tr-at motion mahuiry, but had ma'urely con-
sidered it, the printing of that projet would have
been agreed to He thought that the House should
order the printing of all these plans or projet , as
tfeey all tended to e uciJa'e the subjec to all the
members of this EU u e as well as to tae commu
nity abroad
Mr HTJjNT was opposed to priming this projet,
em the g'ound « hich bad been takui by the gentle-
man from Vermont [iVtr E\EKj¡"rT] \, ith the iddi-
ticnal argument that the paper referred to by that
gentleman came fiom one ot then own members,
who staled that he had bestowed much time and
considc-at on upon the subject He (Mr H ) for
one, af er thet dccisio-i, and whilst it re-named un
r«v°rse , would oppose the printing ot any projet,
coming ei be- from a member of this House, or, as
in the present ca=e, from a pei«on not ho'dmg a
seat on his floor
Mr BARNARD said hehoredtbat no serious
object on would be made to the print!"", and he
hoped ihe IIo„se woul i «ettle the question without
re'erence o a íy decís on tual might have been
made oí Pn i obted case that I od be°n passed

Messrs KENNEDY, WHITE, and THOMP-
SON, of Indiana
[Mr Kennedy presented several petitions
signed by citizens of Jay county, Indiana, praying
Congress to charter a National Bank, and express-
ing it as the opinion of the petitioners, that such an
msutuuon would restore the coun ry to a state of
healthful action.
These petitions (said Mr. K ) come from my dis-
trict, and are signed by a portion of my immediate
constituents This being the case, it is due to
them, as well a¡, to myself, to state that upon this
question, the petitioners and myself differ tn toto.
At Ihe bcitom of these petitions (said Mr K.) there
is a written request that I would present them, and
vote for a bill to carry out their praytr The first
brand of thp request I now comply with, and I do
so wi h great pleasure but lo comply with the se-
cond branco of the lequest, I beg leave respectfully
to decline, for I shall assuredly vote against the es-
t'blishmcntof a National Bank of any description,
beluv ng asido that u would be both inexpedient
and urconstitutiona! ]
