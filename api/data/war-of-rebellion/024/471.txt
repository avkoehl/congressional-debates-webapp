LA GRANGE, TENN., November 24, 1862-9 a.m.

Memphis has 18,252 men for duty. Being well fortified, 16,000 can be spared. From other portions of department troops cannot be spared, except to move south on their present lines. I have contemplated an attack upon Pemberton and given my orders accordingly. Sherman will move on Wednesday and form junction with many forces south of Holly Springs on Sunday next. Steele has been written to to threaten Grenada, and Commodore Porter has sent some gunboats to operate about the mouth of Yazoo. Must I countermand the orders for this movement? It is too late to reach Sherman or Steele before they will have moved. Within the department I have 72,000 men.

Our cavalry are now crossing Tallahatchie. Infantry will follow immediately. The rebels are evidently retreating. If so, I will follow to Oxford. Our troops will be in Abbeville to-morrow, or a battle will be fought. Sherman is up and will cross the Tallahatchie at Wyatt.
