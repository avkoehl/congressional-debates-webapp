of 30 feet along east half of gorge; this occurs over second and third rooms east of south port. The rubbish all along accumulated favorably, and if supplied nightly with sand in bags half full, I can, perhaps, save the arches yet. West half of gorge is all right; so is magazine. No fire directed to-day on that side.

SUMTER, August 23, 1863.

MAJOR: The monitors engaged fort 3.15 to 5.30, firing on line pan coupe and magazine time fuse and rifled shell; 4 hit in vicinity of upper magazine, 1 sending particle of shell into ordnance store, second tier, and north of magazine; another bursting up in King's mess-room, sending sand from bags below into magazine; third struck near and west of ventilator. No damage of consequence done by any of them. Fog stopped the firing half hour ago. Sullivan's Island and Battery Simkins opened. Monitors fired thirty to forty times.

SUMTER, August 23, 1863.

MAJOR: Northwest front has now five arches with ramparts fallen in. Northeast barbette battery unserviceable. East front scarp all much scaled by slant fire, with large craters under traverses; principal injury at level of arches and terre-plein.

Sourthern two-thirds of wall east magazine damaged; to main outer wall, trifling.

Stone revetment protected by rubbish and previously unhurt. Gorge not materially damaged since yesterday.

Another shot penetrated above sand filling of second-story rooms, making three since attack began. East barbette battery parapet much loosened and undermined, though not displaced; 11-inch gun and one 10-inch gun untouched.

Brooke gun carriage shattered, one 10-inch trunnion gone, one 10-inch gun chasis rail shattered, another elevating screw broken; this last is to be repaired to-night.

The Brooke gun could be easily mounted on a 10-inch carriage, but it will not be done; excuse is, blocks have been sent away, and no blacksmith shop. I know it is practicable without these. If not mounted, there will be only three guns to fight in east battery and two in casemate second-tier salient. No fire to-night. No casualty to-day.
