employ him on some board or court. He is a shrewd, energetic man, might be used advantageously on Crittenden and McCook court. Thomas has been much embarrassed by Stanley, who gets drunk and is lazy and careless. Still, he is a major-general assigned to this department by the Administration, and Thomas has not felt himself at liberty to order him away. Accordingly, he has very reluctantly appointed him to command a division. Can I tell Thomas that he must follow his own judgment in such cases?

Bragg sent Grant a flag this afternoon, warning non-combatants to leave Chattanooga. It having proved impossible to get up Sherman's troops, movements intended to-morrow postponed.

This rise will now occur, when our bridges will be in danger from flood as well as torpedoes.

Dodge is ordered to proceed with all dispatch opening road, and Colonel Pride, formerly serving with Grant on West Tennessee railroads and before Vicksburg, has been sent for to take direction of work. Quartermaster-General returned here last night from week's stay at Bridgeport.
