Colonel W. F. GEIGER,

Immediately upon receipt of this order you will commence moving your troops to the Cadron Ferry, thence to be embarked by boats to this place. Answer and let me know when they are likely to reach the Cadron.

LITTLE ROCK, May 28, 1864.

Colonel A. H. RYAN,

Cadron Ferry:

Communicate the following to Colonel Geiger: "Move as soon as you can get ready to our to the line of the Little Red, between Kinderhook and Searcy. Your mission is to watch that line and intercept messengers from Childress. If he comes back draw him in toward yourself. Communicate to this point from the Little Red daily, either by the way of Cadron or Brownsville. Four companies are out from Devall's Bluff to Searcy; if necessary you can use them should the enemy be in your vicinity."

Give Colonel Graves the following directions from me: "Put the sick and men least able to march, with my horses and Lieutenant Litherland's, on the steamer Alamo, and send her to Little Rock. With your infantry and artillery march down the north side of the river to the point. You are more likely to be wanted here than anywhere else."

(For Colonel Ryan:) With your Third Arkansas you will guard Cadron Ferry and scout to Lewisburg, and give me timely information of any additional force of the enemy crossing the Arkansas. I will send Colonel Fuller, with all your men, back to-morrow. Telegraph me to-morrow morning whether all these directions are clearly understood.

Send Colonel Ryan's cavalry to Cadron Ferry, with orders to scout to Lewisburg. Send Captain Hesser immediately to Cadron Ferry; direct him to provide you with the rations above named, and Colonel
