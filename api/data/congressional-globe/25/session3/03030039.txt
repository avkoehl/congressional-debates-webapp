got, and we have not He says that if we vote
this boon to New Yoik, he will hereafter vote
something of the kind for others. If we will vote
for New York, then he will vote for the South.
But, sir, the claims of the South rest on no such
bargain, they depend not on wfiat price shall be
paid, but on what has been paid already, and the
way for us to get oui rights is to keep any more
from being given to New York, and to the North,
until we get them
Mr WISE. I want to get clear of this bill,
and if this debate goes on any further, I shall move
to lay it on the table A word only in reply to
the gentleman from Georgia who has just resumed
his seat. I will answer his question, why we
cannot get a navy-yard and dry-dock at the South.
He asked whether it was for the want of talent >
1 will tell him it is for the want of that soit of talent
which is required to get boons out of this Govern-
ment. There is not aman in ail the southein
delegation on this floor that has the sort of talent
for that business It is not owing to any want of
disposition on the part of the House, nor on that
of the Committee on Naval Aftairs, that the three
contending ports of the South have not, long ere
this, got what they claim. The committee have
been waiting for the friends of the several claims
of Charleston, Brunswick, and Beaufort, to come
forward with authentic reports and the necessary
surveys and estimates to show that there is the
necessary depth of watei, and theother concomit-
ants which go to render any spot a fit location for
a navy-yard In regard to Charleston, the com-
mittee has had a number of reports, but though
there has been a member from Georgia on the
Naval Committee ever since I was there, yet noth-
ing has yet been done.
Mr DAWSON reminded the gentleman from
Vugima that Commodore Woolsey and Captain
Bhubnck had made reports in favor of Biunswick,
end had recommended it as a proper place foi a
naval depot.
Mr. WISE admitted this, but there were not
reports from the Department like those in favor of
Charleston. When the committee were urged to do
something for the South, particularly for Charles-
ton, he would iell his friend from South Carolina
ÍÁt. Legare] how the proposal had been met:
gentleman from North Carolina had come to
the committee, and asked that they would delay
the selection of a depot till reports should be re-
ceived in regard to all the ports claiming the ben-
efit, and he would tell the gentleman from Georgia
[Mr Dawson] that all the committee ever got in
relation to Brunswick was from a northern man
Mid a speculating company.
Mr. DAWSON said there had been a report
from the Navy Commissioners in its favor, which
had been printed by order of the House
Mr. WISE. But none from the Department I
have, myself, no opposition to Brunswick, on the
contrary, I believe it to be the best of the thiee,
and if proper reports shall be furnished to us, I
am ready to vote for it But 1 will tell my friend
how these things are obtained At the North
private individuals interest themselves in the im-
provement of the count) y as means of laismg the
value of property, they are more watchful, more
vigilant, more actne, more pushing than we
Georgia has the only piopei site foi a depot be-
tween Norfolk and the Capes of Flor.da, and yet
nothing was done in its favor till a Boston company
purchased land there, and erected on it houses,
which had been ftamed and fitted and made,
all ready to put up, in New England, and their
object now is to get a navy-yard established there,
that they may improve the value of their lands,
they are active, on the alert, and they will soon
have a fine Yankee town there Now, this is an
enterprise which a Georgia Legislature would
never once have thought of It would never have
entered into their dreams. And the honest truth
is just this, we are not so active, not so watchful,
not so enterprising as theyaie, and that is the rea-
son they get what we cannot The moment they
get hold of a prooer site, they beset and besiege
the ei gineers and the Department till, by hook or
by crook, they get a report in iw favor If the
gentleman from Georgia will go to work in the
same way, I suppose he can get as large an amount
of Government appropriations as they can.
I say this in no spirit of reproach. I consider
it as a compliment to the northern people It
forms the chaiactenstic difference between the
population of the North and the South. We in
the South claim to be high-minded, gentlemanly,
lordly fellows, who think nothing of money,and,
therefore, we are poor
Sir, I hope we shall get the question For my-
self, I shall vote against both the dry-docks I
think we have as many as we need.and I doubt if
we have now the money to pay for them I again
give notice that if the debate is continued, I shall
move to lay the bill on the table
Mr PETRIKIN said, thatm early life he had
been taught that men were elected to Congress by
their respective parties, to support and carry out
certain fixed principles which the successful party
professed to advocate, and thatmembers so chosen
were bound to vote for the measures of their re-
spective parties, that until very la'ely, he had con-
tinued in that belief, but he found he was much
mistaken in his impressions His mistake was not
confined to any one of the political parties, whether
Democratic or Federal, for recent experience had
shown, tl)at when money was the question, that
many of each party were ready to abandon all
their party pledges and principles, and associate
together for the purpose of consummating any
scheme to filch and trick the people out of their
money. When aspeeulation was in the way, many
members of Congress forget whether they were
Democrats, Federalists, or Whigs, and associated
together in a scramble for the public purse with a
view of getting as much of the money of the coun-
try, each delegation for its own particular section
of the Union, and if not directly for their own in-
dividual use, for that of their constituents, regard-
less of all other considerations than those of self-
interest, trampling under foot all constitutional
obligations or regard for the general interest and
prosperity of the country
Mr P was opposed to all partial legislation, or
making laws for the benefit of partieular sections
of the country, to the manifest injury and preju-
dice of the rest of the Union He had observed,
day after day, and week after week, the time of
Congress consumed by members declaiming against
the extravagance of the Government, and the ln-
ciease of the expenses of the present Administra-
tion, and yet, on all occasions, he found those men
ready to advocate and vote for all appropriations,
regardless of whether the money thus voted was
for useful and necessary purposes or not He had
listened to members on all sides of the House,
making speeches for home consumption, inculca-
ting economy and retrenchment, but the momenta
bill was brought into the House, granting thou-
sands and tens of thousands of the public treasure
in the shape of pensions to generals, colonels,
captains, or commodores, or the widows of some
of the aristocracy, without thecolor of righ', either
m law or equity , or millions to be expended m the
erection of dry docks, fortification1!, artificial har
bors, useless light-houses, or vessels of war, to rot
in the harbors, those noisy preachers of economy,
both Democrats and Federalist", were found, al
most to a man, in the suppoitof what they wished
to be thought by the people they were opposing
He said he could not have patience with such sel
fish inconsistency Let a meritorious but poor
old soldier apply for relief, or an honest claim be
brought forward, which does not go to enrich their
constituents, then we are told by these men that
i the Government has no money, and that we must
I not make any new appropriations, or a national
j debt must be created, yet these very raen, almost
in the same breath, when it suited their purposes,
1 would vote for the most extravagant sums to con-
tribute to their own local interests or further their
political schemes or private ambition He could
see no bounds to this iniquitous system. He was
' opposed to both the bill and amendment, on the
grounds that the public service did not lequire at
present the erection of a dry dock, euher at New
I York or Philadelphia If a dry dock was neces-
, sary at those places, it was necessary at every
navy-yard Money ought not to b  appropnated
I at any time for purposes which were not of a gen-
eral benefit, or for services rendered to the coun-
try, especially at a t>me when it is more than
| probable the money will have to be raissd by tarea,
either indirectly m the shape of an iniquitous tariff,
taking the money from the many and liidustrtbtrs
part of the people, to put into the pockets of the
few idlers, speculators, ana loafers, or directly, on
the property of the people; either way the taxes
must be paid by the producers and consumers, and
not by the bankers and speculators who are fatted
by creating methods of taxing and burdening the
people
Mr P. denied that those works wefe necessary
for the public interest. They might say what they
pleased, but the most careless observei must see
that it was private interest, and not public good,
tnat was the ruling principle of action in all these
cases What care those who were the promoters
of these species of works about the welfare of the
public' The fact was, that when a few specula-
tors have a lot of land they thought they could,
make a good market of, or a stone quarry, or the
prospect of an office for themselves or some rela-
tive to superintend the erection of the work, they
immediately laid their heads together, and formed
a plan for the erection of a dry-dock, a light-house,
a foi tification, a harbor, or any thing else by which
they could make a good speculation, by getting a
law passed authorizing the work, and compelling
the Government to buy their land, give them the
stone contract, or, by management, get both, and
the office of superintendent into the bargain. He
denied that the sum asked m the present bill was
for the interest of the public No man on thp
floor could conscientiously deny bat that we had
dry-docks enough for all the purposes of our
navy, and why lay the foundation foi an expend-
iture of two or three millions of dollars, when
the public service does not require it*
Members who advocated this bill talked about
the necessity of providing for ship-building, and
the protection and welfare of oui navy. But the
recent history of the country had taught him a
lesson about ship-buildmg which he could not
forget Was it not a fact lhat most of our large
ships had been built, at an immense cost, for the
sole purpose of putting the money of the country
raised off the honest yeomanry into the pockets
of, comparatively speaking, a few speculators and
contractors, and keeping in idleness and luxury a
set of sinecure officers > He would name some of
those vessels to refresh the apparently short mem-
ories of some gentlemen. The Ohio ship of the
line made one voyage, and then was laid away to
rot, and had just been rebuilt, scarcely a single
plank, spike, or bolt of the old vessel remaining
of her first construction, and nothing else except
the name. Again- there was the Independence,
which shared a worse fate; she was not only
suffered to rot, but when rebuilt reduced in size,
and the apology was that those nuisances, the
Commissioners of theNavy,or some one of them,
had interfered in the first place, and spoilt her so
that she could not be used He also named other
instances of ships having been built and suffered
to rer-iam m harbor and rot, because there was no
use for them, and not for want of a dry-dock to
lepair them in
Mr P said that our navy had degenerated ever
since it had fallen under the special care of specu-
lators and jobbers, our sh ps were not so good in
their construction, nor was there that character
attached to the officers It had ceased to be the
object of emulation among a large proportion of
our officers who should excel the other in disci-
pline, but the great object now was who should
get the most money and do the leait service
There were some few honorable exceptions among
the officers of the Navy, but a reference to the pen-
sion list would exhibit a deplorable falling off in
tnat pride of character which stimulated the offi-
cers of the Navy to deeds of glory, which aston-
ished the world during the late war with England.
Where, (seid Mr P ) must we look for the cause
of all tins' To the improper legislation of Con-
gress It is the fault of the representatives of the
people, who forget their duty and vote away the
money of the country with a prodigality which
indicates not only a want of political principle,
but also a want of moral honesty Mr P. said he
could not find fault with the conductof the members
of Congress who were Federalists TheVjin voting
for this bill, and all others of the like kind, acted
J^in accordance with their avowed doctrines and
