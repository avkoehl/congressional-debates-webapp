OXFORD, December 23, 1862.

General GRANT:

GENERAL: Having learned that a strong cavalry force was 5 miles east of Waterford at 3 o'clock, I have ordered Colonel Hatch, with his entire command, to move immediately toward Pontotoc and see if he cannot get on track of the rebels. Have also sent orders to General Lauman, General Denver, and the officers in command of guards for trains to be on the alert, and guard especially against any cavalry dash.

JAS. B. MCPHERSON,

Major-General.

HOLLY SPRINGS, MISS., December 23, 1862.

Major General J. B. MCPHERSON, Oxford, Miss.:

A force of rebel cavalry are now encamped at the mouth of Tippah Creek, going south with a large number of led horses and mules, probably those captured here. The main body of the rebels went north from here. Send this word to Hatch. By properly directing his course he may recover much that was lost here.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
