Roanoke must depend on circumstances. Should Gaston be your best point to reach the Roanoke, as stated by Generals Holmes and Gatlin, you would have the advnatage of the bridg eat that place on w hich to cross the river; but unless you could bring supplies with you I think your army would suffer. I have sent an engineer office rto examine the crossings, roads, &amp;c., from Danville to Field's Ferry, below Clarksville. I recommend you do the same. Information as to what provisions and forage can be relied on I think also desirable. In my opinion the farther east we confine Sherman the better, and the more room it will allow for maneuvering the armies. I have enderavored to giuve you all information necessary for determining your operations. If there is any point on which you wish further, please advise me. I have not pretended to lay down fixed rules, which at this distance and at this time cannot safely be done, but rely upon your good judgment and skill to accomplish everything that is possible to attain our common end-the greatest success. Unity of purpose and harmony of action between the two armies, with the blessing of God, I trust will relieve us from the difficulties that now beset us.

Most truly and respectfully, yours.

R. E. LEE,

General.
