Hardison's Mill, Tenn., November 28, 1864 - 2.40 p.m.

Captain E. T. WELLS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Headquarters Sixth Division:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that the enemy are now engaging me from across the river at Hardison's Mill Ford and Morris' Ford (half a mile below Hardison's), with at least a brigade. He also shows a column moving up the river to my left. The officer guarding the fords near your front has sent for re-enforcements, as he is not able to guard some new fords with his present numbers. He is ten miles from here, over a very rough and intricate road, and I do not feel able to send him more men. He has not been attacked except by a few scouts.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HORACE CAPTRON,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
