These apprehensions may prove unfounded; but as the enemy may well despair of triumphing in a land attack on your strong defenses, it may be that he will seek to cover his failure by an attempt

*To a Georgia brigade, in Stevenson's division.

+Cobb's command had been the District of Middle Florida.
