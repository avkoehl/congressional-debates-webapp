the Federal party and of Federal principles So
long as the Democraticor State-Rights paity shall
maintain the ascendency, the effoits of Abolition-
ists will be comparatively innocuous, but when-
ever the political power of this country shall be
■swayed by Federal hands, the designs of the Abo-
litionists will well nigh have reached their con
summation Shall I be told that the Federalists
are not all Abolitionists? This may be partially
tme, but then are not all Abolitionists necessarily
Federalists' How can they expect to accomplish
their object—the general abolition of slaveiy—
but thiough the Federal power, and m pursuance
of Federal principles' Certainly they cannot be
so grossly ignorant as to suppose that the Demo-
ctatic State-rights doctrine of stuct constiuction
would be favorable to their views, or that it would
be possible to achieve their object through the
influence of Democratic principles, or by virtue
of Democratic legislation
But again if the Federalists are not now all
Abolitionists, the time will soon come when they
must become so as a paity, or otherwise fall into
a contemptible and hopeless minority Which
will they do' Will they repudiate abolitionism
and Abolitionists, and, by so doing, insure their
own political destiuction ' Oi will they maintain
and strengthen the league already formed with
the Abolitionists, in the hope of securing and
confirming their political existence and ascend-
ency? Which will they do, I ask' Why, sir,
if we shall judge of their futuie course by their
past conduct, it will be no difficult mattei to de
teimine what they will do They will do, as
they ever have done, sacrifice eveiy punciple of
honor, of virtue, and of patuotism, if it be ne
cessary to enable them to direct and control the
political power and destinies of the Republic
When, let me ask, have the Federal pirty evei
shown by then acts that their love oí countiy
was paiamount to their love of power' Never,
su, never1 But this is not all The coalition
between the Ftdeiahsts and Abolitionists was
not only to have been expected, for the reasons
already stated, but fiom considerations of still
gieater pith and moment
In all civilized communities, the two extremes
of society—the affluent and the breadles, the
powerful and the impotent—come together and
wai upon the center—the intermediate classes
Such ever has been, and ever will be the case It
is, m fact, a law of human society, and well do
the Federal paity understand the opoiations of
this, law Ilence their constant effoits to make
the poor poorei, and the feeble more impotent
And hence it has ever been the policy, the aim
and object of the Federal anstociacy of tins coun-
tiy, to impoverish, depreciate, and degrade the
Democracy, especially that portion who, in obe-
dience to the mandate of Heaven," eat their biead
in the sweat of then face " To accomplish this,
their purpose, the 1 ederahsts have availed them
selves of every means in their power They have
stigmatized the Democracy as infidels, leveleis,
agrauans They have done more They have
vitiated the elective franchíse by political coercion,
by bubery, and corruption And moie than all,
they have defrauded the Demociacy of then equal
political rights by means of unequil, unjust, and
exclusive legislation And now, in order to ren-
der the condition of the laboring classes of the
North and East still more dependant and de-
pressed, the Federal party have joined the Aboli-
tionists, foi the purpose of conferring upon the
black laborer nominalfieedom, a.n& upon the white
laborer virtual bondage ' Yes, sir, for the especial
purpose of humbling and degrading the Democ-
racy, have the Federal party of the North and
Eastjotned in the abolition crusade, and when-
ever their object shall be attained, and the south-
ern negro shall be brought to compete with the
northern white man in the labor market, the
moral and political charactei, the pride, power,
and independence, of the latter are gone forever,
and Federalism will have realized its fondest and
most cherished hopes But let me tell you, su,
the Democracy of the North and East are notun-
mindful of passing events. Since abolitionism
assumed a political character, they have watched
the movements of the Federal abolition party
with deep concernment They are conscious of
the approaching danger, and are coolly and delib-
No. 16
erately preparing to face it Yes, sir, whenever
the Democracy observe the Federal party prose-
cuting a political measure with z<>al and vigor, as
they now do abolitionism, they involuntarily,
instinctively gather up their energies to meet and
repel approaching mischief, and I warn them
now, they cannot prepare too soon, nor with too
much vigoi and forecast. The crisis approaches
The fearful conflict, the mortal struggle, the tiger
strife is at hand, and God alone can tell the re-
sult
Note —Mr Moore was called to order, in the course
of Ins remarks by General Wabdt Thompson, of South
Carolina, and by tlie decision of the Chatr was prevented
from concluding Ins speech Mr Moonx, before taking his
¡seat, gave notice that he would publish all that he had in
tended to say, precisely in tin same form and manner he
would have done had no interruption taken place
EMIGRANT INDIANS
SPEECH OF HON. A. H. SEVIER,
OF ARKANSAS,
In the Senate, Febiuaiy 23, 1839,
On the bill to provide for the secant} and protection of the
emigrant and other Indian tribe  west of the States of
Missouri and Arkansas
Mr  SEVIER said
Mr PnrsiDEST The object of the bill now un-
der con«ideiation is, what its title puipoi ts, " to
piovide foi the secuuty and protection of the emi
grant and othei Indian tribes west of the States
of Missouri and Aikansas " And I might add
that its object is also to piovide for the security
and piotertionof the fi on tier settlements of those
States, and for the civilization and general welfaie
of the Noith American Indian race
These, Mr Piesident, aie the objects of the
bill, and to accomplish them effectually, the bill
proposes to establish, in the countiy set apait,
by our laws and our tieaties, for the peimanent
residence of the Indian tubes, an Indian territo
nal government
That such an organization, for s^ch a popula
tion, undei our authoiity, is ntvv, I am leady to
admit But should it appear, in the piogiess of
this discussion, that such an establishment, on
the score of efficiency and economy, is piobaoly,
of all otheis, the best calculated to secuie and
piotect the Indians against each other, as well as
our own citizens in their vicinity, I feel assured
that though the measure may be new, it will le
ceive, as it did at the last session of Congicss,
the maikcd and decided approbation of this body
The country proposed to be organized into a Ter-
ritory is described in the fiist section of the bill,
and is as follows
" CfgiwiMj at Hie sources of the Puncah river , thence
down said nvtr toMi <=oun liver, thencedown the Mi nun
rivei, on tho southwt. t haul to the Statf of M sour
thence along the western line of the Slate of Missouri tithe
northvvc t corner of the fetate ot Aikansas thence dong
tlie western boundary oí the blue of Arkansas to Red nvcr
thence u¡j ttf d liver to a point two hundred mitesm i direct
course we-*t ot the State of Arkansas , thence ill a direct hue
to the beginning "
This country, it will be perceived, is beyond
the boundaues of any State or organized Tern
tory or white settlement Its average breadth is
something over two hundred miles, and its length
about six hundred It contains an aiea of about
eighty millions of the public land, and is healthy,
well watered, sufficiently timbered, and a gieat
deal of it lemarkably fertile, and is well adapted
foi agricultural and pastoia! pui poses Lead ore,
lion ore, coal, and salt springs have been discov
ered m it In short, all those who reside there,
as far as my knowledge extends, are well pleased
with their situation This, sir, is a short descnp
tion of the country—a country which is held by
them, by virtue of our treaties, in fee simple, and
which, consequently, is forever beyond our reach,
except in the double contingency of its abandon-
ment by the tribes,or oftheirextinction, in either
of which events it reveits to the United States,
and comes once more into our possession, and is
subject to our disposal as other public land This
perpetual tenure is reaffirmed in the first section
of this bill
Sir, until íecentlv a vast majority of these In
dians resided within the limits of the States, and
while m thatconditionitwasnot in our power to
i do much for them, and the uncertain tenure by
| which they held their lands, their embarrassment
by State legislation, and the constant encroach-
1 ment upon then soil by the whites, dissuaded
i them fiom doing much for themselves.    Most
happily, Mr President, these difficulties no longer
I exist.    In puisuance of a wise, humane, and sal-
| utary policy, these Indians have been sent out
from among us, and are placed side by side of
each other, m then new homes, beyond the leach
of furthei encroachment or intrusion     In this
location, for the first time since the Revolution,
we feel ourselves umestiained, in our legislation
for them, by any question of jurisdiction, or
power, or policy, and, on their part, they have
imbibed a stimulus to exertion, in feeling that
they have a peimanent home, in feeling untram-
meled by State laws, and unmolested by unwel-
come intiuders     Then location is fortunate for
us on anothei  account     They are now remote
from any unfnendly foreign influence in time of
war, and in time of peace we find them a great
convenience in cailying on, through their coun-
try, a profitaule commeice to Santa Fé
Ben gthuspermanentlysettledjitnow becomes
our duty to view them in then new position, and
to shape our legislation accordingly We must
now give up oui temporary measures, and place
I our íelations with them upon a iiim and solid
basis We ure bound by solemn treaty obliga
tions to them, we aie bound by duty to oui own
j people in then vicinity, to provide permanently
] and effectually for the mutual peace and piotec-
tion of all pames and, to succeed in the accom-
plishment of these high national obligations,
something else is requued at our hands than forts,
and troops, and bayonets, or agencies, or super-
intendences, oi the potent eloquence of annuities.
Yet all of these, fji the pie->eitt, at leaist, I con
sider essential ingiedicnts in carrying out the
objects of this bill, but they are not all that is
necessaiy Something el«e is requned, and that
is the adoption of some ohhgatoi j, binding, intn-
national lawi or legulatiowi, tor tne amicable ad-
justment of all the differences which may occur
among the respec'ive tubes The commission of
fiaud, or trespass, or f ¡ony, by an individual of
one tribe upon an individual of another tribe, must
cense to be a justifiable cause for war among them.
These injunes must be rediessed by law, in a
peaceable manner
Sn, picv lous to the commencement of the policy
of locating the Indians west, it must be borne in
mind that the indigenous tubes of that region,
fiom time immemorial, had been engaged n wars
not only among themselves, but had also been at
wai, for the same length of time, with the tribes
east of the Mississippi river—with some of the
identical Indians we have located in their imme
díate neighboihood Foi examjile, the Osages,
who weie once formidable, frequently sent out
war pai ties cast of that river, and these tribes thus
assailed, in their tuin, invaded the Osage countiy
west of that uver
The rcmcmbiance of these long existing feuds
and mutual injuries is yetfiesh in the recollec-
tion of all of them of the present day, and these
remimsccnses but too fiequently display them-
selves in acts of open murder and secret assassi-
nation
We have not only these indigenous tribes—
who have never been substantially at peace—to
govern, but we have also some seventeen or eigh-
teen emigrant tubes to manage and control, and
of the latter of these we have good reason to an-
ticipate some trouble, on account of the ill feeling
some of them beai us, aiismg fiom causes occur-
ung previous to then removal, and these causes,
whether real or ímaginaiy, arc not likely to be
soon forgotten
The tubes now residing in this Territory do
not feel bound to pence by the existence of any
international law The only law, at this time,
which they understand or appreciate, is that most
destructive of all otheis, the law of)etaliation
Theie are now in the Terutory about ninety-
five thousand Indians, belonging to twenty two
separate tribes, and speaking as many different
languages    Some few of these, the Choctaws, the
