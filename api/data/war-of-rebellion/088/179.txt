reserve in readiness to move into the three redoubts without delay if ordered. The general also desires that you see General Warren as soon as possible and find out the locality of this redoubts, the avenues to them, and the necessary dispositions to be made in occupying them.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. V. RICHARDS,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,August 14, 1864-5 p. m.

General GREGG,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: The enemy are moving very rapidly out of their pits to our right, scattering, however, and I do not think they have a large force. The right of their line looks very weak at present. I think they are trying to concentrate on General Barlow. I advise you, therefore, to have your cavalry vedettes well out. If everything is quiet to-night, General Birney will come over on this side and will extend our line to-morrow.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 14, 1864-6.20 p. m. (Received 7 p. m.)

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding:

GENERAL: I sent you a dispatch to the effect that the enemy occupied the old rifle-pits of '62 on the Charles City road, but that this p. m. I drove them out. This, near Fisher's. Search was everywhere made, but no water could be found in that vicinity for horses. My horses have not been watered since last night, but I can get a little near the New Market road.

Yours, respectfully,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
