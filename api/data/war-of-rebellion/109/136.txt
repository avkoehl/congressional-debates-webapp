FRANKFORT, April 23, 1861.

Honorable GREEN ADAMS:

DEAR SIR: You may show anything I write to General Scott. it may be important to keep him posted. First. Our Governor is in telegraphic correspondence with the Secretary of War at Montgomery, and now actually hatching bloody treason, in my opinion. Second. If possible I will get copies. Third. He is now at Louisville trying to borrow money from the banks; pretendedly to arm the State-really to arm traitors in our midst, and thus enable them to kill or control us. I have seen one bank president (Major Johnson), and written to our friends in Louisville not to give him a dollar. Fourth. I shall not be surprised at an invasion of Tennessee and Kentucky to countenance a violent uprising, for they know we can beat them at the polls. Fifth. I doubt if the Governor will recognize Lincoln's call of Congress by ordering an election of members. On the contrary, he had his masters, Breckinridge &amp; Co., are on the lookout for 'something to turn up." The triumph of the Union party is their eternal political death and they are becoming desperate. Sixth. Note well what Scott says and wants done, and keep me advised.

Yours, truly,

LESLIE COOMBS.
