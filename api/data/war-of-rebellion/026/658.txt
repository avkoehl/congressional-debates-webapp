FORT MONROE, April 26, 1863.

Major-General PECK,

Commanding, Suffolk:

I send you to-day by mail a brigadier-general's commission for Colonel Harland. General Gordon was here yesterday and has gone back for his staff. He will return in a few days. I am not quite sure whether I shall be with you to-day. The enemy has no artillery where General Getty captured the battery. Lieutenant Bowe, of the West End, volunteers to pilot the Commerce down. Shall he try?

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, VA., April 26, 1863.

Major-General HOOKER,

Army of the Potomac:

Longstreet is still here. Heavy artillery is coming to him from Petersburg. The storm has ceased; mud drying up. Advise me in cipher of as much as you deem proper of your operations.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

APRIL 26, 1863.

Major-General PECK, Suffolk, Va.:

Your dispatch received. I have been delayed in my operations by the severe storm. I have communicated to no one what my intentions are. If you were here I could properly and willingly impart them to you. So much is found out by the enemy in my front with regard to movements that I have concealed my designs from my own staff, and I dare not intrust them to the wires, knowing as I do that they are so often tapped.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, VA., April 27, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

Major Stratton reports that he destroyed a new ferry-boat at Camden, opposite Elizabeth. Three hundred guerrillas at Elizabeth, called Fifty-sixth North Carolina. He is advised of 500 cavalry and four pieces in that vicinity, with a regiment of infantry at Woodville. Union men are the sources. The Fifth Virginia Infantry has left Woodville for Suffolk.

A party attempted to cross near Sleepy Hole last night in boats.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, April 27, 1863.

Colonel D. T. VAN BUREN, Fort Monroe:

The engineer and captain of the Commerce refuse to run her. Will a payment of &amp;50 to a volunteer engineer be authorized?

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.
