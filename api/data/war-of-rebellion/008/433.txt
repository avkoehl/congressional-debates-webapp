RICHMOND, MO., December 13, 1861.

Major-General HALLECK:

On yesterday we drove the last of the organized forces of rebels from Platte and Clay across river at Lexington. Had slight skirmish. We killed some 3 or 4. They fired from houses in Lexington, and to silence them we gave them eleven shots from 6-pounder field pieces. Will drive them from this county to-day and to-morrow, and then move to Carrlton.

Be on the qui vive to-night and to-morrow. Strengthen your pickets and tell them to keep a vigilant lookout. Let every man be at his post, and have your men sleep on their arms.

General JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Commanding Post, Cairo, Ill.:

Information just received, in connection with that obtained a few days ago, leads me to believe an attack upon Bird's Point or Fort Holt to-night or to-morrow quite imminent. I have given the necessary orders to the commanders there; also orders to secure prompt movements with our transports. Commodore Foote has also been notified of our danger and requested to co-operate. It will be advisable to have all the troops at this point notified that they are to keep within their camps. Ammunition should be issued, so as to give cartridge boxes full, and the command sleep under arms.

U. S. GRANT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT SOUTHEAST MISSOURI,Cairo, Ill., December 13, 1861.

Brigadier-General McCLERNAND,

For security and expedition, in case of an attack, you will please quarter on the steamer now in port four regiments. The following boats can be used: Aleck Scott, Memphis, White Cloud, and J. Wilson.

U. S. GRANT,
