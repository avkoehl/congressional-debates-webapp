HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, September 23, 1863-9 a.m.

Major-General McCOOK,

Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

The general commanding directs you to put your spare forces at work on the interior line. Be careful not to weaken your front line so as not to be able to bring your whole force into action, if necessary. It would be well to mask your interior line with bushes, so as to cover the work from sight. General Morton has been ordered to report to you at once to locate the line.

Very respectfully,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,Brick House near Fort, September 23, 1863.

Very respectfully,

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General.

General P. H. SHERIDAN,

Commanding Third Division:

General McCook directs that you furnish as soon as practicable a detail of 370 men for fatigue duty to-night, to report to Lieutenant Chandler, of the Pioneer Corps, in rear of red brick house near General Davis' line. A sufficient number of officers will be included in the number to take charge of the detail. They will bring their arms with them, and a few axes and picks. They will be required to work only a portion of the night.

It is regretted that so much work is required of your weary men, but the public service requires it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
