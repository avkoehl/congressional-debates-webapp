HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, May 7, 1864.

Lieutenant-General EWELL,Commanding Corps:

GENERAL: I am directed by General Lee to instruct you to call the attention of officers to the importance of seeing that the troops are promptly supplied with ammunition. Precaution should be taken that the supply in the hands of the men is not exhausted before additional is procured. It will not do to wait until the ammunition is entirely exhausted before steps are taken to resupply the men. The general also desires that the ammunition be husbanded as much as possible, and that the men do not discharge their guns unless they are the enemy is before them.

Respectfully,

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Copy to General Stuart.)

General R. E. LEE:

GENERAL: The enemy flanked around my line of skirmishers and compelled me to leave the position at the mouth of the lane. I am, however, very near it, and am now moving up to take the same position again. They came back to Todd's Tavern again this morning, and are again operating on the same ground on which they were yesterday on the Brock road, between Todd's Tavern and the left of their infantry line.

J. E. B. STUART,

Major-General.

P. S.-The enemy fired 2 or 3 shots of artillery from the direction of Stevens' house.
