Major T. S. BOWERS,

Everything is quiet on my front, but there is sharp firing on my left, either from the force beyond Hatcher's Run of from General Ord's line. I will report on getting further information.

March 30, 1865.

Major-General WEBB,

I have the honor to report that everything has been perfectly quiet on my lines during the past twenty-four hours. Sixteen deserters were received, and one man from the Tenth New Jersey Volunteers deserted to the enemy.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 30, 1865-1 p. m.

Major-General PARKE:

Deserters to Humphreys report Heth's and Wilcox's divisions as moved to the enemy's right, across Hatcher's Run. It is not supposed the whole of these divisions have moved, but the enemy has undoubtedly weakened himself in your front. If this information should be confirmed during the day, you will be required to attack at early daylight to-morrow. You will, therefore, make all preliminary arrangements with that object in view.

GEO. G. MEADE.

(Same to General Wright.)
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,March 30, 1865.

Major-General MEADE:

Your dispatch of 1 p. m. received. It is so foggy that the enemy's movements cannot be distinctly discovered from here, but there is nothing to indicate that his force in my front is diminished, except by Pickett's division. A good lookout will be kept and deserters carefully examined and result reported. The troops will be prepared for prompt attack at daylight and ready for orders, which I understand you will send if you desire the attack made.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
