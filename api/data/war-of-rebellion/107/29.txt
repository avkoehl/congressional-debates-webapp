and there present), upon suggestion of Captain Harris, the section of Rogers' battery under command of Lieutenant Heaton, stationed at that point, and COLONEL Smith's command, were ordered to change front in order to meet an advance of the enemy, which it was thought might be made in that direction. General Beauregard, perceiving this movement, sent an order to these troops to advance, which they promptly did, Captain Harris proceeding with them, and subsequently placing the section of Rogers' battery ineffective position near Captain Imboden's battery, from whence the section fired with effect upon the enemy until the ammunition was exhausted. Colonel Smith from this position soon took part in the battle, having many of his officers and men killed or wounded and his own horse wounded. (For further particulars see his repot.*)

The removal of these troops from their position on Young's Branch uncovered a portion of my front line, and his left that line exposed, to be penetrated by the enemy; but I am satisfied that he movement of our troops was unperceived by him, as the position was covered by a thicket of willows and other threes skirting the edge of Gull Run at this point. Closely observing from my own central and elevated position on the hill north of Lewis' house (a position, nevertheless, over which a cross fire of most of the enemy's batteries continued to throw shot an shell for hours, in the midst of which I necessarily stood observing)- I say form this position the various movements of our own troops I anxiously watched for the moment when I might withdraw the greater portion of the brigade not then actually engaged from the front line, without inviting disaster in that quarters, in order to throw it forward to the support of our men so hotly pressed on our left. General J. E. Johnston appearing near my position about this time, I called his attention tot he state of my command on the front and right of Lewis' farm, and referred for his decision the expediency of risking the abandonment of that front, and of immediately ordering forward the whole of the balance of my command to take part in the battle now raging and becoming critical as to its issue on our left. It was decided to make the movement, and I immediately dispatched my aides to order up at double- quick the regiments of Withers, Preston, and Strange, and the battery of Latham, and proceeding myself to meet those regiments, I advanced with them rapidly to the most active scene of the conflict. Hunton's regiment, being in advanced position, was first in the battle, but as I led on the other regiments to other positions it was separated from me, and for ht part which it took in the battle I must refer to Colonel Hunton's report, hereafter to be made. Colonel Hunton since the battle having been ordered to Leesburg with his regiment, I have neither seen him nor been able to obtain any report.+

Withers' Eighteenth Regiment Virginia Volunteers was the next in order taking part in the battle. Colonel Withers' report is full, and clearly shows the gallant and distinguished part which it enacted in achieving the great victory of the day.++ Latham's battery followed Withers' regiment. This battery being now full, the four pieces having come together and replenished their ammunition chest, was, under ht guidance of Captain Harris, of the Engineers, advanced to a position to the left of the road leading from Lewis' house toward Stone Bridge, from which position it fired with effect upon the head of a column advancing from toward the turnpike, and together with the fire of another battery succeeded in driving back the column.
