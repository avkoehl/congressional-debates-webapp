February 9, 1864.

Brigadier General B. H. GRIERSON,

Memphis, Tenn.:

What do you ascertain about the ammunition and pontoons? The information I get renders it all-important that we get off at the earliest possible moment. Is the Germantown force preparing a crossing over the Coldwater?

WM. SOOY SMITH,

Brigadier General, Chief of Cavalry, Mil. Div. of the Mississippi.

COLLIERVILLE, TENN.,

February 9, 1864-9.15 p.m.

Brigadier General B. H. GRIERSON,

Memphis, Tenn.:

Dispatch from Colonel McMillen is received. Move your Germantown brigade to-morrow, via Olive Branch, Byhalia, and Tallaloosa, to Waterford. From this point let it threaten a crossing of the Tallahatchie, at the railroad bridge, in conjunction with the infantry brigade which I will order to move on Wyatt. I will meet you at Germantown and give you all particulars.

WM. SOOY SMITH,

Brigadier General, Chief of Cavalry, Mil Div. of the Mississippi.

COLLIERVILLE, February 9, 1864.

Brigadier-General BUCKLAND:

Let Colonel McMillen move his command to Wyatt, where I will communicate with him. I design using him in conjunction with my cavalry against Forrest if he makes a stand in the neighborhood of Oxford. I have positive information that Forrest's command is concentrating at Oxford. I have no fear that he will attempt moving to the north until I have passed the Tallahatchie. If McMillen can disencumber himself of his train without weakening his force materially, he had better do so.

WM. SOOY SMITH,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Cavalry.

GERMANTOWN, February 9, 1864-9 p.m.

Lieutenant INGERTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Collierville:

Scouting party sent to communicate with Colonel McMillen just returned. Report that McMillen crossed the Coldwater at 4 p.m. yesterday, at Perry's Ferry, 1 mile below where the railroad crosses the Coldwater. He was traveling on the Panola road, and intended to encamp last night at Hickory Hill.

A. W. McCLURE,

Aide-de-Camp.
