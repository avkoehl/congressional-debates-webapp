III. You will order all conscripts between the ages of eighteen and forty in your command to be enrolled immediately, and all that do not volunteer in the cavalry service for twelve months you will over to the Confederate authorities.

IV. You will assume command of all State cavalry in District Numbers 5, State of Mississippi, and organize all the companies into battalions and regiments, except such as may have been organized by Major-General Gholson. You will report for duty to Brigadier-General Chalmers, commanding District Numbers 5, at Panola, and order Captains Price, Forrest, and Dunn, with their commands, to report to you at that point.

By order of John J. Pettus, Governor and Commander-in-Chief:

JONES S. HAMILTON,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

JACKSON, April 18, 1863.

Colonel GORGAS, Chief of Ordnance, Richmond, Va.:

If ammunition for the three 9-inch guns is not sent with them, they will be useless to me. Have heard nothing from you of bolts for the Brooke gun now here. Without bolts it had as well been left in Richmond. I have no coal, and am unable to get any.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

TULLAHOMA, April 19, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

I have telegraphed troops to be stopped, and given them orders to return or advance, according to your information of Grant's movements. General Rust has an extra section of Hudson's; of at Jackson, it could be spared, and is needed here.

J. D. BRADFORD.

JACKSON, April 18, 1863.

Brigadier General JAMES R. CHALMERS:

Colonel [J. G.] Stocks' regiment and all of [L.] Willis', except two companies, have been ordered to report to you. For the present, [W. M.] Inge's command must remain in Ruggles' district.

J. C. PEMBERTON.
