Mr. H gave way, without concluding, for the
orders of the day
Mr CAMBRELENG remaiked that his mo-
tion to suspend the private orders for the public i
business yesterday, included this day also, but
he observed from the Journal and the papéis that I
it was not so understood, and therefore he should ,
renew the motion this morning                                 I
Mr BIDDLE had, however, first caught the
Speaker's eye, and he asked leave to presenta
petition of a public natuie, with a view to have it
immediately refeired to the Committee on Foreign
Affairs.                                                                           Í
Mr. ADAMS would ask permission to present
no less than four hundred petitions of a public
natuie, with which he had been charged, and,
VMiless he could 4o so, he should object to others
having a preference given to them
Mr. BIDDLE thereupon moved a suspension i
of the rules.
Mr WILLIAMS, of North Carolina, inquired
what the memoiial was about
Mr BIDDLE stated that it was a memorial
from claimants on Mexico, setting forth the anx-
iety they felt that the tieaty of arbitiation should
have been suffered to fall tlnough by that Repub-
lic, and asking Congiess to take the matter into
its serious consideiatioii As only two weeks of
the session remained, it was desiiable that some
piompt action should be had upon it?
Tke lyles weie suspended, ayes 107, noes not
counted, the memorial received, and referred to
the Committee on Foieign Affairs
Mr B added tohispievtous statement that the
petition referied to the fact that the Piesident of
the United Spates, m his anxiety to have this
treaty ratified, sent a public vessel and a special
messengei to Mexico, that the vessel had re-
turned, and they declaie that the latest advices
from that Republieadd confumation to then con-
viction, that the treaty would not be ratified, as
was predicted by the clianman of the Committee

both to his State and to the country

solvent and sile, m ithei ot which is now employed is the
depository of the public monev collected insaid"State and
whereas, the money so collected in Illinois is deposited m
Ihe Slate Bank ol Missouri to the mamlest injury of the
said banks of Ilhnoia, and the ptople of the State, and
whereas, the Secretary of the Treasury, under the piovis
ions ot the act oí 1789 has selected many banks which
would have betn excluded from the benefits of the deposit
act of 1836 ac depositories < I the public money, winch said
banks,, in common with the banks of Illinois, could not
have been seh eted a  depositories of the public money
under tile provisions of the ict of 1836   Therefore,

and w outd be safe depositories, of ího ptifehc money
Mr sBVERETTsaiditrsust'beobvioug.ftottt
the reading of that resolution, that it would elicit
debate, and as it was more desirable that the
committees should report, he must object to its
reception at this time.
Mr. CASEY being asked to postpone his re-
quest till the other business was through, jephed
that he had been waiting for this opportunity for
a week, and if he waived the present, he might
never have another
As objection had been made, he must then
make a motion he had never before made, in the
seven sessions he had served in Congress, and
he moved to suspend the rules, and demanded the
yeas and nays, which, being ordered, were—
yeas 92, nays 68
So the rules were not suspended, the motion
requiring a majority of two thirds
