FRONT ROYAL, June 8, 1862.

General RICKETTS:

I am ordered to put you in command of a division recently commanded by Major-General Ord, who has been relieved. The infantry adn two brigades ordered to march to Warrenton are to be conveyed to Catlett's by rail, if they can get three days' rations cooked. One for use betweeen Catlett's and the other two for the march to Fredericksburg, it is presumed. The artillery, cavalry, and train, and a small infantry guard, will go to Catlett's by the best ordinary road. Please to order Dureyea's brigade to follow the others as soon as General Banks send troops to relieve it. Please see me to-morrow.
