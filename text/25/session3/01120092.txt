THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 4,
vision suggested by the Senator from Illinois was
the very amendment that the committee proposed
to offer, when the bill came up foi consideration,
as had just been notified to the Senate by the
chairman of the committee In relation to the
postponement, he hoped the Senate would make
the bill the special order of the day for to-moirow,
and give that earnest that it is not their intention
to permit it to be killed by delay
Mr BENTON observed that, to make the bill
the special order of the day for any day named,
even for to-day, would put it behind a bill (the
Cumberland road bill) which was already a spe-
cial order
Mr. WALKER said that, under all the circum-
stances, and as he thought the Senate would piob-
ably adjourn over to Monday, he would, for his
part, agree to make the bill the special order for
that day, provided he had a general understand-
ing, both from the opponents of the bill and fi om
the friends of the Cumberland road bill, that no
other business should take precedence of it on
that day
This understanding being generally given,
The question was taken, and the bill was post-
Eoned to, and made the order of the day for,
londay next
The resolution submitted yesterday by Mr
Rives, relative to the transactions between the
Secretary of War and the agent of the Bank of
the United States, growing out of the sales of the
bonds of the said bank, came up for considera-
tion, and, aftei adebatem whichMessis RIVES,
WRIGHT, KING, and NILES, took part,
