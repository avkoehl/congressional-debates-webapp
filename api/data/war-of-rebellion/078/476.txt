BULL'S GAP, TENN., September 25, 1864.

General BURBRIDGE:

I fear delay will operate injuriously. Vaughn was still in my front at 4 p. m. yesterday. Deserters report that Giltner, with 500, has gone in Kentucky on raid, by way of Pound Gap. I do not think all rebels in East Tennessee and Southwest Virginia will exceed 2,700 effective, and they are this side of Abingdon. You must attack them in rear or they are this side of Abingdon. You must attack them in rear or they will be too strong for me. After leaving this place I will move as requested in your last telegram.

ALVAN C. GILLEM,

Brigadier-General.
