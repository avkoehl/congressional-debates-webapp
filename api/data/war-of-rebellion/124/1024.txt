COLUMBUS, OHIO, November 12, 1863.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Your dispatch communicating Lord Lyons" message is received. I had on the 10th instant received information that an attack upon Johnson's Island was feared, and at once sent 500 troops from Camp Cleveland and a battery from Camp Dennison to re-enforce the command at Johnson's Island. This force, with the steamer Michigan, now at that point, will be sufficient to defend the island against any force that can be brought against it. We have at Cleveland, Toledo, and Sandusky a volunteer militia force, about 600 strong at each place, well armed. I have this moment given these commands notice to be in readiness to obey any call I may make. General Mason will go to Johnson's Island to-day.

DAVID TOD.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Nothing special from Johnson's Island this evening. I doubt not we have made every provision necessary for its safety. The guard on the island has been increased 500. General Mason went up this morning and General Cox this evening. I have called out a volunteer militia force of 2,000 to assemble at Sandusky, and have ordered the volunteer forces at Cleveland and Toledo to hold themselves in readiness to come out at a moment's warning.

DAVID TOD,

Governor.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I renew my application for authority to increase the battalion on guard duty at Johnson's Island to a full regiment. The present force is entirely inadequate.

DAVID TOD,

Governor.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

We have at Cleveland and Toledo each a good company of State artillery force, but without guns. Is it possible for you to furnish them?
