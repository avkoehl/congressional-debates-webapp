cial revulsion lie much deeper than any measures of the Go
vernmen Men of sense, of all parties, cannot but see that if the
ban-ts or ihe merchants have traded beyond their means or the
wants of the country, the embarrassments which have followed
can bejustly chargeable upon no one but themselves He believed
that the tunc was not distant when all would be convinced that
the measures of the Government having a reference only to its
own revenues, had much less influence either for good or for
evil,on the cunoncy and monetary concerns oftliecountry, than
is generally supposed This Bubjeu 13 becoming daily better

calculated to embairás and delay resumption ]

SPEECH OK MR. STRANGE,
Of North Carolina.
In Senate, March, 23,  1838—On the resolution to
repeal the Specie Circular
Mr  STRANGE addressed the Senate as fol-
io w-
I shoild have piofited little by experience, ii I
did not feel conscious that I shall be in  a very |
«mall minority upon  this question,  and I should
not have troubled the Senate with  any remarks, 11 I
the Senator from Massachusetts,  [Mr Weesier,] j
had not thrown out some observations which ought 1
not, in my judgment, to go forth unanswered  That
Senator could have no motive, so far as this body
is concerned, in  addressing us      He could enter-
tain no duubt of his favorite measure passing by a
very laige majority, and I am persuaded he did not .
chenshifie  ^lightost hope ot «mmng over here a
single proselyte   It was far beyond these walls  hat
he intended nts remaiks to take effect, it was upon
the country at large he designed  they should ope
rate   I desire on rny part, so far as I may, to coun-
teract their tendency, and if any feeble voice can
be heard amid the roaring of the lion, to quiet as
iar as possible the undu    excitement they a^e cal-
culated to produce                                                   '
When the Senator from Kentucky introduced
his resolutions of which the present is a moditaca-
aon, 1 was absent from the Senate, and I confess
myt,eli gieatly surprised when 1 heard it had been
done All the topics embraced in them had al-
ready been fully discussed in this body, and the
country hid been agitated in a degree correspon-
dent to the warmth ot that discussion, and 1 could
not but feel surprised that a renewal thereof should be
solicited When a man is surprised at a fact, he
is naturally led to the inquiry why this lact came
into existence, and what consequences its authors
expect to ds-duce from it The acts of men otten 1
have an obvious palpible design, and another
more important, hidden <rom the eye of the super-
ficial observer, and it is the part of wisdomnarrowly
to examine the acts of others by which we are
likely to be affected, and endeavor to ascertain the 1
■whole compass of their objects, whether primary or
secondary, palpable or covert With respect to
the resolutions of the Senator from Kentucky, the
>IX TO TOSt eONGBESSIONAL
Specie Circular—Mr. Strange.
avowed objects, so far as I understand them, from
looking into the resolutions themselves, or at-
tending to the arguments advanced m their
support, were threefold The first was relief
to Government creditors—increased facility to
those who directly paid in the revenues of the
country I would not deny to this consideration
the respect it merits Bat legislation should always
be treated as a necessary evil, and ought never to
be resorted to but when the demand for its use is
urgent Even the most '«enefictal legislation is apt
te give rise to mischiefs not previously existing
It is proper, then, for us to inquire whether the
payers of revenue stand in any such need of relief,
as even, if we could lawfully do so, would render
it expedient for us to legislate in their behalf
Where is the evidence of any such need? Where
shall we look for marks of their distress? Or what
cry of theirs has come to our ears? I have seen, I
have heard none There is no such need, and in-
deed the friendo of the resolution do not seem to
urge this argument with any earnestness
The second object of the resolutions was the relief
of the banks, and in this is, in fact, contained the
whole pith and marrow of tha proceeding But I
deny that it will prove a permanent, wholesome
relief to the banks A temporary and seemingly
beneficial effect it may, and doubtless will, pro-
duce, but that it will infuse sound health into the
banking system of this country, is an idea opposed
alike to experience and sound philosophy. So far
from the piesent time being favorable for the re-
newal of iho connection between the Government
and the banks, it is peculiarly inauspicious
Who would give a patient, just passing out of the
cold into the hot stage of an mtermitient fever,
brandy, and other stimulants? Such applications,
if proper at all, were so when the collapse was first
coming on, with the hope of averting, or greally
mitigating it But when reaction is commencing,
and the fever beginning to rise, reason would seem
to forbid their use The banks are the habitual
subjects of intermittent fever Now the tide of
circulation courses through their arteries in an im-
petuous current, and now it moves sluggishly
along, scarcely giving impulse to the powers of
life. And what is their present condition' Js it
not notorious that they are passing from a state of
collapse into that of increased action, which will
be very soon heightened into a raging fever, to be
followed, as all must foresee, by another collapse,
more prostrating than any which have preceded it'
It is an established maxim in philosophy, that
action and reaction are equal In proportion, then,
as the excitement shall rise, so great will be the
succeeding prostration Looking to the interest of
the banks alone, tnen, I repeat, this is no time to ad-
mmis er to them tha t strongest of stimulan's, a re-
newed connection with the Government They are
now rising from that collapsed state in which a vari-
ety ofcauseshad contributed to throw them, and Na-
ture, by the application of her great law of reac-
tion is raising them up with great rapidity, and
our in erference would but piecipitate the opera-
tion beyond the point of safety Confidence, that
magic Being, when roused from her state of torpor,
is prone, from her very nature, to run into the
most extravagant excesses, and requires no en
couragement Business men, tired of the inac-
tivity which a time of pressure produces, as soon
as that p>-e sure is removed, rush eagerly into the
most extensive operations Stockholders, anxious
to b« indemnified for the very small profits they
have derived during the season of curtailment,
press the banks to seize the favorable occasion to
increase then discounts, and an abundance of mo-
ney in circulation, enables every man to purchase,
with a moderate premium, a credit which before
he had no means of commanding One stimulant
gives an increased action to another, and the tide
of events is setting in one direclion Dies not
prudence, then, dictate to us, that as we have no
poser to check it, we ought, at least, to contribute
nothing to its extravagant flow, and that least of
all should we embark the body politic upon its bo-
som' Take a single instance as a --ample of the
illimitable ex$e«* to which this thing is prone to
run, as appearing upon the very face of the resolu-
tions of the Senator from Kentucky    They con-
Senate.
tamed a proposition not only to receive the no^6
of the banks m payment of the public dues, but
that they should also be tendered to the pubic
creditors, and an actual refusal to reeeive then* by
such creditors should precede their being returned
upon the banks for redemption, or having any
other medium of payment offered to the creditor.
Thus taking a new and most extensive stride  
making the Government the guarantor of all the
paper circulation in the country. It is true the
Senator from Kentucky has stricken out that por-
tion of his resolution, but was that satisfactory to
all? Did not the Senator from Virginia, [Mr.
Rives,] insist upon retaining it, with some trivial
modifications,? And does not the fact that any
member (and that, too, a distinguished one of this
body) could be found willing to tender to public
creditors the notes ot all the banks m the United
States, alarmingly indicate the dangers of the sys-
tem out of which the proposition springs, and fur-
nish a striking admonition of what it is likely to
bring upon the countiy' But, sir, the policy of
connection between the Government and the banks
presents a very wide field for discussion, and as I
have heretofore occupied it pretty extensively, I
forbear for the present to enter it farther.
The third object of introducing thejresolutions
seemed to be the abolition of an odious discrimina-
tion in the medium of payment for the public lands
and the ordinary customs Now, sir, I am well
aware that this discrimination is odious to the peo-
ple, and it is natural, and perhaps right, that it
should be so, and the gentlemen in the Opposition
have spared no pains in availing themselves of
this circumstance to excite popular prejudice
against the Administration I wish they had been
equally diligent m pointing out to them the source
from whence this principle of discrimination
springs 1 am content that they shall address the
people m the strongest terms against discrimina-
tion, if they will let them know, at the same time,
in what soil this noxious plant finds its growth
The Constitution never contemplated the exercise
of any such discrimination, because it contemplated
but one medium—the precious metals—m the col-
lection of its dues If the finances of the country
had always been administered in the currency re-
cognised by the Constitution, every man would
have understood at once what he had a right to re-
ceive from the Government, and in what he was
bound to pay it, and there would have been no dis-
crimination and no murmuring The necessity for
discrimination grew out of the joint resolution oi
1816—the first legal authority for receiving the
du s of the Government in paper money. If gen-
tlemen reahy desire to abolish discrimination, lei
them repeal this resolution I have voted foi its
repeal as the most effectual, and, indeed, ¡he only,
mode of dispensing wuh discrimination. So long
as ihe Government dispenses wuh the constitutional
currency, discrimination will, of necessity, exist,
and pa«s what law you may to limit or prevent it,
discrimination must, in spite of them, pievail id,
practice If you wish to overcome an enemy, level
yourb'ow at his real lurking place, if you intend
effectually to destroy an evil, cut it up by the root 
Repeal the joint resolution ot 1816, and force your
public officers back upen the constitutional cur-
rency, and y ou will hear no more complaints about
inequalities in the media oi receipts and payments
The fcenator Irom ¡Massachusetts hasfatored us
w nh a history of the crcumstances which gave
rise to, and attended, the passage of the jomt reso-
lution if 1816, and with his opinion of its charac-
ter and design So far as his Historical reminis-
cences are concerned, I am not at all disposed to
question their correctness, they suit my purpose,
and enable me to arrive at a very d^erent conclu-
sion from his as to the operation of that act The
iramers ol our Constitution were hard money men,
and it was a hard money Constitution It was their
design (hat the Government shouldcol'ect its dues
in gold and siher, and such was the primitive prac-
tice The practice of receiving bank paper crept
in, and gradually progressed, until every thing
which bore the name of money, in the lorm oí
bank notes, was accepted by the public officers,
and grew into an obvious and pressing inconveni-
ence.   The current values of the notes received
