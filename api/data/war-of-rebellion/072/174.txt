CIRCULAR.] HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,

Near Atlanta, Ga., July 25, 1864.

The major-general commanding congratulates the troops upon the brilliant success which has attended the Union arms in the late battles, and which has been officially reported, as follows:

In the battle of the 20th instant, in which the Twentieth Corps, one division of the Fourth Corps, and part of the Fourteenth Corps, was engaged, total Union loss in killed, wounded, and missing, 1,733. In front of the Twentieth Corps there were put out of the fight 6,000 rebels. Five hundred and sixty-three of the enemy were buried by our own troops, and the rebels were permitted to bury 250 additional themselves. The Second Division, of the Fourth Corps, repulsed seven assaults of the enemy with slight loss to themselves, which must swell the rebel loss much beyond 6,000. Prisoners captured, 300, and 7 stand of colors. No report has yet been received of the part taken in this battle by the Fourteenth Army Corps.
