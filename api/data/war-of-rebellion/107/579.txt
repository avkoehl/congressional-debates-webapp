Brigadier General GEORGE A. McCALL,Commanding Division:

GENERAL: Pursuant to orders from Major-General McDowell, received last night, the headquarters of the department will leave this place at 8 o'clock this a. M. for Fredericksburg. The remainder of King's division (Cutler's brigade and Gerrish' artillery) moves at the same time, accompanied by the company of Davies' cavalry serving with your division, to the commanding officer of which orders were sent direct last night, or rather this a.

I telegraphed to the Adjutant-General about the order to Colonel Campbell's cavalry to join the Army of the Potomac, but no order has yet been received in the case. Should it arrive, be governed by it in directing Colonel Campbell's movements.

They are to remain till 22nd instant.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. SCHRIVER,
