HEADQUARTERS SIEGE TRAIN, June 28, 1864-2 a. m.

Lieutenant Colonel N. BOWEN,Assistant Adjutant-General, Eighteenth Army Corps:

COLONEL: Yours of 27th just received by mounted orderly. I do not quite understand it. I have already forwarded all my train prepared yesterday, i. e., three 30-pounder Parrotts and four 8-inch mortars. If you refer to these all is right. If you want still more, I have afloat twelve 8-inch mortars, but not enough shells to keep them all at work, as they were not in the country to be had. The Ordnance Department has issued proposals and expect some soon. I have over thirty siege guns afloat. About dark last night I received an order from General Grant's headquarters directing me to report to General Hunt for siege operations at Petersburg. I shall do so this morning, and will call at your headquarters on the way. It will be impossible to send anything more forward to-night, and I will start the unloading preparatory to so doing before leaving.

Your obedient servant,

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery, Commanding.

Will you please give me 800 men belonging to General Turner's division for four regiments of colored troops? I have been most unreasonably alarmed by them.

WM. F. SMITH,Major-General.
