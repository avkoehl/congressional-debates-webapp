[General R. S. EWELL:]

GENERAL: General Lomax states that Colonel Baker, commanding Gordon's brigade of cavalry, reports the enemy's infantry and cavalry as having crossed at Hanovertown, on the Pamunkey. The general commanding desires you to begin to withdraw your troops quietly and so as not to be seen, and to move back to the south side of the South Anna. Please direct General Breckinridge to put his column in motion at once.

Respectfully,

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

I have given orders for my skirmishers to press forward, and will report again as soon as I have positive information.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. RODES,

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: As far as I can learn the enemy's cavalry seem to have halted at Haw's Shop and Aenon Church. I am moving down from this place to Atlee's, where I expect to join with General Hampton, and think that we will have force enough to check any cavalry demonstration the enemy might make. I have heard of no infantry yet, but have made such arrangements as will insure me speedy intelligence of any move on their part, I hope.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FITZ. LEE,

Major-General.
