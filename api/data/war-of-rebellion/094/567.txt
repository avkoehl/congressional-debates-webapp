PADUCAH, KY., January 11, 1865-10 a. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

I shall start up the Tennessee to-day, and can assemble Schofield's corps by the end of this week, either at Clifton or Eastport. If I receive no further orders from you I will direct Schofield to proceed to Annapolis, Md., as expeditiously as possible. The information I get here confirms the report of Colonel Palmer that Hood has gone to Tuscaloosa and that Forrest is somewhere about Okolona with his main force.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
