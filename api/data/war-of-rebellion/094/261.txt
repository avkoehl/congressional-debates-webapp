STEVENSON, December 18, 1864-6.30 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

Dispatch of 2 a. m. received. Will immediately set about putting it in execution. Have for the work 1,400 infantry and 500 cavalry. Roddey with his command occupy Decatur; has six pieces of artillery. Does your orders mean to attack Decatur? I cannot possibly have more than 1,000 men to do it, but will try it, if you so. Roddey will have quite as men, and probably twice as many inside.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, In the Field, December 18, 1864.

Brigadier General R. S. GRANGER,Stevenson:

Yours received. Move as far as you can toward Decatur and open railroad for General Steedman, who is going to same point, and who, when he joins you, will assume direction of affairs.

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

CHATTANOOGA, TENN., December 18, 1864.

Brigadier General R. S. GRANGER,

Commanding, Stenenson:

General Meagher has ordered 800 men form Bridgeport to you. Captain Forrest has been requested, in the name of General Thomas, to co-operate with you. Transports will be at once sent to Bridgeport, there to load with rations as ordered by General Thomas. Do you prefer Caperton's Ferry to Bridgeport? The order is given for Bridgeport, unless you designate the other point.

SOUTWARD HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, December 18, 1864.

Brigadier General R. S. GRANGER,Commanding Department of Northern Alabama:

GENERAL: Major-General Steedman, commanding District of the Etowah, has been ordered to effect the destruction of the rebel bridges at Tuscumbia, and the major-general commanding the department desires that you will co-operate with him in this move by re-enforcing him with all the troops you can spare form the garrison of Decatur, and by throwing supplies into Decatur by steam-boat from Chattanooga. It will probably require but a very small force to defend Decatur against any force the enemy will be able to send against it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
