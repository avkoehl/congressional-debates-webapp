HEADQUARTERS SIXTH DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS, MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Pulaski, Tenn., March 30, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel R. W. SMITH,

Commanding Sixteenth Illinois Cavalry:

I have telegraphed already for you to come in as soon as you can collect your men. The general says you may leave twenty men and an officer, if you think it advisable, to pick up horses, but the general expresses doubt as to the probability. Your receipts for horses must be taken up here. One man may bring them all, bringing in evidence of loyalty of holders. You can give him a pass by the picket, but not by rail.

Very respectfully, yours,

E. T. WELLS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
