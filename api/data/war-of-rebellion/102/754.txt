Major General JOHN POPE:

Colonel Potter, chief quartermaster, submitted the estimate for corn called for to supply General Connor to the Quartermaster-General on the 22nd; telegraphed him the 29th; he got no answer. It requires 500,000 bushels. The contracts should be let as soon as possible. Would it not be well for you to telegraph about it? Time with us now is everything.

Respectfully,

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
