HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FOURTH ARMY CORPS,December 10, 1864-1.10 p.m.

General JOHN W. TURNER:

I can't yet determine what is the force which moved down the Darbytown road. One of Kershaw's brigades came, but what other troops I don't know. Heckman reports slight skirmishing on his front. On Devens' front the enemy doubled their pickets this morning, but have since reduced them to the usual number. Signal Hill and Camp Holly have been re-enforced, and the line connecting Camp Holly with the Deep Bottom line, is manned by about 500 of Kautz's men. I wrote to Heckman that he need not send a whole brigade, but only strong regiment to Jourdan. Is General Ord at department headquarters?

In the Field, December 10, 1864-1.25 p.m.

General TERRY,

Twenty-fourth Army Corps:

General Ord is on the way to your headquarters. A battery of artillery is on the way from Bermuda to report to Jourdan; also a strong regiment and battery from Heckman.

JNumbers W. TURNER,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FOURTH ARMY CORPS,December 10, 1864-6.40 p.m.

General ORD:

The report that the enemy are intrenching near the Johnson house is confirmed by a report which I have just received from General Hawley. He reports that they are on the further side of the field. Everything is quiet, except that there is a little picket-firing in the slashing between the Signal Hill and Camp Holly redoubts. I respectfully suggest that General Kautz should keep Colonel Spear's cavalry during the night at the point on the New Market road where they have been during the day.

ALF. H. TERRY,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES,December 10, 1864-6.50 p.m.

General TERRY:

Look to your ammunition, and have plenty ready early to-morrow morning, when it may be wanted.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

(Same to Brigadier-General Heckman.)
