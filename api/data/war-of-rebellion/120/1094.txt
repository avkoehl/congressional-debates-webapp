the articles. My application for straw, put in October 21, for beds, is not filled yet, and the patients are compelled to lie on the floor. My application for caldron, stovepipe, and cover for washing purposes, put in on the 5th and 16th of September, was finally filled October 28. I was ordered to feed patients in quarters, and yet my requisition for cooking utensils came back disapproved. When the sick were sent from here for exchange I received no official information, nor wass advised in reference to the matter. I was informed by a captain of the examining board, in the original examination, not to send those who were unable to travel. I wass totally ignorant whether the journey would exceed two or three days, only as I judged from the number of days' rations required, viz, two; although the day for forwarding prisoners' returns was the day before the prisoners started, October 11, and mine went in promptly. I did not receive my supplies, and the patients were sent off without coffee or sugar. The train started without reporting to the medical officer, and before the nursers were assigned, blankets distributed, and many had been fed after a fast of more than twelve hours. I was ordered to appoint a given number of nurses and doctors, and my application for an increased number received no attention. A camp inspector is appointed who takes the liberty of entering my wards at all times, instructs my ward-masters and nurses, finds fault to them of my management, and quizzes them in regard to the medical officers. Medical officers have complained that he changes the beds of the patients, corrects and changes their diet, directs the washing of my wards without regard to my rules, orders pneumonia patients with blisters on their sides bathed, &amp;c. I have entered a written protest without avail. I cannot be held responsible for a large medical department of over 1,000 patients without power, authority, or influence. Our post is without a medical representative, and as senior medical officer of this post the whole administrate duties should be intrusted to my care, when it would be hoped that the interest of the sick would be consulted.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. F. SANGER,

Surgeon, U. S. Volunteers, in Charge.
