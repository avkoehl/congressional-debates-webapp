The following letter exhibits estimated effect
of the reductions proposed by the Secretary of
tht Treasury:
Treasury Department, January 22,1855.
Sir: Inclosed is the draft of a bill to reduce the tariff.
This draft, taking the importations of 1853 as the criterion,
including tbe effect of the reciprocity treaty, would raise
from customs, m round numbers, .$45,COO.OUO. The reve-
nue from customs jn 1854 exceeded that of 1853 about
t6,500,000. The receipts of the first six months of the
aca) year 1855, up to the 1st of Januaty, js about
$4,500,000 less than that of 1,854; and if Uie next six
months, up to the 30th June, 1855, shall be reduced at the
same rate, the reduction for the year will be $9,000,000,
and the receipts of 1855 less than those of 1853, near
$3,000,000; but as the bill, if passed, will not take effect
Until after the 30th of June, l«55, the reduced imports of
1855 would not affect the receipts under the reduction.
Tho reduction will operate upon the importations of the
fiscal year, 1856, which, in all probabihiy, irom present in-
dications, will equal the importations of 1853; say that the
receipts of 1856 may be calculated at $43,000,000, under
this bill.
1 have the honor to be, very respectfully,
JAMBS CJUTHIUE,Secretary of the TVcctfury.
Hon. R. M. T. Hunter,
Chairman Committee on Finance, United States Senate.

Mr. BENJAMIN. I do not rise to discuss this
bill. 1 propose to do that a little later in the day,
or to-morrow, or the next day. I rise now to ask
one or two questions of the honorable chairman
of the Committee on Finance, [Mr. Huntkh,]
who has taken upon himself the defense of the
bill and of this innovation upon legislation, much
to the surprise of those who thought they knew
him best. I wish, I say, to put one or two in*
quiries to him, with the view of correcting a mis-
apprehension, if 1 entertain it, or of setting him
right if he is in error. In his statement in relation
to the details of the tariff part of the bill, I under-
stood him to say that it comprised only two prin-
ciples, or two main features; one a diminution by
one fifth of the general rate of duties now placed
upon importations into the country; and theother
a transfer of certain articles in an unmanufactured
state, from certain schedules to lower schedules.
I understood him to say that that was the general
scope of the bill.
Mr. HUNTER. I did not confine the transfer
to unmanufactured articles. I said a few articles
of dye-stufFs.
Mr. BENJAMIN. I wish to ask the honora-
ble Senator for what reason all the textile fabrics
of New England ave raised from lower to higher
schedules?
Mr. HUNTER. I am not aware that such is
the fact.
Mr. BENJAM IN. If the Senator is not aware
of the fact there comes back in full force the con-
r\rfD0n Ur/?e(i m? fnend Maryland,
[LVLr. Fearce,} that the very committee that re-
ported the bill does not know what is in it.
Mr. HUNTER. Can the Senator find an in-
stance m which there is such a transfer from a
lower to a higher rate ?
Mr. BENJAMIN. Here is one clause of the
bill:
" That the following natned articles, embraced in sched-
ule I) of the said act of 31st July, 1846 be, and they are
hereby transferred to schedule C."
That is from a lower to a higher schedule-
Mr. HUNTER. Yes; and schedule D was
twenty-five per centum under the old act, and
schedule C is twenty-four under the new. Ia not
that a reduction ? "
Mr. BENJAMIN. The Senator from Virginia,
cannot get out of the difficulty rn that way; for I
shall prove in a moment, by a comparison of the
clauses of this bill, that, under the pretense of
reducing the duties upon all fabrics throughout the
country, upon all manufactured articles, at tha
same rate, the textile fabrics of New England
recover the amount thus reduced by being changed
from a lower to a higher schedule. Let me read
again the clause which I have already read, and
then go a little further on:
"The following named articles, embraced mschedule D
of the said act of 31st July, 1846, be, and they are hereby,
transferred to schedule C, to wit
Remember, that is to a higher schedule.
" Manufactures and articles of silk, or of which silk
shall be a component material."
That is a transfer from D to C. What next?
" That the manufactures and articles of flax, or of which
flax ahull be a component material, and blankets of all
kinds, embraced in schedule E of the said act of 31st July,
18-16, be transferred to schedule D."
You first begin by taking the entire manufac-
tures of the country, and reducing them all, as
you state, upon the same ratio, in the same way,
to the same extent, and then you fix 
Mr. HUNTER. I am sure the Senator from
Louisiana does not wish to fall into an error. He
cannot find a single article which, under this pro-
posed tariff, will pay more duty than is paid under
the existing one.
Mr. BENJAMIN. That is not the point.
The point is, that you first pretend, by the bill,
to reduce all articles on the same scale, and then
you except out of that general provision certain
favored articles. Now, I wish to know upon
what ground this special protection is given to
these special manufactures.
Mr. HUNTER. If the Senator thinks that
silk is a special manufacture of New England, I
assure him that it is not treated so by those who
are acquainted with the subject.
Mr. BENJAMIN. How about flax and wool?
Mr. HUNTER. Yery little flax is manufac-
tured, and wool is transferred to a reduced
schedule.
Mr. BENJAMIN. Here are blankets in the
scale next to silk.
Mr. HUNTER. Blankets are five per cent,
lower than that, and they will pay no more duty
under this than they do now.
Mr. BENJAMIN. They pay no more duty,
because the duty is reduced upon all, but then you
raise the scale to compensate for the diminution.
I want to know why these special manufactures
are chosen out as objects of the peculiar favor of
the finance Committee—why, after having been
once stricken down to the same rate as all the
other manufactures through the country, thesppar-
ent reduction thus created is overcome again by
transferring them to a higher scale; thus, in point
of fact, excepting them from the reduction that
strikes every other article in the country?
Mr. HUNTER. Does the Senator desire an
answer now ?
Mr. BENJAMIN. Certainly.
Mr. HUNTER. ^Blankets are left at twenty
per cent.,and other manufactures of wool at twen-
ty-five. They are still better off than other man-
ufactures of wool.
Mr. BENJAMIN. Then, if I understand the,
benatorfrom Virginia, he has gone into the details
of the tariff, and taken out special articles which
he thinks ought to be excepted from the general
opfJatl?" °4^r.£edu?tion of twenty per cent.
Mr. HUNTER. 1 stated that there were some
transfers. They are not numerous.
Mr. BENJAMIN. Let us go on with this ex-
amination of the principle upon which the tariff
is to be reduced as regards these particular north-
ern textile fabrics. The Committee on Finance
Which reported the bill has not been satisfied with
taking the manufactures of these textile fabrics
and transferring them from a lower to a higher
