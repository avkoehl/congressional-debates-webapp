HEADQUARTERS SIXTH AND NINETEENTH CORPS,July 22, 1864.

General EMORY:

GENERAL: In reply to your note I have to say that I know nothing in regard to the disposition to be made of either corps, the orders I have simply ordering me to bring the force at once to Washington on being satisfied that the enemy was actually retreating toward Richmond. But I do know the necessity for some time to rest and supply my own corps, as well as yours, and I have already represented it in a dispatch sent to Washington yesterday. You can do much toward the necessary refitting by an early return to the city, and there will be no objection to your doing so. I wish to see the command in camp some three miles from here to-night, and then propose starting for Washington, and shall be happy to have you
