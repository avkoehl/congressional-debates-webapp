the substitute because I do not consider that there j
is any information before the House which will
warrant its action in that direction:
For the expenses of a commission to examine and re-
port upon the management of the several United States
Armories the sum of >&5X000 ; and the Secretary ot v\ nr is
hereby authorized to appomtthree persons, civilians, whose
duty it shall be to report to the next Congress a detailed
statement of the cost of manufacture of arms at said arse-
nals, and recommend any change in the system ot manage-
ment which in theirjudgment may be required by the public
interest.
Mr. Chairman, the amendmentproposed by the
gentleman from Indiana contemplates a change
from the military to the civil superintendency. In
the remarks which I have heretofore submitted to
the committee, I undertook to show, that so far as
there was any evidence before the House, it went
to sustain the efficiency of the military superin-
tendency. 1 propose now to make some addition
to the facts which I exhibited upon that occasion.
I find, on referring to the report of the Commit-
tee on Military Affairs, made on the 13th day of
August, 1852, that it contains the following state-
ment as to the mode in which the armories were
managed under the civil supervision. It says:
" A reference to the consecutive annual reports made to
Congress for many years, will show that during the entire
period that these manufactories were under the manage-
ment of persons so selected, the highest testimony is uni-
forunly borne, by the Departments to which they were
responsible, to the vigor and efficiency of the system then
existing, to the eeneral economy of their management, to
the order and subordination prevalent in them, and to the
gratthnig and increasing improvement in the machinery
used, and in the excellence of the fire arms fabricated there.
Contentment and order prevailed among the operatives;
permanent residences were acquired by the intelligent me*
chanics there employed; and active zeal was manifested
for the public interests, and mechanical skill and ingenuity
stimulated to its highest point, from which the Government
has received inappreciable benefits. These manufactories
have been, since 1815, under the supervision and control of
the Ordnance Department."
That is the language in which the Committee
on Military Affairs spoke of the civil superin-
tendence, and the results achieved under it. I do
not mean to attack the civil superintendence, but
I propose to show that if it is entitled to these
compliments, it would be aifficult to measure the
amount of praise to which the military superin-
tendence is entitled.
1 take facts as I find them, and I will first refer
to the economical part of this subject. In the
year 1822 a musket of the old pattern was pro-
duced at the Springfield Armory for $11 50, and
in 1839, the last year in which muskets of the old
pattern were made, it was produced at a cost of
♦11 79. There were some slight fluctuations of
cost in the years intervening between 1822 and
1839, and in the last year there was a slight in-
crease in the cost at which the old musket was
produced.
In 1840 the new model was introduced, and.the
cost of the muskets that year, under civil super-
intendence, was $17 44. The cost rose at once,
although most of the muskets manufactured that
year were of the old model, some five or six dol-
lars. For reasons, however, which it is unneces-
sary to go into, I do not rely on the cost for the
year 1840 as a basis of comparison.
In 1841 the changeof superintendence was made,
and in April of that year Colonel Ripley, the pres-
ent superintendent, took the charge of the Spring-
field itrmory. He made no changes of any im-
portance until after September, 1841, which was
the close of the fiscal year. During that year,
partly under his superintendence, but actually un-
der the rules and labor tariff of the civil system,
the cost of the musket was j}16 53. I then as-
sume, and I believe it cannot be contradicted, that
when the military superintendent came there, the
settled cost of the musket, under the civil superin-
tendence, from which superintendence the com-
mittee say the Government received inappreciable
benefits, was $16 53. More than ten years have
since elapsed. Now, during the seventeen years
which preceded-that time, with all the improve-
ments in machinery claimed by the committee,
and all the energy which it is said that the civil
superintendency exhibited, the cost of the musket
of the old model not only did not diminish, but
slightly increased. During the last year of the
practical operation of the civil system, after the
machinery had been completed and the new labor
tariff established for the new musket, the cost of
manufacturing the musket was $16 53. I now
take the subsequent ten years, in which the mili-
tary superintendence has been in operation, and I
find that the cost of manufacturing muskets has
been reduced from $16 53 down to $8 75—a dim-
inution of just about one half.
The following statement, taken from official re-
urns, illustrates what 1 have said;
Statement of the annual cost of the musket, at the Spring-
field Armory, from 1822 to 1851, inclusive, taken from the
ojficial returns.

18-23  11 45 1838  II 84
182 4  11 27 1839  11 79

182 6  10 47 1841  16 53
182 7  10 49 1842  13 58
182 8  10 50 1843  13 26 j
182 9  10 02 1844  11 76

1815  10 93 1850  9 03
1836   11 07 1851  8 75
I say, then, that if the civil superintendency
which, in the seventeen years, made no change in
the cost of manufacturing muskets, or if any
change, a change in the wrong direction, is enti-
tled to the credit which the Military Committee
awards to it, how much more is the military super-
intendency entitled to credit for having diminished
the cost one half.
Mr. McNAIR. Did it not cost a great deal to
make the tools with which to manufacture the
new muskets, and did not that greatly increase
the cost of their production under the last years of
the civil superintendency ?
Mr. DAVIS. I have no doubt that that is true
for the year 1840; but I take the general fact, that
from 1822 (town to 1839, the old muskets, which
really were worth five dollars less than the new, cost
from $11 50 to $11 79; and the gentleman should
remember, that in 1841, after the new tools and ma-
chinery had been constructed, the cost of the new
muskets was $16 53, and that fact cannot be gain-
sayed. But in eleven years, the cost was brought
down to $875. Now, hpw was that done? Ifithad
been done by reducing the wages of the workmen
below a living price, it might have been said that it
was such a saving as was unworthy of this Gov-
ernment to make. But it was not so. They were
required to work only ten hours a day, while
workmen in other establishments were required
to work twelve hours a day; and it is a fact that
the average sum earned by the Springfield work-
men has been a little more, for the last ten years,
than the average under the old system; for they
earned on the average, $37 87 per month on the
old system, and have earned an average of $38 84
per month on the new system. So that in the
most essential particular, of compensation, the
workmen are as well off as they were before,
while the Government has made these enormous
savings.
I call the attention of the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania, [Mr. McNair,] who talks about the ex-
pense of the manufacture of new tools, to the fact,
that the difference of the cost of labor bestowed
upon a musket, under the civil superintendence,
as compared with the present cost, is $3 83 on
each musket.
That result has been obtained mainly in two
modes—one is by improvements in machinery,
and the other by savings in labor, by requiring
that the workmen should labor during the ten
hours per day for which they are paid. There
were, at the time the military superintendent came
there, workmen who, by working ten hours a
day, at the prices then paid, might have earned
$7 99 per day, and those very workmen, by labor-
ing ten hours under the present tariff of prices,
can earn $3 83 per day.
The fact is, that under the old system, many of
the workmen labored but from three to six and
seven hours a day, and in many instances it would
appear that they did not work the full extent of
time, because they could earn a good day's wages
without doing so. Now, these things needed re-
form. I care not what general praises are be-
stowed upon the civil system; I take the simple
facts, that for seventeen years before the military
superintendency went into operation, there had
been no reduction in the cost of manufacturing
muskets, and that two years before that time, the
cost all at once ran up five or six dollars; that
when the military system came in, they cost
$16 53, and in ten or eleven years, that cost was
reduced about one half, as evidence enough of the
efficiency of the economy with which that estab-
lishment has been managed.
Mr. McNAlR. A gentleman from my district
has informed me that it costs $1,500 to make the
tools before they could make a single musket.
Mr. DAVIS. 1 do not know how that is, but
the gentleman will see, upon examination and cal-
culation, that if he will leave out of view the year
1840, when the cost of manufacturing a musket
was $17 44, and when these tools were made, and
come to the year 1841, after the tools were made
and in full operation, the cost of a musket to the
Government was still $16 53.
Mr. McNAIR. I have been trying to get $14 75
a musket for a friend of mine in Montgomery
county, and I cannot obtain it.
Mr. DAVIS. That is to say you have been
trying to get the Government to pay $14 75 for
muskets, and six dollars more than they cost at
Springfield. Why should the Government pay
that, when it can make them for $8 75? I pre-
sume the gentleman's friend would be glad to have
the system changed.
Mr. McNAIR. They were not made for that
sum for several years.
Mr. DAVIS. It formerly cost sixteen or sev-
enteen dollars, up to the time the change was made;
and this superintendent has succeeded in reducing
the expense to $8 75.
I will now refer to the testimony of Mr. Pom-
roy, a highly-respectable gentleman, an inhabitant
of Pittsfield, who used to manufacture arms for
the Government on contract. In 1844 he testified
as follows:
" I have examined muskets this morning, and I can ray
that there is a general improvement in them from 1840 to
1844. I think there has been a decided improvement in
model, and material, and workmanship. The improve-
ments have progressed more rapidly from year to year since
Major Ripley has been there than before. The work has
beeu better done since Major Ri|;ley has been here than be-
fore he came."
In answer to a question as to the effect of Ma-
jor Ripley's administration upon his armory, he
says:
" It has destroyed the whole capital for me. 1 own an
armory which cost me $30,000, and it is not now worth, for
making arms, anything to me, which would not have beeu
the case, I think, if a civil superintendent had been here."
He also says:
" My workmen for twenty years past have complained
that at the United States armory they got much better wages
for less work than tht-y did at my armory."
1 There were one hundred and forty-eight thou-
sand seven hundred and ninety-three muskets made
within the last twelve years. At the stated price
of 1840, which was the last year of the unmixed
civil superintendency, that quantity of muskets
would have cost $2,594,000. It has actually cost
$1,660,000, making a difference of $934,000. If
you adopt the price of 1841 as a basis, which is
| undoubtedly fairer, the difference is still nearly a
million of dollars saved to the Government.
| I have heard a great deal about economy in
I this House. I hear it every day, and it does me
| good to hear such good talking on the subject as
i we sometimes get here. But Colonel Ripley has
| carried out what our speech-makers theorize about.
I He has saved on a grand scale enough to pay five
j times over for all the time we have wasted here.
; Nor do I admit that he can be justly charged with
extravagance for expenditures upon buildings.
. The new buildings which have been erected there
: are doubtless noble pieces of architecture: plain,
massive, firm as the hills, of the very btst ma-
; terial, calculated to last for centuries, and to illus-
j trate the completeness and thoroughness of those
! who planned and built them. But not one of
j those buildings was erected without the order of
' his official superiors of the Democratic party, and
not a dollar has been expended but can be satis-
I factorily accounted for.
j It may be said that the economic changes made
by Colonel Ripley would have taken place at any
rate; that in any event, and under any system,
| the cost of the musket would inevitably have been
; reduced by reason of improved machinery and
< reduced cost of materials. The answer to that
suggestion is, that in it, during the seventeen last
years of the civil superintendency, no such reduc-
tions occurred in price, and that the price of arms
gradually increased. It was perfectly obvious,
then, that reform was needed; for the Govern-
ment, the best paymaster in the country, had to
pay more for arms than private individuals.
Mr. CARTTER. I wish to submit a question
