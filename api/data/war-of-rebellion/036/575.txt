Vicksburg, April 29, 1863.

The line to Grand Gulf is broken. Heavy firing in that direction, under the circumstances, has induced me to start a re-enforcement.

Eight boats, loaded with troops from our front, are now moving up Yazoo. The display made in moving them showed a desire to attract our attention.

Number 4. Reports of Brigadier General John S. Bowen, C. S. Army. GRAND GULF, April 29, 1863.

Six gunboats, averaging ten guns, have been bombarding my batteries terrifically since 7 a. m. They pass and repass the batteries at the closest ranges. I cannot tell the effect of our shots. Six transports in sight, loaded with troops, but stationery. My loss as yet only 2 killed. The batteries, especially the lower ones, are badly torn to pieces. I cannot tell the result, but think that re-enforcements would hardly reach me in time to aid in the defense if they attempt to land.

JNO. S. BOWEN,

Brigadier-General.

General PEMBERTON.

GRAND GULF, April 29, 1863.

After six hours and a half of continued firing, the gunboats have retired. They fired about 3,000 shot and shell, temporarily disabling one gun. Our loss is 3 killed and 12 or 15 wounded. Apparently we injured two of their boats; damage unknown. Colonel William Wade, of the artillery, one of the bravest and best of my command, was killed at his post.

The men behaved like veterans (as they are), and are now hard at work preparing for another attack.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON.

GRAND GULF, April 29, 1863.

One disabled gunboat, after endeavoring unsuccessfully to go up the river, now lies about 3 miles below, by the Louisiana shore.
