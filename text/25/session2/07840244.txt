Senate.
n°htto construe finally and conclusively (he ex-
tent of its own pow ts, and to enforce it  construc-
tion at ihe point of ihe bayonet, doctrines which,
at a blow, sweep away every vestige of State
Rights and reduce the States to mere petty and
dependent corporations It would have also
brought in his policy, bank, tariff, and all Even
now, when victoiv is unceitain, the Senator an-
nounces ihe approach of the period when he shall
move the ltnewal oi the protective system, a pre-
cious contesMon, that dropped out in the heat of
discussion
f All  Wfbstpr    No, I spoke deliberately ]
So much, then, the «orse That justifies all I
ha\e said md done, th it proves my foresight and
firmness, and mil open the ejes of thousands,espe-
enlly in the South, who hive heietofore doubted
the eonectness of my couise on this question
The victory would not only have been complete
had I co operated, but it would also have been
permanent The portion of the State Rights party,
with which I acted, would hate been absorbed—
yi s, absorbed, it ts the proper word, and I use it in
spilt of ihe sarcasm of the Senatoi The other
\ ould have been scattered and deslrojed, and the
Senator and his party, and their principles and po-
licy, would have been left undisputed masteis of
the field, unresisted and irresistible The lirst
if tuts of the victory would have been the re-union
of tht pi ¡meal and money power—a wedded union
ncur morí to be dissolved The tanfl wouldhave
been le tewed—I may now speak positively, after
the declat ítion ol the Senator—to be again follow'-
i I bv an overflowing revenue, proiuse and corrupt
<xpi n liturcs, heavy surplus, and oveiK helming pa-
iro*age, which would have closed the doors to
'-eilth md distinction to all who refused to bend
the kmcu the shnneo! the combined powers All
this was soon and fullj comprehended by the Sena
toi, and hence again, 1 repetí, Ins deep grief, his
keendi ippomtimnt, and his attacks on me, (or
r< fusing to co-opeiate
The Senator must have known that, 111 refusing,
I ailed on principles and opinions long entertained
and lully deolaied year* ago In my reply to his
a sooiate in this joint war on me, in which I am
attacked Pi nice in front and rear, I demonstrated,
to the s-tisfaction rf the Senate, the truth of what
I tsseit, so eunpletelv, thai the ¡Senator's associate
0  d no' vi 11 itl "inpt d denial And jet, such is
ihe depth ol the Senator's gru f and disappointment,
that it humid him to a repetition o( exploded
charges v huh 111 his cooler moments, he must
know to bt unfounded He repeated the stale and
lefulid charge of a summerset, of going over, and
of being struck with a sudden thought, and sum-
moned up .ill his powers of irony and declama-
tion, of which he proved himself to he agreatmas
tcr <n the occasicn, to make my Edgefield leitei,
111 which I assigned my reason for refusing to co.
1 perate ridiculous I see in all this but the disap-
pointed hopis of one who had fixed his ga/e in-
te 1 ely on power that had eluded his gra p, and
who sougl t to wreak his resentment on him who
hid lelused to put the splendid prize in his. hands
lie resorted to ridicule because it was the Only
ncapon thil tiuth and justice left him He well
knows h iw much deeper are the wounds that they
inflict thin the slight punctures that the pointed,
but in ble, shafts of ridicule kave behind, and he
us°d the more harmless weapon only because hr
couH not conmand the more deadly That is in
my hand I blandish 11 in his eyes It is the only
one I need, and I intend to use it freely on this
oecasii n
Aftei pouring out his wailing in such doleful
tone , because I wild not co operate in placing
nm 'til his n uiv in pouei, and prostrating my
uw 11, the Senator next attacks me because I stated
111 mv I 'gefield letter, as I understood him, that 1
1 allied 111 G Mieral Tackson, with the Mew ol put-
1 ng dow n the tariff by Executive influence I have
looked rvei that let'er with care, and can find no
such expression
[Mi Wfbster It was u«ed at the extri ses-
„kn]
I was about to add that I had often used it, and
cannot hut feel oitrprised that the Senator should
postpone the notice of 11 till this late period, if he
thought it deserving reply Why did he not reply
to it years ago, when I first used u in debate? But
the Senator asked what I meant by Executive in-
fluence Did I mean his v eto? He must have
asked the question thotightlesslj He must know
that the veto can only apply 10 bills on their pas-
sage, and could not possibly fee used in case of
existing laws, such as the taiitT acts He also
asked if there was concert in putting down the uuiff
between raj self and the present Chief Magistrate'
I reply by asking him a qoesmn, to which, asa
New England man, he cinuot object He has
avowed his determination,in aceitamcontingency
which he thinks is neai, that he will move the tc-
newal of the tariff Iask,isthen coin it on tint
point, between hi 111 and his asv uaie in this att.u W
And finally, he asks if I disclosed rov motivts
then? Y s I am not in thi habit of disguising
them I openly and constantly av owed that it w is
one of my leading motives m supporting Geneial
Jackson, because I expected he would use his in-
fluence to efTeei a gradual, bin thoi nigh, reduction
of the tanfl, that would reduce the sjstem to the
revenue point, and when 1 saw leason to doubl
whether hi would accomplish what I deem so im-
portant, I did not >Mit the ewnt ol his election, hut
111 vied openh and boldly in luvor of State interpo-
sition, as a cut 111, reined), «Inch would not tail to
tflict the reduction, in the eve the should disap-
point me
The Senator, after despatching my lettei, con-
cluded his speech  b;   volunteeiing a  cimpanson
between his and my ¡ ablic th 11 icier, not verv Mat-
tel tug to mc, bin highly complimentary to himself

piessne optrilu ti'u!  I In 1 mil, which   he thought

conception, nothing cm be moie piinfnl than to
pronounce our own praise, pirticularly in contri'I
with another, even when foiced to do so in self-d -
fence, but how one can  use  111  his  place, when
neither his motive nor ooiduct is nope ichcd, and
when there is nothing m toe question, 01 pievions

nouncean eulcwy on himself, witch a modest mm
would blush to pronounce on a Washington or a
franklin 10 his l ice, is 10 me utteily incomprehen-
sible     But, if the Senator, in pronouncing his gor-
geous piece of autobiogiaphv, had contented him-
self in simply proclaiming, in his deep tone, to the
Senate ami the assembled mullitute  ol  spectators,
that he came into  Congre"s  as  the representative
ol the Amenein people,  that, if he was born for
any goo I, it was lor Ihe good of the whole people,
and the defence of   the  Constitution, that he habi-
tual!} acted as it   actm" in the eyes oí the framers
of the Constitution  th it it w 01111 be eisier to drive
these pilláis from the 11   bises, tinn to diive or se

would have ga/ed in  >il<iit vvondei, without uttei-
ing a word, at ihe extraordinary spectacle, md the
hippy self-del us on m  which  he seems to exist
But whe n he vmd nook not only to erect an image
to himscif, is in  oljict of self adoration, but to
plac alongsi le e f it 1 carved ligure of myself, with
distuned Imw  -"id le nures, to heighten and rendei
more divine his  o   n   image, he  invited, he ch il-
lengeel, rut, he  compelled me to inquire into the
high qualities which he  arrogates to  himself, and
the tniih of the comparison which he 1 cs diawn be-
tween us     It the lrqtnry   should excite  some re-
miniscences not very  agrcable  to the  Senitor, or
disturb the happ) self   f lusioum whicn he repose s,
he mint blame not me, but his own self-sufpciency
md boasting at mj expense
Know youisclt, is an ancient m 1x1m, the wis
dom of which I never befoie so fully realised
How imperfectly even the talented and intelligent
know   themselves1   Our understanding, like our
eyes, seems to be given.uol to see our own features,
but those of others.   How diffident we ought to be
of any favorable opinion that we may have formed
of ourselves'   That one of the distinguished abili-
ties of the Senatoi, and his mature age, should
form so erroneous an opinion of his real charac-
ter, is indeed truly astonishing    I do not deny lhat
he possesses many excellent qualities    lV[y object
istiuth, and I intend neither to exaggerate nor de-
li ae 1     But 1 must sjj , thai the charactet which he
attributes, to himself is wholly dissimilar from what
it illy belong* to him     So far from that umvesrsal
and ardent pi'notism which  knows neither place
ne 1 jierson   that he ascrrhes to himself,be is, above
ill the distinguished ¡uiblic men with whom I am
acquainted, retnirkable foi  a devoted attachment
to the inteiest, the institutions, and the place where
IN evidence has cast his lot     I do not censure him
loi his local feelings    The Author of our being
neve! intended that creatures of our limited faculties
should embrace, with equal intenseness of affection,
the 1 emote and the near  Sue h an organization would
lead as constantly to mtei meddle with what we
would but lmpeifectly understand, and often to do
mischief wheie we intended good    But the Sena-
toi is lar from being liable to such a charge    His
'flections, instead oi being too wide and boundless,
aic too concentrated   As local as his attachment is,
it docs not embrace all within its limited scope    It
takes in but a class even there—a powerful, influ-
ential, and intelligent, but still a class which influ-
ences and controls all his actions, and so absorbs
his affections as to make him overlook laige poi-
tions of the Union, of which I propose to give one
01 two striking illustrations
I must then remind the Senator that there is a
vast extent of our wide-spread Union, w'sich lies
south ol Mason and Dixon's line, distinguished by
it pee uiiar s ni, e Innate, ■■ tu Uion, institutions, and
piod lotions, w h ch he his never encircled within
1 e wmn mbriccs of his universal piirioüsm As
I ing is he his leen in jubito lile, he has not, to
the list oi my knowledge, given 1 single vote lo
promote 11-, inteiest, 01 dine an act to defend i's
lights 1 wish not to do htm injustice If I could
u'nember a single instance I would cite it, but I
cannot, in casting my eyes ovei his whole course,
oil to mind one As boundless and ardent, then,
as is his patriotism, iccouling to his own aacouut,
it turns oat that ills limited by metes and bounds
that exclude nearly one half of the whole Union'
But it may be said that this total absence of all
m mifestaiion of attachment to an entire section of
the union is not to be attributed to the want of an
ardeni desire to promote us interest and security,but
oí occasion to exhibit it Unfortunately for the
Senator, such an excu-e would be without founda-
tion Opportunities are daily and hourly ottering
The section is the weakest of any, and its pecu-
liar interest and institutions expose it constantly to
injustice and oppression, which afford many and
line opportunities to disptaj that generous and no-
ble pdüiottsm which the Senator attributes to him-
seli, and which delights in taking the side of the as-
sailed airim t the assailant Even no'v, at this mo-
me it Ihoie is a 1 oppoitumty which one professing
such 11 lenr mil universil attachment to the whole
ountiy as the Senatoi does, would greedily em-
brace A war is now, anl has been for years,
svstematically and fiercely carried on in violation
of the Constitution, against a long standing and
widely-extended institution of that section, which is
in Impensable, not only to us prosperity, but to its
safety and existence, and which calls loudly on eve-
iv patriot to raí e his voise and arm in its defence
He w has ihe Senator acted? Has he raised his
mighty arm 111 defence of Ihe assailed, or thundered
fonh his d-muicia c n ag-> st the assailants? These
irt seat c in? que tons lh y test the truth of his
umcrsal and busted uuchmeni to the whole
eonniij, and m oidei that the Senate may compare
his acts with his professions, I propose to present
more fully the facts of the case and his course.
It is well known, then, that the section to which
(J I refer is inhabited oy two races, from different con-
tinents, and descended from different stocks, and
that they have existed together under their present
1 elation from the first settlement of the country,   li
