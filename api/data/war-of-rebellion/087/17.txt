No. 1. Report of Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant, U. S. Army, commanding Armies of the United States.*

CITY POINT, VA., August 9, 1864-11.45 a. m.

Five minutes ago an ordnance boat exploded, carrying lumber, grape, canister, and all kinds of shot over this point. Every part of the yard used as my headquarters is filled with splinters and fragments of shell. I do not know yet what the casualties are beyond my own headquarters. Colonel Babcock is slightly wounded in hand and 1 mounted orderly is killed and 2 or 3 wounded and several horses killed. The damage at the wharf must be considerable both in life and property. As soon as the smoke clears away I will ascertain and telegraph you.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
