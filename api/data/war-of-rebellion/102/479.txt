HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF LA FOURCHE,Brashear City, La., May 17, 1865.

Major W. HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Southern Division of Louisiana:

Colonel Fiske, commanding post at Donaldsonville, telegraphs me that Brown surrendered with five of his men as prisoners of war yesterday. Brown said the remainder of his command have gone across Lake Verret to the Terche on their way home. He says that Whitaker and his command have gone to Shreveport, where they have been ordered. My mail courier arrived at Bayou Boeuf at noon to-day on his way here, being now two days and a half out. If the telegraph line should fail us between Bayou Boeuf and Terre Bonne it will take days to get it repaired, such is the difficulty in getting through. Will you please let me known when the Bart Able leaves for this place.

Yours,

R. A. CAMERON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding District.
HEADQUARTERS SOUTHERN DIVISION OF LOUISIANA,New Orleans, La., May 17, 1865.
