Lieutenant-General GRANT,City Point:

All my brigades are carried away by the ice. I have but six days' rations within reach. Bridges may be repaired by to-morrow. Are you aware that by the President's order I sent word yesterday p. m. though General Parke that the three peace commissioners will be met at or [near] where they now are, on General Parke's front, by a messenger from Washington? I presume the negotiations are to be conducted at City Point. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell are Davis' commissioners. Will this affect your order to move?

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
