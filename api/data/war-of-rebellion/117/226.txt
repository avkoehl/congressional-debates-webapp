ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, July 16, 1862.

Captain A. A. GIBSON, Commanding Fort Delaware:

When at Fort Delaware I did not understand that you regarded additional troops as necessary to prevent the escape of prisoners or I would have taken measures to have sent them. To my question whether a guard-boat was not necessary you replied no; you had perfect control over the island. General Wool has been directed to send and additional force to Fort Delaware and a guard-boat will be sent from New York. You must allow no intercourse whatever with the prisoners and keep citizens from landing on the island except those in the employment of the Government, and these must not have any intercourse with the prisoners. If boats came to the island and took the prisoners off your sentinels could not have done their duty.

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

FORT DELAWARE, DEL., July 16, 1862.

General LORENZO THOMAS,

Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.

GENERAL: I sent a telegraph to you this morning announcing the escape of nineteen prisoners of war and asking for additional troops, the guards being now as heavy as physical endurance will permit. Last evening the officer of the day suspected that certain prisoners were plotting to escape and took extra precautions to prevent it. Until midnight the weather was stormy and the darkness unusual. The escape was effected by timbers with which a privy was being constructed on the shore about 400 yards from the quarters by those who made the attempt. The bank at that place is covered with a thick growth of reeds. A partially constructed raft was found this morning which the party undoubtedly were prevented from completing by the patrols. The officers of the post cannot be more vigilant and I hardly think another prisoner will be able to escape. I have exhausted my ingenuity in making the custody of the prisoners complete, but the area to be guarded is too great for the present force.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. A. GIBSON,

Captain, Second Artillery, Commanding.

Since writing the foregoing I have received a telegraph from the Adjutant-General requiring more particulars which have been rendered. By no inquiry can I discover that the sentries were not vigilant. They were posted in the quarters and on the inside and outside of the prisoners' parade around the building. The ventilators give free opportunity to get out from every tier of bunks.

A. A. G.
