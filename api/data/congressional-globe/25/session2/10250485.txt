lidian hostilities—Mr Daioion.
H. of Reps.
What was the consequence' Why, sir, from every
section of the Un ted Stales, and from all parts of
Europe too, people began to gathei there, a more
heterogeneous population were never congiegated
any where, almost every nation and every tongue
were seen and h'ard, they were subject to no law
that could be executed undsr the circumstances
then existing, hence outrages* were constantly com-
mitted there, in violation both o<" me laws of God
and man. The countiv not tein¿ organized, that
region was oven un with d*s o'ute fjreignTs an i
others,  ho hid taken pos es i n oí he gold region
without tbe semblance oí ambonf , ai 1 outrage 1

and exercised all the rights ol absolute owners, s0
far as the use of the soil was involved, commuted
«very trespass, ?ad weie Aeqaen ly on the eve of
•civil commotion among lhems< Ives The laws of
Geoigia could not then be killy executed, because
there were not c t /<ms settled within the country to
aid in their execution
In this state of things, the Gvi <=■ al Ot "rmntnt
attempted the execution of the ' intercourse law,"
and sent a military (orce into the couu.tr), under
the command of a Federal officer, and, sir wnat
was the rc-u fi A ndiculous faice Such weie

they «ere not easily alarmed, th<.y had st ength

That, too, failed of success
Let me ask, was a sovereign State tu peimit such
disorganization? a S'ate which, in all her relations,
m the language of our own Troup, (whose " politi-
cal character and pnncip'es are admired by his
friends, and respected by h s enemies,") " has
evinced a sincere desire to harniont/e with the
Union, to mamta'n peace and tranquility with the
Indnns, until longei f irb>aran e vtou'd cease tobe
a virtue in tact, to Irtid ou* e es as we i ?ve ai-

How could the civil authority of the State be en-
forced, unless the country was organized into coun-

ecute those law <i It was the only course, better than
a mihiarj government, to preserve the peace of the
cruntry, Hence the formation of counties, theirwr-
ganiza* on and settlement by a population, intelli-
gent, obed ent to the law, men ol character and re-
spectability I submit to the country the legisla-
tion of Georgia, and ask an honest companson with
the legislation ot any other State Georgia has

Indians, an 1 her cit zens
I have-often had cause of excitement, if not of
resentment on 'his subject I feel it due to the
S ale I represent, and to myself, in all sincerity
pnd t u'h, and in a sp nt veiy different from vatn
boasting, to say to such gent!emen as have determin-
ed to go against this bill, and the appropnat ons m
it intended to cprry into execu ion the Cheiok e
trea  , and to sustain a military force in the C> e-
rokie counjy, to pi event hostiluies, and to pro <ct
ioe 'ives of oui citizens, that ¡f they are no*- in-
w ilhng '0 do so, and are not satisfied that Georgia
has bet  justified in her couise, and that you n-
tead to tnamt->m Ross and lis ppity against die
trcatv and Wve that Stale tn protect herself, Ay
so \ Qd if th s be \ our object, for one, I \v ill s v,

Then, su, let the gentleman fiom Virginia come
at the head of an arm},  "to cas ¡cite the State,"
I  promise him that he wnl be met the first footpiuit
that he makes on the soil ot Georgia and I shall be
greatly mistaken if he does not find it much easier
and more pleasant to talk here 1a these walls of
castigating a Slate, than to do it Georgia has not
asiedjouto throw your protection around her;
she has asked you to cartj out your tteaty, honest-
Iv to fulfil your compact, to remove the Indians, to
send a force n do it, and prevent them from com-
mitting depredations oa our citizens That Sta'e
un l"rstands her righis, a->d can protect her citi-

law, and by a kind and generous people, and none
are more so than the citizens of the Cherokee ¿coa-
tíes Some of the present •generatiife may con-
demn, but the time will come when the policy and
conduct of Georgia and her people will he appre-
ciated by all; and whenever that time arrives, Í do
not doubt that the unanimous opinion of all unpre-
judiced minds will be, that in the necessary exercise
of her constitutional poweis, the policy of rh«
State has been characterized by a forbearing kind-
ness and enlightened humanity towards a power-
less remnant of an unfortunate! ace.
Mr. Chairman, I will nowiurn my attention for
a short time to some of the geBtlemea who have
preceded me in this debate. I take no pleasure,
sir, in the discussion of matters having little or no
connection with the subject under consideration,
nor should I now do so> bat from an imperious
sense of duty In answer to some remarks I mid?
a few days s nee, on the President's message a'nd
the propositions from the War Department, in rela-
tion to the Cherokee treaty, much -has been said
during this debate.
When that message was communicated and
xead to us I spoke freely. I knew that it wou'd be
productive of ne goed, but, m all probabih'y, wouid
lead to bloodshed*—at leajt to confusion and delay
in the execution or the treaty. And I told the
House if the Government undsrtook to postpone
the citizens of Georgia in taking possession of their
lands, that a conflict between the State Government
ana the General Government vvoul I inevitably en-
sile, for I knew the Governor of Georgia would
execute the laws of that State a,t every hazard, and
that the mtei position was unexpected to me, and
would be so to the people of Georgia, whose Go-
vernor had been notified that the trea'y should be
executed. I ,>No stated that the friends of huma-
nity—ihe real, not the canting hypocrites—had la-
borea day aiter day to induce John Rosí and hi& Che-
rokee delegation to return to his people, and ad-
vise them to remove peaceably , that it was his
daty to do so, and I told him myself, that ever?
misfortune that should fall on ihe Cherokee people,
unless he did return, would be jtii I3 chargeable to
him, for ata word he could remove them in peace
pnd harmony, that by so doing he would subserve
the cause of humanity, and prove to the world t'ie
sircerify of his regard for his people, that by such
conduct he might save the lives of innocent v omen
and children, the lives of the unlettered and igi,c-
nnt among his own people, for the white Indian
would avoid danger. Sir, it is due to ,nat gallant
and patriotic officer, General Scott, whose services
have been required m the execu ion of this treatr,
to =ay, that the night before he left this city he
urged Ross to go with him to the Ch-rokce coTtn-
try—told him it was his duty to do so I w as pre-
sent, and united m the advite Ross iefuied, and
f-mce that period I considered the deierminauun of
Rom> fixed, not to g<, and that n< thing further
would be heard from Ro«s except through General
Scott Both Gereral Scott and mj self held this
language to Ro^s, not on accmu t of an> difiScalUes
he could interpose 11 'he execution of the treaty,
bat exclusively from feelings of humanity for the
poor ignorant and misguided creatures who had
been misled by his ctunse'> Gentlemen have ex-
pressed great gtatification at this sudden inte post,
tioa of the Presiden', and have ronsra'ulated the
cuuntrj that M, Van Buii-n would st ¡y ibe execu-
tion of h  Chirokee 'rtatv, ihat Ihetiea'j a/iou'i not
