HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA, In the Field, July 30, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Have just received a telegram from Foster that all is quiet on his front, and that he will hold his position. No troops have yet passed to Petersburg; might I suggest that as soon as they begin to move if all our batteries and mortars that bear on the bridges should open it might trouble them to get across. How gets on the movement? Nothing has stirred in our front.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,Major-General.

JULY 30, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

We gained a portion of the enemy's line, but cannot hold it. Our men will be withdrawn to-night. The batteries and guns bearing on the bridge will open on the enemy if they attempt to cross.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., July 30, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

I have ordered a corps of infantry and all the cavalry to keep on, now that we are in motion, to cut some fifteen or twenty miles of the Weldon road. Please order Kautz to report to General Gregg, at Lee's Mill, with his cavalry, to-night. Ord's corps, being the only one out of line, will go. They need not take but five days' rations with them. I want to do this damage now, whilst we rest up and prepare for a bigger operation.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
