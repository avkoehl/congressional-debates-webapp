that condition when King's battery leaves. Wright has one of the heavy artillery regiments formerly on that line. May I not replace these light batteries by details of companies from that regiment?

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.

If possible I had rather you would get men elsewhere, as I want to keep Wright's corps ready for the field. Can't enough invalid artillerists be found for this detail? If not, take some from Wright's temporarily.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,July 12, 1864.

Major-General AUGUR:

As the enemy seems to be moving round to our right, I think Forts Mahan and Meigs should be re-enforced. Perhaps the convalescents and employes of the department could be made available for this purpose. General Barnard's attention should be called to the importance of preparing rifle-pits on that line, and to look especially to the gap between Fort Lincoln and Fort Mahan.

FORT RENO, July 12, 1864.

(Received 12 m.)

Major-General AUGUR:

I would suggest that orders to Colonel Wisewell be given to prevent any citizens from approaching our lines. A number have been picked up near the picket-line. I think no man or woman should be allowed to leave Washington or Georgetown without a pass. A few men on the main roads detailed from the provost guard will cover the case.

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff.

FORT STEVENS, July 12, 1864.

(Received 1. 30 p. m.)

Major-General AUGUR:

I think as a precaution the garrisons of Forts Foote and Washington should be increased to guard against any raids in that direction.

J. G. BARNARD,

Brevet Major-General, Chief Engineer.
