HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., April 25, 1865.

Colonel CHESTER HARDING, Jr.,

Commanding District of Central Missouri, Warrensburg, Mo.:

COLONEL: Troops are posted to prohibit guerrillas crossing the Missouri River, to break up bands of guerrillas near place posted. The troops must be kept under strict discipline, and any depredations upon citizens or property will be severely dealt with. They must confine their duty to military matters and not interfere in civil matters. It will also be their duty to carry out the orders in relation to ferries, which will be furnished them.

I have the honor to be, colonel, your obedient servant,

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General, Commanding.

WARRENSBURG, April 25, 1865-10. 40 a. m.

General DODGE:

Two companies of cavalry from Greenton Valley and Chapel Hill are working their way to Marshall, Saline County. One company and part of another have been sent to California, where they arrived last night. Some gangs have been attempting to enter the State through Bates. On the 18th Lieutenant Atkinson with sixteen men pursued and overtook ten; killed six, among whom was Captain W. W. Brinton, of Buchannan County, who had a recruiting commission in his pocket.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, April 25, 1865-12 m.

Colonel HARDING,

Warrensburg:

I send the Fiftieth Wisconsin Infantry from here up the Missouri River to garrison points designated. There are nine companies. At what places shall they be stationed so as to cover crossing places, boats, &c.?

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

WARRENSBURG, April 25, 1865.

General DODGE,

Saint Louis:

I presume there is no danger to boats below Jefferson City. Portland, in Callaway, used to be a bad place. Providence and Rocheport, in Boone County; Arrow Rock, Cambridge, and Miami, in Saline; Waverly, Berlin, Wellington, and Napoleon, in Lafayette, need troops. Brunswick ought to be garrisoned, if it is not, and Glasgow, too. Will write by mail so that orders can intercept the boat at Jefferson City.

CHESTER HARDING, Jr.,

Colonel, &c.
