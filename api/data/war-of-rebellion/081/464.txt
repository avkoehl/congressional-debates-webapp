HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT, June 27, 1864-11 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

We have received from a detachment of the Cavalry Corps on the left, near Reams' Station, a party of contrabands, fifteen in number-men, women, and children. Most of them are from the neighborhood of Reams' Station. Two are from Petersburg, one having left more than a week ago, and the other having left last Saturday. The latter passed clear round the enemy's lines, leaving them to his left as he came. Neither of them give information changing that heretofore reported. They say that General Pickett's provost-marshal has an office in the town; that Beauregard's headquarters are now with General Lee on the Chesterfield side; and that nothing has come within the last week from the direction either of Richmond or Danville. It was understood in Petersburg on Saturday that every connection with Richmond was cut. Prior to the Weldon road being occupied by our forces it was used continually for the transportation of supplies.

Very respectfully,GEORGE H. SHARPE,

Colonel, &amp;c.
