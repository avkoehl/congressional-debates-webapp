Three exploded over the city and one in front and close up to six- gun for tin front of the right of General Geary's division, and one over the works a short distance further to the enemy's left.

General SCHOFIELD:

General Howard's signal officer reports a column of infantry, followed by wagons passing to our right. Do you know whether Kilpatrick is on this side or not! Keep a good lookout in the direction of that road, where we saw the wagons, and report any movements of interest. I think Kilpatrick will make the road at Fairburn.
