could, the guerrillas pursuing, and up to this time, I have only heard of about forty getting into camp. I heard that Major Johnston got to Sturgeon with twenty-five men. Two lieutenants got to Parish with fifteen men.

General FISK:

Major Lyell went up on train to-day to assist in the removal of the dead bodies of our soldiers to this place. While there he was told that General Douglass left Columbia yesterday with about 1,000 men and two pieces of artillery, moving in a northerly and northeasterly direction. I think the rebels are in greatest force in the northwestern part of Callaway; they seem to move in that direction from Centralia. Have no reliable reports of their whereabouts to-day.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MEXICO, September 29, 1864.

General FISK:

Train just down from Sturgeon. Lieutenant-Colonel Draper is at Centralia with 250 men. They have collected the dead bodies from the field and have now 87 dead bodies at Centralia, 17 dead bodies at Sturgeon, and 34 at this place. A citizen in from the country reports at Centralia that he heard cannon in the direction of Fayette to-day, supposed to be General Douglass' command.

HEADQUARTERS,Glasgow, September 29, 1864.

Captain H. S. GLAZE,

Ninth Cavalry Missouri State Militia, Fayette, Mo.:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your dispatches of yesterday. I have nothing important from the North Missouri Railroad. Lieutenant-Colonel Draper is at Centralia waiting intelligence from General Douglass and Major King. I have concluded to assign you to staff duty and make you district inspector, in place of Captain Sharp, whose duties as mustering officer prevent him from making the proper inspections. You will report at Saint Joseph with the least possible delay. I shall not be able to send a train to Fayette until the arrival of additional force from Macon, now en route. If the command get out of rations meantime subsistence will be taken from those who have it in the vicinity of Fayette, and if we are unable to send train by 3rd or 4th proximo start one wagon with fifty men at midnight with instructions to march rapidly to Glasgow. I will re-enforce the escort and return the night following. Let the reliable citizens be called into camp at such time. I have ordered shot, powder, caps, and lead for the citizen soldiers who have mixed arms.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
