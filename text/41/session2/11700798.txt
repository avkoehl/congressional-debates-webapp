THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 26,
judge. But it is not a question of arithmetic,
it is a matter of plain reading. It is reckless-
ness of statement of which from my knowl-
edge of my colleague I thought him incapable
of, and still deem him so if not imposed on.
If he says that in taking the estimates for the
fiscalyears endingin 1869-70 lam notright 
Mr. DAWES. When I speak of estimates
I do not speak of appropriations.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. He an-
swers me that when he speaks of estimates he
does not speak of appropriations. I ask him
for bread and he gives me a stone. I will read
from his speech:
" Mr. Sco field. Does the gentleman refer to the
estimates of last year, or to the appropriations ?
" Mr. Dawes. I am speaking of the appropria-
tions."
If he says that in taking the estimates for the
fiscalyears endingin 1869-701 am notright, ani
that I ought to have taken one year still further
back into Andrew Johnson's administration—
of the economy and honesty of which he appears
now to be the voluntary defender—I shall then
find that there was no appropriation asked
for whatever for coal; because there was a
balance on h,and January 1, 1867, under the
unexpended appropriation applicable for fuel
for the Navy of $6,811,963 68; so great a bal-
ance that in September following the Navy
Department turned into the Treasury from that
appropriation $5,400,000. In addition to that
they had coal on hand January 1, 1867, 35,000
tons; January 1,1868, 36,386 tons, and June30,
1868, 36,000 tons; while they had available for
the purchase of coal on the 1 st January, 1868,
$2,314,278 31, including their appropriation.
Surely here was margin enough out of which
by proper economy to save $2,000,000!
But the gentleman thinks it impossible that
in the matter of coal a saving of $2,000,000
might be effected. I can see very readily how
that might be, and I give him the figures for
the benefit of his arithmetic. Assume that we
have fifty steam-vessels in commission, large
and small. Twenty tons a day while steaming
would be a low estimate, or one thousand tons
per day. Admit that they steam two hundred
days alone out of a year, less than two thirds
of the time ; that will be two hundred thousand
tons of coal. Suppose that coal to cost, with
the transportation to foreign ports and iabor,
what Gideon Welles estimated it would cost in
1868, $27 71 per ton, and the amount of the
cost of coal for a Navy using steam less than
two thirds of the time would be $5,542,000.
Add to this the cost of wear and tear of ma-
chinery while steaming, say ten percent, ayear
on the amount of the cost of the machinery, of
which $10,000,000 will be a low estimate, and
youhaveagrandaggregateof$6,542,000. Now
the Secretary of the Navy, by ordering that they
shall steam but one third of the time, or but
one hundred days in the year, and use their
sails the rest of the time, would save one half
of that amount. Is the proposition of the Sec-
retary to save $2,000,000 by using sails instead
of steam so preposterous as the chairman of
the Committee on Appropriations would sug-
gest?
Referring to the 814th page of the message
and documents of 1866-67 this report is found:
"The contracts for coal for the current year call
for fifty-two thousand tons, twelve thousand tons at
$7 28 to be delivered at New York, and forty thou-
sand tons at $5 61 per ton at Philadelphia."
So that the coal for the Navy to be delivered
at Philadelphia alone was $311,760. Estimate
what it would cost to distribute that at a foreign
station. But by going to the book of estimates
for the year 1869 I find that the coal for the
seventy steam vessels, atfive hundred tons each,
making thirty-five thousand tons, is estimated
to cost to the Navy Department, with all ex-
penses of transportation, storage, and labor
thereon, $900,000, or $27 71 per ton. So that
if the cost of coal to the Navy of the fifty-two
thousand tons for 1867 averaged at the cost
price of what it was estimated for in 1868—if
the fifty-two thousand tons bought and dis-
tributed in 1868 all over the world cost what
Gideon Welles, my colleague's neighbor in Con-
necticut, estimated that his coal would cost him
on an averageper ton in 1868, then we shall have'
the fifty-two thousand tons cost $1,440,920.
The difficulty with my colleague's estimate is
that he mistook entirely or overlooked the fact
as to the amount estimated for in the last two
years; and I am afraid he took Gideon Welles's
letter as guide for his statements and not the
book of estimates for which I have given him
book and page.
Again, he did not take into consideration
that we had established large coal depots in
almost all parts of the world; that in 1867 the
Bureau of Equipment and Repairs report (see
page 814 Message and Documents) that it is
about to establish coal depots in the East Indies
and the Mediterranean ; and that at the end of
the war, fearing a collision with Great Britain,
we filled up our coal depots in every neutral
port wherever we had them, so that we had no
occasion when the war suddenly reduced our
naval force to supply the few ships we had
with a great amount of coal any more than at
the end of the war, when the estimates had
been made in the subsistence department of
the Army for feeding a million and a half of
men and the Army was suddenly reduced, it
was necessary to make any estimates until the
small army of forty thousand men had ate up
the supplies which were furnished for fifteen
hundred thousand, which would have taken
them about thirty-,seven years if all had been
bought and none sold.
Now, if the Commissary General of Sub-
sistence had reported to the House that by
reducing the ration of the Army he could save
a large sum, say $200,000, and that he did not
require any appropriation for subsistence,
would the chairman of the Committee on Ap-
propriations turn round and say, 11 What
achievement in mathematics is that by which
you propose to save $200,000 out of nothing ?
Won't you go to work, General, upon the na-
tional debt and see if you can't abolish it within
four years?"
The fact is, the figures will show precisely as
follows, as to the existing balances of unex-
pended appropriation for the Navy: in the
year ending June, 1868, $18,345,360; in the
year ending June, 1869, $16,007,154. To this
balance sums were constantly added by the sale
of old material. Add the balance on hand
June, 1809, $16,007,154, to appropriations
for that year, $15,966,666, and the sum of
$31,963,820 was actually appropriated last
year against $28,441,761, making a deduction
asked for this year by the Secretary of the Navy
of $3,522,059, if all is appropriated that Gen-
eral Grant calls for, thus taking $16,000,000
more out of the $49,000,000 that the chairman
of the committee charges us with.
Thus far we have dealt only with the appro-
priations and estimates, which may or may not
show extravagance. But the expenditure, as
in the case of the War Department, is the test
of economy; and when reduced io that test
the Navy Department comes out triumphant.
I give you a table of the expenditures of An-
drew Johnson's administration during the first
nine months of the year 1868, as compared
with the first nine months of General Grant's
administration, and the saving is shown to be
in the Navy Department alone $3,521,822.

I have been a little careful upon this matter
of the Navy because there has been an idea in
the country—whether right.or wrong I will
not now discuss—that the late administration
of the Navy Department was characterized by
inefficiency and extravagance; and when the
chairman of the Committee on Appropriations
arraigns the present administration of the Navy
Department in comparison with that of the late
Secretary the country is at once aroused and
shocked, because there, of all other places, the
Republican party expected that Grant's admin-
istration would be an improvement.
treasury department.
Let us now examine the charge of my col-
league involved in the apparent excess of the
estimates for the Treasury._ The amount is
apparently over the appropriation of last year
$8,431,613. Butthere is omitted for 1870-71 for
matters which were appropriated for 1869-70,
no appropriation now being asked for those
objects, $1,229,300, so that the actual excess
for 1870-71 is $7,202,313. Let us see whether
for that balance there is any ground for the
charge of recklessness of expenditure, which
hasbeen so ruthlessly brought against his former
colleague, the Secretary of the Treasury, because
he is a part of the Administration "at the
other end of the avenue'' which is assailed.
The first great item in that excess is for public
works, being $7,347,126 estimated for against
an appropriation last year of $1,198,000, being
a difference apparently of $6,189,126, so that
if this excess in estimate can be explained
it will swallow up almost the apparent excess
and relieve the Treasury of the charge of
extravagance. Now, as in the case of the esti-
mates for public works in the engineer depart-
ment, every member of this House knows that
whenever a public building is proposed to be
built by order of Congress estimates must be
furnished from the supervising architect of the
Treasury, whether that building is a mint, a
custom-house, court-house, marine hospital, or
a post office.
The Treasury has nothing to do with recom-
mending such buildings or ordering their con-
struction; that is, for Congress alone; and it is
the duty by law of the Treasury to inform Con-
gress how much is necessarily to be expended
on each building in the fiscal year to press it
toward completion, and there its duty stops.
As to this $6,000,000, it must be remembered
that Congress last year ordered the erection
of two buildings—the post office and court-
house in New York, and the post office and
Treasury building in Boston—both, in my judg-
ment, necessary, and both economical expendi-
tures of money, because of the saving that
would be made in rent and interest if there
were no other, and these buildings alone call
for $2,250,000 for these estimates which Con-
gress itself ordered the Secretary to make by
law. Now my colleague complains of his ex-
travagance. Will the House or the country
sustain this charge? I think not, as it is the
act of Congress alone, and not of the Secretary.
Another excess in estimate is for "photog-
raphers and clerks in the office of the super-
vising architect," whose salaries and expenses
have always heretofore been charged to each
public work and taken out of each separate
appropriation upon which their services were
required. _ But the Secretary of the Treasury,
thinking it proper that Congress should know
exactly the cost of running his office, directed
that their salaries should appear in the appro-
priation ; they thus are only paid from the gen-
eral Treasury instead of specific appropriations.
The amount, $10,000, is the same to the Gov-
ernment either way. One would think the Sec-
retary should be commended and not assailed
for this.
„ in, a new mint was built in Nevada by
the order of Congress, and goes into operation
the next fiscal year, and calls for $17,200 more
than last year. Is the Administration blama-
ble for this order of Congress?
Again, the territorial Legislatures were last
