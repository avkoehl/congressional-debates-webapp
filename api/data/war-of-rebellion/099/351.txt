know there is a good road from there to Blackville, which any negro can show you. The corps marched from Nimmon's to Springtown Meeting House. The road as far as we have been over it is good.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERES CAVALRY COMMAND, Blackville, February 8, 1865-12 m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

GENERAL: I will encampe to-night at Williston and destroy some track; February 9, at or before Windsor, and all the following day make demonstration toward Augusta. Will, if prudent, destroy Government property at Aiken, and as much railroad as possible and return to Windsor. I will be prudent, bold, but not rash.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

J. KILPATRICK,

Brevet Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, February 8, 1865.

General KILPATRICK,Blackville:

GENERAL: I have just received your note in cipher. I send you a copy of orders for the next move, which will give you the key to the whole. * Wheeler writes to General Howard offering not to burn cotton if we don't burn hourses. I assured him that he would oblige me by burning cotton, for it saves us the trouble; that we don't burn occupied houses, but if people vacate their own hourses I don't think they should expect us to protect them. You may burn all cotton; spare dwelling houses that are occupied, and teach your men to be courteous to women; it goes a great ways; but take all provisions and forage you need. Act as though you are to be followed by infantry. I expect Hood's army will trhy and join the South Carolina army about Columbia and I will try and interpose again at Orangeburg. I will order the Fourteenth Corps to Williston and Guignard's Brigade or Pine Log Bridge. Edisto is narrow and easily passed up there. The Orangeburg and Edgefield road is the "key line" of South Carolina.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
