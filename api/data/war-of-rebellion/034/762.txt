Governor ROBINSON, Frankfort, Ky.:

Governor TOD, Columbus, Ohio:

Morgan's advance probably encamped at Locust Grove last night, with his line extending as far down as West Union. Hobson was in close pursuit, and his main body no doubt reached Sardinia last night. I have sent up what I considered an ample force of artillery and infantry, convoyed by gunboats, to prevent his crossing. I have also sent a cavalry force which will reach Portsmouth this afternoon, and will immediately move out to check Morgan's advance. It is possible that he may turn up in the direction of Chillicohte. Our prospect of catching Morgan is fair.

What force have we at Piketon? Have all the bridges over the Scioto been burned? If not, they must be at once, to prevent Morgan's passage. Answer quick.

General WHITE, Catlettsburg:

Do not send any steamer down. Our forces are moving up toward Portsmouth, and will probably reach there this afternoon. Morgan was at Locust Grove last night, evidently moving on Portsmouth, but may turn and go in direction of Chillicothe, though not likely.
