I had intended to-day advancing to the Rappahannock at the railroad crossing and Kelly's Ford, and attempting the passage of the river. Indications last evening of a storm caused a postponement of the movement. I will be made to-morrow, and I think with a favorable result.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY RESERVE BRIGADE,November 6, 1863.

General BUFORD:

My pickets yesterday reported the enemy across the river above Kelly's Ford. A staff officer I sent out by Payne's house from here found the enemy's pickets there, but not in force, only a few vedettes.

This morning the enemy crossed above Kellys' Ford (near Wheatley's, I believe) and drove my pickets at Kelly's in. The report I get from my pickets is very indefinite. The number of the enemy is not reported, nor is it stated how far my pickets were driven. Captain Feilner, at Morrisville, with the reserve of the regiment (the First Cavalry) re-enforced Sumner, but whether he regained his former position or not is not stated. The enemy are on this side the river. My pickets on Hartwood Church road report that Kilpatrick returned toward Warrenton Junction yesterday morning. I have nothing further in regard to the enemy's movement down the river. The enemy hold this side of the river all the way from Rappahannock Bridge to below Kelly's Ford now.

I sent all my wagons for supplies this morning to Warrenton Junction. I have sent to front for more definite reports, and will send them in as soon as received.

Very respectfully,

W. MERRITT,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

[P. S.] - I inclose report* I have from picket.

[General BUFORD:]

GENERAL: From further information I conclude that the affair at Kelly's Ford did not amount to much. The enemy hold this side of the ford, though. Shall I drive them across? I would do so without orders, provided our entire line could be advanced, and thus some good result from a fight. My picket line at present is very unsatisfactory. Both parties out stand a chance of being driven in, and have to travel so far that such an occurrence would be extremely demoralizing to the men. There is no additional news.

Very respectfully,

W. MERRITT,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
