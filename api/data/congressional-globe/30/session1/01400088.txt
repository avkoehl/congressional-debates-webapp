THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

do it successfully, they then denied imr pmver to
carry on a war without our ow.i onumLu ie? , stiouid
circumstances require such an exert«on oi national
strength. This was our first great trial; form the
invasion of Canada, during the last war, die oper-
ations were so near, that they did not test our
strength for distant warfare. The trial has been
made, and lias succeeded. 1S0 one will hereafter
call in question our capacity to assert our rights,
wherever these may require our interference. If
the great experiment had failed, it would have
taken ages to recover from the misfortune. But
now, \vhere\er the American flag is borne, or the
name of American known, and that wherever is
everywhere, the glorious feats of this war have
proclaimed our power, and have announced that
we have taken our position side by side with the
mightiest nations of the world. Hereafter, in the
wildest dreams of ambition, there will be no dream
of conquering us; nor will any hostile foot pol-
lute our shore but to escape from it, if it can, as
best u may.
The present bill provides for raising ten addi-
tional regiments of infantry to serve during the
war. The'average number of each regiment m
the field is rather less than threc-fouiths of the
legal establishment; so that this measure, if adopt-
ed, will add about seven thousand five hundred
men ip the army. The organization is precisely
that provided in the act which passed at the last
session of Congress for raising an additional force;
and as the details were then fully considered, and
are svell known to the Senate, I need not recapitu-
late them here.
The reasons which render this increase of force
necessary, are so clearly and forcibly stated in the
report of the Secretary of War, that I need do
little more than request that that portion of the
document may be read.
The following extract from the report of the
Secretary of War, was then read by the Secretary :
" Our carter of-net c^, -o dia?trou« to Mexico ; our con-
quest of >o iuuhj of her states and territories; the &ubjii«a-

Our further operations mu&t, m my opinion, be con-
ducted in oik- of the three following modes: Jin f, to take
and Isold an indemnity line, to recede from ah places arid
position* now occupied in advance of it, and cea^e from all
aggressive operations beyond that line; second, to overrun
the whole e mntry, and hoid all the principal pKees m it by
permanent ganifon? ; and, third. t>> retain \\ hat we now pha-

" In audition to the troops required to garrison places to
be retained, it i** proposed to ha\c in the held a competent
foice for aggressive operations; to strike the enemy when-
e\er he may piesent a vulnerable point; to open avenues
lioiu tue pons in our possession into the enemj-'s countiy;
and to covijj .aid to tubjcct to  ur control some of his rub
mining distucts and produ* tive a«iicultiual region^. Jtis
not deemed pr-.p.'r to poj.it out in more detail the move-
menu and objects contemplated m the further prosecution
of the war upon tlus plan
Assuming that this plan of operations recom-
mended by the Secretary of War is the true one,
(and, for myself, I have nu doubt upon that sub-
ject.) we have then foor great objects to be kept in 1
view* in estimating the force to be provided for the ,
future conduct of the war : 1
|| 1. Ti. i continued occupation of the important
■) position we now hold.
!j 2. The taking po>session of such other com-
ji manding points as expetience may show to be
■J pi oner, anu as the circumstances of the war may :
,! lequne.
i| 3. The preservation of the nccessary comrau-
'j nitation between our positions, as weil from the
j: sea-coast to the capital, as jn other portions of the
'i country which may be brought into subjection
to US.
jj 4. A strong foice, independent of what is neccs-
fj sary for these purposes, which shall always be '
'i kept upon the alert, and ready to move xvheneva*
1; theie may be any appearance of an outbreak on ■
| the part of the Mexican people.
:! The organization and maintenance nf a large
farce may be the means of rendeimg its employ-
j! ment unnecessary. It is much better to render
|| opposition hopeless, by the display of Uiength,
[: than to excite it into action, by the exhibition of '
weakness, arid then to he compelled to resort to
desperate struggles to lemedy evils which ordinary ■
■ prudence would have prevented. It is true hu-
manity also, and we oxve it to ourselves, to our
- mmy who have done and sulfercd so much, to the
; enemy, and to the woild. Remember, xir, that
f our troops are three thousand miles from home, in
■ the midst of a hostile population of eight or ten
| millions, and that, by great exertions and unpaial-
i leled bravery, they have succeeded in a partial sub-
j jugauon of the country. But we have no light
; again to expose them to such peri's. There is a
vast superiority of physical force opposed to them
All experience shows, that in this condition an
invaded people will suddenly break out into in-
surrections, and sometimes display an energy and
courage, which they failed to exhibit upon the bat-
tle-Held. Who would weigh with a critical bal-
ance the amount of opposition we have to appre-
hend, and the strength nccessai y to overcome it,
and then coolly provide this calculatcd force, and
leave events to take care of themselves' What
kind of political arithmetic would that be, which
would say, if so many troops have done so much,
how many will it require to do so much more? I
trust that the supplies we may vote* will be given
upon a far better principle : upon a principle
1 which shall look, indeed, to results, but which
shall make the most liberal arrangements for at-
taining them.
The proceedings of this Government are as well
known iiv Mexico as here. They do not indeed
travel upon the wings of the wind, but they travel
xvith the power of the pi ess, and are spread through
the civilized world. Vigorous and piompt action
■ will produce the happiest effect upon the state of
things in Mexico. Nothing would conduce more
to impress upon the people of that country the
necessity of a pe&ce than a unanimous determina-
tion in Congress to put forth all the strength of
the nation till it is obtained.

pared from the leport of the Adjutant Geneial,

It will be seen that we have in Mexico, under
General Srott, besides the garrisons of Tampico
and Vera Cruz, about 29,000 men, rank and file,
excluding officers; and in the command of General
Taylor, an aggregate of 6,727 men, oiHceis inclu-
ded.
From the  s(atoi ents-* of the Adjutant General, it
appears that the actual force kept up is lt*s, by
one-fourth than the legal force authorized by law.
The continually renewing casualties of war, and
otlu-r circumstances, occasion this difference. And
it is not probable that the existing legal establish-
