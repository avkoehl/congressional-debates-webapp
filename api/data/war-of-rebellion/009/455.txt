GENERAL: From your telegraphic dispatches I learn that the enemy apparently is making no forward movement, nor do you appear to be able to discover that he is making any preparations with that view. That lands me to fear that while making demonstrations in that quarter and on the Peninsula against General Magruder, his real object is to attack Norfolk from both sides, with the force now collecting at Hampton and neighborhood on one side and that under General Burnside on the other.
