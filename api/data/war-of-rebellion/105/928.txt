SUNDAY EVENING, March 16, 1862-8. 30 p. m.

Since writing the foregoing I have received an express from Major Rigg. It is important that Pishon go by the new route if possible, having reference to keeping his horses in fighting condition. Fill up his company from Fritz's. Be sure he has ninety sabers. If it is not possible for him to go through direct, send him out upon the other road, so that he can avail himself of wagons and forage now en route to Carriso Creek. He must travel light. The men need have but the clothes they weat and food and powder and ball. All other articles will afterward be sent to Camp Wright and forwarded from there. I send Lieutenant Wellman with this. He is to go with Captain Pishon's company. Let there be not one moment lost.

I am, major, respectfully,

JAMES H. CARLETON,

Colonel First California Volunteers, Commanding.

Major E. A. RIGG,

First Infantry California Vols., Commanding at Fort Yuma, Cal.:

MAJOR: I have ordered Major Fergusson to send Pishon's company of the First Cavalry California Volunteers to report to you. Two wagons left here to-day with plank for the repairs of Indian Well. These will proceed on directly to Fort Yuma to be used in transporting supplies up to where McCleave and Calloway and Pishon are to operate. Get the cavalry and mules up the river on grass without delay, so that not a straw of hay or kernel of corn more than absolutely necessary may be consumed this side of the Pima Villages. If McCleave is successful in the demonstration which he may make on Tucson, he can get a plenty of forage and beef there and from Sonora. To-morrow fifteen wagons laden with ammunition, provisions, &amp;c., will leave San Pedro for Fort Yuma. These also you will retain to haul barley, &c., up to Grinnel's. Have every string drawn to the utmost and you will accomplish wonders. But again, keep your own counsels.

I am, major, respectfully,

JAMES H. CARLETON,

Colonel First California Volunteers, Commanding.
