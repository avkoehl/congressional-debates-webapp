Brigadier General R. INGALLS:

The commanding general has observed with regret the publication in newspapers a recent date of two letters or telegrams, addressed by you to Senator Nesmith, respecting the operations of this army, and he directs me to remind you that publications of this character are forbidden by general orders, and to say it is expected that no further communications of a similar character will appear in the public prints.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, SECOND CORPS,

Brown's House, May 15, 1864.

Dr. McPARLIN,

Medical Director, Army of the Potomac:

We have about 200 of our own and rebel in the immediate vicinity of the Fifth Corps, whom we would be much pleased to get off we could. But our ambulances, about twenty-five, are in bad running condition, and as for army wagons, there is no further hope of them, I conclude, or we should have seen some by this [time]. We shall probably be obliged to leave them to the care of the enemy.

Very respectfully,

A. N. DOGHERTY,

Medical Director.
