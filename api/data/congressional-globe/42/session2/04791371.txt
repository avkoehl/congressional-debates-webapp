people to the last extreme on the one hand, while
on the other it willfully orders the violation of the
constitution by the agents who are to carry said
order into execution. It forbids the assembling of
the people on the days of election : it prohibits free
speech; it forbids the free and lawfuLmovement of
the citizen in person; it torbids the citizen the right
to advocate the election of the candidate of his
choice; it authorizes the judges of elections to close
the polls on the merest pretext; it subjects the
citizen's motives and purposes to the judgment of
policemen; it authorizes policemen to disperse
bodies of citizens without warrant of law, and when
they have been guilty of no violation of law; it
subjects the citizen to arrest and detention while in
attendance at an election, when he has not been
guilty of treason, felony, or breach of the peacc ; it
is ordered to be executed as a criminal law of the
State, when it has not a single feature of a law; it is
the unlawful will of the Executive, enforced by him
through the power of an armed police upon an un-
armed people; it is the will of a despot and the act
of a tyrant overriding the supreme law of the land.
(Section 2, article 3, constitution.)
19. By orders executed through his armed bodies
of police, the Executive has.taken control of i?eace-
able assemblies of the people, called together for
peaceful and lawful purposes, and there suppress
free speech, under threats of arrest and subjection
to punishment as criminals. (Galveston case )
20. The Executive has deliberately disregarded the
solemn judgment of tho district court, and ordered
his policemen to contemn the court, and by force,
with arms in their hands, to defy the court, and to
execute his will in a question of law where the court
had decided the case and entered his judgment of
record. (Brownsville case.)
21. For the purpose and with the intent to retain
the power they now hold, and'to avoid having the
free will of the people expressed in the enactment
of laws, the Executive and others in authority con-
template (and are now actively engaged to accom-
plish their object) so apportioning representation in
the Legislature as that only the voice of a small pro-
portion of the people shall be heard. It is proposed
to give some localities much larger representation
than the population thereof lawfully authorizes, and
to take from other localities representation to which
their population entitles them. It is purposed to
ignore local representation and to make large areas
of territory representative districts, to the end that
the sentiment of the population of a few localities
may control the voice of the State in the enactment
of laws. (Bill in both houses.)
While, sir, wo have not specified all the acts of the
present administration infracting the constitution,
in violation of law, and in willtul disregard ot the
rights of the people, nor entered minutely into tho
features of those named, yet we think we have shown
enough to call upon all inen for the most serious re-
flection, and to show the tendencies of the present
administration of tho State government.
Without enlarging, we may say thai; the power
which in republican government is supposed to rest
in the people is fast departing from the people of
Texas and concentrating itself in tho hands of one
man—the Executive; that the people of this State
no longer govern themselves, but arc governed by
E, J. Davis, as completely as if there were no con-
stitutions, State or Federal. "While in form we have
a republican government, m substance and m fact
we have a despotism, which constantly becomes more
and more absolute, and will certainly end in unqual-
ified enslavement of the people, unless some check
is interposed.
Respectfully, W. M. WALTON, Chair man.
Hon. A. J. Hamilton, Chairman of General Committee
of Twenty-One.
Such a report as that from such a body of
men needs no comment; the charges are dis-
tinct, the laws are referred to, the specifications
are clear. I have investigated the matters suf-
ficiently to be satisfied of their truth, and' the
references will enable any member of this
House to do so.
This same convention appointed a sub-com-
mittee to make a report respecting the debts
and taxation of the State of Texas. That sub-
ject, too, has been alluded to to-day. It is
shown in the majority report of the Committee
to Investigate the Condition of the Southern
States that Texas had no debt whun the war
broke out; and it further appears that when
the present State administration took posses-
sion of the government the State had more
money in its treasury than would pay the debts
then owing; that the State owed some three
hundred thousand dollars, while there was
some four hundred thousand dollars on hand
in the State treasury.
The report will show how matters stand in
that regard now:
Sub-Committee Koom,
Austin. September 25,1871.
To Hon. A. J. Hamilton,
Chairman of Committee of Twenty-0>ie.
Sir : The committee on statistics beg leave to sub-
mit the following report as the result of their delib-
erations:
Previous to the adoption of our present State con-
stitution the Legislature met biennially, and the
appropriations for State expenditures were made
for two years.
We find from an examination of the laws that the
seventh Legislature appropriated, to be paid from
the State treasury, for the ordinary expenses of the
State government for the years 1858 and 1859, the
sum of $545,740. This gives one half that amount,
or $272,870, as the ordinary expenses for each of the
years 1858 and 1859.
The entire appropriations of that Legislature for
all purposes, for the years 1858 and 1859, including
the above, also for tho old debt of the republic,
frontier defense, &c., amounted to only $809,592 49.
We find from the same source that the eleventh
Legislature appropriated for the ordinary expenses
of the State government for the years 1867 and 1868
the sum of $481,300. This gives one half that amount,
or $240,050, as the ordinary expenses for each of the
5 ears 1867 and 1868.
It will be recollected that there was no session of
the Legislature during either of those years. The
entire appropriations made by the eleventh Legisla-
ture, that met in 1866, for all purposes for the ex-
penses of the years 1867 and 1868, for the Legislature
of 1866, and in addition thereto the expenses of the
government from the 13th of August to the 31st
of December, 1S66, amounted only to the sum of
$956,850 77.
We find from tho same source that the appropria-
tions made by the Legislature of 1870, for the ordin-
ary expenses of the State government for the fiscal
year from the 1st of September, 1870, to the 1st of
September, 1871, was $756,383.
The entire appropriations of that Legislature, for
all purposes cxccpt the subsidy to the International
railroad, amounted to the sum of $1,632,270 50. The
appropriations of the Legislature that met in the
early part of this year, (1871,) for the ordinary ex-
penses of the government for the fiscal year begin-
ning on the 1st of September, 1871, and ending on
the 31st of August, 1872, were $1,072,662; for schools
the same years, $504,500; for deficiencies for fiscal
year ending 31st August, 1871, §364,743 45; for all
other purposes, except subsidies to railroads, $178,-
699 83; making the entire appropriations by that
Legislature, exclusive of subsidies to railroads,
$2,120,605 28.
It will bo recollected that the Legislature of 1870
also voted a subsidy of $10,000 a mile to the Inter-
national railroad, which will impose upon our
people a debt of at least $8,000,000, if the company
complies with the terms of the law; and the Legis-
lature of 1871 granted an additional subsidy of
$6,000,000 to the Transcontinental and Southern
Pacific railroads.
We find that the costof tho Legislature of 1857 was
§159,760; that of 1866 was $167,000; that of 1870,
§307,000, and that of 1871, ^285,000, exclusive of the
expenses of the adjourned session, which will prob-
ably be several hundred thousand dollars more,while
the number of members, the per diem, and mileage
were the same for that of 1866 as tor the Legislature
of 1870 and 1871.
We find that the od vcitorein tax unon property in
the years 1858 and 1859 was for the State one eighth
of one per cent.; for the county, one half of that
rate.
In 1866 the rate of taxation was increased, for the
State to fifteen cents on each §100, and for county
purposes not exceeding one half of that rate. The
Legislature of 1871 increased the taxes as follows,
namely;
Ad valorem State tax upon property, one fourth of
which is for schools, one half of one per cent.; ad
valorem county tax, one quarter of one per cent.; cid
valorem road and bridge tax, one quarter of one per
cent.; ad valorem tax for bchool-houses, one eighth
of oneper cent.; tax for building school-houses and
maintaining schools, one per cent.; a poll-tax of one
dollar for schools; a poll-tax of one dollar for roads
and bridges; besides the occupation and license
taxes, and the tax for the frontier bonds, which is
understood to have been fixed by the comptroller at
five cents on each §100, from which it will be seen
that our present, rate of taxation for State and county
purposes is about $2 17i on each #100, besides the
poll-tax and occupation and license taxes.
The following is an estimate of the taxes levied
from tho people tho present year. The estimated
value of the property subject to taxation is $212,-
000,000;
One half of one per cent, on above, as ad valorem
State tax, will produce $1,060,000
One quarter of one per cent, ad valorem
county tax    530,000
One quarter of one per cent, ad valorem
bridge tax  530,000
One eighth of one percent., as one quar-
ter of State tax for school purposes  205,000
One half of one per cent., as tax to pay
frontier bonds  106,000
One per cent, tax for schooi-houso pur-
poses. «Src  2,120,000
Poll-tax for roads and bridges, estimated, 150,000
Poll-tax for schools, estimated  130,000
Liconso and occupation for State, esti-
mated   300,000
License and occupation for county, esti-
mated   150,000
Total   S5.351.00Q
In addition to tho above each tax-payer has to pay
for the commission for a&tu-^ing his ad valorem tax,
which it is supposed will amount to about three per
cent, on his ad valorem tax.
It will thus be seen that the State debt and
liabilities have been swelled up to over seven-
teen million dollars from nothing, and the
rate of taxation from sixteen cents to $2 17,
while the taxation for 1871 reaches tho fright-
ful sum of $861,000, never having before
reconstruction exceeded $400,000.
Mr. CLARK, of*Texas. Will the gentle-
man yield to me for a moment ?
Mr. BECK. Yes, sir.
Mr. CLARK, of Texas. I would like to
know whether the gentleman takes the report
of the tax-payers' convention as authority for
making that statement, or whether he would
not prefer to take the books of the comptroller
and treasurer of the State as authority.
Mr. BECK. I will say that I -have taken
the report of the tax-payers' convention to get
the exact figures I am now stating. I do so,
because in the investigations had in refer-
ence to the State of Texas it was found to
be impossible to get any facts stated with
equal authority and with equal fairness, if
the gentleman will take the report of Mr. Bled-
so, the comptroller of Texas, which will be
found on page 422 of the minority report, he
will find the facts to be substantially as I hav*e
stated them from the tax-payers' report. With-
out sending the report of Mr. Bleaso to the
Clerk's desk to be read, I will make it part of
my remarks. It appears from that report that
while the taxes paid in 1860 and 1870 were
very low, the present State and county taxes
have increased enormously. That report reads
as follows:
Comptroller's Office.
Austin, November 22,1871.
Sik: I have the honor to furnish, in reply to your
request therefor, the following information relative
to the financial history of the State:
The indebtedness of the State of Texas in Feb-
ruary, 1861, was $384,569 50, represented by ten per
cent, interest-bearing warrants, issued in payment
of services rendered in protection of the trontier.
At the surrender it was 3328,866, being the uncan-
celed balance of above ten per cent, warrants.
At the inauguration of tho present State govern-
ment the State debt was $362,lo6 17, with a cash
balance in the treasury of $350,683 90, almost suffi-
cient to have liquidated the entireoutstanding State
debt. The increase of debt from the surrender to
the inauguration of the present State government
($40,000) consists of claims against the penitentiary
audited during that time.
On the 1st day of January, 1871, the above debt
was still outstanding, whiio provision had been made
by the Legislature for the issuance of $750,000 seven
per cent, bonds of the State, act 5th of August, 1870.
The cash balance in the treasury had been reduced
from 1350,000 to about $30,000, which before the close
of the month was entirely exhausted, and act of May
19,1871, provided tor the issuance of $400,000 m ten
per cent, bonds of the State, to cover deficiencies in
revenue receipts.
No part of this increase of the indebtedness since
1865 arose from any contingency or event enumer-
ated in query, &c.
During tho rebellion a large portion of the school
fund was appropriated and used for other purposes,
and bonds of the State and certificates of indebted-
ness substituted therefor. Butsincc the rebellion no
such claims have been recognized against the State,
nor has any legislative action been had looking to
the validating of such or payment of accrued inter-
est. No such items are included in the above state-
ment of debt.
The county tax in 1860 was one sixteenth of one
per cent., or six and a quarter cents on the $100
worth of property; it was seven and a half c&nts in
1870, and in 1871 it is twenty-five cents for county
purposes proper, and in addition a special tax for
like amount for roads and bridges, and twelve aud a
half cents forschool purposes; in all, sixty-two and
a half cents on the $100 worth of property, and a
poll-tax of onedollar.
The State tax for the year 1871 is fifty cents on the
$100 worth ot property, and five per ccnt. additional
on such tax, and a poll-tax of one dollar. In addi-
tion to this, the board of school directors have
levied seven eighths percent, on property valuation
throughout the State. Total State and county tax,
$1 77-i per S100 of property. Poll-taxes, two.dollars
per capita, and a State and county occupation tax
equal to about eighteen cents on the $100 worth of
property in the State. ,
At this date it is impossible to estimate with any
degree of accuracy the deficiency tor the year end-
ing 31st August, 1872. It is safe, however, to say
that it will not be less than $1,500,000.
The amount appropriated during the year 1871,
exclusive of what has or may be done during the
present sitting of tho Legislature, 14^,OOo So.
There are large deficiencies for 1871 to be provided
for. In addition to this, tbe State is pledged to the
issuance of her bonds, bearing interest at seven per
cent to the International Railroad Company, at
the rate of $10,000 per mile of its road. The amount
likelv to be completed during the present year is no!
