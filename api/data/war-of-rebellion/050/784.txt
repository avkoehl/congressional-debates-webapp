[CHAP. XLII.

flag when he fell. Corpl. Dorsey A. Leimin, of company I, Twenty-fourth Ohio, seeing the flag fall, rushed to it, rescued it, and bore it off the field, as he did his own regimental colors on two occasions the day before when the color guards had been shot down. Such bravery and high bearing as this is highly deserving the notice of the appointing power. My grateful thanks are due to the brave officers and men of the brigade for their noble conduct through these trying scenes in behalf of the right and to put down the wrong.

My staff officers, Major Kersey, medical director; Captain Peden, provost-marshall; Captain Brooks, inspector; Lieutenant Scott, topographical engineer; Lieutenant Livezey, aide-de-camp, with those heretofore mentioned, as well as my non-commissioned staff, have my grateful acknowledgments for their kind and efficient help during these laborious battles, and they, with me, unfeignedly lament the fall of our comrade and brother, Captain George M. Graves. Many officers and men of my command that it is impossible to refer to specially, are equally deserving with the best of soldier patriots. Captain Adams, Eighty-fourth Illinois; Captain Tinker, Sixth Ohio; Captain Wadsworth, Twenty-fourth Ohio; Lieutenant Patterson, Thirty-sixth Indiana; Lieutenant Hoffman, Twenty-third Kentucky, with 57 brave enlisted men, fell on these battle-fields a sacrifice upon their country's altar. My heart sickens to contemplate these irreparable losses. To the suffering wounded, may the God of Battles soothe their afflictions, heal, and restore them again to usefulness.

The following table shows the casualties of the brigade as nearly as is possible to ascertain at the present time:

Add to this the 659 at Stone's River, with many other casualties in smaller engagements; it shows a fearful destruction of human life in one small command. For further and more minute particulars, reference is made to the report of regimental commanders herewith forwarded.

I have the honor to be, your most humble servant,

WM. GROSE,

Colonel, Commanding Third Brigade.

Captain D. W. NORTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Division.
