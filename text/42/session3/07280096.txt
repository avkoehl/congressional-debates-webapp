Washington Monument.
SPEECH OF HON. N. P. CHIPMAN,
OF DISTRICT OK COLUMBIA,
In the House op Representatives,
February 18, 1873,
On the bill malting an appropriation to complete
the Washington monument. ,
Mr. CHIPMAN. Mr. Speaker, feeling a
deep interest in the completion of -the Wash-
ington monument, and believing it to be my
duty as an American citizen cherishing grate-
fully tbe memory of Washington, I introduced
at tbe second session of this Congress a bill
making an appropriation looking to the com-
pletion of the monument.
The bill was referred to the Com mittee for the
District of Columbia, and by Report No. 48
of the second session of this Congress, this
committee presented to the House the facts
which it regarded as necessary to enable Con-
gress to act intelligently in the matter, and
recommended the appropriation. That docu-
ment is somewhat lengthy, and contains im-
portant facts in such form as to make it diffi-
cult to ascertain the information desirable. My
object, then, in addressing the House at this
time is not so much for the purpose of arous-
ing torpid patriotism, or to indulge in any
panegyric upon the life'and character of the.
Father of his Country, as it is to collate and
arrange such facts as I think members would
be glad to know preparatory to voting upon a
proposition appropriating money for the pur-
pose indicated. As a further stimulus of this
subject, I recently introduced aresolution, upon
which the House directed a select committee
of thirteen, to be appointed with leave to report
at any time, by bill or otherwise, and setting
apart the afternoon of February 22 to consider
the report. It is also for the purpose of aid-
ing the consideration of that report that I sub-
mit these remarks atthis time ; but as a mem-
ber of that committee it would manifestly be
improper for me to express any views in ad-
vance of their report looking to a plan for
completing the monument.
ORIGIN OF THE WASHINSTON MONUMENTAL ASSO-
CIATION.
At the close of the revolutionary war the
Continental Congress, on the 7th of August,
1783, resolved unanimously, "that an eques-
trian statue of General Washington be erected
at the place where the residence of Congress
shall be established and it was directed that
the statue should be supported by a marble
pedestal, on which should be represented four
principal events of the revolutionary war in
which Washington commanded in person. On
the pedestal were to be engraved the following
words:
"The.United States, in Congress assombled, or-
dered this statue to be erected in tho yoar of our
Lord 1783. in honor of George Washington. the illus-
trious Commander-in-Chief of tho Armies of the
United States of America during the war which vin-
dicated and secured thoir liberty, sovereignty, and
independence."
Washington had at this time endeared
himself to the American people as the great
revolutionary leader in their struggle for lib-
erty. As a civil ruler he was yet unknown.
The extraordinary powers conferred upon
him as the leader of the armies proved to be
equally safe in his hands in the management
ot civil government, and it Was as the Presi-
dent of the United States that he earned his
proudest title to the gratitude of his country.
At his death a joint committee of both Houses
of Congress was appointed to consider a suit-
able manner of paying honor to his memory.
It was resolved, among other things, by Con-
gress, December 24tb, 1799:
"That a marble monument bo erected by the
United States at the city of Washington, and that
the family of General Washington be requested to
permit his body to be deposited under it: and that
the monument be so designed as to commemorate
the great events of his military and political life."
A copy of the resolutions was sent to his
widow by the President of the United States.
In her reply, aceeeding to the request, she said :
"Taught by the great example which I have so
long had before me never to oppose my private
wishes to the public will, I need not, I cannot say,
what a sacrifice of individual feeling I make to a
sense of public duty."
Great as must have been the struggle, deep
and painful the sacrifice, the resolution of
Congress which caused it remains unexecuted.
On the 8th of May, 1800, a further report
was made to the House of Representatives, on
which the House passed a resolution " that a
mausoleum be erected to George Washington
in the city of Washington;" and on the 1st
of January, 1801, the House of Representa-
tives passed a bill appropriating $200,000 for
the erection of this mausoleum.
On the 15th of January, 1824, Mr. Buchanan,
late President of the United States, offered,
the following resolution in the House of Rep-
resentatives :
"Jienohcd, That a committee be appointed whose
duty it shall be to inquire in what manner the reso-
lutions of Congress passed on the 24th of December,
1799, relative to the erection of a marble monument
in the Capitol, at the city of Washington, to com-
memorate the great events of tho military and polit-
ical life ofGeneral Washington, maybe best accom-
plished, and that they have leave to report by bill
or otherwise."
Mr. Buchanan supported his resolution by
an earnest speech full of patriotic fire. There
are many spots upon our legislative proceed-
ings which tarnish the good name of our coun-
try, but there is none so discreditable as that
which shows that this resolution was, after
discussion, laid on the table.
On the 13th of February, 1832, a joint re-
port was made to the Senate by Mr. Clay, to
the House of Representatives by Mr. Thomas,
chairmen respectively, of committees, to make
arrangements for celebrating the centennial
anniversary of Washington's birthday. One
of the resolutions, authorized the President of
the Senate and Speaker of the House—
" To make application to John a. Washington, of
Mount Vernon, for the body of George Washington,
to be removed and deposited in the Capitol at
Washington city, in conformity with the resolutions
of Congress of the 24th of December, 1799; and that
if they have obtained the requisite consent thereof,
thoy are further authorised to cause the same to be
romoved and deposited in the Capitol, on the 22d
day of February, 1832."
When the report of the joint committee was
made, one of the standing committees of the
House had under consideration the erection
of the marble statue of Washington, to be
executed by Mr. Greenough, and, as was then
expected, to be placed in the center of the
rotunda of the Capitol ; from some remarks
made by Mr. Clay in the course of the dis-
cussion it would seem that it was the purpose
to place the remains in a vault under tho
center of the rotunda, and under Mr. Green-
ough's monument. Senators and several Rep-
resentatives from Virginia opposed the re-
moval of the remains of Washington from his
native State. Senator Tazewell, of Virginia,
in his remarks, referred to the application
