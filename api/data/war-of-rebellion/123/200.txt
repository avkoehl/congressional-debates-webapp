Major General B. F. BUTLER,

Commanding, &amp;c., New Orleans, La.:

GENERAL: I wrote you last under date of the 29th ultimo,* and have now to say that your dispatch of the 18th ultimo, with the accompanying report of General Phelps concerning certain fugitive negroes that have come to his pickets, has been considered by the President.+

He is of opinion that under the law of Congress they cannot be sent back to their masters; that in common humanity they must not be permitted to suffer for want of food, shelter,or other necessaries of life; that to this end they should be provided for by the quartermaster's and commissary departments, and that those who are capable of labor should be set to work and paid reasonable wages.

In directing this to be done the President does not mean at present to settle any general rule in respect to slaves or slavery, but simply to provide for the particular case under the circumstances in which it is now presented.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

AUBURN, July 3, 1862.
