public interests being involved which induces me to do it. I will write you or telegraph you more frequently in future, unless prevented by absolute necessity.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

MEMPHIS, February 13, 1863.

General ROSECRANS:

Van Dorn has left Tupelo with twelve pieces of artillery and four brigades of cavalry, commanded by Jackson McCulloch, Whitfield, and Armstrong. He is moving in the direction of Florence. Roddey has just joined him with all his force, and Van Dorn's force numbers in all at least 10,000 men. There is little doubt his intention is to operate on your land and river communications. A gunboat would stop him at Florence.

C. S. HAMILTON,

Major-General.

CORINTH, February 13, 1863.

General ROSECRANS:

Van Dorn, with four brigades of mounted men, commanded by Jackson, McCulloch, Whitfield, and Armstrong, with twelve pieces and heavy train, is moving toward Florence. He will be detained by bridges in front burned by our cavalry. I have requested a gunboat to be pushed to Florence. Our cavalry still hangs on their march in North Alabama.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

MURFREESBOROUGH, February 13, 1863.

Captain A. M. PENNOCK, Cairo:

Please send two gunboats up the Tennessee, as far as possible, to clean out everything, at least as far as Florence. Van Dorn, with a cavalry force, will probably try to cross at Eastport or Florence.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, February 13, 1863.

General ROSECRANS:

General Gilbert reached Franklin yesterday, and found a small force of rebel cavalry, which keeps out of range, and watches him. A large force reported at Spring Hill. He asks for cavalry, and I have only the Ninth Pennsylvania, which will not be in condition to subsist itself until its wagons arrive. I can get no teams here. The Sixth Kentucky is arriving; the Seventh and Twelfth expected; so that we will soon have cavalry enough, but it may be two weeks before it is ready for the field. General Smith has arrived.

A. BAIRD,

Brigadier-General.
