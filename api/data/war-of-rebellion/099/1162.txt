Major General JOSEPH WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: General Beauregard directs me to say that General Stevenson has been forced back beyond the North Fork of the Edisto in the direction of Orangeburg, which would indicate an easterly move by the enemy, and that move toward Aiken must be a feint, and desires that you move, with alal the force you can spare, to his support.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

ORANGEBURG, February 11, 1865-1 p. m.

Major-General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: The following dispatch has just been received from General Hardee, dated Charleston, February 11, 1865:

Place yourself in communication with Wheeler and order him peremptorily to send cavalry to protect the flanks of Stevenson and McLaws. He telegraphed me yesterday that he had ordered, 1,300 cavalry to me, which I hope may yet come.

This dispatch is, I presume, in answer to a dispatch of mine, stating that only 100 had reported to McLaws and 100 Stevenson. General Hardee wishes Colonel D. G. White to report to department headquarters as inspector of cavalry. The enemy have just appeared in front of this position. They are understood to have crossed at Holmans' and Duncan's Bridges, so it looks as if they were advancing north.

Very respectfully,

W. D. PICKETT,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Inspector-General.
