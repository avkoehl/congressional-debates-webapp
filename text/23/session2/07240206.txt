The Senate resumed the consideration, as in
Committee of the Whole, of the bill to change the
orginiiition of the Geneial Post Office                   i
fhe question betn"- on the sixteenth section,
submitted by Mr GRUNDY, as an amendment,
] roviding for payment of the debts of the depart-
i ¡ent, which may be owing on the 3Ut Maich,
183)
Mr GRUNDY rose, in support of the amend-
ment, as this subject would be properly discussed
only by those who have carefully examined it In
answer to the remarks of the honoiabte Senator
tiom Louisiana, [Mr Portlr,] made yester lay,
he wished to sty a tew words That honoiable
Senator supposed, because he was no favonteof
the present Administration, ujustice had been
done to his constituents, in regard to the route
leading to New Orleans This route had been
particularly pointed out by the report of the ma-
jority of the committee last session, and but one
ieeble voice ra.sed in its ftvoi, and that not fiom
Louisiana Mr G read fiom the tepoitof the
major ty several passiges going to condemn this
route, and this leport was a favorite with the
majority of the Senate He was the only one who
supported the conduct of the Postma&tei General
on that occasion     lie wished to do justice to that
officer, he wished justice to be rendered wheie it j
was due     Last /ear the head   if that depattri ent
was conderine 1 foi  ex ei d    g f„cili let , no , he
was centred for withdrawn g tnem

The Postmastci General (said Mr G ) did not '
reverse ihe political maxim which considers all
innocent until they are found guilty, w'nch, per
haps, he ought to have done, and suspected all
peisons of havirg improj er snd selfish designs on
the department A thousand irileences weie
biou^ht to b*ai upon the interest of the contráete,
of the inn kcepei, of the stage dnvei, oftheciti/en
who provided hsy aneloat^orehickensand butter,
foi the support of those employed in this business,
and, finally, by members of Congress
1 he Senator fiom New Jersey had told us the
people would not be -sti fied with the turning out
of a single cleik Th it Senatoi would not be
satisfied with the tumi g out of a single cleik—
not with the turning out ot the head of thatdepai t
ment—not with turning out all the clerks in all
the departments—not wnh the turning out of all
the Heads of the departments—no, not even of the
Pi esident of the United States, foi then the Vice
President would turn himself in
Mr  G  contended that if Congress took away
the revenues of the depaitment, they should also I
pay all just and honest debts     He was not dis-
pojed  to trust to some f iture appiopnation      It
was better to do a thing while they were alout it
Mr  LEIGH said he understood  the report of
the minouty of the committee at the last session
as a lecommendation   to  pay  the  deb's of tl e
department     But although he did not be'ieve any
such debts contiacied as these had been, without
authority of law, were 1 indmg on the  United
States, yet he thought that perhaps in point of j
policy the Government ought to pay the money, ,
because it had  received   the benefit of it, and he '
designed to vote for such a proposition wnen the ¡
department should  be  placed  upon  a  safe  and I
secure  foundation      But he did   understand the
honorable gentleman then to ssy that no proposi-
tan was made or intended to oe made for such an
appropitation     Now, as to the payment of these
debts, let a schedule be laid befoie the Senate, and
if it shoulu appeal that they were bona fide debts,
he would vote to pay the creditors of the depart-
ment, but he would not vote it to the Post Office
Department     For suppose one of these debts was
a contract for extia allowances to Reeside or Rob  i
inson for services which weie not peifoimed
Would anybody pay it was r ght to pay a ''e t
s ) nai lle&ily unjust, and wh c i it! y chai ce'ior
would orjei to Le it u' tied ' Wilt i he taw a
schedule, and was tótioleii of tluir no íesty, I e
Aiould vole a liberal appiop latioi to satisfy them
He would not m ke ehaige3 of conu, t on, but
whetl er the evils eoi ipluned of had grown out i í
want of vigilance, condition,ot anv ot'iei cause,
he mus think it was not Obudiah who had tied all
t tese knot"-
Mi   EWING denied that there  was anything

It was not the disposition of our | eople t > get up

as to the rep< rt, h  rdmittpd   t did  not ptodure
conviction among the whole community—it was
not exoected it would do so     It was not till these
things weie examined that their enoimity would
ue observed     With regard to the appropnation
asked, he would state that theie was a very laige
sum due to small contractors prior to January lb ,
1834, miny of whom  were  now nearly rmied,
and now suppose this appropriation of &300 000
should le made, the laige eontractors, who had
perfonned no service, would come in and  sweep
it av/ay, while the honest small contractors would
get nothn g    1 h^grossamoun' due to contrsctois
the Postmaster Geneial said was about §400 000,
but the accounvnfs employed by the committee,
and they weie as skiKul as any m the D „tnct,
htd made the actual sum orly about $199 000
[low tl en could we make a sweeping apfropm-
tion to pay them?    But there were accepted drift",
too, in circulation, not paid, amounting to §160 000,
but payable at a future day, and in the aggregate
they smouiited on the 1st of April last to §160 000,
as he had stated     We could  not then  make an
appiopuat on     He hoped the amendment would
be rejected, and then, when sufficient data   could
b° obtained, he would introduce a bill to appro-
priate annually such sum as would be required for
payment of the just and legal debts of the depart-
ment
