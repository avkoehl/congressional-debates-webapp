A list marked A, hereunto annexed, gives casualties. A list marked B, hereunto annexed, gives captured property. A list marked C,* hereunto annexed, gives the number of prisoners. All of which has been turned in to the respective departments to which they belong. Having but a small amount of transportation I could not bring off all the small-arms abandoned by the enemy, but they were destroyed by having artillery moved over them. The enemy admit killed about 25 men and 2 officers, and from 75 to 100 men and horses put hors de combat.

Before closing this report I beg respectfully to mention Colonel C. L. Upham, of the Fifteenth Connecticut Infantry, whose able and cordial co-operation has been of great service to me. Captain Green and his command of the One hundred and thirty-second New York Infantry deserve great credit. Troops B and D, of the Twelfth New York Cavalry, behaved well. The artillery was not used, but I am satisfied that Captain Mercer would have fought his battery well. If the commanding general deems the expedition a success it is entirely due to the good conduct of every officer and man engaged in it, and am confident that had my force been treble I should have commanded Kinston, destroyed the ram, and the Goldsborough railroad. I am, however, satisfied that the ram can never be used this way.

I have the honor to be, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. J. CLAASSEN,

Colonel 132nd New York, Commanding Expedition.

Captain J. A. JUDSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, District of North Carolina.
