General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Hancock's House:

General Grant appears to be gradually approaching the York River Railroad. Whether with a view of touching the James River or not I cannot ascertain. I am ignorant of the movements of the enemy in your front, or whether it would be in your power to take position north of James River.

R. E. LEE,

General.
