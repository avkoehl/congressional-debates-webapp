That one of the rifle guns now in the middle battery, immediately opposite Dam No. 1, should be removed to an embrasure in the traverse nearly opposite to the same place, and the other rifle gun be placed in the work on the right, where the is an embrasure finished, from which it will be able to fire over the space between the dam and our works opposite.
