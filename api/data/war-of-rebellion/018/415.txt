Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. SHIELDS,

Major-General, Commanding Division.

MIDDLETOWN, VA., June 20, 1862.

The PRESIDENT:

I delivered your message to General Fremont to-day, with such explanations as you requested. His headquarters are now at Strasburg. General Shields is expected to move to-morrow. I feel it to be my duty to say that he ought not to withdraw until the movements of the enemy are more clearly developed. A few days' detention even would greatly add to the security of the valley. There is nothing new to report of the enemy.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

MIDDLETOWN, June 20, 1862-8 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

My headquarters are at Middletown. To-morrow will move nearer Front Royal, where my command now is. General Fremont is at Strasburg. There is nothing new to report of the enemy. General Shields moves to-morrow. I thought it was determined when I left Washington that he would remain. It would add much to the security of the valley, and in my judgment it is necessary to the successful issue of your plans. I hope he may yet remain a few days at least.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

BALTIMORE, MD., June 20, 1862-8.20 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I shall leave in the morning at 6.30 for Harper's Ferry and Martinsburg. I have requested Major-General Sigel to meet me at one of these points, to make arrangements to meet coming events. I think it would be wise to concentrate troops between this and Washington. Railroad is now open to Winchester. After the conference I may send one or two regiments more from this place, depending, however, on circumstances, as I am not in favor of leaving Baltimore with too few troops.

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.

BALTIMORE, MD., June 20, 1862-12 p. m.
