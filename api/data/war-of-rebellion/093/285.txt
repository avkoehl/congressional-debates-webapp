instant, at daybreak, our columns again advanced, my regiment this day on the front line. The enemy had fallen back during the night about one mile, where they were found to be strongly fortified, with a temporary fortification about 300 yards in front of the main line. This my regiment, with the brigade, charged and carried and held till about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, when the main line was charged and carried, with many prisoners, small-arms, and some artillery. The routed enemy ran without consideration and were followed promptly a few miles, when the command was again bivouacked for the night.

My loss during the two days' engagement was 5 enlisted men wounded and 2 enlisted men missing.
