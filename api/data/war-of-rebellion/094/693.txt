Brigadier-General JACKSON,Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you withdraw all your forces at daylight in the morning, and concentrate on the Wilkinson pike at or near George Smith's. He has directed the infantry wagon train and the artillery wagons, three or four miles from the Nashville pike, up Stewart's Creek in the direction of Nolensville poke, and wishes your train placed there also to-morrow morning. The enemy attacked our line in several places to-day around Nashville, and at 2 o'clock were attempting to turn our left flank; hence his desire to concentrate all his force as rapidly as possible, and place it between the garrison at Murfreesborough and Nashville, Bell will be at or near mouth of Overall's Creek, on Stone's River, and the infantry brigades on the pike near the block-house.
