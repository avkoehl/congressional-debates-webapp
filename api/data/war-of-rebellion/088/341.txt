HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 20, 1864 - 2 p. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

The signal officer at Gibbon's house reports, at 12.30 p. m., a column of infantry, about 2,000 strong, moving out of Petersburg toward the enemy's right. About two hours ago he reported a brigade of enemy's infantry moving from Petersburg in same direction.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

Your dispatch of 1.50 p. m. received. Corse commands a brigade in Pickett's division, which has been doing all the operations in front of Bermuda Hundred. Probably this is the body of troops reported by the signal officer at Gibbon's house.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 20, 1864 - 2.40 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: I have examined James Crowley. He is an Irishman and talks singularly. He says he has no doubt they will give is a fight to-day to try and drive us out. He does not know anything about what he calls Corsair's [Corse's] division, of Beauregard's troops, but supposes they will use everything to get us away. His statement seems based upon his own opinions, and he is an ignorant fellow. I think, however, it is quite true that they will attack us, but I think we ought to be able to hold against everything. I am preparing to fight all around and not hold a long line so that our communications may be interrupted in case of an attack.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
