Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Your dispatch of the 12th is received. I have sent two brigades and a half to Wilmington, amounting to over 4,000 men. Orders from General Sherman, dated the 12th at Fayetteville, direct me to send an expedition of 2,500 men to Sumterville and Florence to destroy railroad stock and munitions. A copy of his dispatch is sent you by mail. * From General Grant's order of February 19, I judge that in case of a conflict of orders I must carry out General Sherman's.
