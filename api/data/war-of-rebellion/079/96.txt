General Kilpatrick on forwarding the deserter states:

I have sent scouting parties down Sandtown road in direction of Powder Springs, via Hunter's Ford and Sly's Mill and Ford. The rebel line runs from on Powder Springs road, this side of Most Mountain, to a point WEST of Powder Springs. Hardee has the right. We have nothing to fear from points south of Powder Springs.

General G. B. RAUM:

Two deserters have just come in from Cedar Bluff, twenty-eight miles WEST of here, on the Coosa; say that Wheeler's comand of cavalry was at Edwards's Ferry, four miles WEST of Cedar Bluff, at 11 a. m. to-day, and would cross to the south side of the Coosa to- night and in the morning. The say Wheeler is under orders to proceed to Lost Mountain, near Marietta, with all possible dispatch. The route Wheeler would travel would be by Cave Springs, Cedartwon, and Van Wert. One of ou scouts has just come in and corroborates the above, except he says that Jackson's DIVISION has gone back toward the railroad in direction of Resaca, and that the remained of the command is going to Lost Mountain.
