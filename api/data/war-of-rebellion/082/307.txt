CITY POINT, July 17, 1864 - 9.35 p.m.

Major-General BUTLER:

Several deserters just in on General Meade's front, who left the picket-line to-night, concur in the statement that we are t be attacked to-night. General Field visited their line just before they deserted, and they overheard him talking with a colonel on the details of the movement. They say it is conceded in their army that Johnston is gone, unless he can be re-enforced, and before they can re-enforce him we must be driven back. Have the Tenth and Eighteenth Corps duly notified, with caution, however, that they are t make no demonstration to show that we are expecting any such attack. Be prepared at the same time to take advantage of any abandonment by the enemy of this lines in your front, especially after daylight in the morning. Of course it is not known when the attack is to be, or whether it is to be at all, but we want to be prepared for the enemy if the should give us such an advantage.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, July 17, 1864.

(Received 11.30 p.m.)

Major-General BUTLER:

Since my dispatch to you two more sets of deserters have some in, confirming previous statements, but giving more particulars. The attack, if made, is to be principally on Meade's left. The deserters say that a ravine has been cleared out between the respective lines of skirmishers, for the purpose of massing their troops under cover and out of observation, and that the attack is to be made about 4 a.m., of just before day. I very much wish now that you had a corps ready to make an attack on the enemy at the same time. It will be advisable to have Kautz notified to have his cavalry on hand for service on foot.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

JULY 17, 1864 - 11.45 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Indeed I wish that corps was here. We shall open with artillery in full blast when they open on the left. Kautz had been notified to report to Brooks on foot before the receipt of you dispatch.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
