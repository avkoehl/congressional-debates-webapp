THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 13.
Under these circumstances your committee did
think that a decent respect tor their rights and
privileges, and much more for the dignity of that
body from which all their powers were derived,
might have induced the committee of directois
to forbear to make them feel an entire want of
control over their own room. With a previous
determination to be present when their books were
to be inspected, they could have waited to avow it
until those books were called for, and the attempt
made to inspect them in their absence. These
circumstances are now reviewed, because they
then excited an apprehension, which the sequel
formed into convic'ion, that this committee of
directors had been appointed to supei vise the acts
and doings of your committee, and to limit and
restrain their proceedings, not according to the
directions contained in the i esolution of the House,
but the will and judgment of the. board of di
lectors Youi committee have chosen to ascribe
the claim of the committee of directors, to sit con-
jointly with them, to the desire to prevent them
Irom making use of the books and papers for
the purposes pointed out by the resolution of the
House They are sensible that this claim to be
present at all examinations, avowed prematuiely,
and subsequently persisted in with peculiar per
unacity, could be attributed to very diffeient
motives, but respect for themselves, and respect
for the gentlemen who composed ti e committee
of directors, utterly forbids the ascription to them
of a feeling which would merit compassion and
contempt much more than resentment
This novel position,voluntarily and deliberately
taken by the committee of the directois, predicated
on an idea of equality of rights with your com
mitlee, under youi íesolution, rendered it proper
and, in some measure, necessary, that your com-
mutee should express us opinions of the relative
rights ot the corpoiation and the House of Repre
sentatives. To avoid all misunderstanding and
future misrepresentations, it was desirable that
each question should bedecided sepaiately Con-
templating an extended investigado , butunwd
ling that an apprehension should exi=t of improper
disclosuies being made of the transactions ot the
bank and us customers, your commi'tee, following
the exnmfle of the committee of 1832, adopted a
resolution declaring that their proceedings should
be confidential, until otherwise oideied by the
committee, and also a íesolution that the commitiee
would conduct its investigations " without the
presence of any person not required oi invited to
attend "
Copies of these resolutions were furnished to
the committee of directois, in the hope that the
executive control of u room at the bank, duitne; its
houisof business, would thereafter be conceded to
youi committee, while the claim of the committee
of duectors to be piesent when their books were
submitted for inspection, should be postponed for
decision, when the books were called for and
produced by them     (App A )
On the28 h ultimo this committee assembled at
the banking house, and again found the room they
expected to find set apart for their use, preoccu-
pied  bv the committee of directors, and otherb,
ofiicers of the bank     And instead of such assu-
l anees as they had a right to expect, they received
copies of two resolutions adopted by the boaid of
directors, in which they were given to understand
#that then continued occupation of the room must I
be considered a tavor and not a matter of right
and ¡n which the boaid indulge in unjust comment
anes on the resolution of the House of Represent
atives, and intimate* an apprehersion that your
committee  design  to  make their  examinations
secret, partial, unjust, oppiessive, and contrary to
common right     (App  A )
When this communication had been read, your
committee adjourned to meet at their own cham-
bei, at the North American Hotel   Notwithstand
i-i¿all that had occur! ed, the correspondence with
the committee of dnectois was continued     If in
so doing an erioi was committed, let it be imputed
to the belief that great forbeaiance well became the I
committee of the immediate Representatives of i
the peop'e     (App  A )
While it was thus doubtful whether a room
could be obtained in the banking house, without
conditions being attached deiogatory to the rights
and dignity of the House, and a concession in
advance of a claim setup by the bank, which might
seriously incommode your committee m their busi-
ness, they determined to execute your resolution,
if practicable, without intruding on the directors
of the bank, they therefore lequired of the piesi-
dent and duectors, in writing, to submit, for the
inspection of the committee, at their committee
room on the Sd day of May, certain books and
papers of the bank, which might have been thus
produced without interruption to the ordinary
business of the bank The lequisiuon, m teims
in-phed the presence of the directors or their com-
mittee.
On the day named, the board addressed a writ-
ten communication to the committee, declaring
" that they cannot comply with that part of the res
' olution ot the Committee of inves 'gation which
1 requires that certain books of the bank be sent to
1 the North American Hotel, this day, at eleven
1 o'clock "    (App   B )
Your committee are of opinion that this refusal
of the board of duectors to submit the books of
the bank to the inspection of your committee, 13
| a violation of the bank charter, and a contempt of
the laws and autnonty ot the House of Repre-
senlatives
i     The reasons foi this opn ion need not be here
I repeated oi enlarged
It has been maintained,and is insisted, that the
right to inspect the books of the bank carries ftith
it the power to peiform that office out of the
bankino- house, if it cannot be done conveniently
and effectually therein, and your committee can-
not perceive that jus' giound of complaint exists
against a claim of power, in a committee of either
House of Congress, which, by the laws, and with
a wise íegard to the public interests, is conceded
to the judicial tribunals of both the Federal and
State Governments
The tacts al.eady stated demonstrate that a
room could not be procuied in the bank for the
use of the committee, without a concession not to
be recal'ed, which would have made your com-
mittee dependent on the courtesy of the directors
of the bank at every s*ep of the inquiry, and the
various communications received from the direct-
ors and their committee, annexed to this report,
will fully corroborate this statement
Having failed to pccomplish the object of pro-
curing the books of the bank for inspection, at
their committee room, your committee felt i' tobe
their duty to demand their submission foi that
purpose, at the bank, of the piesident and cashier
of the bank, the usual and general agents of the
corpoiation Tor thit purpose, on the 5 h day of
May, having appnzed the committee oí directors
of their intention, at one o'clock they repined to
tne bamc, and then required the president and
cashier, each of them i espectively, to produce cer-
tain cf the books of the bank foi inspection of the
committee This was íefused by each of those
officeis, for reasons stated m writing, and to be
found in the appendix to this report     (App  C)
Inth siefusal, voui committee believe there was
a substantial violation of the bank charter, and a
contempt against the authority of the House com-
mitted
They are of opinion, that your committee were
und er ro obligation of right to recognise any agent
of the bank other than those generally known as
such, and make their duty and light to inspect the
books depend on the convenience or caprice of
such deputation
If such be the fact, then the examinations of
the bank will, in all cases, depend on the disposi-
tion of the directois to have the r proceedings
examined
Having been thus denied, by the officers of the
bank, and having been informed by the directors,
that they were not awaie of hav ng declined to
furnish a room for the exclusive use of the com
mittee, your committee, sincerely desnous to meet
the wi^hesand dneohonsof the House, helieved it
to be their duty to seek another interview with the
committee of directors, arc! by arnngement, met
the committee of the board, at the bank, on the
seventh day of May, at an hour fixed by them-
selves
Yr-ur committee then and there, m writing, re-
quired the committee of the board, to produce to
your committee, for inspection, certain books and
papers of the bank, to enable your committee to
inquire into the truth of lepresentations made by
the Government duectors to the President of the
United States and to Congress, and to ascertain
whether the boaid of directors had violated the
charter of the banlt, I y authorizing the exercise of
illegal powers by then committees or officers, and
whether the bank had any agency, thiough its
management oi money, in producing the present
pressure, or has used its corporate power or money
to control the press, to mteifere in politics, or
influence elections
Without giving a specific answer to these calls
for books and papers, the committee cf directora
presented a wntten communication, which was
said to be " indicative of the mode of proceeding
deemed right by the bank "
The committee of the board in that communica-
tion, expiess the opinion, that the inquiry can
only be rightfully extended to alleged violations of
the charter, and deify virtually the right of the
House of Repi esentatn es to authorize the inquiries
requited in the resolution
'1 hey also teq ui ed of the Committee of Investi-
gation, " when they asked for books and papers,
' to state specifically in writing, the purposes for
' which they are proposed to be inspected, and if
' it be to establish a violation of the charter, then
' to state specifically in writing, what are the
' alleged or supposed violations of the charter, to
' winch the evidence is alleged to be applica-
ble "
To this extraordinary requirement, made on the
supposition thatyourcommitteewerecharged with
the duty of crimination, or piosecution for crim-
inal offence, and imp'ying a right on the part of
the directors to determine foi what purposes the
inspection should be made, and what books or
papers should be submitted to inspection, your
committee replied, that they were not chaiged with
the duty of criminating the bank, its directors, or
otheis, but simply to inquire, amongst other
things, whether any prosecution in legal form,
should be instituted, and from the nature of their
duties, and the instructions of the House of Rep-
resentatives, they were not bound to state specifi-
cally in writing any charges against the bank, or
any special purpose for which they required the
production of the books and papers for inspection.
A specific answer was lequired to the calls which
had been made
The committee of the board, after deliberation,
made a communication to your committee, in
wilting, in which they announced their purpose
to adheie to their resolution, and refused to sub-
mit the books and papéis of the bank, lequired by
your committee to be produced for their inspec-
tion
These calls were made in the bank, and m the
presence of the committee of the board, and then
and there a compliance with them was refused.
Not feeling authorized to regard this unexpected
and unequivocal refusal as the act of the board of
directors, your committee submitted the proceed-
ings of their committee to the board, and they
were by the board "fully approved and sanc-
tioned "   (App  D )
In this act of retusal, which nothing that had
occuried had prepared them to anticipate, your
committee are of opinion that the charter of the
bank wis violated, and a contempt of the author-
ity of the House of Representatives committed
Youi commttee, acting under the instructions
of the House of Representatives, without power
to modify or enlaige them, charged to inquire, and
not authorized to accuse orto arraign, except in
their report to the House itself, armed with but
the hmited authority of a committee, unauthorized
to punish, were necessanly compelled to the con-
clusion, that, in the faceof theobstructionsalready
detailed, they could not efficiently prosecute the
inquiries with wl ich they were charged, without
the aid of the powei of the House of Representa-
tites
Anxious, however, to perform their duty with-
out complaint to the Houi>e, and in confoimity
with the proceedngs of the committee of investi-
garon of 1819 and 1832, youi committee called
on the bank, in a series of resolutions, *o furnish
statements, and certain extiacts and copies from
their books and papers, which, in the opinion of
your committee, were all intimately connected
with their duties, and many of them indispensable
