I respectfully reiterate my request for definite instructions, believing that I have demonstrated that there is no enemy in front who can be attacked by this expedition, and also that it is impossible to stay here long. I shall stay here, if possible, until I receive an answer to this dispatch.

Very respectfully, yours,

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major General, Commanding.

GENERAL: I received yesterday and this morning the duplicate dispatch of the 22nd instant from the commanding general. A division will be sent to New Iberia in a few days. Two regiments of that division will at once be sent to New Iberia, to replace two other regiments, which will be ordered to go to New Orleans. I think I shall hold my advance in the vicinity of Carrion Crow Bayou, as by taking that position I can get forage more easily, and the supply of provisions can be kept up. I do not quite understand from the dispatch whether the commanding general wishes me to keep up that supply, or whether I shall let the wagons be emptied. I shall take measures to have the supply kept up, however, and in the meantime will be glad to be informed on that point. Colonel Chandler has written Colonel Holabird and Captain Vallance to get things in readiness for keeping us supplied from New Iberia.

There is difficulty in sweeping the country between the Teche and Mississippi from this point as a base. The bayous are hard to cross, and a rain makes the road impracticable. New Iberia would be a better point to start from than any point farther to the front. I doubt whether there are many good horses in the country. I, however, have sent out a cavalry force this morning in that direction.

Very respectfully, yours,

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major-General, Commanding.

GENERAL: I have received the two communications from you and that from the commanding general. I have been obliged to return to this place, Carrion Crow Bayou, on account of scarcity of forage and doubt about supplies. The roads are getting exceedingly bad. One of the objects which you suggest will be attained by building a bridge across the Mermenton. As soon as possible this will be done. Please order the telegraph laid to Vermillion, where I go with the Nineteenth Corps to-morrow, leaving the Thirteenth here. The cavalry will be divided the posts.

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major-General, Commanding.
