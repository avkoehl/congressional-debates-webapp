of the 24th instant do not seem to meet such cases, and I respectfully suggest that if compatible with the public interests your orders be modified so as to include the class of men referred to. The agents of substitute brokers from Erie, Pa., Buffalo, N. Y., and other places are said to be quietly at work in this city enticing soldiers already in the service to doff their clothes and clothe themselves in citizens" dress and go East to enter as substitutes. Our policemen about the depot report these abuses after the parties have taken the trains and are beyond the limits of the State.

Colored men are brought here as contrabands and then carried off to fill the quotas of other States, because provost-marshals, &amp;c., have no instructions on the subject.

Very respectfully, yours,

LAZ. NOBLE,

Adjutant-General of Indiana.
