Among these were several officers of eminent worth and services, whose names are mentioned in the reports of brigade commanders.

I desire to express my high appreciation of Brigadier-Generals Brown, Bate, and Clayton, and of their respective commands. Representing the three States of Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee, they vied with each other in deeds of high and noble daring. The Confederacy has nowhere braver defenders led by more skillful commanders.

It is due to the several members of my staff that I should acknowledge my obligations for their invaluable services, and record my estimate of their personal bearing and conduct in the field.

Major R. A. Hatcher, assistant adjutant-general, than whom there is not a more active or faithful officer in the service, displayed throughout his usual intelligence, promptness, and cool courage.

Major John C. Thompson, assistant inspector-general, and Lieutenant T. H. Cahal, acting assistant inspector-general, were conspicuous for their zeal and disregard of danger.

Major J. W. Eldridge, chief of artillery, discharged his duties with energy and skill, bringing the artillery into play on the few occasions where it was practicable with judgment and success.

My two aides-Lieutenants Bromfield Ridley, jr., and R. Caruthers Stewart-though very young men, and the latter under fire for the first time, behaved with commendable gallantry.

On Saturday I was also well served by Mr. John E. Hatcher, a volunteer aide, and Private John M. House, a clerk in the adjutant-general's office.

To Chief Surg. G. B. Thornton, and the medical inspector, Dr. G. W. Burton, I am indebted for the good care of the wounded and the excellent hospital arrangements provided under their supervision, and for their unremitting attention to their duties.

Under the management of Captain J. W. Stewart, ordnance officer, supplies of ammunition were always promptly at hand when needed, and affairs were managed to my entire satisfaction in their respective departments by Majors John A. Lauderdale, assistant quartermaster, and J. D. Cross, acting commissary of subsistence, who are among the most faithful and energetic officers of their branches of service.
