the staff officers accordingly. I think such articles had better be removed toward Lynchburg.

It has been snowing all day, and I fear that our men, with insufficient clothing, blankets, and shoes, will suffer much, and our ranks be proportionably diminished. The enemy's strength will, however, decrease the farther he removes from his base, and I hope an opportunity will offer for us to strike a successful blow.

I beg that you will urge forward the defenses and preparations at Richmond, and collect all the force you can.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,November 7, 1862.

P. S. ROLLER, Esq., Mount Crawford, Va.:

SIR: I have received the communication, * signed by yourself and other citizens of Rockingham County, on the subject of prices paid for flour by the commissary of this army. When the army entered the valley, the chief commissary, Colonel Cole, endeavored to fix a fair price upon wheat and flour by taking the opinions of persons interested in those articles, and whose judgment it was believed would abe acquiesced in by the people generally. I am informed that the price for produce that would be likely otherwise to be taken by the enemy without compensation. The ground of your complaint, that higher prices are given at Staunton and other places by the agents of the Commissary Department at Richmond, who were purchasing in the valley, did not originate in any order issued by me or by the chief commissary of this army. I have written to the Secretary of War to-day on the subject, and suggested that a uniform price be fixed for wheat and flour taken for the army either under authority of the Commissary-General or by the chief commissary of this army.

You will please communicate the contents of this letter to the other gentlemen who united with you in signing the communication to myself.

I omitted to mention that I was informed that the price fixed for flour was $2 per barrel more than had been paid before the army entered the valley.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
