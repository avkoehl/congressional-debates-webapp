Major C. H. RAYMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: Squad sent over river last night returned after gaining all the information I expected. Am satisfied there is not, nor has not been, infantry about Leesburg recently. Some of Mosby's men have been about Dranesville and vicinity, as I reported. One Lowe, formerly a rebel lieutenant, living two or three miles from river, opposite Seneca Falls, I was informed, had two portable distilleries, and distil for Mosby's and White's men. This squad found one secreted in the woods in a ravine, and demolished it. Are your headquarters informed of a rebel militia organization at Dranesville?

Respectfully,

JNO. M. WAITE,

Major, Commanding.
