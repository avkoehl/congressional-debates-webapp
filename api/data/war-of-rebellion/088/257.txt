be well to land mortars. The enemy are greatly strengthening their armament near the salient, and with guns of large caliber. As much of your train as can be quickly removed in case of necessity should be put in battery.

Major-General BIRNEY,

Commanding Tenth Corps:

GENERAL: I am instructed by the major-general commanding to say that last evening he directed certain dispositions to be made of the troops under your command, and a report to be made of such action. He has not been advised of what has been done in the matter, and desires to know the arrangement of your troops, and whether the brigades loaned you are in position on the line or so that they can be called away easily if required.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANCIS A. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

The brigade of the Second Division, Second corps, is posted on the left of General Foster, in close connection with its own division on its left. The brigade of the First Division, Second Corps, is on the right of Brigadier-General Birney, connecting on its right with Brigadier-General Miles and reporting to him. Colonel Craig's brigade is on my line, and can be taken away this morning; last night it was disorganized. Colonel Smyth's brigade reports to him and is on his own line.

Yours, respectfully,

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
