payments for more than twenty j eais From these
iacts, we are not authorized to conclude that a
similar national institution in this country would
be able to afford the Government or the people a
sound currency, or the necessary fiscal aid, m the
time ol our gieatest need
In regard to the passage of the bill ander consi-
deration, we are met, by gentlemen opposed to it,
with the objection that it is " anothei experiment "
It is true, sir, that the collection, safe keeping, and
disbursement of the public levenue, exclusively
through the officers and agents of the Govern-
ment, has- not been sufficiently practised in this
country to give it the sanction ot our own expe-
rience But though it ma) be new heie, it is rot
so in some of the mo t enlightened Governments of
the world It ha1! been long tried, witn success, in
England and France In the former, the pub-
1 c revenue it. gathered fiom the people by a
class of oiheers called collector;, and distributors
of stamps When so collected, it is paid over to
a superior class of officer called leceivers general,
by whom it is paid into the Exchequer, where
nothing is received but cash, or what is, bv
law lecogmsed as such The funds, thus received,
are kept m the Exchequer, and disbursed by the
officers oí the Tie?sury This system has been so
long pursued in England where they have a na-
tional bank, that it must be regarded as the highest
evidence of its successful operation In France a
similar practice prevails There, too, the laxes of
different kinds are collected by local officers, m
specie, or Government drafts, v hich are deemed
equivalent, and paid over to creditor", or local pay-
master; or receive! s The residue is remitted to
Paris undei direction of a propel othcei, and theie
kept in Exchequer chest'- It appears then, sir, it
this be an "experiment, it has been well tried,
and, as the highest evidence of lis approtal, it is
still emu tied by Governments having the full ad-
vantage of all the lights of experience If it has
been successiul with them, it is not unreasonable
to conclude it will  eventuate m like manner here
The piovisions of the bill, now on its passage,
Mr President, embrace every guaid and guaranty,
for the security of the public treasure, and its
honest and faithful disbursement, which could bo
devised Under them, I believe, these desuablc
objeats will be accomplished AVith ti ese views,
of this important n easuie, I feel bound to give it
my support

REMARKS   OF MR   1HOMAS,
Op Marylímj,
in the House of Rtpi esentalives, September —, 1837—
In leply to remarks ot  Mr Biddia, concerning
a bankrupt law
Mr 1HOMAS did not rise to participate m
the discursive debate wMch had been invited by
i he speech of the gentleman flora Pennsylvania,
(Mi Biddle ) His attention had been attracte 1 by
tne closing remaiks of that gentleman, and he
■uoild do now, what he had desiied to oo a lew
days since, and submit to the House, and to the
countij a brief explanation, due to the commit-
tee ol which he had the hono- to be Ihe chairman
■When tie .rmt em m fi >m Pennst,i\ari i litn U -
fore tailed on tin cli arman ol ine Judicial} C >m-
mittee, to respond to certain inquiries, Mr T was
about to give a full and detailed reply, but was
warned by the Chair that such a proceeding would
not be in older Subsequently, a resolution de-
claring that it is inexpedient to report a bankiupt
law at this special session of Congress, was adopt-
ed m ihe committee, and it became his dutj to pre-
sent it to this House Aller the resolution had
been agreed to by the committee, he inquired of the
members piesent whether he should otate to the
House the reas >ns by which they had been influ-
enced, and \x i« told, that it would be most agiee t-
b e to all concerned lo ha\e the concluson ihe^
had come to -nnounced witnrut comment Tins
w is accordingly done
The manner m which these proceedings haie
been adverted to b> the gpntlemai, calls for a few
wolds in explanation, to guard against mi appre-
hension
There has beci no purpo e to di.gu sp the opi-
nions of the Judiciary Commutee, oi tf an> oí i's
member^, on the grate subject committed lo ihe r
consideration The members hat e been fiank with
each other it the coinmitlec reo n ant'hpte nr th-
ing to conceal Iroii tins House, or iiom their con-
stituents It s to be hoped ll at no rrrn supposes
that they have sought to avoid a dft-ct decision on
any question tnat could be at thi^ time, with pro-
priety, dispos-d of At ihe i first ire  nig, no opi-
nion could be toinW as 'o ihe piobabie duiatioa of
the present session oí Congress It it was to be
ettended bcvoi d the fust Monday or December,
pmple time would be aiioided to ct upon the busi-
ness t) be lepoitedby the CommitUeoJ "Wa\s and
Means, and also to establish a uní irm system oí
bankiuptcv But il tne session was to b* closed
betoie lhat penod, and in time for members lo go
home, and leturn again, all foresaw that the whoie
time of the House would be eng'ossed b> the mci-
surca expected 1'on the Committee of Wijs aid
Means Undei lhe e impre ions, tlecormntee
determined not to act upon the ir-ttei rehired ij
them, unt 1 the) could bo s-uished ih it ihe Houst
would take that subject into serious co isidei-itio
at the presert session Aftei it h*d bcei ascr-i-
latm d lhat the present sessu nttm Id not 1 e blenrk d
\\ ith the reg llai session ot Congress, ihe com mtt^e
giin assemb ed, ah the membeis ben a present but
one, i,Mr Hoffman )    A  motion was made (hat
the committee be discharged front the consideration
of the policy ol establishing a uniform system o£
bankruptcj This pioposition was iejected^-fcr it- *
two, against it six votes The resolution declaring i
it to be inexpedient fo report a bankrupt bill at the
presen t session was then adopted without opposition.
These part culars uie given, that the public may
see that a decided majority of the committee are
disposed to examine lurthei at the next session,
if that duty should be imposed upon them, into
the propriety of exercising the powers conferred
on Congress respecting bankruptcies
The establishment of a uniform sjstem on that
subject is now a work of gieat difficulty and delica-
cy í he people of the several States have been
long accustomed to insolvent systems, differing
essentially irom each other If an attempt is to be
made o supersede them by a general law of the
United Slates, it is certainly desirable that ample
opportunity should be first afforded for a full de-
velopment of public opinion on the subject Since
the Message oi the President, and the report of the
Secretaiy, was referred, a very short time ha.3
elapsed Notu lthslandmg tin , if the committee
had supposed tnat theie exis'ed any necessity what-
ever for spei dv action, they would doubiless have
proceedt d «i'h the lights already before them But
this is manifestly not the case We have been in-
vited b> the President and the Secretary of the
Treasury to exnloie the power granted to this i3ro-
veenment concerning bankruptcies, to see whether
we can not, in a mtnner authorized by the Con-
stitution, impose some salutary check upon
tne l^sue of paper money, and guard against
I a lecunence of that great catastrophe which
, has inundated the whole cjuntry with a
dcpieciated curienc} The evil to be íemedied
I pons out of the insmamge nent of the banking
coronations c taud bj th" s-\eii' ^ ales Now,
w nether me operations of a bankrupt system is to
be extended to banks already m existence, or only
to such as may be hereafter created, there can be
no necessity for hasty action It is not probable
that any State will, under existing circumstances,
crea'e any moie institutions similar to those
whose daik bodies now cloud the landscape of
' the whole Union, and whose misconduct and
misfoitunes ha\e prompted a thorough examina-
tion into all the powers of this Government,
to discover, if possible, some means to make
them respect our fixed policy, and ?ct n stuct
suboidnaion 1 eicafier lo the laws of tne rand.
NLnhei is it prolnble that Congress would be
inclined to suoject existing banks, without delay,
lo the optia ions of a bank law Time ought to
be gi\cn to tnese institutions, on account of their
numerous s ockholders and debtors, to reciver
fiom the dilemma into which thev have fallen.
Before v- e unritrtal e to enforce i pew rule of
morals, altering c-sentnlly the pact policy ot the
country, till p irt es to be affected should have
time lo pieparc for the change In no eient, then,
en there be a necess ty for acting on the re-
i com neni'aiion 11 the Piisdtnt, ci netrnmg banks,
' at the piesent session At the re„i.l r ses-
sim it can le dclioera ely oi posed ot with-
j out i! íustice to any inercst m oteJ More-

ihe 1 re i len , nor ihe report of he Sectetary, refer-
red lo me co urn t ee, contains any proposiuon to

ed lhat they vou'd rot hate met the e\pectalicns
an 1 ícq mements of the country, if the) had report-
ed a b 11 applicable to banking corporations alone.
Between tie close of this aid the commencement
