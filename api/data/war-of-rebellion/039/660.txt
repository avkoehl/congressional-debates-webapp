and the responsibility for the disaster be fairly apportioned. For this and nothing else have I asked, and I shall urge this with all possible energy. Although under all other circumstances I should be willing to go to some other theater of war, under these circumstances I am satisfied with my command as it is and where it is. I consider it a duty to myself and my men to stand right here until the mist that hangs over the events of the 2nd of May is cleared up.

Besides, I had a conversation with General Hooker, in the course of which this subject was incidentally touched, and he pronounced himself decidedly opposed to my going, either without or with my troops.

I am, general, most respectfully, yours,

C. SCHURZ,

Major-General.

General Schurz expressed in a conversation with me on the 19th instant his desire to go with his division to some other army. I wondered at it at the time. I believe that it would militate against him and his command to be transferred at this juncture. I withdraw my request, and will make every effort to reconcile all difficulties arising from the different nationalities in this command.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
