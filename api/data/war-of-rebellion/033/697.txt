SPRINGFIELD, MO., November 7, 1863.

General DAVIES:

My information is that there is quite a rebel force at Salem, Fulton County, Arkansas, and increasing daily. I have a good force in the southeast portion of my district. Would it not do well for you to send a force, if you can spare it, into the southwestern portion of your district, and together drive out this force? My force is daily advancing,and they may leave, anyway.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWESTERN MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., November 7, 1863.

Colonel HARRISON,

Commanding Fayetteville, Ark.:

You will send about one-half of your command, under a competent and energetic officer, to Huntsville, with the view of permanently occupying that place, with instructions to the officers sent in command to use all reasonable efforts to clear that section of country from armed rebels, and protect, to the fullest extent, peaceable citizens. The command will supply itself with forage from that section of the country, and such other supplies as the country affords. I think three pieces of artillery will be sufficient to send.

If, in your opinion, there are objections to this movement at present, you will so inform me before executing the order, stating what the objections are, and wait for an answer from me.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
