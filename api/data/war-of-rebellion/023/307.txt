Reliable intelligence just receive from --- and --- at Knoxville that the enemy has 60,000 at that place and that additional troops are arriving. The enemy is advancing upon Kentucky.

Major-General HALLECK:

General Morgan telegraphs me reliable intelligence, just received from persons whom he does not wish named, that enemy has 60,000 men at Knoxville and that additional troops are arriving. The enemy is advancing on Kentucky. The troops come from Virginia and Georgia. He asks is it not probable that Richmond and Chattanooga are evacuated. It is true that the main force has been moved east from Chattanooga.

Brigadier-General BOYLE:

If possible, re-enforce Richmond and London. The enemy has from 12,000 to 15,000 in my front and 60,000 at Knoxville. He will probably invade Kentucky by way of Jamestown and Big Creek Gap.
