Surgeon General's Office,<7k/3/ 3,1838
Sir In obedience to your instructions, I have examined the
speech of Mr Bond of Ohio, so far as it relates te this office,
and have the honor to report, that the regular salary of the
clerk employed m this office is the same as. was received by
him in 1828, viz 81,160 per annum, to which 10 per cent was
added, during the last year, by an act of Congress, making
81,265 per annum, and not $1,266 as stated in the speech re
fenedto, this addition of 10 pel cent continues to the adjourn-
ment of the present session of Congress
Fiom the organization of this office a sergeant from the army
was employed to perform the duties of messenger, until 1836,
when, by an act appioved on the 4th of July of that year, pro
vision was made foi a messenger in lieu of the sergeant,whose
salaiy is $500 per annum, and to which 20 per cent was added
by the act of Congress of the 3d of Maich, 1837, referíed to
when stating ihe salary of the clerk, se that the actual diffe
rt-nce consists m paying the messenger by specific appropria
tion, instead of his being paid fiom the army appropriation, as
was the case when a sergeant was employed
I have the honor to be,

this office been examined, and I have the honor to íeport, that

whose joint compensation was $2 950, and
In 1838, the Subsistence Department employs four cleiks,

By the 1st section of the act of 9th May, 1836, the employment
of non commissioned officers in any of the offices of the De

ask compensation for a messenger to be paid out of the appro
priation for the civil list

rations to certain inhabitants m Florida," the Secretary of War
directed that a special account should be kept m this office of
the issues under that resolution, the permanent force in the of
free being insufficient for that purpose, in addition to their other
duties, it became necessary to employ a clerk to attend espe-
cially to that business, whose annual compensation was fixed

ríes of the clerks m this office, should approximate as nearly
as practicable, those of clerks employed m the civil bureaus, as
he was particulaily aware, that the salaries previously paid,
were inadequate to the services rendered, and the responsibility
attached to the situations, but m every instance where compen
satiun to clerks or messenger m this office has been paid, it
has been done invariably undei acts passed by Congress itself,
except m thetwo instances above mentioned.

Th'sls stated in a note in the Blue Book, page 91, to which Mr
B evidently had refei red
Assertion No 4—In 1828, iheiewere twenty-one Indian
Anents, (three at $1,800 six at $1 500, one at $1 400, five at
$1,300, six at $1,200, see State papel s, 2d session 20th Congress,
3d vol Doc 117, page 7 ) and twenty eight sub agents In 1833,
ten Indian Agents at$l 500, and foiuteen sub agents at $750
Fact—In 1838, there aie but eight Indian Agent  exelusiveof
the two acting as Superintendents, and whom Mr B has count
ed as such
In 1828, the appropriations foi the Superintendents and Indian
Agents was $31,000—In 1838 it is $16,500
In 1828 the appropriation for sub agents was $15,100—In 1885
it is 813,000
In 1838 the number of inteipreters at agencies is eight less
than in 1828 The average pay of an interpreter in 1828 was
$100 per annum, (see Blue Book for that year,) making the ag
gregate compensation of the thirty nine employed in that j ear
$15,600 —Appiopnation in 1838, $9,300
Assertion No 5 —In 1838 we hear of a commissioner whose
salary is $3 000, and 12 clerks and two messengcis, whose joint
compensation is $19,400
Tact —In 1828, Governor Cass and General Clark, at the in
vitation of the Secretary of War, prepared a report containing,
among other things, " a code of regulations foi the government
of the (Indian) Department, and for the general administration
ofits afluís " This was in the form of a bill The first section
provided foi the appointment of a commissioner at $3,000, the
second prescubed his duties the third1 related to the number of
cleiks, the fourth gave him the franking privilege, and the fifth
authsnzed the employment ef a messenger These five sections
are stated to "contain substantially the provisions of a bill re
ported by the Committee on Indian Allans* m the House of Re
presentatives at the fiist session of the same Congress "—(See
State Papeis2J session of the 20th Congress, Vol 3d, Doc 117,
p 4) This report was submitted ta Congress by the Secretary
ofWar, " witharespec ful but earnest recommendation "
The number of elorks now en ' ved m the Indian office is
12 The number in 1828 was 4 I 1S30 1 was added, m 1831
another, and tn 1832 a messenger In the latter year, tne busi
nessof emigration was committed to the Commissary General
who employed 5, and a messenger In 1836, 2 were authorized
bv law to be employed on the business of Indian reservations
The increase wasoccasioned in 1830 and 1831 by the passage of
the act of May 28th, 1830 pi m ldins for an exchange of lands,
an 1 the treaty of September27th 1830 with the Choctaws, ac
cording to the stipulations of which then íemoval was imme
diately commenced The provisions in the same treaty, m that
with the C eks;ofMaich21 1832 and with the ChiUtasaws m
1832 and 1834 granting reserves fo individuals ai d heids of
families, to the number of about 10 000, and which weie the first
provisions of tne kind to any extent, authouzedm the judgment
* So, then, It appears that this'Indian Department, with its
Commissioner at $3,000, clerks, and messengers, was .first pro
posed by a Whigcommittee, unaer a Whig administration, m
the very year 1^, when the business was not more than one
tiuri oí wto St W IW,
of Congress the employment o£ the other two in 1836 Thewfeele
number was 13                                                               1
The business ofemigratroa hasSeen transferredío (he Inthaít
Office, the number of clerks is 12, and th  number of messen-
gers is 2                                                                              '
Thus far for the Indian Department in the two years specified,
independent of treaty stipulations The expense- of superb
tendents, agents, sub ageois, and interpreters, in 1828, wa«
$61,970, ra ISaS, it is S38,800f lessm 1838, $237170. This is ex-
elusive of the compensation of the acting superintendents,
which, as has been shown, is $2,000 less than in 1828, making
the entire difference in favor of 1838, $25170 T
We now come to the composition of the Indian Bepartinent,
undeu^nd by virtue of treaty stipulations
Mr Baud enumerates 6 superintendents of emigration, 16
eondncting and enrolling agents, 2 valuing agents,«collecting
agents, 2 issuing agents, 16 assistant agents, 15 physicians, 11
clerks, 14 interpreters, ^conductors of exploring parties
Remajrk —These are all engaged ra the business of emigra-
tion As no agents of either of these classes are stated to have
been employedm 1828, or prior thereto, the impression willna-
rurally be that none were employed
Fact —In the treaty with the Creeks of January 24, 1826,
were stipulations for the valuation of their improvements, for
their removal and subsistence, valuing, collecting, enrolling,
conducting, and issuing agents were employed The number
of each class, and the pay of each, cannot be ascertained with-
out reference to the Auditor's Office, -and a long examination,
the fact of their employments proved by the correspondence in
the Indian Office Some appointments of the same kind were
also made under the treaty with the Cherokees of May 6,1828
Remark —The treaty with the Choctaws of SeptemSer 27,
1830, was the first under which emigration took plat  exten
sively; and it wasnot until the following year that it commenced
with much vigor under that with the Cherokees of 1828, and it
was in 1831 that, for thefirst time, regulations were prescribed
which gavefoim and system tothehusiness of removal. These
provided for the employment of the diffetent classes of agents
above enumerated, and fixed their compensation These were
not only approved by the President, but, slightly -revised, have
been appended to the reports from the Indian Office for tie last
yeai
For the reasonableness of them, consider the number of In
chans to be removed, ana the stipulations to be fulfilled. Since
the beginning of 1828, sixty four treaties have been made with
Indians OCtl\&Bet thirty-four provided for the removal of the
Indians, the valuation of their improvements, stock:, &c and
their subsistence for twelve months at their new homes, kit-
ing, in different sections of the country, different sets of agents
were necessarily employed, the number m each oase bemg
graduated with regard to the number of Indians, and the amount
of service to be rendered Tor the removal of the larger tribes,
ageneral superintendent was essential as the only means of
preserving harmony and subordination among the other agents,
and among the Indians, and of ensuring unity of action All
responsibility was devclved upon him To him was commit
ted the selection, in the first instance, of all the other persons to
be employed, and also the power to suspend them from duty,
and upon bis requisitions alone weie the disbursing officers,
military and civil, to make payments Toi this responsibility,
and !us vanous «nd numerous services, $2000 will not be con
sidered too laige a compensation The six named by Mr Bond
as m the service in 1838, are General Smith, superintendending
the removal of the Cherokeesj numbering 18,000, Maj Upshur,
the removal of the Chickasaws, 5,580, Colonel Pepper, the re-
moval of the Pottawatomies, Ottowas, and Chippewak 6,7C0;
Colonel Sands, discontinued, and duty transferred te Pepper
There are, therefore, three at $2,000, neither of whom will bftm
service, pTobably, at the close of the preaent yearyas all ifeese
Indians will be removed There is one ether at five dollars a
day, collecting straggling Choctaws m Mississippi, whose em-
ployment is temporary, and the sixth, who received the same
pay, has been discharged
Of the fifteen enrolling and conducting agents, five are em-
ployed among the Pottawatomies, Ot owas, ana Chippewas,
five among the Chickasawb, and fhe among the Cherokees,
whose services will terminate before those of the superintend-
ents The enrolment must exhibit the name of each head of a
family, and the number jra eatái family, to be a¿certai«ed by
personal inquiries through the nation, and it is required to re-
gulate the issues of rations on the route, and payments and
subsiuteneeafter their arrival west. The conductor has charge
of the movement of a party, directs the issues of provisions,
the transportation of the sipk, and of the baggage, &c and is
held accountable for the delivery of the party to the agent of
the Government west of the Mississippi The interpreters are
as necessaiy in the emigration as at the agencies, their com
pensation is higher, to cover the expenses of travelling The
employment of physieiansis required by humanity, anathe ex-
pel íence with the earlier emigrants would not justify the Go
\ eroment m refusing to employ them,, merely to avoid the ex
pense Foui af the phvsieians enumerated by Mr Bond are
provided for m treaties, two m that with the WmriebagoeSjOf
September, 1832, and two in that v¡ ith the Ottowas ana Chip-
pewas, of March28,1836 in both the pay is fixed Conductors
of explonng partiesare aho employed under treatyjstipulaaons.
Mi Bond says " We find thirty three comnussoners and
special agents "
Remark Of the thirty three, twelve were employed
undei resolutions or laws of Congress, directing negotiations,
or the examination of claims, six to execu -~ treaty arucles, and
one conducted an exploring party, forwhich the appiopnation
was made at the suggestion of the Committee on Indian Affairs
mlhe Senate Of the remaining foui teen, ten wereemployed
by the express requirement of laws or treaties, two to execute
treaty articles, one to conciliate the wild fribos of the pranies,
and bring deputations of them to Washington, and the last is
the district attorney in Florida, charged-with temporaiyduty,
having in view the removal of the Apalachico'as Of the
thiiry three, there is but one not authorized and required by re
solution, law, or treaty, and that one has been employed to
t There is also another consideration. The approfr 
lions for the Indian Department proper, in 1838, were «nuer
four heads—pay of superintendents and agents, pay of e o-
agents, piesents, and contingencies The amount under tne
latter was $95,000, Which was applied at the discretion of ¡lie
Department, and am of K; seer* paid smtttje, farmers, mterpre
ters, and any body the. Department might choose to esipjpy.
In 1838 the approptiations are specific, based on ism ttt 
trnries, and the «Mim«*i for wJncii  te mttttt* «n<J íp.
