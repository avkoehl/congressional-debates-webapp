Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

DEAR SIR: Yours of the 5th instant, improperly mailed to Milledgeville, was forwarded to me and received yesterday. I feel very deeply the importance of the object which it seeks to accomplish, and would gladly do anything in my power to aid you. But, my dear sir, it is useless to make an effort to induce the people general to part with their surplus at schedule prices. Wheat is worth in al our markets from $15 and $30 per bushel; corn, $10 to $15, and bacon, $3. 50 to $4 per pound. Compared with these figures the schedule prices are simply absurd. I have known for weeks that you could not get supplies in Georgia in sufficient quantities at these prices, and several weeks ago I addressed a letter* to the Secretary of the Treasury, which I authorized him to show you. If you have not see it I would be glad if you would ca call on him for it. It will put you fully in possession of my poor opinions on this subject. My opinion is that you should entirely disregard the schedule pieces and authorize your agents to buy supplies at any price, and should the planters refuse to sell impress peremptorily at prices approximating the marked value. It is idle too expect to feed our armies at the prices fixed by commissioners. it is wrong in principle and policy to compel citizens to part with their property at mere nominal rates. It will discourage production to a fatal degree and produce deep and widespread discontent toward the Government. Our producing territory is now so circumscribed that it will require great skill and industry to compel it to yield the requisite supplies under the most stimulating encouragement of remunerating prices. It will utterly fail to do so if the planters feel that they are to pay heavy taxes, State and Confederate, whilst the earnings of their labor are to be wrested from them at prices which will not remunerate.
