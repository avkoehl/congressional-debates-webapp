Following just received from Greencastle:

JULY 9, 1864.

Here is a statement of a block man; his name is George Ferry. He says he was servant in Forty-seventh Battalion of rebel cavalry, which is commanded by Major Harman, 300 strong. He heard rebel officers say their force is from 40,000 to 50,000, but his own opinion about 30,000 men. Says there is Wharton's division, Vaughn's division, McCausland's brigade of cavalry, Early's and Rodes' divisions. Says that Breckinridge is in command of all the forces; that the rebel forces are lying along the Potomac River from Sharpsburg, Boonsborough, Middletown, and on toward Frederick, Md. Says he heard Colonel Jackson and Captain Busher [?] say, in conversation together, that the rebel forces here were from 40,000 to 50,000. This is Colonel William L. Jackson, in command of a brigade of rebels. He says they stated that this movement was to draw Grant off from Richmond. He says he left the rebels on Friday, 8th instant, near Sharpsburg. Says he heard the rebel officers say force was at Dublin Depot, on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad.
