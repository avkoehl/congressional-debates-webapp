Brigadier-General TOWNSEND,Assistant Adjutant-General, War Department:

I do not exactly understand you dispatch. The order for General Crook to report to General Grant did come through me, and there will be no delay if General Crook has obeyed my order of yesterday. I have no understanding whatever with General Schurz or any one concerning General Paine, and have no use for him, as I know nothing about him; and as he is an officer of old date I might not be able to dispose of him.
