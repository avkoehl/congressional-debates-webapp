General FISK:

SIR: I sent a scout of men out under the command of Lieutenants Baker, McKown, and Elliott. I ordered them to cross the Missouri River and try and kill a band of guerrillas commanded by one Captain Hurleston. They killed Hurleston and two men by the name of Fiske and Wright, all noted guerrillas. We captured 4 horses and equipments and 4 pistols. It being out of my district I felt it my duty to cross and kill them. I will start after the remainder of the band this evening and wipe them out it possible.

I am, general, your most obedient servant,

Brigadier-General MITCHELL,

Fort Kearny:

Leaving Julesburg was a great mistake and caused a general howl. The stations and travel must be guarded. I suppose the Julesburg Station is again guarded. Answer.

Governor JOHN EVANS,

Washington:

Yours received. The troops under General Mitchell have returned to Overland line after scouring country on tributaries of Republican southwest of Julesburg. The Indians retreated north of Platte toward Powder River. Trains and stages are moving, and I think we will keep the line open. Need more troops to continue movements against Indians and strengthen Overland route. Will write you.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
