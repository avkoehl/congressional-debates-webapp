then relief? I trust not If anything be done,
open the door, and equalize benefits and burdens
to all classes and sections of the whole country.
Do something tor the relief and encouragement of
the commerce and navigation of the country,
which are alieady declining under your unequal
and oppressive laws and regulations. Look at
the fact that foreign tonnage is fast gaming upon
oui own, and that, without some modification of
your laws, the time is at hand when foreigners
will have more of our own trade than our own
citizens will enjoy. In 1826 the proportion of
foieign tonnage to American tonnage which en-
tered our ports was as one to eight, in lb37 it was
as seven to twelve, and in 1837 the entiances and
cleaiances m our ports were as follows.

With such facts before us, is it not our duty to
adopt measuies to restore American business to
Amencan bottoms? to encourage our navigation,
aid thereby inciease oui seamen' Then 1 pray
you do not repeal the bounty to fishing vessels,
and thus cut off your best nurseiy tor seamen,
but rather take off the duty upon copper, non,
duck, and cordage, or,if that cannot be done
without injury to other interests, allow a draw-
back of the duty upon these articles when used in
building ships and other vessels     In that way

compensation to the domestic manufacturers of'
the country, tne present system of credits ¡s to be
abolished, and this duty of twenty per cent  is to
be paid by the importer in ready money, and that, '
too, according to a valuation of the articles made
at the port of entry, and not at the foreign port
from which they have been exported     In addi-
tion to this, the act contains a long list of articles,
useful and necessary to our manufactures, which
are, after June, 1842, to be admitted free of duty
it is also ptovided that, after that date, "duties
' shall be laid for the purpose of raising such revenue
' as may be necessary to an economical admuns- ¡
' tration of the Government "                                    i
Under the operation of this act, the du'ies will
have gradually reached the final point of depres-
sion on the 30th June, 1842, and will then stand
at twenty per cent     Now, it does appear to me
to be a palpable violation both of the spirit and
letter of this law, to which I intend to adhere in i
good faith, to except the article of salt from its I
provisions     Salt is extensively manufactured in I
a portion of the State which I have in part the j
honor to represent.   The Senator from Missouri 1
states the foreign salt imported to be annually i
about six million thiee hundred thousand bushels, '
and he estimates the domestic production to be i
about the same quantity.    Although   I  do  not
speak fiom data on which I can rely, I believe the
building ships and other vessels in that way quantity 0f domestic salt is considerably greater
you will encourage Amencan industry and Amer- \flhan the fore,gn lmportatlon But be thls as ,t
lean enterprise, while the effect of passing the 1 may, it appears, fiom the Senator's own showing,
proposed bill will be to paralyze both.

REMARKS OF MR. BUCHANAN,
OF PENNSYLVANIA,
In Smite, Junumy 29, 1839,
On the motion of Mr Blnton for leave to mtro-
uuce a bill to repeal the duty on Salt and the
Fishing bounties.
Mr. BUCHANAN said that if the Senator
fiom Missouri had not himself made a special re-
quest that the usual courtesy might be waived
which required ¡senators not to oppose the intro-
duction and reference of any bill which a Senator
might present, he should not have said one word
on the present occasion There certainly was no
gentleman in the ¡senate to whom he should more
cheerfully have extended this courtesy than to the
Senatoi irom Missouu. 'Ihe Senatoi, however,
had called the yeas and nays, and desired to make
the mtioduction ot his bill a test question, and to
this he could have no objection He was willing
to consider it as such, and briefly to assign the
reasons why he should vote against granting him
leave to bring in the bill
I have ead (said Mr B ) with great pleasure
and instruction the remarks of the ¡senatoi, pub-
lished in the Globe of last evening, in favor of
repealing the duty on the importation of salt, and
the fishing bounties and allowances If this were
the session of 1841 or 1842, ms'ead of 1839, I
should feel disposed to give gieat we ght to his
argument On one point I consider it conclusive
1 think he has demonstrated that the bounty to
our fisheries originated exclusively in a drawback
of the duties on imported salt in their favoi, and
that this bounty ought to fall with the repeal of
these salt duties, unless it can be sustained on
some other principle
My objection to this bill is, therefore, chiefly
founded on the famous compromise act of March,
1833, to the leading provisions of which I desire
to call the attention of the Senate By us terms,
all duties on all imported articles, which had,
undei pievious laws, been subject to a duty ex-
ceeding twenty per cent on their value, weie to
be gradually reduced to this standard. One tenth
of the excess of duty above twenty per cent was
to  be deducted after the last day of December-
that the domestic manufactured article, protected
m some degree by the existing duty, exceeds bix
millions ot bushels per annum The domestic
manufacturers of salt, however much they may
have been dissatisfied with the eomptomise act,
had at least a light to expect that tins article
would not be made the solitary exception and be
admitted free of duty agairst its provisions They '
had a light to rely upon the protection which this
act affords, and the introduction of the present
bill to make salt a free article, will take them by
surprise Is not this attempt a manifest violation
of the compromise?
In the session of 1841-'42, at the latest, it will
become the duty of Congress seriously to consider  j
the subject of duties on imports generally, and ad- j i
just it in that spirit of compromise which gave birth   '
to the Constitution itself    I hope and believe that | [
southein gentlemen  will, at that period, whilst t
they have a right to insist that the revenue shall ||
be reduced to the standaid of an economical ad-
mmistiation of the Government, act in a liberal
spiut towards the manufactuies of the countiy
A duty granted merely and solely for protection,
we cannot ask under thecompromise, but we shall
expect that, whilst imposing duties for levenue,
such incidental discrimination  may be made in
favoi of our most i nportant and necessai y manu-
factures as will assist Amer can industiy in stiug-
gling against foreign competition     This principle
of incidental protection, within these limits, is as
old as the Government, and I have neve1- under-
stood that it was objected to by gentlemen of the
South.    If Í should  live until that day, and be
then a member of the Senate, I shall enter upon
i the task of adjusting  the tanff v.ith cveiy dis-
position not exclusively to regard the interest of i
any particular portion of the Union, but to act
| with libeiahty and dojustice to all the great inter-
ests involved.    I know that at that time many |
consideiations may be urged in favor of a repeal
i of all the duties on foieign salt     Such a measure
, would operate beneficia'ly upon the gieat agncu!   '
tural interest which I have ever regarded with pe-
culiar favor     But, at the present moment, this
duty rests upon the compromise act, and repre-
senting, a& I do, a considerable salt manufacturing
I interest, I am not disposed now to disturb ¡'    At
the time of the general revision of the tanff the
duty on this-article can be considered m connec-
_,   ____________,   ! tion with all the rest, and then a wiser and better
1833, a second tenth after the last day of Decern-    disposition may be made of it, than if we weie
ber, 1835, a third tenth after the last day of De-     now to act upon it alone, and without reference to
cembei, 1837   a fourth tenth after the last day of    its bearing upon the whole subject
Uecembei, 1839,  thiee of the remaining  ten'hs         Mr  IS   said that the qu°st or of courtesy being
after the las>t day of December, 1641    and  the    as it was out of view  he did no'understand how
other thiee remaining tentht, after the last day of I Senators, who had offeied able «ugurnet)ts against
this bill, could notwithstanding conclude by de-
claring that they would vote for its introduction.
Mr    BENTON  having  made some  remarks
which will be found on another pace'—
Mr BUCHANAN said, (in reply to Mr.
Bektov,) as to the compromise act I shall say but
little Its reputed authors are here present and are
very ab'e to defend themselves As to myself I
was in a far distant land at the time of its passage,
and shall never forget my own feelings when I first
leceived information of this event
The enemies of liberty in every country of the
Old World were tejoicmg m the prospect that this
glorious Union—the last hope of republican insti-
tutions—was about to expire. The advocates of
despotism were ev erywhere gloating over the pros-
pect It was impossible for any person placed in
my situation not to see, and to feel, and to know,
that this was the cherished hope of the enemies of
liberal institutions throughout Europe It was a
subject of conversation in every society which I
frequented in the great northern capital, where I
then resided. Although I did not myself person-
ally indulge in gloomy forebodings, yet 1 hailed
the news of the passage of the compromise act as
the harbinger of peace and tranquility at home,
with more joy than I have ever felt upon the an-
nouncement of any political event It was then
sufficient for me to know that the question which
had threatened the peace of my native land was
settled, and that, too, by the passage of a bill which
had received the approbation of Geneiai Jackson.
His sanction of it was, to me at least, the strong-
est evidence that it was not " a mere humbug " Í
felt the fullest confidence that his signature could
never have been affixed to any bill which would
sacrifice, or seriously injure, any of the great in-
terests of the country
Whether, under all the circumstances, I should
have voted for this bill or not, had I then been a
Senatoi, or whether it settled our difficulties wisely
or unwisely, is not now the question Be this as
it may, ithas stood the test of timedurmgaperiod
of six years, and it has not yet been changed by
Congress in a single paiticular The people of the
State which I, in part, represent, have, at least,
acquiesced in its provisions, and they are looking
forward to the year 1841 or 1842 for a general set-
tlement of the whole question
Now, sir, what ¡s my position' I am called upon
to except from this compromise a single article of
domestic manufacture, m which several counties of
Pennsylvania are deeply interested Would 1 not
be faithless to my trust, if 1 should agree that this
article, piotected as it now is by the existing tariff,
should be made the solitary except'on, ard that,
too, at a moment when the manufacturers of it are
reposing with pei feet security on the faith ofalaw
adhered to, as it has been by Congress, ever since
its passage it is not sufficient formeto know that
we possess the unquestionable power to violate it
Tne tiue question is, would it be wise, or politic,
or just, at the present advanced stage of Its prog-
ress   to disregard its provisions?
And, aftei all, what mithty matter is to be ef-
fected by this bill ? Under this very compromise,
the duty on salt has already been reduced to about
«iX cents per bushel After the last day of the
prese it year, it wnl «ink still lower, and after the
last day of June, 1842, it will be reduced to about
two cents oer bushel Within two, or at the
latest thiee, years after the close of the present
session, there must be a general revision of the
tariff, and I would ask, what interest, in themean
time, can suffer by paying the small duty of six,
and afterwards of four or two ren's per bushel on
the importation of foreign salt? Is this a cause
sufficient to justify the mighty efforts which have
been made to repeal the duty ? When I observed
these effoits of the Senator's great mind to accom-
plish an object so trifling and inconsiderable, they
forcibly reminded me of the simile of the English
poet. They resemble
j                          " Oct an into tempest tost,
1                 To v. ift a fea her, or to drown fifty "
Let us wait for two or three yea's, and then
settle tl is little matter in conjunction With tie
gieit questions which must ther a ise It is not an
olject \ 1 i< i co M e\c se, m cH lebs jU tify a
