FORT MONROE, VA., January 23, 1867.

Commanding OFFICER MIL. DIST. OF FORT MONROE,

Fort Monroe, Va.:

SIR: I report the general health of state prisoner Jefferson Davis to be much as on Wednesay last. He complains, however, of rheumatic pains in difficult parts of his person and neuralgic affection of the head. These I attribute to the fact of his having been compelled to remain in the house in consequence of the snow covering the ground, thereby depriving him of his accustomed exercise.

Your obedient servant,

GEO. E. COOPER,

Surgeon, U. S. Army.

This is, however, due in all probability to the necessary confinement to his quarters consequent upon the cold weather.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. E. COOPER,

Surgeon, U. S. Army.
