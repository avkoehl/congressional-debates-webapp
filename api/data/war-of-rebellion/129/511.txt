tion referred to that their transfers, though sent on more than two months before, had not been granted. At your suggestion I addressed a note to the Honorable Secretary on the subject, respectfully asking to be informed if the order referred to (No. 38) had been suspended as far as Charleston was concerned. I was prompted to this inquiry by the fact of General Lee's having requested me to suspend my efforts to withdraw Marylanders from his army to the Maryland camps till the present campaign was ended, which request I of course promptly complied with, fully acquiescing in its wisdom. This will, I presume, account for a fact to which you adverted in our brief interview - the limited number of men at General Elzey's camp.

It is fair to assume that had General Lee not have thought that Marylanders in his army were in sufficient force to constitute a power, he would scarcely have considered it a matter of consequence if they did or did not continue in the Virginia and other State organizations in which they were serving, and to which their members were credited as citizens of those States. Supposing that a corresponding exigency might exist making it a matter of importance to detain the Marylanders, entitled to transfer as stated, temporarily at Charleston, I had purposed, if my inference proved by the Secretary's reply to be correct, to appeal to the men who were complaining to me, asking them to continue their devotion to their flag in spite of their disappointment till the exigency had expired. My letter referred to was sent to the Department on the 16th instant, and when I tell you that it was under no less a prompting than the expressed wishes of General Lee, and with the cordial approval and indorsement of His Excellency the President, that I embarked in the effort to rally my countrymen, and that I have expended some thousands of dollars, private means, in the effort to accomplish that object, I think that you will admit that my request to be furnished with the information asked, for the use stated, was neither improper nor unreasonable; yet to this day my communication remains unnoticed. Self-respect would have impelled me to drop the matter here, for I don't choose to be considered as troublesome to any of your bureaus, but for another letter received from Charleston yesterday, making representations which, if true (and I see no reason to discredit them), are of so extraordinary a character, and so at variance with what I know to have been the purposes of His Excellency the President, that I am utterly at a loss to account for them.

When I visited Charleston in April last (which I did by request of the Maryland officers and other gentlemen of that State, and at the urgent entreaty of the men there who wrote to me to visit them) I had a frank and full conversation and understanding on the subject with General Beauregard, who acknowledged the justice of the President's purpose in authorizing the organization of the Marylanders into one body, and also conferred with General Ripley on the subject, both of whom bore testimony to the bravery and devotion of these men to the South, and General Ripley informed me, if I am right in my recollection, that a board of officers convened for the purpose had decided that these men were entitled to their discharge, they having served out their full term of enlistment and had sent their decision to the War Department. General Beauregard told me frankly that under the Order No. 38 he considered all the Marylanders in his department entitled to transfer to the Maryland Line, and an officer was selected of his command, and with his consent, to make that decision known to them, and with the knowledge and full consent of General Beauregard I visited the Marylanders who were under arrest
