will be sent forthwith. How are you off for arms and ammunition? Do you hear anything from the Chillicothe troops ordered this way?

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

CAMERON, July 21, 1864.

General FISK:

The Plattsburg troops have not been heard from. Captain McDonald is here in person. His men, about thirty in number, are on their way here. We want powder, lead, and buckshot, and say twenty stand of arms, and 1,000 rounds ball-cartridges, caliber .69. We have just heard that about 400 men from Chillicothe are in pursuit of this band.

GEO. SMITH.

SAINT JOSEPH, July 21, 1864.

GEORGE SMITH:

Captains Turney and Poe, from Plattsburg, will join you in an hour or two from Osborn.

FISK,

Brigadier-General.

HAMILTON, July 21, 1864.

General FISK:

We have driven the guerrillas out of Kingston. They robbed the town last night of some $6,000. We have 400 odd men after them, under Major S. P. Cox. They are now threatening Cameron.

S. MILLER,

Lieutenant.

CAMERON, July 21, 1864.

General FISK:

I am here with fifteen men. Plattsburg is taken. Please notify Jennison that they are aiming to cross the river at Liberty Landing or Blue Mills.

S. MILLER,

Lieutenant.

CHILLICOTHE, July 21, 1864.

General FISK:

Your telegraph order reached Trenton at 10 o'clock to-day. I immediately ordered five even companies of the Thirtieth Regiment Enrolled Missouri Militia, and requested all loyal men of the county to report here as soon as practicable. They will arrive 400 or 500 strong during to-morrow. They will come poorly armed; will await orders here. Pay no attention to my rank; I will work as best I can wherever I am placed.

J. H. SHANKLIN,

Colonel Thirtieth Regiment.
