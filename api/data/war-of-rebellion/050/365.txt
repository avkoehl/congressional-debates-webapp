WAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington, D. C., January 5, 1864.

Major General J. S. NEGLEY, U. S. Vols., Cincinnati, Ohio:

SIR: Your communication of December 27, 1863, stating that General Grant directed you to report to this office by letter for orders, has been received.

The General-in-Chief directs me to say in reply that he has no other orders for you, as you belong to General Thomas' command.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

LOUISVILLE, KY., February 24, 1864.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Cumberland:

SIR: I have the honor to inform the commanding general that the Court of Inquiry, convened to investigate my official conduct at the battle of Chickamauga, has concluded its labors.

From the highly favorable tone of the testimony, I am permitted to presume that my military reputation has been fully vindicated.

In view of the announcement by the Commander-in-Chief that I "belong to your command," I respectfully await orders, dependent, of course, upon the favorable conclusions of the Court of Inquiry and the order issued thereon by the President.

With considerations of personal esteem, yours, very truly,

JAS. S. NEGLEY,

Major-General.
