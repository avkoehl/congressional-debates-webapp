Will any one deny that the people of the
United States require less proportionate cur-
rency than do the people of England and
Prance? I understand that civilization tends
to the utilization of credit and to a reduction
in the pro rata of circulation. I realize that
population is not an exact basis for compari-
son ; yet I contend that our frontier popula-
tion, our freedmen, &c., offset the poorer
classes of England and France, while the lib-
erality and extravagance of the American
middle classes render a larger amount of1,
ready money necessary than of any other na-
tion. I therefore arrive at the positive con-
clusion that our circulation is not too large.
The great consideration is how to change the
character, not the amount, of our circulating
medium from an irredeemable paper basis to
a redeemable gold basis without inaugurating
that period of suffering and depression which
involves citizen and Government alike.
But circumstances exist demonstrating that
we must accept the present currency as at the
proper amount, and that we cannot contract
its volume without the most disastrous results.
The indebtedness of the General Government,
States, municipalities, corporations, and indi-
viduals is believed to be about seven thousand
million dollars. The total property of the
country is assessed at $121,000,000,000. Our
currency, including the bank reserve, is about
seven hundred millions. Here ive find that
we have about one third as much indebtedness
as wc have property, and less than three per
cent, of circulation to represent it all. The con-
traction of the currency will disturb the value
of property, but it will not lessen our debts.
A man to-day has $20,000 worth of property
and owes $10,000. The currency is arbitrarily
reduced, property depreciates, his debt be-
comes due, money is not obtainable, his prop-
erty is sold to pay it, and the whole is absorbed
to pay a debt of half the amount.
If all debts were equally distributed and were
owing among ourselves it would not work un-
mitigated evil to reduce the value of our prop-
erty by destroying the currency upon which it
rests. But this is always impossible. Now,
if we permanently retire 3100,000,000, one
seventh of our currency, we reduce the value
of our property $3,000,000,000; but the debts
are still $8,000,000,000. If we cut our currency
down one half, or $350,000,000, it reduces our
property to about ten thousand million dollars.
Still our debts are $8,000,000,000, or we might
safely say that our debts exceed our assets, and
neither the Government, States, corporations,
or individuals could collect or pay anything.
All would become bankrupt together. With
confidence gone it is just as hard for currency
to represent half the present values as it is to
sustain them where they are. There is abso-
lutely no limit to the decline in values which
panic and want of confidence will produce.
One hundred dollars would shrink to two dol-
lars. $1,000 to twenty, to reach the point where
currency would represent property dollar for
dollar. The total value of our property at
assessment prices is two to three per cent,
money and ninety-seven to ninety-eight per
cent, confidence.
The foregoing are the reasons why currency
cannot again be contracted. Values and in-
debtedness have accommodated themselves to
the existing amount, and the margin for con-
tingency capable of being retired has already
been withdrawn. The debtor side of the
account is now fixed and unchangeable except
As to the time when this nation can resume
specie payment no man can say. With short
crops in Europe and exceedingly favorable
circumstances at home, it may be within four
years. Under other circumstances not ex-
tremely adverse, it is more likely to be ten
years; under circumstances and legislation
such as at present exist, never. England strug-
gled for twenty-sixyears in her efforts to resume
specie payment, and passed on the average a
as we can pay off our indebtedness. Until we j| bill each "two years endeavoring "to effecMfce
can discover some way to do this we must find (j object.
some other method to remedy our mistakes
than by destroying our circulating medium.
What amount would you have destroyed ? One
hundred millions, two, or four? Why a part,
and not the whole ? Supposing the amount
we now use was gold instead of paper. Would
we feel that we had too much of it? Why.
sir, the slight contraction of loans by the
national banks four times a year, to make a
respectable showing in their quarterly returns,
stagnates business, creates great depression in
values, and doubles the rates of interest in all
the commercial centers.
The mere temporary locking up of only
twelve millions of currency in New York for
twenty days in November last sent a paralytic
chill throughout the length and breadth of the
land. It caused a decline of four per cent,
on Government bonds in two days ; it stopped
vessels from loading produce on the line of the
lakes, reduced the price of wheat twenty-five
cents a bushel, of cotton three cents per pound;
it failed forty-five firms in a single western
city, almost annihilated credit, raised the rate
of interest to one quarter and a half per
cent, a day, ninety to one hundred and eighty
per cent, per annum in the city of New York,
and would have broken several national banks
had not other institutions been able to help
them. This, Mi-. Speaker, is an example of
what a forced reduction of the currency will
produce. Yet this locking up was known to [
be but a stock jobbing affair, and was devoid
of fear or panic. It shows us how near the !
edge of a precipice we are treading, i
ifIhavenowshownthatbyreasonofalargely j
increased indebtedness, created for property i
at the high prices which an inflated currency '
produced, we can never return to th % per capita
of circulating medium which we required in
1800, or to that required in 1848, and that now
our circulation is not too large, I am safe in as-
suring the commercial community that a return
to specie payment will never again beattempted
by the Government by a contraction of the
currency ; notwithstanding the Secretary says,
" this is the only way in which it can be done,"
and notwithstanding the Comptroller of the
Currency says, " Congress can, whenever it
pleases, restore the credit of the nation by
directing the payment of $338,000,000, prom-
ises to pay;" meaning the retiring of the
$338,000,000 legal tenders.
I say that the Government will not, in the
light of past experience, again attempt any
such suicide, lietiring currency now means
pinching the merchants and destruction of
trade. Imports stopped, cessation of gold
revenue follows, and then, gentlemen, what be-
comes of the interest on the national debt ?
Do you mean to repudiate these pledges of the 1
nation's honor? If so, try this experiment: j
exhaust your 360,000,000 now in the Treasury
and you will converts present fear into a future j
certainty. You increased your indebtedness |
$3,000,000 a month for the past twelve months, i
or $35,625,102 for the year; your customs j
reveirae fell off $12,000,000 in gold, and your ;
internal revenue $75,000,000 in currency. Do '
not now show to the world your inability to !
provideinterest upon the bonds which you have j
been selling in Europe in place of wheat and j
cotton. I believe all this can be avoided in a j
simple, concise, and easy manner, although the |
honorable Secretary's apprehensions are ex- !
cited when he says:
After a generation of men had passed away
Parliament recognized the fact that the Gov-
ernment could not exist if it destroyed the
people; and it was on the fourteenth'legisla-
tive enactment, after intense financial suffer-
ing, depression of industry, and a general
impoverishment of the people, that we find
England in 1823 again paying gold, although
she had actually increased her paper circula-
tion from $53,050,000 in 1796, the year before
suspension, to $91,960,000 when she resumed,
showing the remarkable fact in contradiction
of all we now hear said, that she resumed pay-
ing specie on $38,310,000 more paper currency
than she had the year before she suspended;
an actual increase of seventy per cent, of cir-
culation, while her population increased but
fifty per cent., being a per capita increase of
twenty-five per cent, in circulation !
Obstinately the laws of nature will have their
own way. Whenever England undertook to
deprive the people of circulation the people
i couid not pay taxes, though England's con-
dition at that time was more favorable than is
ours now, for she owed her debt at home, and
the interest which she disbursed was allowed to
remain among her people.
We are certainly not making progress at pres-
ent. Asidefrom the mere funding of aportion
of our floating debt we are not in as good con-
dition as we were thirty months ago. Our
demand indebtedness is contracted to be paid
in gold some time, and yet the surplus gold
received by the Government is sold like so much
old iron and the proceeds taken to pay our cur-
rent expenses. Within the last four quarters
the Secretary sold $32,409,550, and in so do-
ing reduced the balance on hand $0,147,147.
Had no gold been sold we should have accumu-
lated $26,202,402 GO, a little nucleus around
which confidence would have commenced to
cluster.

A nation that owes largely nra=t have its own
people for creditors. If it does not the debt will be a
d<:;■ 'I wcightuijon its industry, and will be <iuUo likely
to force it into bankruptcy."
If the financial condition of the country was
in a usual normal state about three hundred
million dollars of gold would float this amount
of demand indebtedness. But while there is
a fraction of one per cent, difference between
the price of currency and gold, it will require
dollar for dollar to do it. It will not answer
to pay a portion of these obligations and then
fail oil the remainder. With gold exhausted
and this confession of weakness existing the
premium would again run up to a fearful point.
The country requires that prices should be
steady as well as moderate. The effort must
be fundamentally right, sustained by practical
principles calculated to give confidence to cap-
italists. It will not answer to depreciate the
price of gold to ten per cent, upon any falla-
cious basis, and then invite 3100,000,000 of
our European bonds back upon us at 90 in
gold which originally cost the holders 50. A
j mistake on our part will surely produce this
j result. We cannot, therefore, at this time name
> any day when we can commence to pay specie.
