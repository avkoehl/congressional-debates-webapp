Secretary of State.
Mr. MASON. Mr. President, according to
my recollection, there was a communication re-
ceived by the Senate at the last session, from the
Senafe of the State of Iowa, in reference to this
election. I ask that that paper be read.
Mr. JONES, of Iowa. The Senator from Vir-
ginia will recollect that that paper was read at the
Fast session when it was presented; but if he
desires to have it read again, I have no objection.
Mr. MASON. I desire to have it read now;
we have a new Senate.
The Secretary read the protest, as^follows:
State of T-owa, Senate Chamber,
Iow.v City, January 9,1855.
Sir: I am directed by the Senate of the Suite of fowa
to forward to you the inclosed preamble and iesoJutions,
with the request that you will lay the same before the Sen-
ate of the United States.
I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedieht
servant, MATURIN L. FISHER,

To the Hon. J. D. Bright,
President of the Senate of the United States.
State of Iowa:
Whereas it is reported that the journal of the House of
Representatives, as read this morning in the presence of
the House, alleges that a joint convention of the General
Assembly of this State was held in the hall of the House
on Saturday, tho Gtb instant; and whereas it is alleged in
said journal that said joint convention proceeded to elect
one Norman W. Isbcil as an associate judge of the supreme
court of this State, and one Jame3 Harlan as a Senator of
the United States, for the term of six years from the 4th
day of March next: Therefore—
Resolved, That inasmuch as the Senate has no knowl-
edge of any such joint convention, and did not participate
in the proceedings thereof, it hereby protests against the
action of said so-called joint convention, and declares the
same to be void and of no effect.
Resolved, That a copy of this preamble and resolution
be signed b> the President, and certified to by the Secretary
of the Senate; and presented to the Governor of this Suite;
also a copy forwarded to the Presiding Officer ofthe Senate
of the United States, with a request to lay the same before
that body.
MATURIN L. FISHER,
^ - President of the Senate.
Passed the Senate January 8, 1855.
AttestB. P. Ranki#, Secretary of the Senate'.
Mr. MASON. Mr. President, I was aware
tfiat a paper of this character had been communi-
cated to the last Senate, and I thought it right
that the present Senate, which is a new one,
should have the opportunity oft knowing the exact®
posture of this question. I was not in the Cham-
ber when the paper #as read, and was not aware
of its character, but I understand it is a certificate
by the Governor of that State, informing the Sen-
ate that the Senator whose credential it is was
elected by the General Assembly of Iowa. It is
in the usual form, and from the organ of that
State. I had formed no'definite opinion on the
subject; but I thought it right that this paper
from tne Senate of the State, a part of the con-
stituent body under the Constitution, should be
before the Senate of the United States. I- shall
make no motion upon it.
The oath of office was administered to Mr.
Harlan, and he took his seat in the Senate.
