[APRIL 22.]

Major [BELGER:]

Do you say that the Secretary of War directs the volunteers to be withdrawn from Ashland and the protection of the road?

[PORTER.]

(Received April 22, 1861-3.40 p. m.)

Major PORTER:

I will be in Harrisburg at 4 o'clock with the dispatches brought by Major Belger from the Secretary of War and Lieutenant-General Scott.

W. J. P[ALMER.]

Major PORTER:

DEAR SIR: If your should desire to see me while in the city you can find me at this telegraph office up to 9.45 to-night, or in the morning at Pennsylvania Railroad central office, 300 Willing's alley.

Very respectfully,

WM. J. PALMER.

YORK, April 22, 1861-3.20 p. m.

Major BELGER,

Ashland:

There are no regular troops to take the place of those removed. I am appealed to keep the volunteers where they are, and I consider the appeal most proper and just. If these volunteers are removed you will have an unguarded road, and by night a worthless one. I left it secure, the people protected, and by the security of the bridge capable of re-enforcement, and to-day would have re-enforced it strongly. I wish you to understand the position of affairs fully before you remove the volunteers and subject the road to an irreparable injury.

F. J. PORTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

ASHLAND, April 22, 1861.

Major PORTER:

Are the troops that are at Bridgeport volunteers or regulars?

BELGER.

ASHLAND, April 22, 1861.

Major PORTER,

Harrisburg:

If volunteers, they are not to be sent forward. Such is the instruction of the Secretary of War at this time.

JAS. BELGER,

Major.

ASHLAND, April 22, 1861.

Major PORTER:

Please inform me the number and description of regular troops you have.

BELGER.

Major.
