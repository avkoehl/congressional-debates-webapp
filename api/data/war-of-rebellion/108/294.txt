been previously reported to me. It is not probable that the first-named regiment will reach Wilmington for a week; the time of moveemnt of the latter was not stated. As to the number to be raised for local defenses I am not informed, but under the authority of your dispatch I will proceed to raise such as I can and in such numbers as in my judgment seem advisable. In glancing over the report you will, I think, be struck with the very limited number of men compared with the extent of the coast to be guarded, and I trust that the President will think proper to send me three of the North Carolina regiments until others can be raised. There is a pressing necessity for them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. GATLIN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
