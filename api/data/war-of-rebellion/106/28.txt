Captain H. B. MELLEN,

Second Cavalry California Vols., Commanding Fort Crook, Cal.:

SIR: The department commander has directed Captain David B. Akey's company of cavalry to proceed to Red Bluffs, on the Sacramento River, for the purpose of operating against a band of Indians which has recently made incursions into the northeastern part of Tehama County, in this State. It is not known to what tribe these Indians belong, except that they are not of the tribe residing at Big Meadows, in the northwestern part of Plumas County. The latter are represented as very friendly, and in the expedition hereinafter directed the general desires you to afford them the necessary protection, not only from hostile bands of Indians, but unauthorized organizations of white men. Captain Akey will be instructed to inform you of his arrival at Red Bluffs, on the receipt of which the general desires you to proceed in the direction of the recent disturbance and act as far as possible in concert with Captain Akey against the parties who committed the outrages in Tehama County. In the interval you will inform yourself regarding the country through which you will have to pass, and gain any other information that may be useful in executing the duties assigned you. You will leave at Fort Crook one commissioned officer and five men to guard the post.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICHD. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
