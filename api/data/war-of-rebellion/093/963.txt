it will then be necessary for you to hold the crossings of Duck River below Columbia. If he moves toward this place I will meet him here, and shall want you to watch for any movement on his part to turn my right.

Brigadier-General HATCH,

Commanding Cavalry Division, Lexington:

GENERAL: I have received your report of Hood's advance from Florence. If he intends to cross Shoal Creek, as his movement would indicate, I presume he had done so to-day, or at least commenced such preparations as to indicate his designs. I shall hope by to-morrow morning to have satisfactory information from you on this subject. Please get as accurate information as possible and advise me without delay. Capron was at Waynesborough on the 18th; found only a small force of the enemy. One of his scouts reported from Lawrenceburg to-day; had heard nothing of Forrest's advance. I ordered Capron to feel for the enemy from Mount Pleasant and to open communication with you, and he has wandered off to Waynesborough. I am trying to get him back.

Very respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH DIVISION CAVALRY,Bluewater, Four miles and a half Southwest of Lexington,

November 20, 1864-10 p.m.

General SCHOFIELD,

Pulaski:

Your dispatch directing me to move on the enemy's right flank received. I have concentrated General Croxton's command to-day at Lexington, and shall move to-morrow morning through Lexington toward Lawrenceburg. If I am led to believe the enemy are moving toward Pulaski, I shall move onto the Lawrenceburg and Pulaski road. The enemy's cavalry can now swing round my right flank and move his cavalry toward Pulaski without my knowing it, through Lawrenceburg, and may have done so. By moving northward I shall guard against this.

Very truly, your obedient servant,

EDWARD HATCH,

Brigadier-General.

FOR HATCH'S COMMAND, ON LAWRENCEBURG ROAD:
