into the valley of Stewart's Creek, which is a small stream where I cross it. My column threatens the enemy's communications, and I expect to be strongly resisted to-morrow. Will do everything mortal man can do to gain my position. It is 16 miles from here to Murfreesborough, and 2 1/2 miles for the road tolerably bad, but can make it. I do not like to leave Triune. I would rather put it at Lane's store. My wagons from Nashville, with additional rations, I have ordered to La Vergne, from whence they can be forwarded me. They would not be safe from the enemy's cavalry at any other point of road. The cavalry of the center has not a round of ammunition, and General Stanley reports that there is none in Nashville for these arms.

Respectfully,

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General, Commanding.

GENERAL: Rousseau's division is ordered to be in position this night at Stewart's Creek. McCook directed to close in on Murfreesborough with all his available force. You are aware that out prospect of bringing the enemy to battle near Murfreesborough is becoming more and more bright. Please send Rousseau's supply train up the Murfreesborough pike to Stewart's Creek, instead of to Nolensville. McCook can go up the Nolensville pike. The hospital and ambulance train can come up to-morrow.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
