You will prepare your command to march as soon as possible, i. e., mount all your men, equip and supply them with ordnance and quartermaster's stores, three days' rations two extra horseshoes per horse, you hoses being well shod all round. After you have supplied yourself with everything your wagon train will be held ready to move to Harper's Ferry. The regiment at Default's will not move for the present. Let me hear from you at once, and report your state of preparation. Make preparations as though to leave camp permanently. Londoun Valley must be cleaned out.

HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION CAVALRY,February 21, 1865.

Colonel PENNINGTON,

Commanding First Brigade:

Genera; Crook, General Kelley, and other officers were captured last night by about sixty men belonging to McNeill's command. The force were berrying toward Romney. The chief of cavalry directs that a force be sent immediately from this division to intercept them, if possible. Have 300 of your best mounted men get ready at once, with two days;' rations and one of forage. I would suggest that the men be selected from the different regiments. Do not detail an officer of higher rank than major to accompany the expedition, as Lieutenant-Colonel Whitaker will go in command. Have the men rendezvous at your headquarters.

Very respectfully, &c.,

G. A. CUSTER,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

CUMBERLAND, February 21, 1865.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

Generals Crook and Kelley were taken from their beds early this morning by the rebels. Our cavalry is after them.
