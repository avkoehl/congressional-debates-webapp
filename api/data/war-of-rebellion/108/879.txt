HEADQUARTERS NORTHWESTERN VALLEY BRIGADE,Upshur County, Va., April 28, 1864. (Via Staunton May 1.)

General R. E. LEE:

Over an almost impassable road I penetrated the county midway between Philippi and buckhannon day before yesterday. General Mulligan's brigade was at Philippi, General Roberts' brigade at Buckhannon. Both have fled, burning their stores. W. E. Jones has not communicated with me. I have reliable information of his entire success in destroying the railroad as far as Rowlesburg. I could not advance on Grafton till Roberts was dislodged from Buckhanonand my rear made safe. That is now done, and I press forward to-day. I hhpe Grafton and Clarksburg will be in my possession within three days. My horses are dreadfully used up by bad roads, hard work, and scant forage. My command is in the highest spirits.

The following just received from General Pickett:

The fleet off Newport News has left, leaving the usual blockaders. They did not seem to be landing or taking off troops. The heavy wind last night was the probable cause of the fleet reported this morning.
