SEPTEMBER 5, 1863.

General COOPER,

Adjutant-General, Richmond:

This correspondence is from General Rosecrans' headquarters. The exact move of Crittenden has been made, up to crossing the river. Burnside's programme has also been correctly laid down, but he finds Buckner confronting Crittenden instead of being cut off.

Thomas and McCook have crossed at the point nearest Rome. The movements of Buckner have frustrated one part of the plan.

We shall strive now to turn it to our advantage.

BRAXTON BRAGG.
