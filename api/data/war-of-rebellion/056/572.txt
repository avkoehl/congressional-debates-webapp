HEADQARTERS MARTIN'S DIVISION,

October 20, 1863-6.30 p. m.

Major E. S. BURFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: General Wheeler's order directing me-

To turn over to General Roddey the companies he may designate for the purpose of driving out cattle from the north bank of the river for the use of the corps.

has just been received. I would respectfully protest against the liberty given to another officer to make details from my command ad libitum, leaving me no discretion in the matter. I cannot but look upon it as an imputation upon my judgment and capacity to make such details when needed. I have not the slightest objection to my men serving under General Roddey, but believe I am justified in objecting to an order so unusual in its character.

I am, major, respectfully, yours,

WILL T. MARTIN,

HEADQUARTERS,Meridian, Miss., October 20, 1863.

Brigadier-General CHALMERS,

Commanding,&amp;c., Grenada, Miss.:

GENERAL: A telegram was sent you of this date, directing that all negro men, able-bodied, within your field of operations be sent immediately to this point for Government work. This labor is greatly needed. The principal reason for the order is to be found in the fact that every negro fit to be made a soldier of is put by the enemy in his ranks. It is important and necessary to check this in every possible way. The old men, women, and children will be allowed remain.

By command of General Johnston:
