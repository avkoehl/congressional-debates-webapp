Major-General SHERMAN,

Ringgold, Ga.:

Major General E. R. S. Canby, U. S. Volunteers, has been placed in command of the Military DIVISION of WEST Mississippi, composed of the Departments of Arkansas and of the Gulf, and has left to join his command. He will stop at Louisville to consult with General Allen in regard to supplies. Please send the latest information you have to General Canby at Cairo. * General Canby has authority to use any of your troops on the MISSISSIPPI River in case of an emergency, but not to interfere with your plans for the security of the navigation of that river. This arrangement relieves you from all further responsibility in regard to operations WEST of the Mississippi. General Grant's last orders were that A. J. Smith and his command were to remain WEST of the MISSISSIPPI River until further orders.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
