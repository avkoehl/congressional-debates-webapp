SPRINGFIELD, ILL., August 1, 1862-7.15 p. m. (Received 9.10 p. m.)

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

By direction of his Excellency Governor Yates I have the honor to request that authority be given to him to resort to drafting whenever it may appear to him necessary or expedient.

ALLEN C. FULLER,

Adjutant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., August 1, 1862-9.35 p. m.

General N. B. BAKER,

Clinton, Iowa:

I am authorized by the Secretary of War to say that he never authorized the raising of the Eighteenth Regiment for Annapolis; that was only spoken of at the time as the probable place of rendezvous. Things have changed since then, and the regiment is wanted elsewhere. It was raised to fight the rebels. They are not at Annapolis. It is wanted at Chattanooga, and if armed and equipped will proceed to Nashville, Tenn., and report to General buell.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Commanding.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., Augusta 1, 1862.

His Excellency Governor BRADFORD,

Annapolis, Md.:

The President directs that you proceed with all convenient diligence to cause the militia of the State of Maryland to be enrolled, and make return thereof to this Department.

Yours, truly,

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, August 1, 1862.

General C. P. BUCKINGHAM:

Recruiting for the new regiments is progressing finely, but for the want of recruiting officers can do but little for the old regiments. The colonels of the several regiments should either send some recruiting (non-commissioned) officers, with the assurance that I would commission them on their raising the usual number of men, or request me to appoint men at home. Allow me to call your attention to my dispatch of May 23 upon this subject.

DAVID TOD,

Governor.
