Brig. General JOHN A. RAWLINS:

I have this moment learned that Loring is up at Okolona with his division. The cavalry from below are uniting with Chalmers and Richardson. They aim for our railroad, and to prevent re-enforcements. We are ready, but if attacked will lose some small posts. There are not less than 15,000, all told and of all arms, threatening the road.

Loring, with his division, is at or near Okolona, bound to try Corinth. Inform Osterhaus and keep strong patrols. Jackson's cavalry are moving up, and with Chalmers' force will make about 6,000 men, threatening La Grange and other points on the road. Altogether they will show from 15,000 to 20,000 men. See that everything is in complete order for an attack at any time. Shut off all communication with the posts on the line.
