Anderson &amp; Co., and was in their possession, I determined to move early this morning with my entire force and give them battle, but on my arrival here I was happily disappointed in the result of the engagement of yesterday, and from what little information I have been able to gather up our troops acted bravely and well, losing 1 man killed and 2 wounded. There are five dead rebels on the ground besides others said to be carried off, and quite a large number wounded. I will remain here until I hear from you, unless I can learn of some movement of the rebels which it is important to meet at once. I would be happy to receive orders from you by return messenger. My command are anxious to meet the enemy and get revenge for the wanton massacre of the Third Missouri State Militia. Colonel Matthews should not be censured for the disaster, as he had taken, as he thought, all necessary precautions to insure its safe arrival, and on my arrival at Rocheport, and learning from Colonel Matthews that his baggage train would be in that day, I ordered him to send out thirty cavalry to meet them, and they had just met them when the fight took place. The rebels burned all the train except the commissary and ammunition wagons, which, strange to say, were not destroyed, and we now have them in our possession. we lost 12 men killed, the bodies of whom have been found, and 3 negroes (teamsters). All the soldiers were shot in the head, showing that they had been murdered after being captured. Captain Roberts and Captain McFaden are yet out, and fears are entertained that they have been killed. I would like to have the fifty men of First Iowa Cavalry to join me before leaving this part of the county.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. B. DOUGLASS,

Brigadier-General.

P. S. - I have the pocketbook of Colonel Perkins, found on the battle-ground of the disaster to Third Missouri State Militia, and I am inclined to think he was mortally wounded.

GENERAL: In answer to yours of the 8th instant requesting a report from me of the number of casualties in the Enrolled Missouri Militia under my command during the raid of Price in Missouri, I have the honor to report that I have received no official report showing that any of my command were killed during said raid. I had some 4 or 5 wounded in different skirmishers during the time Captain Fowkes, captain Company C, Seventieth Enrolled Missouri Militia, surrendered Paris on the 15th of October. At the time of the surrender, he reports Lieutenant Vance, with 69 belonging to the Forty-sixth Enrolled Missouri Militia, I have been informed, surrendered at Glasgow, but of this I have received no official report.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
