ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL, DEPT. OF THE CUMBERLAND:

Colonel Wheeler said, in the presence of J. W. Jacobs, Jefferson County, Thirteenth District, on May 11, that if the Yankees did not quit running him round so much, that he would be damned if he did not go to bushwhacking; and that they intended to do that anyhow as son as they got [sic]; that they were only paroled, and not whipped, and that Governor Brownlow should not live three weeks after [he] arrived at home. this was addressed to Scott, who said it was all right, and they would attend to Governor Brownlow as soon as they got home. Scott is a heavy-set man, about twenty or twenty-five years old, light hair, and red complexion.

CAMP NEAR ROGERSVILLE, May 16, 1865.

Major G. M. BASCOM,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I am still patrolling the country especially north of clinch Mountain, and find the same readiness to submit to the Government everywhere. Citizens are everywhere in Tennessee and Virginia taking the steps necessary to the re-establishment of order. There yet a few robbers and horse-thieves to be looked after, and the people all over the country, without regard to antecedents, aid us readily. We are doing well.
