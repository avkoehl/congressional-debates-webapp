WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, December 15, 1864-12 midnight.

(Sent 12.05 a. m. 16th.)

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville:

I rejoice in tendering to you and the gallant officers and soldiers of your command the thanks of this Department for the brilliant achievements of this day, and hope that it is the harbinger of a decisive victory, that will crown you and your army with honor and do much toward closing the war. We shall give you a hundred guns in the morning.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WASHINGTON, D. C., December 15, 1864-11.30 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville, Tenn.:

I was just on my way to Nashville, but receiving a dispatch from Van Duzer, detailing your splendid success of to-day, I shall go no farther. Push the enemy now, and give him no rest until he is entirely destroyed. Your army will cheerfully suffer many privations to break up Hood's army and render it useless for future operations. Do not stop for trains or supplies, but take them from the country, as the enemy have done. Much is now expected.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., December 15, 1864-11.45 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville, Tenn.:

Your dispatch of this evening just received.* I congratulate you and the army under you command for to-day's operations, and feel a conviction that to-morrow will add more fruits to your victory.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON CITY, December 15, 1864-11.50 p. m.

Brigadier General J. A. RAWLINS,

City Point, Va.:

I send you dispatch just received from Nashville.* I shall not now go there. Will remain absent, however, until about Monday.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

NASHVILLE, December 15, 1864.

Mrs. F. L. THOMAS,

New York Hotel, New York:

We have whipped the enemy, taken many prisoners and considerable artillery.
