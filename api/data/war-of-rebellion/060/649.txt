(Received 3. 50 p. m. 7th.)

SECRETARY OF WAR:

General Meigs arrived here to-night. The raid on Cherrystone and the capture of the Titan seem to have no object except that of theft. The Titan has been chased into the Piankatank River, where she is watched by four navy gun-boats.

Major THOMAS T. ECKERT,

Assistant Superintendent Military Telegraph:

I send this information without authority. For some days the enemy have been massing forces about Suffolk-artillery, infantry, and cavalry. Last night, as I understand they made an attack and came near getting into Portsmouth and Norfolk. I do not get this from official sources, but think it true.

Major-General BUTLER,

Fort Monroe:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 3rd instant, inclosing two from General Peck, dated February 29, is received.

There are no troops which can at present be sent to operate in North Carolina without taking them from the Army of the Potomac. I am unable now to inform you whether or not it is contemplated to send large forces into your department for the spring campaign. Lieutenant-General Grant is expected here by the 10th, when your letter will be submitted for the decision of the Government.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK

General-in-Chief.
