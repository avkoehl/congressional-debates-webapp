Push on to Paola as soon and as fast as possible. The balance of your Regiment will be forwarded as soon as they arrive at Saint Louis. With the number of men you have you should be able to bridge the streams between Warrensburg and Paola that cannot be forded.

Colonel HYNES:

The force I sent to Indian Ford has returned. They could not find Hildebrand or hear anything of him. Everything is quiet in this vicinity. I think a great many guerrillas have left this part of the country.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI, Springfield, Mo., April 7, 1865-3. 30 p. m.

Major J. W. BARNES,Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the Missouri:

Eight more deserters from Shelby's division came in last night. They left Fulton early last month and appear to be earnest and reliable men. They say that the rebel army is in a most demoralized condition and that several whole companies, officers and men, have deserted and gone to Mexico, and that those sent after them also deserted. The men composing Anderson's old band were at Sherman, Tex., and stated to one of these men that most of them were in favor of going to Mexico instead of coming back to Missouri, and thought they should not come back this summer.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
