nection with the bill just referred is from the
representatives of seven yearly meetings of tho
religious society of Friends in fifteen Statesâ€”
Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, ^Ver-
mont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York,
! Michigan, Maryland, Viiginia, Ohio, Indiana,
| Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas. This document
1 piescnts in a clear atid brief manner the con-
dition of Indian affairs in this country, and
will, I think, be interesting to all tho members
of the House. 1 desire, therefore, that the
111011101 ial be ordered to be printed in the Globe.
There being no objection, it was so ordered.
The memorial is as follows :
To the SauUetnd House of 10-prcscntativc^ in Congress
assembled:
Tho memorial of tho undersigned, representatives
of seven yearly meetings of tho religious society of
1 Friends ill tho States of Maino, Now Hampshire,
I Massachusetts Vermont, llhodo Island, Connecticut,
' New i'nik, Michigan, Maryland, Virginia, Ohio,
! Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas,respectfully rep-
"I'iiat we have mot in the city of Baltimore unitedly
, to consider our Christian duly in reference to tho
i pro-cut condition of tbo Indians of our country.
While thus engaged, having before us tho report
of tho joint special committee of Congress upon tho
"eomh.ion of tho Indian uibes," punted January
! 21), ISiVT, and that of tho "Indian peace commission,
Januaiy 11, ISM," and subsequent reports of tho
civil and military proceedings in lefeionce to tho
Indians, wo havo realized tho deep iesponsibility
which rests upon all member:, of a community pro-
fessing to bo Uhiistiaus in their dealings and inter-
course with tho feeble remnants ol tho aboriginal
inhabitants of this land. _
In contemplating tho disgraceful fact? rovealed m
those reports and tho udinr.sioii of our own witnesses
that our wars with tlielndi ms, which iiave beeo_ al-
most constant, havebeen uniformly caused by injus-
tice on the partof our white citizens andot Govern-
ment officials.' wo aro reminded of tho fact that tho
t lenty nl the Indians with W ii liani l'oim was faithfully
kept during tho seventy years in winch flic govern-
ment ot Pennsylvania was ydministoied upon tho
principles of its founder; and history tells us that
"whiletho surroundingcolomesnero ever and anon
at war with tho Indians, and tho sealping-knifo and
tomahawk brought death and terror to many a
hearth, the Pennsylvania!!* and nil their possessions
remained uninjured." "The Indians remembered
the treaty with tho sons of Onus (Perm) and kept it
inviolate."
Is there any reason to suppose that tho Indians of
tho picsent day are, less dispo-ed to be faithful to
their engagements than were their ancestors? Tho
testimony of Colonel Bent, contiimed by other wit-
nesses, before tho joint committee above referred to,
states, a fter thirty-six years' expei icnco in the vicinity
of the Indians against whom tho United States Army
is now engaged in hostile operations, that nearly
every instauoo of difficulties between tho Indians
and the whites during his re-idonco there were from
aggressions on tho Indians by the whites. And after
giving an intercstingdetaif of the causes v/nich have
directly or indirectly led to the present deplorable
stato of affairs, this experienced witness closed his
testimony with these remarkable words: "If the
matter wero lett to me I would guaranty with my
lifo that in three months I couid havo ail the Indians
along the Arkansas at peace without tho expenso of
war." .
I3ut we do not desito to dwell upon the sickening
history of the past except to guard against itsrepeti-
tion in tho future. While the white men whose
brutal murders have brought upon many mnoeent
settlors tbe vengeance of an outraged savage foestltl
go unpunished, and with blood upon their hands
demand the extermination of the Indians, many of
the tribes, both innocent and guilty of retaliation,
have beon destroyed by the sword, and their sur-
vivors have been reduced to subjection and have
submitted themselves to tho sense of justico m tno
white man's breast.
But it is said that our wars with them havo been
almost constant, llavo we been uniformly unjust i
V/e answer unhesitatingly, yes." See iface Com-
