Major T. T. ECKERT:

Telegraph has been down all day between Columbia and Franklin, so no news from the army. When last heard from General Schofield was at Columbia, having skirmished with the enemy's infantry as he fell back from Pulaski. Forrest was reported at Centerville trying to cross Duck River; Brigadier-General Ruger watching him with two brigades to prevent it. General Granger has withdrawn from Decatur and Huntsville to Stevenson and Bridgeport. General A. J. Smith's forces were passing Fort Donelson at 12 m. to-day. River falling.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Columbia:

Your cipher dispatch of 8.30 p.m [24th] is just received; some difficulty in transmission the cause. Your arrangements are judicious, and approved. I gave orders two days ago to make the concentration you suggest, and hope it will be nearly or quite completed to-day. Will telegraph you further this morning.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

Was your telegram reporting you had heard from Hatch sent before or after the cipher?

NASHVILLE, November 25, 1864-11.20 a.m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Columbia:

In case you have to move to the north bank of Duck River, I wish you to keep some cavalry on the south side to observe and delay Hood's advance on the Chattanooga railroad as much as possible. I hope to have five regiments of Granger's troops in Murfreesborough to-day. Have made arrangements for Milroy to fall back to Murfreesborough or this side of Duck River also, if the enemy advances. The cavalry on the south side of Duck River should cover the approaches to Shelbyville and cross at that place, and hold the bridge in case of an advance in force. I have asked Steedman how large a force he can raise to threaten the enemy's rear, should he get on the Chattanooga road, and expect an answer soon. About 1,000 of Hatch's cavalry has arrived here from Memphis, dismounted, but they will be mounted here as soon as possible and sent to the front; three regiments should start to-day, making about 1,000 men. I have not heard from any of Smith's troops yet; some of them will surely be here to-day. If Hood moves on the Chattanooga road I will send Smith to Murfreesborough, as we shall be enabled thereby to concentrate more rapidly. If you can hold Hood on the south side of Duck River, I think we shall able to drive him back easily after concentrating. Answer, giving your views.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
