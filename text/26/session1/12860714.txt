Independent Treasury—Mr Allen,
H. o! Reps.
that they may see the dinger* of the pah they propose to
tread, if anv there be, and perhaps be induced tin retij to avoi 1
ii altogether
Bva report of Mr Secretary Woodbury maie to the House
of Representatives December 12, 1*34, it seem1! that, under the
Centederation what little monev t oneress had Was deposited
wherever the finance committee direc'ed, depending up n sc
cidental circumstances    When the Rink of North  America
the first in the country, was established bv a few wealthy cm
tens of Philadelphia at a time when the public credit was at i s
lowest ebb, and throush the instrumentality  of which  tunds
were provided to enable Congress to pro-eeote the war at the
South with visor gloriously terminattne it by the capture ot
Comwalhsat^orktown, the public mmey was deposited in it
Subsequently, as the three banks of Massachusetts New York,
and Maryland were successively established  they were made
depositories    Iu 1791 the first Bank ol the United States was
chartered, and in that were the deposites made by order of Gen
Hamilton, Secretary of the Treasury    We have heard much
lately, Mr  Chairman, in this debate, of Hamiltomau Federal
mis, and this Gen Hamilton, I understand, was the founder of
the sect, and his name is to live in that connection so Ions; as
then are demagogues to prate about Federalism and Monarchy
as synonymous terms, and that must be, I suppose, as long as
the Government stands
Well, sir, it seems by a lata discovery in the other wing of
this Capitol, that the world has been entirely in error for half a
century in the estimate it has placed upon the mental capacity
of this Gen Hamilton, for it has been foolishly believed that
he wa  a man of transcendent abilities, especially m matters of
finance; at any rate, we know, sir, that he created our Treasury
system out of chaos, and gave it form and «omelinesa, and
breathed into it the breath of life, and stamped the impiess of
his own genius, whatever it may have been, upon every feature
«o effectually that it has never been effaced, and hence, sir, in
the apparent success and brilliancy of his career, it is not siugu
lar that men's minds lost that balance so essential to preserve
morder to arrive at just conclusions    But now, Mr  Chair
man, late as it is, the verdict and judgment of the world, untm
aiously rendered and sanctioned by the lapse of fitly years, is
tobe '-set aside, reversed, and altogether held fornausht," by
virtue of a discovery of an henoiable Senator whose constitu
-ency and mine are in part the same, that Gen Hamilton was at
best but a third rate man, thus most conclusively showing that
wear* growing wiser and wiser as each day's sun rolls over us,
and that Mr Jefferson was notso much mistaken as has some
time* been pretended, when he said that "error of opinion may
be safely tolerated whan reason is left free to combat it "
But, sir, pardon this digression, and I will return to my his
toncal reminiscences.
In 1909 was the first legislation on the subject of the deposites
of the public money—Congress then requiring the disbursing
officers of the Government "to keep" the money under their
control in some neigboring bank whenever practicable In
181! the charter of the Bank of the United States expired, and
Mr Gallatin, then Secretary of the Treasury, selected State
bank  «a depositoi leg; and so the law and usage remained till
1816, when the late bank was chartered, and made, by the terras
of it  charter, the depository of the public funds, though State
banks, m some portions of the country remote from the
branches ot the United States Bank continued to be used Ofthe
banks so selected between 181! and 1816, but continuing depo
poaitone  for some years thereafter, none failed till 1817, when
there were seven, owing collectively 8139000, of which they
«km paid all bat (6,000 During that moat embarrassms pe
rwd in our financial and commercial relations, from 1817 to
1331, four mora failed, three of which paid in full, and the
amount due by the other was small
The following extracts I read from the report refrered to,
which indicates great research and labor by Mr Woodbary
Extract from Woodbury'  Report, December 12,1834
" Justice to the State banking institutions, as a body, whose
conduct m particular cases has certainly been objectionable, but
whose injuries to the Government have been almost incredibly
exaggerated, and  hc*e great benefits to it, both during the ex
ieteoce of our two national hanks, and while neither of them
existed, have been almost entirely overlooked, ha* led me to
make this scrutiny, and submit its results, under * hope that it
will, in some degree, not only vindicate them from much un
merited censure, but justify this Department for the confidence
it formerly, and in the great Improvement of their condition and
of the financial affairs of the Government, has recently re-
posed in them
"Under these circumstances, so very favorable with the new
«•rarity and examinations provided for, if our former small
losses by them, in keeping and paying over the public revenue,
under circumstances so very adverse, are compared with our
large losses, either in collecting or disbursing that revenue,
their present safety seems to be as great as la consistent with
the usual opeiations of the paper system, or with the credit
which must always be entrusted by Government in some way
or other, to agents of some kind, in keeping the public money "
Extract from Mr. Woodbury's Special Report, December
12,1834
HIt is gratifying to reflect, however, that the credit given by
the Government, whether to bank paper or bank agents, has
been accompanied by SMALLER losses, in the experience un
der the system of State banks, in this country, at their worst
periods and under their severest calamities, than any other kind
of credit the Government has ever given in relation to its pec u
nwry transactions" * * • • "Thus the truth on this
much misunderstood and misrepresented subject appears to be,
not only that one failure of a selected bank did not occur within
the period while no United States Bank was in operation, but
that ofthoae which afterwards stopped payment with'n three
or four year ) chiefly from the causes before mentioned, and a
part of which causes produced eight or tenfold as many failures
in England, under the full control and influence of a national
bank mere a* wel' as here, four of the number have since dis-
charged all their liabilities, and the residue of the liabilities of
all the other  as deposite banks, in the manner before estimated,
{«leas than «35,000 This m not the tithe of the «urn which has
freouMiily been lost to the Treasury by the failure of individu
al merchant  to discharge only their obligation  for import ,
not equal to the sum frequently lost by the fail u re of many single
disbursing agent  connected with the different departments of
the {Government, and under larger bonds for security
Whether they (losses by Sute banks] arose from an unsound
policy pursued by the United States Bank, or from circum-
stance* which, under the paper system, neither legislation nor
caution can always avert, or from lea* justifiable reasons, and
in spite of all tliestlutnry influence the Nitional Bink could
exeicise, ltisasmgu ar fact, in praise ol this description of pub
Uc il btora—the selected banks—that there is not now due on
■le( o-i ein the wh leol them which hive evei stopped payment
irom the establishment ot the Constitution to the present mo
ment, a sum much btvind what is now due to the I mted "tates
from one mercantile hrm that stopped pav ment in 1325 oi 13)36,
and of whom ample security was required, and eiif posed to be
taken under the responsibility of an oath If we include the
whole present dues troin the Government tiom discredited banks
stall times, and ot all kinds, whether as deposites or i ot, and
embrace even counterftit bills, ami every other species of
unavailable funds m the lreasury,they will not exceed what is
due from two such firms Of almosi one hundred banks, not
di positories, which, during all our wars and commercial em
barrassmeiits, have heretolore failed, in any part of the Union, in
debt to the Government, on their hills or otherwise, it will be
seen by the above table [annexed to the repirt) that the
whole of them, except seventeen, have adjusted every thing
which they owned; ana that the balance due from them, without
interest, is less than •82,000 "
There is some obscurity about the results, as exhibited by
•hese extracts, but a reference to the tables appended to the re
port will show losses of all kinds to have been •1,157 000
In December last, Mr Woodbury stated that ol that amount
about $300 OW had been collected since his former report,
leaving about 8900000 actually due from the State banks
with which the Government had had any business transac
tions whatever, whether by using thorn as depositories or by
the receipt of their notes, and 'embracing even counterfeit
bills "
True it is, that in December, 1838 and 1839, Mr Woodbury
asserts the losses to have been six and a half millions, adding
to his former calculation five and a half millions for loss sus
tamed by the receipt of the depreciated notes ofthe banks dur
mg the war I ask, sir, if it is not strange that an item so ím
portant as this, being five times as great as all the losses re
ported in 1834, should have been so overlooked by Mr W in
makin  a special report of nearly fifty closely printed pages, in
wh ch he undertakes to "give information to the Legislature
respecting all matters which shall pertain to his office" in rela
Hon to the advantaees ofthe State bank deposite system, as con
trasted with anvand every other
Thismostimportant item, to which he before made noallu
sion, he lei s us does not appear on the Treasury books, or any
where else, and therefore he jumps to his conclusion, and which
misht, upon his own showing have been any thing or nothing,
much or little, assuited the occasion Hence in 1834, this
newlv vamped up loss had no existence, in December, 183?,
and 1839 tt was five and a half millions, and when wa come back
here next December we may find it down to cipher or up
to fifteen millions, varying, as ihe interests of the party may
require, vastly more than the length of the English Chancellor s
<bot
If a loss had actually occurred that was in any way tangible,
I ask if it must not necessarily have been shown on the books
of the Department; for how otherwise could its accounts be be-
lancedl I understand the pretence for setting up tine claim is
based upon the fact that the Treasury notes during the war
were sold for bank bills which were at a discount for specie,
the banks south of New England having suspended, and the dif
ference between specie and the bank bills la charged as the loss
But, Mr Chairman, what was the relative value of the Treasu
ry notes and bank notes during the war? The last were from
five to ten per cent discount for specie, and the former at from
ten to twenty-eight percent thus making the difference between
Treasury credit and bank credit greater than between bank credit
and specie, the people believing the notes of the banks would
be paid with greater certainty and less delay than those of the
Government And what time the credit of the Govornment
was at its lowest ebb, I do not know, nor is it material, but my
impression is that it was soon after that moEt dtstressirg and
affhc'ing period ofthe war, in August, 1814, when our coasts
were lined with British ships filled with the victors df Napole
on, annihilating our commerce, destroving our towns, and dis
gracing themselves and us, by reducing this magnificent edifice
and the other public buildings here, used for civil purposes
merely, to ruins Then it was our Government appealed to
the banks to furnish the means, as they had already partially
done, toenable the Government to protect the country; and
their "patriotic efforts," as Mr Woodbury styles them, were
pu' forth to their great loss ard embairassment, as most clear
ly evinced on the attempt subsequently to resume specie pay
ments During the war specie was an article of merchandise
exclusively, all the business of the country had reference to
and was transacted upon the paper currency, and the paper re
ceived by the Government, excepting to a limited extent, was
paid away at its nominal rate
I reject, therefore sir, this claim of five and a half millions,
not thought of in 1834, and now first presented by a Secretary
of the Treasury, only because it might help to bolster up this
new project, thrice rejected by the representatives ofthe people,
and I hold Mr Woodbury to the account as stated in 1834, mak
inga balance then of about 81,100000 from which is tobe de
ducted about 8300,000, paid between 1834 and 1837, showingan
actual loss to the Government, from its foundation down, of
8900,000 in round numbers
The loss by collecting and disbursing officers between 1789
and 1837, T have before shown, was S7 000,000, making a diffe
rence of 86 000 000 against the limited Sub Treasury plan, as it
had been in practice when one class of officers were presumed
to deposite the money in bank as soon as collected, and the other
was presumed not to receive it till wanted for disbursement In
near fiftv years the Government lost by these agent  about eight
times as much as by Ihe State banks, but let it be remembered
that we had a National Bank during forty years, by which, be-
sides the fifteen hundred thousand dollars paid by it as a bonus
for us charter, various benefits accrued to the Government by
having its funds transferred gratuitojsly to all parts of the Union,
its pensioners oaid without cost, and many other highly valuable
services, all not only without loas, but the Government, a  a re-
tiring partner from the concern, sold out it  stock at a premium
of 81,100000
If the ac-otint be stated with the local bank  alone, there wa 
a loss of 8900009, if with the United State  Bank alone, there
was a profit of 81 ICO.OOO; and if with the United States Bank
and the local banks together, (here wa  a profit of 8000,000,
against losses by defaulting individual agent  of 87,000,000 But,
unfortunately, the defalcations did not end on the 4th March,
18S7, but have occurred since to an extent ten times greater than
before
You, sir, weie not a member of this House at the extra sea
sion in September 1837, but some ol those gentlemen who were,
must we 1 lerollect ihe ti umpliant announcement by the then
chairm in ofthe Committee ol Ways and Means, [Mi Cambre
tENO ] al a midnight sittirg, thu 'the buh Tieasury system
was in full operation, and would be through 1838, 39,'40 ard 41,
in spitt, of lamentations heie oi elsewhere 'we fresh from the
people having |ust deteimint.il that no warrant foi it should be
lounil on the statute book
And it has been in operation, aiding nothing and blasting
evtry thing and Mib Treasurers have absconded with twenty
five hundred thousand dollars il not moie, of our money, since
the celebritpd decree ol Mi Cambieleng, who, having been re
lee ed by the people, is reapn g the rewards of Ins fidelity as mi
nis erio oneol the first courts of Europe
These several matters I commend, sir, to the constdeialion of
sundry gentlemen whoml havo in my eye, and who are proneto
condemn the banks, and praise the sub lreasury, while I refer,
fora few moments, tu he late deposite banks
1 have nothing to say about iheir being seduced to the em
braces of this Government by its promises of spendid profits—
nor of the merits of the system establ shed by the deposite law
—nor of the capacity of ¡state banks to carry on the fiscal ope
rations of the Government I speak only of the manner in
which they performed their obligations to the Government pri
or and subsequent to the suspension in May, 1837, but, Mr
Chairman, the opinions of men in high places, and who were
bound, official]y,to know all about the bueiuess, must be far bet
ter than mine, and I therefore call the attention of the commit
tee to the following item, which 1 read from the message of Gen
Jackson in December, 1834
' Happily it is already illustrated that the agency of such an
institution (as the Bank of the United States) is not necessary to
the fiscal operations of the Government Ihe State banks are
found fully adequate to the performance of all services which
were required of the Bank of the United States, quite as
promptly and with the same cheapness They have main
tamed themselves and discharged all these duties, while the
Batik of the United ¡states was still powtrful and in the field as
an open enemy, and it is not possible to conceive that they will
find greater dilficulties in their operations when that enemy
shall cease to exist "
And from the annual messaee of 1835
"Tne exper ence of another year has confirmed the uttei fal-
lacy of the idea that the Bank of the United States was necessa
ryas a fiscal agent ofthe Government Without its aid, as
such, indeed, in despite of all the embarrassments it was in its
power to create, tlieievenue has been paid with punctuality by
our citizens, the business of exchange, both foreign and domes
tic, has been conducted with convente ce, and the ciiculatmg
medium has been greatly improved By the use of the State
banks, which do not derive their charters from the General Go
veinment, and are not controlled by its authority, it is aster
tained that the moneys of the United States can be collected and
disbursed without loss or inconvenience and that all the wants
of ihecomnmniiy, in lelation to exchange and currency, are
supplied as well as ihev tver ¡uve been If, under ciicum-
stances ll e most unfavorable to the money maiket, ii has been
found that the considerations on which the Bank of ihe United
Slates rested its claims to the public tavor were imaginary and
groundless, itcannot be doubted that tre experience of the lu-
ture will be moie decisive against them "
And Mr Secretary Woodbury, in his report of the same year,
says
This (the Treasury) Department takes great pleasure in
stating that the public money continues to be collected and de-
posited under the present system of selected banks, with great
ease and economy in all cases, and withereater in some, than at
any former period The transfers of it to every quaiter of the
country where it is needed for disbursements have never been
effected with more promptitude, and have been made entirely
free of expense to ihe Treasury
"The payments to creditoie, officers, and pensioners have
been punctual and convenient, and the whole fiscal operations
through the State banks have us yet proved highly satisfactory.
Incidental to this, the facilities that have been furnished to the
commercial community in domestic exchanges werepiobably
never greater or at so moderate rates "
But the shouts of triumph were made to ru g yet louder in
the annual message of General latkson, in December, 1836
"Experience continues to realize the expectations entertained
as to ihe capacity of the State banks to perfoim the duties of
fiscal agents for the Govt rnnient at tbe time of the lemoval of
the deposites It was alleged by the advocates ol the Bank of
the United States that ihe ¡at ite bank", whatever might be the re
gulaiions ol the Treasury Depanment, could not make the
tiansfers required by the Government, or negative the domestic
exchanges ot the country Ii is now well ascertained P>at the
real domestic exchanges perlormed through discounts by the
United States Bank and its twenty five branches were at least
one third less than those of the deposite banks for an equal pe
nod of time, and il a compaña n be instituted between tbe
amounts of service rendered by these institutions, on the broader
basis which has been used by the advocates of the United States
Bank in estimating what they consider the domestic exchanges
transacted by it, the result will be still more favoiable to the de-
posite banks "
And Mr Woodbury, as in duty bound, swells the chorus
"It i  a source of high gratification to be able to add that,
while so selected and employed, noi a single dollar was lost to
the Government by any of them, or a single failure occurred to
transfer promptly and pay out satisfactorily the public money
entrusted to their charge nor is it believed that the domestic ex
changes ofthe countly were ever lower or mote regular than
during that period, and the large amount ot ihem performed by
these deposite banks in ordinary purchases or discounts, equal
ling from one hundred and forty to two hundred millions of dot
lars yearly, or near a third more than those of the same kind by
the United States Bank while the fiscal agent of the Govern
ment, evinced the great ability and usefulness of the banks on
this important subject"
We all reaollect that General Jackson, when leaving the Chair
of State on the 4th of March, 1837, delivered what he was
pleased to call a Farewell Address to his fellow citizens, in imita-
tion of the example set by the revered Father of Ins Country—
whether impiously or not, every individual will determine for
himself. For my awn part, sir, I hope no future President will
renew the experiment; and, from the ill success attending this, I
think no one will, if he has any regard for himself, or respect
for the opinions of the people.   I want my children, Mi. Chair
