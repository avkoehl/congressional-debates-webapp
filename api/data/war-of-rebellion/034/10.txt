Our losses in these operations were 85 killed, 462 wounded, and 13 missing, making in all 560.

The killed and wounded of the enemy is unknown, but we took 1,634 prisoners, of which 59 were commissioned officers. We captured six pieces of artillery, many small-arms, considerable camp equipage, and large quantities of commissary and quartermaster's stores.

After the expulsion of his army from Middle Tennessee, Bragg retreated across the Cumberland Mountains and Tennessee River upon Chattanooga, which place was fortified, and defensive works constructed at the crossings of the river as far up as Blythe's Ferry.*
