HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Louisville, Ky., September 2, 1862.

Major General LEW. WALLACE, Cincinnati, Ohio:

When I left Lexinton about 5 p. m. yesterday the force there was organized, with General Gilbert in command, with orders to fall back in an orderly manner, covering his trains, toward Covington if practicable; of not, by way of Frankfort in case the enemy appear in large force. Which route he took I am not certain, and indeed whether he has left Lexington at all, as communication with that place is cut off. If retreat is by road to Covington it may be necessary to re-enforce him, and you will hold your troops in readiness for such a movement.

We must not give up all the ground between Covington and Lexington. A stand may be made at Falmouth or Georgetown, I am not yet sure which.

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Louisville, Ky., September 2, 1862.

Major General LEW. WILLACE, Cincinnati, Ohio:

Direct Colonel Langworthy to remain at Falmouth till Colonel runkle comes up, and the two to hold the place unless compelled by superior forces to abandon it, and then to fall back on Covington. We must not give up the road between Falmouth and Covington unless absolutely forced to do so. Vigilance will secure them against surprises. They should keep mounted men patrolling all the surrounding country.

Major-General, Commanding.

Send troops to Covington as soon as they arrive. The force at Newport Barracks may be used for service in the artillery.

Major General LEW. WALLACE, Cincinnati, Ohio:

Have urged Governor Tod more than once to-day. Try him yourself. The regiment from Paris and the one from Cynthiana ought to join you soon. Use troops at Newport Barracks as artillerists. They have received some instructions. General Judah should send you all the force at Camp Dennison.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
