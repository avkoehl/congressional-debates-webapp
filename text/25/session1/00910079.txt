On motion of Mr CA-MBRELE^G-, the House
then resolved tseIf into a Committee of the Whole
on the stUe of the Union, Mr 114.YKEt> m the
chair, and lesumed the consideration of the bill to

Th" question p le'mg was on the amendment i f
Mi PIC i\.r\S to strd c li m the b 11 tne md fi 11"
c'ause 'till fi ither pío is inly 1 iw , ' and inser
"the first day of Januaiy, 1839," with the amend-
ment of Mi ADAMS, as given in last night's prot
ceedm^s
Mr MFRCFR spoke against the bill and enter-
ed at lar -? into a rexievv of, and shictures upon, the
report of the Secretary of theTieasury
Mr RENGHEll had been stiuckwith the sin-
gular course some gentleman had taken in their op-
position to this bill They had deprecated the de-
posite bill But if it had not been for the deposite
law, wheie would ÍV whole amount of surplus re-
vent have been at this time That lay had di-
vested Government of its ihnoeroiis pauonage,
and had enabled tne Slates to scatter blessings
atound them In his opinion, if ,he emeigerc of
the country required the passage of the piesent bil,
we had a right to do it But he must be sa isfied
that it was absolutely necessary for the welfare of
the country, before he w ou d y ene foi it But whv
did they wish to raise a ¿le Her sum th in the Si -
cretary lcquuel' rrhe\ xvcie about to place at the
disposal of the S"cietaiy doub'e th" amount lit
a'l ed 11 they postponed tie eupositcs to the
States at all, it would b  doic fir evei It ap-
pealed mat tne vho'e expenditure foi the p csent
year amoi-ntcdto forty cifhtmil ions, five of wb ch
weie said to be unavailable Thus th° wl ole ex- '
pe iddure of this y ear exceeded the expenditure oí
the whole teim of the administiation of the bono
rab'e gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr Adams)
wha was c'nven from office by the ci / of eitiava-
gance If this bill lid no' pass, he would vote
fer the Secietar to nave powei to i'si e Tieasmy
note-
Some gentlemen h"d opposed the odl on the
ground that it woull cteat  a nat onal debt, but
whether the bill passed or not, a national debí
wculd be ciea'cd We were called t.p m to defer
th paymert of mercha it ' bonds Those bonds
would thus be thrown on tne leven te < f ncx yeai

gies, so as *o rep'emsh the lie sur^ ¿ t emole i
theS cretaiy, by the me   s° of ¡e en«e to abso b
theTitasmy notes In two yeai , at cist, the
administration would be enabled to udeem tho^c
rotes, and men we should have no national atbt
If the bill did uji oa s, it was to be hoped thai tne
Secretary would be able to make av a 'able a great
portion of the funds which were now said to De
unavailable He was sure that none of the States
would lefuse to take the notes of their own Slate
banks He could not vote foi the bill, because he
belie ed ti e State banks would be bet'er able to
make arrangements v ith the States than with the
General Government, but the issue of Treasury
notes would assist the States, and cause a greater
influx of wealth into the Treasury by increasing
the revenue, from which means the Secretary
would be enabled to redeem them If the money
w as not distributed amo' g the States, it was very
eeitam that it would be disposed of by the same
extravagant and prodigal expeahtuies as heieto-
foif> It would be expended in tie erection of
splendid lighthouses, to enable vessels to avoid
rocks w hich the pilots themseh es could scarcely see
in the davtime It would be was'edmappiopr auons
for sp endid public edifices ol no use whatever, or
for expeditions to the polar circles for the advance-
ment of science Yes for an Exploring Exped -
tion, at the cnoimous expense of two millions,
more than had been aheady appropriated, *or the
purpose of making scientific researches, and ascer-
tai mag the diffeient degrees cf latitude and longi-
tude m the southern hemisphere, while the people
were sutfeung from the greatest distress at home
He could not vote lor the bill, because he believed
it uncalled for bv tin pre-t it condition of the
counti v, and if adoptp 1 w ould not answer the pur-
poses for which it was designed
Mi TAYLOR defended the bill, on the ground
that it vv as called for by the exigencies of the Go-
\ernmtnt, and answered the objections urged
against it
Mi BOND opposed it on the ground that the
Stales w ould buffer immense losses from the disap-
pointment of their just expect \tions hi bei íg de-
pi < d ot that t > which t "y were justly ontided,
ai d which thry had i y ( y íe isontoexocci And that
alihou di the Secretary might not be able to get
specie from the deposite banks, the Stales would not
object to receive the notes of their own banks in
payment of their respectiv e shares He contended
that the people weie being experimented on in the
same way that philosophers experimented on dogs
and rabbits, althouirh they frequently died under
such expt umerts
Mi BOND continued his remarks He was m
favoi ol a Well reguhted national bank for the
nurposc of regulating the currency He thought
s ich an lnstitu ícn migb' Le framed, from the ex-
pedience of tl e last fifty years, so as to b„ bci efi-
cial to the countiv He cons dered the object of
the present Congicss w as the benefit of the people,
but, in h s opinion, the bill before them woald af-
foid no rnannei of relief
[4.1 the close of thu gentleman's remarks, a cry
of duestion" arose in various parUof the IIoUt.e ]
Mi C4.MBRELENG said, that if they would
piomi e the question should be taken that ni"hl, he
di \ not mind how late they lcmamed but if other-
wise, he hoped gendemen v ould have some con-
suleiatun for the health oe those who had been
ekpriv ed of their rest last n ght
