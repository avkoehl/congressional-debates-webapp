Michael of course I cannot connect with General Ricketts. I am awaiting the arrival of an officer to show my new position. In the dark woods it is impossible to form unless conducted by some one who knows the ground.

Respectfully,

FRANCIS C. BARLOW,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND, CORPS,June 21, 1864-10 a. m.

General MOTT,

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you send the Second Regiment of Sharpshooters to the head of the column to report to General Barlow.

Your obedient servant,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

He directs that you keep up your connection with General Barlow, holding your two reserve brigades in readiness to use against any attack by the enemy on the left, and throw your pickets well forward.
