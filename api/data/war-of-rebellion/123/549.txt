COLUMBUS, OHIO, September 16, 1862-1 p. m. (Received 4.20 p. m.)

General C. P. BUCKINGHAM:

The Eighty-fourth, Eighty-fifth, and Eighty-eighth, all three- months" regiments, are at Camp Chase awaiting their pay, to be mustered out, and, although proper requisitions were made, not a dollar of money here to pay them. If you have any regard for me beg your prompt interference.

DAVID TOD,

Governor.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., September 16, 1862.

Governor TOD,

Columbus, Ohio:

Your telegram to General Buckingham in respect to pay of three- months" regiments received. It is impossible to pay faster than money can be had from the Treasury. I have more millions now in the Treasury unanswered than you would like to hear of. I can scarcely get money enough to pay bounty. Pray do not be impatient for a delay that cannot be helped.

EDWIN M. STANTON.
