Immediacy following this the whole of
said cotton was taken possession of by Captain
Samuel Lappin, assistant quartermaster ot
volunteers in charge of steamboat and water
transportation at Mobile, and who was on duty
shipping captured cotion from that port under
the authority of the military commander and
the supervising special agent of the Treasury
Department. As soon as claimants were in-
formed that their cotton was being loaded on
vessels to be shipped away they remonstrated
with Captain Lappin, and showed to him that
their cotton was private property, brought to the
city under a safe conduct from General Granger,
and stored and to be protected under the permit
and order of that officer, who was then absent
from the city. Captain Lappin stated in reply
that when he loaded the cotton he supposed it
was a portion of that captured, and that as it
was now mostly loaded he would furnish them
with a bill of lading on the part of the United
States, and they could proceed to New York,
claim the cotton, and the agent there would
undoubtedly turn it over to them. Accord-
ingly, claimants procured insurance on the
same, paying premium of $4,000 therefor, and
proceeded to New York and claimed the
amount as stated in their bill of lading. The
Secretary of the Treasury declined to turn
over the cotton to them at once, but had it
stored in warehouses, when claimants again
procured insurance on it, and awaited the final
action of the Secretary. And finally the cot-
ton was ordered to be sold, and the proceeds
thereof to be separately accounted for; so
that the claim could be more easily adjusted
after it was thoroughly investigated.
The committee, after citing the testimony of
General Granger as to the title to the cotton
and his own action concerning it, say that the
voluminous evidence submitted shows conclu-
sively that few men suffered greater indignities
and fiercer persecution on account of their
loyalty to the United States than these claim-
ants, and few did more to aid the cause of the
Union than they. Every sacrifice seems to
have been endured by them but the actual sub-
mission to the attempted coercion of marching
in rebel ranks. Imprisoned and threatened
with death, the halter prepared to facilitate
that dread event, the age and feebleness of the
parties, became their only protection. Their
fortunes mostly confiscated and destroyed, the
remnants of all they possessed are found in
the nine hundred and twenty-five bales of cot-
ton here in question. Now upward of seventy
years of age, the claimants have neither hope
for the future nor means of subsistence for the
present, except in the justice of their Govern-
ment, to which they appeal to restore to them
their own and their all.
Under these circumstances, and from the
considerations which follow, the Committee of
Claims, after a most careful examination, have
unanimously agreed to recommend the passage
of the bill, restoring to claimants the value of
the cotton taken and sold, deducting the
charges and expenses of the United States as
found and stated at the Treasury Department.
The bill was laid aside to be reported to the
House, with the recommendation that it do
pass.
