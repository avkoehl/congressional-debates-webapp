GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPT. OF NORTH CAROLINA, Numbers 7. March 25, 1862.

The enemy are before us and must advance at an early day. If we do not defeat him North Carolina will be under his worse than vandal despotism. Let us all, then, give ourselves up, body and mind, to the sacred duties of her defense. To effect this the strictest discipline must be preserved, and the commanders of companies, regiments, and brigades are required to enforce the most exact obedience to all orders and regulations. Until further orders no furloughs will be granted, nor will any officer or soldier be permitted to leave his camp without permission from his brigade commander. The most active system of drills will be instituted, and every commanding officer is held responsible that his command is ready to march at a moment's notice.
