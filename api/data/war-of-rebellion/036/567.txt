CAPTAIN OF STEAMER:

SIR: You will have your boat in readiness at 9 o'clock this evening, in the middle of the river, at Young's Point, ready to move at the signal given by me. I will be alongside, and give the signal in person to each boat. The line of boats will be as follows: Tigress (flagship), Empire City, Moderator, J. W. Cheeseman, Anglo-Saxon, and Horizon. You will have your crew in their proper places, with instructions to remain at their posts. This is an important movement, and I trust every officer and man will do his duty.

Colonel Clark B. Lagow, aide-de-camp to General Grant, is on board the Tigress, and will take charge of the fleet under way.

Yours, respectfully,

GEO. W. GRAHAM,

Commanding Fleet,
