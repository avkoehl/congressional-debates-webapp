yourself, so I can meet you on my arrival. The move will be made by parts of your command and Chalmers', with an additional force. At least four pieces of your artillery will be required. See that your horses are in good trim and your ammunition in order. Hurry up your arms and accouterments and have them distributed. Try and collect sufficient bacon for six days. In the mean time get all the information as to the troops and their locality at the different points in your front. Give your attention to Richardson, and have his command near you, so he can move. He reports he will be ready for the 1st of October. It is unnecessary, general, for me to say that any preparation you may make can be screened under the guise of increased discipline and vigilance. Have asked to have the gap made by Roddey's removal filled by General Clanton's brigade. Of course the arrangement above directed would be countermanded by any move of the enemy requiring your action.

Yours, respectfully,

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.

CONFIDENTIAL.] HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY IN MISSISSIPPI,

Canton, September 22, 1863.

Brigadier General J. R. CHALMERS,

Commanding Cavalry Brigade:

GENERAL: I propose making an expedition from your vicinity soon, and I desire you to have the most reliable part of your command well in hand and in good trim as to horses, ammunition, &amp;c. It would be well to have on hand sufficient bacon and flour not only for your own command, but for an additional force, say 1,200 men, for not to exceed eight days. See to this quietly, so as to avoid any suspicion as to a move. Give directions to prevent any passing and repassing between your lines and the enemy, except by your scouts and spies, who should be active in the mean time. You should at once prevent all trading, particularly from Panola. I want you to have me several reliable guides well posted in all the country, including the locality of Memphis and La Grange, and desire at once the locality of the troops in the vicinity of the two points mentioned, as also at other points. I will send your arms up to-morrow; they will reach you in ample time. It is unnecessary, general, for me to remark how important secrecy is in this matter. Your command should not be aware of any move being contemplated. It can all be arranged under a show of increased discipline and vigilance. Send General Ferguson's dispatches to him by a trusty officer.

Yours, respectfully,

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.

The stores must be collected at several points in the vicinity of Oxford so as to avoid suspicion.

S. D. L.,

Major-General.

Have two of your pieces well fitted up as horse artillery. Should have said allow all persons to come in our lines; no one to go out.

S. D. L.
