call upon them We had, however, a guarantee
now, which did not exist then, and that was m
the regulation of the standard of our metallic cur-
rency, by which" it would be kept from exporta-
Mr P said he would now conclude with
hopin°- that the House would not so embarrass
and trammel the bill as, in the judgment of those
in favor of it, and of those who would be called
upon to execute it, to render it imp-acticable, and
thereby give the vantage ground to the Bank of
the Unifcd States He was anxious that the
pub'ic should be secured m every possible way,
but he could see no additional safeguards in the
propositions of the gentleman from Pennsylva-
One word in regard to these amendments He
did not know whether it was improper to allude
to what had occurred elsewhere, but this he might
say, that the proposition now moved by the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania was not heard of when
theoiiginal bill was discussed in the Committee
of Ways and Means The provision relative to
specie payments was inserted in the present bill,
though Mr P had deemed it unnecessary last
session, still he tnought it could do no harm Mr
P concluded, by trusting the House would aller
its dec ision by reconsidering its vote and rejecting
the ame dment                                                              I
Mi BINiS EY spoke at consid-rable length, in
íeply to the arguments of Mr Polk, and going
to show that the amendment introduced by him,
and proposed to be reconsidered, would be salu
tary in its tendency, and necessary in its operation
on the general influence of the bill It was not
unreasonable to require of each of the deposite
banks to retain within their vaults at least one-
fit h of the amount in «pecie of its circulation aid
dcpo«i'es He pursued his argument and reply
for upv ards of an hour, contending that the
amendment pioposed nothing but what the local
banks weie fully able to meet The converse of
this opinion must arise from a want of informa-
tion as to their real si uation, highly injurious to
t'iem                                                   ,   „                   ,
Mi CAMBRELENG followed He expressed
hi* satisfaction at hearing the opinion's from the
gentl man fiom Pennsylvaria, [Mr Bivney,] that
the State banks were in such high reputation He
believed t was the first time such an admission
had come fnoi that quarter of the House Mr C
t ic i proceeded to show his reasons for advocating
a recons deration of the amendment of tfce gentle-
man from Pennsylvania, among which was the
fact that the b ink had no effec ual control over the
public moneys deposited m their vaults which
we e lis e to be drtwn and transferred by the
Gove-nmenta any momert On the su ,ect of a
haid mo ey system he be'i-ved he would go as
fat ib nat gen leman He conclude!, by repeat-
,n r his convi-non tha' the reconsideration should
prev nl and th  amendment be exp mged
Mi vli-iv'NLLA then addies^ed the House at
len ih ip fa  n of a reconsideration of the amend-
ment He appealed to the House to decide now
whether th-y we-e prenareJ to sanction in this
bi a system which would mos> inevitably hive
bioken do n the o'd one, or to put upon these
insiitu 10 is such restrictions as none could-bear
Mr SC \ BORIS JONTES, of Geotgia, next. olv

was then taken by yeas and nays, and decided in

So the House agreed to reconsider the amend
ment
Mr. S JONES, of Georgia, then proposed his
amendment above-alluded to, as an amendment to
the one preceding
It was rejected without a division
Mr MILLER here moved the previous ques-
tion, which would be on the engrossment of the

the negative, being counted by tellers
Mr CLAY then moved an adjournment, which
prevailed—ayes 105, noes 48

REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
Mi WEBSTER, from the Committee on Fi-
nance, to which was referred the bill further to
suspend the operation of certain provisos of the

Mr WEBSTER said, that the act of 1832, in
the 10th and 12th sections, provided that the col
lection of the duties on hardware, being impracti-
cable in some of its provisions, should be suspended
for a year, and in the mean time the Secietary of
the Treasury was to make examination into the
practicability of carrying it into effect Mr W
read a passage from the late report of the Secre-
taiy, to show that it was now expedient to con-
tinue to suspend the operation of these provisos
until the end of next session of Congress, which
this bill provided tie hoped, as it was necessary
the bill snould pass, that the Senate would take
it up and let it have its several readings at this

nance, reported the bill fiom the House for the

CIRCUIT COURT SYSTEM.
Mr   FRELINGHUYSEN   gave notice that

THE VETO POWER
On motion of Mr KENT, the Senate took up
for consideration, as in Committee of the Whole,
the joint resolution introduced by him, to amend
the Constitution relative to the veto power.
Mr KENT desired to occupy but a few mo-
ments of the time of the Senate on this subject.
He was at all times opposed to any hasty altera-
tions of the Constitution No man respected that
instrument more than himself, nor was any one
more inclined to cherish it, but while he enter-
tained these feelings, he regarded the liberties of
the country still more There was always ground
to fear, in disturbing the movements of the Gov-
ernment, lest we rush from one evil to another
and a greater The framers of the Constitution
were far from believing that time and experience
would not disclose latent defects in it—they there-
fore left it to future times to amend such defects
Look only to the prerogatives and claims of the
Executive at this day, and you will see that the
amendment proposed is the only remedy for this
evil
The veto power as exercised tends to unite the
legislative   and   executive powers,   than  which
nothing is more dangerous, and the concentration
of them in one hanu. is despotism, and leads to
oppression     This has been boldly held forth by
our patriotic ancestors, when they asserted that
the people alone could enact laws by which the
people  could  be  bound     This  provision was
designed only to prevent legislative encroachment
upon the executive authority, they never designed
it to operate upon matters involving no constitu-
tional objections   Thesedoctrmes we fird through-
out the  instrument,  particularly by that which
says the whole legislative power shall be vested
I in  Congress    It is  a  principle,  that the law-
making power should be vested in the representa-
I tives of the people, who are responsible for the
I proper performance of their duties   If this power
I ever pass from the people, it is easy to perceive
tne first step is to perpetuate this power,and every
¡ succeeding act would be one of encioaehment and
oppression   All legislative power being thus vested
m the two Houses, they, and they only, can malta
laws     It is manifest, therefore, that no Pres.dent
is justified in interfering with this power further
than to protect himself    It was intended not to
be active but defensive, and to guard against in-
adver ent legislation     The first practical exposi-
tion of this power wnl be found m a communica-
tion of Thomas Jefferson     The closing sentence
of this opinion of Mi   Jeflfcrson is, that where
the Piesident's opinion is equally balanced ajust
respect for the Legislature would incline him to
lean to their opimoi , and he acted upon tins prn -
ciple, never having vetoed a bill during his eight
vears'term     [Mr K he e read fiom Mr Madi-
son's writings upon the definition of a despotism,
and, also, from Blackstone's Commentaries rela-
tive to the English veto power, also, from Mr
Hamilton*!. Federalist, to show that the veto should
always be exercised with great caution ]    lftere
are many reasons why a King of England should
I have the power wh ch will not apply to a Presi
dent of the United States    The King is a neiedi-
| tary monarch, bound to see his subjects   rights
Weierved  unmolested     He convenes and  pio-
To"ues the Parliament, and notwithstanding the
power of an absolute negative, he has abstained
