make every preparation to carry fully your orders respecting this place.

I telegraphed you to-day I had sent 96 mules by wagon road to Hall's Landing, thence via Mobile to Corinth. I had no harness or wagons for them. I also asked to be allowed to retain Colonel Jones and the Twenty-seventh Mississippi Regiment a few days beyond the time you have allowed me to accomplish the work in hand, and I trust that you will allow me to do so. My reason for asking this I will explain more fully in another letter, probably to-night. The mail will close before I could give my reasons in this. In your telegram of yesterday for 32-pounder barbette carriages to be sent to Memphis you did not say if you wanted the guns and ammunition with them.

Your telegram (the only one I have received since you left Mobile) I received late last night, and of course have not yet forwarded the carriages, as it was necessary to dismount the guns at night.

I shall look most anxiously for news from West Tennessee, and hope you will keep me advised of your movements in that quarter.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAM. JONES,

Brigadier-General.

O'BANNONSVILLE, FLA., March 5, 1862.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Shall I send with the 32-pounder barbette carriages the guns and ammunition pertaining to them?

SAM. JONES,

Brigadier-General.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Jackson, Tenn.:

Your telegram of yesterday received. Barbette carriages and all ordnance and stores called for will be forwarded as rapidly as possible. No railroad communication with Mobile until yesterday. First Alabama started to-day for Memphis. Ninety-six mules left yesterday for Corinth, Miss. Negro laborers arrived last night and this morning. Do let me keep Colonel Jones and his regiment a few days at least beyond the time you have allowed me. My movements here have been greatly retarded by want of transportation and laborers.

SAM. JONES,

Brigadier-General.

NEW ORLEANS, LA., March 5, 1862.

Honorable J. P. BENJAMIN:

Vanderbilt powder had to be reworked, Victoria powder was all musket, and Miramon powder not arrived. Shall I send musket powder?

M. LOVELL.
