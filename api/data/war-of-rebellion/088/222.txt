General GRANT:

This evening General Mott, by making a strong demonstration on the enemy's right, brought off the gun left by General Birney day before yesterday, together with three loads of ammunition which have been covered by the enemy since that time. The gun was an 8-inch siege howitzer, and the ammunition belongs to guns of that caliber.

I send for your information the following dispatch from General Butler.*

I have ordered to Strawberry Plains steamers ostensibly to bring down the Second Corps. It is intended as a ruse to make the enemy believe you are withdrawing, and to bring them out to attack you. Send orders to the steamers to return here at 4 a.m. in the morning.
