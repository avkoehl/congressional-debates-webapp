horses. No news from Forrest's force yet. Granger has given the result of Colonel Patrick's reconnaissance to Guy's Gap. He was opposed by both cavalry and a small detachment of infantry. Colonel Watkings sent the Sixth Kentucky to Versailles to-day, thinking Mitchel still there. The regiment has not yet been heard from, but no doubt it is all right. The Fifth Kentucky is at Murfreesborough, probably. Colonel Patrick had only 1 man wounded. We took only 1 prisoner.

SIR: The general commanding this corps directs that you move at once with your command of cavalry to Lumley's Stand.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Beech Grove, June 26, 1863-2.15 p. m.

Major General THOMAS. CRITEENDEN:

The general commanding has arrived at this place. General Thomas has driven the enemy 2 1\2 miles toward Fairfield. General Granger is advancing toward Matt's Hollow, and hopes to reach the head of it to-night. General McCook is holding Liberty Gapwith apart of his force; the remainder will join us here. There have been about 200 casualties thus far. Except the bad weather, all goes well. We hope you will get within reach of Manchester to-night, if possible. Your difficulties of route are appreciated. Headquarters will be here till further orders. News from the East mixed, as usual.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Beech Grove, June 26, 1863-5.15 p. m.

Major General THOMAS L. CRITTENDEN:

Your dispatch of 4.10 p. m. is received. The general commanding appreciates the obstacles you have to encounter; he does not, therefore, expect you to reach manchester, but desires you to make as much of the distance as possible. In view of the fact, it may not be safe to keep the cavalry as far forward as first intended. Push on early in the morning. The road is much better from Lumley's Stand.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
