the face of the earth.
Let me take the exports for one year from the
two countries, Great Britain and our own, from
which the Senate will be able to see their relative
proportions anil discrepancies:

We have here the staple article, can manufac-
ture as cheap, if not cheaper, than England, the
expense of transportation quite as small, and there
is no reason in the world why this marked differ-
ence should exist. This trade is ours by all laws
of geography, and we should not permit it to pass
from oar hands.
But to return to the objection of the Senator
from Massachusetts. I feel perfectly authorized
in saying, and 1 believe in so doing 1 express the
wish of my constituency, that if Congress would
pass this bill and give our commerce the protection
these steamers would afford, traveling monthly
throughout the entire northern Pacific, u c&n with-
draw every vessel it has now in the northern Pa-
cific, costing the Government at present between
one and two millions of dollars. I do not mean
to disparage the efforts and energies of our ships
of war stationed on the Pacific coast, for I believe
they do all they can, but they are of little if any
protection to the whalingtrade, or to the American
trade that is engaged m our northern Pacific.
Why, sir, of what benefit, except for that isolated
and local protection,is the stationingof the Cyanc
in the bay of Acapulco, or the Lancaster in the
bay of Panama: None, whatever. If an outrage
is committed or a wrong of any kind inflicted by
any foreign Government, before we could get re-
dress a long time must elapse, besides trusting to
the uncertainties of negotiation and diplomacy.
Once give us a line like this constituting the militia
of the seas, traveling periodically from San Fran-
cisco to the Sandwich Islands, to Japan, and to
China, and it would be of more benefit and of
more protection to our commerce than all the ves-
sels now located in the whole Pacific, both north-
ern and southern. Having shown you that the
Lancaster alone costs nearly half a million annu-
ally, the whole subsidy we ask for this entire line;
and if cconomy is your object, after giving us this,
take away your war vessels, and place them where
they may be of greater service to the country.
Mr. President, this is a measure which the con-
stituency I represent have very much at heart.
It occupies the attention of the commercial peo-
ple of that coast more than any other, except the
groat Pacific railroad. It has been asked for not
only by our Legislature and by our Chamber of
Commerce, but by repeated petitions, praying
that this commerce, given to us by nature, shall
not pass forever from us. I know the belief on
the part of some is that the State itself is per-
fectly able to take care of itself; but it strikes me
that any such idea is a very contracted one. If
you intend to put these remote portions of the
country on their proper basis as a portion of the
Union, you must give them equal and necessary
assistance as well as protection from foreign ag-
gression. Why, sir, I hold in my hand a tabic
of the annual gold productions of the State of
California, a large proportion of which, as I en-
deavored to show the other day, would have long
since found its way across the Pacific by this
proposed means, had Congress seen fit to estab-
lish it, enriching us, instead of foreign countries.
The table shows that during the short time of
our existence, from 1849 down to the present pe-
riod, the yield of gold in that State has amounted
to over seven hundred and seventy one millions
of dollars, as follows:

Not long since a memorial, bearing date of De-
cember 5, 1861, was presented from the Chamber
of Commerce of the city of New York, in which
I find the following statement: .
"To all the considerations before, mentioned may be
added the fact that the foieign coimneiee of the State of
New York lias iucie.i^od, >ince the fust export of Califor-
nia gold at this port, about two hundred per cent
In 1849 the imports of that port (New York
city) wore $92,507,369; the exports $45,963,100;
making a total of $138,530,469.
In 1860 the imports were $248,489,877; the ex-
ports $143,553,449; makinga total of $394,045,326,
or an increase during the tim'1 these shipments of
gold had continued of $235,514,857.
Fueling loth to occupy any more time of the
Senate, 1 shall now leave the matter in the hands
of those who are best able to judge of the interests
of the Government and of their sense of duty m
the premises. Whatever may be the result of this
bill, whether passed by the Senate or rejected, I
can only feel that I have done my duty, and a
pleasant one, in presenting and urging upon the
consideration of this body all the facts available
and patent within my reach that would in any
way convince or favorably influence your judg-
ments.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question
is on the amendment moved by the Senator from
California.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I am not aware of the
relative merits of the original bill and the amend-
ment; 1 have heard the amendment read, but I do
not know what the provisions of the bill are. I
suppose, however, from the confidence I have in
my friend from California, and his knowledge of
the subject and general accuracy of views, that
the amendment is undoubtedly an improvement
upon the bill. But, sir, I am opposed to both of
them at the present time; 1 am opposed to the
thing w hatcver shape it may assume. I am dis-
posed to be liberal in my votes on all these mat-
ters, and have been heretofore, and I do not know
but what under another state of things in the coun-
try 1 should be disposed to give my support to
tins object on looking into it and being satisfied
that the good effects might be likely to flow from
it which'are supposed by the Senator from Cali-
fornia. But the Senate is aware and the country
is aware that we have heretofore in the period of
our legislation, adopted, to a certain extent, this
system of subsidizing steamers, paying subsidies
in the shape of postal arrangements m order to
facilitate and increase trade. I do not know but
that the object is a legitimate one. It was at all
events one that recommended itself to Congress
and was tried; but the Senate must be equally
aware that after a trial of that system for several
years, it was deliberately laid aside and abandoned
by Congress, at a period, too, when the country
was in a high state of prosperity, its finances en-
tirely unembarrassed,and when we were perfectly
able to undertake such a system and carry it on.
Perhaps it was unwise to abandon jt.
One would think, however, that if it was to be
recommenced, it should be recommenced where
our trade is the largest and most direct, and espe-
cially with reference to postages where it would
be likely to yield something like a return. Wfe
must be aware that this being established under
the Post Office Department, amounts to nothing
and can amount to nothing comparatively; it is a
mere cover for the greater object, the ulterior ob-
ject, of promoting and protecting trade. I am a
friend to that, and at a proper time and under
proper circumstances I should be willing to avail
myselfof any provision of the Constitution which
would enable me to accomplish that purpose rea-
sonably; but at the present time I am averse to
any of these undertakings which are matters of
experiment alone, although there are the fairest
prospccts that the experiment will succeed; and
1 am opposed to it simply for the reason that we
have on our hands now an undertaking which
will tax our resources to the utmost, and is doing
so at the present time. We have a large amount
of debt unpaid; we are put to the use of all our
energies, of all our capabilities, to get along with
that which is absolutely pressing upon us as a
necessity.
Now, however favorable I might be to -this ob-
ject, and however willing I may be—and certainly
nobody has shown himself more so by his votes
than I have—to advance the interests of our friends
upon the Pacific coast by every legitimate means
in the world, even for tiiem I am unwilling to de-
vote such large sums of money to undertakings
of this description. I think that our friends there,
as well as in other parts of the country, can afford
to wait for a short period of time until the coun-
try shall be able to resume its oiiginal position,
and be able to appropriate something for this pur-
pose.
I will not go into a review of any po#tron of the
argument of the honorable Senator. I think some
of his suggestions can be readily met and an-
swered, while others it might be more difficult to
manage. Leaving all that out of the question, I
must call the attention pf the Senate to the fact
that it is as much as we can possibly do with the
necessities on hand to meet the obligations of the
Government; and I do not think we should be
held excusable at the present time for returning
again to a system or an undertaking which leads
to a system that was once commenced, and was,
in days of prosperity, deliberately abandoned. I
may not have agreed with the policy of abandon-
ing that system at the time we did, and in the
manner we did; but if those times had been these,
if we were then in the same position that we are
now, I should have had no doubt that this was a
piopcr point at which we could save the expend-
iture of money. I trust the time is not far dis-
tant when the resources of the country will en-
able us to return to any system that has been found
beneficial, or that we may judge beneficial here-
after; but I think that our friends on the Pacific
are pressing a little too hard when they tell us
that measures like this, in which we agree, those
matters important to themselves in which we may
think alike, and which we may be disposed to
encourage and sustain at the earliest possible op-
portunity, s.hould be pressed and undertaken at a
moment like this.
That is my general view of the subject, and, for'
my own pait, I am unwilling to consider any
proposition of this description having reference to
improvements and facilities in trade, and other
matters of which we are all unquestionably in
favor, that can be postponed without material
injury. I admit the existence of the truth that a
nation must depend foi its ability to supportitself
in war, in a time of great expenditure, upon its
resources, upon trade and commeice,and the other
great sources of national wealth; but we cannot
originate them in time of war; they must be ori-
ginated in time of peace. This is no time to take
out of the Treasury money which we have not,
if I may so express myself; money which is ab-
solutely essential for our daily expenditures, and
which cannot be dispensed with for those pur-
poses, and apply it to untried experiments, much
less to experiments which have been tried and
failed, so far as revenue was concerned. As a
member of the Committee on Finance,and having
more particularly in view the resources of.the
country with reference to meeting what we must
meet daily, I feel it my duty to place this simple
and single view of the subject before Congress in
