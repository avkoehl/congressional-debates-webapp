Yours, respectfully,

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, August 22, 1863.

General S. COOPER:

Rosecrans has now arrived in heavy force to this side of the mountains. Buckner reports Burnside moving on him in force. Our line is too long for our present means. Is it possible to send us assistance? The town was raked yesterday by the enemy's artillery from commanding heights across the river. This we cannot prevent. Very slight damage.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

CHATTANOOGA, August 22, 1863.

General HILL:

DEAR GENERAL: General B[ragg] arrived last evening. He wishes you to know that his general plan is to await developments of the enemy and when his point of attack is ascertained, to neglect all smaller affairs and fall on him with our whole force.

He further instructs me to say that he hopes you will at all times, in person or by letter, give him any suggestion that may occur to you in furtherance of this great and common cause. You cannot, general, offend even by importunity. He has called on Richmond and on Johnston for re-enforcements.

Yours, respectfully,

W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff.

Brigadier General S. A. M. WOOD,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Captain Hammett has just been across the river at the landing. Royster, a citizen and Unionist, was on opposite bank desiring to get Mrs. Johnston across. He says that all the Yankees have been ordered from this place to report at headquarters, which he thought was at Poe's, at foot of the mountain. He says that he thinks the intention is to attempt to cross the river to-night near the mouth of Chickamauga. One brigade has been here to-day (about 4,000); came up this morning; had but two pieces of artillery here, all commanded by Colonel Funkhouser.

Respectfully,

SAML. ADAMS,

Colonel, Commanding, &c.
