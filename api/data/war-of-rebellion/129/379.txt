The tithe in South Carolina now on hand is estimated at 1,000,000 pounds.

a At Wilmington.

b No report. Several thousand head believed to be on hand in that State.

From this it will be seen that there is an excess on hand this year of cattle and a decrease in bacon.

There is also a very considerable amount secured by the tax in kind; how much cannot be stated in the absence of reports from the tax-in-kind bureau, which could not have been expected to report so soon after the time at which the meat became due under the law, but it is believed that the number of pounds, if the meat can be collected in good condition and properly taken care of, will be sufficient to take the troops well on into the summer, and, with the addition of the supplies now reported on hand and those that are believed to be at Bermuda and Nassau (if the two last shall be in good condition), there will be enough to last them until the fall of the year.

But it is feared that the condition of much of the meat will not be good. Some of that at Bermuda has been lying in that climate nearly one year for want of transportation. The tithe meat has been much of it paid in soon as due by parties who wished to save the loss that would result from keeping it longer. A great deal of meat so paid is understood to be imperfectly salted and smoked and to be accumulating at points in the interior where it cannot be properly taken care of and whence it cannot be removed, at least with sufficient dispatch, for want of transportation. How far these causes may operate to cut short the supply cannot be estimated.

Under the comparative scarcity of subsistence the Army has been reduced, as is known, to much less than what is called the regulation rations but it is believed with much less discomfort or suffering to the troops than was anticipated, with but little dissatisfaction on their part, and, it is hoped, with a better effect on their health than was produced by the wasteful issue of full rations. The vegetables issued have been mainly rice and peas. These were all that could be had. Efforts were made to engage cabbages, at least to the extent of hospital supply; but the uncertainty of army movements and hospital necessities; the newness of that sort of culture to our people, and, more than all, the state of the currpeople to make
