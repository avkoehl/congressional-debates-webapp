HEADQUARTERS VALLEY DISTRICT,September 3, 1864.

General BRECKINRIDGE:

GENERAL: General Early directs that you move as soon as you are ready, without reference to Ramseur. Send one division direct to Bunker Hill with your wagons, move the other division on the road from Brucetown to Fry's Mill, and send a brigade as far as the Opequon to ascertain if there is any movement of the enemy. If there is then move the division over to its old camp by the road we followed yesterday. Send a battery with this division.

Respectfully,

A. S. PENDLETON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
