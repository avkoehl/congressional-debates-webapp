HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 19, 1864-10.15 p.m.

Major-General WARREN:

Hancock's people will remain to-night in their present position to await the developments of the morning. Wright's 5,000 will also be moved near here. I have no doubt the movement of Hill was to support Ewell and extricate him from the scrape he ought to have gotten into.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

WARREN'S HEADQUARTERS,

May 19, 1864-10.30 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

Colonel Bankhead has just returned from the scene of the operation this evening. He confirms Major Roebling's statement. The enemy are cutting trees considerably either for a roadway or an abatis. General Crawford has command of three brigades of mine and of Colonel Kitching's brigade. They are on the left, General Tyler's men are in the center, General Birney toward the right. Does your order continue in force, now that these troops, remain, for me to superintended the posting of them? I believe all is being done now that can be to-night.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 19, 1864-11 p.m.

Major-General WARREN:

Hancock is ordered to attack Ewell at daylight in the morning. You will direct Crawford and Kitching to attack at the same time on Birney's left.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

FIFTH CORPS, May 19, 1864-11.15 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I believe from the reports recently received that our losses this evening are much less than at first reported. Perhaps in all not exceeding 500 killed and wounded.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS, May 19, 1864-8.45 p.m.

[General WARREN:]

GENERAL: A prisoner just taken says that he belongs to Daniel's brigade, of Rodes' division, Ewell's corps. He says that the whole corps crossed the river this morning. There is no doubt but that the enemy is in force.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

The artillery regiments are not at all reliable. The Second New York will not stand.
