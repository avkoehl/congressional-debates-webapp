Army we will not return north of the Potomac River during the present hostilies without the permission of the Secretary of War of the United States.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, Va., June 3, 1862.

Mr. FULTON, Baltimore, Md.

SIR: I am requested by General Dix to say to you that he has seen in the New York Times and Herald a notice of his departure from Baltimore, which he supposes was furnished by the agent of the Associated Press, in the latter part of which a gross misstatement is made. The portion alluded to is in relation to the female prisoners, Mrs. Greenhow, Mrs. Morris and Baxley. The women were in charge of an officer of the First U. S. Volunteer Cavalry, accompanied by a guard of six men. The general gave him orders to keep them in close confinement with a guard over them with instruction to allow no communication with any one whatever, which order he has every reason to believe was strictly carried out. Besides the guard they were accompanied by the warden of the Old Capitol Prison. The statement that they were permitted to hold a regular "levee" must therefore seem to be a pure misapprehension.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILSON BARSTOW,

Aide-de-Camp.

* Mrs. C. V. Baxley and Mrs. Augusta Heath Morris were the other parties included in this order. Fort their cases see post.
