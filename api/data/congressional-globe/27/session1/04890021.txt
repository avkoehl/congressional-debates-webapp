Repeal of Independent Treasury—Mr. Wright,
Senate.
pelled to use banK <>l this de^ci ption, but he would
be stripped of every fac 1 ty in th; business of his
Department untd he uil m^ke his selection among;
the banks, and place the money the e. He in-
vited gentlemen to pat inquiries to tl>e p'esent
Secretary of the Treasury, and tee what an-
swers they would get Tne moment this bi 1
became a law, the receivers general, as such, were
dead—the Secretary could no longer draw on them.
Where moot he put h.s mone>? What must he do
with his draft -? In New Yo-k immense sums we e
coming wo deposite a' the rate oí ten to fifty thou-
sand dollars a d?y. The Secrptery could not ar
rang  with a bank to receive ibis money under le <s
than a week, and m the ineanumb the Collectoi or
the Receiver-Genera1 might have half a million of
dollars jnder Iks 1 ok and key, and be at the came
time opt of office Wno wo.ild be bable then1 Not
his sureties, forfr>tr<ewiunds; tK n liabilities exp^r'd
with his ofiije In fe muteilis'ant p iris of the
country, such a sia'e of th ngs t-wght exis' for a
whole motitn. Ti'at time must e'apse before the
Receiver kn=.v'hu his ctfiee was aho'i hed, bm
the Secretary h-re would kno v it, and couic' not
draw upo i him. Wnat, t1 en, mu t be the n sui 1
In one portion of the countr\ he would dr^ v on
collector ; in anothei portion ne mu-t act uneer the
law ot 1836, and m mi1! a'iother b- ,nust be \ rl at
his discretion, ui 'er a confio ion oí the o'd a1".
Here would bs thres or four fisc" s* stems in rpe-
ration at one and (he saeie time, ami all thii stjtt,
of confusion mu" ensue because cen'tem-n wou'd
insist upon repealing one pian before they had pro-
vided ano'her.
In tie mean time, what was to be done with the
contracts for Í ¡¡tiding— vn's the new vaul's, books,
and furniture? Wher shotili naMial an I district
attornejs depo°it their collection*—ofu n raits nsi,?
How ^boul' p<itini-es or p stmasiprs get alone'!
All would be eft in rbsos. It wou d be co fu ion

Mr. CLAY here jnterpesed to mqa.re 0' Mr.
W whether he ngh ly undeistot d him as now ad-
m ttmg that the Sub-Trea^jry was a bank.
Mr WOODBURY replied m ihe ncga.ive. Your
speeeh had rep#erented <t a^ a built only under the
supposition that the S< crctary could cut up his
1 el ' in
I  !>  1
drafts into small sums, and use them as bank
notes.
Mr. CLA V    Well, and could he not do it?
Mr. WOODBURY He did not do it. I admit
that the argument itself is a fair one, but he did not
do it, nor could it have been done without sanction
of law, nor was it ever intended to be done, unless
required by Congress to do it.
It would then be only a bank of circulation, but
not 3UO of deposite for individuals, nor one of dis-
count at al1; which last bind of bank was made,
and especially a Nal.onal one, so open to politaic
favoritism and corruption.
I will not, on thu occasion, detain the Senate
longer, and «id not intend at this time to say half
so much.
SPEECH OF MR. WRIGHT,
OF NEW \ORK
in Senate, June 9, 1841—On the bill for the repeal
of the Independent Treasury law.
Mr WRIGHT said Mr President, I am not
surprised o- disappointed that ou>- respected oppo-
nents leave Pidusively to us the debate upon the
fi'iHl passnte of tins hi!1 I know that power is
sometimes more anxious to execute its purposes
thati to sivo repsons for its course, lo dD execution
tlan to offer aigumcnls in justification of the act.
1 r-membe , too, that an eminent English judge is
said to have advned a íriend, about to enter upon
ine discnaige of j iriicial i'utie-, anil not very con-
fid ntofhi qualifications, to deed , but to give'
no reasons n supnon of h's op'iiions 1 was pre-
paid to en pea that the repeal of the Independent
Treasury law was a matter so well settled in the
m nds of the major'fy ot the Sena'e, that the pas-
sage cf this oil1, and net the reason? for its pas-
s?g?, wiihouf any provision tor a substitute, would
occupy their attention ind govern their action. Of
this I have n 1 right to comp'am, and do not com-
pla'n, and I refer to the fact simply to lay the foun-
dation for the ap Ugy I owe to the Senate for
ihr >■« uig vctj f'fnp ) 1 its attention, and occupying
it- time, s ) p'lmly aiairst the sense of a majority
of ihp bod}, and « hen I know that majority will
n it debate the question, will not advance argu-
in""is 'nía/ r of the pn^age °f trie bill, or reply
to ¡ho e adv^n^cd iT.mst it. It is painful forme
to sn p^: u ider °uc\ c rcumsHnce«, und under the
depp consciousness ot the i'ppa'iinee which must
be felt by those whose determira'ion is stmply to
