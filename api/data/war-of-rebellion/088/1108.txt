HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,September 29, 1864.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: The force mentioned on the south side of Hatcher's Run, where the telegraph road crosses it, is that of dismounted cavalry, as reported by prisoners captured; cavalry that have no horse at all. No line of intrenchment was seen about Miss Pegram's. Some cavalry still in my front and some firing on the Dinwiddie road toward Reams' Station, where I have a regiment.

Respectfully,

D. MCM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army.

The telegraph line on the road by Armstrong's was completed three or four days ago. Mr. Armstrong says that at times there is considerable wagoning of forage on the telegraph. The only wagon that passed to-day we captured; it belongs to a blockade-runner.

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: The enemy have attacked me in my front in considerable force. I think I will have no difficulty in repulsing the attack. The enemy use two pieces of artillery. One of my guns has been disabled.

Very respectfully,

The firing has died out somewhat. Send this by my orderly, so as to show the infantry brigade where to go.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,September 29, 1864-8 p. m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Just before dark the enemy made a very determined attack upon my line. All quiet now. The brigade of infantry has been ordered back to General Warren's position by General Griffin. I will hold the Wyatt road and Reams' Station road strongly, and get my command back to their horses near the railroad. In the affairs this evening my force engaged was entirely dismounted. The enemy showed very few horses, but still I think the attack was made by dismounted cavalry. I cannot give the number of my casualties, but I do not think it will be large. The enemy was very strong in my front and on my left flank.

Yours, respectfully,

D. MCM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
