Acting Paymaster-General, U. S. Army.

SURGEON-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

other claims of private physicians:

And in the hands of disbursing agents. 74,781.70

-------------

2,445,894.89

It has been usual for a report of the sickness and mortality of the Army to accompany this report; but it is found impracticable, arising from the vast amount of labor incident thereto, and will be furnished, it is believed, in time for publication as a 'supplement to the Surgeon-General's report for the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 1862," In the meantime, however, I am enabled to present the following statement of general hospitals and the number of patients, according to the latest returns received at this office.+

The number of general hospitals is thus seen to be 151, and the total number of patients in them 58,715.

During the past year the health of the troops has been remarkably excellent. No epidemics of any severity have appeared among them,
