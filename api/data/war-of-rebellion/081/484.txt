HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 28, 1864-7.45 p. m.

General POTTER:

The general commanding understood from you and Colonel Pleasants this morning that the gallery was extended 140 feet, and so reported it to headquarters. Major Cutting understood this afternoon that it was 130 feet at the time he was there. Will you be good enough to send word to the general how the matter stands.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,J. L. VAN BUREN,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 28, 1864-8 p. m.

Major J. L. VAN BUREN, Aide-de-Camp:

SIR: Colonel Pleasants reports that the gallery was 130 feet at 12 m. to-day by measurement. It was reported to me to be 130 feet about 9.30 a. m., which was the distance I stated to General Burnside this morning. That was, however, only estimated. The gallery was run fifty feet the first day and forty feet each day since, which rate of progression Colonel Pleasants thinks he will be able to maintain.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT B. POTTER,

Brigadier-General.

CITY POINT, June 28, 1864-1.20 p. m.

Colonel SHAFFER:

General Grant will be at home to-day. General Butler can see him at any time he desires.
