JOHN A. WILCOX,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, La., July 26, 1864.

Rear Admiral D. G. FARRAGUT,

Commanding West Gulf Squadron, off Mobile, Ala.:

ADMIRAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of yesterday. The troops will be ready to leave here at the same time the monitors do, and I will send them on sea going vessels, so as to conceal the destination as much as possible. I will send about 2,000 men, which will be sufficient to secure the occupation of Dauphin Island, and by the time that you are ready I will be able to send and additional force for operations about Fort Morgan. I see by the papers you send me that they are making every exertion in Mobile to be prepared for you and are trying to scare us off by demonstrations against our lines. Kirby Smith has been moving a large force down the Red River, I think with a view of crossing the Mississippi. He may, however, attempt to cross the Atchafalaya at Morgan's Ferry or Rose la Butte, at both of which places some demonstrations have been made within a few days. I am looking every day for about 3,000 troops from the coast of Texas, which will enable me to increase the force with you, if it should be necessary.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
