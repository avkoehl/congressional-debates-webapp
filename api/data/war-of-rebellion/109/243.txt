immediate attention and the suggestions of your telegram, and report will be communicated to him. Your reports are quite satisfactory. Two were received by mail to-day and submitted to the President. Great interest is felt in the operations of the West. Are Generals Halleck and Mitchel in communication with each other?

PITTSBURG LANDING, April 26, 1862.

(Received 7.45 p. M.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Line down yesterday, could not telegraph you. Rained all day, interfering greatly with movements. Clear and bright this morning. All matters progressing well. Information from deserters and prisoners render it reasonably certain that rebels are intrenching and massing forces at Corinth, and will make a decided stand. Our commanders hope they will, and are confident of results. General Halleck and General Mitchel are in communication by courier. A gun-boat was sent up to Florence, or above that, to aid General Mitchel if necessary.

THOS. A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War.

CHARLES ELLT, Jr.,

Pittsburg, Pa.:

We have certain intelligence that New Orleans has been captured-there appears to be no doubt of the fact. Commodore Farragut has orders to push up immediately to Memphis, and join Commodore Foote, without waiting at New Orleans. You should lose no time in starting your fleet to the same point. Our squadron was at New Orleans two days ago, Sunday, 8 p. M.*
