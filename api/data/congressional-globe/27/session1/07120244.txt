27th Cong.......1st Sess._____________________Tariff Bill—Mr. Hastings.___________________________________H. of Reps.
yoa Irish call it, do not let them be dividing ihe
proceeds of the publro lands, and then taxing Ub to
make up the difference in the revenue, and saying
it is enriching lis; I don't believe it --.You know
what the farmers want; they want no advantages,
and tiwy will give none; they want to be let alone,
not to be enir&mmelled and tormented by unne-
cessary, and impolitic, and partial interferences
and enactment .; we have had too much of it airea
dy, and it is high time it should be stopped, and if
the farmers were all of my mind, which they
soon will be, they would soon stop it Your idea
of equalizing the duties on imports, not making
fish of one and flesh of another, is a just one, and
the only one that all interests would be any thing
like satisfied with—it is plain sailing, -nd we will
support you in it. We do not want you to get
your blood up and fight, but we want you to «ee
fair play as well as you can; remember that."
Now, sir, I agree with my neighbor entirely m this
matter. I am opposed to all partial legislation an i
interference with the industrial interest and con-
cerns of the Union; they are too multifarious and
intricate in their details, and bearing'!, and com-
binations, to be analyzed and unuetstood and di-
rected by us; their relations to each o her are too
undefined, too delicate, to bj tampered with by
the people's representatives As my constituent
means, let us just let them alone, let the action of
Government be seen and felt -.imply n the per-
fectly impartial exercise of the powi is delegated
to it, not in partial legislation Yes, as my iarmer
friend rightly conceives, Ian oppobed to ihe
whole ot the*e exdediency legulation scheme , to
the scheme of repealing the Independent Treasury,
which separated Bank and State, to the sche-t e of
dividing the proceeds of the pjbhc domain among
the States, and reimbursing the Treasury by in-
creased taxation on the people, through increased
duties on imports, to a discriminating protective
tariff scheme, to a Na wnal Bank fiscal agency
scheme, and to all ihe minor schemi  ibatwill be
brought into operation to inflict the major schemes
upon the people
I must confess that I am somewhat surprised to
hear gentlemen, both here and in the other end of
the Capitol, calling silks and wines luxuries- it
is surely misapplied to many articles at the pre-
sent day, and rather difficult to define precisely.
But I would not speak ot it, if it hid not some
bearing on the question of revenue It would
seem to indicite that they, and all else that may be
chosen, whether through inconnderateness, ci
price,or what not, to be icrmcd "luxuries " should
be particular objects ol heavier impost than othe s
They may have fallen aithin dip cNss ot ¡u<u-
rtes once, but do they come vnhin it no > ? Wiy,
Mr, t'iere is hardly a female—log-cabiu yrl, it you
will—in my neighborhood thai has n t a silk gosvn
and why should bhe not? It is true, she does not
make money out ot paper to buy it with, "ihe doe
not study any scheme to trick it out i f the Kb r
of otherb—that amiable species of refinement, of
chicanery in political economy, has no' eattred
into the unsophisticated imaginations of tie in
mates of real log-cabm^ No, sir, the daugnter of
he log-cabin plants and hoes corn, mak s h<ii, and
spin^, and dies, and weaves, and earns ? si k
gown by her industry, and he bn ther, if 1-e
chooses, wears a silk waistcoat thrr « >i the same
means. And why should he nut, if I e fancies it ">
But there may be serious objections u) this ol 1
fashioned means of obtaining dre^s by inJu>trj,
it nay be 1  bad ta te, it is not the rage of the
day, it is not in accordanc  with fashionable specu-
lation; it may be con-idered an inroad ormfrusior-
npon the magical sphere of idleness I call it ma-
gical, for how otherwise can we account for the re-
spect it engages, and the influence it it diets on so
ciety') Ay, and when the rosy-cheektd maiden of
the log-cabin exchanges it, through the labors of
its inmates, for the frame, or brick, or *ioi' hruse,
she does not «corn the same m^ans o ge'tmg ihe
silk dress, or any other art e'e that takes her fan
cy;she pursues the same course of indjstry as she
did m th° log-cabm And why? Fr >m a right
sense of "the glorious privilege of being mdepen
dent," as some poet—the Ayrsh re ploughman,
T believe—.feas it.   Ah, Mr, Chairman, thes? are
the girls that make the wives, that give us the bone,
and muscl , aid sinew of our coun'ry. And as to
wine: why don't we call eider a luxur;1* the pro-
cess of making it is similar, and we might have
grapes as plenty as apples A pTSon^would be
laughed at in a wine country for (Mling wine
a luxury As to tha fashionable champaign,
it is well known that three-fourths of n
is a luxury, compounded from cider, green
gooseberries, and turnip juice, flavored with
diugs. i'ea, coffee, and spices, are now
necessaries. The truth is, a freeman of the
United States will just use as much of these, or
any thing else, as he chooses to acquire by honest
mdustrv, and wealth will use them loo, whether
acquired by this same honest industry, or by spe-
cial privilege and its voracious concomitant, mono
poly
But the day will arrive when we will import
neither wines nor silks—when they will be as
mpch staples of the South as cotton is at present
In the statistics of the United Stales for 1840, I
ptieeive 328,482 pounds o( silk cocoon-;, and
316 626 gallons of wine—161,844 gallons of the
latter made in Ohio. Yes, sir, and the day vtill
arrive when w will import neither linens, nor
cloths, nor blankets, not tuffs, nor glass, nor haic'-
ware If we . re tine to ourselvc, this wi'l mevi
lably be the case, we will make them all—ítcxnnot
be otherwise The day will amis when the
South, if she will only use the advantages her
climate gives her, will be the garden of the Union
Dr Perune showed that the most valuable medi-
cinal plants would thru e in Florida, and ihe green
ta plant flourish in Georgia Le tie South only
roisc up her eneigies, and in due time we will be
independent of China for tea, and of Portugal for
cirb—for the cork-tree will thrive well in the
South Yes, sir, let the sunny South only get into
determined, persevering action—tutn her chival-
ry to some profiiabie acexunt—and the high desti-
By awaits her A farmer should not buy an arti-
cle that he can raibe on h s tarm, and the United
States should not purchase a product that she ean
raise in her soil But, as I said before, to enjoy
all her advantages, the South must get into enerse-
tic actmn—not talk, talk, but act, act What need
we care for the old world's p lry crdisjgns, if
we ar- only true to ourselves?
If ne wish to thrive, and enjov the ei t re a''-
vantapes tpat Gou and nature have giv~n u , a id
svstain the Union in he true, s¡.irn, at' 1 live in
harmony, we mu t, among other lelormauon,
equ il 70 the import duaes impartially, and confine
iV revenue, including the pr ceeds et tne public
I in Is, to the expenses of the Government In re
1 ion to this list item, although he b II for t le
I tiibuu n of these proejéis ha  passed this
House, I am in hopes it will n t pass 'be Senate,
and if it should, I am still m hopes it -nil! be ar-
reted by the wi dom and patr ovi  f ihe Presi-
dent, for it appears to mv mind—out of re'pest to
ihe msjon y tha suppor s it, I will not say nefa
nous—or<e of the most deleterious m % ares, to the
indep ndence and integrity and p 111 cal morality
of the Union, that has ever been projected it leads
to consolidation and central zation Bat, as I was
saying, as well as mpaitialij equali7rg the mi-
port dntios, we >r>ust give up 'he the whole of our
spec al privilege and immunity and vested rights,
anlbiuntyanl protective tariff schemes, which
give sop e S ales and some jiople undue advan-
tage  at tiie expense of the others, and recur to
p'?m ailng We must cea«e to extract cocie y,
and to oppress and unrefulate industry and trade
through the embarrassing, partial, and we mieht
ssy, surreptitious operations of th's tormous, d>s-
tracting p diet, l^avirg industrial pursuits of all
kinds, and ct mnerce, and genius, and talent, anl
ingenuity, and merit, 'o find their true level and
just reward through their own free effort. And,
as involving this, we mint support the Constitu-
tion in spirit and sincerity, by construing it sir ctly,
leaving not a particle to implication, nor insulting
it* puwy through the pretext ot expediency, keep-
ing ¡he action of the General Government rigidly
within its herns, ever revering the sacred equal
rights of the people and the States as the bulwark
oí our univP, mdependencs and prosperity,
Any special encouragement given to a particu-
lar branch or branches ot industry is unjust towards
the others, and is unwi«e polic); for it disturbs the
equilibrium, the level that belongs to the whole;
inducing a withdrawal of capital and attention
from others to the favored one. People will natu-
rally follow whatever pursuit appears the most
profitable; and, if Government will only let the
business of life alone, it will regulate itself through
its own natural action. No; the beneficence of
Goiernment consists, simply, in equal attention to
all. Whenever it confers special privilege, or ad-
vantage, or protection, it is. going out of ihe line of
its duty, legislating unjustly, by invading the all
pervading principle of freedom—equal right*. We
know the common argument is, that we perpetrate
these act1  ef arbitrary expediency, or rather specu-
lative injustice, tcr the good of the whole, How
can that be? If we add to a part, must it not be
abstracted from the whole? If one atom is en-
larged, must not other  be lts'enec' If wa give a
bounty or gratuity to one branch of industry, must
it not be at the expense of the othei branches, d  it
m what form we may' te it for finite man to as-
sume thi* power of exercising speculative injustice
upon the whole of his fel'ow-men, under the plea
of it  being for the good of the whole—for the ge-
neral welfare? Are not the results of speculation
g iverned by contingencies? Torture the Constitu-
tion as we may, w  cannot do such aets to bear the
test o' light
Direct taxes being cf a more or le s inquisitorial
character in their eTactiot\ the peopie ean under-
stand and gaard  gatn« an mordí late infliction
< f them, but indirect Uxrs, such a  dunes on ím
port , ate less easily understood in their bearings on
trie industrial in erests of the country, iftid should,
therefore, be jealousy watched, ar.d stuphfied in
polity, and not suffered to extend beyond the ex-
penses of the Govern me nt, and confined to impartial
action—the interference, however plausibly expe-
dieit, on the industrial interests and pursuits of
the community, leaving, as I said before, genius,
talent, ingenuity, labor, and every species of in-
dustry, t find their natural level, their own ad-
vantage, and their fair rewarl, and merit to em-
blazon and adorn ít^el as u may deserve Gentle-
men Mil easili perceive bow partial laws—of in-
direct t&xa'ion amorg ihe res'—interfere at every
step with the equitable provision-  of the Constitu-

protection and support to the peop'e in their indus-

I bdvc ■•aid, M . Cnairman, that in examining
ihe detai's of th a bill for the revision of trr tariff,
I sVu'd do it chiefly in reia'ion to its effects upon
the equal rights of he people, and I intend to do
SB But I must premise, that, not supposing so
l-nportjnt a measure would have b<=en placed be-
fore us earlier than the regular ses*un in Decem-
ber, nor that it wi uld hate been carried through
the House sj rapidly as to preclude the uninterrupt-
ed deliberation that so seneus a s*jjnet as taxation
demands, I am not preja ed to analjze and mea-
sure lis merits as particularly as miiht seem neces-
sary However, as I put myself upon the pi.in,
unernrg, broad ground o' equality in taxation, di-
rectoi indirect,  nd t^at th  people's equal rights,
and the Constttufon, and the harmony ot the
Union tluough, lt^p rttal taxation, imperiously de-
mandan every act of ¡egi<>ation,an eni re,unquali-
' ed regard for th s democ-at e, fundamental princi-
ple of tree go/umnent—equ«) righ's, I offer to the
House a simple, plain ptoposition, arising out jf
the subject ot this btl'—and tnat is that t'ie import
rJutte  upon all products that we can raise in our
=oi\ and upon all fabrics that we can manufacture,
should be of one ad valorem denomination—of
sucha per centage as vould, together with the
proceeds of the public lands, pay the expenses of
the Government ¿m\ no more, that products
whicw our climate ui 1 not permit us to raise,
should cime in duty free, that the duties should be
paid m cash down, and that gold and silver, and
the fish bounty laws repealed
As to brandies, gins, and íums, they are neither
products nor fabrics, and there will be no objec-
