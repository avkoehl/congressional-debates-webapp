Independent Treasury—Mr. Pickens.
H. of Reps.
coveiy, left for modem invention There never
was a community, constituted under political
no icr, which wou'd not finally, in the progress oí
time, classify itself into capitalists and laborers,
and tha' which may be a blessing to one may be a
curse to the other With a view that we may un-
derstand that there is a difference in the interests of
son e m the community, and w ith no other view at
present, let us look at the operation of the banking
system on this country m reference alone to the
expense of the currency it furnishes Calculate
circulation as it was m January, 1837, at
$ 148,000 000, and then add to that the $72,000,000
specie lying m vault to sustain this circulation, and
upin which inteifst must be male by those who
keep it, so as <.o indemnify them for its use in this
agency. And then we have, upon adding them
together, ^220,000,000 upon which the interest
wi'l be §15,400,000 annually This is equal to
the wnole tobacco crop of the United States Who
receives this interest—laborers or capi'ahsts ¡n bank
stock' And this is but a small item in the amount
of their profits and dividends. Banks, too, in mo-
dern times cl um an identity with the people, as if
the} were one and the same No wonder, then,
that we he->r there are ro capitalists, no laborers—
tint all s"ctions are the same, and all classes the
sare
Aw un,*wl lie on this point, let us look for a mo-
ment at the peculiar operation of this bank cm-
rency upon those who depend upon daily labor, and
s>eit there be no difference of interest When
banks furnish thecuculation of acountry, they un-
questionably have the power to expand and to con-
tract that circulation according to their views of
interest or policy Suppose, then, prices to settle
down under a >-tate of contraction, and then ex-
pansi m commences to take piare What do we
ee? Stocks go up, personal property rises, real
estate rise , and wage? for daily labor are the last
to rise The desire of the industrious is to lay out
a 1, over -nd above what is necessary for supplies,
in property. How can this be done when trages
are at a snnd and property rising, under in ex-
panding currency thrown out by banks, and sti-
mulated to enlarge, as they have been heretofore,
by Government deportes
Sir, it is th s desolating opeiation of expansion
and contraclioi which unngs pioduc ive industry
■u toe meicy of ficti ious cap tal, and it is all va n
to tell me mere i> no difference It is a stable gold
and silver currency under which labor flourishes,
an I throjgh which it can calculate with certainty,
as to the acquisition of property, and it is a paper
expan led currency on wmch speculator flourish
and revel in spoils plundered from others
No difference between labor and capital''' Go,
m the depth of wintei, to the frozen banks of the
Miami, or the deep forests of the Miss $sippi, and
ask the hardy pioneer if there be no difference Lc-
tween his lot and that of the princely specnlat r,
who carves out for himself a barony from )our
--p'endid domain     Ah' sir, go into the bacic streets
id alleys of your large cities, and ask tne tenants
[ t dwall in then thousand hovels, if theie be no
d fference m then lot and tho^e who live under tne
drippings from the palaces wh.ch have sprang up
like ii^gic throughout ourla"d to give us the bltss
m„s of an expinded paper currency' Perhaps, sir,
If you were 10 pause foi a rep'f, you might
hear some oí e exclaim, v\ the bitter anguish
of a desponding h=art, Merciful God, is this
(he equal justice ol a free country1 Th" doc-
trine, that ail classes m sonety aie mum illy
depenlent upon each othfr, and benefit) to
one cl iss are benefits to p-iother, is utterly miUue,
<■ id the legislator who habi'Uc. 1> acts upon such an
idea perpe ía'es cold, heartier, cruel injustice
Tbvt is the very doctrine by which the aristocracy
of the old world claim to besipported Those
w ho vindicated an established clergy, do so upon
the avowed ground that it sheds correspond ng
blessings upon all otber classes in society By the
same sort of plausibil ty a nation may be de uded
into the suppoitof the stars and the diadems of
royalty Sir, the profound truth is that there are
conflicts in all communities, and that the Govern-
ment is the wisesi and the freest which abstain 
from creating any artificial class who expect to live
by its favor or flourish upon tU bounty Wot only
are there different classes m society, differently af-
fected, but in this extensive country, Aere are
different sections deeply and vitally affected, in
different ways, by the fiscal action of this Govern-
ment Look over that balmy land that expands its
exuberant bosom under the genial rays of the
southern sun, with i s rich exports, amounting, in
some years, to near ^100,000,000, and what do we
see' Much of this vast product actually taken to
northern ports, and again reshipped, while three-
four hs of the returnme imports upon this amount
are brought back again through the same circui-
tous direction Is this a natural operation' No
It arises, in a great degree, fro n the fiscal action
of this Government Your impost system operates
so as to collect, indirectly, two-thirds of your re-
venues from the expoitsof the countiy, and the
same interests which have formed this system, also
have the power to control the disbursements The
result of which has been to collect two-thirds of the
revenue from the expotttng interest, and to dis-
butse the same amount in the non-exporting region
This it is that has made your towns and your
cities languish and die in one section, while they
have sprung up and flourished, to the astonishment
and admiration of the world, n another section
Connected w ith this subject, a'so, it is a view
worthy of notice, that about three-fourths of the
pap°r credits of the country have heietofore issued,
also, from the non-exporting region Thes 2 cre-
dits have circulated as money, and, ever since
Hamilton's Treasury order in 1789, the whole
power and patronage of the Federal Government
have been devoted, in its nscal action, to give that
circulation the profits and attributes of gold and
silver currency This operation has grven those
who issued these credits precisely the same power
over the pioductive industry and labor of the coun
try, as if they had actually held that much capital
in gold and silver The great struggle now is,
whether those exports which have an mtimsieva
lue at home and abroad, shall form the basis of a
sound system of credits and exchanges, or whether
banks of discount and circulation, aided by, and
allied to, the political power of the commumtv,
shall produce an artificial and unsound system'
Let us look foi a moment into this artificial sys-
tem We find at present a shock in the whole
trade and eXcnanges of the countrj, and in the
shock those who hold the piper circulation control
the propertj and the products of the nation Ex-
change^ have changed their whole nature They
used to be considered the diffeience between cash
anda bill drawn for payment on some distant
point But now it is the d /Terence between paper
circulation at one point, an 1111 value in the paper
circulation of some other point The creditor point
contracts, and the debtor point remains stationary,
or enlarges, and of course exchanges rise The
paper circulation, for instance, in Mississippi, may
be thirty per cent below specie par there, because
of its inconvertible}, and from different circum-
stances in New Y01 k, papei ma/ be at specie par,
o', by way ot illu tration, fiie pel cent Delow spe-
cie par The difierencc is then Uveny-five per
ccn' be* ween thj capacity of convening the circu-
lation 11 Mississippi mto legal curiency, and the
capacity to do the same with the circuí¡tion mNew
York Now, ai<= ue by any bojnty or power of
ours to make it the interest of ISew York to receive
that at only five per cent belcw specie par which,
from want of convertibility, is thirty per cent be-
low par at home' Yet tris is exacdy what is re-
quired from the Government m what is now called
equalizing exchanges There never was greater
fraud conceited than lb s oper tion h is no 1 ing
more nor less than a bounty to the banking interest
at the expense of the pn ducmg interest of the com-
munity The only luie and legitimite basis of ex-
changes is (he trade between different points. Give
the banking interest the privilege and power of
having the circulation of then credit received and
treated as cash or money, and you at once give it
the direction and monopoly of ttade Give them
the power of discounting upon the public funds as
up n specie, together with the certainty that the
commerce of the countiy ohall flow indirectly
through their hands, both going and coming, and
well may they afford to equalize exchanges, by in-
demnifying themselves through the tribute they
levy upon the productive industry of the country.
Sir, it is this whole system, allied as it has been
with the over fiscal action of this centralizing Go-
vernment, that has tended to monopolize trade, and
force the exports, as well as the imports, through
great Northern cutes, at the expense of all that sec-
tion which lies South and West of this place. And
the great pressure which has been felt principally
m the Northern cities, arises, in a great degree,
from the fact that, heretofore, they have received
an unnatural and inflated impuKe from the vast
surpluses in (he Treasury, and from their discounts
running upon the revenues of the Government, for
the benefit of dividends to private stockholders
When this unnatural and unjust state of things 1?
withdiawn, we begin to see trade, like water, find-
ing its natural level, and in receding, it is not
strange that many -should be left to straggle who
have been heretofore sustained by the flood tide
from an overflowing public Treasury Things will
now become sounder and «afer, and if you do not
see such rapid increase, you will see more honesty
and stability, and the landed interests will be bless-
ed, although stock-jobbers and speculators may
suffer
Upon this point, Mr Chairman, it strikes me
that no part of the country has more interest than
the interior West Their operations are peculiar
Their largest single interest is their live stock and
provision trade. The most profitable part of that
commerce is their cash sales m the exporting re-
gion It is this which gives them their greatest ca-
pacity to purchase elsewhere. Around this interest
all others rally. The natural course of ail trade is
to buy whereyou sell; but under existing trade,
they do not feuy where they make their grea'e^t
cash sales, and, consequently, ¡hey have doub a
exchanges to encounter
The merchants of the West have been, for the
most-part, from the East, with Eastern credi s, and
have given their purchases that direction, at <l1
expense of the provision producing interest Th s
artificial system, fostered, as it has been, by the ac-
tion of this Government, all ed with those who
hold the credit circulation, has raised embank-
ments, and forced their trade into unnatural chan-
nels It is their cash sales into the staple or ex-
porting States which gives them their highest pro -
penty That sy stem which benefits or injures the
former, indirectly produces corresponding effects
upon them As cotton rises, all their cash pro-
duce rises also If, matead of selling their stock
¡n one market and buying goods m another, they
were to buy and sell in the same region, they
would save at least one operation m exchanges.
And the resalt of this would be, that the circula-
tion where they made their sales would not only
serve their purposes, but would be actually at a pre-
mium. And the only reason why this is not the
fact now, is from the indebtedness of then mer-
chants, who trade where the farming interests do
not sell This would be reversed, if it had not
b°en for the artificial aid afforded by Government
m its fiscal action, to the banking interests, at the
expense of the agricultural Th  prest-nt nemmJ
rate of domestic exchanges ¡s not the sli"htest evi-
dence of what ought to exist under a sound and
heaithy state of trade. The toleration extended by
die public to the suspensi m of specie pay ments,
together with the large debtor interest now in so-
ciety, gives the banks the compVe po ver of fhe
country, and makes it their m'crest, m many in-
stances, to deprecióte ihcir ownbill  Many make
out of exchanges their chief profits Exchange
now is only the difference m paper crculution at
different points If those who rav-e the pioduce
vi ou'd only act in concert, they could command
and control proper exchanges There isnopait
of the world, the course of whose trade is more un-
natural than the West at present It had its con-
summation in their suicidal alliance with the pro-
tective and tariff interests of th" country, and has
never yet rghted itself Th ngs will now change,
and they will find it eminently their interest here-
after, as it has been with all other sections, to pur-
chase where they make their largest cash sales
