WAR DEPARTMENT,

August 13, 1862.

Governor MORTON,

Indianapolis:

Three additional officers for mustering and disbursing have been sent to your State. Young lieutenants are better than old officers who are incapable of duty. The Department will furnish the best material it can, but without any hope of preventing complaints or avoiding dissatisfaction. Funds have been provided and sent to your State.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

General C. P. BUCKINGHAM:

We have now enrolled, as near as we can tell, 24,000 men under call of July 2. By Saturday morning will have several thousand more. I have no doubt I shall be able to make two regiments in all districts where only one was called for complete on the 15th instant.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Your dispatch of this date is received. I regret that suggestions respectfully made in relation to the wants and conditions of the public service in Indiana should be regarded in the light of complaints and dissatisfaction. I give you credit for doing what you can for the cause, and claim the same for myself in my limited position. If the Government understands the condition of affairs in Indiana, of course information from me is not required.
