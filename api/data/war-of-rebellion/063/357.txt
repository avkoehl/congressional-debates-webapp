Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

My dispatch to you of 6 p.m. yesterday answers the questions asked in your letter of the 29th, just received, except as to extent of the trans-Mississippi division. I would not have it include Pope's department, but would have it include Rosecrans' and Curtis'. An entire failure of the Banks expedition may make operations requiring an increase of force necessary in either of those departments. You see from my dispatch I do not propose removing General Banks, but would not increase his command. If you could not go to take temporary command until present difficulties are cleared up, I think General Steele would be the best man, and General Reynolds to take his place. The great objection to this is taking General Steele from where he is at this time.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, April 30, 1864-3.15 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Culpeper, Va.:

As some time may elapse before trans-Mississippi affairs are definitely decided upon, had I not better telegraph to Cairo and Little Rock, modifying my telegram of the 27th, to the effect that no troops will be withdrawn from the operations against Shreveport and on Red River, and that those operations will be continued under the direction of the senior officer in command in the field until further orders? It appears that Major-General Hurlbut claims that Special Orders, Numbers 150, War Department, do not relieve him from command of the Sixteenth Army Corps, and that he is still exercising command over General Washburn. Shall I not telegraph him that he is relieved from all command, and will repair to his home in Illinois?

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

CULPEPER, VA., April 30, 1864-6.30 p.m.

(Received 6.50 p.m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Your suggestion to modify orders for troops on Red River so as to leave them to operate there until something definite is settled upon, I think advisable. Please send the order. I wanted General Hurlbut relieved entirely from all connection with the Sixteenth Corps.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
