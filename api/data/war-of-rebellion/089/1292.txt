HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,December 22, 1864.

OFFICER COMMANDING RODES' DIVISION:

Lieutenant-General Longstreet directs that you halt your command on Proctor's Creek, between Drewry's Bluff and the railroad. You will select a position as much concealed as possible from the view of the enemy. You will report the whereabouts of your camp to Major-General Pickett and to these headquarters.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,December 22, 1864.

Major-General PICKETT,

Commanding Division:

You will immediately relieve Hunton's brigade and order it to cook three days' rations, and prepare for a trip of a week. Send an officer to halt Rodes' division, which is moving across to the pontoon bridge over the James, and order it to camp on Proctor's Creek, between the railroad and Drewry's Bluff, in the most concealable place they can find. Please acknowledge receipt of this.

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,December 22, 1864-6 p. m.

Major-General PICKETT:

General Hunton will march as soon as he can get his rations cooked to the Central railroad depot, in Richmond, where transportation will be in readiness to take him to Gordonsville. General Bratton's brigade, of Field's [division], is also going to the same place, and will probably get off before Hunton's. On reaching Gordonsville General Hunton will take command of all the troops he may find there. The enemy, with about 4,000 cavalry and four pieces of artillery, are supposed do be making for Gordonsville. General Hunton will hold the Place, and if circumstances admit will operate against them by pursuing or attacking. The troops will be gone about a week, and will leave guards in charge of property left behind in camp. Notify me when Hunton will reach Richmond. The greatest expedition is necessary. You can use part of Rodes' division to hold the line Colonel Mayo is now holding. Acknowledge receipt of this.

O. LAFTROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
