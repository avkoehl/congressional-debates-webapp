the enemy attacked my advanced picket on the Richmond road. They took advantage of the dense fog, and approached very near before being in disorder. They left a wounded prisoner on the ground, who states that their force consisted of 300 men, of the Twenty-third North Carolina Regiment. We lost 1 officer and 1 private killed, an 2 enlisted men wounded. The officer killed (Major John E. Kelley, of the Ninety-sixth New York Volunteers, who commanded the pickets) is a great loss to the service. I knew him well when orderly-sergeant of the Second Infantry. I have inclosed a list of the killed and wounded. Captain George W. Gillespie, of the One hundred and third Pennsylvania Volunteers, who commanded the pickets after the death of Major Kelley, behaved very well.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
