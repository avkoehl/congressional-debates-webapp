MOUNT JACKSON, September 23, 1864. (Via Harrisonburg 4 a.m.)

Late yesterday the enemy attacked my position at Fisher's Hill and succeeded in driving back the left of my line, which was defended by the cavalry, and throwing a force into the rear of the left of my infantry line, when the whole of the troops gave way in a panic and could not be rallied. This resulted in a loss of twelve pieces of artillery, though my loss in men is not large. I am falling back to New Market, and shall endeavor to check the enemy if he advances. Kershaw's division had better be sent to my aid, through Swift Run Gap, at once.

J. A. EARLY.

HEADQUARTERS, September 23, 1864.

Respectfully submitted for information of Secretary of War.

Kershaw's division, with battalion of infantry, has been ordered to re-enforce Early, and he has been directed to call out all the troops in the Valley. I have no other troops to send.

R. E. LEE,General.

PORT REPUBLIC, September 25, 1864.

GENERAL: I had determined to write you a full account of recent events, but I am too much occupied to do so. In the fight at Winchester I drove back the enemy's infantry, and would have defeated that, but his cavalry broke mine on the left flank, the latter making no stand, and I had to take a division to stop the progress of the former and save my trains, and during the fighting in the rear the enemy again
