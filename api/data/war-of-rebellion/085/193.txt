SAINT LOUIS, September 14, 1864.

Brigadier-General FISK, Saint Joseph, Mo.:

The general commanding directs me to say that while he considers Van Horn's claims very favorably, he does not wish them to interfere with De Bolt's regiment. If they can combine for the best, well and good. He desires to know how soon De Bolt's regiment can be got up.

SAINT LOUIS, September 14, 1864.

General FISK:

The general commanding is in receipt of a telegram from General Douglass stating that his movements have been delayed three days for want of rations. The general desires you to explain this, as twenty-four hours could have carried rations to him from either direction. The general directs me to say that with this present light he is surprised at such a telegram.

O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

SAINT JOSEPH, MO., September 14, 1864.

Colonel O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

In reply to General Douglass' statement that he could get no rations, I have only to say that the want of them was not made known to me. Had the want been made known I should certainly have supplied it.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

MEXICO, MO., September 14, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

General Fisk directed me to take charge of the movements of the troops in my district. I was out on a scout in Boone and Howard at the time. Found in Boone about 250, in Howard 200, in Randolph say 200. They are in bands of from 20 to 100. Anderson is yet in Boone and Howard Counties. I find it impossible to move secretly without rations. Have been waiting here three days for rations. Will move immediately with infantry and cavalry from here on their arrival, carrying rations in haversacks. With forces now at my command I am confident that in ten days I will drive and scatter all their force. Some, I learn, are now disbanding and trying to save themselves by flight.

J. B. DOUGLASS,

Brigadier-General.
