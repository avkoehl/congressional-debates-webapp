SPANISH FORT, April 1, 1865-9.30 p. m.

Major-General MAURY:

General Liddell was of the opinion a few days ago that the force at this place could not be reduced. It has been reduced 400 muskets by the exchange of Holtzclaw's for Thomas' brigade. Both General Holtzclaw and myself are of the opinion that the place cannot be held, with the small force left after the withdrawal of Ector's brigade, against the heavy force pressing upon us at every point. You can depend upon my zeal and renewed determination to do my very best to hold the place.

R. L. GIBSON,

Brigadier-General.

General MAURY,

Mobile:

The following dispatch just received from General Gibson:

In the opinion of General Holtzclaw and myself, the withdrawal of Ector's brigade renders Spanish Fort untenable with the small force now pressing at every point. While this is my candid conviction, I will continue heartily and with renewed efforts to do my utmost to hold this place.

R. L. GIBSON,

Brigadier-General.

Please decide this matter at once. The boats have gone to Spanish Fort.
