THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 16,
port extravagant and unnecessary expendi-
tures is wrong. Is it not equally wrong to levy
and collect taxes for the support of objects
outside of the purposes for which Government
was organized, and'in doing so that you must
exercise powers not delegated to you? Must
the Government take care of man? Is it
One of the objects of Government to take
from one of its citizens to his impoverishment
that which Riven to another of its citizens
enriches hirti?
The answer to these questions involve the
whole theory and difference between the reve-
nue reformers upon the one hand and the pro-
tectionists upon the other. The revenue re-
former, insisting that no more tax shall be
levied and collected from the labor of the
country than is required to meet the neces-
sary and legitimate expenditures of the Gov-
ernment, and that in its assessment this is the
sole object that can be rightfully, justly, and
constitutionally regarded, and should bear
upon all citizens and industries with equality
and uniformity, aud entertaining these views,
is for a change aud modification of the present
tariff, which is essentially in conflict with these
opinions; whilethe protectionist maintains that
we rightfully have the powerto levy and collect
taxes for the support of the Government, yet
that in its assessments it may be so adjusted as
to promote and protect certain special pursuits
and industries, or, in other words, promote
the interests of special, and thereby favored
classes, by interrupting and changing the
natural channels of trade and commerce—
alleging that it is for "the common good"
and for '"the general welfare" of the whole
people. *
I think, Mr. Chairman, I have fairly stated
the issue between the respective parties. I
most heartily sympathize and cooperate with
those who seek to reduce and reform our pres-
ent system of taxation, and, as I have here-
tofore during this session, will now, when I
cannot get what I would have, take what I can
get, and by all the means at my command
labor to take off and reduce the heavy taxa-
tion now resting like an incubus upon the
people of the United States, whether that
reduction is to be obtained by piece-meal or by
wholesale ; and I respectfully deny the the-
ories and principles of those who labor to fos-
ter special pursuits and favored classes, the
tendency of which theories is to build up and
perpetuate monopolies by a system of boun-
ties to be derived by partial legislation from
the great agricultural and producing inter-
ests of the country. Am I correct in this
charge ?

And as you look upon that picture and see
who are the favored pensioners of the coun-
try, and then upon this, an exhibit of the
wealth and poverty of the States as shown in
the census returns for 1870 in the tables pre-
pared by the Superintendent of the Census
Bureau, and see that those who have take
from those who have not, you should not be
surprised at the complaints of the people. Here
it is:

As the gentleman from Illinois pithily and
truthfully remarks :
" Compare these tables and observe the accumu-
lation of wealth in manufacturing States like Mas-
sachusetts, lthode Island, Connecticut, Pennsyl-
vania, and New Jersey, and it is not difficult to
comprehend wliero the bencfitsof tariff bounties are
received."
But even this picture does not fully present
the measure of injustice done the agricultural
laborer and the great mass of the people, as
it will at once be observed that iron, steel,
and leather, salt, and other articles, whose
manufacturers are equally favored by bounties
and pensions under the name of protection,
are not mentioned. The picture has been
grouped by my friend from Kentucky, [Mr.
Kbad.] Ho says:
Salt $1,170,587 37 *$3.300,000
Iron and steel    20,530,000 00 87 004,050
Leather, hidcs.skins, &c. 5,200,000 00 30,000,000
Cotton goods 10,773.832 00 6iJ.700.000
AVoolen goods..   33.539,475 93 110,680,000
Total $71,210.895 30 $315,744.050
"It will bo seen by tbo foregoing1 table that in
order to get into tbo Treasury the sum of $71,219,-
895 30 the people have to pay the sum of $386.9b3,-
945 30j and $315,744,050 of that Amount goes into tho
coffers of the manufacturers. Tho heart turns sick
and faint as you look upon the scene of wrong and
oppression laid upon tho poor laboring man and
woman of tho country by the party in power.
441 am sustained in the estimate and calculations
that I have made as to tho busis upon which tho
people pay, and tho amount they pay, by cx-A^sist-
aot Treasurer Clark, who a short tune alter ho went
out ol ofiiec, at the close of Johnson's administra-
tion, wrote a letter in which he says that we paid
upon a basis of about nine hundred million dollars.
The following is an extract from his letter:
44 4 It can bo clearly demonstrated that frauds and
evasions are practiced to such an extent that not
more than one half of the amount is collected that
should and would be if the laws were enforced with
administrative ability and integrity. The result is
that the honest tax-payers are now paying upon a
basis of revenue of about nine hundred million dol-
lars per annum, while not more than one half of
that sum finds its way into the Treasury.' "
And now, sir, as you bear in mind, these very
gross and oppressive burdens, imposed by the
tariff upon the laboring men and laboring
women of this country, and the great injus-
tice (involving a violation of the Constitution
in the want of uniformity and equality) done
to the great majority of the people, who, are
doubly taxed, iirst, for revenue, secondly,
for the favored classes, the monopolists, I ask
you to look at the workings of jour internal
revenue system. That great engine of fraud,
robbery, and demoralization, which in it's oner-
