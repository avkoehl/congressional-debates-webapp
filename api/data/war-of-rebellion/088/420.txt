FORT POWHATAN, August 23, 1864-2.15 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

I think with you it would be imprudent to send General Miles with his small force beyond the support of the main army to destroy the railroad. If we can hold our present position until the roads get in good order, Ord can be sent with the Eighteenth Corps and cavalry to complete the work if possible as far as Hicksford, at least so far as to inconvenience the enemy in hauling around the break, and so that it would take considerable time to repair it.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

General GRANT:

I have examined the line from the Strong house to Warren's right. It can be held securely by two divisions of the Ninth Corps, leaving two divisions in reserve. Warren can hold his line securely with three divisions, leaving him one in reserve. Under these circumstances, as Miles has had a skirmish with the enemy's cavalry, and from prisoners learned that a division of cavalry was in his front, I have ordered Gibbon down to Reams' Station and sent Hancock down to take charge of the two divisions of infantry and the railroad as far as practicable.
