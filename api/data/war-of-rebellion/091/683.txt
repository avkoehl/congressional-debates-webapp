CITY POINT, VA., November 28, 1864-5.30 p. m.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Kernstown, Va.:

My impression now is that you can spare the Sixth Corps with impunity. I do not want to make the order for it imperative; but unless you are satisfied that it is necessary for the defense of the Valley I would like to get it here as early as possible. I do not care particularly for the artillery belonging to the corps, but the infantry alone, and wagon trains to follow.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

KERNSTOWN, November 28, 1864-8 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I send the Sixth Corps to you by division, with intervals of one day, commencing on the 30th. They can be shipped from Stephenson's Depot, four and a half miles from Winchester, by railroad to Washington.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

It is reported to me that two brigades of the enemy's cavalry captured New Creek to-day. I have ordered troops from Martinsburg to Cumberland, and a division of cavalry to Moorefield. Merritt's division of cavalry goes to the east of Blue Ridge to-day, and will clear out Loudoun Country Manassas Gap Railroad to the Potomac. It is reported to me that Gordon's division, of Early's army, is moving to Richmond. Ask General Grant if there is anything to confirm this report.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
