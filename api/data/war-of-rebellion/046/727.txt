The enemy-with some of his boats disabled by hand-grenades and masses of masonry (convenient weapons to the ready hands of our garrison), and overwhelmed by our own and the fire of our supports-called for quarters, and were ordered in detail to make their way to the gorge, whence they were transferred to a place of security.

Not one of our men was injured. The whole force engaged on our side consisted of 80 riflemen and 24 men detached for service of the grenades and fire-balls. The remainder of the garrison were ready for action and remained in position.

The force of the enemy exceeded, according to the statements of captured officers, 400 men. Captured papers would indicated it to have been 870.

His ascertained loss was 6 killed, 15 wounded, and 106 prisoners, of whom 11 were officers.

We captured also five barges, five stand of colors (among them a flag, said by the prisoners to be the flag borne from the fort by Major Robert Anderson in 1861), and a small quantity of arms and accouterments. Most of the latter were thrown overboard by the prisoners and lost. Several boats drifted off with dead and wounded men.

The action was brief and decisive, as they found us prepared, and were themselves surprised at meeting more than a nominal resistance.

The Charleston Battalion fully sustained its well-earned reputation by cheerfully enuring the hardships of their position and moving forward with energy in the moment of danger.

All the officers performed their duties well. The adjutant of the battalion, Lieutenant W. Mason Smith, rendered me throughout great assistance.

I have the honor to refer you to the accompanying papers, containing lists* of killed, wounded, and prisoners, and of captured arms and other property, and also a sketch of the fort,+ showing the positions of the interior communications and the dispositions of the troops.

I cannot omit to mention the services of Captain J. T. Champneys, of the Engineer Corps, who has shown great zeal and ability in conducting the defenses of this work.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
