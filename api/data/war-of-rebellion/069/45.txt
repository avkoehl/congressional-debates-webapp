movement of Hancock as early as 2 o'clock this morning. From other prisoners, who state the circumstances in detail, I learn that night before last, during Ewell's attack, Longstreet's corps was moved from the enemy's extreme right to the rear of his left, and at a late hour of the night moved back again. I state this because there are reports in the papers that a part of Longstreet's corps, no included in Pickett's division, has appeared in front of General Butler, whereas our examinations account daily for Field's and McLaws' divisions. an intelligent prisoner reports Johnson's division to have numbered (prior to night before last) 1,160 muskets, and says it suffered then also. I transmit Richmond paper 19th instant, giving some account of Sheridan's return.

Respectfully,

GEORGE H. SHARPE,

Colonel, &amp;c.
