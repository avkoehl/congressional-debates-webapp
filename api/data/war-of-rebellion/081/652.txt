HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT,Richmond, Va., June 14, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of Northern Virginia:

COLONEL: Having relieved Major General R. Ransom, in command of this department, I respectfully request that Major G. Campbell Brown, adjutant and inspector general's department, of the Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia, be ordered to report to me. General Ransom has taken most of the staff of the department with him and leaves it without an inspector. None of Major General Ed. Johnston's staff having been captured with him I am under the impression that it leaves the Second Corps with a surplus of staff officers. I was informed by General Cooper that the transfer of Major Brown to this department would depend upon the consent of General Lee and General Early. Hence I make this application to you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. S. EWELL,

Lieutenant-General.

[First indorsement.]

By order of General Lee:

W. H. TAYLOR,Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Second indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS VALLEY DEPARTMENT, August 9, 1864.

Major Brown reported to Lieutenant-General Ewell about June 26. For Lieutenant-General Early:

A. S. PENDLETON,Assistant Adjutant-General.

SWIFT CREEK, June 14, 1864 - 7. a. m.

General B. BRAGG:

Commanding officer at Plymouth fears an attack in force which he cannot resist successfully. His regiment is much needed here or at Petersburg. Is it not best to evacuate, under existing circumstances, Plymouth and Washington?

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

SWIFT CREEK, June 14, 1864 - 7.14 a. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

Movement of Grant across Chickahominy and increase of Butler's force render my position here critical. With my present force I cannot answer for consequences. Cannot my troops sent to General Lee be returned at once? Please submit my letter of 9th instant to President.*

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
