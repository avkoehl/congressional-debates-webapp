26th Cong—2nd Sess.
Pre-emption Law—Mr. Calhoun.
Senate 
regard himself, on his little domain, more a free-
holder than a squatter; and as the price in the de-^
scendmg scale of graduation approaches the price
that lands such as he occupies would sell for, his
industry and ec-nomy wilt be exerted to be pre-
pared with the requisite means to make the pur-
chase. The liberal character of the policy would
impress him with deep feelings of respect for the
justice and care of the Government; and the secu-
rity it would afford would put an end to the esprit de
corps, which otherwise would be so strong; and all,
combined with the influence of the States on the side
of the Government, would, I feel confident, guard
effectually against the danger of losing the lands,
as far as the occupants arc concerned, in th? only
way that would be practicable.
The amendment proposes to leave it lo the States
to graduate and grant pre-emptions or not, at the r
discretion, within the limits prescribed The con-
ditions of the several States are very different in re-
ference to the expediency of exeicismg the right.
In the uniformly fertile legion in the upper portion
of the great Valley of the Mississippi, it may not
be necessary to resort to either, or, if so, to a very
limited extent; while 11 the Southwestern States, in-
cluding Arkansas, it would be indispensable; and
hence the propriety of giving the right, but leaving
the exercise to the discretion of the States. Each
State would be the most competent judge whether
it should be exercised or not, and to what extent.
Having considered the provisions intended to
guard against the danger of losing the lands from
mere occupancy, without payment, I next propose
to make some some remarks on that of their being
lost, in consequence oí the conflicting policy be-
tween the new and old States m reference to them,
should the present system be continued. To un-
derstand this danger, we must have a just concep-
tion of the cau^e m which it originates, which I will
endeavor first to explain-
In the nature of thing", ltj'is impo sthlp that
the new and eld State? can take the '-ame view
of the policy proper to be adopted in reference
to the public domain. Their respective po«.i-
tion, interest, and extent ef knowledge m refer-
ence to it, are wholly different, which cannot
but have a correspondent effect on their view* The
©Id States s and in rcferenc° to th^ nrv some-
what in the light ot an absent otm r of
a large estate, snd not without «onv of
hi- feelings, ubi'e the n w stand, in some degree,
in the situation of tho*e who occupy and wo'k his
estate, with feelings not a hule akin to ihose which
belong to thai relation. That such is the case, and
that it lead-, to diverse v ews of the policy that
ought to be adopted, and ¡hat, again, to conflict
between them, the questions now befce us, the
discussion now going on, Ihe feelings it excite',
and the yeirly and violent agitation of those ques-
tions for the last eight or ten years,abundantly prove.
Nor is .t less clear 'hat they h'->v<> increased, and
must incref>e with the growh 'jnd ínfluenc of tlw
new State-, over the action of ¡h G-oy-rnment, till
their rapií g owh will give them the ascendency,
when they will decide it m their own way, under
th* high pretensions and excited feelings ot real or
supposed injus ice which must neccs anly grow
out of a long con ii,ue i ani vi dent conflict ft is, m
like manner, e'ear thai ihe evil originates m the
ownership and administration by the Government
of ihe lands ljmg in the new St?te-, and consult-
ing a larger portion of ttieir Territory If, to these
considerations, it be added thit'he question grow-
ing out of this great t-ubject must extend to and cm-
brace, and influence ui thnr b aruigs every oilier
question of public policy, as is lllusliatcd by
the amendment for distributing the nrccseds of
the sale  of the lands among the Sta •"-, which,
in its cons qaence«, tak^ in «he who'e circle
of our legislation, and that it UiU-t rntPi in-
to and inflame^ alt our p-iiuual s rug-ie11, es-
pecially «hit in which all otheis ai • concen-
trated—ths Pioaideitial election—some conception
may be formed of the distracting influence, ih° agi-
tation and dagger which must °i iw out of this
great quest.oo, if not speedily settled
If something be not done, it is not difficult to
see that the dang'r fcom tnese causes and that from
occupancy must run together, and that their com-
bined forces wi 1 be altogether irresistible The oc-
cupants on the public lands lying within the States
are voters, wuh a weight at the polls equal to the
most wealthy, and, of course, an equal influence
over the election of President and Vice President,
members of Congress, and State Governments. I
hazard little 'n a'STting that, if they have not al-
ready, from their numbers, a decided influence over
all the elections in many of the new States, they
will, m a very short period, from their rapid in-
crease, if nothing should be done to arrest the evil.
That influence would be felt here, and move-
ments would be made to satisfy tihe demands
of so numerous and powerful a class till \uth their
growing influence, the proposition will be boldly
made, to give, as has been stated, ihe land with-
out purchase, to which, from the n cessity of the
case, the Government will be compelled to yield,
in order to avoid Ihe danger of being seized
and kept m open defhnce of itsau'hotity.
Ag'inst this, the only ground that cm be devised,
as far as I can see, is the one I have proposed,
to dispo e of the land to the States—to part wuh
ownership and administration, the root of the
evil—on fair and equitable conditions, with the best
possib'e provision's that can be devised to ensure
the faithful performance of the compact. If that,
with the provisions against the danger from occu-
pancy, cannot prevent the losi of the publ c land>,
i know not what can. I have as stiong confidence
as the nature of the subjec' will admit, that it will
when perfected in its details by the wisdom of the
Senate, prove all sufficient, not only to prevent
the losaofthepublicdomam, but toan est the many
and growing eviK, to which I have a'luded, as
incident to the sytem as it now exists.
But, if in that it iu possible I shot'l 1 err, with
all the caution I have taken 'o eoipe to a
correct conclusion, I feel a-,iv>red I cannot, in
asseitmg that the danger would b°far 1 s-; under
the amendment I intend to propose, than it wouM
be should th system coitnue as it now stand1-,
and that if tne publ c domain is to be 1 st, it is far
better it should be nn ier t^e foimer than the latter
It mould be with far ¡e-s mteimediate bayard, and,
in the end, with less violence and shock to our po-
litical fabric In th" one case we could lose no-
thing but the value of the Jan', which Í shall pre-
sently show is far le^s than usually esiimated, wh la
m the other no one can estimat what d e ¡o5s may
not be.
Having no ,I tra t, shown to the satisfaction
of the Senate, that no hmg shoit of dispcsmg of the
pubic land' on ju t, eqmttble. and lihetal terms
can n.medy the evil , and guard against the dan-
gers incident to the s>sieni, under existing circum-
stances, it only irmains lo consider what «ouli be
the effect, of the measure on th> revenue, com-
pared with the present system. Shoiil 11 b  able
to prove, as 1 rope lo do, that ewn in that respict
it will bear a highly advantsgeous o itnpanM n, <i
would yield more, and t>>at when mT-t ncded,
now, wh.-n th" Treasurj will n-qure ¡tpVn «¡hmg,
every sw'ii objection to i s aJop' n /< uld, I truM,

mated at 6 nur cent -imp'e interest, and four times

two vear-    I do not take frac ions  of ye*rs into
the estimate    The pnnc p'e is famihar t  all who
are in the habit of calculating (he present value ot
annuities for a given number of years, and is as
applicable to regular annual incomes frpm land, or
any other source, as it is from what is usually
called an annuity. On the same principle, dis-
counts are made on payments in advance. But
we arc ai the daily habit of overlooking this plain
¡•nd familiar principle, known to every business
man in the maiifgement of his own affairs, ia efti-
matmg the value of the public domain. In conse-
quince of such oversight, ihe 160,000,000 of acres
lying in the new States have been estimated to be
worth $200,000,000, at $1 25 per acjte—a sum
neai ly eight times greater than its real value, .sup-
posing that it iftould give an annual income ave-
raging $2,500,000 annually, and admitting every
acre will be sold at $1 25—a supposition far
greater than wi 1 ever be realized The Committee
oi Public Lands, at the last session, assuming
these data, proved mcontestably ihat the true pre-
^°nt value did not exceed twenty-six millions and a
half of do Urs Tlicy showed, in the first place,
thtt a permanent income forever of $2 500,000
woul 1 be worth but a fraction more than forty-one
millions of dollars m hand, as that sum, at six per
c^nt. would give an equal income. They next
showed, that to derive an income of f9,500,000
from the hundred and sixty millions of acres in the
new States, wool! exhaust every acre in eighty
years; and that, of course, instead of being a per-
mtnent income, it would be one only for that pe-
riod, which sould reduce Us value to about thirty-
four millions of dollars, which would bs its present
value, if there was no expense attending its sales
and management. That is, however, far from be-
ing the case. Applying the same rule of calcula-
tion to the annual expf me incident to their manage-
ment, including what would be saved by the Go-
vernment, if the cession should be made, as-
en*'amed to be about §550,000 annually, they find
the pre-HiT va'ne of the land to be the sum stated,
(f)G 500,000 ) The resu t, assuming the data to be
co rtct, i- incontrovertible; and th&t sum would
constitute the en'ire amount of the loss under the
piesent system, if the lands were rcally to be given
away by the proposed ce.sion, as lus been most un-
fairly clwged on th  other side of the chamber.
I propose to apply the same principle to the same
land^ tosh wits present value, under the operation
of ih  measure I intend to propote. Should it be
ad p ed, the whole of the lands in question would
beso'd, I assume, in twenty-five years from the time
they became sr'ijec' to the graduating process—
