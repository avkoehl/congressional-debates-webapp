I hope you have had nothing to do with such agreement. The recruiting for three years or during the war should not be postponed an hour. You will spare no effort to carry that recruiting into effect, and be on your guard against giving any assent or countenance to such postponement. If Governor Curtin neglects to act under the authority given to him to recruit for three years, that is his own affair. But you are to give his neglect no countenance or assent, but, on the contrary, do everything in your power to promote the three years' recruiting.

Secretary of War.

Governor CURTIN,

Your dispatch received. The Department cannot sanction any postponement of the order for recruiting for three years' service, but earnestly urges you to execute without delay the authority given you for that purpose.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I have much difficulty in getting a department force organized for immediate service. There is no doubt, when the measure is fully understood, a force can be raised. There is a regiment of militia, nearly full, ready to turn aut at a moment's call under my order, armed and partially uniformed; but they are unwilling to change their status, as is also a company of artillery, with 36 horses, but no pieces. This unwillingness appears to arise from the indefiniteness of the length of service, and my inability to satisfy their minds as to the place of their entire service. To what extent is id deemed advisable, to accept the voluntary service of these troops, and to furnish arms, clothing, &amp;c.? I have asked the regiment to go into camp at once.

W. T. H. BROOKS,

Major-General.

Gov. F. H. PEIRPOINT,

Wheeling, W. Va.:

The Secretary of War telegraphed June 10:

Intelligence received this evening of the enemy's designs makes it certain that you cannot be too early or too busily at work, as Pittsburgh will certainly be the point aimed at by Stuart's raid, which may be daily expected. You should frankly inform the people of Pittsburgh that they must be at work. I was told you were at Alexandria, or I would have communicated with you before. What can be done in Brooke, Ohio, and Hancock Counties in the way of raising troops for home defense?

W. T. H. BROOKS,

Major-General.
