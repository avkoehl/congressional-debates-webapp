The SECRETARY OF WAR:

MY DEAR SIR: I inclose you a copy of a dispatch sent last night to the Governor of Illinois by direction of the President.

Very truly, yours,

Governor RICHARD YATES,

Springfield, Ill.:

Your sixteen regiments of infantry and battalion of artillery will be accepted, on the same terms as those from other States, if already organized and promptly sent forward; but time is more valuable than numbers of regiments. Be rapid in action and report as soon as possible.
