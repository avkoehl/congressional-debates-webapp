Orders, No, 145, current series, herewith inclosed,* I have found it absolutelly necessary for the interests of the service to assign Bvt. Brigadier General Stewart L. Woodford to a command according to his brevet rank, subject to the approval of the Presidnet. I have the honor to request that my action in this matter be approved or disapproved; that I be notified of it with as little delay as practicable. Troops are now arriving here from the North commanded by general officers, which will render it unnecessary from me to deprive myself, except for a short time, of the services of General Woodford as chief of staff.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.

Brevet Major-General SAXTON,

Beaufort, S. C.:

The loss of the steam-boat Governor Troup and the disability of the Amazon compels me to take possession of the Planter until such time as I can supply her place. The quartermaster will give you another boat. Please order the Planter to Hilton Head.

You will immediately send to Augusta, Ga., to report to General Molineux, the Thirty-third U. S. Colored Tropps, and also three regiments of Colonel Graham's brigade whose terms of service do not expire until after the 1st of October next.

You will not send any regiments to Savannah nor diminish the number of your posts until you get re-enforcements, which have been ordered to you. You will occupy all important points in South Carolina opposite your district whitin twenty miles of the Savannah River. You may allow civil magistrates who take the oath of allegiance to exercise their functions at points which you cannot conveniently reach with you troops.
