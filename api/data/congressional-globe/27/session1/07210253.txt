THE CASE OF McLEOD
IN SENATE,
"Friday, June 11, 1841
The business before the i enate being the mo-
tion of Mr Rives to refer so much of the Presi-
dent's Message as relates to our foreign pffairs to
the Committee on Fore gn Affairt,, and Mr Cal-
houn bavins concluded his lemarks—
Mr HUNTINGTON addressed the Senate sub-
stantially as follow-
Mr President Ths importance of the princi-
ples involved in the present i iscussion induces me
to throw m>self upon the i> diligence of the Se-
nate, to reply to the remarks wh ch have b°en
made by the Senator iron Pennsylvania, [Mr Be
chañan] and the Senator from South Ca-olina,
[Mr Calhoun] '1 o the able and conclusive argu
ments of my friends from Virginia < nd Massachu-
setts, [Mr Rives and Mr. Ciioate ] it will not be
expected that much, it any thing, can be added,
but the nature of the «ubject, th,e nove'ty of the
doc'nne> advanced, and the pt'ackup n the cha-
racter of the EiecJ'ive Admirara ion, as wanting
in energy and «pint, wi ' jus <y even a repetition
of the vi'wí wh ch are enteri m°d by th se who
approve o the course "vhich has been taken by
the Adrmnis rrtion in respect to the matter;, which
have given nse lothis deb<t e.
Perhaps no documen s ever emana'ei from the
Department cf Scats of the United Slates which
have rec ived more univer al commerdation and
approval t om ft cm tl-e American people, so far
ai the) have had an opponun ty to read and con-
sider ihem, than the le ter of ihe Secre'ary of
State to Mr P >x, and the instructions to Mr. Cri'-
tenden, (the Attorney Gerif ral,) v hitn have led to
this di cu sion. Men ol all parties, ihe public
pre«s with very few exception , ( o far as I know,)
juris s, and the people pt large, have united m
speaking of the e pap r  as ¿e ervig of all praise,
for their sound doctrine, patiuue spirit, and firm
devotion lo the intere U and in nor of the country
For the first time alu osf they are, at least partial!}
condemned, and that, too, m the Senate of the
United S ates And the S^a or from Pennsylva-
nia disapproves of them—
1   A  con am ng doctnnes not sustained hy, but
opposed to, t-e principles of in ernational law
2   As having b°en written ^hi e a marvellous pa-
nic was prevailing, as evincing a spirit not credtta
ble to the America , character, van ing in ne'-ess?-
saiy energy, and nU posse ing sufficient .* ^erican
spirit
These I consider grave charges. They are con-
demnatory of men who hive filled orne some
«pace in ths eye ot the pub'ic, i¡ i , > 1 "own to
be men having some acqaair>t "ce wi'li public law,
and who l ave no*' n i obnox us to the charge ot
being under he mfljerjc" of ihe far of foreign
G vernments Th a e men vho hold the im-
portant s'atiois o President and Heads, of the dif
ie ent Execu ue Depar'meMs I ba/e heard it
said that a firmer Chiet Jus'ice oí ihe Un ted
Sates, after havirg for -ime hours, or '<y, lis-
tened to counsel who occup ed the time of ihe court
n stating cierren a^y principles never doubted,
and having no application to the case en trial,
very s gnificantly, jet courteously, remarked to
him that it wa to be presumed, from the peculiar
organiza ion of the Supreme Court of the United
Sia es, the Judges hmio sonefrine; So ¡  nay be
said of such men as the Presumr, Mr Webster,
Mr. Cnifnden, Mr D  rg, and itc oth*r Cabinet
officer , that it is to be presumed, from their cha-
racter , their pur-u is, and other circumstances,
they know so nething about the principles of inter-
national law, and possess something of the cha
racter of American citizens and statesmen They
may all oe wrong in the views they have taKen of
the mat er now under debate, but trie presumption
i-, that ihpy have not acted through viifu1 igno-
rance, nor from any other but the spin and feel
mgs which should actuate every American func-
tionary They are to be presumed to be innocent
of what I cannot but call accusations which have
been made against them, until proved to be guilty.
And, sir, in the remarks I propose to make, I in-
tend to consider all the points which have been
presented as furnishing matter of condemnation of
the Executive and his constitutional advisers I
intend to analyze the speech of the S-nator from
Pennsy lvania with courtesy and fairness, as he al-
ways does when commenting upon the remarks
of those from whom he differs I intend to contro-
vert all the points in which he has condemned the
Secretary oí Slate, and endeavor to show that bis
views are not sustained by precedent, nor .founded
in principle The matters discussed are of deep
interest They have a bearing beyord the present
subjee , to which thev have been applied I think
they effect our character as a nation, as well as the
character of the Executive and his Cabinet It is
to be seen whether the Executive of the country
and the persons whom he has called fo assist him
m his hijh office are justly chargeable wi h being
actuated by unnece<sary alarm, with being under
the influence of a pane, with being wanton m
Ameno tn spirit and fimnes , with evincing a
spir t of fear, alike unnece5sary and d screditab'e
In this view, th- d scussion rs one of paramount
irterss , and I believe it will resuli, or otiers of a
like character have done, in adding another 'aurel
to the tiow of him who, while hu motto has ever
been, "Equal and exact justice to all nations,"
has, in cinection with, practised upon another,
equally significant and patriotic—' Our coumry,
our whole country, and nothing but our coun-
try "
Before I   proceed to  c insider the tonics wh ch
have been   embraced m   the   pnsent   debate, <uid
which  have been el  bi ra'ely eximmtd  and   con-
sidered, I wish to submit two preliminary renmrks
One is, that if it «hould b" thought indelicate to in-
troduce this discussion, under existing circums'an-
ces, the  fuends of the present Administration  are
not  accountable for it     It is well Known  that the
matter of tt c arrest and indictment of McLeod   is
now p ndim r fore   th'    Supreme   Court  <f the
Stfte of New York upon  a habeao co-pu , prayed
out to procure his discharge     The case has  been
irgued  before that court     The discussion   at   Ihe
bar has  closed     The   case remains for adindiei
tion, andis yet unde"idprt     If, then'it  siould   be
supposed that a debate h re, upon the pt nts alrea-
dy argue 1  but not decide I, is oat of place, as hav
inga tend-fcy improrer'y to interfere with a mat-
ter und r judicial adv se '•ent, and es^eoipl y as no
practical result having ary cornee ion with  the in-
terests or ihe   honor of the country would fol ow
f'om the debate, irasmuci as no action of the Go-
vernment is invoke!,  it   should  beiememoered
that it is the work of tie  or oonents   of the   Ad-
mmistia'ion,   and   fot    wici    they   alone    are
re p psibie.    We have   rot sought  this discus
ston.    */e  ha^e ""i1  nothing  whien   houH pro-
voke it    Whatever of real c apparent mpro
priety there may b*. in introducing it, is   to be at-
jibuted to thoS  who act on the off rsive—ro'to
us,  wbo act  on the defensive      The other pre-
liminary reuvik is   that t*ie  effect—the necessary
consequence of the doctnnes a-Varced by the Sena-
tors iiom Pennsjlvama and South Carolina,  is to
relieve the British Gov< rnment ftom   he  respe <,si-
bility of < n er nc; an armed frrc  to assemble, and,
m time of peace, to meke an nnju&t fiable ml un-
authonzed entn irto our terntr rv, and to trarster
th<it responsib 1 ty i "> an obscure individu-1   to  ab
solve ihe orly responsib e party— he na 10    which
avows the act as having been d< ne by Us authon'y,
a (1 a sumes 'b' consequences of it—and   to «i-ek
redr-^s by pskmg a State court to  order the indi-
vidual who oid the offers ve pet  (if legally con-
vie ed) to  b   executed, and whei this is done   ihe
national  honor has  been sustained, the  natit nal
wrorg  may be  considered   as redressed       I am
aware that this ic  not  admitted to be s> legitimate
consequence of the doctrine assimed     I  know it
is said that the remedies are cumui  i"e—that the
Government and trie individual are bo'h responsi
ble—the one for ordering the pet to be done, and
ihe other for performing it     But I th ink it v. ill be
found that it is impossible, in the presenj case, to
unite individual with national responsibility—that
no precedent can be found for holding  McLeod
liable as an individual, and hanging him as a male-
factor, and at the same time lo ¡king to the British
nation for an indemnity for the consequences of
the act as done by her authority, and taking such
mea«ures as honor and duty may require to obtain
suitable reparation. The Sena or from South
Carolina argued that this was like the common
case of principal and sgentm relation to torts or
crimes, both of whom, he said, were liable as
wrong-doers As to the municipal law of principal
and agent, nothing is e'earer than that, in civil
case.,, as to contraes, the agent, who does not
voluntarily incur a personal responsibility, is not
liab'e when acting as agent, if he acts in behalf of
known principal, and as to torts, he is not respon-
sible,^ he acts under an authority which the law
requires him to obey, or presumes that he cannot
resist Thus, !n the case of husband and wife,
she is, in general, not liable, if she commits a tres-
pass in presence &f, and by command of her hus-
band S>, too, he who acts under ihe order of a
legal ttibunal, in executing a criminal convicted
of murder, is justified The reasonable principle
is apihed, ihat thete is no accountability where
tnere n. no free agency. But I am anticipating
what I have to say on the subject of individual
liao I ly I refrain f< r the present, from pursuing
it further, and only add, that the issuo shou'd be
presented iairly to the nation, as it really exists;
as ore in wbica the Administration ask and insist
upon th" responsibility of Great Britain, and their
opponents, lo iking away from that Government,
fix that responsibility upon McLecd alone Such
is the case presented to tne American people. They
will fiid no difficulty in making up their opinion
upon it
Wt h these prefatory remarks, I proceed to con-
sider the matters wh ch have been presented in
this debate And it is well to look at the precise
questions in con roversy We are not now discus-
sing the que. don whether Great Britain is cotiect
in her pretens r n that the ( estruction of the Caro-
line was ju tif able as an act of se'f-defence—as an
employ neut of ltrce for the purpose of defending
the British terutory from th  unprovoked attack of
a band of Engli h rebels and Americans, or
whether, ac the Government oi the United States
regards it, it was a mo t unjustifiable invasion in
time ol peiee of the territory of the U"t cd States.
Tins s-ibject i^ not connect d wi h that now under
ai cussur Nor is it necessary n mqure whether
a i act done ir gmal y without - thorny from the
Go ^eminent, is exempt from it consequences of
per t nal respens tul y, by reason of a subsequent
recognittot u it by me Govefirent for no such
case exis s fa b cretaiy if State, in his note to

cretary ot St"te smnd doctrine' Is it in accord-
ance will -in n, and usta^ied bv authority? Or,
as is •> ic 1 by som° csena'ors, is it opposed lo the
law ot na'iOii.1 'sit, and t u„ht it to b=, repu-
dia'ed by the rules ot public law? I propose to
answer mis mqjny, by reference to general ac-
knowledged prmcip e^, liiuepenlent of precedents,
and then to sustain the views taken by the Ameri-
can Government by urdisputeJ authorities and
precedents cf established authority. And there are
several view* which be may taken of the subject,
each of which is decisive
Ihe exemption Jrom pe sonal responsibility, in
the ordinary legal tribunals, of an individual under
the circumstances stated in the communication of
the Secre ary ot State, is the result or consequence
of two plain, reasonable, and well established prin-
ciples of international law   They are the following.
