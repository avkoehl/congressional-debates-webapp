CAMP AT FAIR OAKS STATION, VA., June 2, 1862.

SIR: At 4 a.m. of June 1, 1862, in obedience to orders from general commanding brigade, this regiment was formed in close column of division in the field to the north of the railroad at Fair Oaks Stantion, Va. The regiment numbered 375 men in the ranks, 42 sergeants, fileclosers, colonel, lieutenant-colonel, adjutant, and 15 company officers.

We then moved forward in excellent the enemy with sufficient distinctness to warrant, in my opinion, our halting and renewing the fire.

On arriving upon the crest of a hill within some 20 yards of the road running parallel to the railroad and directly opposite the camp of Casey's division, which the enemy had occupied, the battalion was halted, the enemy being plainly in sight by the road-side, and at once opened fire, receiving a very heavy one in return.
