Examination by the COURT:

Question. At what time on the 27th of August did your division arrive at Warrenton Junction, and how far had it marched that day?

Answer. I am under the impression that we arrived there about noon; the time of the day is fixed distinctly on my mind. I do not recollect the camp beyond Warrenton which we left; I might recall it by looking at the map. [Examining the map.] We marched from some point on this road [indicating on the map the road referred to] by Bealeton, and then down the side of the track to Warrenton.

Question. Was your brigade the leading brigade?

Answer. I do not recollect whether it led that day or not.
