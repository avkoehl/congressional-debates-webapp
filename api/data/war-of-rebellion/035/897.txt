HEADQUARTERS POLK'S CORPS, In the Field, July 4, 1863-9.30 a. m.

Major-General WITHERS:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs that you allow all the troops to pass over the river, following the wagons, except one brigade, and, when over, let them move forward to a suitable camp ground beyond the range of the enemy's guns on this side, and there encamp, if that be practicable. They should at least be moved forward beyond the point where the mountain comes down to the river. The brigade reserved should be so posted as to protect our left flank until the passage is complete. The forward movement should extend to a point of easy access to the railroad, by which the troops are to be supplied with provisions. Orders were issued to division commissaries to proceed to Bridgeport, draw their rations, and place them at a convenient point on the railroad. Let your own brigade commissaries proceed
