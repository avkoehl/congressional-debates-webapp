MAY 9, 1864.

General BARLOW:

Cross with your whole force at once.

HANCOCK,

General.

MAY 9, 1864-6 p.m.

General HANCOCK:

I have crossed with one brigade and taken the road and can hold it. Shall I cross with my division?

BARLOW,

General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, May 9, 1864-8 p.m.

General HANCOCK:

It is found impracticable to move in line of battle through the woods. General Barlow is ahead on the road, his troops in column. I have sent on to know whether he expects me to march on his left or in column in his rear. It will be two hours before my bridge is fit to cross artillery.

Respectfully,JOHN GIBBON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, May 9, 1864-11 a.m.

General BIRNEY,

Commanding Division:

The major-general commanding directs me to say that you will move immediately after General Mott; the troops will be inspired with the necessity of moving rapidly; the heavy artillery will hold the position at Todd's Tavern, with one of your batteries picketing the line of your rifle pits, and occupying the position around the house. You will obstruct the roads in rear and right flank. Guards will be placed along the roads coming in from the right, to keep back cavalry.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANCIS A. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, May 9, 1864-5.50 p.m.

Colonel MORGAN:

SIR: The major-general commanding directs that your order General Birney across at once. Gibbon has crossed with his skirmishers and is building a bridge.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,FRANCIS A. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
