they were suffering. Many hand been killed or wounded, and the remainder being unable to cross the creek in their front, and unable to injure the enemy in their present position while suffering terribly from the concentrated fire which the enemy could hurl upon them from their advantageous position, General Hascall ordered them to retire to the hill in the rear, and ordered One hundred and seventh Illinois to be in readiness to protect their retreat and hold the hill in case the enemy made a sortie to drive them from the valley and capture the hill; but the enemy was content with the blow he had already dealt our brigade while in the valley, and did not leave his works. During the charge of our brigade the Third Division, General Cox, on our left, had developed the enemy and was engaging him furiously, and General Judah, commanding the Second Division, General Cox, on our left, had developed the enemy and was engaging him furiously, and General Judah, commanding the Second Division, conceiving that the works in our front had been vacated to sen aid to the line pressed by General Cox, concluded that the Second Brigade could capture them by making another attempt, and ordered the One hundred and seventh illinois to move down the hill and take up a position in the valley and be ready to charge the enemy's works, supported by the remnants of those regiments that had been engaged in the first charge. I stated that I had but 247 muskets and was certain I could not capture their works, and General Hascall urged that the four regiments of his brigade that had been in the first charge were so decimated that they could render but little assistance. Still General Judah throughout that even one regiment could take possession of the enemy's works in our front, and ordered the One hundred and seventh Illinois into the valley, and stated he would be down to lead the charge in person. Under these orders we moved down the hill and laid down in the open field under the guns of their works and in close range of their small-arms, where we were soon joined by the remainder of the brigade. I moved to the creek, wade across, and ordered some of the Forty-fifth Ohio, who had chosen rather to remain in the creek under cover than to attempt to scale the hill in their rear under the leaden hail, to open fire on the enemy's works and develop their strength and provoke a reply. This firing showed us beyond a possibility of a cavil that their rifle-pits in our front were occupied and their guns in position and effectually manned, and provoked the batteries to open on us in our very exposed position. We laid in this field for nearly two hours, where we cold not use a gun effectually, and yet were under the guns of the enemy, with no chance to advance without being subjected to the fire of many times the men we had, sheltered behind good works. With no artillery to silence their guns, which had a raking fire over the field which laid in our front, and as General Judah did not make his appearance to personally lead us in the charge. I received orders from some one, originally conveyed to me by Colonel Bond, of One hundred and eleventh Ohio, to move off a company at a time by the right flank up a ravine and form on the crest of the hill we had originally occupied. This movement being executed, I found that the casualties of the One hundred and seventh Illinois were very small, indeed, as follows, viz:*

The brigade was formed on the hill and moved to the left to make room for a battery that was now ordered up to support us, after the fight was over, and laid down for the night with One hundred and seventh Illinois on left of front line; built works, and threw out
