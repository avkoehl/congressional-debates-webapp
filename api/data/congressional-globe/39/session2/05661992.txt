THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 2,
how much weight is to be given to the argu-
ment of my friend from Maryland on this sub-
ject, when he himself is unwilling to pursue
the recommendation of the very Department
that he is now the champion of? That is the
question. I take it, it is our duty as legislators
to take the recommendations of the Depart-
ment,, to examine them, to subject them to
scrutiny, to obtain information from other
sources, and then to act, because we, as the
responsible agents of the people in dispensing
their money and in transacting their business,
cannot shirk the responsibility to them by say-
ing that any man said this or that unless rea-
sons are given for it that shall be satisfactory.
Now, what is the case? The Secretary of
the Treasury a year ago was authorized to dis-
pose of certain steam vessels which should
upon investigation turn out to be ill-adapted
to the uses of the revenue ; and the difficulty
was that they were large revenue steamers,
sea-going steamers, capable of crossing the
Atlantic or going anywhere upon the ocean,
made at a time when we were in a state of
war, when they were wanted for purposes not
strictly connected with the revenue, but for
general purposes, both of naval and commer-
cial affairs ; and now that we have come to a
state of peace or quasi peace, they do not
answer all the purposes that they were origi-
nally designed to answer, and they are more
expensive and costly than is necessary for the
mere purpose of revenue police. Now, what
is to be done? We gave him authority last
year to sell these large vessels if he thought it
fit; to take the money he had sold them for,
and expend that money in the purchase of ves-
sels which should be better suited to that use.
It was not considered then by anybody, I
think I am safe in saying, that the system of
having a steam revenue marine should be
changed to that of having a mere sailing reve-
nue marine. If the Secretary of the Treasury,
acting under the supposed authority of that
act, has undertaken to pledge the credit of
the Government in the purchase of property
with means not derived from the proceeds of
the sales of those vessels, then he has violated
the law; and I am sorry indeed to hear on
almost every occasion that the acts of that De-
partment are brought under discussion here,
from some source or other, that some branch
or other of that Department has set the law
aside, and has chosen to exercise its own will,
instead of exercising ours as the law-making
power. I doubt exceedingly whether the Sec-
retary of the Treasury has committed himself
to any such course, and therefore I do not
intend either to condemn it or to criticise it in
advance. All that I mean to say is, that if
he has, having one authority, undertaken, as
the holder of the public treasure, to pursue
another and to pledge the public money for
purposes not authorized by law, then he de-
serves condemnation. I do not believe he has.
Now, then, at this last day of the session it
does seem to me that, although there may be
some features in the bill which have merit, it
is much better for us to reserve the considera-
tion of it until we can be sure that all we do
will stay done for the good of the service.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair
will receive a message from the House of
Representatives.

Mr. WILSON. The Committee on Military
Affairs and the Militia, to whom was referred
the joint resolution (H. R. No. 303) to enable
the Secretary of War to carry out an agree-
ment in relation to water-power for the arsenal

without amendment; and as it is very short

on its passage.
By unanimous consent, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the joint resolution. It authorizes the

ommendations of the commissioners appointed

ers, and to make application for that purpose
of the money heretofore appropriated for se-
curing water-power at the head of Rock
