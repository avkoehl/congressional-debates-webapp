United States Bank Bonds—Mr. Mes.
Sc\ate.
the banks     But the Secietary of the Treasury I
says, in hi? report, that '■ banking institutions have
8 nevpr been jegarded by the undersigned as a class ||
8 of agents generally unsafe when looking to event-
*  ual losses "   And this is an abandor ment of the
¡i dependent Treasuiy1   The Secretaiy does not
say that he considers batiks more safe than othei
tiepositones     His language implies tne contrary   I
He only 88} s that he does not considei them gen-
erally unsafe in rela'ion to eventual payment, wi
plying that he regards them as exposed to occa
sional interruption oi suspension of payment, as
has been experienced
But what do these detached expressions of the
President and Secretary amount to when taken
¡n connection with the fact, that 11 the same doe
uments Hi which they aie found they have both
reaffirmed  the,r   confluence  in  tne  Independent  ,
Treasuiy, and again recommended its adoption'
Sir, 1 think that 1 have shown thit this seiious
charge against the Administration put fortli with
so much boldne&s, of attempting to practice a
deception on the public m relation to the indo
pendent Tieasury measure, has not the slightest
cncumstance to sustain it, not even the authority
of the Opposition journals                                          h
There is one more charge against the Adminis- "
tration and  its friends, only, that I propose to I
notice     It is, that the Independent Tieasui y plan I
is used as a mere rallying cry of party, and is to
be earned through as a paity tuumph     " Whv,
then, "says the ¿senator, "is it again lecommended
"and uiged   upon  us;    Is it as a lallmn   cty of
''pavty5    Is it to drive through a patty t> uimplt,
*  fatal as. I fumly believe such a tuumph vvi ulj
* bp, in the end, to those who iclneve i ' Are
'there, then, Mr President, no ciiounistances of
' national exigency appealing to the dormant, yet
' I hope not yet extinguished spirit of patnotism,
' m which we can rise superior to this fatal bo id-
* age of party, and act for oui countiy "
It seems, then, su, that theie is an intention to
carry this fatal rreasuie through after a11, but it
¡s to be earned thiough, not for the good of the
countiy, not fiom a conviction of its impoitance [
and utility, butas the "triumph of party " Why,
sn, we had pi eviously been told that there was no
intention to adoot this measuie, that, although ,\
recommended '• m name," it was virtually aban-
doned, it was abandoned in practice, and aban-
doned in argument, the Piesident and Secretaiy
of the Treasury weie not in earnest in íecommend-
ing this mensure, they did not wish it to piss,
but desued to em iby the bank according to their
own discietion, and ioi then own pui poses How
these conflicting charges ore to be reconciled I
cannot see, it n ay be clear to the autht r of them,
as, since he has taken his new position I e tppeiio
to view objects through a diffeient medium fion |
what he formeiiy did
But, sir, the same objection applies to the first
charge of a coa'ition between the L\ecutive and
Mr Biddle to reestablish a national bank wi'hout
the action of Congiesa Here are th te distiict
stcousatiot s, all of a serious mipoit, and each one
incompatible with the other two The) all can-
not be true, but tney all may be false I have
proved two of them to be so, nd I believe it quite
«asy to show thit the other is like unto them
1 hey all come from the same prolific souice 1 he
design of reestablishing a nationil bank, in con-
nection with the 1 teasury, and to be a 1 reasui y
bank, is entirely inconsistent with the revival of
the deposit bank system Cotn of these deep plots
cannot stand together If we aie to be cursed
with a national Treasury Bank, we cannot at
the same time be afflicted with the deposit bank
scheme When so many deep and daik plots are
on foot to prostrate the rights and liberties of the
people at the shrine of executive power, it is some
consolation that but one of these conspiracies can
succeed Yes, sir, ¡t is fot túnate for the countiy i
that two evils of such magnitude cannot exist at I
♦he same time But peihaps it is meant that we
pre to have them m succession, first, the national |
lieasury Bamc established by execu ive powe>-,
and then the deposit bank system, without law,
snd suljcct to executive discretion If ei these
1" to come tne Sub Tieasmy scheme, as a"pmty I
tr,umpn " Ihreateiied as the country is with a
succession of such alarming dangers, no wonder '
that even "neutrals" haveaisiei/ themselves, and
boldly come forward to the rescue
In regard, "Vlr Presiden to th s last accusation
that the indepeudtnt IVasu'v pi m, aftei being
entirely abandoned, as well as twice supreseded
by ti e two other schemes, is still to be carr ed
throu'h as a party mersuie, 1 have a few words
to say This language, fell, is not new from the
honorable Senatoi, we have often hea-d it befoie,
and I believe oi every occasion on winch he hf s-
addiessed the Senate on this su )ect He, sir, s
elevated above party spirit and tneordirary pas
sions t> which, m  the fiailty of hnriin  nature,
0  hets aie expo ed H> i as no sp fish personal
oljects, but acts onlv horn puie, patr otic, and
elevated purpi ses These high pre enoicns, sir,
it is no  my purpose to disnute    In íegard to them
1  only say, let the country judge Let tn« coun
tiy judge between him a d bis h tie band of
aimed neutials, who have seceded from their old
associates arid the fr ends wi h whom I act m
sustaining this great measure
But how is it, that oi e claiming such pure, dn
interested, and patno'ic motives imnseil, si,ou!d
beso unchautable to those who may differ fiom
him > Is thcie any known pit íciple 11 morals or
politics by which tne great mass who act together
aie to be presumed to be dishonest, and the small
numhei who diffei fiom them to be honest' On
what authority does the Senator irraign oui mo
tives' On what giounds does he pi^sume to say,
that in sustaining this gieat fea ure, we aie
actuated by no puiei motives, no higher consul
eratior s, then to achieve a meie tern} oiaiv paity
tiiumpl—that this measuie is tobe tamed by
the     I ym * cry ot p u ty
In the offensive sense in which the gentleman
uses the term, I can assuie him tnat tnis is no
paity measure, it was neithei biougut foiv.atd at
first aj such, noi hi^. it been peiseveied n as
such ISO one ought to know the tiuthof this
better than the gentleman himself Where is he
now, at the head of the little Conservative band
of aimed neutials, who, on account of this veiy
measute, have seceded and withdrawn from the
party with which they had long acted' That
tins measuie wouid temporarily weaken the Ad-
ministration, no well informed man doubted
That it was too strong a measure for the weak
nerves of some of our fnends, was foreseen Tnat
theie weie many pinfessmg to be Democrats, who
weie so connee'ed with banks, as to regard this
meisme as in conflict witn then inteiests, was
appatent at fust Theie may have be n some
whose polui si views were honestly opoosed to
it, ei d j ussibly there may have been a lew whobe
p iticai i piratois lead them to assume a post
tion Inst e to it, and to tie pit ty ti i su limed
it, oi   at least, a position of " ai m° 1 neutiality "
In one sense, howevei, nr, it is a paity mti
uie,and   l e ra lyn t ciy of nai'v      it is   ipirty
measuie in  the  °ime  s-nse as  the  le/oluion
in Lng'and of lfasb «is a party measuie     bn,
that was a nauy measure, earned thrifhlva

wealthy classes      It w \s a paity which overthrew
the tyranny rf the  Snnrt , ¡ nd   gave   lioerty a
chance to ¡ally     1 he Indeien 'ent lieasu y, sn,
is a pa>-ty me sur«- m tne same sense as was ou
glorious Revolution      I hat vas eniluti  illy   a
party movement, sustained and earned througnby
the rallying cry of party, which ua.  but anotbei
name foi   the rallying cry of independence and
liberty     The gieat civil levolution of 1800 was
also a paity measure, wh ch ovei threw ancient
Federalism, the first combination of all  he ansto
ciatic elements into a dynasty of political power,
and restored the Constitution at its last gasp     All
great reforms ¡n the political institutions or con-
dition of the people in this country, and all others,
have been nirty measures, and  have been  sus
tamed, p oseeuted, and consummated  l y p-M'y
e farts, party ¿e il, ai.d  he la'lying cry oi  ra ty
But they hive been peities based upon pi i ciple,
inn-rated  bv an tpi ehension ot danger, stimu-
lated by the iovc < f liberty, urited and struggling
for a great and common object
in this sense, sir, the Independent Treasuiy is
j a party movement, a great refoim measure, and
I should v, e be fortuna'eenough to cany it through
and establish its ps-n^i iles, u will, in my humble
judgment, n future fines, beii some dtgree of
| (ompauson with   pe gres1- measmes to which I
I have lef ired Thos  «ho íegird it m no higner
-spect tha i a mere financial ai rang*ment, s quea-
( tion of temporary expediercv, cannot appreciate
the motives of those who consider it as the first
imp itaiit step in the ¡ernm of our wretched
piper monev sj tern on the on  hand, and of our
pol leal institutions ou the othei Its paramount
bjtcts aie, first, the real mdepei dence of the
G element o' all c^rpoiations, ana its finances,
which are the hie blood of eve>-y Government,
and, secondly, the entueseparation and exclusion
of the organized moneyed power from our poht
ical ins notion-. fhedangei from either of these
souices, I am awaie, is not appreciated by some,
but in the apprenension ot others, it is real and
imminent it is not an imaginaty danger The
ev d e <i=-ts, and has already taken d ep root in our
s)il it ought to be, it iriiot be ariested The or-
ganized moneyed power has already, by an msen-
, i ile process, become an important, yetan mcon
grnous and alien elom ni «n our political sys'em
Our system of civil polity, both Sta'e and Ped-
I eial, is i i its theoiy purely populm,free from any
, other ingiedient or any modification of the great
pnniipl  ol populu  sovereignty    Its establish
men', as well as its ordinal y action  is a result of
tne f ipalai will     If any hostile element becomes
i ncorpoijted with  it  us purity is destroyed, tne
¡ harm r ny of i's action is lost, an I j airing collisions
must f i 'on When the oiganized moreyed power
becomes so incorpoiated with the Government as
o ( ins i ute a i esse ttai elementary pimcipleof
political power, tie system will be changed It
becomes at once a ¡nixed system, consisting of
two okrpen s, the populai will and the associated
moneyed power
I This last element is essentially anti Republican,
or even momrchial, for what is the principle of
monarchy , but that of mdej eudent, irresponsible
power, neither derived from, nor responsible to,
the popular wi 1 The organized moneyed power,
when connected with the Government, is equally
I independent of the will of the people, and re-
moved from ai! responsibility to it But I cannot
now go into this question, and have alluded to it
only to show what sort of paity ileus have in-
fluenced the action of the friends of this gieat re-
| foim measure
But, sir, whilst it is asserted that the Piesident
has almud >ned the Sub Tie-ibury in practice and
in aigurnen , we have a commentary upon ins dec-
la! Uni tiit 'recent events" have strengthened
h coi h Itnoe n tise measure "What the Piesi-
' der t cm find," sivs the Senator, "n recent
' events, to su'tatn tne rereived recommendation
'of the ¡sub Ireisu y scheme, it utteily surpasses
' mv poweis of rompiehension to imagine " it
s the i a 1 ed, in a tone of triumph, if tt e banks
have n it íesumed specie payments, if they have
i ot íestore tne curre)"}, and proved that they
aie sound aid safe depositories ft i the pubic
iLvei ue ' it is true, si , that the barks have, in a
1 rge section of the Ui ¡oi, recoveied from their
pro trate cordifion, md úone so in a shoit period
Bit it is erjm'ly true, that this has been accom-
plished in' oi iy without the interference or aid
t f tne Government, but wnilst the Ii dependent
ire siry his been in pri"tical operation, w'u st
the revenueo hive general y been mna°-ed w th-
out the agency of banks, eithei as i eoositones or
fiscal agents Have not these " recent events "
dispioved what was so eaine tly maintained on
the othei side of the Senate, that the banks could
not  recover if the  Government  enould   divorce
, itseli from them in its fiscal concerns' In this
íesoect, tlieiefiieJ ''recent events" have proved
that gentlemen on tie other side of the question
were vviong, and thi  its fnends were light
Although ti e L 1' d J not lecome   law , s*i 1, the
sp->vit on of tl e T e3s i-y fion ba 1c 1 as nrac

stantly asserted last session, injured ♦he banks
