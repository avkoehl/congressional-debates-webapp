OFFICE OF DEPUTY U. S. MARSHAL,

Syracuse, August 26, 1861.

Honorable W. H. SEWARD.

DEAR SIR: Your order to remove Jerome Barber to Fort Lafayette was handed me by W. A. Dart, U. S. attorney. I delivered him to the fort the 24th of August, 9 a. m. I understand a man of our city went to Washington and advised men belonging to our Onodaga regiment that Government had no right to hold them any longer, and I learn six of the men have left and come to this county with their muskets, &amp;c. I shall take these men in custody and keep them for further orders and find out what was said to them by the man I mention. Inclosed please find names* of other men who are here and say they shall not return. Please hand it to the proper officers. If detectives are to be appointed by the Government I wish to take a hand in it as my arrangements are such through the county I can do much good. The man Barber I arrested in this county and shall have more of the [same] kind. The course taken with Barber has done much good in our vicinity.

Yours, obediently,

R. R. LOWELL,

U. S. Deputy Marshal.

SYRACUSE, August 27, 1861.

DEAR SIR: I forgot to put this slip* in the other letter. * * * Our city is in a better shape since Barber was transported to Fort Lafayette. I can clean this county of rebels.

Yours, obediently,

R. R. LOWELL,

Deputy U. S. Marshal.
