NORTH CAROLINA.

The whole number of volunteers transferred to the general service from the State of North Carolina, according to the rolls on file in the Adjutant-General's Office, is:

Volunteers (the Conscript Department has furnished). . . . 67,736

38,166

Making a total of 119,123 white males disposed of in the State. The volunteers furnished by the State were first organized in the State service and were raised under the threat of a draft in case of failure to volunteer, and in response to three separate requisitions by the Governor. The first call brought into service the white males between eighteen and thirty-five years of age; the second call brought in another class between thirty-five and forty years of age, and the third call comprised men between forty and forty-five years of age. Thus all the men in the service from North Carolina, except those having substitutes, are included between eighteen and forty-five years of age. If in the first place the principals be supposed to occupy the places of the substitutes in the Army, the whole number disposed of by the war would come from the class of white men in the State between eighteen and forty-five years of age. This number, according to the last census, is 132,000. Deducting from this number (132,000) the number disposed of by the war (119,877) about one-fourth have fled beyond the reach of conscript officers, or remain occupying that portion of the country where the law has been for some time inoperative. Making this allowance, there remain, 9,658 men between eighteen and forty-five years to be accounted for.

The adjutant-general of the State, in a communication to the commandant of conscripts (dated October 29, 1863), reports that when the conscript law was first enforced a number of companies were received into the service made up entirely of persons subject to conscription and of whom no record has been left. The number of these, together with those who to avoid conscription have joined the old regiments of North Carolina, I have estimated at 7,500, which will leave 2,158 men of this class still subject to the law.

What the State has furnished for the war may be summed up as follows:

Volunteers. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 67,736

Conscripts, through camps. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13,221
