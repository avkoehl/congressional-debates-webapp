Numbers 4. Report of Colonel Thomas T. Munford, Second Virginia Cavalry.

WASHINGTON, [May 16, 1862]-8.30 a. m.

GENERAL: I cannot conceive why my dispatches to you have not been received. I have sent two dispatch every day since I left you. The enemy, General Shilds' command, are now at Flint Hill, on the side of the mountain. Yesterday I went to Linden, hearing that they were moving down the Manassas Gap Railroad. A few troops were passing that way. I captured 15, 2 wagons, and 9 horses. The men were elegantly armed. General Shields has about 6,000 infantry, thirty pieces of artillery, and some little cavalry. They are evidently making for Culpeper Court-House. I presume they will leave Flint Hill this morning. Am on my way to see. They are 5 miles off. I heard that the rest of Banks' command were at Strasburg and fortifying. I sent three dispatches to you, and I now send major Pearkin's dispatch on which I predicated my belief that you were on the other side of the mountain, for as soon as they left Luray for Front Royal I sent you a dispatch containing reliable information as to their numbers and their destination, and I crossed the mountain between Chester Gap and Thornton's Gap, and occupied Gchester Gap with a picket. Yesterday they marched over.

I sent a dispatch to General Lee, as you directed me, as soon as I found they were at Front Royal and en route to join McDowell. I will hang on their rear and watch their movements to-day. If I can do nothing, will join you at once. Will send you another dispatch as soon as I can see them this morning.

Very respectfully,

THOMAS. T. MUNFORD,

Colonel, Commanding Second Virginia Cavalry.

Major-General EWELL, Commanding Third Division.
