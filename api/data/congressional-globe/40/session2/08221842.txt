1842
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 12,
obtained it at the time. Believing that that
was entirely without her fault, that a part of
the fault was on the side of those who made
out the army rolls, the committee thought
they could not do better than give her the
pension.
Mr. POMEROY. I agree that if the soldier
had lived, and if he had chosen to become a
citizen, he would have been such. That is the
..argument of the Senator from West Virginia.
Mr. VAN WINKLE. I do not know of any-
thing that would prevent the payment of a
pension to a foreigner who enlisted in our
service.
Mr. POMEROY. But the fact is, that he
did not, up to the time of his death, choose to
become an American citizen.
Mr. VAN WINKLE. He died in the Army
during the war.
Mr. POMEROY. I have always, here and
everywhere, declared that I would make no dis-
tinction between a native citizen and an adopted
citizen; but I really want them adopted. I
think that the claims of citizens of our own
country, either native or adopted, are a little
paramount to those of persons of other coun-
tries. I do not suppose it is worth while to
make an objection to this bill; but still I think
it is out of the ordinary course. It is an act
of great generosity, and is exhibiting more
liberality than we usually exhibit to our own
citizens.
Mr. CONNESS. The Senator proposes,
perhaps, a fair rule ; but would it not be bet-
ter for him to find some other case to begin it?
Mr. POMEROY. I have never found a case
that would suit.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading, read the third time, and passed.

September 28, 1850, to December 28, 1857,
and from and after the passage of the act.
Mr. GRIMES. I should like to know the
special reason why that pension goes back to
1857, contrary to the rule, as I understand it,
that has prevailed here for years.
Mr. VAN WINKLE. Mr. Thomas died in
the service of the regular Army. His wife re-
mained a widow for seven years and three
months and then remarried. Soon after her
second husband proved to be a worthless
fellow, and she returned practically to the state
of widowhood, and the committee have allowed
her the pension to which she would have been
entitled during her widowhood, which is ac-
cording to law.
Mr. GRIMES. But my inquiry is this:
this pension dates back to 1857, as I under-
stand.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. Eighteen hun-
dred and fifty.
Mr. GRIMES. That is contrary to the rule
both of the Department and of Congress, as I
understand, to date a pension back eighteen
years.
Mr. VAN WINKLE. It only fills the in-
terval of her widowhood; she showed good
reasons why she did not apply before ; I forget
now precisely what they were; bat the com-
mittee were satisfied that she would have boon
entitled to a pension if she had applied.
Mr. GRIMES. I should like to know what
those reasons were.
Mr. VAN WINKLE. They will be found
in the papers. I do not remember them par-
ticularly.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I ask for the reading of
the report in that case.
The Secretary read the following report,
submitted by Mr. Van Winkle, from the Com-
mittee on Pensions, on the 6th of March last:
The Committee on Pensions, to whom was referred
the petition of Caroline E. Thomas, having had the
same under consideration, rcj^ort:
The petitioner was the wife of Thomas S. Gardner,
who was a sergeant in company II, second United
States artillery, and died while in the service at Sa-
vannah, Georgia, about the 28th of September. 1850,
having been thirteen years either a regular or a vol-
unteer. She remained a widow for seven years and
three months, when she married a 3-Ir. Thomas, but
was soon after separated from him, and has had tj
battle with the world ever since for a living. Under
the existing laws she was entitled to a pension after
her first husband's death, during her widowhood,
which pension she did not receive, and she now ap-
plies for what sho could have had if she had applied
for it in time.
_ The committee, under all the circumstances, be-
lieving that her present condition is equivalent to
that of widowhood, recommend the passage of the
accompanying biU.
Mr. GRIMES. I am not going to object to
this bill if this is to be the rule that the Sen-
ate intend to establish. I happened to serve
on the Committee on Pensions for two years,
and I remember very distinctly that the rule
that, had always prevailed up to that time, and
which was followed at that time and until very
recentlyâ€”I never knew that.it had been departed
fromâ€”was, that a pension should only com-
mence running from the time the application
was made, either to the Department or to Con-
gress. _ Now, there is no reason assigned here,
according to that report, why the application
was not made in 1850, or some time between
1850 and 1857, when she married the second
time. Then, in the second place, it seems that
this woman has a husband now alive. They
are separated. We do not know whether they
are divorced or not. We do not know the
character of that separation. They may be
living together to-day. I only call the atten-
tion of the Senate to it. If this is to be the
character of the precedent we are to establish
in rthe future,'there are a great many other
eases that will come within the same rule.
Mr. VAN WINKLE. This is a case, like
many others that come here, which addresses
itself somewhat to the discretion of the Senate,
of course, and to the discretion of the commit-
tee. in the first place, upon their sense of jnstice
and propriety. I cannot recall at this moment
the reason that, hindered this woman from get-
ting this pension during her widowhood. Her
case is a meritorious one, I remember, and one
to which the committee felt inclined to yield
something if they could. They have given her
this pension, which she was entitled to receive
for the services of her husband in the Mexican
