NEAR BROWN'S HOUSE, ONE MILE SOUTH OF DAVIDSON'S, December 16, 1864.

[General WILSON:]

GENERAL: We have driven the enemy from this place and following up. At this point the enemy has turned to the left in direction of Hardin pike. I shall follow up, and will again communicate with you when I reach that pike. I commenced operations this morning at 4 o'clock. Please send any news you have. Hatch did nobly; my only regret is that his captures were not made by the Sixth.

Respectfully,

R. W. JOHNSON,

Brigadier-General.

HARDIN PIKE, December 16, 1864-10.25 a. m.

[General WILSON:]

GENERAL: Occupy Hardin pike where it crosses Harpeth. The rebs have all gown toward Franklin by a road which leaves Hardin pike at the brick church (marked on the map). I will push on in pursuit as rapidly as possible. Since leaving pike I have had very bad roads. Have captured a few prisoners and a few wagons without teams.

Respectfully,
