Public Lands—Mr. Clifford.
H. of Reps
prepfr  to bestow on what I  have to «ay, by the
exhibition of much lhat is new or interesting   It is
ray object to discusi the merits of the fir3t gener; 1
proposition in the bill, and us bearing upon the
interests of the  people, and the finances of  the
country    The argument  lor and against the mea-
sure have been so often urged that it i¡> dt ucult
to   present   them   in   any   new    light,   though
I   shall   endeavor   to   aro d    the   making  of
aa effort  to weaken   the arguments of  others,
by   repeating    iheji.     Ihe   difficuhy   of    the
task is  sufficient to have deterred me from the
undertaking, if I had felt at   lib°rly to consult
my own feelings, without regard to the duty which
I owe to those who have hinored me with tneir
confidence, id send ng me here, as the represen-
tative of their interests    The importance of ihe
question whether the whole revenue from the pub
lie lands shall  be divided among the Sia e3 as a
gratuity, rr whether it shall remam a part cf the
public fund, ftr the support oi the Government of
the Union, in accordance wi h ihe usuage of more
than half a century? u felt and acknowledged by
all.    It is due to the ma™ni ude of the subject, con-
nected and identifi d t.s it'S with other great and
absorbing questions of na tonal po'ici,   bearing

as I thought,reued mainly, i'not entirely, upon a
duty on wines This part of tne argumrnt wa?
several times repeated wi h an air of triumph, and
pressed upon the consideration of th- committee
wilh all the foree of manner and diction peculiar
to that gentleman It is true, he did not under-
take to estimate the amount of revenue which a
duty of twenty per cent on silks or wises, bo h or
either, would yie'd to ihe Treasury, but the scope
and bearing of his remarks are likely to leave the
impres ion that it is almost incalculable. Sir, he
is mistaken m suppcsing lhat wnes are duty free
under existing laws, as well as in the assumption
(hat ihe Treasury would be benefited to any con
siderable ex'ent by the imposition of any duty upon
that arlicle wilhm the principles of the compromis 
act, which ?li sides of the House now prole s to
veneiate, with what sincerity the future will show.
I will endeavor to 'how to the committee the dif-
ference in this particular, as well as in some others,
between mere speculation and plain matter of fact
Give ihe people facts, and they will always deter-
mine right, and permit me to warn gen'lemen that
they cannot be 'org deceived. Truth is mighty,
and will prevail 1 have in my possesion a state-
ment prepared at the Treasury Department, sbow-
írg ihe whole rmouit of wines imported m each
yrar, for the last ih ee jeais, the pre ent rates of
duty, the amou.it tf revenue received, anj the
v hole amount which a duty of twenty per cent
woull have yte'ded to the Treasury in each of
those years. By deducting ihe aggtegate of the
th rd column from t! e aggregate of the fourth, any

But in relation to ths article of wmts, as it is
my design to consider 'ome of 'he gentleman's po-
sitions separately and square them by the facts
The whole amount of wines imported into the
United States, of every description, expressed in
dollars, wa«, in 1838, $2,318 282 Under the act
of 1836 it yielded to the Treasury $194 882 02.
A duty of twenty per cent, which is the maximum
proposed, would yield $463,650 40, from which
deduct $194,882 02, the amount now received,
and the whole amount of gain will be $268 778 38.
Take the next year—the year 1839 The whole
ami unt of importations of Madeira, Sherry, Sici-
ly, the red and other of France, the red of Spain,
and others of all ciher countries, amounted to
§3 441697, the amount of dudes pad was
$289 056 65, twenty per cer-t. would yield
$688 339 40, subract the duty received, from the
last =urr>, and jou have tne amount which the
maximum djty wou'd have yielded in that year.
Take ih" }ear 1840, and by the same me hod of
computation it will appear lhat the e* n lo tne
Treasury vn u'd hive been oi'v $245 '61 45, thus
the importaiions ar  $2 209 176, duties paid
$196 073 79, the It ghrs iat- proposed wcu'd give
$411 835 20, b; dedne in,r the one sum from t'-e
o her, it is shown In a d-mot s r t on, hit if there
sho 11 be no diminution of imp Mtitit ns un'er the
n w duty, it is lmpo >ible for sny i 'abonable
m<ra to expect from that srurce more than the
standard year of 1838 would hive givn, namely,
two hundred and sixty nine thousand dollars.
Remove all treaty siipjlalions, and impose your
maximum rate of du'y to morrow, and this amount
for ihe next year will not b? realiz d
Tne effect of a ¿uty upon luxuries is a'ways to
reduce the consumption, snd cons'-QUtintly to les-
sen the importation, but suppose, un->er th  opera-
tion of the proposed ltnpo-. tion, the importations
should continue to be equ?l io the yeir 1840, and
there is no reas n lo believe that any higher eiti-
m le ought to be made, joti will have a gain lo
the Treaty of less than two hundred and fifty
ihousand doilai1—provided the cacalations are
correct—any ot e may hpure for h'mself, ard I will
rccommet d to the member of t> is committee to
examine th s table, and will ven'ure to express the
hope that it may be beneficial in dissipating ^ome
rf the delus on v¡h ch hao exis'ed e sewhere upon
tne subj ct of a duty on \ ine, I will now ap
peal io my fr erd ftom Maryland lo read the state-
ment, and sa/ if ih s por'im of bis argunenths
any founJatioi upon w m,h u can stand be'ore an
in elligcnt p ople                                .
Mr W Cost Johnsonexp'amed Hesasap-
prrhen'ive that ihe gentil man from Mime [Vlr.
Clifford] hid mis ak >n the point of his remarks
When he (¡Vlr. J ) ibked what «as the duty on
French wines the g¡¡ alemán from S>u!h Carolina
[\Ir Pickens] had respond3d, "nothng" He (Mr
J ) only alluded to wines and s iks as lllustiaiive
of his posi'ion, and he assumed the srourd t^a' of
the seventy-one nillwns of proluctions of foreign
tiations which no v come into our pf Ht, duty fr=e
thi Government cou!d iay at'uly sufficient o neet
tiesanl. o' the ration wahrut 0,'pressug eiiher
comm tce or th  people, and (Hat du'y cou!d be
levied chiefly upo i luxnne-, wntcn would be pt d
by thos-> who wer  ab e aid Wi litis to pay them.
Mr Clifto'd p i o 'ed It s no'in mv power
to perceive th t 1 have m stiken the s^-ope and
bearing of the gentleman's remarks, though ihe ex-
panation is cheerfully accepted, it dots not ob-
viate the force of the reply which I intend to make
to the arguments in favor of the bill, as no other
articles than silk and wines were named, as the
source of additional revenue, to supply the very
large deficiency that must inevitably follow  its
