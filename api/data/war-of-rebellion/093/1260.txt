ander, commander of the post at Cherokee, but all the evidence that I could gather failed to substantiate the charge. At present there is but little use for a commandant of the post there, and under all circumstances, thought it unnecessary to make any change.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. A. REID,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Instead of the report of the 25th I send you Colonel Redi's report to the 29th instant.* Major Wintter's report is not quite ready, I will forward it as soon as I can get it.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

W. A. R.

MOBILE, November 29, 1864.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Macon, Ga.:

Last retorts say Farragut has gone away; Canby's condition is very critical; Gordon Granger in New Orleans, in command. Although reports come from Pensacola that enemy is preparing to attack, I believe he will content himself with raids for the present.

D. H. MAURY,

Major-General, Commanding.

MACON, GA., November 30, 1864-5 p. m.

Major General D. H. MAURY,

Commanding, &c., Mobile, Ala.:

If enemy don't intend attacking Mobile, be prepared to meet raids on Montgomery and Selma from Pensacola.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

MOBILE, November 29, 1864.

General F. GARDNER,

Jackson, Miss.:

Do you know of any raiding party from Mississippi River to strike the Mobile and Ohio Railroad below Meridian?

D. H. MAURY,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FORREST'S CAVALRY CORPS, In the Field, November 30, 1864-6.30 p. m.

Respectfully,J. P. STRANGE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
