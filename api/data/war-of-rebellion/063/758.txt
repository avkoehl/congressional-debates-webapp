ADJUTANT AND INSPECTOR GENERAL:

Renew the instructions to General Polk to furnish the escort. The transportation of these arms is of great importance. Also prohibit the taking of arms in transitu, which has been a great abuse and has produced mischievous effects more than once.

General POLK:

Arms for the Trans-Mississippi Department must not be stopped. You will furnish such escort as may be required.

Adjutant and Inspector General.

I have everything in readiness as far as is in my power to forward the arms, but General Polk, for what reasons I know not, except that it is not convenient for him, refuses to give the necessary assistance. I forwarded the papers in relation thereto to Senator Mitchell by mail yesterday for his information, as he was especially delegated here by the honorable Secretary of War to attend to that matter.
