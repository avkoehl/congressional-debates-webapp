Congressional globk.
*m
Mr BO AROMAN furnished the following statistics I desire
to call the attention of my friend from New York [Mt Ward]
to certain facts appearing upon this record, which will per
haps reconcile him to the course pursued by the House in this
matter It appears here, sir, that the contingent expenses of
the House oí Representatives for the year 1823 amounted to
$37,848, that they continued to increase until in the year 1838
they amounted to the enormous sum of $343 261, and in the
year 1840, the last year for which we have complete returns,
they amounted to §199,219 Estimating the number of mem-
bers at 242, these sums give an average as follows
For 1823, ¡$156 for each member,
For 1838, 1438          do
For 1840,   823          do
I now appeal to the gentleman from New York, whether
these facts do not call upon this House to investigate this enor
mous extravagance'? Is there not enough in these facts alone
to justify the course pursued by the Committee of Retrench
ment and by this House? Isitnotthen bounden duty? Ido
wot say that the members of this House have, for then own be
nefitpiundered the public tieasure, but! do say that theseex
pendnures are exti avagant and enoimcas—immensely beyond
the necessities of this Hou^e
Look, again, at the item of penknives The repo t shows
that the contingent expenses ofthe 26th Congress includes a
charge for nme y four dozen penknives, amounting to $2264,
and for the 25th Congress one hundred and six dozen penknives
amounting to $2 602—an amount greatly beyond the necessities
of the House, or any reasonable application £of its contingent
fund The Houee is much indebted to the committee for these
disclosures, and I have voted for their resolutions thus far, and
intend to vote for the rest I cannot believe that any member
of this House, m view of the facta disclo ed, will say that these
matters are beneath the notice of the House We are p1 edged
to reform abuses it is our duty to do so Let us make the ex
penment, let us begin, and stopping this leak will disclose the
others
Mr CLIFFORD aske3 if the New Jersey members were not
paid out of the cnntingeut fund for 1840
Mr BOARDMAN replied that he believed Mr Ingersoll
was paid out of that fund, but that the New Jersey membeis
were not.
Mr BRIGGS defended the renort of the committee, and de-
rued that any regulation of the mode of supplying the stationery
was an imputation on the House oi Ufa members
Mr McKAY «iaid if any one would read the statements of the
Committee, he would be satisfied that there had been a great
waste m the article of stationery, but he di 1 not deem it an im
putation on the members to legulate the mode of furnishing their
stationery They have a law on the t.tatu,.e book which p ohi
bits members ofCongiess from taking contracts fiom the Go
vernment aid that was eo moie amrnputa'ionont ie members
of the House, than the pmposition now made In his opinion,
<,hey had been allowed too much stationery—much more than
was furnished to the officer of the highest grade in the ai my
and his staff, who had more correspondence to carry on than
many members on that floor
Mr BOWNE said he was quite indifferent as to the disposi-
tion of this resolution dnd its amendment, but he did not feel so
mdifiu-ent to questions affecting the reputation of members of
the House ¡Statements had been made here which, une-i
plained, would have a tendency unfavoiable to the honor of mem
bers respecting the article of stationery Now, the public should
know the members were not responsible for the great cousunap
tion of stationery which had been shown to have taken placa
tie reporters and the letter writers, and every individual who
thought proper to come ihere, took what stationery they tho lght
proper, and the extravaganceoccuraedintbis way heventmed
the assertion that more stationery was used m this way than by
the member*. Theie were some other facts which had been
stated, which were equally worthy of notice It had been said
that the twenty filth and twenty sixth Congresses had
been more extravagant m the atticle of stationery than any
other, but did not membeis know how this had occurred Had
they not been told how many thousands on thousands of docu
ments had been sent all over the country at the public
expense, and not only during the session, but mem
bers had been retainei here during the recess for that
purpose, and stationery had been used by cart load  in sending
political missiles ovei the Union The gentleman fiom Con
necticut[Mr Board^ianJ halchirged that the contingent fund
of a recent session averaged 81,400 for each member and for
another session $800 and this statemert was made in such a
wíy as would lead the peopluto concludethatit was expendtd
m stationeiy It was not so said but such would be theeffect
of the statement Now the report showed what the contingent
fund was spent for it was made up oí a great many items m
eluding engraving and coloring of mans, public printing, and
wagons and horses, and nearly $ 10 OOJ wa  spent in the pa)
ment of the New Jersey members, and there was another item
of nearly the same amount Now without some such expla
nation as this the statements of gentlemen made on this flioi
would produce an enoneousimpiession on the minds of the
people He was of opinion that some great reforms had been
entirely left out of Cuosideiatioi, he thought there should be
some leguiation of the franking privilege, he found the enve
lope paper had cost more than even the letter paper, but cur
writhe franking puvilege, and they would cut eff one gieat
source of evil If the men heis? wished to send documents
home to their constituents, let them purchase the papei in
which they ^ent them If they effected these reform^ the
Post Office Department would not be calling upon them foi so
much to carry on ihat department
[It is due to the Renoiteis for the Globe to say that the ho
norable gentleman's observati >ns on the subject of stationery
donotappiy to them ps they make pi evitan for them^elve^
and have not been mdeb ed to the public purse oxcent in a veiy
few instance, whun then sutioneiy Ins unexpectedly been m
sufficient for the day's proc<.ehn2i= )
Mi MORGAN replied He said it was mie th" Wh g^ had
sent through the country a great many copies tf the Í ife of
Harrison," but the other par y Ind a so sent ,>uncan s
Speeches" and ' Extra Globes " which had a 1 been cnculated
under the franks of membeisof Congress
Mr J C CLARK made a few obseivations on 'he same
subject
Mr BOWNE said three million* of documents had been sent
from the folding room during one vacatnn of which two anda
half millions had been sent by the Whigs
Mr MORGAN continued h ^¡observations
Mr. UNDERWOOD withdrew his motion to reconsider.
The question recurred on the amendmeiit of Mr SUMMERS
to the LOth resolution
Mr SNYDER observed that he rose with the motto of the
honorable chairman of the committee on Ins lips "Begin at
the head of the fountain " Reform m practice, said Mr S
ought to be the object of us all, as we aie denominated the Re
form Congress, and it appeared to him that reform had not
commenced at the right point We have, said he, commenced
by reducing tne number and pay of the pages and clerks—a
thing the people did not request us to do Sir, said be, they pe
titioned thi& Hou&e and instructed us to "begin at the fountain
head,1* and reduce the pay and milage of members of Con
gress, and, my word for it, unless we do so, they will award
no credit ior what we have done We aie, said he,
entitled to none The mode pur&ued m then late at
tempts at reform, íemmded him of the anecdote of the
schoolboy and his master The b :>y was ¿oo late in coming to
school and, on the mister's inquniiig the cause, the boy m te
ply said "It was so shpperj, that when he took one step for
ward, he slipped twoba^k " The master cracked him with his
whip, and exctaimed, 'You rascal, wh\ did you not turn round
and go the other way1*" This o seived Mr ¡3 i-j the kind of
reform we are pursuing here We eo one step fnrwai 1, and
two back He would advise the honest friends of reform to
turn íound and go the other way Hi3 word for it they would
be sure of accomplishing the de*<rable object, if they did so,
and, m ordei to enable them to-accomplish that object he
would offer the following involution
"That the pay of members of this House be reduced to five
dollars per day the piy of the Speaker to ten dollar-per day,
and the pay of the Chiel Clerk to five dohaisper day, that of
the fiist assistant to foui dolíais par day and (hat the pay of
all the other officers and clerks including postmastu andas
sistant, twenty per cent per diem on the compensation now
received by them, and that the mileage of the membeisof
this House be reduced to two dollars foi every twenty miles
they may necessarily travel
Mr BOWNE desired to move an amendment, providmethat
"the several Repórtela having seats m the hall be supplied
with sufficient s ationciy foi then u^e '
The SPEAKER said there was aheady an amendment pend
ing to the amendment
Mr BOWNE withdrew the amendment for the moment
The resolution was objertel to a& out of oidei, and the
SPE \KER sustained ih« objection, on the ground that it con
flicted with existing laws
Mr SNYDER then <5aid It surely could not be out of order
to piopose a measure of reform This Cotigie*& boie the name
of the Refotm Congreso aid he would then, foie £ ippos  that
reform would alwa>s be m order It was abeurd to suppose
that a resolution of the House could notsupeisede i law neated

membeied, tin-. Congie sftss ti ct d f>r ti e expíese purpose
of retrenchthment and reform, and the dominant party now
rested under the solemn pledge to cairy out the e objects He
theref >re appealed from the decision of the Chair
And the question being taken, the decision of the Chair was
affirmed
Mi CAMPBELL of South Carolina to prevent, he said, the
imputation of this being a stationary debate, moved the pre
vious question
And there was a second
Mr BOWNE urged the House to suffer him to offer his
amendment
The ->PEAKER said u unm ru<! consent was required
Mr WARREN, Mr 1LRNEY, and two or thiee others
objected
The mam question was th°n ordered
The amendment of Mr Summers was agieed to, an! theie
solution as amended was adopted
The eleventh resolution being under consideration, m the
following words, to wit
Mesolved, That henceforth it b9 a standirg rule of the House
that, at the commencement of each session of Co igress the
Speaker appoint a committee consistir g of tin ee member, to
