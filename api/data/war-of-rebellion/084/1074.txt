HEADQUARTERS MARMADUKE'S BRIGADE,August 19, 1864 - 9 p. m.

Major EWING,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I am encamped on Bayou Bartholomew near the bridge, one mile above Jones; Ferry and six miles from Tyro. I will march at sunrise in the morning by Tyro in the direction of Mount Elba. I have heard the Saline was rising very rapidly. Will that make any difference in the route you suggested by the way of Mount Elba? If so, you can communicate with me at Tyro in the morning.

Respectfully, yours,

JNO. B. CLARK, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
