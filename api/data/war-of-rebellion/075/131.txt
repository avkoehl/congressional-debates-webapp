HDQRS. FORCE'S DETACHMENT, 17TH ARMY CORPS,Clifton, Tenn., May 10, 1864.

Colonel THOMAS MORTON,

Commanding U. S. Forces at Pulaski:

COLONEL: In answer to your dispatch just received, I have the honor to state that there is no force en route from here to Pulaski. I am here under orders from department and corps headquarters to march, via Pulaski, as soon as relieved at this post by a similar detachment from Cairo. My command consists of about 3,000 infantry and three batteries, two of four guns each. I am encumbered with cattle and stores belonging to General Gresham's command, which will probably be increased on the arrival of the next detachment. I can march well if relieved of these encumbrances. If not, will make the best time possible. I have no news from Roddey later than his occupying Florence. The dispatch of General Gresham was latest before yours. I should think Roddey cannot have 4,000 men, unless re-enforced by s. d. Lee. It is invariably believed across the river, that Forrest was defeated and 400 out of 600 men with him captured, and himself taken prisoners. Please keep me advised from time to time.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. F. FORCE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Detachment.
