133.] COLUMBUS, January 21, 1865.

Colonel LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Cincinnati, Ohio:

How many men do you propose to move each day positively? I understand you not to exceed 4,000, as that would be the limit of the Baltimoe and Ohio facilities. This can be done without large demand from other roads; while 200 cars, w hich would carry 8,000 men, will require a great number of extra engines. I would suggest that no more men be started from Cincinnati each day than can be disposed of by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad daily at Bellaire. Please answer.

T. LOUGH.
