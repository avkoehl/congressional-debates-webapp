HEADQUARTERS ELEVENTH CORPS, March 27, 1864.

GENERAL: Will you have the kindness to attach the inclosed copy of a letter written to Colonel S. S. Carroll, commanding brigade, Second Corps, dated Warrentown Junction, Va., July 29, 1863, to my report of the battle of Gettysburg? Colonel Carroll never furnished me a report of the part taken by his command in that battle. I had presumed that he had done so to General Gibbon until I read General Gibbon's public letter complaining of my omissions. I will publish a card, with a view to setting the matter right.

Respectfully,O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

Major General GEORGE G. MEADE,

COLONEL: I wish to thank you for the prompt support you gave me on the evening of July 2, at Gettysburg, on the extreme right of General Ames' division. I was particularly weak at that point, having only a single thin line, through which the enemy were just breaking. You came up quickly, deployed, and moved into position after your old style. For this and for your subsequent patience in strengthening that position until the close of the attack on July 3, I tender you my hearty thanks.

Respectfully,O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
