General Hayes is missing. We have possession of all ground fought over, numerous prisoners, and two stand of colors. I do not think it possible to establish the line across to-night as suggested in your dispatch. I have Willcox and White in good position to maintain my position. They have both been engaged. Potter's men did not get further than the Aiken house and I have stationed the there for to-night. We are well disposed as we can be against the enemy if he attack in the morning. The enemy everywhere fell back from our attack to-night in confusion, and if the troops had only held a little against the flank attack they could have stood it. If I could reoccupy the line of the picket which was broken to-day I would not think it advisable. We will try it in the morning if not attacked, and if we are we are just right now.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 19, 1864 - 8.30 p. m.

Major-General WARREN:

I am delighted to hear the good news you send, and most heartily congratulate you [and] four brave officers and men on your success. It will serve greatly to inspirit the whole army, and proves that we only want a fair chance to show our capacity to defeat the enemy. I hope he will try it again. In the meantime I would try and get the Ninth Corps on the left to prepare aline and slash it well, so as to secure the connection with the plank road. Parke has a few available troops and I will direct him to occupy as much of the line with them as he can.

HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,August 19, 1864 - 9.45 p.m.

Major-General WARREN:

The Seventh Wisconsin Regiment and, I believe, an Indiana regiment were cut off during the break this afternoon and are now with the left of General Mott's line. I have directed General Mott to use his utmost to re-establish the connection with your right.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 19, 1864 - 10.30 p. m.

Major-General WARREN:

I send you a dispatch* just received from the lieutenant-general commanding. It will not be possible to withdraw Mott, as he suggests, as it would leave the whole of the line recently held by your corps to be held by the colored troops, less than 4,000 strong. A deserter has come in to Parke who belongs to a brigade of Heth's yet in our front. He says only two of Heth's brigades went up to the railroad. On this
