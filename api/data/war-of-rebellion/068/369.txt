steamer Mount is now here, loaded with such stores as this garrison is already abundantly supplied with, and I have determined to send her also to the fortress. I am well aware that I am assuming considerable responsibility by sending those vessels back, but although I am confident that these stores were sent here for a wise purpose, still I am of the opinion that things have taken a different course from what was then intended, and the statement of Colonel Small to Captain Goldthwait has strengthened this belief and I have now determined to make these dispositions.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I. N. PALMER,

Brigadier-General.
