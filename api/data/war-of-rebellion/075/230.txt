General Matthies telegraphed me that the enemy was marching on him in force, and asked for help. I sent a courier after Colonel Rowett as soon as I received the above information from General Matthies, and expect him to-morrow.

Brigadier General JOHN E. SMITH,

Huntsville, Ala.:

Have just received dispatch from Colonel Rowett, written at Florence yesterday, in which he states he met the enemy yesterday near Centre Star and drove him across the river at Cole's Island, capturing a few prisoners, who state that Johnson crossed to strike the railroad, but hearing of my approach with infantry abandoned the idea. He also states that part of the force went from Florence to Seven-Mile Island, and he thinks crossed there. A force has gone to Seven-Mile Island, and Rowett has fallen back to Centre Star for forage and orders.

W. Q. GRESHAM,

Brigadier-General.
