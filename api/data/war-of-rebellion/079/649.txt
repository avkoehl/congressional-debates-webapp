Major General JAMES B. STEEDMAN,

Chattanooga, Tenn.:

All officers placed on duty temporarily at Chattanooga whose commands are at the front will be relieved immediately and ordered to join their commands at once. The intention in directing them to report to you for duty was simply that they might be of some service while the road was broken between Atlanta and Chattanooga, and that they should join their commands as soon as the road was open.

CHATTANOOGA, November 5, 1864.

Major General G. H. THOMAS:

I arrived here to-night with part of my command and my artillery, three days and two nights from Calhoun. I would like to come through without unloading the cars. Most of them are flat-cars. The men ought to get through soon as possible and find some place where they can be sheltered. I understand none of the Twenty-THIRD Corps are at this point waiting shipment. Please answer, if possible, to- night and tell me whether I can have the cars.

Brigadier-General.

Your dispatch of this date received. Your men can remain on the cars and come forward to Nashville as soon as possible.
