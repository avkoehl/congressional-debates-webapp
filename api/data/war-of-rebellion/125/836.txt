Reconnaissance of the Mississippi River.-In compliance with the special instructions of the Secretary of War of December 5, 1863, Colonel A. J. Myer made a preliminary reconnaissance with reference to the establishment of telegraphic communication by a line of signal stations from Memphis to Cairo. He reports in substance as follows:

The route by the valley of the Mississippi was found to be the best. In making the reconnaissance he availed himself of an actual examination of the river and the points selected for stations; a careful study of a map intended for the movement of vessels upon the river, made from the surveys of pilots, and having marked upon it the most elevated points, and the experience and personal knowledge of pilots and river men.
