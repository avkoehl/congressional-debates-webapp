.Sépate, by the casting votepf the Vice President,
This event gave birth to a host of State banks,
the history of which is well known After an
experiment pf fput^ years of this State bank sys-
tem-, another national bank was created, with the
eanotion of Mr Madison and his fuends The
State banks, without the conti oiling check of a
national institution, will not, \ fear, succeed in
seeonng to the people either a uniform or sound
currency. A Bank of the United States, with a
large and sound capital, willjiot only be a useful
fiscal agen¿, but will furnish a currency of un-
questionable value The Constitution has p.s
pigned to Congress the power to com money and
.regulate the value theieof, and, if gold and, silver
will not atiswei oyei this extensive country, and
if a paper íepreserjtative is to be furnished for the
convenience of the people, it has ever seemed to
me, that it ought to emanate from the authority
of the National Government.
Sorne object to depositing the money in a bank
for the benefit of the stockholder, and in that I
pgree with them,and will only do it for an equiv-
alent in money 01 public sei vices     The bank is
an insurei of the safely of the fund placed in it,
if the bank is lobbed, the Government does not
¡ose it, but the bank, the bank must place the pub
lie money in diffi lent paits of the United States
where it is wanted, without risk or expense to
the Government    In tne language of the Const!
tution, and m the spnit of otu fiee institutions, I
am opposed to the giant of any puvileges to any
man or set of men, but m consideration of public
seivices    Are not the public funds moie safe in
sound banks, undei  oui contiol and íesponsible
to this Government, than in the hands ot individ-
uals, with whatevei secui ity they can give'  Gov
ernment raiely makes anything out oí securities,
and, indeed, it 11 probably better that the Gov-
ernment should lose by the appointment of a bad
officer, than that innocent individuals should be
ruined    On this subject 1 will only add, that I
can make no compromise of opinion 01 piinciple,
unless contiolled by the will of my constituent
Mr  P  could not avoid cxpiessmg his astonish-
ment at the assault made by his colleague [Mi
Mwrkay] on the Bank of the United Slates     A
man may have honest sci tiples about the const)
tutionahty of a national bank, but the utility of
such an institution has bten generally admitted
by the intelligent poition of all pai ties in the na
tion     It is most wondeiful to me that a western
gentleman of sense and candor should ob]ect to it
Our trade is carried on with distant States, and a
national cuirency is more important to us than to
any portion of the Union    Our traders now bung
the notes of distant banks and diffuse them among
the people, the value ot  which I cannot tell my
neighbor, if he asks me, but send him to the mei
chant, if he is a poor man or a laborer, he may
■want a ten or a twenty dollar note convened into
silver to pay small debts, and the meiclmnt will
tell him, piobably, that it may be good, but no
very cunent, he will, howevei, change it, if the
man will take the whole or pait in goods, 01 dis
count one, two, or thiee, oi ten per cent , and
the holder will be driven to accept the terms  and
in this way the poor and  laboung classes aic
shaved constantly, for want of a cut i ency stable,
sound, and which can anywheie and eveiywbeic
be converted into gold and silver     In this state
of things, every merchant, besides a host of oth
crs, is reaping a rich hai vest by shaving and rob
bmg the ignorant and laboring chssts ot  the
country
One of the first and highest duties of this Gov
ernment is to relieve and secure the pnople ngainst
a ruinous, inconvenient, or unceitam n ediuin
No part of this Union was more injuied by ficti-
tious and swindling banks and depieciated bank
notes than the West, and it took many years
after the last Bank of the United States was es
tablished to redeem us fiom the evils to which I
have adverted A sound and uniform cm i ency
was ultimately restored to the West, chiefly by
the operation of the blanches of the United States
Bank established there At fust they weie not
as prudently managed as they ought to have been,
but for about ten yeais befoie the removal of the
deposits, we had a jjood cunency, end our con
dition in regard to currency and commeice was
sound and healthy     Bianch banks were estab-
lished at Ptttsburgj ChiUicothe, Cincinnati, Lex-
ington, Louisville, St Louis, Nashville, Natchez,
and New Orleans, and all woiked well, ana I
never heard that any of them engaged in the
party politics of the country Something was
said against the Louisville branch, and piomptly
repelled by two or three directors, warm Jackson
men of high standing It may not be improper
Oi irrelevant, in connection with this subject to
allude to the pecuniaiy condition of the western
and southwestern States They have no surplus
capital to make banks or internal improvements,
and resort to loans for such purposes Not only
the States west and south, but many States on
the Atlantic, have made large loans for those ob-
jects The seveial States are now indebted, and
a great part to foreigners, between one hundred
and one hundred and fifty million dolíais, at an
annual interest pf five or six per cent Yes, su,
after all the clamor about foreigneis and foreign
influence, the States owe a large amount to for-
eigneis for loans to make banks, and if the funds
should be badly managed, or swindling dnectois
get the control of the banks, the money may be
plundered, and then the people must be taxed to
pay the pnncipal and inteiest of these debts, or
this Government may be called on again to renew
the funding system I tiust no such consc
qutnees may giow out of this state of th ngs,
but I must appeal to the gentl man to answei me
with candoi, whethei it would not have been bet
ter to create a national bank, reqnne at least one
branch, with a leasonable capital, to be placed in
every State, and to lend money at five 01 six per
cent to aid the hi siness and enteiniise of the
people' On this plan no debts coJld have been
mcuned by the States, and abettei cunency would
have bien furnished It would ceitainly have
been the interest of the bank to f nmsh as much
capital to each S ate as their business requn'cd
It must be admitted that the branches in the West
were well conducted fo the last ten years of their
existence, whatever may be said of the mothei
bank in her snuggle with the Government I
have nevei looked into the contioversy, but can
icadily suppose that the banL may have been
guilty of some impiopnety and indiscretion, such
as are incident toeveiy human association They
art, howevei, unworthy the gtave consideiation
of statesmen in deciding on a great measuie of
national concein I tepoa', that a man may nh-
)cet, with some plausibility on constitutional
giound, but a western man can have no othei lea-
son for clnmoung against the bank, but because
General Jackson denounced it
My colleague, without using any personal 01
offensive language, has made a lunge at Mr
Clay, a distinguished Senatoi from our State, in
lelation to the American system, which seems to
me to have been uncal ed for and unjust, owing,
I must believe, to misappiehension of facts and
the history of that svstt iii Whatever my íela
tions to that gentleman have been, 01 are now,
I feel it my duty to place him, with regard to that
policy, in a ptopir light bifoie this committee
and tl c public At no time in my life, whatevei
may hive been his couise towards me ot the
ountry, have I tuittd him unfanly At one
pel tod, I had icason to complain of the intolerant
and pi oscnptivc spint of himself and his friends
fieo, howevei fiom any personal bitterness on
cube! side Aftel he became Secretaiv of State,
in alliance with myfiiend from Massachusetts,
he nevei offered me the hand of fellowship, and
he was armed with additional powei to depuve
me of any shire n the political conceins of my
country I thought 1 owed him a debt, which,
with the aid of the hickoiy stick, I concluded to
discharge I did so, and balanced the account
between us I now am lead y to act towaids that
gentleman under the influence of public consid
eiations alone My colleaeue seems to impute
the American system, with all its imaginary evils,
to him, for he has not told us of the mischief it
has done, nor have I evei been able to find out,
fiom the writings, speeches, and denunciations
of gentlemen, wnat the evils aie to wine i they
refer They seem to suppose that the surplus in
the Tieasuty was the lesult of the American
system There is ceilamly no foundation fot the
assertion, and Mr Clay is not responsible for
what accumulated in 1835 and 1836, and was de-
posited with the States by the act of 183C That
surplus was the result of the transfer of the pub-
lic moneys fiom the Bank of the United States to
State banks, with a recommendation to expand
their issues, which gave birth to that scene of
wild and extravagant speculation in public lands
m 1834, 1835, and 1836, that brought into the
Tieasury or the banks that enoimous surplus
distributed among the States in 1836 and 1837,
and which, by withdrawing so laige an amount
from the oidinary channels of trade and business,
conduced much to that derangement of the cui-
rency and convulsion in our commercial affairs
in J837 The deposit act of 1836, with a small
variation, was, in substance, a division of the
land fund among the States, accoiding to Mr
Clay's views Mr Clay made eveiy effort in
his power to prevent a siírplünn the Treasury,
by a distribution of the proceeds of the public
lands among the States, arid if his bill had hot
been defeated by President Jackson, there would
have been no surplus Cut off the (and fund
fiom the Treasury, and the tariff would not have
produced more than was necessary to meet the
usual demands on the Tieasuiy
A vei y small amount was expended for internal
improvements duung the administration of Mi
Adams, compaicd with that expended under the
administiation of Geneial Jackson The fust
great national improvement—the Cumberland
load—had its origin under the admimstiation of
Mr Jeffeison, the woik was commenced under
that of Mi Mid'son.and continued undei every
Administiation since In 1811, thr State of New
Yoilc aoplied to this Government to aid hei with
funds to make a Canal fiom the wateis of the
Hudson to Lake Ei'ie Mi Madison sent a mes-
sage to Congiess, recommending the subject to
oui favoiable consideration, -yid commending in
i the shongest teiros the polky of connecting by
' mteinnl impiovonenfsthc Atlantic with the west-
hemcountiy To cut down the mountains and
l' facilitate the mtcicouise between the East and
I West, was a populai dictune at that time, as
well as to icndt r this country indi pendent of the
vvoikshops of Euiope The southern, western,
and middle States, were gpnetally at It 1st a large
nnjowty, foi this policy The people of INew
England weie less favorable to it than any poi-
tion of the Union I might with tiuth and jus
tice deny that Mi Cuy is entitle d to the ciedit
of originating the Ameucan sysiem forllelieve
Viigmia, South Carolina, and New York, have
equal if not superloi claims The system became
popular, and the eastern States, after some re-
sistance, acquiesced, and Mi Clat, with his
usual political tact, made himself the prominent
actoi When he became Secretaiy of State, and
seemed to be on the high road to the Piesidency,
other aspnants were alarmed, and dettimined, if
possible, to bHst his prospects To lendei the
American system unpopular was an object of the
first impoitance with the enemies of Mr Or ay
The system was too popu'ir then to be directly
resisted and the high tanff of 1828 was a con-
trivance of the Jackson paity for effect on the
system, calculated to injure Mi Clay, whether
his fuends supported or opposed it I was one
of that paity at the time, and it is well known
that Mi Vtn Buien and most of the Jacitson
I men "upjioited it I was a zealous suppoitei of
■ General Jackson at that lime, and we were very
I unwilling for the Geneial to commit himself m
a manner to embarrass his fuends or injure him-
self We w eie fortunately soon íeiieved by the
old hero, who came out for a judicious tauff, a
ground which rendeied him unassailable fiom
any quaiter Mr Chan man, a review of oui
i past political histoiy will show that many of the
leading measures of this Government have bee
earned oi rejected by leference to a presidenti
election
Mv colleague [Mr Murray] professes to ad-
mire Mr Clav much, although the author of so
much mischief, but seems to admiie nullification
mote At the moment Geneial Jackson was pre-
paung, by pioclamation and force bills, to de-
molish nullification and its suppoiters,Mi Clay
mteifered and averted the stoim This I have
conside-ed the besi, and most patriotic act of his
life, and have ever given him lull credit for it,
and I think my colleague, as an act of sheer jus-
