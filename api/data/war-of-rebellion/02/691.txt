CINCINNATI, June 16, 1861.

General WINFIELD SCOTT:

I hear from General Patterson that he is checked at Harper's Ferry. If I do not hear from you to the contrary, I will attack from the west in sufficient force to make it sure. Will require two or three days to prepare. In mean time will arrange so that I can move by the route suggested in my earliest dispatch to you from Columbus, if you prefer. Please reply.

Major-General PATTERSON, Hagerstown, Md.:

What movement, if any, in pursuit of the enemy, do you propose to make consequent on the evacuation of Harper's Ferry? If no pursuit, and I recommend none specially, send to me at once all the regular troops, horse and foot, with you, and also the Rhode Island regiment.

WINFIELD SCOTT.

HAGERSTOWN, June 16, 1861.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND:

Design no pursuit; cannot make it. The enemy is routed by fear. Cross the river to-day. If approved wish to make Harper's Ferry my depot, and can establish line of communication east and west and ad-
