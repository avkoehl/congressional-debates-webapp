1873.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
643
Here it is an antique tower in the plain of our
democracy. In other lands the struggles of
our day have added to popular power, have
in increasing parliamentary authority espe-
cially exalted the Commons. The Prussian
example is recent and striking. In Britain
the lords dare only temporize and delay; they
will not venture to stand defiantly against the
popular will. With us every contest between
the Representatives of the people and the
Executive has carried spoils of victory to the
Senate. With one hand it reaches out to con-
trol patronage against the Executive, with the
other it grasps at the framing of reveuue legis-
lation, dictating taxation and expenditure.
Not directly chosen by the people, it is less
democratic than representatives or executive.
With a longer tenure of office than either it is
prone to forget accountability. Less numer-
ous than the lower House, its members have
more personal power; ye' in the aggregate
of numbers they drown individual responsi-
bility, as the Executive cannot do.
The tendency of events, in this country is
not to aggrandize the President, is only in
s remote measure to concentrate power in the
national Government as a whole. Only the
Senate never ends. Accretions of authority,
settle upon it. In a great emergency the
popular branch may assert itself. The steady,
experienced, permanent assertion of the
Senate crystalizes into prerogative.
Now, such a body ought not to be chosen in
large part away from the ceuters of popula-
tion, of interest, of substantial power. Some-
thing of patriarchal reverence has clustered
about New England, and its voice in the
Senate was fixed at the beginning. It is youth,
extreme youth, which the trans-Missouri, the
Pacific States illustrate. Let it, too, have its
due place in the Senate, but no more.
The great middle States do not fall behind
in population, and they garner the wealth
of the Republic. Ohio, Pennsylvania, and
New York contain twenty-seven per cent, of
our population, and forty per cent, of the
national wealth. They may be content with
only eight per cenX. of influence in the Senate,
but ought they to be forced to decide whether
they can endure less?
Remove more and more the choice of Sen-
ators from the body of the Republic, carry it
more and more to the extremities, and you
will challenge disastrous consequences. Ex-
aggerate more and more your wings, and be
prepared to witness disease assail the very
heart.
But gentlemen insist that the compromises
of the Constitution require the concession in-
volved in the admission of these Territories
as States. How and why? The question of
representation in the Senate nearly wrecked
the Constitution at the beginning. To calm
the bitterness of discussion on this subject
Dr. Franklin proposed for the first time
prayers in the Convention of 1787. Yet by :
the census of 1790 the largest State, Virginia,
had only a little more than twelve times the
population of Delaware, the smallest. In the
debates Virginia was assumed to be sixteen
times larger than Delaware. With only that |
difference giants wrestled over the inequality.
In 1870 New York had one hundred and nine
times the population of Colorado. Is it con-
ceivable that any such inequality would have
been permitted in the original composition of
the Union? The violence of controversy over
the actual adjustment proves the contrary. If
anything was implied it is that the smallest
â– itates to have rank in the Senate shall hold
to the largest State the ratio of one to twelve,
or at least one to sixteen ; that is, that Colorado
must have seven times its present population.
Or again, Delaware, the smallest State, had
in 17!)0oneand five tenths per cent, of the total
population of the Union. If the compromises
of the Constitution are to be appealed to, let
us apply them in their spirit. Colorado had
in 1870 only one tenth of one per cent, of the
population. To bring herself on the plane
which Delaware had in 1790, Colorado must
multiply her population fifteenfold, while the
Union as a whole remains stationary.
Observe that the average poulation of the
States in 1790 was 231,130. In 1870 it had
mounted to 1,030,152. The whole spirit of
the Constitution is adverse to the admission of
new States without power by us much greater
than the smallest in 1790, as the present aver-
age is greater than that of our forming period.
By that rule, no new State should be admitted
with less than two hundred and sixty thousand
inhabitants.
By the ratio of one to sixteen, that assumed
in 1787 to exist between Delaware and Vir-
ginia, no State should now be admitted with
less than two hundred and forty-eight thousand
inhabitants, while New York stands unchanged.
As the nation grows the federal unit increases.
That unit now ought indeed to be greater than
at the forming of the Constitution by the whole
ratio of increase in population. The spirit of
the Constitution requires that any new State
asking for admission should have attained to
the stature of the federal unit so established.
Much is made in the report of the Commit-
tee on the Territories of the precedents estab-
lished by the admission of other States. Look
at them. Except Nevada, not one of the new
States was admitted with a population bearing
so small a ratio to the Union, as a whole, as
that of Colorado. Strong arguments existed
for bringing in Oregon, which do not apply
to Colorado, and yet the ratio of the former
to the Union was more than fifty per cent,
greater than that of Colorado now. Take the
population of the new States by the census
preceding their admission, (except Minnesota
and Nebraska, admitted in 1858 and 1867 re-
spectively, where the census immediately suc-
ceeding is taken,) and it appears that they
, bore the following ratio to the Union :
Tennessee, 1790 1 to 109
Ohio, 1800 1 to 117
Louisiana, 1810 1 to 90
' Indiana, 1810 1 to 295
Illinois, 1810 i 1 to 508
Missouri, 1820 1 to 129
! Arkansas, 1830 1 to 290
Michigan, 1830 1 to 400
Florida, 1840 1 to 313
i Wisconsin, 1840 1 to 554
Iowa, 1840 1 to 395
California, 1850 1 to 249
Minnesota, 1860 1 to 180
Oregon, 1860 1 to 599
Kansas, 1860 1 to 293
Nevada, 1860 1 to 4,585
Nebraska, 1870 1 to 313
i
Colorado holds the ratio of 1 to 9G9. Prece-
dent requires that Colorado should serve a
little longer on probation.
| After troublous discussion, Dr. Franklin
, sought the adjustment of representation in the
; Senate on a basis allowing the members to vote
; on all revenue and appropriation bills " in
> proportion to the sums which their respective
] States do actually contribute to the Treas-
ury." The same result was sought by the plan
reported by the " committee of detail," and
long adhered to in the convention, that " bills
for raising or appropriating money" shall not
only originate in the House of Representatives,
but " shall not be altered or amended by the
Senate."
Had either of these propositions remained
in the fundamental law no uneasiness would
I arise on propositions like the present. Under
I the Franklin plan New York would hold one
: fifth of the power of the Senate. Under the
I report of the committee it would be protected
j by ita strength in this House. Admit Colo-
i rado, and you offset the entire vote of New
j York in the Senate by representatives of a
| State that pays only a nominal sum into the
Treasury, about one half of one per cent, of
the internal revenue. Especially grievous is
this for the largest State. For twenty-five
States show by the ninth census less wealth
than New York, and by the internal revenue
report, twenty six States paid less money than
New York into the Treasury in the fiscal year
1872. The wrong to New York is only an
exaggeration of the wrong to every other State
in the Union, Nevada alone excepted.

Do not ask that this inequality be exagger-
ated. Do not impose upon us heavier bur-
dens. Concede to the great States which bear
the burdens of the Republic the poor boon
that no new badges of inferiority be placed
upon them.
These Territories asking to be made States
do not mean to aggravate this inequality.
The report of the Committee on the Territories,
which is the only plea in their behalf yet pre-
sented, depicts in bright colors the growth and
prosperity of Colorado. Concede it. The
estimate of present population is, like all west-
ern estimates, generous ; like all estimates of
numbers, untrustworthy. Doubts of the cen-
sus have been raised elsewhere, but investiga-
tion has not justified them. Territories may
lose as well as gain. Mr. Bowles, in "Across
the Continent," shows that Colorado lost be-
tween 1860 and 1865 from five to ten thousand
inhabitants; its apparent growth from 1860 to
1870 was only from 34,277 to 39,864, or six-
teen percent., a less ratio than even that of
Massachusetts (18.38) or of Maryland (19.74)
in the same period. For Utah not. one word
has been said. I cannot believe it is neces-
sary to dwell on the special objections to its
admission, beyond the general considerations
now urged. The conscience of members may
be trusted on this matter.
Grand natural features do not attract per-
manent population. You may tell me of the
glorious mountains and grand parks of Col-
orado. You may point to the twin peaks of
the Wahsatch, overlooking Utahâ€”icy, chaste
preachers and illustrations of monogamy.
The Alps do not surpass them. Switzerland
may rival with different grandeur, but teaches
