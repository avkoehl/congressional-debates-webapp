General McLAWS:

Just received following from Numbers 7:

The scouts from up the railroad left Millen at 6 o'clock this morning. They heard the drums of the enemy at 8. 30. Mr. Heard, agent at this place, went to within one mile of Millen at 9 o'clock. The enemy then occupied that place. Three scouts are now coming down the Middle Ground road with dispatches from Colonel Johnson. Will report as soon as they arrive.

Numbers 7, CENTRAL RAILROAD, December 2, 1864.

Major-General McLAWS:

At 10 o'clock this a. m. a body of the enemy's cavalry occupied Millen. Colonel Johnson with some of his men and three scouts from this place were at the car-sheds when one of the enemy rode up, about 200 yards in advance. He was taken prisoner, and scouts report that he told Colonel Johnson that their infantry were just above the railroad bridge across Buck Head Creek, half a mile above Millen, and that a body of cavalry were going down the other side of the Ogeechee. Scout just returned from Clifton Ferry, about two miles above this place, reports that a small number [are] already across. He fired on one of their vedettes, and came in to report. He has just gone back for further information.

E. T. LUDWIG,

Operator.
