210                                     THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                        February 26,
of the State of Maine, he would not have regarded
the transaction as requiring, on his part, any re-
sort to foiee Each party claiming a right to the
territory, and hence to the exclusive jurisdiction
over it, it is manifest that, to pi event the destruc-
tion of the timber by trespassers, acting against
the authonty of both, and at the same time avoid
forcible collision between the contiguous Govei la-
ments during the pendency of negotiations con
cei ning the title, report must be had to the mutual
exercise of jurisdiction in such exticme cases, or
to an amicable and temporaiy ainngcment as to
the limits within whi< h it should be exercised by
each party The understanding supposed to ex-
ist between the United States and Gieat Britain
has been found heietofore sufficient for that pm
pose, and I believe will piove so hereifter, it the
paities on the fiontici, diieetly interested in the
question, are íespectively governed by a just
spnit of conciliation and foibtaianct If it shall
be found, as then is now reason to appiehend,
that thcie is, in the modes of conetiuitiíí fhat un

not to be reconciled, I sh ill not b s¡t ite to [no

I cannot allow myself to do ibt that the íesults

seasonably realized The parties more immcdi

only piove fatal to their present interests, but
would postpone, if not defeat, the attainment of
the mam objects which they have m view    The
very incidents which have recently occuired will
necessarily awaken the Governments to the im-
poitance of promptly adjusting a dispute, by
which it is now made manifest that the peace of
the two nations is daily and imminently endan-
gered This expectation is fui ther warranted by
the geneial forbearance which has hitherto char-
acterized the conduct of the Government and
people on both sides of the line In the uniform
patuotism of Maine, herattachmenttothe Union,
her íespeet foi the wishes of the people of her
sister States, of whose interest in he r welfaieshe
cannot be unconscious, and, in the solicitude felt
by the country at large for the pieservation of

As, however, the session of Congiess is about

as may be calculated to obviate the necessity of a

HOUSE OF REPRESEN TATIVES
I                   Tui sow, Vebraary 2G, 183')
Tht unfinishtd business of the morning hour
Í was tht  it poit of the st ltet committee on tin pub
li   1 mils, tin   question being on the amendment
of Ml     RoBFKTSOM
I Mi \ ELL said that there were but a few days
of tin st sston left (oi the tiansaction of business
mtlispt usable to the suppoit of the Govt mment,
that it wis now appaient that no action could be
hid dining this session, and lit would nottiespass
motín i moi ning upon the busnif ss of the nation,
1 tVi lie stated tht positions whuh induced him
to oppose tin íesolution, in addition to those ad-
v un ed on a formei diy. Fust that the public
luid , untlt r the deeds of cession, were setapait
ioi the p lyment of the nation il debt, which
amounted,   U   the   close of  the  wai, to eighty
' million lhat dt bt has been paid and if you
phase, by the proceeds of the public lands, oi
latht r the whole amount of the sales amounts to
j about one bundled and six million, out of which
amount about Unity million  has bten expended
I m surveying and paying all necessity expenses
uid sal uies But it must be ¡eeollected that tint,
funded debt was p ud as wt 1! out of the common
t easurt as the proeet ds of the public lands Sec-
ondly, th it, fiom the estimatt of the C ommis-
s out i of the Gt neial Luid Office, theie has been
ibout sixty million paid for tht pinchase undei
the treatit s vv ith Florida and Spam and the extm
guishmcnt of Indian titles That must be paid
bt fore the pioceedscan be diveited fiom then on-
I ¿mil puipose The money was taken out of the
public Ticisury to acquire these titles, and it
thereby became a part of the levtnue, and could
no nion   be applied   m diiti ibuhon than money
j nused from customs upon imports
Mi ~\ took a brief survey of the giounds as
signed, and finally closed with his objections to the
passage of the íesolution, because the state of the
Treasury would pot justify it, and because the
effect would be to raise the tariff, or a íesort to
direct taxation to make up the deficiency, which
he estimated to be ten million  or more, and
which, moreover, would fall heavily upon the
western States, as they weie theconsumers, and
paid the «faites in the end
[Mr Y 's speech in full will be published as soon
as it is prepared for the press ]
Mr WILLIAMS, of Kentucky, on the ground
of want of time to act deliberately upon the sub-
ject, moved to lay the report and resolutions upon
the table
Mr HAYNES asked the gentleman to with-
draw the motion to allow him to make a brief ex-
planation His position was a pecuhai one, for
hts constituency had been assailed by the gentle-
man fiom Virginia, [Mr RoBi-UTsoN,] and ho
wished to place himself right before the country.
Mr WILLIAMS, of Kentucky, declined
Mr WILLIAMS, of North Carolina, called
foi the yeas and nays, but they were refused,
and the whole subject was laid on the table with-
out a division
GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.
On motion of Mr CAMBRELENG,the House
then went into Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union, (Mi Bvnks in the chair,) and
lesumcj the consideration of the general appio-
ptiation bill
The question immediately pending was the mo-
tion of Mi Ogli. to strike out the appropriations
foi the blanch mints, and to devote asum of $600
to eath, foi il man to take ehaige of them.
Mi MONTGOMERY, who was entitled to the
flooi, addiessed the eommittt t against theamend-
ment, and espetially m íeplv to Mr Ogle's re-
inal ks last night
Mr JOHNSON, of Louisiana, also advocated
the piopnety of continuing the bianch mints.
Mr ROBLRISON sustained the amendment,
and said he should have moved it, or one similar
to it, had it not been moved by a gentleman
fiom the Noith He expiessed his surprise that
any southern man, opposed to the protection of
manuf letones, should support these branch man-
uf ictones for gold, when they had one before ca-
pablt of doinii all tin business of the country
j Mr DAWbON expiessed his surpiise at this
having been made by the advocates of the amend-
I mi nt a party measure, and no less so at an effort
to cut off, in its infancy, before it had scarcely
gone into opeiation, woiks like these He con-
finedhis rtmaiks to the bianch at Dahtonega, the
ntetssity of which he warmly insisted upon
Mi GR'VII VM was in favor of the continua-
tion of the branches
Mi   EVERETT thought this an improper oc-
c ision to abolish the bianch mints—that it should
be hi ought foi waid as a separate measure     On
■ such an occasion the aigument of the gentleman
from Pennsylv ima [Mi Ogle] would be entitled
j to great considei ition     He- thought, at least, it
i was an unsafe course to mttoduce subjects of
| legislition into appropuation bills   Solongasthe
i law establishing these mints remained, he thought
i that the annual appiO| nations for their support
I should be made      lie said this, although he had
voted against their est ibl sbmtnt     Many of his
fnends, howevei, voted foi   them, no doubt on
the giounel  on which they were  then, as now,
i idvocated—as a measure of protection to domes-
tic industiy     it was then, as  now, uiged that
then establishment would uiciease the value of
¡<old in the section of countiy where produced
On this point the Not h had  no constitutional
sciuples, and he was glad to find that, on that
occasion, none weie expiessed by the South    He
had voted against it pnneipally on  the ground
that the establishment of d ffeient mints tended
to pi oduee aval lation of value    He had thought,
to prtseive a perfect unity of value, theie shoultl
be but one mint
Mi  STANLY made a icply to Mr   Mont-
gomfiu, in opposition to the mint at Charlotte,
and thiew out an intimation that the pioeeedings
weie not very honestly conducted theie, paiticu-
itily m reference to the was age of gold, oi con-
tingent expenses
i     Mi   CAMBRELENG remarked that, strictly
speaking, this amendment was not in Older, be-
cause they could not repeal one law and ingiaft
another upon an appropriation
'     Mi   MERCER advocated the adoption of the
, amendment
