Can you let me have the Twelfth Regiment Louisiana Troops? If so, it can be stopped in time at Camp Moore. I have scarcely 1,500 men besides Bowen's brigade, which is required on the Amite. Has General Beall orders to join me?

Rumored that the enemy intend evacuating Baton Rouge. The absence of gunboats from this point gives color to the report. I shall soon know. If so, I shall prepare to move toward New Orleans.
