HDQRS. ROSS' BRIGADE, JACKSON'S CAVALRY DIVISION,Donahue's, Ga., July 16, 1864-11 a. m.

Brigadier-General JACKSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: Some of my scouts from the near of Sherman's army inform me that he is collecting supplies as rapidly as possible at Big Shanty. One division of cavalry is there as guard, and recruiting their horses for the purpose of pursuing any cavalry sent from this army to operate on the railroad. The force in my front on the river, I think, has retired, passing up the river toward Turner's Ferry. Scouts have crossed to learn more definitely of their movements. The right of their infantry is reported to be east of the road leading to Green's Ferry, or rather above that ferry.

I am, general, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General, &c.
