sylvama [Mr. Buchanan] triumphantly quoted a"
expression which has passed into a maxim, ' that
there is but one step from the sublime to the ridi-
ruloRs," and Applying it to tee object of th  pro-
posed reference, professed his unwillingness to

ih^ difficulty of e.ifoscins ih's restriction.   In his
; ew K will be totally íroperatue. Restrict the m-
sti'u ion s" >ou may, it will, a*, he contends, still
afford these lopns and accommodation?. Ail at-
empts to prevent it will b. merely futile. Why,
then, cavil at the absence of rssmcuons which he,
h mself admits w ill be; alue ess? The fact that it
is imposs ble to restrain a mon yed corporation
witnin the 1 m ts of its charier, it it be true, would
be an objection to the creation of any such corpo-
ration, but not, surel;, to the omission of a provi-
sion m its charter ch ch the objector himse'f de-
nounces asva'aeless The real security against
all such violations of ihe charter waa stated m the
open it a'gumen'. It consists in the fidelity of the
directory, in ihe cheeks which are created by the
adm nrstrauve orjanizition of the institution, in
the interest of the stockholders—emphatically m
th ■. la*i ronsidera ion Having legard to this, the
dnedors wi'l necessarily prefer real bu^insss paper,
and ¡his will be in sufficient quantity to employ a
much 'ai^er amotini ot means than this institution
will h.-iVJ at command. I refer on this point to the
very able and practical vr?w which has been taken
by the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr Rimmons,]
and, ctrengihened as my own conf lenons have been
hy his illusirction of this poiticnof the subject, I
discard all apprehension from this source.
The dea that this institution will, n its praci-
cal operM on, be «holly devoied to the purposes
of the specuhlor, still haunts the lmagtnanun of
t e Senator from Pennsylvania, and is presented
and reiter?ted in every stage of his remarks. I
wish I eou'd remove the Senaioi's apprehensions,
for I am sure they are honestly entertained. His
S',mpaihies are awakened for the mechanic and
retail dinler. They can obtain no accommodi-
tiors at such an institution. Why nit? If the
eou's' of their bus ness requires them lo draw a
bill ot ex-har-ge, or to purchase one ft r remittance,
th y will f I'd ihe -ame facilities as any other
clause ot ihe community. The spirit which pre
vails m such an nstitu ion iv interest, n t favor.
If the have agro' bill to sell, or money wnh
wh'ch lo hoy cne, they will be promptly attended
to. If the nature of their bu^u-ess does not lead
them *o deal in exihengc, they cannot of course
do buMre«s with this institution, because it is
limited by its charter to that particular dealing.
But is thi? a causi of "omplainf! The State banks
a>p open to them. Th° power to accommodate
th"m ha been denied t> this institution. You
mi 1*" ss well qt ■> nel with a mechanic of one par-
t'cilar ela^s, brcm c he could not furnish yon
wi h urti les which he did not make, but which
weye manufactured by anolhei.
The taine disturbing idea now presents itself m
aso'her form 'o the mind < f (he honorable Sena-
tci. A mere «p-ciiiator in Philadelphia «ay draw
a bill upon Cam'en, oi his prototype m the city
of New York may in lik° manner draw upon
jorisy City In th - parcr the institution pro-
posed lo he c eatel by this bill might deal, b-cause
tb/se vu'd be foreign bnl-, drawn by a ciuzen of
i o e Sia e upon the c t z >i tf ~ other. But a mer-
1 chant of Buffa'o, v.t'urg o i tt-p cit} of N'st York,
agpin>l p o'a'" aetuaby shipped theie tor his ac-
coun%eou 1 not draw a bill fir the puce°ds of
lhat produce which u„u'd be negotiate I m this in-
st' ut on. Sir, tht fact is truly stated. It is just
a  h> Senatoi froai Pennsylvania represer's it I
con*' 'a it m d cp humiliation of spirit. P>u> you
kt otr sir—all is ho hear me kcov—lha'I would
no' have had it so. I nought, carnes ly sought,
under the míluense rf a long cherished and abid-
ng eonvtclio", to hate a good o d-fs "ipnedBank

o the fiscal nece <anes of the Government, and at
t^e s"iiie time of ffforcfing leluf to all classes of
' or o ' zeis Wnat is mucn more important to
our censtiments to know than what my individual
wishes we e, is the fact that such was the fish and
he feeling of the Whig party in Corgress, and
that such, with -ome concessions to the abstrac-
tions wi'h which we had to dea', was the bill re-
ported by the former 'elect committee, at the head of
which was the Senator f om Kentucky, and passed
by b-ith Houses of C ngress Why was this
wish not realized? Why has tais bill been reported,
proposing  the   incorporation  of   an  institution
