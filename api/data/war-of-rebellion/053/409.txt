General Sweeny's command did not reach Quinn's Mill last night. I am informed by cavalry just in that they will probably not get there before to-night. Your orders to the two regiments were promptly sent forward. Will telegraph as soon as they are heard from.

Respectfully,

An extra is waiting at Collierville in accordance with your telegram of yesterday. The agent telegraphs me that he thinks the two regiments will not be there to-day. There is an ambulance train at Collierville asking for transportation to La Grange with 20 wounded men and 30 mules. Shall I ship them? What regiments are they that you wish sent to Corinth? Answer.
