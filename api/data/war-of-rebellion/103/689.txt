Brigadier General WILLIAM D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to request that if the Twelfth or Thirteenth Indiana Cavalry have not been sent away yet, that one of them be retained and sent to this place.

Brevet Major-General.
HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Gravelly Springs, Ala., February 10, 1865.

Captain ROBERT H. RAMSEY,Asst. Adjt. General, Department of the Cumberland, Nashville:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to inform you that no changes have taken place in the condition of my command since the major-general commanding started to Nashville. A rumor prevails among the people that only two of Hood's corps have gone to South Carolina, but I cannot trace it to any authentic source. I have started two scouts to Montgomery, and shall use every effort to obtain reliable information. The roads here are in a worse condition than I ever saw them. Please request General Thomas to issue an order requiring the immediate return from hospitals and detached duty [men] fit for active service that belong to cavalry regiments. They should be assembled at the Edgefield Depot, and thence sent to their regiments under proper officers. I am very anxious on the question of horses for Hatch's division, and hope something may be done to get them before the season for active operations is upon us. I cant' for the life of me see what General Canby can do with all the horses that are now being purchased in the West. If they will only let us get north of the Alabama River, I will agree to make no demand on the Cavalry Bureau for horses after our present wants are supplied.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.

Brigadier General WILLIAM D. WHIPPLE,Chief of Staff, Department of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: The inclosed communication has just been received from General Forrest.* It was brought into our picket to-day by the officer mentioned therein, but as its object is evidently for the purpose of obtaining information, I have made no written reply, but shall send a strong flag of truce under an intelligent officer to-morrow, with instructions to communicate with General Forrest or Colonel Galloway only, and say: First. The people of Northern Mississippi have already been granted the privilege of using the railroads unmolested for the purpose of transporting necessaries of life. The proposition to send guards under flag of truce cannot be admitted. If the people themselves cannot protect the trains they must cease to run, and the necessary steps will be taken
