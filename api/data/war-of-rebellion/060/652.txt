HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,March 7, 1864.

Brigadier-General MERRITT,

Commanding First Division, Cavalry Corps, Cupler:

Has the second reconnaissance you sent out returned as you? How far was it ordered to go? If it goes out enough there will be no necessity of sending out another force to find out about the smoke seen from Pony Mountain; otherwise, General meade directs that you sent you another force, which he says you must get together out of the force you have.

C. ROSS SMITH,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff, Cavalry Corps.

The second reconnaissance has not returned. It was sent out to beyond where the smoke is reported. I am satisfied it will give a full account of the country to the right.
