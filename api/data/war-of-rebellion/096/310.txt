Major-General SHERIDAN,

Winchester:

I am ordered West on special duty by General Grant, to be absent a month, if not longer. If you are willing I will leave General McCook in charge to do my work. The offices of Colonel Woolley, my provost-marshal, are very important. Secretary Staton consents to his accompanying me, and if you will do so I will be greatly obliged. Captain Wiegel, for a long time assistant provost-marshal, is posted and fully equal to the office. I will be ready to go as soon as I hear from you.
