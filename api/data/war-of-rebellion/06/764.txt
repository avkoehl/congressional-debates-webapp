NEW ORLEANS, LA., November 4, 1861.

Honorable J. P. BENJAMIN:

Will the Secretary of the Treasury allow us to use the Marine Hospital for military purposes? Shall I recognize foreign consuls?

M. LOVELL.

RICHMOND, VA., November 4, 1861.

General MANSFIELD LOVELL,

New Orleans, La.:

Foreign consuls are recognized by our Government in all commercial matters. What kind of military use do you propose to make of the Marine Hospital? Answer, and I will apply to the Secretary of the Treasury. I ordered 10 tons of saltpeter sent to you by express from the Augusta Arsenal.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Acting Secretary of War.

HUNTSVILLE, November 4, 1861.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War:

Orders have been received from General Bragg, saying by authority of the Secretary of War. Do these orders supersede the orders to report to General Sidney Johnston? Answer at once.

L. P. WALKER,

Brigadier-General.

RICHMOND, November 5, 1861.

General L. P. WALKER,

Huntsville, Ala.:

General Bragg was authorized to call down to the coast any organized regiments that he could arm until we are relieved from the alarm about the naval expedition. It is useless to keep your regiments idle in camp whilst waiting arms. As soon as General Johnston can arm them your brigade will be put on the march for his headquarters. General Bragg had arms enough of the sick on hand to arm two regiment's in Mobile and Pensacola, and for this reason was allowed to call them to his aid. I write you in full.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Acting Secretary of War.

HDQRS. DEPARTMENT ALABAMA AND WEST FLORIDA, Near Pensacola, November 5, 1861.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL C. S. ARMY,

Richmond, Va.:

SIR: From the delay in hearing from the enemy's fleet, which sailed south on the 29th ultimo, we infer it is intended for some point in the Gulf. With a view of being ready with all our available means, I have ordered General Walker to send one regiment of his command to Mobile and one here to be armed with the weapons of our sick. Colonel Deas' regiment and Colonel Beck's, already armed by private enterprise
