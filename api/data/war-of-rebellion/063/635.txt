LEWISBURG, ARK., May 17, 1864.

Captain C. H. DYER:

Captain Clear, Third Arkansas, whom I sent to Norristown, was in that vicinity last night. He was compelled to fall back. He reports from reliable source that Shelby's whole force, 5,000 cavalry, one battalion infantry, and four pieces artillery, is on the north side of river. The rebels have left Dardanelle. They behaved shamefully while there, robbing Union families and burning some houses.

Yours,

A. H. RYAN,

Colonel, Commanding.

LEWISBURG, May 17, 1864.

Generals STELLE and CARR:

Colonel Fuller, with about 200 of the Dardanelle forces, arrived this p. m. The line has been up since 4 o'clock, but we could get no reply from Little Rock operator. Do you wish this place held to the last? If so, I will have to have something to fight their artillery with. I have one 3-inch rifled gun, without horses or harness, and my number of positions within 400 yards to shell it out.

A. H. RYAN,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF LITTLE ROCK,Little Rock, May 17, 1864-11 p. m.

Colonel RYAN,

Lewisburg:

Press horses, wagons, and oxen at once to carry off your gun, if necessary. Do not let the enemy get your cannon or your carbines. The position is of no consequence compared with the arms and troops. I will do what I can to re-enforce you, but your must take care of yourself till re-enforcements can reach you. If the line holds I will telegraph again to-night. Keep strong pickets and patrols 7 miles out. Skirmish the enemy heavily if he advances, to give you time to draw off. He will not probably be able to reach you in force to-morrow.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LEWISBURG, ARK., May 17, 1864.

General CARR:

I will put the arms and ammunition on a flat, and start them down the river to-night. I will bring away nearly everything, unless pressed sooner than I expect. The cannon I will have to haul away by wagons.

Respectfully,

A. H. RYAN,

Colonel, Commanding.
