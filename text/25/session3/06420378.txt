Ho. or Ref£.
It! 'he course of this debate, we have been told
by the gentleman fiom Indiana [Mt Boon] that
the denunciations of the Whigs, their ones of
"corruption/' "corruption," remind him of the
shepherd boy in the fable, who deceived by ex-
claiming "wolf," " wolf," until no one paid, the
least attention to the sound If I remember the
fable aright, the sheep were devomedat last by
neglecting the warning. With a proper appli-
cation of the nioral of the whole story, the people
should at least learn caution, and look to their
affairs, even if the sentinel should sometimes give
a false alarm. The gentleman says the people
wtU not and do not believe the cry, and he exulted
m their unbelief. We are taught in sacred placeB
that a want of faith is a damning sin. I call upon
the people to examine the evidences, to look into
the facts upon which we raise the cry of political
coiruption. Let them do that, and, if they will,
I am greatly mistaken if they do not perceive,
not one wolf coming, but an army of wolves al-
ready devouring their substance. If the people
ought to have faith, and have it not, they must
take the consequence of their unbelief, they must
penah—there is no salvation for them.
I know, sir, it is very difficult to secure the con-
siderate attention of a man, oí toreasen with him,
when you wish to eradicate luseirorsand preju-
dices     He arms himself against your fiist ap-
pioaches, and he sets up his passions as an im-
penetiable wall of piotection     He hates you
He will not sacrifice his vanity, his < oiisisttncy,
his infallibility, his self-love, so fai as to be con-
vinced by you    Convei t a political zealot' Why,
sir, the thing is next to an impossibility     I would
almost us soon undcitake to convince a Moimon
that then new lovclation fiom Heaven wasnoth
nig but tlit tuck of an artful knave, oi  to sive
the victim of supeistition and ldolatiy fiom self-
ímmolatioii under the cai of Juggernaut, 01 to ar-
rest the ciusades sot on foot by Pctei the Hermit
Reason cannot stand up against a huiricaue of
ptssion     I have no hope of converting the gt n-
tleman fiom Indiana     He is seaud by unbelief
He is like the last man who perished m the flood,
who,  standing  tiptoe  upon   the mountain   top,
with the water up to his  chin, addicssed Noah,
as the ark floated  by, " Ride on, my old boy, I
don't believe theie will be uiuih of a stmm aim
all."   I know, su, that a man's tune und biealh
are wasted mallempts to reason eoolly with heated
vpalots about anything    And in the days that
aie gone, when files mid drums and the filing of
cannon on tin  8th of Junuaiy were iisoittd to
as appiopílate mums to excite the passions, and
to suppiess the suggestions of the undcistanding,
it wus in vain to talk about tiampling constitu
tions and |aws under foot     Hundicds and thou
sands  would not listen      But those days  have
passed by, and I  trust we shall nevei see their
¡ike again     We never shall, if hibtory makes the
propei  impressions by hei teaching     The last
bth  of January passed away as silently as the
falling metcoi     1 ie|oice in theviUoiy of that
day as much as any man, but I have lamented in
bitterness that itsgloiy has been piostituted to
cieate a Ituzzasentiment, justifying the Gencial in
setting tin  Constitution and laws of his country
at defiance     Since Gtneial Jackson was  fust
elected, the boys of eleven and twelve y< ni í have
giown up tobe votéis    They will icasoii in look
ing upon past tiansactions which oecuned when
they were too young to have then picjudiccs and
passions enlisted by being actois and voters
And notwithstanding  the  asseveiitions of the

has taken occasion, in the eouise of tins dibate,
to complain ul (as he lias been pleased to term it)
the " cruel and outrageous" course pursued on
this floor towards the Administration and us
friends,- ia the cry of " corruption '" "corrup-
tion '" Sir, J am glad to hear the gentleman com-
plain. There is hopeof reformation where there
is sensibility left I only regret that, while he was
rebuking us, he did not remember the course of
his own associates, and bring theni in to share in
the benefits of his lecture Has he forgotten the
charges made against thepurestand best patriots
of the land—that they were the bribed tools of
the Bank of the United States, laboring for cor-
rupt wages' Does he not read the daily outpour-
ings of the official oigan, whose chief means of
defending its cause consists in afathomless reser-
voir of fetid water, and unprincipled efforts to
sprinkle it in the path of truth and patriotism, in
the hope that their votaries may be induced to
veer about in oider to avoid the stench? Let the
gentleman first pluck the beam out of his fuends'
eyes before railing at the mote in the eyesof those
who may not listen so kindly to his aduce I
deprecate as much as any one the party denun-
ciations and pohuealslandeisof the times I have
always set my face against them, but no one
should bedetencdfiom speaking what he believes
to be the truth fiom the fear of being gazetted, or
sf having hie motives assailed by those who wish
to use by piostrating others I should rejoice to
see the disgiaceful war of vitupeiation come to
an end Thi gentleman and the Administiation
he sustains may do much to bring about that le-
sult, by cleansing the oflicial oigan, and I should
be glad if then fust effoits would take thatdnec-
tion One of the leforms 1 desire to make is, to
sever the connection between the pationage of
the Government and the paity pi ess Itisapait

PL «L1C 1)1 I AULTERS
SPEECH OF HON   S   S. PRENTISS,
or Mississippi,
In Tiir House of Rfprdsentatives,
Deccmbet 28, 1833
The House bring in tho Committee of the Whole on the
suite of the Union, and having under constdeiation the
I'rcsidtiil s lUcssi^p—
Mi PRENTISS, of Mississippi, said
Mi Chairman I had intended, upon a foimer
occasion, to have cxpiessed my views uponsome
of the topics embraced in the Piesident's mes-
sage, moie especially the subject of the íecent
defalcations I am, howevei, so unfortunate as
to be viewed by the official eye of this House
thiou^h an inveited telescope, and it is not often
that 1 tan obtain thcilooi With much pleasuie,
tbdcfnc, I avail myself of the opportunity at
piesent afloidod me That poition of the mts
ss.ee to which I shall puncipally tuin my atten
tion, to wit, the defalcations of the public officeis,
has been aheadv ably considered bymyfnend
fiom Virginia, [Mr Wise,] as well as by the dis-
tinguished membei from Tennessee, [Mr Bell ]
But it is a subject which cannot be too often oi
too thoioughly discussed Its examination will,
1 am confident, eviscerate moie of the punciples
upon which this Government ha3 foi someyeais
been admimsteied, and furnish us more valuable
lessons foi future guidince than any other mat
tei that can occupy oui deliberations I am son y
to observe aiapidlymci easing hostility upon this
flooi to the discussion of great political princi-
ples One would suppose, in listening to some
gentlemen, that Congiess was constituted, like a
county couit, foi the ttial of petty individual
claims, instead of being the great political tribu
na' of the nation, whose province and duty it is
not only to notice all impoitant events in the
action of the Government but to investigate the
causes from which they have lesulted
Defalcations of the most alarming character,
and for an immense amount, cained on and con-
cealed for a series of years by the collector of the
principal commercial city of the Union, have
been recently developed The President has seen
fit to cajl oui particular attention to this case, and
to make, in connection therewith, divers sugges-
tions as to the best mode of preventing similar
occurrences hereafter
" It seems proper [«ays the President] that, by an early
enactment similar to that of other countries, the application
of public money by an officer of the Government to pnvate
Uses, should be made a felony, and visited with severe and
ignojnmous punishment "
He further recommends that a committee of
Congress be appointed to watch the officeis who
have the custody of the public moneys, and that
they should " report to the Executive such de-
falcations as were found to exist, with a view to
a prompt removal from office, unless the default
was satisfactorily accounted for "
The Secretary of the Treasury has also given
us a report upon this same subject, in which he
expresses his astonishment that such an occur-
rence should have happened without his knowl
edge, exhibits, like the Piesident, a most holy
hoiror at the enormity of the offense, and lecom-
mends the appointment of an additional tube of
officers to watch ovei those already in power, as
the best mode of avoiding similai mishaps in
futme
To listen to the well issumed astonishment of
the Piesident and Secietaiy at the  di>>covety of
Swartwout's pcculitions, one u ould lejdily sup
pose that dc falcation.undci tho present Adimnis
tration, like pamcide  among the ancients, had
heietoforc been  a dime unknown, and  conse
quently unpiovidcd foi by pistic        Hcnilan to
the philosophical musings of the Piesident on this
point
" I he Govtmtncnt, it must be idimtted, has been fiom
us commencement compnauvily tnrtutmi in tlm ic ptct
Hut Ui« appointing power oannot limy be w II ndvi d
in its selections, and the experience ot every country Ins
show u that public officers aie not at all units proot a0ain t
temptation   '
Wondt i ful sagacity ' Unpaialleled discovery '
Who will now deny the title of " magician ' to
the man who has developed the astounding fact
" that public officers are not at all times pioof
against temptation '"
The embezzlements of Swartwout have caused
this tiuth to flash upon the sagacious mind of the
Chief Magistiate, and with philanthropic eager-
ness he íeeommends that we put a stop to this
new sort of wickedness by making it a peniten-
tial y offense
Mr Chairman, if I should tell you that all this
is sheet hypocnsy—gross and miseiable pretense
—a tub thrown out to amuse the popular whale,
and divert his attention from the miseiable and
leaky canoe which bears the fortunes of this Ad-
ministration, if I should tell you that, duung the
last five or six years, a hundied cases of defalca-
tion have occurred, more outrageous in principle,
more piolligate in character, than the one we aie
lecommended to investigate, that the Piesident
has continued defaulters in office, knowing ot
their violations of duty, knowing of their appro-
pn-Uionof the public moneys to pnvate uses, lliat
the Secietary of the Treasury has, duung that
whole penod, habitually connived at these defal
cations, and extended over them the mantle of
his protection, if I should tell you that these de-
falcations constitute a portion ot the " spoils sys-
tem"—that system which has been to this Admin-
istiation what his flowing locks were to Samson
—the secret of its strength, if I should tell you
all this, I should tell you no moie than I consci-
entiously believe, no more than I shall attemp*
to prove before this House and the countr>
These defalcations I shall tiace to their origin, an
not stop to inquiie so much into their amounts,
as into the causes which have led to them It is
not the question, where is the money? but wheie
is the guilt> that I wish to investigate The
íecent developments to which oui attention is in-
vited are but some of the bubbles that aie every
day bieaking upon the suiface of the still and
mantling pool I shall not stop to measuie their
íelaave size or co'oi, but will, unpleasant as the
task may be, diedge foi the corrupt cause which
lies at the bottom   These cases are but the wind-
