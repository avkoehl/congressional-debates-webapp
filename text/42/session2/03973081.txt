I, i Thus we see that the aggregate increase
, 'of the State indebtedness of these eleven States
is largely in excess of the startling sum of
( $200,000,000. Nor does this include county
and municipal indebtedness. All this under
L- Radical rule: and yet thepeople must not com-
plain. All this lime they have been ruled.by
men—carpet-baggers—men who have no inter-
'• est in those States except to rob and plunder.
I ask all the just men on this floor, and the
.'"people of the northern States, what would
Vyou do under such circumstances? Will you
:: not rise up and assist your brethren of the
•;South to rid themselves of this wholesale rob-
, bery and plunder? You owe it to yourselves,
'.to humanity, to civilization, to Christianity.

" .people under the operations of the suspension
• of the writ of habeas corpus, what are they
i suffering in other parts?
Bead the following letter from the United
■States attorney at Galveston, Texas, to the
. Attorney General of the United States, (Execu-
tive Document, 268,) and then tell me if your
Mood does not curdle, and should we not hang
our heads in shame. That officer says:
Office of United States Attorney,
Eastern District of Texas,
U. S. Coukt-Rooms, February 10,1872.
Right here in Galveston, or at Houston, Austin,
San Antonio, or any ot the larger towns in thickly
settled districts, we are as secure as in New York
or elsewhere. That is one of the necessary results
of American civilization. Vagrancy, drinking,
gambling, and laziness trouble us right here con-
siderably, and is confined ehipfly to the colored
element. But it is upon the Rio Grande and Red
.river frontiers that our people suffer indescribable
woes from robberies and murders.
Mexicans and Indians on the Rio Grande, and
: - reserve Indians on the Red river border, are daily
.committing thefts, robberies, and murders, that not
only prevent increase of population, but put out
the liglit of civilization. Whole families are mur-
dered, their corpses mutilated in a manner too hor-
rid for mention, bouses burned, farms destroyed,
cattle driven off, little boys find girls carried into
oaptivity worse than death, the country impover-
- ished, and all settlement and progress prevented.
The Indians are fed upon tho reserve by the
Government, and cross the Red river into Texas
on their raids. But you can form no true idea of
their work till you meet corpses of peaceful citizens
hacked, ripped, scalped, and then roasted in chains
fastened to the wheels of a burning wagon; till
you see the widowed mother and the orphan chil-
dren, made by Indians fed and nurtured by the
-Government upon tho reservations.
' I have myself, within the past few months, seen
women living with the third husband, the two pre-
vious ones having been murdered by Indians of the
reserve.
1 have stood upon the bank of the Rio Grande at
.-Brownsville and have seen thousands upon thou-
.sands of dried beef hides with the brands of pro- .
minent Texans upon them, the cattle having been
stolen by Mexicans and driven across the Rio
Grande, prepared for market, and then shipped in
bond for New York. The owners of the stolen
cattle seeing their hides pass under their very noses
are unable to stop them by any attainable legal
process, because they are in possession of Federal
customhouse officials in, transitu for delivery at
Hew York.
These robberies are constantly occurring. I see
bo way of securing safety to the frontier people
north than to put every Indian on a reserve, and
keep him there, and if he goes off without a proper
pass, to kill him as you would a wolf or a panther.
The savages on the northern border only differ
from the savage beasts in that they are more intelli-
gent and capable and more disposed to do harm.
The wolf kills to satisfy his hunger: the Indian
wars against civilization itself. He is opposed to
the cultivated field, the farm-house, the school-
house, and tho church; he murders the civilized
men, violates and murders the women, and takes
the little boys and girls and makes savages of them.
He slaughters,_ murders, mutilates, rapes, robs, de-
vastates. He is opposed to settlement; he would
have the magnificent country of northern Texas
remain a howling wilderness and unbroken prairie.
Civilization is something that interferes with his
savage dignity. He feeds upon the bounty of the
nation, and gains strength to murder and rob the
people of the frontier, which he does for pastime
and amusement.
The cases of Santanta and Big Tree, convicted in
July last at the court in Jack county (Fort Richard-
son) for the murder of seven teamsters belonging
to Henry Warren's train of wagons loaded with
Government provisions, is in point.
Should you desire specific cases in detail of the
regular robberies and thefts of cattle on the Rio
Grande, I can furnish you with the names of promi-
nent and worthy citizens who will tell; or, if time
were given, I could give it myself.
The most provoking feature of it all is that the
people who suffer most in these exposed places are,
and ever have been, the firmest in their devotion to
the nation during the war.
If Congress do not intend to abandon the frontier
of the Government on the northern or Red river
border, they had better put ten cavalry regiments
where they now have but one.
Again listen to what appears in a morning
paper of the 8d instant:
"Ke\v Okleans, May 2.
"A Picayune special from San Antonio, Texas,
says: 'A Gonzales train of six wagons, seventy-five
mules, nine men, and two women, was captured by
Indians at Howard Well, above Fort Ciark. The
train and hands were captured, and all burned ex-
cept one woman, who escaped. She says the Indians
numbered a hundred and fifty. General Merritt
sent Lieutenant Vincent with cavalry in pursuit,
who overtook and fought them, losing his life. This
news was received by the El Paso stages.'"
The same cry of blood, rapine, and murder
of our fellow-citizens is wafted to us from
every quarter—from the western plains, from
Arizona, and New Mexico.
Where is our Army that has cost and is
costing us so many millions every year? They
are arresting our white biethren in the South
under the operations of the suspension of the
writ of habeas corpus. Oh, shame, where is
thy blush ! You, gentlemen on this floor from
the northern States, will you not stop talking
about protective tariffs, mail steamship subsi-
dies, incorporation of railroads, making rail-
road grants—one day voting away a public
park to a railroad worth §250,000 and the
next voting $400,000 to purchase another
piece of ground near the Capitol, perhaps in
the future to be disposed of in a like man-
ner? Will you not stop for awhile to serve
the dead and dying? Will you not listen to
the protestations of men being robbed of their
property? Will you not listen to the helpless
cries of men, women, and children ? I appeal
to you, gentlemen of the North, for the rea-
son that our southern brethren are prostrate.
They are helpless; their voices are as silent as
the tomb. It'they attempt to help themselves
the cry of Ku Klux is raised against them.
Why, but yesterday the Delegate from Mon-
tana made an appeal to us for help from the
scalping-knife of the Indians of Montana, and
by resolution we authorized the arming of the
citizens with Government arms. Again I
ask, where are our soldiers? Why do we
spend these millions a year for the War De-
partment? And this is the administration
that asks to be kept in power.
The picture is heart-rending and heart-sick-
ening. I turn from it in disgust, with loathing
for its perpetrators and sympathy for the suf-
ferers. May God in His infinite wisdom, good-
ness, and omnipotence relieve them from their
bondage and suffering I This Administration
has not only collected from the people these
thousands of millions of dollars, those hun-
dreds of millions more than the whole national
debt was at its maximum; it has not only
voted millions for subsidies and collected mil-
lions more from the toiling and sun-burnt
masses in the shape of a tariff to build up
manufactories in the East, and voted $250,000
to pay some of the incidental expenses of the
much-boasted Washington treaty, from which
it has ignominiously backed down, and $50,000
to feast the Japanese, and, as I said before,
on one day gave away to a railroad company
a public park worth $250,000, and a few days
after voted $400,000 to buy another piece of
ground ; but in the last few years, as shown by
official reports, it has given away one hundred
and seventy million acres of land to railroad
companies and States for railroad purposes,
which is land sufficient to make five such
States as the great State of Ohio. One hun-
dred and thirty-three million nine hundred
and ten thousand acres of this land, as shown
by the report of the Secretary of the Interior,
dated January 10, 1872, has gone to the vari-
ous Pacific railroads alone. This Administra-
tion has not only given to these railroad com-
panies these millions of acres of land, but
also issued its bonds, bearing six per cent,
interest, for $04,623,512 for the same purpose,
which are yet outstanding. Nor is this all;
the Government has paid the interest on these
bonds amounting to ¥14,031,870 18. It is true
that $3,611,152 09 has been returned to the
Government in the way of transporting mails,
which still leaves a balance of $11,020,718 09
of interest paid by the Government. Add
the principal and interest together, and we
have in addition to the 133,910,000 acres
given to these railroads, the aggregate sum
of $75,644,230. All of the foregoing is shown
in the monthly statement of the Secretary of
the Treasury. No wonder various State Legis-
latures are passing resolutions against such
proceedings, and urging Congress to preserve
these lands for homesteads. This Administra-
tion, the party in power, will not heed the
monitions. We must judge the future by the
past. What is the value of these land grants?
In a circular which I have before me issued
by Jay Cooke & Co., who are the agents of
the United States, and ofte of the wealthiest,
most reliable banking houses in the United
States, issued January, 1872, that house says
that the average price at which the twenty-live
leading land-grant railroads have thus far sold
their lands is $7 04 per acre, the highest aver-
age of any grant being $13 98, and the lowest
$3 07. Taking the average of $7 Oiperacre,
and this banking house says in its circular as
agent for selling the bonds of the Northern
Pacific railroad, that the lands thus granted
to the Northern Pacific railroad "will yield
$161,000 per mile, more than three times the
possible cost of construction and equipment."
Now, according to the estimate of said
banking house of the average price at which
these lands will be sold, $7 04 per acre,
there has been given to the Pacific railroad
in corporations alone in lands $934,670,000,
and in bonds and interest paid on those
bonds, $75,644,230, making in the aggregate
the sum of $1,110,314,230! nearly one half
of the present debt of ihe United States;
in comparison with which all other com-
panies or incorporations, ancient or modern,
dwindle into insignificance ; and in fifty years
from now their wealth will be beyond the
imagination of man, and their combined
power and influence (and it is to make the
combination,) will be beyond that of kings or
emperors. No wonder, after this example,
that those in high places should be foad of
receiving presents. Oh, that our present
