[General PRICE:]

GENERAL: Maury has just left my quarters. I gave him orders to have his mounted Texas brigade gotten in readiness to march to-morrow morning to Tobytubby Ferry, below here. The enemy are moving out from Memphis, 2,000 infantry, 500 cavalry, and battery of artillery. May be only advance guard. They encamped last night 12 miles from Hernando. The mounted infantry will best come in play on this occasion.

Respectfully,

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.
