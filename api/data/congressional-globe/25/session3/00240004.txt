noi cai a sincere solicitude foi the success of all

quence,to the wai which is waj;cd m Us sup

wi'l show tie giounds upon v/hiclt we contend
that tne citizens of tí e United States have, inde-
pendent of the piovmjns of the cumtn'i j,i of
1824, a right to trade with the natives upon the
coast m question, at unoccupied places, liable,!
however, it is admitted, to be at any time extm- I
guislied by the creation of Russian establishments 1
at such points    This right is denied by the Rus-
sian Government, w'ueh asseits that, by the op-
eiation of the tieaty of 1824, each paity agreed
to wane the general light to land on the vacant
coasts on the 1 spective sides of the degree of latí
tude íeferrod to, andacc pted, in lieu thereof, the
mutual privileges mentioned in the fourth aiticle
The capital and tonnage employed by our citizens
in their trade with the northwest coast of America
will, ptihaps, on advening to the official state
me its of the commerce and navigation of the
United States for the last few years, be deemed
too inconsumable in amount to attract much at-
tention, yet the subject may, 111 other respects,
deserve the caieful consideiation of Congress
1 regret to state that the blockade of the prin-
cipal poitson the eastern coast of Mexico, which,
in consequence of diffeienees between that Re
public and Fiance, was institu'ed 111 May last,
unfoiInnately still continues, enfoiced byacom-
petent French naval foice, and is necessarily em-
banassing to oui own tiade 111 the gulf, 111 com-
mon with thatofothci nations Eveiydisposition,
howevei, is belli ved to exist on the pait of the
Fiench Government to render this measure as
little oneious as piacttcable to the interests of the
ciurens of the United States, and to those of neu-
tial eommeice, and itis to b hoped thataneaily
settli ment of the difficulties between Fiance and
Me\ico will soon leestablish the harmonious re
lations fonnrily subsisting between them, and
again opi 11 the poits of that Republic to the ves-
sel   of all friendly nations
A convention for m irking that pait of the
boundaiy between the Uniud States and the Re-
public ot fc\is which extends fiom the mouth
of the Sabine to th( lied uvi 1, was concluded and
si,ntd at this city on the 25th of Apnl last It
has since been unified by both Governments, and
s asonablt me-sures will be taki n to cany it into

01 expedient, in 1 elation to either of them
To watch ovei and fostei the interests of a grad-
ually incieasing and widely extended commerce,
to guaid the lights of Ami rican citizens, whom

vate those sentiments of mutual respectand good
will whir Ii evpeinnee has pioved so beneficial 111
lutein itional intcieoursi, the Government of the
tlmti d States lias deemed it expedient, fiom time
to time, to establish diplomatic connections with
difkicnt foreign States, by the appointment of
íepiesi ntatives to íeside within their respective
terntoiies I am giitified to be enabled to an-
nounce to you that, smce the close of your last
sission, tlnse íelations hate been opened under
the hippiest auspices with Austria and the Two
Sicilies, that new nominations have been made
in the respective missions of Russia, Binzil, Bel-
gium, and Swedtn and Noiway, m tmscountiy,
and that a Minister Extiaoidinary has been re
ceiud, accredited to this Government fiom the
Aigentine Confederation
An exposition of the fiscal affairs of the Gov-
ernment, and of their condition for the past year,
will be made to you by the Secretary ofthe Treas-
uiy
The available balance in the Treasmy, on the
1st of January next, is estimated at $2,765,343
The receipts ofthe yeai fiom customs and 1 tnds,
will prooably amount to |20,615,o98 The.e usu-
al sourees ot íevenue have been increased by an
issue of Trt asm/notes—if win h Ies3 than tight
million dollars, including mteiestatid principal,
will be outstanding at the end of the ytai-—and
by the sale of one of the bonds of the Panic of the
United States, ior $2,2o4,871 The aggregate of
means fiom these and othersomces, witn unbal-
ance on hand on the 1st of Januaiy last, has been
applied to the payment of appiopnations by Con
giess The whole expenditure for the yeai on
their account, including the redemption of more
than eight millionTieasuiy notes, constitutes an
aggregate of about foity million dolíais, and wdl
sail leave in the Tieasuiy tht balance before
stated
Nearly e ght million dolíais of Treasuiy notes
are to be paid during the coming yeai, 111 addition
to the ordinary appropriations for the support
of Government Foi both these purposes,tbe
resources of the Tieasury will undoubtedly be
sufficient, if the charges upon it aie not increased
beyond the annual estimates No exci ss, how-
ever, is likely to exist, noi can the postponed
installment of the surplus íevenue be deposited
with the States, noi any considerable appropn
ations beyond the estimates be made, without
causing a defieiency in the Treasui y The great
caution, advisable at all times, of limiting an-
propnations to the wants of the public service,
is rendered necessary at piesent by the pios-
pectiveand 1 tpid 1 eduction ofthe tariff, while the
vigilant jea'ousy, evidently excited among the
people by the occuircnces of the last few years,
assures us that they expect fiom their repiesent-
atives, and will sustain them in the exercise of,
the most ngid economy Much can be effected
by postponing appiepilations not immediately
required foi the oidmery public seiviee, 01 for
any piessing emeigency and much by íeducing
the expenditures wheie the entne and immediate
accomplishment of the objects in view is not in-
dispensable
When we call to mind the íecent and extreme
embaaassments pioduced by excessive *ssues of
bank papei, aggiavated by the unfoieseen witl -
diawal of much foieign capital, and the inevitable
deiangcment ausing from the distribution ofthe
suiplus revenue among the States, as lequued bv
Congiest, ind considt i the heavy exnenses 111
cuned by the removal of Indian tribes, by the
mtlitai y operations in Florida, and on account of
the unusually large apprnpnitions made at the
last two annual sessions of Congress foi other
objects, we have stnking evidence, in the present
etfieient state of om finances, ofthe abundant re-
souices of the counti v, to fulfill all its obligations
Nor is it less giatifying to find that the geneia!
business of the community, deeply affected as it
hes been, is íeviving with additional vigoi, chas-
tened by tne lessons of the past, and animated by
the hopes of the futuie By the curtailment of
paper issues, by cuibmg the sanguine and adven-
tuious spnit of speculation, and by the honorable
application of all available means to the fulfillment
of obligations, confidence has been íestoied both
at home and abioad, and ease and facility secured
to all the opeiations of tiade
The agency of the Government in pioducing
these íesults 1 as been as efficient as its powers
and means peimitted By wit! holding fiom the
States the deposit of the fouith installment, and
leaving several millions at long credits with the
banks, pnncipdly in one section ofthe country,
and moie immediately beneficial to it, and,at the
same time aiding the banks and commercial com-
munities 111 other sections, by postponing the pay
ment of bonds foi duties to the amount of betvv een
fourand five million dolíais, by an issue of Tieas-
uiy notes as a means to enable the Government
to meet the consequences of their indulgences,
but affording, at the same time, facilities foi íe-
mittance a id exchange, and by steadily declining
to employ as general depositories of the public
revenues, oí íeceive thenotes of all banks which
refused to redeem them with specie, by these
measures, aided by the favorable action of some
ofthe banks, and by the support andeooperatior
of a
uortion of the community, we havs
witnessed an early resumption of specie payments
in our gieat commercial capital, promptly foi
I lowed in almost eveiy part of the TJni'ed States
! Ihis result has been alike salutary to the true in
teresis of agriculture, commerce, and manufac
tuies, to public moial«,iespect for the laws, and
that confidence between man and man which is so
essential m all our social relations
