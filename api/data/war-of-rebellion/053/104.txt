HEADQUARTERS SIGNAL CORPS,October 5, 1863-9.30 p.m.

Captain THOMS:

I have heard no guns. The officers on this station say they heard two reports, and supposed them to be our own guns, in the direction of the fort on Rossville road, occupied by General Negley's troops.

Yours, respectfully,

JESSE MERRILL,

Captain and Chief Signal Officer.

STATION NEAR LOOMIS' BATTERY,

October 5, 1863.-10.30 p.m.

Captain MERRIL:

From fort occupied by General Wood's division I observed a great many rebel camp-fires on Missionary Ridge, on crest, side, and at base. Immediately in front of where large gun is mounted there were no fires for a mile in extent along the ridge, but many to the right and left. Those on the left are brighter and more scattered than those on the right, but not so numerous. At two places on the right the fires were arranged in order of camp, in one place forming three sides of a parallelogram. These fires extended well round to the south. I also heard wood-chopping in rebel lines in front of Fort Wood. The artillery firing was from Lookout Mountain; I think from the battery which fired last at Fort Negley. No fires on Lookout Mountain.

HOPKINS.

The following report from station near Loomis' battery has just been received:

Captain MERRILL:

The firing is again from Lookout Mountain from same place. Could trace the shell through the air; it seems to have been fired at Fort Negley. Nothing else unusual.
