WASHINGTON, D. C., May 11, 1863.

Major-General BANKS, Comdg. Dept. of the Gulf:

GENERAL: The President and Secretary of War have read your dispatch No. 11, of April 23, with great satisfaction. The operations of your army have been truly brilliant and merit high praise.

The Quartermaster-General has sent you additional steam transportation to supply your present wants, and it is hoped you will unite with General Grant so as to attack Vicksburg and Port Hudson separately.

If within your power to operate between the two places, and with your combined strength to attack a divided enemy, your success will be almost certain. By attacking Port Hudson from below or Vicksburg from above you enable the enemy to unite his forces upon the point attacked.

General Hooker failed to accomplish his object south of the Rapahannock through the bad conduct of one of his corps and crossed to the north side without any disaster. The loss of the enemy was very much greater than ours.
