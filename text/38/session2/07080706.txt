Mr. BALDWIN, of Mu ssachu'setts, (ata quar-
ter past one o'clock, a. m.) It isovident that there
is something at fault in the rules of the Iloum*; that
something more is requited in order to enforce
the duty of membets to he present when the
House is in session. Some members evidently
feel too lightly that obligation. Thorefoi e, in view
of this evident defect in the rule:;, which nmk<\s
it hopeless to attempt to uceump'. -h an) <h.;j- hcic
to-night, j am disposed to move again that we
ndjourn. It does not annoy me to stay here late.
1 am accustomed to late hours. My habits in that
respect are such that 1 can sit out the night here
comfoitably; and I would do it gladly if there
were any good object before us that it would seem
possible ior us to accomplish. There being no
hope of reaching the object for winch we aie
snuggling, I again move that the House adjourn.
Mi. HiGBY. 1 hope the House will not
adjourn. I hope that some men of this House
who have been here and have left will be brought
here.
The question was taken; and the House re-
fused to adjourn.
i\Jr. WILSON". I hope as many members of
this side of the House will be brought in here as
have been brought in here of the other side, and
then we will have a quorum.
Mr. STEVENS. I hope those who have been
here and have left wili be first brought in.
Mr. GARFIELD. I move that the Sergeant-
at-Arms, Assistant Sergeant-at-Arms, the Door-
keeper, and Assistant Doorkeeper, be designated
as special messengers to bring in absent members.
Mr. WILSON. I move to amend by adding
that they be especially instructed to first arrest
and bring here those who have been here and have
left without leave.
The SPEAKER. The Chair doubts whether
the motion of the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Wil-
son] is in order. The order must be to arrest
absent members.
Mr. POMEROY. It is a matter of notoriety
to every man in the House that Mr. Parnsworth
of Illinois, Mr. Spalding of Ohio, Mr. Pike of
Maine, Mr. Dawes of Massachusetts, and Mr.
Webster of Maryland, who have been once
excused to-night upon the payment of the usual
fees—and I do not know but some others—have
been here and have left the House, some of them
saying emphatically that they would not remain
here to make up a quorum.
Mr. COX, (sotto voce.) Say that they said they
would be damned ifthey would stay. [Laughter.]
Mr. POMEROY. Well, I will not say what
my friend from Ohio [Mr. Cox] has said.
Mr. COX. 1 did not say it myself.
Mr. I50MER0Y. I think it is due to those
who are remaining here that those men should be
brought in here. I say it is an insult to the House
that those men should have left under the cir-
cumstances they did. 1 say the House cannot
maintain its own dignity properly unless these
men are first biought in.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will state that
four years ago, while acting as the Presiding
Officer pro tempore, during a call of the House in
an evening scmioh, he examined the authorities
upon this subject, and found no case where orders
have been specially given for members named to
be broui?h t in.
Mr. GARFIELD. I have no doubt that the
officers designated for this duty will carry out the
wishes of the House.
Mr. WILSON. I will state that my motion
to amend was intended rather as directory to the
Sergeant-at-Arms than for the action of the House.
I withdraw the motion to amend. I am informed
that the gentleman fiom Illinois has departed
from the Hall. If so, 1 wish that the Seigeunt-
at-Arms would pay particular attention to his
case.
Mr. POMEROY. The member from Illinois,
from the Galena district, [Mr. Wasiiburne.]
Mr. BROWN, of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker,
it will not be pretended, I suppose, that members
who have attended heie to-night until this late
hour should be punished for their punctuality;
and hence I think it proper that we should make
some piovision as to the time for the next meet-
ing of the House. It is very evident that we shall
not be in a condition to do anything to-morrow;
and therefore I move that when we adjourn it be
to meet on to-morrow, tiiat is,Satuiday. We
cannot, I believe, under the rules, adjourn over
until Monday.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman can move
to adjourn till Monday if a quorum is present.
This is Thursday's session.
Mr. BROWN, of Wisconsin. "We cannot ad-
journ till Monday without a quoium?
The SPEAKER. Not without a quorum.
Nor can \vc adjourn till Saturday without a quo-
in m.
Mr. BROWN, of Wisconsin. I prefer the mo-
tion as 1 slated it: that when we adjourn it be to
meet on to-morrow, or, in other words, on Sat-
urday.
The SPEAKER. In legislative parlance this
is Thursday, and will remain so even after twelve
o'clock noon, if the Ilouse should continue in
session.
Mr. BROWN, of Wisconsin. I call the atten-
tion of the Chair to the opinion of Hon. Thomas
Benton at the time when the House remained in
session until Sunday morning.
The SPEAKER. That opinion has been over-
ruled since. The Chair to-day looked at the Con-
gressional Globe in reference to that very point.
Volume forty-four of the Congressional Globe
shows that the Senate proceedings of Saturday,
Sunday, and Monday, March 2, 3, and 4, are all
recorded as of the legislative day of Saturday,
March 9, 1861.
Mr. MORRILL. Ifthereisnotaquorum,can
the motion of the gentleman from Wisconsin be
adopted ?
The SPEAKER. If there is no quorum, the
motion cannot prevail; and if there is no quorum,
the Chair is of opinion that the motion must be
reserved till a quorum appears.
Mr. MORRILL. 1 believe, Mr. Speaker, that,
by attempting to pursue this proceeding, we are
punishing ourselves more than the absentees. I
have had considerable experience of these pro-
longed night sessions. 1 know exactly how this
proceeding will result. I know that the absentees
cannot be brought here unless they choose to be
brought here. I know that they do not choose to
be brought here to-night, and that we shall sit
here till nine or ten o'clock to-morrow morning,
before we shall get their presence, and that the
absentees will have enough votes in the House to
excuse them; so that we cannot fine them.
Mr. WILSON. We will try it.
Mr. MORRILL. I have seen it tried over and
over again.
Mr. KASSON. I wish to inquire whether the
proceedings under the call cannot be continued if
we take a recess until quarter before twelve o'clock
to-morrow.
The SPEAKER. The Clerk will read the rule
on the subject.
The Clerk read, as follows, from page 35 of
Barclay's Digest:
u It is not in order for the House to take a recess during
a call of the House."
The SPEAKER. That is the only obstacle in
the way of the motion indicated by the gentleman
from Iowa, {Mr. Kasson.]
Mr. POMEROY. In answer to the remarks
of the gentleman from Vermont, [Mr. Morrill,]
I have this to say, that after sitting herefron nine
till one o'clock in order to get a quorum of the
House, if the House has not the power to com-
pel the attendance of the members necessary to
form a quorum, then the call of the House is a
faice. 1 maintain that it is due to the dignity of
this House that we should compel the attendance
here of all members who were present when the
call of the roll showed that there was no quorum
present, and to fine them in such a way as will
be a lesson to members hereafter. For one, I de-
sire that every man who was present when the
proceedings under the former call were dispensed
with shall be brought to the bar of the House and
properly punished. In my view it is the greatest
indignity that could be offered to this House for
members to leave under the circumstances under
which the men whose names I mentioned a little
while ago left this Hall. I am willing to sit here
forty-eight hours rather than permit them to
escape proper punishment.
Mr. ANCONA. Would it not be competent
for the House to impose the penalty suggested
by the gentleman upon delinquent members?
The SPEAKER. Notunless they nre brought
to the bar and asked to give reasons for their ab-
sence.
Mr. GARFIELD. I move to substitute in
place of the Door keeper, Mr. Goodenow,who 13
at home with a sick wife, Mr. John T. Chancy,
The SPEAKER. For what purpose ?
Mr. GARFIELD. To actas special messen-
ger for the arrest of absentees.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. TOWNSEND. I move that they be
brought here dead or alive. [Laughter.]
Mr. COX. 1 insist on a division of the mo-
tion. f
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I move to amend by strik-
ing out the words "and alive." [Laughter,]
The SPEAKER. The Chair regards the mo-
tion as not in order.
Mr. STEVENS. I ask to be excused from
further service during the remamderof this day's
session.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. COX. As the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania lias jetired, I think that we had better ad-
journ, as we have lost our head. [Laughter.]
Mr. HOLMAN. Was not a motion to ad-
journ until Saturday made?
