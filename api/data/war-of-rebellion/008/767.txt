Colonel, Commanding.

CAMP CLARKTON, MO., March 5, 1862.

Colonel JASON H. HUNTER, Camp Kitchen, Mo.:

DEAR COLONEL: I have got to this end of the road, but must go immediately to Jacksonport, and will not have the pleasure of seeing you. I desire that you should fall back to this place with your infantry, to assist in the organization down here, and also to assist to construct a work at this place for the defense of the plank road. I hope there will be no misunderstanding about the guns and the other things between Walker, Kitchen, and yourself, but that all things will go on harmoniously and brotherly. The balance of our force is at the other end of the plank road, but Ward's, Harris', Holmes', and Liles' infantry will be here to-day. There is not special news from Madrid. The enemy are there in force, but will not fight for a day or two.

Yours, &amp;c.,

M. JEFF. THOMPSON,

Brigadier-General, Missouri State Guard.

CAMP CLARKTON, March 5, 1862.

General J. P. McCOWN,

Commanding New Madrid, Mo.:

DEAR SIR: I find there are more none of the enemy on this side of the ridge, and the coast is entirely clear to Cape Girardeau. The force that was at Greenville some say [has gone] to Ironton, but the newspapers say it is for Pocahontas. I will start for Jacksonport in a few hours. I have placed the guns at Little River at Weaversville and I have two here, therefore the plank road is safe for the time being, and if any misfortune should happen, the refugees, if any, can find refuge here. I will start a cavalry expedition up to Cape Girardeau or Greenville on the 8th (if not too late), and will draw some of the forces away from you. My officers are confident they can spike the guns and burn
