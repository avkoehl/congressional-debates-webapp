THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 14,
General Government. The arguments advanoed to
justify Congress in furnishing educationalprivileges
for the indigent deaf mutes of a State would equally
require a similar provision for the blind or lame
or those who, without natural infirmities, desire
collegiate instruction, but are excluded bytheirpov-
erty from obtaining it.
"Should these views bo regarded as erroneous,
however, and Congress deem it their constitutional
duty to establish and maintain a national deaf-mute
college, tho United States should control it, and be
vested with a title to the grounds purchased by their
for its uses. Tho ercction of buildings required
for the accommodation of all the students who may
dc-ire instruction and maintenance free of charge
will require a very large outlay independent of the
amount which, from time to time, must be advanced
to meet the annual expenses of the institution."
Assuming, what is readily conceded, that it may
be tho duty of the Government to educate the deaf
and dumb of the District in poor and indigent cir-
cumstances, and unable to command means to secure
an education, we find by the last report of the insti-
tution there are twenty-five deaf and dumb pupils
belonging to the District and the Army. The ques-
tion arises, what would it cost the Government per
year to educate each pupil at the best institutions in
the country?
The following is a statement of the annual expense
per pupil m the following deaf and dumb asylums
for the year 1857:
Annual Annual

Asylums. per pupil. paying
pupils.
American asylum, Hartford.... $166 $100
New York institution for deaf
and dumb, New York  138 150
Pennsylvania institution for

phia  113 140
Ohio institution for deaf and
dumb, Columbus  135 100
Kentucky institution for deaf
and dumb, Danville  123 105
Indiana institution for deaf
and dumb, Indianapolis  170 100
Illinois institution lor doaf
and dumb, Jacksonville  190 100
Michigan institution for deaf
and dumb, Flint  123 100
There are no later figures so complete as these, but
the State documents in three States show the follow-
ing expense per pupil for 1806:
Pennsylvania   $2 JO
New York   223
Ohio 220
In Great Britain the annual expense per pupil (in
twentydcaf and dumb asylums) varies from eighteen
to thirty pounds per annum.
It will be seen by this statement that tho highest
cost per pupil in any institution for 1866 was $240
per annum, in the Pennsylvania asylum. The
expense therefore for educating the twenty-live
pupils from the District at the Columbia Institution
would have been #6,000, as against the one item of
£2<3,000 for salaries and incidental expenses and the
other appropriations, taken in connection with tho
interest upon the money which the Government has
appropriated to this institution.
in* roply to suggestions which maybe made touch-
ing tho charitable contributions made by private
individuals for the benefit of this institution, the
following statement is given:

$150 each, the sum of §2,100.
Hon. Amos Kendall subscribed $200 a year for five
years. This amount he paid for two years, making
cash  $400
And on the third year he made a donation of
real estate, which he estimates at. 10,000

with this latter donation.

sources, including real estate at a valuation
of. $10,600
And cash  3,557
And including scholarships subscribed  2,100
Total     $16,257
It will be seen by this statement that the whole
amount of actual money subscriptions was $3,557,
exclusive of money received for fourteen scholar-
ships, at 8150 each, making the sum of $2,100; to this
.should be added $200 a year, paid by Amos Kendall
for two vears. Thecontribution of real estate, valued
a', $10,600, might be taken in connection with thosub-
pfquent purchases of real estate of Mr. Kendall for
the institution, amounting to $2*5,000; giving credit
for the full amount of contributions, including the
estimated value of real estate, they only amount to
$16,257, against $325,860 38, amount appropriated by
the Government.
Tho following letter shows the amount of land pur-
chased for the institution, of whom purchased, and
the amount paid:
Columbia Institution for the Deaf and Dumb,
"Washington", May 5,1868.
Dear Sir : I received last evening a note from
Major Stevens, requesting mo to furnish you a state-
ment of the several purchases of land made for this
institution, with money appropriated by Congress.
On the 13th of July, 1864, a lot of ground con-
taining two acres, and having upon it a dwelling-
house and barn, was purchased of William Stickney,
esq., for the sum of $7,500. On the same day a por-
tion of ground, containing twelve acres and having
upon it three frame buildings, was purchased of Hon.
Amos Kendall for the sum of $18,500.
The payments for these two tracts were made out
of an appropriation of 826,000, made on the 2d of July,
1864, with special reference to these purchases, tho
price having been agreed upon before the appropria-
tion was made.
On the 30th of March, 1867, a picce of ground was
purchased of Mrs. Catharine Pearson, which con-
tained about three and a half acres, (one hundred
and forty-six thousand ninchundrodsquarefeet,) the
price agreed upon being $9,000. On this purchase
there remains yet to be provided for by Congress
§1,600, tho appropriation of tho 2d of March, 1867,
namely $7,500 not being sufficient.
I incloso herewith a plan of our grounds, with
raaiks which will indicate the several purchases
above explained.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully and
truly, yours, E. M. GALDAUDET.
Hon. Rufus P, Spalding.
Amount of appropriation for the Columbia Institu-
tion for the Deaf and Dumb, as reported by the
Secretary of tho Interior $325,560 38
Error in stating amount of one appropria-
tion    300 00
Total amount appropriated $325,860 38
The Register of the Treasury gives vouchers for—
1. Salaries and incidental oxpensos $80,500 00
2. Ercction, furnishing, fitting up addi-
tions  142,280 87
3. Maintenance and tuition of pupils  29,351 00
4. Inclosuro and grading grounds  15,500 00
5. Erection of barn, carriage-house, &c.... 14,500 00
6. Increased supply of Potomac water  5,000 00

arrangements  1,470
9. Appiopriation for supplying
eteam heating apparatus  2,250
  29,720 00
$325,860 38
It will bo seen by the above statement that there
have been expended for salaries and incidental ex-
penses $89,500, and for maintenance and tuition of
pupils 829,351, making in all $118,851. Taking this
amount from the total amount appropriated, $325,-
860 33, leaves 5207,009 38, which the Government has
invested in buildings, grounds, improvements, <fcc.,
which is about two thirds of the whole amount, and
for which it has nothiug to show, and over which it
has no control, tho institution being, as has been
shown, one of a privato character. Tho question
now is, what shall bo done undcrthc circumstances ?
It is evident that Congress "would not be justified in
making any further appropriations for this institu-
tion, unless it shall bccomc a Government insti-
tution, with the property all transferred to the Gov-
ernment, and the institution to be managed and
controlled by the Government. Kven that is not
now recommended, as it would devolve upon the
Government a vastly greater expense than it would
cost to educate all the doaf and dumb of the District
at the very best institutions in the country.
Congress has made donations to other charitable
institutions in tho District, and is now called upon
to make still farther appropriations for them, and
without reserving to itself any right of control over
tho expenditures. Astheamountsappropriatodand
tho amounts asked for are so large, it is evident that
before any further appropriation shall be made the
whole subject should be further considered and a
special law passed, establishing a "commission of
chaiities" for the District, to regulate and control all
the charitable institutions of the District, sustained
by the beneficence of the Government.

"Wo agree to the conclusions of the above report,
because wo are opposed to the oollegiate course in-
troduced into the institution, and also to any appro-
priation of Congress to a corporation that is not
wholly under tho control of the Government,
BENJAMIN F, BUTLER,
F. C. BJBAMAN.
I concur in the foregoing report so far as it recom-
mends, Jas a conditiou of further appropriation to tho
institution, its transfer to the full ownership and con*
trolofthe General Government, ^ ^ BLAINE,
Mr. WASHBUBNE, of Illinois. I have
asked the Doorkeeper to place a copy of this
report upon the table of each member. I call
the attention of gentlemen to the fourth page
of this printed report, where they will see
stated the amounts we have appropriated for
this institution, in which, as I haye already
said, the Government has no interest whatever.
The statement is as follows:
For the erection, furnishing, and fitting up of addi-
tions to the Columbia Institution for the Deaf and
Dumb   $168,280 87
For supplying the building with gas-mak-
ing apparatus and fixtures ..  1,4<0 00
For the erection of a brick barn-, carriage
liouse, cow-house, &e   .. 14,500 00
For furnishing an increased supply of
Potomae water, &c  5,000 00
For supplying the institution with steam
heating apparatus, &c    2,250 00
For the enlargement of the grounds  ^200 00
For inclosure, grading, and improvement
ofgrounds  8,000 00
For salaries and incidental expenses for
instruction of deaf and dumb  89,500 00
For maintenance and tuition of x^upiis  29,359 51
Total $325,560 38
All this has been appropriated for the pur-
pose of educating twenty-five pupils a year in
this institution. And a little further on iii the
report gentlemen will find a statement show-
ing how this thing has grown up; how we have
gone on year after year increasing these appro-
priations. There have been expended for
salaries and incidental expenses as follows:
For the year ending June 30—
185 8 $1,789 40
185 9   3,460 60
186 0  3,000 00
186 1  3,000 00
18(52  3,750 00
186 3  4,100 00
186 4  4,400 00
1865   7,500 00
I860 12,500 00
1807 ^0,i31 14
1863  24,873 34
We appropriate this sum in gross. Yet we
have no control over the institution. We put
the whole of this vast amount under the con-
trol of the superintendent, who has given only
one bond, which is in the sum of §3,000. Yet
we appropriate thousands and tens of thou-
sands and hundreds of thousands to build up
this establishment, and allow the money to
be disposed of as the superintendent sees fit,
without any control whatever on the part of
the Government.
Now, sir, I understand very well how this
institution started. It was at first merely a
private institution. But afterward those in-
terested in it came in here and said that many
benevolent individuals had made large sub-
scriptions for the benefit of the institution;
hence we were asked to make appropriations
for it; and we did so. Now? sir, the aggregate
of subscriptions from private sources was
$16,257. How was that amount contributed?
It will be seen by the statement contained in
the report of the minority that the actual
amount of cash subscribed was §3,557, exclu-
sive of the money received from scholarships,
which, at the rate ol §5150 each amounts to
§2,100. To this is to be added $200 a year
paid by Mr. Amos Kendall. Then there was
a contribution also by Mr. Kendall of real
estate valued at $10,600. The Government
afterward purchased additional real estate of
Mr. Kendall, paying him $26,000, ar,d giving
him credit for the full amount of contributions,
including the real estate at its estimated value.
The total amount of private contributions from
all sources is $16,257, against $325,OQO appro-
priated by the Government. The appropria-
tions proposed to be made in this bill will
make the aggregate $376,000, which we shall
have _ given to a private institution in this
District.
And what do we get for this amount taken
from the pockets of our constituents and ex-
pend^dxon a private corporation here in the
District of Columbia? By refereace to the
