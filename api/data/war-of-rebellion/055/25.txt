WASHINGTON, November 25, 1863-8.40 a.m.

Your dispatches as to fighting on Monday and Tuesday are here. Well done. Many thanks to all. Remember Burnside.

A. LINCOLN,

President United States.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, November 25, 1863-11.30 a.m.

I congratulate you on the success thus far of your plans. I fear that General Burnside is hard pressed and that any further delay may prove fatal. I know that you will do all in your power to relieve him.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

(Received 10 p.m)

Although the battle lasted from early dawn till dark this evening, I believe I am not premature in announcing a complete victory over Bragg. Lookout Mountain top, all the rifle-pits in Chattanooga Valley, and Missionary Ridge entire have been carried, and now held by us. I have no idea of finding Bragg here to-morrow.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General, Commanding.

CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee, November 25, 1863-7.30 p.m.

(Received 2.10 a.m., 26th.)

I have heard from Burnside to the 23d, when he had rations for ten or twelve days. He expected to hold out that time. I shall move the force from here on the railroad between Cleveland and Dalton, and send a column of 20,000 men up the south side of the Tennessee, without wagons, carrying four days' rations and taking a steam-boat loaded with rations, from which to draw on the route.

If Burnside holds out until this force gets beyond Kingston, I think enemy will fly, and, with the present state of the roads, must abandon almost everything. I believe Bragg will lose much of his army by desertion, in consequence of his defeat in the last three days' fight.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
