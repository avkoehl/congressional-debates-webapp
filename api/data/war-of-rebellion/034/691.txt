Louisville, and those from the District of Ohio to Western Virginia, where a raid anticipated, and General White is now out with the force from Louisa. I hope you will be able to manage Morgan with the force you have after him. There troops at Lesington and Frankfort should go into the fortifications if they ate too pressed, and the troops at Hickman Bridge put themselves in a position for defense. The necessary instructions will be given for the equipments required for Byrd's command and the Fifth Tennessee.

CINCINNATI, July 5, 1863.

General HARTSUFF:

Re-enforcements reached Lebanon in time to throw shells at rear guard, but did not follow. I have sent for commanding officer to come to office, and will learn the reason for not following. It looks like a bad, piece of business.

HEADQUARTERS,Louisville, July 5, 1863-6.15 p. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

I have heard nothing of Morgan's position since dispatch from Colonel Hanson at Lebanon, saying Morgan was on Muldraugh's Hill, between Lebanon and Campbellsville. Last night at 12 o'clock Judah telegraphed a dash for this city. I have about 1,600, including convalescents. Believe I can raise about 2,000 Home Guards or citizens. The artillery and cavalry from Indianapolis not yet arrived. Hartsuff has not informed me as to Morgan's movements. Can you give me any information on the subject?

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.

JULY 5, 1863.

General BOYLE, Louisville:

The last information of the enemy, thought General Hartsuff, was that Morgan, with a part of his force, was at Lebanon this morning, making an attack. This afternoon he reports a rebel force at Liberty.

All the dispatches seem to be indefinite.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

LEXINGTON, July 5, 1863. (Received 6.30 p. m.)

General BOYLE:

No information from Lebanon since early this morning. Line cut. Hanson was attacked this morning at 3 o'clock. Not in very great force there, but main body supposed coming up. Eight and Ninth Michigan Cavalry encamped 3 miles Danville last night; must now be in Lebanon.

GEO. L. HARTSUFF,

Major-General.
