Numbers 104. Report of Brigadier General John Pegram, C. S. Army, commanding brigade.
HEADQUARTERS PEGRAM'S BRIGADE,Camp near Somerville Ford, January 21, 1864.

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that on November 27, 1863, having been left on picket at the several fords in this vicinity, I awaited being relieved by the cavalry of General Fitz. Lee, and then proceeded to join the division, which had preceded my brigade to Mine Run. Arriving there early in the afternoon, I took position with the division about 1 mile to the west of Locust Grove, where we remained until withdrawn during the night back to the west side of the run. During the throwing up the breastworks by the remainder of the division my brigade was held in reserve, and remained bivouacked just in rear of the line of works.

During this time I had two regiments (the Thirteenth and Fifty-eighth Virginia) successively thrown to the front as skirmishers, where they occasionally exchanged shots with the enemy, but with no casualties on our side.

On the morning of December 2, my brigade moved along the works until its right rested on the plank road, where it remained for an hour or two, when, with the rest of the division, it followed after the retreating enemy to within 3 miles of Germanna Ford. We then returned to Mine Run, where we remained during the night and returned to our present position on the next morning.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. PEGRAM,

Brigadier-General.

Major JOHN W. DANIEL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Early's Division.
