HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT, Saint Louis, June 27, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER,Cape Girardeau:

I will go to Cape Girardeau by the middle of the week if possible. I think you had better send a company to Dallas; also that you should send Preuitt three or four companies, and keep him fully supplied whit all the cavalry he needs to break up any rebel force within striking distance of New Madrid. It is not known when the horses can be got for Captain Preuitt's men. The Cavalry Bureau does not seem able to furnish them at all. You will therefore send the captain all the horses you can get from your teams, and also the companies above referred to. Do not send any officer who ranks him.
