Mr. SPRAGUE. The Committeo on Claims,
to whom was referred tho petition of John A.
Sutter, praying compensation for land owned
by him in California, and held under Mexican
grants, which was settled upon and occupied
by settlers from the United States, under the
plea that it was public land, after the conquest
of California, and indemnity for tho seizure
and destruction of large quantities of his lsve
stock by parties of emigrants from tho Unite;!
States, ask to be discharged from its further
consideration.
t desire to say one word in reference to this
claim. General Sutter acquired a largo tract
of land just prior to the occupation of Califor-
nia by the United States. It was one of those
five grants made by the Mexican Government
which the Supreme Court havo disallowed.
The courts have confirmed to General Sutter
a former grant to a large property. General
Sutter further claims damages for stock taken
and for the moneys received by the United
States from settlers on the grant referred to.
The people of tho United States are under great
obligation to General Sutter for his hospitali-
ties to destitute emigrants, and for having early
discovered through his labors tbe gold fields
of California. The Government cannot always
sufficiently reward the patriotic acts and self-
sacrifices of every citizen. He must at times
make those sacrifices without pecuniary recog-
nition, but will live in their memory with giai-
itude long after lie shall have ceased to exist.
Such seems to your committee to be the case
of General Sutter. They therefore asl; tnat
they be discharged from its farther consider-
ation.
