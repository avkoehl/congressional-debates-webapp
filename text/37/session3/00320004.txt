EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATION.
The SPEAKER, by unanimous consent, laid
before the House a communication from the Sec-
retary of State, showing the number of seamen
registered in .the several ports of entry in the
United States for the year ending 30th Septem-
ber, 1862; which was laid on the table, and or-
dered to be printed.
REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
The SPEAKER proceeded, as the regular order
of business, to call the committees for reports;
under which call-
Mr. HOOPER, from the Committee of Ways
and Means, reported a bill concerning judgments
in certain suits brought by the United States;
which was read a first and second time.
Mr. HOOPER. 1 am instructed by the com-
mittee to request that the bill may be acted upon
at this time.
Mr. VALLAND1GIIAM." Let it be read.
The bill, which was read, piovides that all
judgments recovered by the United States in suits
now pending or hereafter to be brought for the
collection or recovery of any duties upon imports,
or any money due to the United States from any
collector or other offictfrof customs of the United
States, shall bo paid in the gold or silver coin of
the United States.
Mr. HOOPER. If any gentleman desires in-
formation in relation to the necessity of passing
this bill, I will say that in suits brought to recover
duties on impoits,or money due from collectors,
or other officers of the custom-house, if the Gov-
ernment recovers judgment, it will be rendered
for theamount in money, without specifying that
it was for duties that are required to be paid in
specie. As the law now stands, the judgment
would be satisfied by payment of the amount in
Government notes, worth now at least one quarter
less than gold. The Government would thus lose,
and the party against whom the judgment was re-
covered would gain that difference. This bill is
intended to meet these cases. Many suits are
now pending, involving large amounts; it is theie-
fore important that this bill, if it is to be passed,
should be acted upon promptly.
No objection being made, the bill was ordered
to be engrossed, and read a third time; and being
engrossed, it was accordingly read the third time",
and passed.
Mr. HOOPER moved to reconsider the vote by
which the bill was passed, and also moved to lay
the motion to reconsider on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
'The list of committees having been called
through, the States were called for resolutions as
the next order of business.
PAY OF SOLDIERS.
Mr.HOLMAN introduced the following reso-
lution:
Resolved, That the Committee on Military Affairs be in-
structed to report a bit! increasing the pay of private sol-
diets in the Army to fifleen dollars per month, und malting
&uch leduction in the salaries oi officers of the Army not
actually engaged in active service in tile field as may not
impair the efficiency of the public service.
Mr.OLIN. Permit me to inquire of the Speaker
whether, if objection is made to this resolution,
its consideration does not go over under the rule
to another day ?
The SPEAKER. Under this call all resolu-
tions which give rise to debate go over under the
rule.
Mr. IiOLMAN. Rather than have the reso-
lution go over,l will modify it so as to make it a
resolution of inquiry merely, if that will obviate
the gentleman's objection.
Mr. VALLANDIGJHAM. 1 would suggest to
the gentleman from Indiana that he make the fif-
teen dollars payable in gold.
Mr. HOLiVIAN. I modify my resolution so as
to make it one of inquiry.
Mr. RICHARDSON. I move to amend the
resolution so as to make the amount payable to
the soldiers and non-commissioned officers in gold
and silver.
Mr. LOVEJOY. That is not in order.
The SPEAKER. The resolution is open to
amendment, but not to debate. No debate has
thus far arisen.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. I should have
moved this amendment myself, hat I understood
that the previous question had been demanded.
The SPEAKER. The Chair did not under-
stand the gentleman from Indiana, after modify-
ing the resolution, as demanding- the previous
question. The resolution was, therefore, still
open to amendment, but notto debate. The gen-
tleman from Illinois [Mr. Richardson] proposes
an amendment.
Mr. HOLMAN. I trust, as this is only a res-
olution of inquiry, my friend will not press his
amendment.
Mr. RICHARDSON. "Well,! will withdraw
it; but it is right.
Mr. Holman's resolution was then adopted.
Mr, RICHARDSON. I did not observe when
the State of Illinois was called, and I now ask
leave to offer the resolution which I send to the
Clerk's desk.
The resolution was read, as follows:
Resolved, That the Committee on Military Affairs be in-
structed to report a bill requiring the pay of each private
and non-commissioned ofheer in actual service in the
Army to be paid m gold and silver.
Mr. OLIN. If the gentleman will modify his
resolution, so as to make it one of inquiry and
not one of instruction, I will not object to its in-
troduction.
Mr. RICHARDSON. No, sir; I will get it in
some other time.
