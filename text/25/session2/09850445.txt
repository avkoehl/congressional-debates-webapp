25th Cong--->2nd Sess.
and I will be as ready as any to decide upon it.
The difference between the separation proposed by
this bill, and the connection between Bank and
State for which they clamor, is this • The bill pro-
poses, whilst it leaves the custody of the revenues
jn the hands of the public officers, to take from the
Executive the power of using these funds. The
connection which they espouse, not only leaves the
public purse in the hands of Executive officers
whilst it is collecting and disbursing, but, as I have
before attempted to show, gives the President
the means of using these funds through the banks
for purposes of patronage. There is but one way
in which this question of the union between the
purse and sword can be fairly and practically
raised, that is, by submitting a proposition to place
the Secretary of the Treasury under the control
of Congres-!. So long as he is treated as an Ex-
ecutive officer, the President may exercise, through
him, a control over the custody of the Federal
revenues. When gentleman make this proposi-
tion, I shall then think that they wish to raise
this issue, but until then, I must suppose that their
declamation is designed merely for effect.
But, sir, another objection is urged against this
bill, which, if founded in truth, would be con-
clusive to my mind against it With great felici-
ty of imagination, some have converted the unpro-
mising materials of this bill into a Treasury bank,
with alius forms of horror. They say it is a law
for a Treasury bank of circulation and discount
When I ask them for the feature which makes it
so, they point to the power left w ith the Secretary to
draw upon the depositories for transfer and disburse-
ment. It this be so, then 1 reply that gentlemen will
have a Treasury bank when they dtfeat this bill,
for these poweis exist, and to a gre^t extent, under
the law orgai izing the Treasui} Department I go
farther, sir, and maintain that, if this inference be
true, then the Government cannot proceed without
such a bank, for it is obvious that unless the Secre-
tary could transfer money by warrant from one
point to another, and draw upon the funds when
deposited for disbursement, he would be forced to
keep the public tieasure himself, and eithei go to
every public creditor with it, or force them to come
to him Every man in the community would view
such a provision as preposterous But if it be
admitted that no such Treasury Bank has existed
here ofore, then I maintain that if these powers,
vested in the Secretary from the institution of the
Government up to this period, have not produced a
Treasury Bank, it is not likely that one should
arise under this bill, which limits tnese powers
And this brings me to the nature of this limitation
In conducting this comparison between the chances
of perverting these powers to such purposes under
the law oiganmng the Treasury Department and
under this bill, 1 beg leave to premise that the
place of deposite is nothm¿ to this question, inas-
much as they may be abused as well when the
funds are deposited in banks as in the hands of pub-
lic officer. Jbirst, then, let us kok to the relative
chances for perverting them to the puiposes of
a Government circula'ion Under the old law,
Alexander Hamilton claimed the power* "to is-
sue Treasury drafts, receivaule at the several
custom houses, and in anticipation of the duties "
From thence he argued to the conclusion, that he
might receive bank notes issued upon a specie
fund, and did receive such notes, notwithstanding
the law, which required gold and silver to be paid
Nay, we have lately seen, under this law, drafts
drawn upon public funds in banks, and made so
receivable In short, there is under this law no
limitation as to the time of payment, or present-
ment, Oi. tneir drafts By the bill, on the contrary,
the Secietary is required to make provision for tne
speedy presentation of these drafts, and the holder
is notified that unless he complies w ith these pro-
visions, the place of payment may be changed.
Under this law, the Secretary could not issue
dralts which would circulate without a violation of
law because no draft can answer the purposes of
circulation, which requires a speedy presenta-
tion   for  payment      Upon   this   point,   to   sa-

TO THE CONGRESSIONAL
Independent Treasury—Mr. Hunter.
tisfy all qualms, I would be willing to vote for a
provision specifying the time within which
such drafts must be paid, although I do not deem
the provision necessary, or even very material
Again- under this bill, these drafts could nevir be-
come a circulating medium, because they would
not be receivable in payment for public dues. No
thing but specie, or evidences of public debt"
which the Secretary cannot execute, except by
authority of law, being receivable for dues to the
Government.
I come now to the comparison as to the means
of discounting, which these powers are said to con-
fer upon this imaginary Treasury Bank. Under
the law organizing the Treasury Department, Ha-
milton claimed the power to draw his drafts and
sell them through his officers, and accordingly,
upon his own confession, he did make and sell
such drafts upoT credits of thirty and sixty da}s,
and this, too, m exchange for bank paper Now,
sir, if this power would remain after the passage ot
this bill, it would flow, not from the bill, but from
the law to which I have just referred. In truth,
however, no opportunity would exist for such an
abuse of power when the b.U had reached its ulti-
mate policy—I mean the entire collection of the
public revenue in specie. Public creditors would
then be paid in specie, and the operation of these
drafts would be this, if the draft upon a distant
place would be worth its amount m specie, the
disbursing officer would exchange it for specie to
pay the public debt. In this case, there would
be evidence that there should be no transfer of
specie from the place of deposite, and none
would be made Upon the contrary, if the draft
vould not command a similar amount of specie,
then this specie would be transferred by Govern-
ment, and the state of the money market would
prove it to be expedient. The exchange of the
draft for cash, or m other words for specie, would
give the Government no patronage, its exchange
for credit, as was practised under the law organi-
zing the Treasury Department, would give it an
improper patronage, and yet gentlemen oppose
this bill, which limits the powers whose abuse they
fear, and propose to leave the original law, under
which they are unrestrained.
But when the opponents of the bill are driven
from this ground, what is the other position which
they assume? Why, sir, because the public money
is in the hands of the officers of tne Government,
they argue that it will be used by them for banking
purposes, although this bill makes it a penitentiary
offence m them to make such a use of the money
confided to their care It has always been reckon-
ed a little curious that honest Fluellen should have
attempted to establish an analogy between Mace-
don and Monmouth, because there w as a n\ er m
both, but his comparison will have its parallel,
when the Treasury of the United States shall be
identified with a bank, because, forsooth, there is
money in both
I come now, Mr Chairman, to the last of the ob-
jections to this bill, which I propose to notice It is
said that this Dill falls short of the line of our duty,
because it does not regu'ate, or m other words
make, a currency Upon this point, I beg leave to
stale that if there be two constitutional modes of at-
taining a const tutional end, and the incidental ef-
fects of ore upon the currency are better than those
of the other, that the¡t we should prefer that mode
whose incidental operation is best Accordingly,
I have endeavored to show that the incidental ef-
fects of this bill upon the currency were salutary,
and they extend as far, I believe, as our power
over the subject For one, I utterly deny that it is
either our duty oi our right to regulate the cur-
rency This power is now derived mainly upon
the argument which implies it as necessary for the
regulation of commerce Now, sir, I maintain
that it is against reason to imply a power as ne-
cessary to carry out a power expressly granted,
when that which is implied is as important m its
own nature, as that is which is granted If both
ba equal in. importance, there is as mi ch
reason to suppose that the fiamets of theConsti u-
tion would have specified tne one as the oihei If
they intended to give both, they would have speci-
fied both.   Still less reasonable is it to suppose that

they designed to give, by implication, a power more
important in its own nature than that which they
specified as the necessary means of carrying out
the less important end. I dsny, therefore, that
the right to regulate currency caí? be implied as
the means necessary to regulate commerce, inas-
much as the former power is more important
and extensive than the latter. The first reaches
directly every class of the community, and every
species of property, whilst the latter affects im-
mediately but one class of productive industry
This conclusion is fortified in my mind by the
clause of the Constitution which forbids any thing
but gold and silver to be made a legal tender
between man and man. To suppose that the
framers of this instrument would give this Go-
vernment a power to make, a currency of any
thing but gold and silver, and yet deny it the
privilege of making this currency a legal tender
between its citizens, is to believe that it gave us
the right to pass a law, but at the same time
provided that any individual might nullify it at
his pleasure
Having now reviewed most of the arguments
for and against the bill, I beg leave briefly to re-
capitulate the reason which induce me to support
this measure I believe, first, that it will operate
as a gentle but salutary checkuponthe mischievous
operations of our banking system upon foreign
trade, secondly, it will take away the bounty here-
tofore offered by this Government to the States for
the depreciation of their currency, and relieve, ma
great degree, not only the different sections of this
Confederacy, but the different States of the same
section from the unequal operation of our fiscal
system upon commerce, thirdly, it will relieve
the General Government f-om its dependence up-
on these State institutions, and thus the people will
nave it more m their power through the Sta'e Le-
gislatures to effect necessary reforms in the bank-
ing system, and, fourthly, it will take from the
Executive, not only an immense amount of bank
patronage, but also the power to alter the standard
of value
I cannot, however, pass from this subject, with-
out explaining clearly my opinion ¡n relation to the
extent to which this bill wculd reform our currency
I have already said that I thought its opera-
tion in this regard would be gentle and
salutary. Fuithei than this I have declared
my belief that our authority docs not extend.
But the public would be deceived if it expected
from this measure a thorough reform in our
banKing system This work must be performed
by the people, through the State Governments,
who alone have authority ovpr the subject It
is not for me here to indicate the means by which
I believe this great work might be accomplished
I wdl declare my opinion, however, that a rational
spirit of reform will seek, as its first object, to take
gradually from these institutions th  power of mak-
ing a currtrey They will thus be divested of the
great source of their mischieis, wnilst all mat is
beneficial in their operations w ill ba left to them
The great considerations which ha\ e hitherto sus-
tained them, notwithstanding th^ir tremendous
?buses, have been that individuals obtained through
them the use of capital, whilst society found their
agency useful in tiansactmg its exchanges Their
power to perform these useful functions were, how-
ever, rather diminished than increased by endowing
them with the privilege of cnangmg the standaid
of value. In the infancy of our society, w hen they
«ere first instituted, there were no laige capitalists
in the country. It was a known principle tuat
capital could be employed at a less interest
in masses than m small quantities The
natural means of converting 'hts pimcipie
to a beneficial use was to aggiegate this capi-
tal by incorporations Theie was no necessity
to ha\e gnen these mcorpoiations the power of
making c irrency for sale On the contrary, w ith-
out this power, if there had been no restrictions
upon them as to ínis-esl, u is m?n ie't that we
should have procured at once our just -share of the
capital of the werld, at precise!/ what it was
worth It is one of ihe vices of our banking s,s-
tem, that its rate of interest is fixed. Thej have
no means of using this interest like the Bank of
