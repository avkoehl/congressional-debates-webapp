GENERAL: General Hood has written twice to know if you can relieve the detachment of Lee's corps west of Peach Tree road. He also wrote you that he was moving on the enemy. I have sent to both generals to know how many men they can spare, and General Cheatham, who is here,has sent to see whether he can draw out a brigade and place it on the road to await your order.

Respectfully,

T. B. ROY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
