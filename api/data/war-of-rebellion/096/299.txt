Information of the movement of Mahone's division last Wednesday fully corroborated, with additional particulars that they took only two day's rations and left back all baggage and camp furniture. Generally understood in camp that they had gone on a raid and would shortly return. Deserters from Gordon's division corroborate information of yesterday-that his division has moved up the Boydton plank road and is now occupying Mahone's old camps.

Major General J. G. PARKE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

Deserters this morning report that it was rumored Mahone's division had left for Willmington on Wednesday. The sick from the Chimborazo, Camp Jackson, and Camp Winder hospitals had been removed and the hospitals were being whitewashed. Quartermaster's stores, such as clothing, boots, and shoes, had also been moved on the Danvile road. There is much disaffection among the troops of Terry's brigade, and it is said that the officers in Pickett's division are holding meetings and passing resolutions whether they shall go back into the Union, adopting the terms of the United States Government or continue to fight. The deserters say that these meetings are presided over by the colonels of regiments, resolutions are offered, and the men invited to give their votes, which is done for effect. The men are afraid to get up and declare their honest intentions, and the consequence is that it is taken for granted and declared by the officers that they are in favor of fighting it out. These resolutions are paraded in the papers for effect and to create a good state of feeling, Such a meeting was held the other day by Terry's brigade in large house near their lines.
