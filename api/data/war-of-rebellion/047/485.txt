CHARLESTON, November 4, 1863.

Colonel J. R. WADDY,

Chief of Ordnance Department:

COLONEL: In accordance with instructions received on the 1st, I have the honor to report twenty-one guns of various calibers on the lines and batteries of James Island that may be rifled, if so many are required. I would here remark that all of the old 12-pounders of 33 and 37 cwt. (more or less) are of the best iron used in the fabrication or ordnance. Next, the 32-pounders of 37 [75?] cwt. (more or less). Third, the navy 32-pounders, 61 cwt. The 24-pounders of 1862, and especially those of 1848 and 1851, marked S. C. (South Carolina), are not made of the best iron, and most of them are rifled guns for field service, I have scrupulously adhered to my instructions, and have marked every gun free from exterior or interior defects with a cross-mark (+) cut upon the center of the cascables, or on the upper jaw of navy guns, without taking into consideration the quality of the metal.

The following is the list:

NEW LINES.

Battery No. 1.-One old pattern 12-pounder, 34 cwt.; one old pattern 12-pounder, 33 cwt.

Battery Numbers 2.-One 24-pounder.

Battery Numbers 3.-Three 12-pounders, 37 cwt.; two 24-pounders of 1851.

Battery Numbers 4.-Two 32-pounders of 75 cwt.; one 24-pounder, pattern of 1851.

Battery Numbers 5.-Two 24-pounders, pattern 1851; one 12-pounder, of 37 cwt.

Secessionville.-One 32-pounder, of 75 cwt.

EAST LINES.

East Redoubt.-One 32-pounder, of 75 cwt.

Redoubt Numbers 3 (from the marsh).-One 24-pounder, pattern of 1828.

Redoubt Numbers 4 (from the marsh).-One 24-pounder, pattern of 1848.

Fort Pemberton.-One 32-pounder, of 75 cwt.

WEST LINES.

One 12-pounder, of 61 cwt.

Twenty-one guns.

The 24-pounder reported by Major Manigault was formerly placed on the western lines by the chief of artillery, and instructions given by him that the piece should never be served with a greater charge than 4 pounds of powder. It is impossible to say what number of rounds the gun would sustain, but would conjecture at least 100 rounds, with the charge ordered by the chief of artillery. It would be prudent, however, to turn it over to the arsenal.

Respectfully submitted.

JOHN G. BARNWELL,

Major, Corps Art., C. S. Army, Insp. Ord. Dept.
