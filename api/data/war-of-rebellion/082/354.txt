Brigadier General R. B. POTTER,

Commanding Second Division, Ninth Corps:

GENERAL: The main gallery is completed. I have excavated two other galleries, commencing at the inner extremity of the mine, and running under the enemy's works. The length of both these galleries is fifty feet (not of each). The ground is full of springs where I am now mining, but I could have made better progress in the last three days if I had not stopped the work frequently to prop it securely, and in order to listen and ascertain if the enemy was mining near us.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY PLEASANTS,

Lieutenant-Colonel.

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that the enemy's fire on our left has increased during the day. He has been constructing rifle-pits between his main line and ours, on the slope at the head of the ravine beyond the railroad cut. A caisson or magazine in the rebel earthwork opposite our left was exploded at 4 o'clock this afternoon, by a shell from our battery near the burnt house.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT B. POTTER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
