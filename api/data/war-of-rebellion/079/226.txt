(Received 5 a. m. 13th.)

Major-General SHERMAN:

Resaca was attacked to-day by the enemy's infantry. Colonel Watkins evacuated Calhoun and crossed his men to Resaca, leaving horse on this side. At 10 o'clock to-night musketry was still heard. I started from Calhoun to-day and found road broken above Adairsville and repaired it. Left Colonel Raum with 350 infantry at Calhoun to try to communicate. Loaded up all the abandoned commissary stores and brought them here with three locomotives and trains that are now ready to take troops up the road if you desire to send any. I also placed garrisons in the block-houses that had been abandoned. The summons to surrender is signed J. B. Hood, General, and closes by saying, "If the place is carried by assault no prisoners will be taken. " Our men did not see it. If I heard anything more I will send you word. One regiment of enemy's infantry passed through Calhoun an hour before I got met of enemy's infantry passed through Calhoun an hour before I got there.
