CONFIDENTIAL.] HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

July 11, 1864.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Commanding Ninth Corps:

I am instructed by the major-general commanding to inform you that information received this morning shows that Hill's corps has been withdrawn from our front, and appearances indicate that it has been sent northward. A division of cavalry has been ordered up on our left to make a reconnaissance in connection with the Second Corps, to-night and to-morrow, to ascertain where Hill is. Should it turn out that Hill's corps has been detached from Lee's army, Lieutenant-General Grant propose that Hancock's and Warren's corps shall make a detour to the left and endeavor to take Petersburg by assault from the west, while your corps and Smith's make a joint heavy assault at once point, say near the Hare house. The commanding general desires you to make such examinations as are necessary to determine how your left should be refused in the event of such a plan being adopted, so that you will be prepared to take up a line for the protection of your left flank. General Ferrero will be ordered back to you if the plank is adopted.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, July 11, 1864-10.10 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have the honor to report that nothing worthy of note has occurred on my line to-day. About 5 p.m. the enemy attempted to communicate with us by flag of truce, but it proving to be only an attempt to exchanges papers I would not permit it. The ordinary skirmishing continues.
