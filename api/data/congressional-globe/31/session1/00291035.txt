CONSTRUCTION OF LAWS.
Mr. FEATHERSTON, from the Committee on
the Post Office and Post Roads, reported the fol-
lowing resolution :
Resolved, That the President of the United States be re-
quested to have prepared, and communicated to this House,
at the commencement of the next session, all the opinions
of the Attorneys General of the United States delivered
since the first day of March, 1841, which give construction
to tile public laws not of a temporary character.
The resolution having been readâ€”
Mr. CROWELL said, he would suggest to the
gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. Featherston]
so to modify the resolution as to embrace the
whole period since the publication of the former
volume. The opinions contained in the former
volume came up only to 1837.
Mr. CONRAD said, thatwhen he had yesterday
reported a bill from the Committee on Commerce,
to authorize the Postmaster General to contract for
carrying the mail in steamboats between New Or-
leans and Vera Cruz, and intermediate points, ob-
jection had been made that the subject was not
within the jurisdiction of that committee. Now,
he (Mr. C.) would like to know from the gentle-
men composing the Committee on the Post Office
and Post Roads, how it was that a resolution pro-
viding for the publication of the opinions of the
Attorneys General came from that committee?
Mr. FEATHERSTON said, it wouid give him
great pleasure to reply to the inquiry of the gen-
tleman from Louisiana, [Mr. Conrad.] He (Mr.
F.) did not know that this matter belonged more
propei ly to one committee of the House than to
another. The object of the resolution was to ob-
tain the opinions of the Attorneys General since
the year 1840, for the use of the Post Office Com-
mittee, as well as of every other committee of the
House. The committee desired that these opin-
ions should be obtained for the use of the mem-
bers of the House generally, and for the use of the
Government. The fact was notorious, that the
officers of the Government needed these opinions.
In the year 1840 the House made a similar call
upon the President, for all the opinions of the At-
torneys General published previous to that time.
On the first of March, 1841, all the opinions pre-
viously delivered, giving construction to general
laws, were furnished to the House. They were
printed in one voiume.
Mr. CONGER rose, he said, to a question of
order. He desired to be informed by the Speaker,
whether this resolution was in order? And he
would make one remark. Some time ago the
Committee on Public Expenditures, of which he
(Mr. C.) was a member, reported, or, more prop-
erly speaking, offered to report a bill m relation to
the public lands. ' He well recollected that on that
occasion a question of order had been raised, that
the committee was not possessed of jurisdiction m
the matter. And he now submitted to the Chair,
as a point of order, that the Committee on the
Post Office was not possessed of jurisdiction over
this matter.
The SPEAKER. The Chair must decide that
this lesolution from the Commutee on the Post
Office is not in order. The subjectembraced in the
resolution has not, the Speaker understands, been
referred to that committee by the House;-and the
Speaker would further remark, that even if the
resolution was regularly in order from the com-
mittee, it could not be considered to-day, except
by the unanimous consent of the House.
Mr. FEATHERSTON. Not in order if reported
from a committee?
The SPEAKER. Not in order to-day.
Mr. CONGER would move, he said, that the
resolution be referred to the Committee on the
Judiciary.
Mr. FEATHERSTON said, he had no objec-
tion that such a disposition of the resolution
should be made, for he lelt satisfied that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary would report it back to the
House with a recommendation that it should be
adopted.
The SPEAKER said, if no objection was made,
the resolution would take the direction which had
been proposed.
No objection having been made, the resolution
was referred to the Committee or*he Judiciary.
THE POST OFFICE COMMITTEE.
Mr. POTTER, under instructions from the
Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads, re-
ported a resolution authorizing that committee to
employ a clerk temporarily.
: The resolution having been read,
Mr. JONES inquired of the Speaker, whether
the resolution was the report of a committee?
The-SPEAKER answered in the affirmative.
Mr. JONES said, he believed that the House,
during the present session, had steadfastly refused
to allow clerks either to the standing or select com-
mittees. There were but two standing committees
of the House that were allowed a clerk. Of one of
these committees he was a member, and if the
clerk had been of any sort of service he (Mr. J.)
had yet to find out the fact. He had been a mem-
ber of the Committee on the Post Office and Post
Roads during a former Congress, and could testify
that they had then no use for a clerk. He moved
that the resolution be laid upon the table.
Mr. CONGER appealed to the gentleman from
Tennessee, [Mr. Jones,] to withdraw the motion,
to enable him (Mr. C.) to say a few words.
Mr. JONES. I will withdraw the motion if
you will promise to renew it.
Mr. CONGER. Well, 1 accept the condition.
So the motion to lay the resolution on the table
was withdrawn.
Mr. CONGER said, that if the Committee on
the Post Office and Post Roads desired the services
of a clerk for the purpose of maturing a bill upon
the subject of cheap postage, he should not object
to giving them the requisite authority. But he
had some days ago understood, that the committee
were prepared to report a bill providing for the re-
duction of postages, and for other reforms. The
committee, he had understood, were ready to make
such a report. 1 f he had been misinformed he should
like to be apprised of the fact. If he had not been
misinformed, then he must beg leave to say, that
he thought it strange, very strange, that the com-
mittee had not, ere this, reported the bill; for,
if his recollection did not mislead him, he had re-
ceived this information from a credible source
more than two weeks ago. JU" the bill had been
maturedâ€”if the committee wre ready to reportâ€”
there would be so much labor oft' their hands, and
he, for one, could see no propriety in the adoption
of a resolution authorising them to employ a
clerk. That he would say again, that if a clerk
was needed for the purpose of aiding the commit-
tee in maturing such a bill, he would make no ob-
jection. He thought that the whole country was
prepared to authorize them to incur almost any ex-
panseâ€”to furnish any amount of force which the
committee might ask, in order to aid them in
bringing before the House a bill which would te
somewhat in accordance with the prayer of the
numberless petitions which had been poured-in
upon this House from every section of the coun-
try. The country is demanding postage reform,
and reform the j^ople will have, substantially as
they have so numerously petitioned; and though
there could be no great necessity that the commit-
tee should have a clerk, he would raise no objec-
tion, could he be assurred that it would facilitate
the action of the committee in reporting a proper
bill.
In compliance with the pledge which he had
given to the gentleman from Tennessee, [Mr.
Jones,] he (Mr. C.) would now renew the mo-
tion to lay the resolution on the table.
Mr. POTTER appealed to the gentleman to
withdraw the motion.
Mr. CONGER said, it was not within his option
to do so. He had made the motion to lay the
resolution on the table, in accordance with a pledge
lvhich he had himself given to the gentleman from
Tennessee, [Mr. Jones ]
The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman move to
lay the resolution on the table?
Mr. CONGER. 1 am under obligations to do so.
Mr. POTTER appealed to Mr. Jones to autho-
rize the withrawal of the motion.
Mr. JONES assented, on the condition, he said,
that the gentleman would renew the motion.
Mr. POTTER acquiesced.
So the motion to lay the resolution on the table
was again withdrawn.
Mr. POTTER proceeded with his remarks. He
said, that the gentleman who had just taken his
seat had referred to the action of the Committee on
the Post Office and Post Roads upon the fcubjectof
cheap postage. The gentleman probably did not
understand all the difficulties which lay in the way
of an agreement upon the details of such a meas~
: ure. So far as the main features of the bilt were
I concerned, the committee had come to an agree-
j ment; but there were some of the details in respect
