EVANS' BRIGADE, Jackson, July 11, 1863.

Major General S. G. FRENCH, Commanding:

GENERAL: The enemy are erecting a battery, evidently to enfilade our line. It would be well to have cotton bales hauled here to-day, to be put up to-night. I will try to interrupt their party as soon as I can distract the attention of the sharpshooters.

Very truly, yours,

N. G. EVANS,

RAYMOND, July 12, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston, Commanding, &amp;c, Jackson:

The most of my troops, paroled prisoners, will be in Raymond to-day. Stevenson's DIVISION to-morrow. Many of the men are leaving for their homes without authority. Unless you send me orders to the contrary, I shall move via Bovina to Brandon.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, July 12, 1863.

Major-General BRECKINRIDGE:

GENERAL: I have learned with high satisfaction the success of your troops this morning; it increases my confidence in your gallant DIVISION. I beg you to say so it for me. Do me the kindness, also, to express to the First and THIRD Florida, Forty-seventh Georgia, and Fourth Florida Regiments the pride and pleasure with which I have accepted the splendid trophies they have presented me. Assure them that I equally appreciate the soldierly courage and kindly feelings to myself which have gained me these noble compliments.

Respectfully and truly, your obedient servant,

J. E. Johnston,
