it better to adhere to the orders literally rather than to presume there might be an intention to allow me more discretion than was expressed. Nothing authentic has been heard from Brigadier-General Pillow since a short time after he passed through Gadsden, when a number of invalids and badly mounted men of his command were sent back. There are several hundred men of his class, or left behind for other causes, now encamped near this place. I will communicate immediately any further information that may be received.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. T. WALTHALL,

Major, Commanding Post.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Hdqrs. Dept. of Ala., Miss, and East La., Meridian, Miss.:

SIR: After my letter of this date was closed and mailed I received the news contained in the inclosed duplicate of telegram just prepared. It is brought by several men of General Pillow's command who represent themselves to have been engaged in the attack, and of course is to be received with the allowance always due to the statements of fugitives from a battle. These men state that the attack was made about daybreak on Friday morning, the men having dismounted and left their horses about a mile in the rear; that the streets were barricaded with corn-sacks; that the enemy were in the court-house, jail, and other buildings, from which they fired upon our troops with comparative safety; that after three unsuccessful efforts to dislodge them General Pillow was attacked by a large force of cavalry, just then arriving, and his troops thrown into utter confusion, and that the order was given that each man should "take care of himself." They report a heavy loss in officers, among them Colonel Armistead mortally wounded, Majors Lewis and Redwood killed, and Lieutenant-Colonel Hatch wounded.

As La Fayette is at least 125 miles from this place these men must have left the field early and retired with great precipitancy. It is, therefore, to be hoped that further accounts will be more favorable. Two of the fugitives are slightly wounded.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. T. WALTHALL,

Major, Commanding Post.
