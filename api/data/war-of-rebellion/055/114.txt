Major-General REYNOLDS,Chief of Staff, Chattanooga:

Upon the clearing up of the fog, since dispatch at sunrise, we can see the enemy's camps over on the slope of Missionary Ridge and in the valley near there. Our glasses are not strong enough to detect how thickly they are filled. I failed to inform you yesterday that we captured two pieces of artillery and about two thousand stand of small-arms; the latter are scattered over the whole field of yesterday.

Very respectfully,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.
