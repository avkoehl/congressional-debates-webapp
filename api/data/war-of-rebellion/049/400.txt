HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 26, 1863.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL OF THE ARMY,

Washington, D. C.:

SIR: I have the honor herewith to transmit for the information of the General-in-Chief reports from the three division commanders of the Cavalry Corps, to which I beg leave to invite attention, as showing the worn and reduced condition of the cavalry of this army at the present time.

I concur with the commander of the Cavalry Corps in the opinion that the practice of sending the dismounted men to the camp at Washington to be refitted has a most injurious and demoralizing effect upon the service, and I earnestly request that it be discontinued, and that the horses, arms, and equipments that may from time to time be required for the dismounted men of this army be sent out as they are needed.

It is believed that in many instances the men neglect their horses and lose their arms for the purpose of being sent to the Dismounted Camp.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,October 24, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel C. ROSS SMITH:

In obedience to instructions just received, I have the honor to report that I have equipped and available for duty 2,000 men and horses. One-half of these, in my opinion, are not fit for arduous duty, being poor in flesh and leg-weavy. It is impossible to ascertain the number of diseased horses, for the disease is on the increase daily, and to feed them here with grain alone is impossible with my present means of transportation.

The Third Brigade, which crossed at Germanna Mills with 1,488 men to-day, can only turn out 850 men mounted. The First Brigade is better off; can show 1,200 men and fair horses.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. BUFORD,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
