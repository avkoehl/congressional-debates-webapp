SUFFOLK, December 24, 1862.

Major-General DIX:

Is there no way in which at least partial payment can be made to these men before leaving? Gibbs and Spinola both report their men destitute. In my own the families of the men are really suffering, and it seriously affects the spirits of the men in the command.

O. S. FERRY,

Brigadier-General.

FORT MONROE, December 24, 1862.

Brigadier-General FERRY:

I have written to Washington repeatedly in regard to the payment of the troops. The answer is that after the 1st of January they will be paid up to November 1.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
