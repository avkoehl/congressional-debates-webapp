STATE OF OREGON, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Portland, January 16, 1865.

Brigadier General BENJAMIN ALVORD,

Commanding District of Oregon, Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter.:

GENERAL: I had a conversation yesterday with Lieutenant McCall in relation to troubles in Oregon. I do not think there is any occasion for immediate alarm, as I am satisfied no outbreak is contemplated unless a drafte is ordered, and I think a draft can be enforced without bloodshed. The discovery of the plot to fit out a pirate vessel in San Francisco and the arrest of the leaders will have a tendency to check the operations of traitors on this coast.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ADDISON C. GIBBS,

Governor of Oregon.
