GRAVELLY RUN, March 30, 1865.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

The heavy rain of to day will make it impossible for us to do much until it dries up a little or we get roads around our rear repaired. You may therefore leave what cavalry you deem necessary to protect the left and hold such positions as you deem necessary for that purpose, and send the remainder back to Humphreys' Station, where they can get hay and grain. Fifty wagons loaded with forage will be sent to you in the morning. Send an officer back to direct the wagons back to where you want them. Report to me the cavalry you will leave back and the positions you will occupy. Could not your cavalry go back by the way of Stony Creek Depot and destroy or capture the store of supplies there?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

GRAVELLY RUN, March 30, 1865.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

From the information I have previously sent you of Warren's position you will see that he is in danger of being attacked on his left flank in the morning. If such occurs, be prepared to push up with all your force to his assistance. Do not send any of your cavalry to Humphreys' Station to-morrow.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

GRAVELLY RUN, March 30, 1865.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

If your situation in the morning is such as to justify the belief that you can turn the enemy's right with the assistance of a corps of infantry, entirely detached from the balance of the army, I will so detach the Fifth Corps, and place the whole under your command for the operation. Let me know as early in the morning as you can your judgment in the matter, and I will make the necessary orders. Orders have been given Ord, Wright, and Parke to be ready to assault at daylight to-morrow morning. They will not make the assault, however, without further directions. The giving of this order will depend upon receiving confirmation of the withdrawal of a part of the enemy's forces on their front. If this attempt is made it will not be advisable to be detaching troops at such a distance from the field of operations. If the assault is not ordered in the morning, then it can be directed at such time as to come in co-operation with you on the left. Pickett's entire division cannot be in front of your cavalry. Deserters from Steuart's brigade, of that division, came into Humphreys' front this afternoon.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
