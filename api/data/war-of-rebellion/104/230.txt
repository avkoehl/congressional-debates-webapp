Major-General CANBY:

Our firing this evening was excellent. One magazine in the fort was exploded, throwing several men high in the air. We failed to silence the enemy's water battery, which shelled us with great fury. I am closing my trenches near the fort to-night, and to-morrow night will be upon the slope of the fort.
