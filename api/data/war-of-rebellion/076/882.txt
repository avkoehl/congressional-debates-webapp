ATLANTA, GA., July 15, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

Lieutenant-General Polk asked the President to order me to command the Mississippi reserve forces. No reply received. This service don't meet my wishes. I am still awaiting orders. Please answer immediately.

DANIEL RUGGLES,

Brigadier-General.

ATLANTA, GA., July 15, 1864.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

I have the honor to state that in conformity to orders (see copies A and B, inclosed*), I reported to Lieutenant-General Polk, commanding the Army of Mississippi in the field, in advance of Marietta, on the 2nd day of June. Lieutenant-General Polk stated that he had only the reserve forces of the State of Mississippi, which he wished me to organize and command in the field. Thus deprived of an alternative I found myself virtually assigned to a service not in accordance with my wishes. The general stated that he would immediately telegraph and write to the President, recommending my assignment to that service, and he afterward informed me that he had done so. The general instructed me to await orders, at such convenient place in the vicinity of the army as I might select. Being without guards for my horses and baggage (after having been plundered once to a small extent), and unable for the want of transportation to conform to the developments of the campaign, I applied for and obtained authority to come to Atlanta, where I could watch both with greater certainty. After the fall of Lieutenant-General Polk, in the field, I addressed a communication to Major-General Loring, commanding the Army of the Mississippi (see copies C and D, inclosed*), and subsequently referred the subject to Lieutenant-General Stewart, his successor in command, who instructs me to await a reply from the War Department to Lieutenant-General Polk's recommendation. These circumstances will explain the necessity which has deprived me of active participation for a brief period in the prosecution of the present active campaigns against the enemy.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANIEL RUGGLES,

Brigadier-General.

RICHMOND, July 16, 1864.

General J. E. JOHNSTON:

A telegram from Atlanta of yesterday announces that the enemy is extending intrenchments from river toward railroad to Augusta. I wish to hear from you as to present situation, and your plan of operations so specifically as will enable me to anticipate events.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
