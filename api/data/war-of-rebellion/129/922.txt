the case with this institution under its present organization on several occasions. It is almost impossible to obtain materials in the existing condition of the country, and true economy requires us to encounter the hazards of the blockade business that we may draw our supplies from abroad. Another disadvantages to the insut of the number of convictions for short terms. The period is too short for the convict to learn a trade, and his labor is consequently wasteful and unproductive. I trust, gentlemen, that you will correct this evil by increasing the minimum term for which imprisonment in that institution is permitted.

I have exercised the pardoning power with liberality in the short-term cases, especially when the convicts were soldiers or would make such. I thought it better to restore them to their commands or to the enrolling officer, as the case might be, after a confinement sufficiently long to vindicate the majesty of the law, than to protract an unprofitable confinement. A list, however, of the convicts who have been pardoned, with the reasons therefor, will be laid before you.

The mode of supplying the penitentiary through a purchasing agent has been most judicious, and has in a degree protect that institution against the effect of advancing prices. I have found it very difficult to provide proper clothing for the State guard, in consequence of which their appearance is not such as could be desired. I have, however, recently made a temporary arrangement to obviate this difficulty, which I hope will not again occur. A most expensive system existed of supplying the guard with rations, which I deemed it my duty to change. I directed the purchasing agent of the penitentiary to purchase for this organization also, which has been done so satisfactorily as to save a large sum to the treasury. The appropriation need not be as large for the coming year as for that of the preceding one.

I herewith communicate the report of the rector and visitors of the University of Virginia. * It is so full and satisfactory that it requires no comment.

I also lay the report of the Central Lunatic Asylum before you. * I invite attention to its suggestions. One of them is to sanction the purchase of supplies by the obligations of the institutions, payable after the war. This is rather an interesting question, and without entirely adopting the suggestion I commend it to your attention. I regret that this great public charity should feel the influence of an expanding currency in the enlarged appropriation which it needs. You will not, I am sure, refuse it.

The report of the Virginia Military Institute will of course be laid before you. This valuable and interesting institud severely from the inflictions of this war. Her gallant corps of cadets have illustrated their training by conspicuously participating in the hard-fought battle of the 15th day of May, 1864, at New Market, under Major-General Breckinridge, and given a foretaste of what may be confidently expected of them when new fields may demand their valor and maturer manhood may call for its display. Subsequently, however, the advancing power of the enemy swept up the Valley, and in its desolating path destroyed their fine buildings, making it necessary to obtain other quarters. After much difficulty the almshouse near this city, admirably fitted for the purpose, has been obtained, where the exercises of the school will be resumed as soon as the proper preparations can be made.
