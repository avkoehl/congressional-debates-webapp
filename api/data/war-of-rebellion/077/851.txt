Enemy drove in my scouts and pickets yesterday on Mossy Creek road within two miles in this place, when I checked them. They are encamped at Panther Springs, five miles from this place. Strength estimated at 3,500. Shall fall back if pressed it direction of Bull's Gap, and join Colonel Palmer.

I regret to say that my command was stampeded at Morristown this morning. I lost four pieces of artillery. My command is now formed at this place in order. The enemy is in check. The enemy has a superior force to mine, and I suggest that you send re-enforcements to the upper part of East Tennessee for fear I am driven back. Colonel Palmer has now formed a junction with me. I lost a good many men in prisoners.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

The enemy have made no demonstrations this side of Bull's Gap; at least scouts who came from within one mile of that place yesterday report no advance. The enemy have been re-enforced by the Fourth and Eighth Tennessee Infantry and Eighth Ohio, and some think there were some negro troops in the engagement. I had commenced falling back when the enemy pressed my lines and produced the disaster which no one laments more than myself. A great many men thought to be captured are coming into camp. Forty came in yesterday. I am confident that the enemy will advance, if for no other purpose than that of a political effect. I think that troops should be kept well in hand ready for the advance. I would respectfully suggest that they be sent farther to the front.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. C. VAUGHN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
