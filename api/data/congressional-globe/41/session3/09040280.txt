APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[March 3;
Ho. or Beps.
National Military Asylums—Mr. Farnsivorth.
41st Cong.,..3d Sess.
pleasant to look upon under sueh escort, and
with sueh preparations to receive them,, there
could be no doubt whatever, and as the com-
mittee examined no witnesses under oath, and
only inspected such books, accounts, and
papers, &c., as were presented under the direc-
tion of the president and treasurer, it would
have been strange indeed if anything had been
found amiss.
During the present session of Congress, at
my request, several witnesses were subpenaed
and examined by the sub committee, most of
them at the time residents of Washington.
They are B. P. Butler, M. C., president and
treasurer of the asylums, and Mr. Clancy, clerk
ofB. P. Butler, and oftbe reconstruction com-
mittee, B. D. Whitney, another clerk of B. P.
Butler, and clerk ofthe Market-House Com-
pany, &c.; E\ A. Hildreth, brother-in-law of B.
F. Butler and one of the Market-House Com-
pany; Colonel W. H. Wrigel, of Baltimore,
formerly of General Butler's staff; Colonel
Thomas Tabb, of Hampton, Virginia; and
Charles A. Raymond, of Hampton. At my re-
quest Mr. Field, of Lowell, Massachusetts, was
also subpenaed, but wa3 uotiiied by the presi-
dent of the asylums not to attend, and the sub-
committee, upon the opposition of Bctler,
refused to send for him. The reasons for this
extraordinary procedure will appear hereafter.
And now, just at the very close of the Forty-
First Congress, on its very last day, without
affording members an opportunity to examine
the evidence, without opportunity to even see
the report and evidence in print, and all chance
for discussion foreclosed, the chairman of the
sub-committee makes a report, which, under
the circumstances, is a curiosity indeed.
By an act of Congress approved March 3,
1866, these asylums were first incorporated,
but not putin working order until 1860, when,
under the act of March 21 of that year, cer-
tain funds, such as fines, stoppages, forfeit-
ures on account of desertion, &c., were appro-
priated for the establishment of the asylums
and for their endowment. By that act it was
provided in the second section—
"That the board of managers shall bo composed
of the President and Secretary of War and Chief
Justico ol tllo United States, ex officio, during thoir
terms of oflicc, together with nine other citizens of
the United States, not members of Congress," &e.,
"to be selected by joint rosoiution of tbe tionatc and
House of lleprPsentatives immediately after tbe pas-
sago of this act."
By the sixth section of that act it was pro-
vided that the officers of the asylums should
" be appointed from disabled officers" who had
served m the war ofthe rebellion, in pursu-
ance of that act on the Ulst day of April, 1866,
the following joint resolution was adopted:
*' llesolved by the Senate and Home of Representatives
ofthe United tStaten of Ameiica in (Jongresn assembled,
That the following persons be, and they arc hereby,
appointed managers ot the National Asylum lor Dis-
abled Volunteer Soldiers, under the provisions and
conditions of the third soctiou of the act approved
March 23.1SG6: liichard J. Oglesby of Illinois; Hen-
jamin F. Butler ol Massachusetts; and Frederick
Smythe, oi New Hampshire, of the fii&t cla&s, to
serve six yeais; Lewis i>. Gunokel of Ohio; Jay
Cooke of Pennsylvania; and P.Joseph Osterhaus
of Missouri, ot the second class, to serve lour years;
John H. Martindale of New York, Horatio G. Steb-
bins ot California, and E. 15. "Woleottof Wisconsin,
of the third class, to serve two years.
"Approved April 21,18(36."
At that time B. F  Butler was not a *' mem-
ber of Congress/' and he was elected both
president and treasurer of the board of man-
agers, and has ever since held and does now
hold those offices. After he was elected to Con-
gress an act was put through repealing that
provision which prohibited a member of Con-
gress from being one of the board. This fact
is entirely ignored in the report of the com-
mittee. Congress thought it wise when that
act was passed to prohibit a member of Con-
gress from holding another office, where he
could as a Congressman vote money out of
the Treasury and into his own hands as an
officer of an incorporation incorporated by
Congress. But it would seem that Congress
saw in the well-known character of the mem-
ber from Massachusetts [Mr. Butler] such a
guarantee of a disinterested, honest, faithful
discharge of any duty intrusted to him, that
in his special behalf that provision of the
statute was repealed I Whether that was wise
or otherwise, let us see further.
From time to time little joint resolutions
or acts have been slipped through Congress
directing that this fund or that fund be turned
over to the Asylum for Disabled Volunteer
Soldiers. These several amounts were sup-
posed to be insignificant, and as they were
asked in the holy name of charity to needy
and deserving patriots, nobody opposed their
passage. Now,' under these several acts, how
much do you suppose this treasurer-president
member of Congress has drawn from the
Treasury of the United States? Here is a
statement which I have obtaiued from the War
Department and compared with a similar one
from Mr, Treasurer Spinner:
Statement, of amounts drawn on War Department requisitions in favor of the National
Asylum for Disabled Volunteers, Hon. Benjamin F. Butler, President.

Then he received twenty-five acres of land at
Milwaukee, besides several other parcels of land
in different places. Four million six hundred
and eighty-four thousand two hundred and
thirty iivedollarsl This, besides some valuablo
lands and pensions to the amount of over thirty
thousand dollars during the six months ending
the 4th of September last, were paid on account
of aud to inmates of the asylums; how much
before I do not know. This money has all
been drawn by and paid to the president and
and treasurer, B, F. Butler. What has he
done with it? Isayuhe," for it is very evident
that he and his appointees have pretty much
managed the whole affair. None ofthe other
members of the board have been examined by
the committee, and it is quite apparent that
they would have been unable to throw much
light upon the subject if they had been. Then,
I ask again, what has he done with all this
