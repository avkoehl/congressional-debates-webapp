I refer to the great question now stirring the public mind as to the expediency and propriety of bringing to bear against our relentless enemy the element of military strength supposed to be found in our negro population; in other words, and more precisely, the wisdom and sound policy, under existing circumstances, of converting such portions of this population as may be required into soldiers, to aid in maintaining our great struggle for independence and national existence.

The subject is one which recent events have forced upon our attention with intense interest and in my judgment we ought not longer to defer its solution; and although the President in his late annual message has brought it to the attention of Congress, it is manifestly a subject in which the several States of the Confederacy must and ought to act the most prominent part, both estion its proper solution and in carrying out any plan that may be devised on the subject.

As a member of the Virginia Senate, having to act upon the subject, I have given it much earnest and anxious reflection, and I do not hesitate to say here, in advance of the full discussion which it will doubtless undergo, that the general objections to the proposition itself, as well as the practical difficulties in the way of carrying it out, have been greatly lessened as I have more thoroughly examined them.

But it is not to be disguised that public sentiment is greatly divided on the subject; and besides many real objections, a mountain of prejudiices growing out of our ancient modes of regarding the institution of Southern slavery will have to be met an overcome before we can attain to anything like that degree of unanimity so extremely desirable in this and all else connected with our great struggle.

In our former contests for liberty and independence he who was then at the head of our armiies, and who became the Father of his Country, did not hesitate to give his advice on all great subjects involving the success of that contest and the safety and welfare of his country, and in so doing perhaps rendered more essential service than he did in the field; nor do I perceive why, upon such a subject and in such a crisis as the present, we should not have the benefit of your sound judgment and matured wisdom.

Pardon me, therefore, for asking, to be used not only for my own guidance, but publicly as the occasion may requirie, Do you think that by a wisely devised plan and judicious selection negro soldieirs can be made effective and reliable in maintaining this war in behalf of the Southern States?

Do you think the calling into the service of such members of this population as the exigency maay demand would afect injuriously to any aprpeciable or material extent the institution of Southern slavery? Would not the introduction of this element of strength into our military operations justify in somliberal scale of exemptions or details, and by thus relieving from active service in the field a portion of the intelligent and directing labor aof the country (as seems to be needed) haave a beneficial bearing upon the question of subsistence and other supplies?

Would not, in your judgment, the introduction of such a policy increase in other regards our power of defense against the relentless and barbarous warfare the enemy is now waging against us?

These are but some of the leading inquiries which suggest themselves. But I beg you, general, if, from a sense of duty and the prompting of your elevated patriotism, overriding all motives of
