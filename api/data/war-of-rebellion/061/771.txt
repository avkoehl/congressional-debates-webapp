enemy's country, captured and destroyed a train of 35 wagons loaded with stores of great value to the enemy (their paymaster's safe containing over $60,000), destroyed their pontoon bridge over the Saline River, captured and brought to Mount Elba 260 prisoners, nearly 300 horses and mules, and a large number of contrabands, all, including the march of 80 miles to Long View and back, in the surprising short space of twenty-four hours. Our loss throughout the expedition was but 2 killed and 8 missing. The conduct of the officers and men throughout was most gallant and energetic, and deserves the highest commendation. I will take occasion in a special report to make mention of individual cases of meritorious and gallant conduct.

I am, very respectfully,

HEADQUARTERS,Pine Bluff, April 6, 1864.

MAJOR: In connection with my report of the Mount Elba and Long View expedition, I desire to make the following special report of individual cases of gallant and meritorious conduct: I am indebted to Lieutenant-Colonel Jenkins, of the Fifth Kansas Cavalry, and Lieutenant-Colonel Marks, of the Eighteenth Illinois Cavalry, and the skillful and gallant manner in which they met and repulsed the enemy at Mount Elba. With about 600 men they engaged and defeated about 1,500 of the enemy. Major Walker and Scudder, of the Fifth Kansas Cavalry, are entitled to great credit for their gallantry in following and harassing the enemy with a force of about 100 men after his defeat at Mount Elba. Lieutenants Greathouse, of the First Indiana Cavalry, and Young, of the Fifth Kansas Cavalry, are deserving of the highest praise for the masterly manner in which they created a diversion in the direction of Monticello, and more especially for their gallantry, energy, and skill in the execution of the raid to Long View and return, the particulars of which are detailed in my official report of the Mount Elba and Long View expedition. Captain Barnes, of the Fifth Kansas Cavalry, has placed me under obligations to him for valuable assistance in the construction of the pontoon bridge across the Saline, which was under his immediate charge. He is also entitled to credit for his promptness in discovering the enemy previous to his attack upon Mount Elba and his endeavors to hold him in check. Sergeant Davis, of the Fifth Kansas Cavalry, in command of a section of mountain howitzers, deserves much credit for his coolness and courage in the time of greatest danger and for the skillful manner in which he managed his guns. Major Owen, commanding First Indiana Cavalry; Major Spellman, commanding Seventh Missouri Cavalry, and Captain Smith, commanding detachment Twenty-eight Wisconsin Infantry, are all entitled to honorable mention for energetic and meritorious conduct generally.

I am, very respectfully,

POWELL CLAYTON,

Colonel, Commanding.
