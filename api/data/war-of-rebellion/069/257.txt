orders of the commanding general without going through that column. My information as to the position of the troops is necessarily obtained from officers in charge of the movement, and I deem it quite as reliable as that received by the commanding general from like sources until the certainty is established. I am not in the habit of making reports inconsistent with the facts of the case, and cannot permit any person to make such insinuations.

General S. WILLIAMS:

Potter and Crittenden are across and their pickets are being withdrawn. Willcox still in position. Do you know anything of the progress of Warren or Wright?

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Commanding Ninth Crops:

The headquarters are at Mangohick Church. The route of the Fifth Corps and the Ninth Corps will probably be modified so that to-morrow they will move to Hanovertown instead of New Castle. General Wright is moving to a point 3 or 4 miles above Hanovertown by a route that turns off from the ridge road. These headquarters are about 2 miles back from here. The commanding general directs that you encamp for the night in rear of the Fifth Corps and follow it to-morrow. It is directed to move as soon after daylight as practicable.
