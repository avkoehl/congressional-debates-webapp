Colonel CRITCHER:

If you have not already done so, send a company of cavalry at once, with orders to scout thorougly the country, intervening between the head of York River and your present right, thus connecting your right with Colonel Shingler's left upon the lower Pamunkey. Make arrangements so that important information may be promptly sent to these headquarters via the nearest telegraph station. Let me hear from you.
