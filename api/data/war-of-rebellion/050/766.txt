I could not see beyond the ridge mentioned, but from the smokes believe them to be only a small force there, say two or three brigades.

Artillery was seen to come down the road from Missionary Ridge as I approached, as if to be placed in position to check my advance.

My casualties were 1 killed and 5 wounded.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. B. HAZEN,

Brigadier-General.

Captain W. D. NORTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant General.

[First Indorsement.]

Respectfully forwarded.

The orders for the movement were received at 2.45 p.m., and commenced as soon as possible. Details for fatigue were out and had to be recalled. General Hazen was withdrawn, as there was, at the time, not daylight for farther advance, and because the party of the Fourteenth Corps had returned.

J. M. PALMER,

Major-General.

[Second Indorsement.]

Respectfully forwarded.

The reconnaissance was very handsomely conducted by General HAzen, and he got back, as ordered, just at dark.
