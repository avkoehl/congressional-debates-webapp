I may yet move one division two miles this evening. The corps will start at 5 a.m. to-morrow, and push forward as vigorously as possible.

Brevet Major-General WILSON,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: I have received a note from General Thomas, in which he directs that I move on to your support, and that your train follow after my troops and my train after yours. Please give the necessary instructions to have your train so move. Owing to the difficulty of getting rations from Pulaski to camp, it may be noon before we can get them issued; immediately afterward I will march. I suggest that you send a regiment to Elk River for the purpose of cutting trees and filling the stream full, in order they may float down and destroy the enemy's pontoon bridge over the Tennessee River.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

TH. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
