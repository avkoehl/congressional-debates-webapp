HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,

Selma, Ala., July 7, 1865.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Montevallo:

SIR: It has been represented to these headquarters that there is a large class of destitute persons living near Lime Kiln Station who cannot come to Montevallo for subsistence, having no means of transportation. It is also represented that a large number of persons are receiving supplies who are unworthy and who are trampling upon the generosity of the Government in her effort to relieve the suffering destitute. It is desired that you cut off all who should supply themselves and extend the supplies to those who are absolutely suffering. If possible send your issuing officer occasionally to Lime Kiln Station to make issues to the suffering destitute in that part of the country. Will you also please furnish these headquarters, at the earliest practicable moment, with a report of the amount of supplies you have received for this point, the number of families you have supplied, the number of persons to whom you have issued supplies, and the average amount of each kind of issue you have made to each person? This is necessary in order to make up a report, which we are required to make.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. H. F. RANDALL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
