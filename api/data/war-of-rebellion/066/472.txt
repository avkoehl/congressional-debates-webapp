HDQRS. DEPT. OF S. CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., May 4, 1864.

Colonel ALFRED RHETT:

COLONEL: I have the honor to inform you by direction of the major-general commanding, that you must place the Twenty-eight Georgia Regiment under marching orders without delay, with three days rations of hard bread and bacon. A portion of Colquitt's brigade will probably leave to-morrow and the remainder next day. Every endeavor will be made to supply the deficiencies in arms of the Georgia Volunteers. Major-General Jones has decided that Captain Mitchel, of the First South Carolina Artillery, shall relieve Colonel Elliott in the command of Fort Sumter temporarily.

I inclose you a copy of an intercepted dispatch* from the enemy's fleet. I also communicated it to Flag-Officer Tucker, who suggests that all small boats engaged in fishing, crabbing, or attached to wood-craft or steamers, and all other boats plying about the harbor, be placed in some slip at sunset in charge of a guard, and kept there until after daylight the following morning.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. FEILDEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., May 4, 1864.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY, Mount Pleasant:

The Twentieth will remain, but the Nineteenth Georgia will be sent as soon as transportation can be provided. Put it under orders in its present position.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., May 4, 1864-1 a. m.

Brigadier General HENRY A. WISE, Adam's Run, S. C.:

Use every exertion to muster your men; the call is urgent; the rendezvous designated I approve of; transportation will be awaiting you whenever you inform me you are ready; take three days' rations or more if you consider necessary; I hope to start the Twenty-sixth and Fifty-ninth [Virginia] to-morrow morning; I will tell you to-morrow what transportation can be taken.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
