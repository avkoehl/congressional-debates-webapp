CITY POINT, Va., March 24, 1865.

Major General E. O. C. ORD,

Commanding Army of the James:

A dispatch from General Sheridan of Tuesday said that he would be able to start from White House on Saturday, and that he would come by Jones' Bridge, if practicable. He had sent an officer to examine the route and would report to me. If he comes by that route, he though he would require no co-operation from your troops. I have not heard from him since, and have deferred giving orders in consequence. In the absence of further instructions you may move out to-morrow and open the route by Long Bridge in the manner proposed in your note of this date. As there is no intention of using Botton's Bridge, there is no necessity of risking detachments of troops there.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., March 24, 1865-2 p. m.

Major-General ORD:

I spoke to Commodore Radford about sending gun-boats up the Chickahominy when Sheridan started to cross. I believe he made all the preparations to do so. It can have no special protecting advantage to have the navy go up, as they cannot ascend to the point of crossing; but it may be desirable to see what is going on, and whilst the troops are crossing it will be safe to make it. Sheridan will encamp to-morrow night on the Chickahominy. Please send this to Admiral Porter.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
