Mr. HAMILTON, of Maryland. I move
that the Senate adjourn.
Mr. CAMERON. I wish the Senator would
allow me a few minutes' time to make a state-
ment and pass a little bill.
Mr. HAMILTON, of Maryland. To pass
a bill?
Mr. CAMERON. Yes, sir.
Mr. HAMILTON, of Maryland. I do not
give way for that purpose. I insist on my
motion.
Mr. CAMERON. I think if the Senator
will hear me he will agree to wait a moment
before pushing his motion.
Mr. HAMILTON, of Maryland. Very well;
I will hear what the Senator has to say.
Mr. CAMERON. At the close of the last
session of Congress I got up a little bill to
relieve an honest man from a liability im-
posed upon him by no act of his own. The
bill had passed the other House and had been
approved by the proper Department, and we
were about to pass it when the hand of yonder
clock reached the proper hour for adjourn-
ment. One moment more would have allowed
the passage of the bill ; for there was no oppo-
sition to it. This session is now drawing to
its close, and I appeal to the Senate to take
up that bill. It is a bill for the relief of Mr.
Biigham, postmaster at Franklin, Pennsylva-
nia; and I will state the facts.
Mr. Brigham was postmaster at the town of
Franklin, and was directed by the Treasury
Department to deposit the money received by
him in a particular bank, which was a Govern-
ment depository. In the course of time the
bank broke, at the time of the great Culver
failure, and the Government lost $2,500. The
Treasury Department have absolved Mr. Brig-
ham from all wrong and have, refcommended
that he shall be released; but "his bail are still
held in the sum of $2,500. The bill is to re-
lieve that, responsibility. It is on the Calendar,
and would have passed at the last session if
the time of adjournment had been delayed one
moment longer.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Secretary
informs the Chair that he-is not able to find
the bill to which the Senator refers.
Mr. CAMERON. I send up the Calendar
containing the bill.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Secretary
informs the Chair that the bill alluded to by
the Senator from Pennsylvania has passed.-
Mr. CAMERON. I am very glad to hear it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill to which
the Secretary understands the Senator torefer,
for the relief of Qnackenbush, has passed.
Mr. HAMILTON, of Maryland. I renew
my motion-
Mr. HOWARD. If the Senator will with-
draw the motion for a moment, I should like
verv much to have a short executive session.
Mr. HAMILTON, of Maryland. Very well.
Mr. HOWARD. I move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of executive busi-
ness.
The motion was agreed to; and after five
minutes spent in executive session, the doors
were reopened, and the Senate (at four o'clock
and twenty-five minutes p. m,) ac^'onmed.
