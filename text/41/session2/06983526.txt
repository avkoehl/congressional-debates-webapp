THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

ried as before to a greater extent in American
bottoms and under the American flag. Until
some such great reforms as these are pat into
practical operation, until we come down to
specie prices, until we have public and pri-
vate economy, until we have legitimate com-
merce founded upon the actual capital of the
country, until we take measures to develop a
greater field for the operations of the commer-
cial marine, until we adapt ourselves commer-
cially to this new order of things created by the
great revolution in steamy (which has made
throughout the world within the last few years
greater changes than were ever known before
in the world's history,) we shall have no sub-
stantial and permanent change for the better
in the navigating interests of the country.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. Neither
the country nor this House needs to be told that
our foreign commerce is nearly destroyed.
Nor is it necessary to go at length into the
causes of its destruction. It is well known that
ourpresenthumiliating position upon the ocean
is due in the main to the fact that during the late
rebellion piratical cruisers built andmanned
in Qreat Britain, and armed with British guns,
and leaving British ports under the British
flag, were let loose on the ocean to destroy
our commerce. They were in all respects Brit-
ish vessels except in having a southern rebel
for commander. All this was done with the
knowledge and consent of t lie authorities of
Great Britain, whose object was to weaken us
as a nation and to obtain a monopoly of the
commerce of the world. This was done in a
manner so shameless that Richard Cobden
declared in Parliament that—
"You have been carrying on war from these shores
against the United States, and have been inflicting
an amount of damage on that country greater than
would have been produced by many ordinary wars."
And John Bright, said of the conduct.of
Great Britain:,
"Wo supply the ships, we supply tho arms, the
munitions of war: we give aid and oomfort to the
loulest of crimes. Englishmen only do it."
Why were we thus treated by Great Britain
in our hour of trouble? There was published
in London a few weeks ago by the Messrs.
Longman two volumes of " Selections from
Speeches of Earl Russell, 1817 to 1841, and
from Dispatches from 1859 to 1865, with Intro-
ductions." In these volumes Earl Russell has
seen proper to append a lengthy commentary
explaining his dispatches.
Let me put two passages side by side.
"The Government of Lord Palmerston and the
people of Great Britain took the course which was
required by a regard for their own honor, by the sen-
timents of sincere friendship which they entertained
for the TJuited States, an-1 by a deep sense of their
international duties."— Vol. 2, page 248.
"Hence, when there is a Strong popular feeling,
such as prevailed in the United States in behalf of
tli e South American insurgents, and in a British port,
and a portion of the British public on behalf of the
confederate States, it becomesamatterofthegravest
difljeulty to convict persons of offenses against the
foreign enlistment law. This difficulty a.rises by rea-
son ofthe unwillingness of those who sympathize with
the offenders to come forward and give evidence, the
unwillingness judges to press the law, and the
reluctance of juries to convict persons who ha^e their
sympathy." * * * * "These difficulties,
were felt by the British' Government when complaint
was made that vessels were being .fitted oat in the
Mersey and the Clyde to prey upon the commerce !
of the United States."
Further on in his commentary on his dis-
patches he says that— \
. "During the discussions on the <juestion3 relating
to the Alabama and the Shenandoah it was tho great
object of the British Government to preserve for the
subject the security of the trial by jury and for. the
nation the legitimate business of ship-building." |
Notwithstanding all present professions of
friendship, could anything be said of Great J
Britain more damaging than these avowals of i
Earl Russell? What he says about trial by
jury is simply nonsense, as no one had attacked j
the right of trial by jury. We have here the
barefaced confession of the English minister
that their "great object was to preserve for
the nation the legitimate and lucrative busi-
ness of ship-building." In this he no doubt
speaks truly. That was one of the objects of
Great Britain, and to secure that object it was
necessary that our shipping and our ship-yards
should be destroyed. Our Government was
then at stake, and the question was whether a
"Government of the people, for the people,
and by the people, should perish from the
earth."
While this issue was being wrought out in
blood and carnage, we well knew where existed
British sympathy and aid. Ship building was
lucrative, and Lord John wanted to preserve
it for the British nation. It was "lucrative "
to build pirates to destroy our ships, and it
would be lucrative to build more ships to re-
place those destroyed, and still more lucrative
if those destroyed were not rebuilt and they
were left the carrying trade.
Our ships having been destroyed, shall we
surrender to our destroyer the commerce of
the world and the mastery of the seas, or shall
we attemptto regain our position on the ocean
by giving hex the. "lucrative" job of building
our ships? I answer that we should do neither,
but that national honor, a just resentment of
unparalleled wrongs, public interest, and our
future welfare all demand that we should as-
sume a position of independence of that nation
which in our hour of trial and deep distress
sought our destruction. If it were but a ques-
tion of to-day, and only the matters of dollars
and cents were concerned, I might, perhaps,
admit the force of the many able arguments in
favor of free ships. It is a question of the
greatest national importance reaching far be-
yond to-day, and we ought not to be afraid to
meet it, and to apply such remedies as will
restore to the country, if not its commercial
supremacy, at least a respectable position on
the ocean.
It can be done; it must be done, or we are
a dishonored nation. To the question how
it should best be done the special committee
has devoted itself. They find the subject full
of difficulties, and they have endeavored to
surmount them as best they could. They have
found great diversity of opinion as to what is the
best policy to pursue, and men that to-day peti-
tion Congress to adopt the bill reported by our
committee are found to-morrow sending to the
Senate a remonstrance against it. Such utter
trifling among some of the men engaged in the
shipping business as has been disclosed is most
discouraging, and is well calculated to disgust
those who would gladly do something to lift the
shipping of the country out of the " slough of
despond." I hold in my hands a copy of a re-
monstrance introduced into the Senate, signed,
already signed a petition in favor of thf> bill
now before the House, and that many others
belonged to foreign shipping houses, pnre and
simple, and the balance not ship-owners at all.
I cannot but believe that the gentlemen who
signed this remonstrance, who are really Ameri-
cans, did so under a misapprehension of what
they were signing. To suppose otherwise would
be to regard them as a trifling set, unworthy
of notice. The only opposition to this bill is
that New York remonstrance. The most of
the persons who signed that remonstrance are
members of the New York Chamber of Com-
merce, which body has sent us the strongest
kind of an indorsement of the bill. That the
English houses who signed the remonstrance
knewwhatthey were about we may well believe.
Of course John Bull does not want this bill to
pass.
At almost every step in the progress of their
investigations the committee has been able to
trace out the causes of the decadence of Ameri-
can ship-building and American commerce,
until it has reached its present condition ; for
though the substitution of iron for wood was
working a great change in ship-building be-
fore the war, we should readily have con-
formed to that change, and with our labor
question undisturbed, and with our currency
on a specie basis, we could have kept pace
with Great Britain in building iron ships; but
this became impossible with British cruisers
engaged in their destruction, and with the dis-
turbed condition of our labor and currency ;
and it is now rendered absolutely certain that
nothing short of Government aid, either in
drawbacks, subsidies, or differential duties,
can put ships afloat to compete with the Power
that has driven them from the ocean. To what
extent that aid shall be given, if given at all,
is for Congress to decide. Before the war the
commerce of the whole world was carried
on by about, seventeen million tons, of which
nearly one third belonged to us, and our ton-
nage was within a trifle equal to that of Great
Britain. To bo entirely accurate, I should
say that our tonnage engaged in the foreign
carrying trade reached its highest point in 1861,
when it amounted to 2,642,628 tons, -while
that of Great Britain at the same time was
3,179,683 tons. From 1850 to 1860, our ton-
nage in the foreign trade had increased 60 per
cent., and had it gone on to increase from 1860
to 1870, at the same ratio, which is not prob-
able, had there been no disturbance, it would
now reach 4,228,204 tons; but instead of that
it had fallen in 1866 to 1,492,926 tons, or a loss
of 1,149,902 tons, while Great Britain had ia-
or purporting to be signed, by a large number of creased over thirty per cent, during the same
"American ship owners," in New York. An period. The following tables present in the
examination of this remonstranefe discloses the most striking form the rise and tall of our mer-
remarkable fact that many of the signers had cantile marine, and tell the whole story:

Now, as to how far the Government should
go in extending aid to rebuilding up our mer-
cantile marine there doubtless will be much
difference of opinion. The views of the com-
mittee you have in the bills now before the
House. I do not profess to be very sanguine
that if enacted into a law they will accomplish
all that could be desired. That they will be
of material assistance there can be no doubt,
but whether such laws will enable us to suc-
cessfully compete with long-established and
subsidized lines ia more than doubtful, and to
enable us to put afloat lines to compete with
existing lines crossing the Atlantic something
