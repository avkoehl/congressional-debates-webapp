you that the general wishes notified to be ready to go with the party to-night. Captain Williams commands an independent company of rangers. Colonel Ohr will probably know something of him. In case the Second Missouri are not notified that they are to go to the Cadron please have them get ready. The Tenth Illinois Cavalry are ordered to cross the river and report to you. They are to go into camp in or near the quarters formerly occupied by the Sixty-second Illinois Infantry. Be sure and have Captain Williams ready, also the Merrill Horse.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE FRONTIER,Fort Smith, Ark., May 25, 1864.

Major General F. STEELE,

Commanding Department of Arkansas:

DEAR SIR: I have sent a sufficient force to Clarksville under Cloud to head Shelby if he is driven back. My last information is that he went toward Batesville. I have nothing new from the south except rumors of Maxey or Cooper coming this way, for which I am prepared. The river is now rising quite rapidly. I want all the boats to be sent back as soon as possible; all should be sent that can be spared, as it may be the last rise. I will endeavor to protect the boats this side of Dardanelle.

Very truly, yours,

JOHN M. THAYER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,Vicksburg, Miss., May 25, 1864.

Brigadier General N. B. BUFORD,
