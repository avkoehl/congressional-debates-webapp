as that no member should violate the rules of this
body, and the same in relation to the presiding
office-- If the paper was consistent with the rules
of the Senate, he would present it If it contained
charges aga'nstthis body, it was hisduty to with-
hold it What, then, was to be done? The right
of petition was sacred, and one which could not
be infiinged, and what was to be done in this in-
stance' The presiding officer had a duty to per-
form. A Senator is attacked in a way which the
presiding officer would not allow from one of his
compeers on the floor, and the Senators interested
had a right to stnke out the offensive matter, so
.far as it could be done consistently with presei virg
and «securing to the people thegreat right of petition.
Was not the Senate light to correct and regulate
its proceedings so as to secure their own dignity'
Has it nota right to protect itself against abuses'
Without infringing the rights of the people, it may
receive the paper, and direct it to a committee, to
expunge the tfbjectiorable matter
Mr KING, of Alabama, said, that a few days
ago a veiy offensive memorial, containing highly
derogatory expressions, was presented by some
gentleman and objected to. We were then met
by the gentleman from Mississippi, [Mi Pora-
dextcr,] and told that the language there used
was the court language, and, therefore, proper to
be used in a memorial Now, that gentleman ob-
jects to this memorial because the matter is offen-
sive, charging corruption to gentlemen of this
body He (Mr K ) had looked into the paper,
and except the part which had been struck out,
he perceived no direct or positive charges The
statements were altogether geneial, and not neai
so exceptionable as some lesolutions which liad
been offered by the gentlemen here on their own
íesponsibihty. [Mr K here read the resolution
alluded to from the meeting of tin plate workeis
in Philadelphia ] Now, what could the genJe-
men say upon this paper, when we had íeceived
memorials and resoldtionshere, calculated to throw
discredit on the Chief Magistrate of the nation
and the presiding officer of this body' What was
the charactei of this memonal, or lather preamble,
for it was no part of the pioceedings, the resolu-
tions only having passed which embody what the
memorialists have in view' It was customaiy,
jnpresentingmeironals, when there weieoflensive
remaiks in them against any member of Congiess,
to strike a pen across them, because it was not
violating or affecting the objects sought to be
attained                                                                           j
He did not agree with the gentleman from |.
South Carolina, [Mr Calhoun,] that it was a
question as to the reception of the paper The
rule of the Senate requires the contents of a me-
morial to oe br'eñy stated, bjt when it is lead,
it is in possession of the Senate By the Manual,
the silence of the House, or dispensing with the
foimahty of reading, was a leception of it He
v;as surprised at the honorab'e gentleman fiom

the course which had been pursued by the hon-
orable Senators fiom Pennsylvania Nothing had
been done, but what was pioper to be done It
was nothing but expungirg the offensive matter
And he would entei his protest against any attemnt
to influence the public mind that any oflicei of the
Senate had any disposition to change a memorial
presented heie
Mr WRIGHT said he rose to state a fact, as
he thought bearing directly upon what had been
haidily teimed the mutla'ion of the piper now
under consideration, and he did it under a convic-
tion that he was bound to do it as an act of justice
to the presiding officer A few uays ago a memo
rial from the State of New Yoik, fiom the county
of Win en, mthat ¡state, was ttansmi'ted to an
honoiaWe benator not f-om thet Sra e, with me
qi est that he would piesent it to the Set ate, that
Konmable Sent tor, upon examining the memorial,
fourd in it a clause which he consideied as con-
tain! .- offensive matte, (said M, W )^"^
himself The honoiable Senatoi, as he (Vil W )
subsequently learned from him, handed the me-
monal to a member of Congress «rom that State,
being in the vicinity of the petitioners,  id told tl at
member of Confess, if he conside-ed 1 .mself au-
thored to strike out of the memorial the offensive
( a. se, he should be w.lhng to comply with the
1 equest of the petitione' s, and pi esent the r aper to
the Senate, but unless that was done, he must
decline to present the memorial The member took
his pen and struck out the exceptionable clause,
and in that shape the paper was presented by the
Senator, received by the Senate, read, referred, and
printed, and in that shape it is now upon our files
It was not the memorial which was sent here, but
it was that memorial, altered as he had related
He (Mr W ) met the presiding officer this morn-
ing, and in a casual conveisation he mentioned
to Mr W his embarrassment in relation to the
papei now before the Senate, in consequence of the
offensive remarks contained in it towaids a mem-
ber of this body, and he (Mr W ) related to him
the circumstances which he had just detailed to
the Senate He did not doubt that this conver-
sation might have induced the presiding officei's
suggestion to the honorable Senators from the
State from which this papei comes, and might have
influenced them in striking out theparagraph fiom
this paper
Now, withouf having entertained a thought that
the Senator, in the case he had related, had done
an improper act, or made an improper suggestion,
in speaking to the member of the other House
as to striking out the offensive matter from the
memonal.thetiansaction furnished conclusive evi-
dence to his mmd that the Senator's motives were
highly honorable, and personal'y he felt under the
strongest obligations to him for the course he had
pursued
He would add one word more in reference to
what had fallen fiom the Senator from South Car-
olina, [Mr Preston ] He (Mr W ) always un- I
derstood heretofoie, and still did, that every mem
ber of this body was íesponsible for any paper |
he presented to this body, and that the piesiding
officer was equally responsible for papers he pre-
sented to the Senate, but Mr W. did not under-
stand that papers directed to the presiding officei,
with a request that he will lay them before the
Senate, were any more in the possession of this
body than papers thus sent to any other member
of the body, and he, therefore, supposed that the
Lístame of the alteration of a paper, which he had
i elated, was in all respects paiallel to the case now
before the Senate Any attempt to distinguish the
cases does not seem to be possible
Mr WEBSTER having suggested that if the
Vice President now believed that the paper was
one which ought not to have been presented to the
Senate, the Senate ought to grant him leave to
withdraw it He merely made the suggestion upon
tl e supposition that the pi esidmg officer was satis-
fied the paper was exceptionable, and such a one
as ought not to have been presented
When the debate closed, and before putting the
question o*i the motion made by Mi   Clat that
the memonal should not be received, the VICE
[ PRESIDENT rose and obseived in substance—
That it was with much regret that the Chair felt
itself compelled to detain the Senate at so late an
houi by any observations of us own, upon a sub-
I |ect which had been already so fu'ly discussed
" ut aj the question to be decided was m its nature
ne of order, in respect to which it was not only
the sense of the Senate on any question of order.
This latter provision is peculiar to this body, and
its rules are, in that respect, unlike those of the
other branch of the Eegislatuie But little con-
versant with questions of order, and anxious to
regulate its course by the best lights that could be
obtained, the Chan thought it proper, at an early
day, to look into the practical interpretation which
had been given to the authority thus conferred on
it by those who had preceded the present incum-
bent in the occupation of the chair Upon that
examination it was found thatit had geneially been
the practice of the Chair, and especially upon im-
portant points of order, to take the sense of the
Senate miespect to them in the first instance,when-
ever there was, in its judgment, sufficient question
as to the propei course of proceeding to render such
a step advisable. Having regard to the character
and construction of the body, this mode of proceed-
ing appeared to the pi esidmg officer to be not only
discreet in itself, but he thought it would give to
this peculiar provision an effect more conformable
to the respect which was justly due to the Senate
from a presiding officer not chosen by itself The
Chair, theiefore, felt no difficulty in adopting itas
a íule for its own conduct Why that course could
not be pursued upon the first presentation of the
papers in question, consistently with other and
paramount considerations, and why it is not only
most proper, but highly desirable, that the sense
of the Senate should now be taken upon the im-
mediate question before it, he trusted would be
made quite obvious in the succeeding observations,
which he felt it his duty to submit
The subject matter out of which the present
question has arisen, presents two points for decis-
ion, that is to say, fiist, Does a communication
intended to be laid before the Senate through the
j medium of the presiding officer, from the moment
1 of its reception by the Chan, become, ipso facto,
as is contended, the property and part of the ar-
I chives of the Senate, so as to deprive the Chair of
all discretion, as to the disposition to be made of
it, without the approbation of the body' And, if
I that be not the case, then, secondly, Under what
responsibility does the Chair rest to the Senate,
in regard to the character of the communications
I which it suffers  to reach the body through its
agency.
1     These are certainly questions of a very grave
character, well deserving the deliberate considera-
tion of the Senate    They are questions in respect
to which there would seem to be a diversity of
opinion among the members, and it is certainly
fai fiom being the intention of the Chair to pass,
in this form,uponthecoirectnessof the conflicting
deductions which have, in this respect, been drawn
from the premises before us, by honorable Sena-
tors    its only purpose is, to state its own views,
and in doing so, it feels that it may safely assume,
that if it be correct to say that the Chair has no
liuhtful author ty over communications addressed
to°it foi the use of the Senate, no right to return
them to those from whom they came, to deliver
them over to their íepresentative on this floor, and
withhold them from the Senate, then most clearly
nroner in I'.eV, but confo.mable also to parliament I the Chan cannot be held responsible for the con-
aVusa-e for the Chair to take a part, he felt it I tents of any paper thus presented I can only be
due as well to the Senate as to the Chair, to state necessary to state this proposition, to lender the

couise had been influenced m the part cular case    — ^- .-^i^.v^nestc-irmcitv.íindtosecuD
now hefore the S'nate, but also the genera! prin-
ciples which the Chan had adopted for its govern- ,
ment in record to the subject-matter out of which
it had arisen     He be'ieved such a couise on his ¡
part necessary to a correct undeistandirg of the j
immediate question under qiscu-í ioo, and itiat it
