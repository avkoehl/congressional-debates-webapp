Whereas the uninterrupted navigation of the Ohio river at
all seasons of the 3 ear is an objec of the fl rst importance to the
commerce of the Western and Southwestern States and ofthe
nation, and deeply affecting the public works of Pennsylvania,
which have been constructed at an enormous cost to our cm
zens, and whereas it is believed entnely piacticable, by the re-
moval of obstructions and clearing the channels of said river,
to secure a safe, easy, and constant navigation for steamboats
at all seasons wjhen it is free from ice and whereas the resources
and constitutional resources ofthe Geneial Government ate
fully adequate to the execution of a work of such great national
importance

INTERCOURSE WITH FOREIGN NATIONS
The pending question whs  on the motion o/ Mr   I ink to
strike out so much of the following item as velates to the mission
io Mexico                                      *
"No 218 For salaries ofthe Ministers of the United States to
Great Btitam, Fiance, Russia, Prussia, Austna, Spam, Mexico
and Biazil, seventy two thousand dollars "
Mr WILLIAM BUTLER, of Squth Carolina wai entitled to
the floor, but yielded at the requegjt of Mi WISE for purposes
of explanation
Mi WISE then replied to certii^ charges made hy Mr ^lade
yesterday, that General Waddy Thompson was unfit to be the
lepiesentative of the United St ates ¿at Mexico, by reason first oi
his personal temper, and, secondly, of his opinions in relation
to this mission
Mr W defended the General against both these charges As
to the first charge, Mi W said, that if the gentleman fi om Vei
montiMr Slade] had known Geneial Thompson ashe(Mr
W.) had known him in his private relations, he [Mr S ] would
heai teatimony, as Mr W did, in contradiction io the asser
tions made In all hi' intercourse he (Mr W ) had never known
a more bland and kind heaited man. He was accomplished m
his manners as a gentleman, and m hi& address he was much
more distinguished for the suavitei than the forliter Mr W
denied that the gertleman from Vermont had ever been the as
sociateofGen Thompsoo,or had even had such an intimate
personal acquaintance with him as to ena! lelum to judge what
the peisonal temper of the gentleman was though it was well
known that he [Mr Slade] had felt the spear and the lance of
that gentleman on this floor
Mi W vindicated also the opinions of Gen Thompson, and
his fitness in that respect also for the mission to which he had
been appointed.
Mr WM BU TLER of South Carohm, said the debate had
assumed such a character that it appeared to h rn that he wis
lequired tosay something in defence of ins predecessor on this
floor the present Mimstei to Mexico, in reply to the gentleman
fiom Vermont[Mr Slade Hewievei> sorry that the gentle
man was not now in his seat because he wished especially to
pay his respects to him and ask him some questions relative to
the Minister to Mexico
The piopositnn tnstuke off this mission was brought for
waul at a time least suited to the purpose When we had many
important and serious negotiations between this country and
Mexico, the gentleman fiom New York [Mr I inn] saw so far
as to conclude that, by the agency < f the Minister to Mexico,
Texas might be annexed io the Union and had made the motion
to strike out the appropriation for his salary Many of our
citizens had claims on the Mexican Government, many of
whish had been awarded by a commi sion in this city and de
cidedto be just In addition to this, we had citizens wearing the
badge of intamy and working mthe streets of Mexico The
American Gov ernmentwas hound to froteetits citizens at home
and abroad, anil, if ever theie was a time when it was im
portant that a mmistei should be at that po t this appeared to
be the time
He had listened with astonishment at the piopo=iuon, coming
fiom tru, q larterlt did Iff thought it exhibited in adjusting
questions between this and foieian Governments an ill tempei
ed feeling If there was ever time when eveiy member of this
House, fiom whatevu sectnn he came, should forect his sec
tumal feeh igs, when the hoooi of the country was concerned,
this wai the time when it should be done, but this proposition
exhibited that th^ve were stiong sectional feelings uppermost m
the minds of gentlemen, m 1 an ill tempei towards the  outh
This was the time when a representative of this country
should beat Mexico to watch the course of events, andieport
them truly and faithfully At this time, when this petty tyrant
was marching to invade Texas aided by British gold and British
influence the proposition was to withdiaw our miniate!'
Whatever might be the sympathies of a certain class of gentle
men heie and elsewhere, whether they might or might not be
enlwted on thefide ofthe tyrant of Mexico, his feelings were
enlisted in behalf of that gallant people of Tex^s who, by their
sufferings, theirhardships, and their bravery had entitled them
selves to the consideration of the civilized woild Ihe gentle
man from New York had founded his belief only on the delusive
and ill natured feelings that governed him on all occasions
His object in rising was mainly to reply to some remarks m
vindication of his predeeessor from an assault on his character
by the gentlemap from Vermont, [Mr &LAnE ] He was sorry
that that gentleman was not m his seat The gentleman was a
coot and calculating man, who approached a subject with care
and caution He regietted that on this occasion he had felt it
his duty to have so far forgot what was due to an American,
cidzeuas to have taken the advantage of his position to have as-
sailed an absent gentleman Magnanimity would appear to
haverequned fiom him that he should have made an open at
tack, aboveboaid, and in the presence of the gentleman who
might thus have insulted him He saw the gentleman very
seldom excited, but on every occasion in which opportunity
piesented itself, he indulged in most violent, ill tempered abuse
of the South and her institutions
He knew nothing ofthe instructions given to the present mi-
nister to Mexico, hut hoped they were of such a character aft
to require immediately thedehvery of all our citizens now con*
fined in Mexico—that they were positive and peiemptory, and
if the demand is rv complied with, that the next negotiator to
besentm ghtb° one of our^quadions commanded by one of our
gailant navy orneéis, he would wish to see them off Vera Cruz,
and he would trust to their honoi to effectthe lelease of our
people which negetiation had failed to do He knew nothing of
the President's opinions, whethei or not they were in favor of
theannexation of Tex<-&, if so, and if he could accomplish the
object, he shnu J regard him worthy of the highest honor in
the manner Florida was obtained fiom Spam, Santa Anna
would be very glad to dispose of Texas, and this Government
mightpuicl ase heron the eameteim=
With resr ect to the invasion by tho Mexicans ind the subju-
gation of Texas, the greater probability was that Texas, with
hei ^inglesiar would march to Mexicoif-eif, and hehopedthe
tune was not far distant when they n lght hearthe pleasing in-
telligence that th^t «inglestar, the emblem of libeity, is flying m
tnutnphover Mexico.
The gentleman from Vermont had now taken his seat He
had observed that that gentleman was a man who was not often
excited, but when bent on thisobject of mischief, when engaged
on this sit hjectjWhichappearei1 uppermost in his feelings, would
indulge in intemperance and Molence towards that portion of
the country, which he appeared to ha e with a holy hatred.
What might have been the re'auonship of thit gentleman with
the present Minister to Mexic > he did not know The gentle-
men had ta^en occasion m his absence to say that, from hi*
want of temper, 1 e was unfit to represent us at Mexico If the
gentleman had jeeewed from this officer a piivate injury, it
wou! 1 have been much moie becoming in him to have repelled
tí e intuit at the time than at this distant period
Mr SLADE was understood to say he had no recollection of
having received insult or assaults of a peisonal character on
this floor fiom the gentleman from South Carolina the present
Minister
Mr BUTLER said he regretted that the gentleman frm Ver-
mont had been fit thus wantonly to assaj this gentleman in his
ab^ensc
Mi C T INGERSOLL moved to amend the amendmentby
reducing thesums of appropuation for the missions to Austria
and Prussia one half,
Mr \VlSErnsed thep mt whether this amendment to amo*
tion tostrike out an appiopnation wps in orr'er
The CHAIRMAN dedirled the amendment m order
Mr INGERSOLL said he had made the motion for the pur-
pose, he acknowledged, of saying something on this subject He
wai decidedly opposed to the amendment of the ger tleman
from NewYoilt,[Mr LiNN,]andhe sawbutvery little hope of
its success
He begged leave to premise what he conceived he had a right
tosay They were here in Committee of the Whole on the
money bill According to his impress1 one, all that was said hy
the gentleman /rom Vermont [Mr Slade! was not only stnetly
in order, but the sentiments he had uttered appeared perfectly
proper He had heard from that gentle man no attack Allthat
was yesterday said on the amendment by the gentleman from
New Y>rk fftlr Linn ] from Virginia [Mr Wi^eI and from
Illinois, [Mr Reyi^olds,] was m order They were here in
Committee of the Whole When an honorable gentleman, who
held so conspicuous a position as the chairman of the Commit-
tee of Ways and Means, húmeda bill of this sort through,
when every body knew, as (he gentleman fiom New Jersey
[Mi Haist-ed] had proved bv retnrds published a fewday«
ago m thelnte'ligencer, thattbisHouse wasalready in advanra
in its business of former Congresses at this period of theses
sion—when the gentleman said he hoped there woulc* be but
lit11 debate, he (Mr I ) said, in the face of the country—and
tl at was the principal reason why he had risen—that it was
be'te tl a' the appropriations for the Army and Navy should
be delayed th'n there snonld beany tun'ession of what any
and every Representative rhosa to say in Committee of the
Whole on thestateofthe Union The Commi^ee ofthe Whole
waa the great defence of the American public, an infinitely
stronger defence than the whole Army and Navy Mr I further
íeferred to the wiuc range of discussion proper to be taken in
Committee of the Whole, and said thatan opportuni'y should
be given to e^ ery individual to express his local and particular
a* well as hi^national views, ind that the abridgment of this
liberty was the gre r ream) i why this House was daily sinking
in public estimation when the othei legislative bod>,withno
bettei sense of propriety and decorum, was rising every day m
ffoidwill He intended, in hie remarks, to observe the rules of
iuler and appealed to the chairman to restrain him if he
*aould transgress them
The House would recollect (he was understood to say) that at
the last session he had moved to reduce the dijlomaic es a-
bishnent conceiving as he did that we had teo much of it in
the different parts ofthe woild Our diplomatic agencies were
cumbiuus, weio overdone In the latter part of the letter ad-
drrwd to the chairman ofthe Committee on Foreign Affairs
[Mi Adams] the s-ecietarynf State had suggested whether ih«
business could not be bettei d( ne by a difieren t an angement,con-
sulships instead of missions He (Mi I ) conceived that a con-
sul would be sufficient at Vienna and Berlin, where we now
hid full minister", and at JNapIes and Sardinia, where we had
unrequited charges He conceived that the whole system
might be reduced to the Republican standard
There was a view of this subject which was never taken;
that was, that precisely as we export foreign ministers do wa
import them It was the imported foreign ministers, «* whom.
we paid nothing, by whom we suffered vastly more than by
those we export, whom we pay Our foreign ministers cost ue
but little more than 680 000, but what did the foreign ministers
cost us here?   They had revolutionisedr this country    Thg
