Joseph E. Johnston, and participated in the capitulation between General Johnston and Major General W. T. Sherman, commanding U. S. Army of North Carolina. The condition of said capitulation on the part of General Johnston was that the army of his command should cease all acts of war from the date of the capitulation, 26th April aforesaid. In consideration of which condition thus entered into by General Johnston, General Sherman stipulated that the officers and men, composing the army of General Johnston should return to their homes, and there remain unmolested by the U. S. authorities so long as they observed the obligation they had entered into and obeyed the laws in force where they resided. I have this day been arrested by the order of the Secretary of the Navy, had a guard placed over my house, and have been informed that I am to proceed to Washington in custody, there to answer to a charge preferred against me predicated upon facts which took place anterior to the capitulation between General Johnston General Sherman. This being in violation of the capitulation on the part of General Sherman, I respectfully make this my protest against said arrest.
