Dispatch received from General [John] McNeil, dated 12 noon. Two gunboats had just arrived. Our troops in good spirits. General [William] Vandever left Fredericktown this morning with strong cavalry force to attack rebels in rear. Fifty miles to go, but will travel day and night. The firing heard at telegraph station, Jonesborough, has just ceased.

General McNeil telegraphs, 2 p. m., force Cape Girardeau that the enemy had ceased firing and seem to be changing position to renew the attack. Some of my re-enforcement had arrived safely by steamer. There has been no further firing hear at railroad station. Every moment admits of Vandever's nearer approach in the enemy's rear. Our troops are behaving well.

The enemy may take advantage of the darkness to retreat before Vandever's cavalry arrives. So far we claim a decided victory.
