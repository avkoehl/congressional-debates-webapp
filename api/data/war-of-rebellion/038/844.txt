be fully carried out, viz: The artillery in the center; First Brigade, Colonel [R.] McCulloch, on the right, in the following order: SECOND Missouri next the battery, Seventh Tennessee next on the right, both dismounted, long range, interspersed with shot-guns, advanced as skirmishers a little beyond the line of the artillery. Remaining regiments 300 yards in rear of the skirmishers, the horses in rear of this line. Major [A. H.] Chalmers' battalion, mounted and held, en echelon, on the extreme right flank. SECOND Brigade on the left in similar order, SECOND Arkansas being next the battery, Lieutenant-Colonel [A. C.] Edmondson next on the left, dismounted, and Major [J. M.] Park, mounted, en echelon, on the left flank, as will be more fully seen from a plan herewith furnished. The fire will be reserved, and the skirmishers fire their shot-guns first, in order to deceive the enemy. The mounted commands will hold themselves to protect the flank, and, in case an opportunity presents itself, they will turn the enemy's flank. In case of a retreat upon the part of the enemy, they will vigorously pursue. It is made the special duty of the SECOND Missouri and SECOND Arkansas to protect the battery, and in giving it to their charge, the commanding general is fully assured of its security.

By command of Brigadier-General Chalmers:

TULLAHOMA, May 8, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Your letter of April 29 received. I never thought of expressing censure of you in any dispatches.

Can you communicate with Lieutenant-General Smith? Now is his time to co-operate.

J. E. Johnston.

TULLAHOMA, May 8, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Your dispatch in cipher received. Cannot decipher about Port Hudson. Make entirely new cipher of that part. Disposition of troops, as far as understood, judicious; can be readily concentrated against Grant's army.

J. E. Johnston.
