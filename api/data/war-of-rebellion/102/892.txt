Major-General POPE, Saint Louis, Mo.:

I have ordered to Arkansas 5,000 infantry and to saint Louis a brigade of infantry and a brigade of cavalry to enable You to carry out orders for mustering out troops. If the troops raised from the rebel prisoners answer the purpose they may be retained. New Mexico will be added to Your command, and I expect some additional forces will be necessary there.
