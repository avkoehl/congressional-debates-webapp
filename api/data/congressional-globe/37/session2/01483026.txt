THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 30,
Mr. ARNOLD. Yes, sir, by looks and dams;
so that the steamers of the Mississippi may sail
within thirty-six miles of Chicago, where tliey
will enter this canal and proceed to the lakes.
Mr. WICKLfPPE. Wlmt portion of the year
is that river frozen up?
Mr. ARNOLD. Not exceeding three or four
months.
Mr. WICICLIFFE. What proportion of the
year is it dry?
Mr. ARNOLD. None at all. It has always
plenty of water.
Mr. WICKLIFFE. What is the depth of the
water ?
Mr. ARNOLD. I would answer with great
pleasure any inquiries in regard to this proposed
work. What information I have I will willingly
communicate to any gentleman; but I cannot per-
mit ray time to bo consumed by questions not
springing from a desirtf to obtain information, but
from a desire to impair tins measure.
Mr. F, A. CONICLING. If the gentleman will
permit me, 1 will avail myself of his offer a mo-
ment since to inquire the size of the present chan-
nel of the Illinois and Lake Michigan canal, its
depth ami width ?
Mr. ARNOLD. If the gentleman will look at
the report of the Committee on Military Affairs,
he will find an answer to his interrogatories. That
committee has made n full report upon this sub-
ject, and, without taking up the time of the House,
1 will refer the gentleman to that document for the
information lie desires. The Committee on Mili-
tary Affairs litis made a report upon that canal, in
which its importance, as a military measure, is
strikingly presented to the consideration of the
House. I will not consume the time of the House
by recapitulating the reasons why, «s a military
measure, tliey ask the Government to construct
this canal. The great lad is obvious to every in-
telligent mind that while our side of the frontier of
the lakes is utterly defenseless, with all its vast
commerce and agricultural products,Great Britain
has ihe means of throwing into the laltesa fleetof
gunboats, within the short period of ten days, to
desolate and lay waste that commerce, and to
bombard and destroy those cities and towns which
line their entire southern shore. And I want to
place upon record here to-day the statement,which
l firmly believe, that in the event of dillicultiea
with Great Britain, which is not so very improb-
able, in ten days she can destroy property enough
to build tliisnunal, and hundreds of millions more.
I ask gentlemen, in view of these facts, when
the State of Illinois comes forward and proposes
that all this work shall cost not exceeding ten mil-
lion dollars, and when she only asks your credit
to the amount that tile tolls received will pay the
interest upon, how it is that gentlemen who de-
sire that frontier protected and defended, can vote
against this proposition.
JIOIV CAN THIS IVIIKK BE ACCOMPLISHED, AND AT
WHAT COST?
There is a portage of about thirty-six miles from
Lake Michigan to that point on the head-waters
of die Illinois, where it can be made navigable;
by cutting through this portage and improving
the river you have a steamboat canal from the
lakes to the Mississippi. By these means, by this
canal, all that portion of the continent lying east
of the Mississippi and south of the great lakes
and river St. Lawrence becomes an island.
This work has been already more than half ac-
complished by the State of Illinois, aided by a
small land grant from Congress, made as early as
1027. Illinois has expended over six million dol-
lars on this work, which was completed in 1848.
It now yields un annual revenue of from two hun-
dred thousand to two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars. This would be very largely increased
by the improvement of the Illinois river. Illinois
lifters this canal and its revenue to the United
iitates on condition that Congress will provide the
menus of enlarging it so as to pass gunboats and
vessels of war from the lakes to the Mississippi
and the ocean, and fiom the Atlantic to the lakes.
This, as lias been clearly shown by the Military
Committee, is necessary as a military measure to
place us upon an equality with Gieat Britain. That
power lias already constructed canals which en-
able her to pass gunboats from the ocean and the
St. Lawrence to the lakes. We are to-day utterly
defenselessagainat iron-clad gunboats, which she
could bring from her navy-yards in England
through these canals; and thus the vast commerce
of the lakes, and the great agricultural products of
the West, and the wealth of the lake towns, would
be at the mercy of these gunboats. We are pro-
hibited by treaty from constructing- gunboats or
armed vessels on the lakes. Enlarge the Illinois
and Michigan canal as proposed, and the gun-
boats and mortar boats, which have contributed so
greatly to the success of our arms in the valley of
the Mississippi, could be transferred in case of
need at once to the lakes.
Had this canal been enlarged at the breaking
outof the rebellion, the naval resources and power
of the country would have been far greater than
it was. The twelve hundred steamers, tugs, and
vessels, and fifteen thousand sailors now locked
up on the great lakes, would have been at the dis-
posal of tile Government. With the mechanical
and manufacturing facilities of the lake cities, with
the ship timber, iron, and other materials on the
lakes, gunboats would have been made ready
months earlier than they were, and long ere this
the same skill and valor which have won the great
victories at Fort Donelson, Island No. 10, and
Pea Ridge, would have carried our flag in triumph
over New Orleans. The valley of the Mississippi
would have been long since entirely reclaimed and
the rebellion suppressed.
The Committee on Roads and Canals state that
from a careful consideration they are clear m their
judgment that had this ship and steamboat canal
been in existence during the past year, it would
have saved to the Treasury, in the transportation
of troops, arms, ordnance, and munitions, and m
cheapening and facilitating the building of gun-
boats, and in enabling the armies to have com-
menced operations in the field earlier, more than
one hundred million dollars. The value of this
woi k, in a military and commercial point of view,
can scarcely be exaggerated; and its value will be
constantly increasing with the progress of our
country in population,agriculture, commerce,and
manufactures.
The committee add that this work may now be
properly characterized as a military,commercial,
and political necessity. It will benefit every sec-
tion. To New England it will lessen the price of
food; to New York and Pennsylvania it will give
increased trade and commcrce; and to the West
it will cheapen every article of domestic or foreign
manufacture. It will bind still closer the lakes
and I lie valley of the Mississippi, and make the
East and West one in destiny forever.
The only objection which has been suggested
to this woik is its supposed draft upon an already
overburdened Treasury. This objection the com-
mittee report they have carefully considered,and
believe that the interest on its cost wilt be promptly
paid by the tolls of the canal, and that such tolls
will provide a sinking fund which will, at an early
day, discharge the principal, and thus this great
national work, free always for the military pur-
poses of the Government, having paid for itself,
would become free to the vast and constantly in-
creasing commerce of the lakes and the Missis-
sippi. It would save to the Northwest, every
year, in lessening the cost of transportation of its
staples, more than its entire cost. It would, the
day it was completed, add to the taxable property
of the nation an amount the taxes upon which,
under the present tax law, would more than pay
the interest on its cost. These were some of the
reasons which secured for this bill the cordial,
approval of the Committee on Roads and Canals.
WE, AS A NATION, HAVE BEEN ASLEEP WHILE ENG-
LAND HAS BEEN WIDE AWAKE AND SAGACIOUS.
It will, perhaps, astonish some to be told that
Great Britain to-day has as perfect command of
the lakes as she has of the British channel. If
she ia mistress of the ocean, she is also emphat-
ically mistress of the lakes. She has secured by
her canals ready access to them, while we are
prohibited, by treaty, from building gunboats to
meet her.
The enlargement of the Illinois and Michigan
canal has, by the conduct of Great Britain, been
rendered a clear,absolute, military necessity. A
failure on our part to construct it would now be
sheer stupidity. England has,by hercanals,made
the lakes as free to lier navy as the ocean..
"•Her (lath is on tbij ocean wave,
Her home is on the deep
may, ere we are aware of it, be changed to—
"Her patli is on the ocean wave,
Her home is on the lakes."
She to-day regards her supremacy there as ab-
solute. So say her public men in Parliament.
So say her press.
We are forewarned; let us be forearmed. I
appeal to New York to secure, by this canal, her
great cities of Rochester, Buffalo, and Dunkirk,
the termini of her vast railroads, and that im-
mense commerce which has placed the crown of
empire on her brow. Buffalo and Black Rock
were burned in 1812. Make this canal, and the
outrage will never be again repeated. I appeal to
Pennsylvania in behaif of Erie, and to Ohio in
behalf of Cleveland, Sandusky, and Toledo, and
her other lake towns.
JUSTICE TO THE NORTHWEST DEMANDS THE EN-
LARGEMENT OF THIS CANAL.
The northwestern States embrace one half the
loyal people of the Union. While Congress has
appropriated at this session nearly fifty millions
for forts, ships, &c., on the Atlantic, not one
million lias been given to the Northwest. Your
great naval depots, ship-yards, arsenals, armories,
at the East have received large appropriations.
There is no depot nor armory nor ship-yard nor
foundery on all the northern lakes. I beg the
attention of the House to the following table, pre-
pared by the Secretary of the Treasury in July
last:
Statement shouting the amount of money expended by the
Government of the United States from the adoption of the
Constitution to the 30th of June, 1860, in each State and
Territoiy of the Union, for navy yards, custom-houses,
court-houses, and other public buildings; for the improve-
ment of rivers and harbors, and for the construction of
forts, arsenals, and armories.

Jlpril 16, 1861.
Illinois, the fourth State in the Union, out of
$111,773,986, has received less than one million
dollars,
Florida, with a white population of less than that
of the congressional district 1 have the honor to
represent, lias received $10,372,185 63.
Louisiana, with a relatively small population,
has received $8,973,875 68.
I appeal to the justness and fairness of our
friends in the older States to help us. The West
has borne the brunt of this war, and received very
few of its immediate advantages growing out of
the expenditure of money. .Pennsylvania,-! think,
can afford to be liberal. We ask nothing for our
immediate local advantage, but when we ask aid
for a work so national, so necessary to national
