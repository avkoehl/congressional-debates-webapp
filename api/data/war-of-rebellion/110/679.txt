shall remain on Ross' left until I can see. Colonel Cole, in command of pickets at Lost Mountain Post-Office, reports the enemy advancing upon him. I have two regiments at that place. The enemy can only move around by the post-office or by the mountain, as the country opposite Ross' left and between his left and the mountain is impassable. A cavalry force of the enemy could get possession to the left of the mountain and the Marietta road before I can reach even my horses, were they to pass to my left. There is now no force on either side the mountain, except the picket at the post-office, composed of about 550 men.

Respectfully,

F. C. ARMSTRONG,

Brigadier-General.

Sharp skirmishing along the infantry line; also some firing upon Colvin's pickets.
