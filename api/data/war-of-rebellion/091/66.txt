Brigadier-General TORBERT,

Chief of Cavalry, Middle Military Division:

GENERAL: The enemy have made strong demonstration against the pickets at bridge on the road to Bunker Hill over the Opequon and at Sulphur Springs Ford. I had pickets on the opposite side covering those fords, but they have been driven away. I shall soon ascertain what force has approached Martinsburg. Scouting parties have been sent over.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION, DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA,Near Burns' Ford, September 10, 1864 - 5 p. m.

Brigadier-General TORBERT,

Chief of Cavalry, Middle Military Division:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that my First Brigade, Colonel J. M. Schoonmaker commanding, was stationed this morning at Darkesville, with pickets extending from Dandridge's Ford to Mills' Gap, according to the directions of the major-general commanding. At daylight patrols were sent to the front, which discovered the enemy's pickets at Bunker Hill, but did not attack them. Shortly after 8 a. m. three brigades of the enemy's cavalry - McCausland's, Johnson's, and Vaughn's - attacked, with one brigade of infantry of Rodes' division, the two regiments at Darkesville (the other regiments being on picket), and after a very severe contest compelled Colonel Schoonemaker to retire. Schoonmaker's brigade charged the enemy's cavalry three successive times under the direct fire of his artillery, driving them pell-mell through their infantry lines. The action was witnessed by several reliable officers of my command who have spent considerable time under fire during the past three months, and they all pronounce the action most gallant on the part of my cavalry. When their ammunition was nearly exhausted they retired in good order before the enemy's advance to Martinsburg, and have taken up the line as directed in the orders of the major-general commanding, which you communicated to me the other day. I have no report of casualties yet. A Union man, Van meter, living near Darkesville, states to one of my patrols that the enemy's infantry, Rodes' division, came as far as Darkesville and is there now. A prisoner from the Third Alabama Sharpshooters states that Rodes' division and a division of cavalry came to the point where he was captured (near Darkesville); that the cavalry went on to Martinsburg. While the action was going on the enemy made strong demonstrations of crossing at Sulphur Springs Ford and the wooden bridge, driving some squadrons which I had on the opposite side over to this. The last report from Martinsburg states the enemy did not attempt an attack upon Colonel Schoonmaker's last position, but retired.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. W. AVARELL,

Brigadier-General.
