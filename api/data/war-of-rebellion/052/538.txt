Colonel C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Chattanooga:

COLONEL: I left Ringgold at 1 p. m. to-day, under orders from Major-General Reynolds, to report to him with my regiment at La Fayette, Ga. Colonel Wilder sent two mountain howitzers with me. Is General Reynolds there? and what route shall I proceed on?

I beg to state that, being in advance of Colonel Wilder's brigade this morning, I had sharp skirmishing with one of Forrest's brigades at Ringgold; lost 6 horses, and 2 men severely wounded and others slightly. While engaging the enemy General Van Cleve's force, coming into Ringgold at right angles with us, began shelling him and he retreated through the pass east of Ringgold. He is reported to have three brigades. General Van Cleve and Colonel Wilder followed him,, and I heard some cannonading that way a little afternoon. We killed 11 of the enemy.

I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

SMITH D. ATKINS,

Colonel Ninety-second Illinois Volunteers, Wilder's Brigade.
