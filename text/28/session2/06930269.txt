APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOfiB,
269
28th Cong 2d Sess.
River and Harbor Bill—Mr. R. Smith.
H. of Reps.
  o Sir, while this government
holds vast quantities of land in the States through
which this road passes, ami to which it leads, it is
the true policy (to say nothing of the justice of the
measure) to make liberal appropriations for com-
pleting the road, to enable purchasers to get to those
lands. By the terms of admission of the States of
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri into the
Union, it was stipulated that 2 per cent, of the pro-
ceeds of the sales of the public lands in those
States should be applied to constructing roads to
and through those States; and this stipulation was
made on condition that the States should not tax
the lands lying within their borders, belonging to the
government, nor until five years after the sale of
said lands by the government. Ir, is not my intention
at this time to discuss either the justice or policy of
this compact as regards the above named States; but,
sir, permit me to say that, in my opinion, it is unjust
to those States, and at war with the spirit and letterof
the constitution of the United States, and of the acts of
admission of those States into the Union. The act
admitting the State of Illinois into the Union de-
clares: "And the said State, when formed, shall be
admitted into the Union on an equal footing with
the original States m ail respects whatever." I ask
you, Mr. Chairman, are we upon anjja ual footing
with the original States in all respects? Do we, like
the original States, exercisc equal privileges, rights,
and jurisdiction over all the lands within our bor-
ders? Do we, like those States, levy and collect
taxes upon all the lands lyimj within the limits of
our State? No, sir, no. While Illinois, at the time
of her admission into the Union, contained about
thirty-five millions of acres of land, she was pro-
hibited from taxing more than about two millions of
acres. Was this pursuing a liberal and generous
policy towards Illinois ? Was the application of two
per cent, of the proceeds of the sales of the public
lands to the making of roads, with the three per cent,
appropriated for the use of colleges and seminaries,
a fair and just equivalent for surrendering the right to
tax and draw revenue from 33,000,000 acres of
land, the minimum price of which was then two
dollars per acrc ? Sir, I think the parent, took an
undue advantage of the child in this trade or com-
pact. Let iu. look, for a moment, and see the amount
the State would receivc annually by taxing these
33,000,000 acres of land, at the value fixed by the
government, and at the rate of seventy cents on each
£100 of taxable property, being the amount paid
in many of the counties in Illinois, hy residents, for
State and county purposes. Sir, it would amount to
the enormous sum of §462,000 p^r annum. And
if valued as lands now are in Illinois, by our levenue
laws, would amount to 5093,000. And what have
we received for this surrender of our just and equi-
table right to this vast annual income? Why, sir,
pei mission to go into this wild unsettled country, and
encounter the tomahau'k and scalphig-knife of the In-
dian, with all the other hardships incident to the set-
tlement of a new country, and purchase land, first at
two dollars per acre, and now at one dollar and
t\venty-n\r cents per acie!'
Illinois, at the time of admission into the Union,
had a population of little more than 40.000 souls;
and this population scattered over that vast territory,
with little means of revenue, were left to mnke their
own roads, improve the country, drive out the
Indians, and make valuable the millions of acres of
land held hy the government. And, sir, oughtthey to
receive no consideration from the government for all
these services* The spirit and genius of our govern-
ment, are m accordance with the principles of equal-
ity, equity and justice. Now, sir, I would ask gentle-
men to show me the equity or justice of requiring
the laboring man to pay a tax for the few acres of
land he may own, (and from which, uby the sweat
of the brow,'' he earns his daily bread,) to build
roads and make improvements, and thereby add to
the value of all the lands in the country, whilst,
at the same time, the holder of millions of acres pays
nothing? is this doing justice to the working-men?
No, sir; no.
Gentlemen say we must rely upon the two per
cent, fund alone for completing this road, and charge
all the expenditures made in Maryland, Pennsylva-
nia, and Virginia, to that fund. Sir, I would ask
them to look at this picture. The rich ard power-
ful States of Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylva-
nia—rich in the ownership of all the lands within
their borders, possessing great mineral wealth, ex-
tensive improvements—rich in commerce and manu-
factures, with a dense population, and vast resources
of every description, and some of these States drain-
ing from the West exorbitant sums in the way of
piotective duties levied by the unequal and unjust
tariff of 1842 : not content with this, they want
to draw from our two per cent, road fund to make
roads for them. Yes, sir, to charge near three mil-
lions of dollars, expended in making roads in those
rich and powerful States, to the account of the two
per cent, arising from the sales of the public lands
in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri! The
;pitifiil, beggarly amount set apart by the government
to build roads in these then new and sparsely set-
tled State?, denied as they were the right of taxing
the unsold lai,ds, or even those sold until, five years
thereafter,—to attempt to rob us of this would be
an act fit only for the dark ages of the Old World. Is
there a member on this floor who will sanction such
an acr of flagrant injustice to these new States ? I
trust not. I sincerely hope that this Congress will
not tolerate any such species of robbery. Sir, it
would be of a piece with robbing the widows and
orphans to add to the luxuries of the rich.
If the government will expend, for the construc-
tion of roads in each of the States of Indiana and
Illinois, a sum in proportion to the amount cf mon-
ey paid into the treasury for lands in those States,
as compared with the amount received from the
State of Ohio—assuming, as it is right to do, that
all the money expended m the States of Maryland,
Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Ohio, was expended on
account of the compact made with Ohio upon her
admission into the Union, we will ask no more
—I ask gentlemen what direct advantage to Illinois
will be the money expended in those States, for
making this road, if it is not to extend to and
through that State? In answer to inquiries made of
the Engineer Department, I find there has been ex-
pended, on account of the Cumberland road in the
States of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia,
62,812,034 21. In ihe State of Ohio, ^2,077,631 06.
In the State of Indiana, $1,128,289 50. And in Il-
linois, $742,445 30. There has been sold, of public
lands, up to the 30th September, 1843, in the State
of Ohio, 14,257,340 83 acres; in the State of Indi-
ana, 14,254,826 97 acres; and in Illinois, 12,-
771,058 52 acres. And, sir, for these lands,
sold in Illinois, we have paid into your treas-
ury §16,027,394 84—six millions more money
than this government were willing to pay Tex-
as for 136,111,327 acres of her unsold lands.
The two per cent, fund arising from the sales of the
public lands in the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
and Missouri, amounted, on the 31st of December,
1843, to only ^1,133,521 56—not half the amount
expended on ths*. road m the States of Maryland,
Pennsylvania, and Virginia. More money has been
expended in the last named States thon the two per
cent, fund will amount to, when all the lands in the
first named States shad have been sold. And is not
this enough to satisfy gentlemen that Congress never
intended fhat this road should depend upon this fund
alone for its construction? If no more appropria-
tions are to be made for completing this road; it
would have been far better for Illinois if the govern-
ment had never expended a dollar in our State.
JiInch of the money expended by the government on
this road has been ivorse than thrown away; and as
the road was under the superintendence of the gov-
ernment, they cannot charge such sums to the ac-
count of the road. Again: the money expended
should have been so laid out as to do equal and even-
handed justice to every portion of the States through
which the road was designed to pass., This has not
been done.
Some gentlemen ask where will you get the
money to continue this road? I will answer him;
give us a portion of the money received for the sales
of the lancls we have given volue to by our labor and
toil, and but for which labor and the improvements
we hove made, never would have had any value.
Give us a portion of the refuse lands which have
been long in market and of little value to the gov-
ernment. Give us, sir, an equivalent for the addi-
tional value we have given your lands by our
"blood and treasure," and we ask no more! * This
road, so far as Illinois is concerned, has not been a
diain upon the treasury, but has been the means of
adding millions to it.
I consider this government bound by compact,
imolied, if not expressed, to complete this road.
Equity and justicc call for its completion, and the
honor and faith of the nation demand speedy and
efficient action in this matter. At the time this road
was projected, the government owned more that 100,-
000,000 acres of land in the States of Ohio, Indiana,
Illinois, and Missouri. What were those lands then
worth? How many of your citizens would have
encountered the perils and hardships of settling this
new country for the gift of sections of land? Feio
sir, very few. What think you these lands would
have then brought had they been sold in the mar-
ket? Why, sir, a mere song; nothing like as much
as you have already received from the sales of a
portion of them. I find by the report of the Com-
missioner of the General Land Office, that there was
received for lands sold in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and
Missouri,uptothe30th ofSeptember, 1843, $69,507,-*
167 39. A large proportion of this sum has been
paid into your treasury by persons who have pur-
chased and settled upon the wild and uncultivated
lands of the West, in consequence of the pledge made
that government would speedily complete this road;
and still, sir, if this government will pay a tax on
the hnds she now holds in Illinois proportionate to
that oaid by our citizens, and appropriate the amount
towards the completion of this road, I will venture
the assertion that my constituents will ask of you
no further aid. Justice is all we demand ; and not
only justice to the settlers of the West, who have
peopled and cultivated your wild public domain,
but justice to the government itself, who is still a
large landholder in my own State, and whose inter-
est as much demands the accomplishmentof this great
improvement as do the individual interests of the
men who till the soil. They arc one and identical.
You complete this road, and thousands of acres of
j'nur land, now comparatively of no value, will be
sold at once, and the proceeds put into your trea-
sury. Is this important consideration to have no
weight with those who profess to be so scrupu-
lously exact in guarding and fostering the true inter-
ests of the^eneral government. But I will pursue this
no further; but will add, after a careful examination
of the facts which I have had the honor of submitting
to the committee, showing the light in which Mr. Jef-
feison, Mr. Madison, Gen. Jackson, and other dis-
tinguished statesmen, have viewed this greatnatlonal
work, I hope gentlemen will not attempt to shield
themselves in their opposition to this appropriation
behind the constitution. It is unjust to the memory
of the great and good men who gave this work their
support year after year. It is a direct censure upon
the judgment and wisdom of the sage and hero of
the Hermitage; it is unjust to the pioneer settlers
of the West. And, sir, if this House do refuse
further appropriations for completing this road, it
will be a foul stain upon the nation's honor.
Subjoined is a table, exhibiting the amounts ap-
propriated and expended upon the construction of
the Cumberland road from 1806 to 1834, inclusive.
