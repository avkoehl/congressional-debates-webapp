THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 23,
saber in hand may overthrow a degraded Con-
This system of cumulative voting will relieve
the minds of many, in view not only of the
events of the past two yearsjn this land, where
the creators of a particular character of con-
stituencies have seen the monster Frankcn-
steins they created conquer themselves ; where
the very men who are now demanding this
increased number of Representatives now find
that on the questions of tariff and of currency
the West is overridden by the bogus Repre-
sentatives of unconstitutional constituencies.
For it cannot yet be forgotten that within two
days this Congress, which created a certain
description of constituencies in the southern
States, has felt itself compelled by a sense of
honor and of dignity to override technical
laws and to refuse to receive a worthy Repre-
sentative of a fitting constituency.
I repeat that should the amendment of the
gentleman from Illinois, [Mr. Marshall,] pro-
viding for the free vote, be adopted, many of
my objections to this increase of Representa-
tives in this House to three hundred would be
obviated, and I would not then bo compelled to
plead for delay, so that the great Northwest
may send men here who do not agree with New
England and with the chief portion of the Rep-
resentatives from the southern States at this
time. , .
I have another objection, which would be
obviated to a great extent by the adoption of
the amendment of the gentleman from Illinois,
[Mr. Marshall.] It'is that the next census
will be taken under an imperfect law, which
will east additional doubt upon the represent-
ative character of this body. Nearly every
State has disqualifying laws on accountoi ques-
tions of residence; eight States for non-pay-
ment of taxes. Many of the States disqualify
from voting on account of poverty, idiocy, ot
insanity; two States on account of want ot
literary qualifications. Seven States exclude
all persons under guardianship; two States on
account of want of character or bad behavior.
Paupers are not allowed to vote in eight btates ;
and so on, various causes prevail 111 every one
of the different States, which must work a dim-
inution of the representative basis as provided
by the fourteenth constitutional 'amendment.
Now, the array of assistant marshals will determ-
ine to a great extent who shall and who shall
not be counted as included in the basis of rep-
resentation. Partisanship will often decide.
State vanity or local interests will often govern.
The loose machinery by which the enumeration
will be taken would cast a doubt upon and taint
the whole succeeding Congress. But the taint
and suspicion will be largely increased by the
fact that the returns thus taken_ are not to be
submitted to Congress for revision, but una !y
determined and passed up (Hi by executive odi-
cers of your Government.
Mr. Speaker, an apportionment thus arbi-
trarily made by a Secretary of the Interior
upon a census of the people thus loosely and
often corruptly taken might shake the very
foundation of the representative system of this
country. When I plead for the adoption of
this amendment, with its principle of the free
vote, I plead for the introduction of some one
safeguard and principle which may g.ve an
additional representative character to a repre-
sentative body which does not maintain before
the world the same high position it formerly
held. But should this amendment be voted
down, I must uncompromising.y oppose the
measure It provides for a House ot Repre-
sentatives of three hundred members, instead
of one of' two hundred and forty-three, as at
present. This large increase 1 regard as un-
necessary and pernicious, ihe basis ot rep-
resentation was from—
 3,1,000
1790 to    40 000
1810 to    45 oco
1820 to    47,700
1830 to    70,680
1840 to   \::.;.1iJ3,UU0
1860 to   
Thus it'is shown that the uniform policy and
custom has been to increase the popular basis
of representation as the country has grown in
numbers. We have thus avoided turning this
House into a sort of mob, so inconveniently
large that individual representative responsi-
bility would be partially lost m the crowd.
Expenses, too, have been kept down, since each
Representative seems to carry in his train a
small army of doorkeepers, pasters, folders,
and clerks, as much impedimenta and as many
camp-followers as are found hanging on the
skirts of an oriental army ; and if you increase
the number of Representatives from two hun-
dred and forly-three to three hundred (fifty-
seven) you will add, not a few hundred thou-
sand dollars, but $1,000,000 to the expenditures
for the lower House of Congress. In addition,
a House of three hundred members will be so
inconveniently large that the public business
will be greatly retarded. But 1 will not multi-
ply reasons for opposing this large and unne-
cessary increase of this House. It is enough
to say that instead of increasing the basis of
representation with increasing population, as
has been the custom, it would remain the same
as now.
Let not the gentlemen from the W est^ sup-
pose that in opposing this increase I am influ-
enced by any hostility to that great and mag-
nanimous section. ^ In good time they will
receive that accession of strength which they
will doubtless wield so as to promote the glory,
honor, and perpetuity ol the Union, at thesame
time that they uphold true principles of taxa-
tion and tariff, of banking and of bonds. But
gentlemen from the West are much mistaken
if they suppose that their section is the only
portion of the country which would gam m the
next Congress, should it be possible to elect it
upon the basis of tha census now being taken _
I hold in my hand an estimate of all and each
of the States, carefully based upon the census
of 1800, the returns of the revenue olnciais tor
1807 and 1868 in reply to a circular ot the De-
partment, and upon a scientific calculation 01
the movement ot population, inducting natura...
increase, immigration, loss by war and emi-
gration from State to State?and all other causes.
Although it is only an estimate, it is carefully
prepared, and shows not only the probable
population in 1870, with the number of Repre-
sentatives which each State would be entitled
to should the whole number be increased to
three hundred, with a representative ratio 01
one hundred and thirty-three thousand, but
how many each State would be entitled to upon
a ratio of one hundred and fifty thousand,
and also with a ratio of one hundred and sixty-
three thousand five hundred. Before sending
the estimates to the Clerk's desk to be read
and appended to my remarks, I will only say
that Pennsylvania shows the largest absolute
increase in population of any State, namely,
one million people, would gain five members
of Congress, and consequently would obtain
as much additional relative influence on this
floor as any State except Illinois.

thousand, and one hundred and sixty-three thousand five hundred, to each Representative, is made upon
