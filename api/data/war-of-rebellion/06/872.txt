RICHMOND, VA., April 10, 1862.

Major General MANSFIELD LOVELL,

New Orleans, La.:

Are the cotton-lined boats ready, and where are they?

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.

RICHMOND, VA., April 10, 1862.

To the GOVERNORS OF MISSISSIPPI, LOUISIANA, SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND ALABAMA:

General Beauregard must have re-enforcements to meet the vast accumulation of the enemy before him. The necessity is imminent; the case of vital importance. Send forward to Corinth all the armed men you can furnish.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

NEW ORLEANS, LA., April 11, 1862.

JEFFERSON DAVIS:

Can troops be armed if I send them? I have no arms here except those General Lovell thinks we should keep-those just received from Pensacola.

THO. O. MOORE.

RICHMOND, VA., April 11, 1862.

Gov. THOMAS O. MOORE:

No arms to furnish. You will not fail to appreciate the necessity which caused the application to you. If you could spare armed troops for a few weeks they might then be returned to you.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

NEW ORLEANS, LA., April 11, 1862.

Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

Governor Milton will not forward my guns. John Leeds, my agent, has been waiting at Columbus, Ga., one week. Order them sent. I am greatly annoyed.

THO. O. MOORE,

Governor of Louisiana.

RICHMOND, VA., April 11, 1862.

General MANSFIELD LOVELL,

New Orleans, La.:

We have just had a call for arms from Corinth, which we cannot supply, but shope soon to be able to do so and to send you some. Did you receive my telegram yesterday asking where the cotton-lined boats are?

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.
