that they had tntered into contracts for opening
two roads,which would intersect the RestooL ?tvet

T   A MAGLAUCHLEN,
Warden of ike Disputed Territory
His Excellency Major General Sir A Campiiei l
This letter was communicated by Sir Arch
ibaid Campbell to the Batish Mimstei, and by
him to our Government Is there nothing heie
to show that the Governor of New Brunswick
consideied the understanding as extending over
the whole territory? Heie we have the title
** Waiden of the Disputed Territory," and his
claim of jurisdiction over the whole, with the
asseition that the land agents of Massachusetts
and Maine had counteiacted the wishes, nay, he
•¡nigh* almost say, the msh uclioas of holh Govern-
me tsto an ojjicer who teas appointed to pi event col-
lision between them But this is not all This
subject teceived the piompt attention of the Gov-
ernor of Massachusetts, who acknowledged the
tecupt November 1,1833, accompanied by a dis-
tinct piotest against this claimof exclusive juris-
diction
* I cannot but earnestly protest against the authority of
any appointment on the behalf of Ins Majesty's Govern
ment which maybe resided as a claim to the exclusive
protection of this property, or be deemed an acquiescence
< n the part of the tinned fctates in interference, under color
of a 'Wardenship of the Deputed Territory,' with that
direction toits improvement which the governments of Mas
«ncimsuis and Maine respectively may see fit to give their
agents "
Can it be pretended that this claim was not
then bt ought duectly tQ the notice of our Go\ em-
inent, and that it was asserted to be by an arrange-
ment between the twei nations* The Governor
of Massachusetts had no difficulty rn understand-
No. 18
Boundary Question—Mr. ¿Si
ing the extent of the claim, and his protest dis
tmctly informed the Secretary of State that he d d
so understand it
The land agent of Massachusetts was immedi-
ately called on for information by the Governoi,
who says
" X lme already written to Mr MoT me ptotestmg
against the right of his Majesty's provincial officers to m
ti riere with any directions which the government of the
Si ites of Mime ind Massachusetts rnay think proper to
give t) their aBents in the management oí their property m
the territory over which the British Government has recent
Iv extended her extraordinary and unfour ded claim, but at
the samt tune expressing i willingness to respect the
wishes of the General G wcrnment in afost lining jrom any
facts of exctusive occupancy during the pendency ol ineis
u es to bring the subject ol controversy to an amicable is
sue "
In that officer's reply to the Governor, Novem
bei 8, 1833, he states
" As to the charge of holding out inducements to the
subj cts of bofh countries to cut pine timber on the tern
toiv in dispute, so far a> concerns my agency, it is entirely
grotttidle s I hive received repeated ipp ic itions for per
nuts to cut timber, ind X have invinably in wered thit I
would not Grant my until the di p up should be setth d ind
it in> umber was cut I «houid order it seized Winter
beioie tin last, I caused some timber to be seized upon the
Ar  o to>k river, and I slioit tunc after, the same timber
was sei¿ed by the Xintish—I think by the sime person that
prefers this complaint or pur«umt to his orders The tim
ber wis iltuwaids sold, ind the imount, whatever it may
hive tiei n, went into tilt hands of the officers ot the colony
of NewXiiun wick Jt is ippirent, therefoie, that our m
terest is to prevent timber being cut, rather than to induce
the cuituif. "
Tint, lettei was transmitted to the Secretary of
State Not ember 15
Anothti complaint was made by the "warden"
to the Litutenint Goveniot November 22, 1833,
who transmitted it, through the British Mimstei,
to our Government The subject was the open-
ing of a road to the Aioostook nvei Sn A
Campbell writes
" \ our Excellency is- iware that the territory thus virtu
allvawaided though often cliuncdas Amentan, has never
celled to be undi r the re o°ni~cd juri diction of Great
X mam, md the provincial C>oi eminent would be scaicely
justified in continuing to look tlmelv on at this systematic
and unprovoked violation of our rights "
This was communicated by Mi Vaughan to
our Government
All this took place in 1833   Was not this claim
of exclusive jurisdiction biought to the notice of
our Government'   And did they instantly íepel
it'  Is there any evidence of this until long after
waidsJ
Are gentlemen ready to rush into war at once
on account of this claim, as a false and ground-
less pretense' In the present state of this ques
tion, with the obscuuty theie is abov.t it, instead
of doing or encouraging any act which may tend
to bung on war between these two gieat na
tions, with all Us tremendous evils, should we
not anxiously desire to give time foi explana-
tion '
The resolutions of the Legislature of Massachu
setts of March, 1836, forwarded to the ¡National
Lxecutive (Doc 199,1 wenty-rourth Congress,
first session) leave no doubt as to the understand
ing of that Legislature on this point They are
as follows
Whereas a lirge tract of the northeastern territory of the
United St ites, belonging in coinini n to the Si nes ol Maine
and Massachusetts ina Iving within the limits of the foimer
State, has for many years past, m consequence of a claim
of Great Britain been surrendered to the occlusive custody
of the British Givernment, and whereas it appears from
the repoit of a committee appointed by the list Legislature
of this Commonwealth, to make personal examination into
the state ot our public lands tint great mconvenn nces and
gross abuses have resulted fiom sovalu ibie a portion cf our
domain being lett in the keeping of agents over whom we
have no contiol   Therefoic,
Resohel lythe Senate and House of Rcpiesenlatues in
General Court assembled That in the opinion of thisLegis
lature, it is due to the rights and inteiests of Milne ind
Massachusetts that meisuies should be taken by the Exec
utivc of the United States to =ecurc i «peedy settlement of
this long protracted controversj, «o that these States may
be reinstated tn the enjoyment of that property which, v as so
long ¿n their undisputed possession, and which is so indisput-
ably theirs
" Resoli cd, That, in case there be a prospect of further
unavoidable delay in the settlement of this controversy, it
is essential to the ends of justice that measures should be
taken by the Executive of the United States to obtain a
representation ol the interests ind rightsoi Mameand Was
sachusetts in the agency and guaidiauslup of the tcmtoiy
in question "
Ho. of Reps.
Comment on these resolves is unnecessary
They have been ably consideied by the gentle-
man from Pennsylvania, [Mi Biddi E ] This
claim, and the surrender of the disputed territory
to the exclusive custody of the British Govern-
ment, is the very grievance complained of That
is the ground of the resolutions It is stated to
be the very object for which the speedy settle
ment of the " protracted contioversy is demand-
ed," "so that these States may be mtiít«fcd m
the enjoyment of that property which was so long
in then undisputed possession " And it was le-
solved that tt was casential " to oblam alepiesent-
alion, &,c , in the agency and guardianship of the
territory tn question To what does that refer  
Clearly to the whole " disputed temtoiy "*
Mi S then referred to the message of Governor
Kent, in January last, and to a letter of ins to the
President of the United States, in April, 1838, in
which he says-
u Maine feels that the time for decisive action has come 9
that she cannot be satisfied to 1 ive the clum to ibsolute
and exclu ive jurisdiction ot a large part of her territory
longer tolerated and acquiesced z?i "
He also referred to the protest of the " war-
den, "after notice was given tint t! e commission
ers were going on to explote, de , agitnst(íany
act implying sovereignty or junsdiotion on the
part of any Government or State, or of the citi-
zens oi subjects of any Government or State, ex-
eicised within the terntoi vin dispute, and ¡mown
by the name of the ditptded territory, until the right
to that territory shall have been decided by nego-
tiation between the two Governments "
Do not these documents show that five or six
years ago, at least, the Government of New Bi una
wick claimed the absolute and exclusive juusdic-
tion of the whole tenitory,and that i" warden"
was appointed under the authority of the Biitish
Government, with supervisory power ovei the
whole—not the Madawtskt settlement merely,
but the vahóle— and that this was made known to
our Government'
Let me not be misunderstood My object is
not to bung reproach on a past Administration,
or any of its officers No, let this dclontc be fiee
from all party taint, but a subject of this vast
importance ought to be fully examined and con-
sidered
At the time of the late movement there had
been no recent change of circumstances Nothing
had been done by the United States or by Gieat
Butain since the close of the last session of Con-
gress The late movement on the part of Maine
has produced the piesent cusís It is deeply to
be legretted, and 1 must fcailessly say that, in
my judgment, it was indiscreet—unfortunate, to
say the least of it Might not the consequences
have been foreseen ' Would not a different course
have effected the object, without risking such con-
sequences'
Sir John Harvey has the reputation of being
an honorable, as well as a gallant officer might
there not safely have been a communication with
him, or with oui Government, as to the tiespass-
es' Both paities are to be consideied as jointly-
interested in the temtory indispute Thecourse
taken pioceeded, I have no doubt, from a deep
sense of injury Their interests had been neg-
lected , they have made complaints,and have given
intimations of the course they should feel com-
pelled to putsue It is still possible, I trust, that
the course taken will not lead to the consequences
-ome apprehend, it may lead to a settlement of
the boundary question Should that be the case,
it will be foi túnate
The first step was a secret session of the Le-
srislatuie, and the passage of the resolve which
led to the expedition Any one knowing the
state of feelmg on this subject, on both sides of
the line, might well appiehend what would follow
The people of Mame have great spirit and cour-
age, they will do what they say—I know them
well, therefore, I look at the present state of
things with the greatest concern There was a
secret session—then a posse Who ever heard of
such a posse before' It had the appearance of a
military expedition They still remain at the
Aioostook, where they are intrenching them-
I selves—for what' To'disperse trespassers '
I     This course may embarrass the boundary ques-
