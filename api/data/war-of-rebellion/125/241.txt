every sixty days by substituting a regiment for the one relieved, at expense of transportation by the State. Will this constitute a safe and sufficient guard, and is the process of alternating regiments satisfactory to you, so as to relieve the veteran regiments now at Johnson's Island?

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, April 21, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I much prefer the veteran regiments, but believe that I can hold the prisoners at Jonson's Island safely with this volunteer militia.

Major-General.

GENERAL ORDERS, WAR DEPT., ADJT. GENERAL'S OFFICE, Numbers 174. Washington, April 22, 1864.

EMPLOYMENT OF CAVALRY ORGANIZATIONS NOT MOUNTED.

Cavalry organizations which cannot immediately be supplied horses will be armed and employed temporarily as infantry. They may be used to guard depots and railroads or be assigned to infantry brigades in the field. When regiments so assigned are partially mounted the horses will be transferred to others.

Commanders of departments and separate armies are authorized to dismount and employ as infantry any cavalry regiment which was been neglectful or wasteful of its horses, or has proved inefficient in the field, and transfer its horses to others.

The proportion of cavalry to be temporarily converted into infantry will not exceed 40 per sent. of any command, unless it be found that the remaining 60 per cent. cannot be kept efficiently mounted.

By order of the Secretary of War:

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

GENERAL ORDERS, WAR DEPT., ADJT. GENERAL'S OFFICE, Numbers 175. Washington, April 22, 1864.

LIABILITY OF TEAMSTERS, &amp;C., TO TRIAL FOR DISOBEDIENCE OF ORDERS.

By order of the Secretary of War:

E. D. TOWNSEND,
