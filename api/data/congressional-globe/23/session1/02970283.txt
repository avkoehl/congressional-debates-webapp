examine the paper, men ed to lay the motion on the
table for the pitsent, which wasagi e 1 to
Ihe VICE PREsiDDN V presented a commu-
nication from the Governor ot M migan, rek ivt
to the southern houndary of stud teiritory, which,
on motion of Mi NAUDAIN, was reitired to tile
Committee on the fad ciaiy.
Mr f IPrON p'-ebe^ted a rnimo ¡al from -'tin-
dry citizens of Arkansas Teiritoiy, winch was
referred to the select committee on (he admission
of Michigan and Aikansas into tht Union
On motion of Mi FRELliNGHUYcsLN, the
Senate took up the bill making appiopiiation for
repair and completion of the Cumberland Rt \d
through the States of Onio, Indum, and ldi 101
Mi HEÍNDIÜCKS moved an amendment to
apply a portion of the appropriation to buildi )g
toll gates aniPtol1 houses on the load
Mr POlNDLXrCRoppobedtheapphcationof
the money to any purpose but the re¡ au of the
road
Mr HENDRICKS said he opposed the amend
ment, because the act of the L°gishtme of Penn-
sylvania  contemplated  the taki ig  of the  ¡oad,
when tne toll gates and houses were put up
Mr CLAYTON opposed the whole bi 1 on
principle The improvement system was design-
ed as a national system, and this proposed cession
to the States thiougn winch the road passed,
would be destructive of this gieat pr ncple, if
the Statts weie to e\eioise unlimited jurisdiction
over it
Mi E WING replied, that it wojld not be giving
the exclusive jurisdiction over the road to the totate
Congress still re amed its' pov ei o\er t Tiie
States were the agents of the General Gn e-nment
They weie to take only enough tolls' í< i repining
the load It must go out of lepan, oi the Sta'es
must tike it under then contiol
Mi FREL1NGHUYSIN thought his was o íe
of the most substant al improvemei ts of the Get
eral Government L was a higl ly natiom1 ob
ject, and to stop it now, would be srjnuing tne
luí eral knell of the sysirm, and, therefoie, he was
not in favoi of it He had reason to believe, from
the reports on the subject, that by a furthei ex
penditure of §(.00,000 oi <wO0,C0O,it could be put
incomplete older, and then the btates would take
it under their control
Aftersomefurtherremaiks.Mi HENDRICKS
withdrew his amendment                                            i
Mr PRESTON then made snne remarks m
opposit'on to the bi I, and then offeied the follow-
ing amendment to the appiopiiation
" Piovid'd, Trie States of Mai y a ><l and Pe> n-
syhania consent to ¡eceive those porlioi s ol the
' road pabsng through their rf pectne terntoties,
' upon the said sum of §1300,000 i uttmg the said
' road in leniu  "
Mr W1LK1NS opposed the amendment, be
cause it would tend to defeat the 1 11 lit did not
know how the consent of the Slates eoiAl be
obtained We must trust to their good faith to
take the road, and he doubtea not tney would do
so
After some further lemarks by Me&sis CIAY,
