tending the sale of the third bond, which was sold
to the bank
The first question which arises in this course
of inquiry is, was the state of the Treasury, at
the time the negotiation was concluded for an an-
ticipation of the payment of two thuds of this
bond, and a postponement for the period of fifteen
days only of the remaining third, such as to war-
rant the arrangement on the part of the Secretary
of the Treasuiy, as one calculated to promote the
public interests, and to secure more certainly the
payment of the public creditois? Tbis question
the Secretary of the Treasury himself shall an-
swer. And as the same question will necessarily
arise in reference to the sale of the third bond,
and as the report of the Secretary, in answer to
the call of the Senate, frequently speaks of the
condition and necessi ties of the Ti easury m refer-
ence to both of these negotiations m the same
sentence, his answer as to both shall be given
here I read first from page 4 of the report,
which relates more particularly to the payment of
the second bond, to fall due in September, 1838,
though clauses of the extract allude also to the
sale of the third bond     The Secretary says:
" To avoid the payment of the bond that was to fall due
on the 1st of October, being made in new treasury notes,
not reissuable, nor available m any way todischarge appro
priations, and which event was apprehended bvthe Depart
inent, the written agreement was made with the bank,
which will be found among the documents, stipulating,
among other things, for the payment of that bond on drafts
to the public creditors, and m specie or its equivalent
Tins, though collateral to the sale of the other bond, was a
part of the same negotiation.
" It wis very clear at the time, and has been confirmed
by subsequent events, that the p íyment by the bank of its
bond in such 1 rcasury notes, and a f lilure to make that
arrangement, the only pracuc ible one for the sale of the
third bond, would render either a special call of Congress
or a suspension of pavment of some ot the demands upon
the Treasury inevitable     I he Department did not feel it
self at liberty to hesitate in deciding between an expo ure
of the public service to citht r of those exticmities, by m
sistmg upon having the whole of these laigesumsof money
paid at one time, ind placed elsewhere m other suitable
depositories, if any could be found in the presentimperft ct
state of the law, or a consent to leave them m the hands of
the public debtoi until thej were actually wanted and then
to draw for them  in specie or its equivalent, when and
where the public service required    Especially could the
Department not hesitate, when this course was notmiuri
ous to that seivice, and it was unable at that tune 'u with
draw those funds except by the debtor's voluntary con
sent "
Again, on page 5, with more exclusive refer-
ence to the arrangements in relation to the second
bond, and to the places and manner of disbuise-
ment required by the wants of the public service,
he says
" In relation to another inquiry, concerning 'the period
when the sum ot ^?l,6ü0,O0O, in pait pajment of the second
bond of the Bank of the United btates wa« pi iced to the
credit of the i i easury, I state that $800 00  was placed to
his credit on the 15lh d íy of August, and ^800,000 more on
the loth September 1838 As to the'natur* of the v\hole
agreement on that subject, Í reply that it will be found m
the correspondence annexed
" The substance of it was that about one third of the
amount of the bond should be paid in the middle of August,
one third in the middle of September and the other third in
the middle of October, as these periods and amounts of
payment were deemed likely to promote the convenience
oí the treasury, it not of both parties, better than to pay
the whole large sum of near two and a half millions at once
at the clo^e of the month of September It was further
stipulated that interest should cease on each of the install
ments thus paid on the day they were placed to the credit
of the treasurer, and made subject to his diaft As the
money was wanted at different points to meet the public
expenditures near them, the draits of the Treasurer on tin
bank, payable at those several points, were engaged to be
met there with promptitude, and in specie or its equina
lent "
Heie is a condensed, but full and clear, state-
ment of the result of the negotiations as to the
mode and manner and times of payment of the
second bond, with suggestions as to the conveni-
ence to the Tieasury of this manner of payment,
ovei that of the receipt of the whole sum of about
two million four hundred thousand dollars, in a
single payment, on the 1st day of October, while
the extract closes with showing that the pay-
ments, at the times and places stipulated, were to
be made " in specie or its equivalent "
Again, upon pages 2 and 3 of the report,
and refeinng principally to the sale of the third
bond, the Secietaiy goes more fully into thestate
of the Treasuiy, and shows most cleaily the ne-
cessity for the sale and anticipation of the pro-
ceeds of this bond, which were not to become due
until Septembei, 1839, to meet the appropriations
of 1838, which, he says, " proved to be unusually
great " It need scarcely be said that, if such was
the condition of the Treasury,and the anticipated
wants of the public service, in July, as to piove
the necessity for the sale of the third bond before
the close of that fiscal year, the same facts must
have proved more clearly the necessity of an-
ticipating, so far as that could be done, the pay-
ments upon the second bond, the whole of which
was to fall due on the 1st day of October. The
language of the Secretary is
" The appropriations actually made h iving proved to be
unusually great, and the expenditures anticipated during
the two next ensuing months being much larger in amount
than the immediate means which the Department could
expect to derive in money from other sources within those
months, I at once addressed letters to the bankers Sf the
United btates at London, and to our Minister at Paris, re
questing that measures might be taken, without delay, to
obtain offers for those bonds, if possible, from capitalists m
Europe To thi se letters answers were received in due
season, stating that, from the short time the bonds had to
run, the absence of the guarantee of the United States for
their eventual payment, and other causes, no sale could
probably be effected ot them either m London or Pans
within the limits fixed bylaw In the mean time, however,
finding that the demands for the public service during the
month of June had exceeded four and a half millions, and
expecting, as thejact turned out to be, that they would equal
about seven millions in July and August, and finding, also,
that the available balance in the Treasury, applicable to gen
eral purposes, and subject to draft, fcllbelow §t,000 000, and
that payments were making at times in new treasury notes
which could not bo rendered at all available, I considered
it necessary to effect a sale of at least one of the bonds at
an earlier day than ndviees could be i eceived and anv pro
ceeds realized from Europe Particular mquirv was, there
fore, instituted in the city of New York, and elsewhere,
concerning the probability of selling soon one or more of
the bonds and also a public advertisement was issued, m
vitmü proposils generally for their purchase
" 1 he result was, that from the abundance of State stocks
m the market, at very reduced prices, the loner rate at
which other securities of the ban! were selling an 1 the want
ofaguaranteehythc (Tinted States the sale was found with
the exception hereafter stated, to be wholly impricticable
in this country, and was expected to be so abroad under
the conditions piescnbed m the act J idee Z, no bids vcrc
at any time made for either of the bonds m conformity to
those conditions extept that of Charles Maealester, Esq ,
of Philadel pina, who offered to pui chase both of them within
the teims of tlu law "
Here is the most full and clear answer to the
question The expendituies for June had been
moie than " four and a half millions," those foi
July and August were expected to be "about
seven millions " which expectation was realized
by the fact, and the "balance in the Treasury
applicable to general purposes, and subject to
draft, fell below one million " Hence, the Sec-
retary " considered it necessary to effect a sale of
at least one of the bonds at an eaiher day than
advices could be received, and any proceeds real
lzed fiom Europe "
I will now proceed to notice the correspond
ence, and first, that in relation to the payment of
the second bond. And here it will be interesting,
if not useful, to notice dates and coincidences
between the proceedings in Congress towards a
sale of the bonds, and the efforts on the part of
the bank to gam possession of them, or make ar-
rangement for their payment
On the 5th of April, 1838, the Senate by a res-
olution instructed the Committee on Finance to
inquire into the state of the Treasury, and in
case there should be a prospect that more means
would be wanted than had been provided by Con
gress, further to inquire into the expediency of
raising those means by a sale of the bank bonds
On the 21st of the same month, Mr Maealester
addressed to the Secretary of the Treasury anote
making distinct propositions for anticipating the
payment of the second bond, to fall due in Sep-
tember, 1838,and inviting a correspondence The
documents exhibiting this negotiation will be
found appended to the repoit of the Secretary of
the Treasury, now under consideration, com
mencing at page 11, and are marked A 1 to 7,
inclusive The negotiation was unsuccessful, be-
cause the parties could not agree as to the me-
dium in which the proposed payments should be
made, but theie are certain points in this corre
spondence which I consider it important to no-
tice, foi future reference, and will, therefore, read
to the Senate a few short extiaets The Secte-
tary, m his reply to Mr Macalester's first note,
undei date of 28th Apnl, writes as follows
' In the mean time as >ou do not state that the proposal
contained in vour letter is made under mthonty lioni tin
bank, and as the discussion of such a proposal, unless made
directly by the bank, or its authorized agent, might be liable
to misconstruction, and lead to no useful result, you will
see the necessity, before my replying fullv, that any ar-
rangement desired should be made in that form "
In reply to this pait of the Secretary's note,
Mr Maealester, undei date of the 2d of May,
says-
" Sir I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of
your letter ot 38th ultimo In answer to which, I have to
state that t am authorized by the Bank of the United States
chartered by Pennsylvania to enter into the arrangements
proposed in my letter of 21st ultimo "
This establishes the fact that Mr. Maealester
was here acting as the agent of the bank, with
full powei to make the arrangement he proposed,
and as lie continues, throughout all the negotia-
tions as to both bonds, to act as the principal
agent and instrument of the institution, without
anything further appearing upon the face of the
papers, as to his character or powers, the above
inquiiyand answer were, doubtless, considered
by both parties sufficient upon that point.
In the answer of the Secretary to Mr Macal-
ester's note of the 2d of May, from which the
above is extracted, and in which he makes formal
propositions as to the times, places, and manner
of payment of the second bond, is the following
paragraph, which closes the letter.
' To prevent misapprehension, «should be distinctly un-
derstood that, with the exception of Treasury notes, the
general course has been to accept no credit, unless the de
posit is made in specie or its equivalent, or, unless the de-
posit has been received by some public claimant as eqinva
lent to specie The right of every claimant to be paid ill
the legal currency of the United States is fully recognized
by this Department, and, considering the opinion enter-
tained by the Executive and at least one branch of the he
gislature the idea must be expressly excluded that the note 
of the second Bank of the United States, cliartered in 1816^
can be permitted to be employed in any of the transactions
growing out of this arrangement "
This letter bears date on the 3d of May, and,
under date of the 5th of May, Mr Maealester re-
plied, which terminated that negotiation. Among
other things, he says
' I did not and could not have intended to propose a ne-
gotiation on the basis of a specie payment "
These are the only references to this corre-
spondence necessary to my purpose, and they are
necessary because they establish the character of
Mr Maealester as agent of the bank, and the fur-
thei fact that the Secietary of the Treasury, in
the negotiation, adhered to " the basis of a specie
payment, or a payment equivalent to specie."
This conespondence covered the time fiomthe
21st April to the 5th of May We have before
seen that, on the 5th of Apnl, the Committee on
Finance was instructed to inquire as to the expe-
diency of a sale of the bonds, and the inquiry was
general, relating as well to the second as to the
third and fourth bonds, all of which remained un-
paid On the 2d of May, the committee reported
a bill rrovidmg for the sale of the third and fourth
bonds, but not affecting the second, and on the
5th of the same month, the negotiation as to an-
ticipating the payment of this latter bond was
terminated by the agent of the bank, unless some
other than a specie basis for the payment could
be acceded to On the 11th of May, the bill for
the sale of the third and fourth bonds passed the
Senate, and on the 7th of July after it became a
law
On the 23d of July, a second negotiation was
opened by Mr Maealester, by inviting the Sec-
retary of the Tieasuty to make specific proposi-
tions for the payment of the second bond in three
installments, to be paid on the 15th days of Au-
gust, Septembei,anil October,1838, the bond being
payable, by its terms, on the 1st day of October
of that year To this invitation the Secretary an-
sweied, under date of the 24th of July, consent
mg to the times of payment proposed, and naming
the places of payment, and the sums to be paid
at each place, and closing with the following lan-
guage
" In all cases however, it is of course understood that
payments will be made m specie or its equualent "
These terms Mr Maealester accepted by a note
dated 25th July, meiely requesting that the ne-
gotiation might be considered open m ¡elation to
the places of payment, and the sums to be paid
at each, so far as the convenience of the Treas-
uiy and the wants of the public service would
permit On the 27th the Secretary replied, con-
senting to malie such changes in the places of
payment, and the amounts at each, as could be
