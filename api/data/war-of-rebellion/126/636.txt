this call for 500,000 troops embraced all those arising from the tentative draft commenced in July, 1863, and all those under the call of October 17, 1863. This call of February 1 was in fact only for 200,000 men, less the number obtained directly by the draft.

To take advantage of the time during which Congress had provided that large bounties should be paid for volunteers, and to meet an anticipated reduction in the number of men to be obtained for the Army under the preceding call, on account of the law requiring that men going into the Navy should be credited, a call for 200,000 more men was made, as shown below, and the draft (fixed for the 10th of March) was postponed to allow volunteering under the new call.

The original act of March 3, 1863, was amended February 24, 1864. The first section of the amendment provided that the President of the United States should be authorized, whenever he should deem it necessary during the present war, to call such number of men for the military service of the United States as the public exigencies might required.

Under the provisions of this act the President, on the 14th of March, issued a proclamation a in which a call was made and a draft ordered for 200,000 men for the military service (Army, Navy, and Marine Corps) of the United States to supply the force required to be drafted for the Navy, and to provide an adequate reserve force for all contingencies. It designated the 15th of April, 1864, as the time up to which the quotas assigned to the different wards, towns, townships, &amp;c., might be filled by voluntary enlistments, and directed that a draft should be commenced as soon after that date as practicable in each ward of a city, town, &c., which had not then filled its quota. It directed that the Government bounties then paid should continue until April 1, 1864, and that on and after that date $100 bounty only should be paid as provided by the act approved July 22, 1861.

The draft commenced as reqd was completed without serious difficulty or opposition.

The results of these calls, viz, the draft of 1863 and the call of February 1, 1864, for 500,000 men, including the 300,000 called for October 17, 1863, and that of March 14, 1864, for 200,000 additional, are given in table herewith.b They may be recapitulated as follows:
