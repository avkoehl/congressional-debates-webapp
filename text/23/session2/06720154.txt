or relative to the survey, locanon, sale, and trans-

reseives, together with maps and plots of said
surveys, and of the tiacts approved and confirmed

and what remains unappropriated, that have been

with the evidence of title
Mr PLUMMER moved an amendment to the  '
resolution to íestnct the call for information to
I " that not already communicated to the Senate
'undei íesolutions of that body, adopted at the
' last session "
The question being on this amendment,
Mi PLUMMER said he had not yet had an
opportunity of investigating this subject so fully as
he ought to do to justify recoidmg his vote upon
its adoption He had, however, giv en it a pai tial
investigation yesterday, as much as the time wou'd
permit, and he had considerable doubts of the ex-
pediency or propnety of adopting it, in any form
or shape whatever At any rate, he certainly
thought that the amendment he had offered should
be appended to it, for this reason- at the last ses-
sion of Congress a call was made, by a resolution
of the Senate, for part, at least, of the information
called for by the present resolution, and a íeport
was made, comprising between two and three
hundred pages of matter Subsequently to that,
a call was made upon the same depaitment—the
Bureau of Indian Affairs—for the veiy same cor-
respondence, and the same documents contem
plated by the present resolution That call was
made on the 23d of December, 1833, and it took,
Mr P was informed, the cleiks employed in that
department, not only duung the last session, but
also the whole of the recess to respond to it He
objected, therefore, to a call being made for the
same correspondence and the same documents,
unless some strong and substantial reasons should
be assigned for it Mr P had made some inquiiy,
and he found that it not only took up a great por-
tion of, but he believed all the time that could be
spared by the four íegularcleiks in the Buieau of
Indian Affairs, and in addition to that the extra clei k
j hire amounted to $1,800, to furnish the otner
branch of the Legislature with the answer to their
call This was paid out of the old contingent fund,
and something like if 1,000 more was paid for such
I paitof the same intoimaüon as came from the
I Commissary Geneial's Department, in addition
to the expense of obtaining eight hundred pages
of the information from the Second Auditor's
Office He found, furthermore,upon inquiry,that
this document, the punting of which was not yet
completed, would comprise six large volumes, of
upwards of six thousand pages, cost the Govern-
ment $12,750, and its binding, at the usual rate,
would cost about $3,250 the whole sum, together
with the punting and binding, would be $16 0U0
[ This, added to the expense of clerk hue, would
make about $19 000, which the Government had
' already paid, or would soon have to pay, for this
I same correspondence, and those same documents
contemp'ated in the lesolution of the gentleman
I from Indiana Moreover the gentleman's resolu-
I tion not only made a call upon the Indian Bureau,
| but also upon the General Land Office, and Mr
i P had good authority for saying that this call
I could not possibly be answeied during the present
session, nor probably during the rece&a, without
the employment of much additional clerk hire,
and consequently an additional appropr ation for
that clerk hire He would remind the House, also,
that the old contingent fund out of which the
$1,800 were paid last year for extia cleik hire in
the Indian Bureau, was exhausted, and therefore
the House would be called upon to pay a sum,
something like $10 000, if it cost no more than the
Senate document, but he believed the call contem-
plated by the present resolution would involve
twice that sum For the purpose of giving time
foi investigating the subject, Mr P said, he would
conclude by moving that the furthei consideration
of the lesolution and amendment be postponed till
Monday next
Mr McCARTY said he would accept the
amendment of the gentleman from Mississippi
[Mi  Pidmmer] as a modification of his own
Mr PLUMMER mubt still insist on his motion
to postpone, because he considered the subject
deserving of more investigation before the final
action of the House was taken upon it He sup-
posed that all the gentleman wanted was the cor
respondence in relation to particular Indian trea-
ties, and Mr P thought the gentleman had better
modify his resolution accordingly
The motion to postpone the 'urther considera-
tion of the resolution till Monday next, was then
taken, and negatived without a division
Mr CLAY-said it appeared to him that the
