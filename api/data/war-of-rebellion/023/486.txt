have more doubt of, but if held it seems to me it should be strongly. Enemy is probably approaching this way if moving at all. Estimated of his strength from 20,000 to 30,000 men, with over forty guns. Have telegraphed Gilbert in regard to leaving part of Dumont's force at Lebanon.

Brigadier General J. T. BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

Should like to keep a force at Lebanon, but if attacked it could not be supported and would most likely be cut off. It should come in. I have reports that Kirby Smith, with 30,000 rebels, was in Paris this morning. This don't look like an advance on Louisville, as he can't have force to divide up.

Captain H. C. McDOWELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Louisville, Ky.:

Major-General, Commanding.

LOUISVILLE, KY., September 5, 1862.

Major-General WRIGHT:
