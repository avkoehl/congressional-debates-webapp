CAMP NEAR FORT ROYAL FORD, May 18, 1864.

Colonel TAYLOR:

Commanding Cavalry Division:

COLONEL: I arrived at this point last night about 11 o'clock. I met with no obstacle in the shape of rebels. This morning I made a close reconnaissance form the highest positions, but failed to discover anything. The citizens say that thirty of Mosby's men were here last week. I don't believe there is any force in Front Royal. The river is not fordable at any point. I have two scouting parties out, one to Morgan's Ford and the other to Berry's Ferry. I shall try and get all the information possible.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

MAT. BERRY,

Captain, Commanding.

CAMP NEAR FRONT ROYAL,

May 18, 1864-7 p.m.

Colonel TAYLOR,

Commanding Cavalry Division:

COLONEL: I am unable to give you any information more than was forwarded this morning. My scouting parties have met with no rebels. It was reported to one of the officers that some of Mosby's men were still on this side of the river, on account of the river not being fordable. I shall send a strong party after them to-morrow, and, if possible, will try and hunt them up. I think I shall go in command myself. The sergeant that was sent to your headquarters has not returned as yet.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

MAT. BERRY,

Captain, Commanding.
