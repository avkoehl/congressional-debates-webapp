HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,Copsa's, Va., June 9, 1864-5.30 a.m.

Major-General BUTLER:

Colonel Hawley will approach Petersburg by the City Point road, General Hinks on the Jordan's Point road. General Kautz is well in advance, with directions to approach on the Jerusalem road. I recommend that the pickets of the Spring Hill garrison be increased and thrown forward beyond Rushmore's as a demonstration.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Elick Jordan's, June 9, 1864-12. 30 p.m.

Major-General BUTLER:

I found the enemy prepared for me to all appearances. A prisoner says our movement was known at 1 this morning, and that re-enforcements arrived by railroad. General Hinks, on the Jordan's Point road, says he cannot carry the work in his front, and that since he arrived there at 7 a.m. two more regiments have been added to the intrenchments, coming from the city. In Hawley's front the works are as strong, I should think, as our own on Terry's front. In my opinion, they cannot be carried by the force I have. Distant firing on my extreme left has been heard for the last hour and a half. I, therefore, judge that Kautz finds himself opposed. I am about to withdraw from under fire in the hopes of hearing from him.

Very respectfully, &c.,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.

JUNE 9, 1864-2.20 p.m.

General GILLMORE:

Your dispatch of 12.30 received. I grieve for the delay in getting off the expedition this morning. I hope Kautz has been more successful in getting in. You do not speak of any loss. I send you a note* from Surgeon McCormick, which please preserve. Not on the ground, I cannot advise. No troops have passed over railroad or turnpike since 6 o'clock this morning.

Yours,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Near Baylor's Saw-Mill, June 9, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

General Hinks, who was on the left, says the last firing from General Kautz was heard at 12 o'clock, apparently just where it commenced. After waiting under the intrenchments until about 1 o'clock to hear further from him I gradually withdrew to Baylor's, and then
