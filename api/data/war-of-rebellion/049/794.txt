HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,October 19, 1863.

Brigadier General J. D. IMBODEN,

Commanding, &amp;c., Staunton, Va.:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 14th instant is received. After my letter of the 9th, the army moved against General Meade, who retreated rapidly and was forced to retire into Fairfax County. We then returned to the Rappahannock. The cavalry is still in Fauquier County, and until its withdrawal I wish you to continue to scout toward the gaps of the mountains, to secure if from any advance in that direction. Your plan of keeping the enemy at the lower end of the valley is approved, and i hope you may be able to break up the railroad.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

Brigadier General A. R. LAWTON,

Quartermaster-General, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: I have received your letter of the 12th instant, and am very glad to find that your exertions to supply the army habe been so successful. The want of the supplies of shoes, clothing, overcoats, and blankets is very great. Nothing but my unwillingness to expose the men to the hardships that would have resulted from moving them into Loundon in their present condition induced me to return to the Rappahannock. But I was averse to marching them over the rough roads of that region, at a season, too, when frosts are certain and snows probable, unless they were better provided to encounter them without suffering. I should otherwise have endeavored to detain General meade near the potomac, if I could not throw him to the north side.

The supplies you now have at your disposal for this army will be most welcome, and I rust that your exertions to increase them will meet with full success.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

Major General J. E. B. STUART,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: Your note announcing your victory over General Kilpatrick, by your combined divisions, has been received. I congratulate you and your officers and men on this handsome success. The plan was well conceived and skillfully executed. It is not my design for you to advance or to cross the Potomac, but to withdraw on the line formerly designated, when you think it advantageous to do so. I have ordered the iron from the railroad for some miles north of the Rappahannock to be hauled the river. I desire you, while this operation continues, to have a brigadier near the railroad, with
