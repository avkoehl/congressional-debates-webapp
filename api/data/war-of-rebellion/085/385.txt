SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 26, 1864.

Brigadier General THOMAS EWING:

Your dispatch 3.30 received. When the affair is over let me know about sending the arms in question.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

PILOT KNOB, September 26, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I can hold the fort against 4,000 or 5,000 cavalry and four pieces of artillery. I think I am now informed to my satisfaction that the enemy has more than [that] at Fredericktown. I am sure he has that much. The force with which we were engaged east of Ironton this p. m. numbered 200 or 300 only. They withdrew after an hour's desultory firing. The losses on both sides were light. The exact amount I have not ascertained. I shall send up to-night the extra quartermaster's and commissary stores here, which were sent against my remonstrance in large quantities on the 1st instant. My advance is again attacked in large force, and are being driven in. Evidently a considerable body of the enemy are upon me. You must exercise your judgment as to distribution of troops.

THOS. EWING, Jr.,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 26, 1864.

Major-General EWING,

Pilot Knob:

Your last dispatch giving corroborative information has been received. Your views are approved. You can probably make it too expensive for the rebels to take the Knob. The arms will be sent to De Soto with a special messenger, to the care of the commanding officer there to await your orders. If you had the militia with you in the fort you could whip all the rebs can bring.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 26, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING,

Pilot Knob:

General Smith telegraphs me from Mineral Point 9.25 p. m. I have left matters with your post to his direction. Take orders from and confer with him, yet keep me always advised of all matters of importance.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

PILOT KNOB, September 26, 1864.

Major-General SMITH:

I am advised by Major Wilson, commanding at the front, that the rebels are massing a large force in his front in Arcadia Valley, two miles from here. There is no doubt that it is intended to attack here
