DREWRY'S BLUFF, May 9, 1864-5 p.m.

Major CHESTNEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Richmond:

Let Custis Lee remain at Manchester.

T. ROWLAND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

DREWRY'S BLUFF, May 9, 1864-7.30 [a.m.]

General B. R. JOHNSON,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I have nothing of interest to communicate this morning. It was supposed in Richmond that the enemy was retreating. My scouts report that he has occupied a fortified line running from river to river. I have no reports from the front yet. Nothing yet from General Lee of his operations on yesterday. A heavy cannonade was reported to be going on near Ely's Ford up to 11 a.m., when it ceased. Deserters tell me that there is a very large proportion of the force in front of us of engineer troops-fully a third. Does your information confirm it? I send a detachment to communicate with you by the turnpike. It is reported that the enemy have not ventured to the Junction since the handsome beating you gave him day before yesterday.

Very respectfully,

S. M. BARTON,

Brigadier-General.

MAY 9, 1864-3.10 p.m. (Received 6 p.m.)

General B. R. JOHNSON,

Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of 1 p.m. just received. We have rumors of a large force moving on Chesterfield Court-House from Chester. A demonstration was made against me this morning. A few shots from picket-line seem to have frightened the party, as I am yet unable to find them. General Ransom, who has just arrived, tells me that General Lee says Anderson pitched into Grant near Spotsylvania Court-House and made heavy slaughter; our loss inappreciable. I am afraid you have had all the luck with these people about us. They must abandon their enterprise on hearing of Grant's disasters.

Very respectfully,

S. M. BARTON,

Brigadier-General.

MAY 9, 1864.

Major T. O. CHESTNEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Nothing new this morning. All quiet. Have ordered the cavalry to feel the position. No reports from the front. The enemy's cavalry came up to the outer line of mounted vedettes in the night and retired.

S. M. BARTON,

Brigadier-General.
