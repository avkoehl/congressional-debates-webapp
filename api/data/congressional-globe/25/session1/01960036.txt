follows tjiat an ir crease 11 the amount ol the c ur-
reney, by the ad a it.n tf a paper t irt lation ol to
intrinsic Vdlut, 1 m in> reasts ¡he nominal y alue of
the aggregate pro] er'y ot the country in the saire
■proportion that t'ie inert ase bears to ike -«hole
amount of curren} , s  that, if the currency be
•doubled, the nrmmal valu* of the property will al°o
i>e doubled Hence it is that when the paper cur-
rency of a countr) is m the shape of pioimssorv
Jiotes, there is a cca ant tendency to excess We
look for their safety to the al-ility of'he dravvej,
and ao long as his means are amfle to meet his
engagements the-e is no distrust, without leilect
itlg that, considered as currency it cannot «afely
exceed one m thirty in valce compared to property,
and the delusion is further increased by the con
stant increase in value of propel iv, with the increase
of the uotes in circulation, so as to maintain the
i>ame relative proportion it follows that a Goy
ernment may safely contract a debt, many times
the amount of it  aggregate circulation, but, if it
were to attempt to put its piomissoiy notes in circu-
lation in amount equal to its debts, an ex losion m
the currency would be inevitable And hence,
with other causes, the constant tendency to an ex-
cessive issue of hank notes in prospei ous times,
•when so large a poruon of the community are anx-
ious to obtain accommodation, and who are disap
cowled when negotiable paper is refused by the
banks, not reflecting that it w ould not be safe to dis
count beyond the limits I have assigned for a safe
Circulation, however good the papei offeicd
On what, then, ought a paper cu rency to rest i
I would sav on demand and supply simph which
regulates the value of ev ery thing else—the con
slant demand which the Government has on th 
community for its necessary supplies A medium,
resting on this demand, which simply obligates the
Ctoyeinmcntto teceiveit mall of its dues, to the ex-
clusion of even thmg else, except gold and silver,
and which shall be optional v> ith tho«e v ho have
demands on Government to receive or rot, would,
it seems to me, be as sable in us value as those
metals themselves, and be as hale liable to abuse
as the power of coming It w ould contain withm
itself a self reguhting power It could only be is-
sued to those w bo had claims on the Government,
and to those only with their consent, and, of course,
only at or above par with gold and silver, which
would be its habitual state, foi -sfai as the Gov
ernment was concrete I if v\ ould be equal, in ev ery
respect, to gold and silver, and •> ipenor in many,
patticularly in regulating the distant exchanges of
the country Should, however, a demand for gold
and sflyei lrom abroad or othei accidental causes,
depress it tem¡.oniilv, a conpaied with the pre
Cicus metals i won d then re urn to ¡he Ticasuiy,
and as it could not be paid ou' durm^ such de
pression Us giadual diminution m the market
would soon res ore it to an equality, when it w ould
again flow out into the general circulation Thus
there would be a const tnt alternate flux and reflux
into and from the Treasury, between it and the pre-
cious metals, but if at any time a petmanentde
pression m its v alue be possible from any cause,
the only efect wculdbe to operate as a reduction
of tax<H on tli  community and the onlv sufferer
wo lid be the C vern nent i'self Against Ins, its
o-vn n eiest would bo a sufhcient guaran ee
Nothing but experience can determine what
amount and of what denominations might be safelv
issued, bui it maj hz safely assumi d that the coun
nv would abscub an amouu' grea ly exceeding its
annual income Much ol its exchanges, which

per -tnnim I speak on 'he irfoim-tion of cnizens
of tin' State, ©ft whom I can relv
Bit', whatever may be the amount thai can be
cuculated, I hold it clear that, to that amount, it
would be as stable tn value as gold and silvet jNelf,
p ov id-i1 the G ivcrnment be bound to recei' e it
txel isively w ith those mdak in all its tiues, and
that it be left perfectly optional with those who
have clam  on the Government to íeceive it or not
It will also be a necessai) condition that notes of
too small a denomination si ould not be issued, so
that the Tieasury si all haye ample means to meet
all demands, eiiher m gold or silver, ot the bills of
the Government, at the option ct those who have
claims on it With these conditiors no faiiher
variation could take place between it and gold and
siher, than that which would be cau-ed by the
action of commerce An unusual demand fiom
abroad for the meláis would, of couise, raise them
a little in their relative y alue and dcpiess rela-
tively, the Government bills in the same propor-
tion, w hich vv ould cause them to flow into the Trea-
surv , and gold and silv er to flow out while, on the
contrary, an increased demand for the bills m the
domestic exchange would have the reverse effect,
causing, as I have slated, an alternate flux and
reflux into the Treasury, between the two, which
would at all times keep their relativ c values either
at or near par
No one can doubt that the fact of the Government
receiving and paying away bank notesm all its fiscal
transactions is one of the principal sources of their
great circulation, and it was mainly on that ac-
count that tne notes of the late Bank of the United
States so freel} circulated all over the Union I
ti ould ask, then, wh> should the Government mm
gle its credit with that of private corporations1
No one can doubt but that the Gov eminent credit
is better than that of any bank—more stable and
more saie Why then should it mix it up with
the less perfect credit of those institutions1 Why
not use its own credit to the amount of its own
transactions'* Why should it not be safe m its
own hands, while it shall be considered safe m
the hands of eight hundred private institutions
scattered all ovei the country, and which have
no other objtct but then own puvafe profits, to
mciease whiel, they almost constantly e\ end
then business to the most dangeious extremes''
And why should th  community be compelled to
give six pei cent discount foi the Government
credit blended with that of the banks, when the
superior credit of the Government could be fur
nished separately without discount, to the mutual
adv antage of the Government and the community t
Why, let me ask should the Government be ex-
posed to such difficulties as the present, by min-
gling its credit with the banks, when it could be
exempt ftom all such by using by itself its own safer
ciedn,l It is tune the community, which has so
deep an inteies in a sound and chop currency
end tne equality of the laws between one porüon of
the citizens and the countiv and another, should
reflect set louslv on these things, not for the pur
pose of oppressing any interest, but to correct gra
dmllv disordeis of a dangerous character, which
have insensibly in the long course of years, wdho it
being perceived by any one ciept into the state
The question is not between credit ard no ciedit,
as somewoald have us believe, but in what foim
credit can best perform the functions of a sound
and safe currency On this impottant point I have
fieely thiown out my ideas, lea\mg it to th'sbody
and the public to determine what they are w orth
Believing th t there might be a sound ai d *a'e
papei emiency founded on the credit of Gov ern
ment Cvc'usiveiv I was desirous that those who
?ie íesponsible and have the power should have
avai'ed themselves of the opportunity of the tern
porary deficit of the Tieasury, and the pospone
ment of the to irth instalment in'ended to te depo
sit d with the Slates to n«e them as the means of
aflbidinga cnculation for the present relief oí th 
country and the banks, dminc the piotess of sepa
ratmsr them from Government, and, if experience
shou'd jus ífy i , ol furnishing a permanent and
safe circula!ion which would grea h facilitate the
opeiations of  he Treasuiy, and afiord mcidenta'ly
much facility to the commercial operations of the
countiv But a diherent direction was given, and
when the eitcmative was presented of a loan or
th  withholding the fourth instalment from the
fetd'es, 1 did not hesitate to g've a decided vote for
withholding it My aversion to a public debt is
deep and durable !• is m raj opinion, pernicious,
and is little short of a fraud on the public I saw
too much of it during the late n ai not to understand
something of the nature and character of public
loans Nev er w as a country more egregiously im-
posed on.
Having now presented rov views of the course
and the naeasuies which the permanent policy ol the
country, looking to its liberty and lasting prosperity,
requires, I come finally to the question of relief
I have placed this last, not that I am devoid of
sy mpathy for the country m the pecuniary distress
v hich now pervades it No one struggled earlier
or longer to prevent it, than myself, nor can any
one more sensibly feel the wide spread blight,
which has suddenly blas'ed the hopes of so many,
and precipitated thousands fioro affluence to pover-
ty The desolation has fallen mainly on the mer-
cantile class—a class which I have evei held in
the highest estimation No country ever had a
supenoi body of merchants, of higher honor, of
mote daring enterprise, oi of greater skill and
eneisy The rum of such a class is a heavy ca-
lamity , and I am sohci ous, among other things, to
giv e such stability to our currency as to prev ent the
lecurreiice of a oimilai calamity hereaftei But it
wa« first necessai y, m the order of things, that we
should determine what sound policy, looking to the
future, demands to be done at the present juncture,
before we consider the question of relief, which,
a.-, mgent as it may be, is subordinate and must
yield to the former The patient lies under a dan-
gerous disease, with a burning thirst and other
symptoms, which distresses him moi e than the vital
organs which are attacked The skilful physician
fitst makes himself master of the nauire ot the dis-
ease, and then determines on the trea ment neces-
sary for the reslorauon of health This done, he
next alleviates the distressing symptoms, as far as
is consistent with the restoiation of 1 ealth, and no
farther Such shall be my t ourse As far as I
possibly can, consistently with the views I enter-
tain, and what I believe necessary to restore the
body politic to health, I will do every thing m my
power to mitigate the present distress Farther I
cannot go
Aftei the best leflection, I am of the opinion that
the Government can do but hule m the way of
teliel, and toat t is a case which must be mainly
leiuo tne constitution of tie panent, who, thank
God, is young, vigorous, and íobust, with a consti-
tution sufficient to sustain and overcome the se-
verest attack I dread the doctor and his drugs
much more than the disease itself The distress of
the countiy consists in its inc'ebtedness, and can
only be rehev ed by pay ment of its debts To effect
this, industry, frugality, economy, and time, are
necessary I rely more on the growing crop—on
the cotton, rice, and tobacco of the [South—than on
all the projects or devices of politicians I am ut-
terly opposed to all coercion by this Government
But Government may do something to relieve the
distress It is out of debt, and is one of thepunci-
pal e i ed ors both of ih  banks and of the merchants,
and should set an example of liberal indulgence
This I am willing to give freely I am also pre-
pared to vote freely the use of Government credit,
in some safe foim, to supply any deficit m the cir-
culation during the process of recovery, as far as
its financial wants will permit I see not what
more can be safely done But my vision may be
obtuse upon this subject 1 hose w ho differ from
me, and w ho pi o<ess so much sympathy for the pub-
he, beem to think that much íelief may be afforded
I hope they w ill present then views 1 am anxious
to hear their prescriptions, and I assure them, that
whatever they may piopose, if it shall promise re-
lief and be not inconsistent v ith the couise which
I deem ahsolu ely necessary for the restoration of
the country to perfect heal'h, shall cheerfully re-
ceive my suppor* They may be more keen sighted
than I am, as to the best means of relief, but cannot
have a stronger disposition to afford it
We hate, Mr Pievl nt, arrived at a remarkable
era in out political history The days of legislative
and executive encroachments, of tariffs and sur-
pluses of bank and public debt, and exttavagant
expenditure, are past ior the present The Gov-
ernment stards in a position disentangled from the
past and fiecr to choose its future course than it
ever has been since its commenceme it We are
aoout to take a fresh start I mote off under the
State rights banrer, and go m the direction which
I have been so long moving I seize the opportu-
nity fhoioughly to reform the Government, to bring
it back to its original pnreiples , to retrench and
economize, and rigidly to enforce accountability
I shall oppose strenuously, all attempts to ori-
ginate a nev debt to create a national bank, to
reunite the political and money powers (more dan-
gerous than   Church and State) m any fort  of
