ception of two companies under command of Major Tweeddale, has been sent to Lake Providence, for duty under Major-General McPherson. The companies here are employed extracting stumps, and will put up the steam dredge daily expected. Another steam dredge, ordered here, will be used at Lake providence, if needed. By direction of the major-general commanding, nothing will be done at present toward cutting the proposed opening through the woods in the bottoms toward Johnson's Bayou or Crevasse. The water is falling. The fall for the past three days has averaged between 1 and 2 inches. Captain Kossak, on examination of batteries opposite the outlet of the canal, reports three-one in casemate, nearly enfilading the canal. None of these batteries have opened as yet, and from appearances they would seem to have but one gun in each. Lieutenant Lochbihler's company is employed, when the weather is favorable, in preparing gabions and fascines. We have one hundred and twenty of the latter and some thirty of the former; these are made from vines, which are in great abundance. As soon as practicable, frames for magazines and timber for casemates will be provided. No instructions with respect to the construction of batteries have as yet been received.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FREDERICK E. PRIME,

Captain of Engineers.

Brigadier General JOSEPH G. TOTTEN, Chief Engineer of the Army.

[P. S.]-Fall of river at Memphis reported as over 6 feet.

STEAMER MAGNOLIA,

Opposite Vicksburg, March 1, 1863.

GENERAL: I have tho honor to report as follows with respect to operations on canal since my last, of 21st instant [ultimo]: 22nd and 23rd, little or nothing done-rain; 24th, 25th, and of 26th, at work-favorable weather; 27th and 28th, no work-rain, and water high. To-day is a fine day; wind from northwest, and mud drying rapidly. No work outside of the main levees, on account of high water and the river still rising. The dams outside of levees have been overflowed, and pump cannot work. One steam dredge is here, and will go to work tomorrow. There are over 1,000 contrabands here. The six-gun battery below mouth of canal is progressing favorably, and, I trust, will be ready for the guns in about three days. Shall send by to-day's mail, under separate envelope, tracing of map of Vicksburg and neighborhood, prepared by Captain Pitzman,* General Sherman's topographical officer.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FREDERICK E. PRIME,

Captain of Engineers.

Brigadier General JOSEPH G. TOTTEN, Chief Engineer of the Army.
