DURHAM'S April 25, 1865.

General SHERMAN:

Your communication to General Johnston has been forwarded by staff officer, and will have answer at the earliest possible moment. Have you any further orders for me? Answer.

J. KILPATRICK,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Raleigh, N. C., April 25, 1865.

General KILPATRICK,

Durham's:

No orders further than to hold your command well in hand ready to move on notice, but no movement will be made until after the interview between Generals Johnston and Sherman has terminated. Please have about twenty horses ready, as General Howard, Schofield, and probably Blair, will go up with the general. The dismounted men will go up with your train in the morning, as the locomotives cannot haul a sufficient number of cars to accommodate them.

L. M. DAYTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Raleigh, N. C., April 25, 1865.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding Department of North Carolina:

GENERAL: You may make your orders to start to-morrow at 12 m. toward the enemy wherever we may find him, and instead of following the route prescribed in Special Field Orders, Numbers 55, you may cover the railroad and follow it substantially in the direction of Greensborough and Salisbury. Colonel Wright will be ordered to repair it behind us as far as the Company's Shops, in Alamance County.

I am, &amp;c.,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Raleigh, N. C., April 25, 1865.

Major General J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Commanding, &c.,:

GENERAL: The general-in-chief directs me to say that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Battalions Illinois Infantry have been held for guard at railroad bridge, Neuse River. He says a smaller guard will answer there, and he desires the regiment should join its command, Seventeenth Corps.

I am, general, yours, &c.,

L. M. DAYTON,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
