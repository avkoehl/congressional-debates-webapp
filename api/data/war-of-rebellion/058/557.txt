General FORREST,

Grenada:

Dispatch received. As that raid south may be to interfere with your organization, you would do well to keep your eye upon it. I have ordered you a strong regiment from Mobile to report at Oxford. General Johnston says no more news of the raid from Huntsville. Cavalry reported to have gone west from there.

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.

General MAURY,

Two brigades have been sent from General Johnston to General Polk. You can send Clanton's brigade, if you deem it advisable.

Secretary of War.

[JANUARY 14?], 1864.

General HENRY C. WAYNE,

Milledgeville:

The Governor replied that the road is well managed. That cannot be where there is no adequate provision of wood. The officers are inefficient; have produced and do not remedy this state of things. The chief commissary reports that the average time of his train is thirty-six hours. Beg the Governor to consider that the defense of Georgia depends on the management of this State road.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

DALTON, January 14, 1864.

Colonel L. B. NORTHROP,

Richmond:

We are suffering for want of railroad transportation. Our beeves are brought long distances in cars, losing flesh and health. I earnestly suggest that your order that they be butchered when driven to the railroad. It would save three-fifths in transportation and much in the quality of meat. Transportation is a very serious question.

J. E. JOHNSTON.
HEADQUARTERS,Wallace's, near Como, January 14, 1864.

Major General S. D. LEE,

Grenada:

Colonel Morgan's cavalry brigade, estimated at 1,500, and force from Columbus, reached Memphis about 10th instant, making force there 2,500 cavalry and 5,000 infantry. Have only ten days' forage. Speak of raiding south in few days. General Sherman reported raising force to go up Red River.

JAS. R. CHALMERS,

Brigadier-General.
