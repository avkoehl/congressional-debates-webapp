BACK CREEK, July 26, 1864.

(Received 11. 50 p. m.)

General B. F. KELLEY:

I was within three miles of Martinsburg and found about 200 of the enemy on the track. They occupy Martinsburg. I returned to Back Creek and will remain there until morning. It is rumored that they will attack Back Creek in the morning.

P. B. PETRIE,

Captain, Commanding Iron-clads.

NEW CREEK, July 26, 1864.

General KELLEY:

I have every assurance that McNeill is preparing to make a raid on the Allegheny Mountains. There are some 250 head of cattle out there which will fall into his hands unless attended to. If the men could be spared from this place, there might be a trap laid to catch him out there. Say 200 or 300 infantry.

A. HINKLE.

CUMBERLAND, July 26, 1864-2 p. m.

Brigadier-general ROWLEY,

Pittsburg:

Your telegram received. No rebel force has yet been reported at Romney, but we are momentarily expecting them to assail us at some point west of Hancock. Have you any force you could send me, to be returned after this emergency? I am cut off from General Hunter and have but a small force.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

HAGERSTOWN, July 26, 1864.

Major JOHN S. SCHULTZE:

All quiet as yet. Our forces are at Falling Waters, and are moving toward Sharpsburg. Wagon train gone to Harper's Ferry. Crook re-enforced by Wright. I am going to Sharpsburg and Harper's Ferry. No necessity for immediate alarm. Lots of stragglers through the country. Pay no attention to them. Averell's forces will occupy between here and Williamsport. Troops all in good order and spirits.

WM. H. BOYD,

Colonel Twenty-first Pennsylvania Cavalry.
