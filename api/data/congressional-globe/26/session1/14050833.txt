OusiV t'eni>>d b\ the official orsan of the Administration, (ihe

Nay, ihe charje was pronounced false and calummous, and, at

and influence of the Executive in such a degree as to deprive the

The particular abuie under consideration, besides strengthening
toe Execu'ive power, leads to t e neglect and mismanagement
of the pub'ic interest cjnfijed 'o the public officers, by divert-
ing their at' ntion to ihe business of electioneering.
One «tnk>ng and inevitable result of this practice, sanctioned

What, in truth, Mr. speaker, are the hundred thousand office-
holders, or recipients of Government favor in some shape or
other, likely to become under the corrupting maxims and prac-
tices of the Administration) What are most of them at this
moment, but so many feed attorneys, whose puncipal business
and dutj it is to advocate and suppoi t, at all times and upon all
occasions, the measures and policy of the Administration, right
or wrong, and to press the claims of their candidates in all
elections! And, what is still more objectionable, they are paid
from a Treasury replenished out of the substance and hard earn-
ings of the whole people—of both parlies <
sir, how are we to meet this outrage; How are we to re-
press this increasing and daring mischief! It is denied that we
the constitutional power to restrain public officers in the way
proposed by this bill
The late bill of the Senate was compared to the alien and
sedition laws of 1793, and represented as having the same gene-
ral object in view, and founded on the same principles, but
how false and unfounded this view of the subject was, may be
discovered at a glance by any individual of general intelligence
and observation, and the body of the people must soon become
sensible of the same thing The two measures are as opposite
as the poles in object and principle The alien and sedition
laws were designed as a restraint upon the free expression of
opinion, by the people themselves, against the public officers
and their measures The bill of the Senate, and the one now
under consideration, propose to prohibit the office holders from
exercising an undue and improper influence over the people
The alien and sedition laws were intended to protect the public
officers from the sayings and doings of the people, these bills
propose to protect and guard the people against the sayings
and doings of the public officers In the one case, it was the
alleged improper conduct of the people that was proposed to ne
punished, in the other it is the alleged improper conduct of the
public officers that is intended to be prohibited. The tendency
of one measure was to lavor power, of the other to preserve
liberty; and the true friends of liberty every where will soon
learn to make the proper distinction.
The proposition to punish office holders for interfering in
elections has been denounced as a measure comparable in enor-
mity and tyranny only to the Spanish Inquisition < Here, again,
the acute perception of the people of this country will soon
learn to detect the absurdity of comparing this meson re to that
tyrannical institution I have always understood, sir, that the
hierarchy of the Romish church established the Inquisition for
the restraint and pun shment of the lay members (the pe iplel
who dared to intermedd e with matters of Christian faith, and
also of such re'ractory priest or member of the hierarchy itself,
who should dare to question tlf orthodoxy of their principies or
the purity of their practices If I hive not, then, mistaken the
object of that odious instrumental leliginu  tyranny, there is no
analogy, no resemblance whatever, between it and this bill.
On the contrary, it will be found that iheieisa most striking
and remarkable likeness hetween this Administration, its princi
pies and practices, and the upholders and patrons of that infa-
mous tribunal in Spain Both proless to be orthodox in their
creed, and claim that they alone are othodox—the one in reh
gion, and the other in politics Bath denounce all who oppose
them, either in faith or practice, as heietics and apostates and
both pursue tho«e who dare to think for themselves with mex
cable proscription ' But with what reason or propriety can
it he said that a bill which proposes to restrain the impertinent
intermeddling of the high priests of the political church in the
elections instituted to control ihem, is like a Spanish Inquisi-
tionl It is expressly designed to defeat and counteract a practice
established by an insolent and selfish body of mng'atrates and
office holders for the purpose of maintaining their power by
offi -Ml corruption and intimidation
In the report of Mr. Wall ef the Senate, another objection is
stated, very like the one I have just noticed. It was coatended
that the bill of the Senate Would give rise to an odious class ef
vexatious and infamous informéis and spies upon the office
holders. Take it for granted that such would have been the re-
sult of the Senate's bill, could any description of informers
have sprung up under the operation of that bill more odious
and infamous than the swarm of spies upon the public officers
and public men of every class, which for yea's past has afflicted
this country! If what I have s id is not so well known among
the pe >ple, they have at least felt the full measure of the evil in
the blighted interests and prosperity of the country; and the
wretches who live, gratify the r bad passions, and get employ-
ment by the arts of the informer, are not known, because their
information is given in secret, considered in secret, and pro-
mulged only in appointments to and removals from office But
this system of espionage is not confined to the office holders
only, the conduct, the language, and in many instances the veT)
looks of men, both in public and private, have been noted by
these miscreants, either with a view to expel them from em-
ployment, or bring down upon them the d spleascre of the Pre-
sident and his mvrmidon followers In fact,if anyone desires
to see exhib ted tho practices of the Spanish Inquisition, in mat-
ters of State and party politics, let him seek admission into iho
appointing and removing offices of the present Administration
of this free Goverrm<>nt'
Let us t¡ee now how widely diflerent,both in principle and in its
results, would be the practice of inforn ers under the law pro-
hibiting the lnterma'dlina of public officers with elections
Trom the very nature of the case, every thing they do is open
and public—the charge, ihe proof, and ihe decision upon
it 1 he informer stakes his character upon the truth of his in-
for nation, anda piry of the countrymen ot the accused sit upon
upon the charge m open day, and deliver their verdict under
the sarction of a Tederal judge I know Ikneednotsay another
word in answer to this objection
But it is said, that to provide for the pui'ithment of a public
officer for intermeddling with elections would deprive him of
of rights and privileges secured to him by the Constitution;
which, in this case, would be to say and do just what he pleases
in elections, provided he discharges the duties of his office pro
nerly and faithfully The argument is, first, that the Constitu-
tion will allow no restraint on the office holder in abridging any
privilege to which, as a citizen, he would have been entitled.
Yet we have restrained their privileges, in repeate 1 instances,
by laws still standing on our etatute book , as, for instance, m
the taws relating to the establishment of the Treasury Depart-
ment, end prescribing the duties of the officers employed in it.
In these laws it will be found that Congress has exercised the
power to prohibit them from the exercise of any of those right 
and priY&ge  of a ciu*en which wouW interfere with the faith-
H. QfReps.
ful discharge of their official duties. And can there be a greater
inducement for a warm political partisan to neglect or violate
his trust, than the privilege of taking an active part in election ?
In truth, it is one of the greatest temptations that can be placed
in his pith; so great that we know many, very many, hairenot
been able to withstand it The people of this country never
ran be reconciled to the idea that we -annot pass laws to make
oflee holders mind then own business, and meddle not in
things which nece«arily disqualify them for the offices they
hold These reasons will apply with increased weight to the
large class of officers jn the employment of the Poet Office Be-
partmen'. And especially, if the principle of Jefferson be well
founded—if it be good cause ol removal from office lor a pub ic
officer to intermeddle in elections, what principle of reason or
common sense forbids Congress to enforce the observance of it
by law?
But it is objected that this bill proposes to reduce the large
and respectable portion of our citizens who fill the public of-
fices to the condition of serfs—of slaves, to depuve them of
the privilege of speech, and that freedom of action which the
Constitution secures to every citizen' I am astonished at
the cool impudence—the bold disingenuousness of this argu-
ment, considering the source from whence it comes. Who are
they who put it forward, and gravely ask the people to consi.
der «1 The very men who openly maintain and justify the
doctrine that the President may andouiht to remove every one
of those free niizens from office who will not or does not give
his cordial support to the President, his measures, and policy I
It is this debasing, corrupting and proscriptive policy—the po-
licy uphold by these objectors—that would reduce the free born
cunen  who fillthe public offices to the condition of servility
which no high minded and spin ed man can or will endure
None but such as are fit to be slaves will eie long be found in
ths public offices under tins sj stem Instead of oppressing or
tyrannizing over the public officers, this bill proposes to atuke
the manacles from their hands—to set them free' When thev
shall be placed, by the permission of the Executive, upon that
footineof independence andtieedom of which it is said this bill
will deprive them, there will be no rtcesjsity for the remedy
which I propose. It is precisely because those who hold the
po%er m their hands will not permit the public officers to think
audact as they pifase in elections, tho 1 propose that Con
gress shall interpose in then behalf The voluntary lnterfet-
ence of public officers in electl ns, the r Irte and unbiased in-
termeddling will never be an object of alarm or apprehension to
the friends of the Cofetitution It is the involuntary—it is the
constrained interference of pnblic officeis in behalf of power
that is to he feared, and requires a corrective Let the wfole
field of politics be opened i  tl em, let them tale sides at their
opnon, free from the apprehension of proeciiptinn and removal,
and let tl.em be selec ed upon those fice prircipks, aid we
ma) snfelv rely upon their patnoiism and spiiit in maintaining
the Constitution and the true inert ste of the cotinnj. Bui,
sir, according to the admitted and notorious practire ef the
party now unfortunately in posver, docs not every man who
takes employment under the Government sign, seal, and deliver
ai indenture of ah|ect polmcal eeivitude duiing his continu-
ance in office? It is a condition of their appointment and con-
tinuance in office that they shall only speak or act in politics
according to order' Yet it is from tlw supporters ard ad>o
cates of a policy—a practice so repugi ant in all its conte-
quences to the spirit of fieedom and independence—ihat we
Kear the objection to this bill that it will deprive the office
holders of the privilege of speech and action which is secured
to them by the Constitution'
Iti , sir, to securete the office holders these invaluable privi-
leges, that this bill is designed. The most perfect freedom in the
exercise of the elect ve franchise, of the right of speech and of
the press, is what I most desire to see permanently established.
That is undoubtedly what the framers of the Constitution con-
templated, and what they supposed they had succeeded in se-
curing upon the most durable foundation But the interest and
ambition of men in power have defeated the design oft he Con-
stitution in th  respect; and (his bill is intended to restore the
freedom thu* trenched upon by ihe Executive branch of the Go-
vernment, and so entirely unfounded do I regaid this objection,
that I would be willing to insert a proviso to the section under
consideration, that nothing therein contained should be so con-
strue 1 as to violate the right of speech and of the pi ess, as se-
cured by the Constitution Sir, I would fearlessly leave it to the
Judiciaiy to give all the effi.ct to this section which I design it
shall I ave, subject to such a proviso.
To the third section of the bil I, I take it for granted there can
be no serious objection It is intended to provide an adequate
punishment for a class of offences which cannot become very
large until the standard of public morals shall be reduced very
low, and the country, under the operation of the meicenary
maxim by which the appointing and removing power is nowre-
gulated, shall be prepared foi submission to any form of govern-
ment which those at the head of the Administration shall think
proper to establish It is designed, in the first place, lo punish
bribery and corruption in the exercise of the appointirg power,
by the higher officers of the Government This is an offence
which, by the Constitution, may be punished by impeachment.
Without doubt that wocld be the more appropriate remedy, but
it has been manifest for many years past, that we have created
an Executive with powers and patronage so vast and extensive,
as to i=et the impeachine power at defiance We have no resort
in bringing the great officers of the Government to punishment
for filth crimes and misdemeanors, but in the independence of
the Judiciary. It was to supply ihe place of this provision of
the Constitution, rendered abortive by the preponderating influ-
ence of the Executive, that this section was added to the bill.
The necessity of it was suggested to me by having my attention
called to appointments given to some, and the promise of ap-
pointments held out to others, under such circumstances an left
no doubt of the corrupt motive               ...        ■        ,
But, sir, there is another practice, which, whether originating
with the Administration or not. has grown up under Its auspices
to sucli an indecent height as, in my opinion, demands a prompt
and adequate remedy at our hands It is the direct, palpable,
and notorious bribe held out by the Executive to every man of
talent ard influence m the country, to enlist in he service or the
Administration, or, if in it  ranks already to tale a leading and
prominent part m it  support. 1 allude tothe rich rewards
which have been bestowed upo  defeated candidates for popu-
lar suffrage on the side of the Administration, in so many cases,
that there can be no mistake as to the policy or motive to such a
course 1 have repeatedly declared m assemblies of the people,
that the President had, in effect, by apublic proclamation, made
