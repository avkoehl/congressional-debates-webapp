Brigadier-General Wood reports 255 of his men as missing at the action of May 27, and in reference thereto appends to his report a written explanation, of which the following is a copy:

I visited the battle-field of Pickett's Mills twice yesterday and examined it closely. The numerous single graves and several lines of trenches on the battle-field outside of the enemy's intrenchments (capable of containing from twenty-five to forty bodies) fully explain where most of the 255 missing of that day went to. I am fully satisfied that nearly the whole of them were either killed outright on the field or were wounded and could not be brought away, fell into the hands of the enemy when we abandoned the field at 10 p. m. on the 27th.

Respectfully submitted.
