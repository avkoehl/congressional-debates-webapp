a. m. my command advanced in column by company, the One hundred and twenty-ninth Regiment in rear of the right, the One hundred and thirtieth Regiment in rear of left of Colonel Cooper's brigade, who drove the enemy half a mile, establishing our line near strong works of enemy, capturing several prisoners; built barricades on the right of Colonel Cooper's command; posted One hundred and twenty-ninth and One hundred and thirtieth Regiments in front, who continued skirmishing with the enemy until morning of June 17, when they occupied the works of the enemy near the base of Lost Mountain. At 8 a. m. my command moved forward to enemy's works, where we remained until 10 a. m., having deployed three companies in front under command of Captain Robbins, when, in pursuance to orders, at sound of the bugle, the whole command charged the enemy, driving him about one mile and a half, when a halt was ordered. My command being in dense woods and under orders to conform to the movements of Colonel Bond's brigade, the One hundred and twenty-third Regiment, Major Walters commanding, continued to move forward half a mile, and were about to charge a rebel battery when I halted them and rejoined the brigade, the whole command behaving most gallantry. At 5 p. m. the command moved one mile and a half to the right, encamping near the enemy's works in support of colonel Bond's brigade, where we remained until 10 o'clock June 19, heavy skirmishing continuing, when we moved through the enemy's works, across Muddy Creek, and took position near a creek on the right of General Hooker's command, leaving the One hundred and thirtieth Regiment near Muddy Creek to guard ammunition train, and was rejoined by that regiment at 10 a. m. June 20. The command remained in position, our pickets connecting with the pickets of Twentieth Corps, until 10 a. m. June 22, when the whole command moved to the right, my command taking position on the right of a road near the residence of Charles W. Manning, where we hastily constructed barricade of rails and earth. The Fourteenth Kentucky Regiment, being sent forward, engaged the enemy in force about 300 yards from our works, and, in pursuance to orders, retired within the works, when the One hundred and twenty-third Regiment Indiana Volunteers, by well-directed fire, aided in checking the advance of the enemy. The firing continued until 10 p. m., when we advanced our skirmish line. We continued strengthening our works until evening of June 23, when Colonel Swaine arrived with Ninety-ninth Ohio Regiment and assumed command of the brigade.

In closing this report, it is with feelings of deepest pleasure that I can bear testimony to the coolness and gallantry of the officers and men of the brigade I have had the honor to command, they having cheerfully obeyed every order and discharged every duty promptly and rendered me every assistance desired.

I herewith inclose a list of casualties of my command from June 9 to June 24, 1864.*

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN C. McQUISTON,

Commanding Second Brigade.

Brigadier General MILO S. HASCALL.
