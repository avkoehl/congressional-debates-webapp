Major General FITZ LEE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

Have you sent orders to Rosser about keeping himself between the enemy and Richmond? If not, do so.

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS, March 24, 1865.

Brigadier General M. W. GARY,Commanding Cavalry:

General Longstreet wishes you to put a force of 100 of your dismounted men, in addition to the usual mounted picket, at the crossing of the North Fork and White Oak Swamp. They will intrench themselves and prepare to hold the crossing. They will also destroy the poles on the crossing. General Steuart has been ordered to place a regiment on picket at Mrs. Hobson's and to fortify. This will not relieve your cavalry at that point, which will continue there as usual. Captain Sims tells me that you know the crossing of the North Fork as Long Waters.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
