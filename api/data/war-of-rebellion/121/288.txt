SALISBURY, February 21, 1865.

Major General ROBERT F. HOKE, Wilmington, N. C.:

The Secretary of War has sent me repeated orders to send prisoners to Wilmington. Captain Hatch, agent for exchange, will be there, i suppose by agreement with the Federal authorities.

BRADLEY T. JOHNSON,

Brigadier-General.

GOLDSBOROUGH, February 21, 1865.

General BRAGG:

Have seen dispatch of President Davis to you. Please direct General Holmes to stop prisoners at Raleigh, unless it is certain an exchange can be effected. The moving them to and from takes up the transportation and prevents the moving away the supplies which have accumulated at this point.

L. S. BAKER,

Brigadier-General.

GOLDSBOROUGH, February 21, 1865.

General BRAGG:

Colonel Hatch telegraphs that he has Grant's order for exchange of prisoners at Wilmington. He wishes to go immediately through to Wilmington. Is it worth while for him to go on? Answer as soon as possible.

L. S. BAKER,

Brigadier-General.

FEBRUARY 21, 1865.

General L. S. BAKER;

Colonel Hatch must not come.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

WILMINGTON, February 21, 1865.

Colonel HATCH, Agent for Exchange:

(Care of General Baker, Goldsborough.)

No prisoners should be brought this side of Goldsborough. The Federal commander refuses to entertain any proposition in regard to them, and avails himself of our embarrassment to push his operations. We are obliged to send away what we have.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

GOLDSBOROUGH, February 21, 1865.

General BRAGG:

Shall I send prisoners back to Salisbury this evening?

L. S. BAKER,

Brigadier-General.

GOLDSBOROUGH, February 21, 1865.

[General BRADLEY T. JOHNSON], Commanding Officer:

Send [no] more Federal prisoners to this point for the present. The Yankees at Wilmington refuse to receive them.

L. S. BAKER,

Brigadier-General.
