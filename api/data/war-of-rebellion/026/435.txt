HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS,Fort Monroe, October 21, 1862.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

GENERAL: I have an arrangement with a man who has the means of obtaining accurate information in regard to affairs in Richmond and the districts lying upon the James River, the Chickahominy, and the Blackwater. I have no secret-service fund, but I allow him to carry some articles for peddling in the districts referred to and to bring back tobacco. He has crossed the lines without suspicion four times in his wagon, and will leave here in two or three days.

The forces of the enemy in Richmond and the country on this side are as follows:

At Franklin, on the Blackwater, under General French ...... 4,000

At Zuni, on the Blackwater, under General Pettigrew ....... 5,000

At Wakefield, 8 miles from Zuni, under General Anderson ... 2,000

At Petersburg one regiment, about ......................... 800

At Richmond ............................................... 7,000

Between the James and Chickahominy, under General Wise, in-

cluding a cavalry regiment just arrived from Georgia ...... 7,000

Between Richmond and White House two regiments, just sent

there, about .............................................. 1,500

-----

Total .....................................................27,300

From other and less reliable sources I get nearly the same result.

My informant says there is no intention of moving down the Peninsula in force until the naval armament is complete. The Richmond (and the new Merrimac) has taken out her boilers, which were found too small, and others are in course of construction. He thinks she cannot be ready for a month.

I shall be advised of any intended general movement unless my man falls under suspicion and is not allowed to go at large. He has a pass from the Government at Richmond to peddle in Henrico County, and has no difficulty in crossing the lines and reaching me by way of Williamsburg.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

SIR: I have the honor to inclose a dispatch received by telegraph from the Secretary of War.* Will you please advise me whether it has been communicated to you; also whether it will be considered by you as sufficient to warrant the passage of vessels from the Nansemond and Yorktown, with exports, under my permits?

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
