HARRISBURG, PA., July 27, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

The Governor will furnish transportation to as many of the volunteers as will go home if you will dispatch him early to- morrow morning. The National Government will refund the State the money. I think a telegram in these words will answer: 'Send the Pennsylvania Volunteers to their respective homes. A U. S. paymaster will at once follow and pay them off. This Government will refund to the State the cost of such transportation." Do this early in the morning, as they ought by all means to be sent away from here.

J. D. CAMERON.

ENOCH LEWIS,

General Superintended, Altoona:

Furnish transportation at once at Harrisburg for Colonel Rowley to remove all disbanded troops that belong to Pittsburg and Western Pennsylvania. Take vouchers from proper officers for service performed, and the Government will settle with you for it.

SIMON CAMERON.

We have acted on your instructions, and will do all we can to move the disbanded troops from Harrisburg.
