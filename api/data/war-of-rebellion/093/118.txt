advice, and for his success in selecting every position we occupied from Pulaski to Franklin. To General Whitaker, who commanded the First Division up to Columbia; to General Kimball, who succeeded him, and to General Wagner, commanding the Second Division, I am under many obligations for the zeal in carrying out my plans and orders.

To the members of my staff much is due for the cheerful and thorough manner in which they discharged their constant and severe duties during the campaign. Colonel J. S. Fullerton, assistant adjutant-general and chief of staff; Colonel W. H. Greenwood, inspector of the corps; Major William H. Sinclair, assistant adjutant-general; Major J. W. Steele, aide-de-camp; Captain S. J. Firestone, acting aide-de-camp, and Captain L. L. Taylor, aide-de-camp-all were most zealous in the discharge of their duties. Colonel Greenwood's duties were particularly important and thoroughly attended to.

To Captain Lyman Bridges, chief of artillery; to Colonel Hayes, chief quartermaster; to Surg. J. T. Heard, medical director; Captain Hodgdon, chief commissary, and to Captain Tousley, chief of ambulance corps, and Lieutenant Laubach, quartermaster at corps headquarters, I am much indebted for the efficient manner in which they discharged their respective duties.

Before closing this report I will mention the names of Colonel Opdycke, One hundred and twenty-fifth Ohio Volunteer Infantry; Colonel Conrad, Fifteenth Missouri Veteran Volunteers; Lieutenant Colonel Arthur MacArthur, Twenty-fourth Wisconsin Volunteers; Captain Morgan, assistant adjutant-general, and Captain Tinney, of General Wagner's staff, as some of the officers whom I knew and whom I saw behave services ont hat occasion I have before noticed in a communication to department headquarters.

Although Brigadier General J. D. Cox was not in my command, he was my close neighbor in the battle of Franklin, and I take this opportunity to express to him my thanks for his gallant help at that time.

A list of casualties has already been furnished. A recommendation for promotion will be forwarded.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.

Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff.
