m
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 1,
Secretary stands acquitted before the financial
■world.
At once, in one month's time, it brought
$200,000,000 out of the business of the na-
tions, at home and abroad; brought it from
the Pacific railroad, that offered its bonds at
seven and three tenths per cent, interest in
gold, backed up by a domain equal to many
States of this Union, out of all the enterprises
in which men make investments, and put it in
these bonds of the United States; by men who
were too well acquainted with these matters
not to know clearly whether or not the policy
of the Secretary was'in strict conformity to
the law. He liad thus thrown upon his hands
unexpectedly the sum of $130,000,000 of
money, which was presented to him on the 1st
day of September. On that day he called for
$100,000,000 of the five-twenty bonds. Gen-
tlemen complain and want to know why he did
not call for $130,000,000 of these bonds; I
will tell you why. Here was the subscription
of a single bank for $85,000,000 of these bonds,
and here was a subscription of $200,000,000
in a single month, anu the slightest public
revulsion between the 1st of September and
the 1st December might crush the whole con-
cern. lie therefore acted like a prudent man.
If the whole subscription should fail, with
$50,000,000subsct'ibed by other national banks
and by the resources of tho Treasury he could
take care of tho $100,000,000. When he got
into December and found the money was
actually in tho vaults behind the subscriptions,
and it was not a paper subscription, he called
$20,000,000 more on the 7th of December,
and on the 20th of December he called yet
another $20,000,000. And to show my friend
from Indiana [Mr. Kmut] that he does him
injustice in saying he wished merely to give
these parties longer interest in thus postponing
these latter calls, in calling for $20,000,000
on tho 20th of December, ho gave notice that
the $20,000,000 called on tho 7th of December
would be paid immediately on presentation at
the Treasury, that they would be paid instantly
if they would present them, let he states,
whatever construction those gentlemen may
put on the language of his circular issued in
one condition of things on the 10th of August
and designed to operate on another state of
facts, he states in hia report, and it has never
been contradicted, never by any fact, that all the
use these parties got of this money was three
months and no longer. That was all they got.
Now, Mr. Speaker, this is why he called for
$100,000,000, and not for $1110,000,000, the
cxact amount that had been subscribed. It
was that he might walk safely with the public
interest and tho public funds in his charge,
and feel the strength of the parties subscribing
for them, and see what would bo the vicissi-
tudes of trade, and that the exigencies which
might possibly arise might not find him with
more bonds in the Treasury than he had act-
ually means to meet. The whole amount of
interest these parlies got was only three months.
He carried out the letter of the law, and acted
in every respect as a prudent man in accom-
plishing the result of funding $200,000,000
of five-twenty bonds, which bonds bore an
interest of six per cent., for bonds bearing
. an interest of only five per cent.
Sir, this answers the indictment. If this bo
true, he is entitled to an-acquital, whatever
may be the opinion of this House upon the
cconomy of the operation. He is not arraigned
for want of economy; he is arraigned for a
violation of law. To that indictment he pleads;
to that indictment he has answered. This is
his course of proceeding, and he is ready to
abide the judgment of House.
The gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Beck]
says he pursued a course not warranted by the
Jaw in employing these agents. Mr. Speaker, I
believe that if the gentleman from Kentucky,
who undertook to prove that the Secretary had
not carried out the true meaning of this law
by reading the language of the then chairman
of the Committee of Ways and Means when
the bill was before the House, had read the
paragraph through and not stopped in the mid-
dle of a sentence, drawing his pencil between
the word_s, so that by no accident should he
read the" sentence through, he would himself
have shown to this House that the very course
the Secretary pursued was that foreshadowed
by General Schcnck in the very paragraph of
which my friend from Kentucky read a part.
But not a word of that other portion of the
paragraph did my friend read.
When this funding bill was up there was a
prejudice in this country against that special
agency which had by former Secretaries been
employed exclusively for the negotiation of
former loans. A great banking-house in this
nation had had the exclusive right to negotiate
these loans, and had employed other banking-
houses and other agencies under them at a cost
to the United States of one per cent, instead
of one half per cent.; and they had amassed a
large fortune under this system. And there
was a prejudice against it which the gentleman
from Indiana [Mr. Holman] over the way rec-
ognized and tried to prevent. The gentle-
man from New York, on my left, [Mr. Wood,]
referred to this in the debate when the bill
came back from the committee of conference;
and against that pointMr. Schenck, then chair-
man of the Committee of Ways and Means,
uttered what my friend from Kentucky [Mr.
Beck] read, as follows:
" One of tho modifications to which wo consented to
pur bill was to a part of tho fifth sootion of the Senate
bill that authorized the appointment of agents to
negotiate tho bonds, and provided asurn not exceed-
ing one half of one per cent, for tho expense of pre-
paring, issuing, and disposing of the same. We
objootod to tho employment. of agents, and that part
of tho section was abandoned by tho Souate, but wo
agroed that tho Secretary might use a sum not
exoeodmg one half of ono |>or cent, for the purpose
of engraving, printing, issuing, advertising, and dis-
posing of tho bonds. In doing this it is with tho
assuranco and understanding that thoro will be no
attempt to exercise the power, not given, to appoint
special agents."
Here my friend stopped, right in the middle
of the sentence, and I want to read it out in
order to show that it was contemplated that
the Secretary should do precisely what he did
here—advertise it to the whole world, open it
to everybody, solicit everybody. I will read
what followed, separated only by a pencil mark
of my friend from Kentucky, and a semicolon,
from what he read:
" But they will go on employing and commissioning,
and those who do tho business, whoover they may
be, who oxoroise any agency in putting tho bonds
on tho market, will receive their commission. In
other words, it will opon tho bonds to everybody,
but thoro can bo no special agonts."
Mr. BECK. Now, I wish to ask the gen-
tleman a question.
Mr. DAWES. Very well.
Mr. BECK. Did I not send the gentleman
the book less than a minute after I read from
it, and marked just as it is now ? And I may
say that the meaning of that is open to the
world.
Mr. DAWES. Yes,' my friend was not
guilty of any concealment, and I do not arraign
nim for that. I only say that if he had read
the paragraph through, and not stopped where
he did—that is all—he would have shown that
while the argument of General Schenck was
against this special agency, this exclusive
monopoly which had existed up to that time,
he contemplated the taking of one half of one
per cent., and with that employing anybody
who would work, and giving them such com-
mission as he could agree with them to givo
them, and the paying for it out of this one half
of one per cent. That is what he said, in so
many words. Now, what does the Secretary
do? I have given the list of one hundred and
eighty-three of the banks which have been
appointed depositories, and the advertisement
from February to August was addressed to
everybody, otfering every one of the bank3
one fourth of one per cent, for their efforts in
doing this. And when these men who acted
through the bank in the District of Columbia
took the balance, and he reserved $50,000?000
further for the American market, he provided
that the bank which should take this should
have one eighth of one per cent., and that these
men who took the balance should have the
remainder of the half per cent.
Sir, a word more, and I have done. What
has been the result? My friends have figured
up the enormous amounts which these men
have made, and charged it over to the ex-
penses of the United States. Now, they mado
it, not out of the United States, although if
they made one tithe of it beyond the $375,000
which the Secretary says is all they got out of
the half per cent., if they made a penny beyond
that, it has been by the use of that machinery
which the law of the land has enabled them to
use to their own thrift and profit. But, sir,
take their figures; take the largest of their
figures; take it that it has cost the United
States $3,000,000 to negotiate these bonds;
take it that if the balance of the loan shall
be carried out in the same way, it will cost
$24,000,000; (that is not the fact; there is no
truth in it, though my friends believe it to be
true; the figures are just what I have stated;
but take it as they claim,) and what has the
United States made by the operation? In
negotiating this $200,000,000 they have made
$2,000,000 a year, or $20,000,060 at the end
of ten years, without interest, and $26,000,000
at compound interest, which is now worth
$14,840,000. That is its presentvalue to-day.
Carry out the same arrangement with regard
to the entire loan, and at the end of thirty
years we shall have made $1,773,900,0'OO. Ir.
