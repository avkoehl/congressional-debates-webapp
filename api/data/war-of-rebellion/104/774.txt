Having served faithfully during almost the entire war as general officers, it would be unjust to them to reduce them to their original positions in the army at the close of the war, especially when they have won their present positions by service in the field.

Hoping this may receive your favorable attention, I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Wishing to forward Jeff. Davis and party without delay and having received no instructions to govern me, I have directed that he be placed on board a steamer at this place, forwarded to Parkersburg, Va., and thence by railroad to Washington, to be turned over to the Provost-Marshal-General, U. S. Army. This arrangement appears to me to be not only the safest, but most expeditious. He will be under an ample and efficient guard.

General Wilson has reported to me officially that Jeff. Davis and family; Reagan, Postmaster-General Confederate States, and Colonel Harrison, private secretary; Colonel Johnston, aide-de-camp, and others of Davis' personal staff, were captured at Irwinville, Ga., on the morning of the 10th, at daylight. Clement C. Clay delivered himself to Wilson on the 12th, at Macon, and A. H. Stephens was arrested by General Upton on the 11th, at Augusta. Governor Brown, of Georgia, was also arrested by Wilson on the 4th instant. So it seems the Southern Confederacy and Georgia are done for.
