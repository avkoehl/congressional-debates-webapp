THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 4,
the Sergeant-at-Arms of the Senate, in accord-
ance with the requirement of the act approved
July 15,1870, of all the property of the United
States in his possession ; which was ordered
to lie on the table, and be printed.
He also laid before the Senate the report of
the clerk of the Court of Claims, communica-
ting in obedience to law a statement of all
judgments rendered by that court for the year
ending December 4,1871; which was ordered
to lie on the table, and be printed.
INDIAN SKRVICl! DISBURSEMENTS.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair also
lays before the Senate a communication from
the Second Auditor of the Treasury, transmit-
ting accounts of disbursements for the Indian
service for the year ending June 30, 1871. The
very bulky character of ihis document justi-
fies the Chair in stating that he will not put
the question on an order that it be printed,
unless some Senator desires to have that
motion made, or to have it referred to the Com-
mittee on Printing to examine into the pro-
priety and expense of printing it. It will be
laid on the table for the present, and it can
be referred, when the committees shall be
selected, to the Committee on Printing to
inquire as to the propriety of its printing.
ITALIAN PARLIAMENTARY DOCUMENTS.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair also
lays before the Senate three volumes trans-
mitted to him from the parliament of Italy,
being the report of a parliamentary commis-
sion to inquire as to the enforced circulation
of bank notes and the general question of
specie payments.
Mr. HAMLIN. I suggest that they be
referred to the Committee on the Library when
appointed.
The VICE PRESIDENT. They will lie on
the table for ihe present. They are sent, as
the Chair supposes, from the parliament of
Italy as complimentary to the Senate of the
United States.
Mr. CONKLING. I move that the Senate
adjourn.
The motion was agreed to; and (at two
o'clock and seventeen minutes p. m.) the Sen-
ate adjourned.
HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES..
Monday, December 4, 1871.
In conformity to the Constitution and the
laws, the Forty-Second Congress of the United
States of America convened this day in its
second session. At twelve o'clock m., Hon.
James G. Blaine, Speaker of the House of
Representatives, a member from the State of
Maine, called the House to order.
Rev. J. G. Butler, D. D., the Chaplain,
offered prayer, as follows:
0 Thou who dwellest in the heavens, whose
eyes are in every place, the heart-searching
Jehovah, the Almighty God, boundless in
power, and wisdom, and love, we bow rever-
ently in Thy presence, and acknowledge Thee
our King. Coming with confidence into Thy
presence, as that of a loving father, we thank
Thee for the kiud providence that brings us
together again in the enjoyment of life and of
health; and as we now lift our eyes to Thee,
we ask, O Lord, for Thy rich blessing upon us.
Thou hast given us this great and good land.
The God of our fathers, Thou hast led us, lo
these many years. We have been delivered
from bondage; aud Thou hast made war to
cease. We thank Thee for all Thy goodness,
O God; for Thou art the Giver of every good
gift, the King of kiugs, and the Lord of lords.
Though Thou hast chastened us, Thou hast
not destroyed us. We entreat Thee, in great
mercy continue Thy blessings to us as a people.
Rule Thou in the heart of thy servant, the
President of the United States, and in the
hearts of all those associated with him in
administering the affairs of this Government.
Teach oar Senators wisdom. Preserve in their
integrity those who administer justice in this
land. Give wisdom and courage and patience
and grace to Thy servant, the Presiding Officer
of this House. Bless each herein his relation
to the others; and may we ever be guided by
the kind and blessed agencies of an enlight-
ened Christian manhood. 0 God, give wis-
dom that these, the servants of the people,
maybe so directed in their legislation that the
best interests of this land may be promoted;
that we may be carried forward in the great
work of growth in truth and righteousness and
equity and love and mercy.
Establish Thy kingdom. Enter not into
judgmentwith us for our sins. Help us ever to
walk in Thy fear; and help us so to live that
after this life we may attain eternal joy,
through Jesus Christ our Lord, who hath
taught us to pray :
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed
be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be
done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us
this day our daily bread; and forgive us our
debts as we forgive our debtors; and lead us
not into temptation, but deliver us from evil;
for Thine is the kingdom and the power and
the glory forever. Amen.
