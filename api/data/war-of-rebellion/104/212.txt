Brigadier General T. J. LUCAS,

Commanding Cavalry Brigade:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that so soon as General Garrard's division, of the Sixteenth Corps, has completed the line investing Blakely you will place your command in such position to the north and east of the besieged place as will cover the rear of our troops. All the main avenues by land and river to Blakely must be permanently and strongly guarded, and zealous and effective parties must scour the country along the front of the guards. These patrols will extend as far as Stockton, on the river; Bay Minette Station, on the railroad, and from there, by Stapleton's place, to Holyoke, where they will connect with patrols of Colonel Johnson's brigade, whose headquarters will be near Cyrus Sibley's Mills.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Another detachment placed near Martin Durant's, or Deer Park, will continue your line of patrols, protecting against any attack from beyond Fish River and extending to the village and Montrose Wharf, on Mobile Bay. Before leaving your present position you will supply your command with two days' rations of subsistence and forage.
