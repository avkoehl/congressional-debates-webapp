FORT SUMTER, July 14, 1864 - 8 p. m.

Three hundred and eight shots fired at fort to-day; 29 missed. Very rapid fire during a portion of the day, and no assistance at that time from the island batteries. Afterward, when the fire had slacked considerably, Fort Johnson and Sullivan's Island opened and measurably annoyed them, and interfered with their fire. We want those negroes badly.

The engineer at this post works some 80 men every night on the gorge face without any cover, and where they are infinitely more the boom. The moon only shines now half the night.
