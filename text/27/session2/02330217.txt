heve 1 the Commission must have been selected on the part of
Mexico with the view of preventing the possibility of having a
fur elimination of the claims He believed the Commissioners
had lei 1 before the umpire spurious documen &, and that, instead
of sul milling papers on both sides in many cases only one
side was presented, and the mri| ire was comp lied to proceed
