(Via Atlanta, through Colonel Eggleston.)

Your letter of the 5th is just received. I can put 3,000 men to work on the railroad in a few days, in addition to what the Georgia authorities can and will do. The road can be repaired in about thirty days. A bridge is already framed for the Chattahoochee River. I will do all in my power to meet you be getting out ties, laying track, and building bridges. Tools will be needed, but how many, I don't know. Everything is on the lookout for J. D. His cavalry escort is dissolved and he a fugitive, but in what direction is not known. Please assist my people in bringing a mail for the command.
