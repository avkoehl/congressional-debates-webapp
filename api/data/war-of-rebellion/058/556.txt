HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE, January 14, 1864.

Brigadier General W. T. WOFFORD,Commanding Division:

The commanding general will make a movement to-morrow against the enemy, and for this purpose Ransom's and Kershaw's divisions have been ordered to move for Morristown at daylight in the morning, and Jenkins is under orders to hold himself in readiness for co-operation with you. The commanding general desires, therefore, that you will move out early on the road indicated by your remarks, and send notice to General Jenkins, if the position or movement of the enemy should make it necessary for him to follow you at once. It will be necessary also for you to keep yourself in constant communication with General Martin, and your movement should be left in front.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major Huger's batteries are also under orders to move to Morristown and report to you. The general does not wish you to move out more than 3 miles down the road before he joins you, which will be early. You ought to have three days' rations with you.

MERIDIAN, January 14, 1864.

General FORREST,

Grenada:

General Pillow proposes to me, if I and General Johnston will consent to it, to take charge of two brigades, Roddey's from Johnston, and a brigade from me, and to form a connecting link between my right and Johnston's left so as to protect the iron and coal fields of Alabama, and also the Government works at Talladega, Tuscaloosa, and Selma.

I am disposed to think well of the proposition. His center would be about Tuscumbia. Could you not get up a brigade under your brother and spare it for such a service? I think it would aid my department and be a good force on your right flank. It would also make Roddey more useful. Answer.

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.
