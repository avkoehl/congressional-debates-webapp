The schooners with the reserve ammunition aboard may be towed up. Let us find the transports off that point ready to be landed when the army gets there. You will also cause all means of transportation belonging to the army, in the field and still at Fort Gaines or Navy Cove, to be shipped aboard steam-boats at once and to follow the above convoy.

I am, colonel, with respect, your most obedient servant,
