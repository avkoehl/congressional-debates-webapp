HARRISBURG, PA., June 30, 1863.

Major General JOHN E. WOOL, New York.

It is essentially necessary that General Couch have to-morrow some artillery, but he has no artillerists. We have guns and ammunition here. In the emergency, and under the authority of the Secretary of War, I direct that you send the two companies at Fort Hamilton to this place. Send them by the Easton and Allentown route from Elizabethtown point. The steamer from Fort Hamilton can deliver them there direct. By order of the Secretary of War:

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

PITTSBURGH, June 30, 1863.

(Received 11. 45 a. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I would like more instructions in regard to the three-months' men called out by the Governor. Is the Quartermaster's Department to furnish the transportation, or the mustering and disbursing officer for collecting and enrolling volunteers? No instructions have been received by the quartermaster here about the clothing. Will these troops be mustered into the United States service? Will the arms now here be issued to them?

W. T. H. BROOKS,

Major-General.

PITTSBURGH, June 30, 1863.

(Received 2. 30 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Captain [John] Carlin has arrived at Wheeling with part of his company of artillery, and makes requisition for guns. If he can be retained in this department, good use can be made of him. The Twenty-seventh New Jersey was ordered home on the 27th, unwilling to remain longer.

W. T. H. BROOKS,

Major-General.

PHILADELPHIA, June 30, 1863.

(Received 3. 05 p. m.)

His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

In my judgment, it is essential that McClellan be placed in charge of the forces in Pennsylvania not now attached to the Army of the Potomac. I speak as a friend.

J. EDGAR THOMSON.
