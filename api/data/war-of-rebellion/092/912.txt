Lieutenant-General HARDEE:

I am moving toward Walker's Bridge to intercept enemy if they move toward Augusta. Have left scouts to see if they move toward Savannah. Enemy's infantry encamped last night on Sparta road to Augusta, and also on Sparta road to Savannah. It is impossible to tell which direction they will go until it is known what march is made to-day.

Major-General.
