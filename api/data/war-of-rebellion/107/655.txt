The accompanying map* will indicate two of the places to be examined. I am unable to define the precise locality of Doctor Wormley's Ferry, but it can doubtless readily be ascertained from some inhabitant of the neighborhood.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I have ordered a regiment of horse from the rear to the front.
