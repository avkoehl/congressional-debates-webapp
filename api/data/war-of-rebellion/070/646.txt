HARPER'S FERRY, June 17, 1864.

Major. T. A. MEYSENBURG, Assistant Adjutant- General:

The Sixth West Virginia Cavalry will move as ordered. There are detachments of this regiment at Duffield's and Kearneysville, about fifty men at each place. How shall I relieve them! There are only 108 men of the Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry equipped present for duty. Answer immediately.

MAX WEBER,

Brigadier- General.

MARTINSBURG, June 17, 1864.

Brigadier- General WEBER:

The commanding general desires you to retain the two detachments on the railroad until they can be relieved by the Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry. When will the Twelfth Pennsylvania be equipped, and what is wanting!

T. A. MEYSENBURG,

Assistant Adjutant- General.

HARPER'S FERRY, June 17, 1864.

Major T. A. MEYSENBURG:

It is highly important that I get arms for the Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry without delay to clear Loundoun County of guerrillas. The rebels, in squads of thirty and forty, are making demonstrations between here and Point of Rocks continually. They tried to cross at Berlin last night, but were driven back. I have just received a report from Point of Rock about their plundering, stealing, and burning the house, barns, and hay of a Mr. Williams, living near Waterford. As soon as I have the particulars I will retaliate.

MAX WEBER,

Brigadier- General.

POINT OF ROCKS, June 17, 1864.

Brigadier- General WEBER:

The rebels, seventy- five in number, are in the neighborhood of Waterford. They have burned the house and barn of Sidney Williams. Shall we move our forces to intercept them! Can Captain D. M. Keyes go over with the infantry! Answer soon.

R. C. BAMFORD,

Captain.
