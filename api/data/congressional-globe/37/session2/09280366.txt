assessors of each collection district, respectively,
shalU immediately after the expiration of the time
for hearing appeals, and, from time to time, as
duties, taxes, or licenses become liable to be as-
sessed, make out lists containing the sums pay-
able according to the provisions of this act upon
every object of duty or taxation in and for each
collection, district, which lists shall contain the
name of each person residing within the said dis-
trict, owning or having the care or superintend-
ence of property lying within the said district
which is liable to the said tax, or engaged in any
business or pursuit requiring a license, when such
person or persons are known, together with the
sums payable by each; and where there is any
property within any collection district liable to
the payment of the said duty or tax, not owned
or occupied by or under the superintendence of
any person resident therein, there shall bo a sep-
arate list of such property, specifying the sum
payable, and the names of the respective propri-
etors, where known. And the assistant assessor
making out any such separate list shall transmit
therefrom to the assistant assessor where the per-
sons liable to pay such tax reside or shall have
their principal place of business, copies of the list
of property held by persons so liable to pay such
tax, to the end that the taxes assessed under the
provisions of this act may be paid within the col-
lection' district where the persons liable to pay the
same reside or may have their principal place of
business. And in all other cases the said assessor
shall furnish to the collectors of the several col-
lection districts, respectively, within ten days
after the time of hearing appeals, and from time
to time thereafter as required, a certified copy of
such list or lists for their proper collection dis-
tricts; and in default of performance of the duties
enjoined upon assessors by this section they shall
severally and individually forfeit and pay the sum
of five hundred dollars to the use of the United
States, and, moreover, shall forfeit their compen-
sation as assessors: Provided, That it shall be in
the power of the Commissioner of Internal Rev-
enue to exonerate any assessor as aforesaid from
such forfeitures, in whole or in part, as to him
shall appear just and equitable.
Sec. 17. And be it further enacted, That there
shall be allowed and paid to the several assessors
and assistant assessors, for their services under
this act, to each assessor three dollars per day for
every day employed in making the necessary ar-
rangements and giving the necessary instructions
to the assistant assessors for the valuation; and
five dollars per day for every day employed in
hearing appeals, revising valuations, and making
out lists agreeably to the provisions of this act;
and one dollar for every hundred taxable persons'
contained in the tax list, as delivered by him to
said collectors, and forwarded to the Commis-
sioner of Internal Revenue; to each assistant as-
sessor three dollars for every day actually em-
ployed in collecting lists and making valuations,
the number of days necessary for that purpose to
be certified by the assessor and approved by the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue; and one dol-
lar for every hundred taxable persons contained
in the tax list, as completed and delivered by him
to the assessor. And the said assessors and as-
sistant assessors, respectively, shall also be al-
lowed their necessary and reasonable charges for
stationery and blank-books used in the execution
of their duties, and the compensation herein spe-
cified shall be in full for all expenses not other-
wise particularly authorized: Provided, The Sec-
retary of theTreaaury shall be, and he is hereby,
authorized to fix such additional rates of compen-
sation to be made to assessors and assistant as-
sessors in the States of California and Oregon and
the. Territories as may appear to him to be iust<
and equitable in consequence of the greater cost
of living and traveling in those States and Terri-
tories, and as may,in his judgment, be necessary
to secure the services of competent and efficient
men, provided the rates of compensation thus al-
lowed shall not exceed the rates paid to similar
officers in such States and Territories respect-
ively. In cases where a collection district em-
braces more than a single congressional district
the Secretary of the Treasury may allow the as-
sessor such compensation as he may deem neces-
sary.
Sec. 18. And be it further enacted, That each
collector, on receiving a list, as aforesaid, and
from time to time as such lists may be received

shall be delivered by him to, and shall remain
with, the assessor of his collection district, and
shall be open to the inspection of any person who
may apply to inspect the same; and the other two
receipts shall be given on aggregate statements of
the lists aforesaid, exhibiting the gross amount
of taxes to be collected in his collection district,
one of which aggregate statements and receipts

ternal Revenue, and the other to the First Comp-
troller of the Treasury; and all lists received from
