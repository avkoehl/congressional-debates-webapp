CITY POINT, August 11, 1864.

Lieutenant DAVENPORT,

General Butler's Staff:

A negro who left Richmond Monday says that on Sunday morning Fitzhugh Lee's division of cavalry came through Richmond from toward Petersburg and passed out on the Brook turnpike; that they were more than an hour in passing, and the white folks said they were going to re-enforce Early. He also thinks that trains were sent up on the Central Railroad on Saturday and Sunday with infantry. What he knows about the infantry is very indistinct, but he states the story about the cavalry with many circumstantial facts.
