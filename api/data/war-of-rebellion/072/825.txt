The first gun of campaign was fired near Tunnel Hill May 7, at 11 a.m., by Battery I, Second Illinois. The batteries of the corps have, with two exceptions, been fought as the corps was fought previous to the 1st of September - that is, by detail, a battery or a battalion at a time - and to give a history of their marches and engagements would be merely to duplicate the reports of the several battery commanders herewith transmitted. The only occasions when the entire artillery force of the Fourteenth Corps was engaged at the same time were in front of Kenesaw Mountain, from the 20th of June to the 2nd day of July, and in the bombardment of the enemy's works around Atlanta, from the 23rd of July to the 26th of August. On the 30th day of June two guns each from the Seventh Indiana, Nineteenth Indiana, and Battery I, First Ohio, were turned over in obedience to orders from department headquarters, making the three batteries above named 4-gun batteries. On the 15th to 20th of July the Parrott guns of Batteries C, First Illinois; I, Second Illinois, and Seventh Indiana, were exchanged, in obedience of orders from the Ordnance Department, for 3-inch regulation rifles. On the 24th of July, in obedience to orders from department headquarters, the batteries of the Fourteenth Corps were withdrawn from the divisions and made a separate command under the corps chief of artillery, subject to the direction of the corps commander and department chief of artillery. In pursuance to another paragraph of the same order, Captain Drury reported to me for duty,and Captain Estep was appointed ordnance officer, assuming charge of the corps artillery ammunition train.

On the 14th of August Battery I, First Ohio, was relieved from duty in this corps by the Twentieth Indiana Battery, Captain Milton A. Osborne. It is impossible therefore to obtain the report of Captain Hubert Dilger, commanding Battery I, First Ohio, to transmit with those of the other battery commanders. I take pleasure in this connection in bearing testimony to the gallantry and spirit of Captain Dilger and to the uniform good conduct and efficiency of his command. On the 27th of August the batteries of the corps were reorganized into three battalions by order of General J. C. Davis. The following is the present organization: First Battalion, Battery C, First Illinois and Nineteenth Indiana, Captain M. H. Prescott, chief of artillery; Second Battalion, Fifth Wisconsin Battery and Battery I, Second Illinois, Captain Charles M. Barnett, chief of artillery; Third Battalion, Seventh Indiana Battery, Captain M. A. Osborne, chief of artillery. The last shot of the campaign was fired at 4 p.m. September 6, by Battery C, First Illinois. Below find report of ammunition expended from May 7, 11 a.m., to September 5, 4 p.m.:

The conduct of the officers and men of the several batteries of my command has been such as to meet my warmest approbation. Neither of the batteries had failed to silence the guns of the enemy when confronting them at any distance within easy range, and they
