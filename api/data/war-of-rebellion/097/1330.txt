Major General G. W. C. LEE,Commanding Division:

Your communication of the 9th instant, respecting the lighting up of the face of your line in the event of a night attack, has remained unanswered until now in consequence of the absence of our headquarters. General Longstreet desires that you make arrangements for that purpose. You had best communicate with General Alexander, chief of artillery, on the subject and proceed to work in co-operation with him.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
