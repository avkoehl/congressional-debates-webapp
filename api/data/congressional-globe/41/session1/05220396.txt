to report back the bill (H. R. No. 138) in re-
lation to the transportation of United State3
mails by railroad companies for present action.
Mr. SCOFIELD. I reserve objection until
it is reported.
The bill provides that it shall be lawful for
the Postmaster General to allow any railroad
â€¢ company furnishing postal or post office ears
for the transportation of the mail such addi-
tional compensation as he may think fit, not
exceeding, however, one huudred per cent,
of the rates now allowed by law.
Mr. WOOD. 1 object.
Mr. TWICHELL. I hope the gentleman
will withdraw the objection. There is no city
in the Union more interested than his own.
Mr. WOOD. I cannot see why so large a
discretion should be given to the Postmaster
General.

of service in the Army as residence required under
the homestead act. so that whatever tiin-i a, soldier
may have served in the Army shall be counted as
part of the five years' residence required by that act;
and that they report by bill or otherwise.
Mr. MAYNARD. If the gentleman will
put his resolution in the form of calling the
attention of the committee to this subject and
letting them inquire into it, I will not object.
Mr. PERRY. It is in that form now. It
is not mandatory.
Mr. MAYNARD. Then I do not object.

prepayment 01? interest.
Mr. SCHENCK. I ask that the Committee
of Ways and Means be discharged from the
further consideration of the bill (S. No. 191)
to authorize the prepayment of the interest of
the public debt.
Mr. GARFIELD. I would like to ask the
gentleman one question. The purpose of that
bill seems to me a very wise one, and I had an
impression that it was already provided for by
law ; but the fact that this bill was passed by
the Senate seemed to indicate that I was prob-
ably mistaken, and that there is no law for it.
I would like to ask the chairman of the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means why he asks us not
to legislate upon the subject?
Mr. SCHENCK. The gentleman was right
in his impression. There is upon the statute-
book, in a joint resolution passed March 17,
1864, full provision for this matter of paying
in advance the interest upon the public debt.
After that discovery was made I addressed a
note to the Secretary of the Treasury, asking
him whether he still thought further legislation
was necassaty. I ask the Clerk to read the
reply of the Secretary of the Treasury.
The Clerk read as follows :
Treasury Department, March 25.1SG9.
Sir: In reply to your note,of this date, I ha\e the
! honor to say that the joint resolution of March IT,
I 180i, appears to furnish all 'he authoiity needed tor
| the prepayment ot the interest on the public debt. I
j directed an examination to be made of the laws upon
| the subject, but the person charged with the duty
J overlooked tho joint resolution to which you call my
; attention.
| Your most obedient servant,
(jeorgb s. botjtwell,
Secretary of the Treasury.
Hon. robert c. schenck, llowse of Rep rfmetitcitivei.
Mr. GARFIELD. I would like to ask my
colleague [Mr. Schexick] if the Committee of
Ways and Means have examined, and if not,
if he has any information as to the amount of
gold which can be used in anticipation of this
interest 'I I hope the Committee of Ways and
Means and this House are in favor of the Sec-
retary doing that which this provides for.
Mr. SCHENCK. It is impossible to say at
this time how much gold can be applied to that
purpose. There is now accumulated about
eighty million dollars of coin in the Treasury,
and there will be more to be obtained hereafter
from customs. I therefore move that the bill
be laid on the table.
Accordingly the Committee of Ways and
Means were discharged from the further con-
sideration of the bill, and the same was laid
on the table.
