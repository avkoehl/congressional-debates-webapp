quarters of the Second Brigade, Third Cavalry Division. They left their brigade on the west side of the Norfolk railroad, about four miles from Petersburg. They are unintelligent and possess no information. They state that Hampton's division of cavalry is somewhere in the vicinity of their division, but cannot locate it.

They know of no movements in Lee's army. Two contrabands brought in with them left Petersburg yesterday morning. They came down the railroad as far as Reams' Station, and came into our lines from that point. They know of no troops having been sent away from Petersburg. They possess no military information.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers C. BABCOCK.

Mr. BABCOCK:

It is stated these deserters left their brigade west of "the Norfolk railroad, about four miles from Petersburg." Is not the Weldon railroad meant?

A. A. H.,

Major-General.

[Second indorsement.]

GENERAL: The stenographer made a mistake in copying. It is the Norfolk [Weldon] railroad.

Respectfully,

J. C. BABCOCK.

From deserters received to-day we can learn of no movements whatever in Lee's army. I do not believe Hill's corps has left the trenches at all. Other party not in.
