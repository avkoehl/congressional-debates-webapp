whether the fishermen knew they were entitled to
specie or i.ot, it was equally the duty of the officer
to refrain from offering these bills Mr W there-
fore, wished to know by what authority Govern-
ment, or the officeis of Government, dispensed with
the law? By what authority tney repealed the sta-
tus, or disregarded it' By what license they had
obtained the dispensing power?
It is (said Mr W ) a notorious fact that no bank
piper was, in the present state of th  curreacy,
equivalent to specie, it was refused by the Govern
ment, who demanded and obtained specie, or Trea-
sury notes, for debts due to itself How, then,
could the collector of Boston be justified in passing
bad monev as a iulfilmentofoneof the most sacred
duties of the Government, namely, the payment of
the pensions of the aged and destitute Revelut ona-
r)  pensioners?
It is said (though Mr W did not himself know
the fa^t to be so) that there was a large amount oí
Unite Í States money in that bank This was also
a subject on which Mr W w a  desirous that some
mfoimation should be given to the Senate, for he
had heretofore understood that the public money had
all, or nearly all, been drawn out of the bank Mr
W wished to know when, and by whom, ihis sum,
now understood to be there, was deposited, or how
it came there
Mr W did not wish to anticipate debate on the
Ti isury system bill which was to be brought tor-
il i d a fortmght hence, but he would, neverthe'ess,
mike a remaik or two upon two points wh rh he
in shed, as being important truths, might be kept
in the constant view of Congress and the country
Ti e first was, that every notion and idea f>f jus-
tice ¡equired tint there should be one mode of pay-
ment by the United States to all who were entitled
to payments from Government or i«s officers
There was, at present, no uniform medium Even
the Treasury notes, which were issued to public
creditors, were not all of equal value Some ol
them carried interest at the rate of five per cent
some at the rate of two per cent and some at the
rate of one mill per cent But an interest of one mill"
Mr W could not but consider it in the highest de-
gree derogatory to the dignity and character of any
Government, to ere te such a difference in its pay-
ments whereby the public creditor received a
more or less valuable compensation, not aceordmg
to his just demands, but according to hi* skill in
making a birgam, according to his faciliiy or diffi-
culty of being put off with a larger or smaPer
amount'
The other point which he wished now and a'-
ways tourg" was, that it was h s opinion that how-
ever dffsa ble it might be, as some imagined it, to
hive gold and s her lor Government us so long- is
there is a paper circulation in the country, it is not
possib'e, in the nature of things, that ( overnmen'
can so coi duct its transactions with thf people, or
keep itself safe, and keep them sar , while the
¿ =neral currency of the eountry is < epreciatcd or
deranged In other words, theie can be no sifety,
there can be no security nor confidence, even in
transact ons with Government, except by re'bm-
mg and res ormg the wnolecurreric, i ' he couotiy,
and establishing a general and uniform m^diun of
payment It is not possible for Governnent, u th
any practical utility, to have a sound cunency only
•or itself, there must be such a currency for the p o-
p'e and for the country generally. It will not be
possible for the Government to stand apart, and
strengthen itself, and Jake care of itself, and those
who deal with it, and secure its o.vn safety and
theirs, while it neglects to provide for the safety,
security and well-being of the whole country
He would add nothing to these remarks, further
than to say, hat in this case, and in all similar
cases, if lo<^ should turn out to have been suffered
by individuals m consequence of illegal pa} ments
made by officers of Government, or in consequence
of payments made m a depreciated medium, if the
officeis- themselves were not liable to make it good,
he, for one, should vote to make good every such
deficiency, to the utmost farthing, out of the Trea-
sury

CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
it was at the service of eveiy Senator to see and
examine it We conceive that the present mode
will be the most convenient way of submitting it to
general consideration
"Sir You will, I am satisfied, excuse the li-
ber y I take m addressing you these few lines, uV
subject being of th  utmost importance to my fel-
low-townsmen The Government have lately pa'd
to the fisherman oí this town their bounty money,
amounting to something like $20,000. Something
like $10 000 of this amount was paid in Common-
wealth Bank bills, the remaining $10,000 in bills of
other bank? Now, sir, just look at the distress
tint is likely to come upon this poor town by this
specie-paying Government of ours The Common-
wealth Bank has stopped, and §100 would not buy
a loaf of bread The Collector ot Boston was sol -
cited by a number of gentlemen of tin  ton n for
specie, or even Treasury notes No, he'd pay m
no other «ay but by a check on the Commonwealth
Bank This, sn, is a hard case for the poor fisher-
men of this town, and I am satisfied you, sir, will
do what lies m your power (if any thing can be
done) for their relief The poor widow and Revo-
lutionary soldier come in also for their part in the
distress of the town, many of them who have re-
ceived pensions have been pa'd in Commonwealth
Bank bills, and, having full reliance upon the Go
vernrnent, have kept the money they had paid them
by the Government, believing that the Government
would no' pay them in bad money
1 am, clear sir, your obedient servant "
Mr BAYARD inquired if the Senator from Mas-
sachusetts could say what particular connection
theie was, if any, between the Commonwealth
Bank and the Government, and whether the col-
lector at Boston, or any of the other officers of tne
Government, were directors of this bank, or had
any particular connection with it
Mr WEBSTER replied that, from recollection,
he should think himself justified in saying that the
local officers of the Government had, more or less,
been connected with the bank for a great while
He did not know that the collector was a director,
but he believed the deputy collector was one of the
diiectors, he was so recently, and the distiict at-
torney was also one of the directors This bank
was selected eaily as a depository of the public
money. The gentlemen connected with it were
very íesreclable, and very much distinguished for
their political attachment to the last and piesent
Administrations, and Mr W believed they weie
among tne frst who appealed here against the re-
new ai of the charter of the late Bank of the United
Slate , and gentlemen connected with the bank
had not a ht'fe to do with the removal of the de
posites from the Bank of the United States This,
ho i e\ ei, Mr W said from recolleclion
Mr HUB BIRD said that he had no objections
whatever to the adoption ot the resolution offered
bi iht. Senator fiom Massachusetls, and if the Sena-
tor had presented his reso'ution unaccompanied wuh
any remark, he should not have unsealed his hps
unon the subject, but as that gentleman had seen fit
to submit his views somewhat at large, not only with
reference to the pailicular transaction m Boston,
bjt generally upon the subject of the currency, he
must ast tne indulgence of the Senate in saying a
word or two m answer Beiore proceeding, how-
ever, he would wish to learn distinctly fiom that
Senato- M>hether he stated, or intended to be so
understood, that the faecretaij oí the Treasury had
given any authority, direcih ot indirectly, to any
pabhc officer, to pay any of the public cred'tors in
any currency not expressly wairarted by the aci
of Congress'! whethei the Senator intended to be
understood by lus remarks that the Secretary of
the Treas íry had any ki owlrdge of, or any con-
cern with, ihe transió ion m Boston' whether that
transaction were, or were not, cen urable1! whether
it were, or were not, in vio'ation of law1 He
would not wish to proceed before he received from
the Senator an answer to these inquiries
Mr WEBSTER replied that he had designed to
intimate nothing on this point He did not know,
and had, therefore, proposed this inquiry. It was,
however, an important duty, (paying bounties and
pensions,) and either was, or ought to be, directed
by the superior of those who did it.   But what-
I                                                            .....        ........ft    ^      IN                        .....,11.........■   ■■——
ever the Secretary of the Treasury had determined,
that the law should be broken, or whether he knew
it was broken, or whether it was done by his deter-
mination,"Mr W did not know, and gave no opi-
nion But if he might avail himse f of the charac-
teristic privilege of that community, and guess a
ultle, he would conjecture ¿hat the honorable mem-
ber from New Hampshire was already informed
on this point, and Mr. W was inelmed to inquire
whedier it were not so. Mr W would also in-
quire whether there had not been, since May,
1837, hundreds of instances of the payment of mo-
ney, not by the Secretary, but by his subordinate
officers, in bank notes. Whether taey had been
made with the knowledge of the Secretary, Mr.
W did not know , but he knew the fact that his
constituents had been so paid
Mr HUBBARD remarked that the Senator was
t ully entitled 10 ihe character of a Yankee He
had answered h's inquiries by submitting to him
other questions
The Senator asked him whether he had not heard
the Secretary of the Treasury speak o"f this affair
in Boston, and that the facts were avithin his know-
ledge , and h hether ihere 1-ad not been since May,
1837, payments made to the public creditors in
bank notes m numerous instances, and wheiher
theje things had not been done with the sanction of
th« Secretary , and whether he had not understood
the matter from the Secretaiy himself He wished
not to evade the questions. He would most cheer-
fully and directly answer (he gentleman's interro-
gatories. He hui never received from the Secreto  y of
the Tí easury any such information
The gentleman is answered, aid answered truly,
and, whatever might be the feeling of the Senator
himself, such was his own confidence in the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, that he would not for a single
moment indulge the thought that he would connive
at any violation of official duty in any public offi-
cer, or in any disregard vby any such officer) of
the express piovisions of the law The Secretary
of the Treasury could be guilty of no such breach
of the public trust, and the Senator would not
presume to make such a charg  against him.
The Secretary, s0 far from giving any authority to
pay any of the public creditors in the paper ofany
bank since May last, that it had been his unceas-
ing effort to dissolve all connection with the local
banks, and to be prepared to receive and disburse
m an entirely different currency.
An inquiry had been made, who were the direc-
tors and who were the stockholders of the Com-
monwealth Bank' He coqld not state from his
own know'ed?e who were the 'directors or who
were the swkrtoiders He lived íemote from the
place where the bank was located, and had re er
had any coneen whatever «ifh the institution,
but there was not a Senatoi on this floor who was
better informed on this poim than the Senator from
Mass, chusetts, but he was ver/ certain that the
collecto- « as not, and le ver had been, a director ot
that bank, and whether he was, or was not, a
stockholder he was unable to say
He had said that he should interposa no objec-
tion to the passage of the resolution It tie object
be to set facts be it so, but the Senator has very
plainly in ¡mated, not only that the co'lecior has,
without law and against everv in >ral s=nse, paid
these cieditors >n the bills of the Commonwealth
Bank, but has insinuated that this was done by
trie authority—certainly w ith the kno vledge—of
the Secretary himself He had no dpubt that if
the Senator entertained any such suspicion, that
he wojld find himself egregiouslj mistaken He
ven'ured to predict, that the Scere arj of the Tiea-
sury had never ac'ed so regardless of his high
tiust, as to give directions to an subordinate offi-
cer to pay the public creditors in a depreciated cur-
rency, and he also bel eved that the subordinate
officer referred to had, on no occasion, acted so re-
gardless of Ins official duty, and of pt,bl c law, as
to offer any such depreci„ted cwency, without
right, to satisfy the claims, of public creJit^is jf
the fact should be otherwise, he would not be be 
hmd the gentleman from Massachusetts in expres-
sing his strongest disapprobation.
The Senator from Massachusetts had contended
that it was a direct etfiartial violation of the act of
