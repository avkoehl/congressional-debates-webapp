DECEMBER 26, 1862.-Capture of guerrilla camp in Powell County, Kentucky.

Report of Major-General Horatio G. Wright, U. S. Army, commanding Department of the Ohio.

CINCINNATI, OHIO,

January 2, 1863-12.15 p.m.

I have just learned from Major-General Granger that Major Stivers, of the Fourteenth Kentucky Cavalry, with 150 men, who were ordered by him upon a scout, to ascertain the whereabouts of a large band of guerrillas in the eastern part of Powell County, Kentucky, on the 26th ultimo, after traveling all night, over obscure and dangerous bridle-paths, came upon their camp as they were preparing to move, dashed upon them, capturing their leader, a noted guerrilla, and 11 men. The rest, though outnumbering Major Stivers' force, were utterly routed, and escaped into the dense brush and mountain gorges. Twenty-five horses and a large amount of clothing, blankets, guns, pistols, &amp;c., that were being transported to Humphrey Marshall's camp, were also captured.
