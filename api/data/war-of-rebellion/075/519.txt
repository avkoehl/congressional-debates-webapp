but the place is still held by the enemy. Major Morton, of the Engineers, formerly a brigadier, was killed at Petersburg. The rebel report of a disaster to Sheridan near Gordonsville was not true. He has returned, having whipped the enemy on the 12th, but was unable to carry Gordonsville because of large infantry re-enforcements. Nothing recent from Hunter.

Enemy gave way last night in the midst of darkness and storm, and at daylight our pickets entered his line from right to left. The whole army is now in pursuit as far as chattahoochee. I start at once at Marietta, and leave orders for railroad and telegraph to be kept up.

We have pressed him pretty close to-day, although the continued rain makes all movements almost an impossibility.
