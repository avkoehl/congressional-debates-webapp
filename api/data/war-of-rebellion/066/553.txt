CHARLESTON, S. C., July 3, 1864.

Brigadier General W. B. TALIAFERRO,

Royall's House, James Island, S. C.:

IF there is anything like the disparity of numbers you mention, don't attack. I will ride over and see you late in the day after I have fuller accounts from General Robertson of aspect of affairs in his district. How far is the enemy's line of battle from your heavy batteries? Can you see them distinctly? Are they at work intrenching? Do they seem to have been intrenching during the night?

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 3, 1864.

Brigadier General W. B. TALIAFERRO,

Royall's House, James Island, S. C.:

Keep all men you have until further orders. I intended to go over to-day, but as the enemy has fallen back I shall not do so unless something occurs making it advisable. Two of my staff will go down. The David will go down to-night as you desire. Flag-Officer Tucker has been asked to send men to Fort Johnson. General Robertson telegraphs that enemy landed at White Point, advanced at King's Creek, where they were met and after a fight of two hours fell back; our loss very small. I really think morning.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 3, 1864.

Colonel J. A. YATES,

Fort Johnson:

What force have you effective at Johnson and Haskell? Has naval reserves reported to you?

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CONFEDERATE SIGNAL MESSAGES.*

Enemy assaulted us at daylight. Came almost up to our quarters. We drove them back with a few men, capturing 200 prisoners and 1 colonel, 2 officers, and 1 signal corps.

S.

I have made a fine watch, lot of greenbacks, and a lot of other things too numerous to mention.
