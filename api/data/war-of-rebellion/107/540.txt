General G. B. MCCLELLAN,

Harper's Ferry:

Colonel Colburn's dispatch, 4 p. m., just received. Orders have ben given to all commanders of divisions to hold themselves ready to move at short notice, Generals McCall and Smith to have three days' cooked rations in haversacks. General Porter will be ready if wanted. I have just seen Garrett. He says you had better send back the train used for General Banks' command as soon as it is no longer wanted, as it will be required. he has just left for Baltimore, and I have instructed him to have everything ready if called upon. Nothing new from any other quarter. I am glad the bridge answers so good a purpose.

R. B. MARCY.

General F. J. PORTER,

Hall's Hill, Va.:

I have just heard from the general. I do not think it at all imorbable that he may call upon you to move at short notice to-night or in the morning; therefore, it would be well for you to be ready. The bridge is completed and works well. Keep your telegraph open until 1 o'clock to-night.

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.
