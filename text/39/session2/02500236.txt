Remarks.—-Tho amounts paid deputy collectors
come out of the salary of tlie principal coUeotor.
*This mark denotes the districts the reports for
whloh ate not on file in this office.
Bnt let us begin the work of retrenchment in
this Capitol. The recent increase of salary is
not justified by the condition of the country or
the judgment of those we represent. Prices
are not now so high as during the war, when
gold for a considerable period was at a much
larger premium than now. No man then urged
an increase of salary, though the necessity for
it then was greater than now. If it be said the
war was then upon us, requiring sacrifices alike
of Congress and the people, I answer, the bur-
dens of the war are yet upon us in the shape
of a national debt of $2,700,000,000, with State
liabilities besides, and obligations yet unper-
formed to the soldiers whose valor and perse-
verance saved the Republic in the hour of its
greatest peril. Let us first be just before we
are generous dispensers of the Treasury, of
which we have been made the guardians if not
the custodians.
If the policy of this Administration, as ad-
vanced in the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, should be speedily carried out, it
would be impossible for the people to endure
the taxation which they now so patiently bear,
while they are permitted to share the benefits
of a currency of " United States notes," or as
they are generally called, "greenbacks," of
8385,441,849, in addition to national bank notes,
$292,671,753.
The report informs us that—
"The Secretary is of the opinion that the national
banks should be sustained, and that the paper cir-
culation of the country should be reduced, not by
compelling them to retire their notes, but by the
■withdrawal of the United States notes"—
the "greenbacksand the Secretary reminds
us of—
" the discredit which attaches to the Government by
failing to pay. the notes according to their tenor."
If more than half of the best currency the
people ever had, or can have, should be sud-
denly withdrawn, our national funded debt
would necessarily be augmented to an equal
amount, adding more than $20,000,000 to its
interest, and consequently to our taxes, and
what is of vastly more consequence, commer-
cial revulsion and bankruptcy must inevitably
follow. A general reduction in the prices of
produce, the wages of the laborer and the me-
chanic would_ speedily follow, diminishing the
means of liquidating taxes and the public debt,
but at the same time increasing comparatively
the load of the debt itself.
I cannot indorse that financial policy that
would increase our burdens while diminishing
the means of discharging them; yet the fact
that this policy is urged, as the Secretary of
the Treasury distinctly says, to secure lower
prices generally, should admonish us that this
is no time to enlarge salaries or expenses. It
is not correct to charge upon the Government
the discredit"' '"of failing to pay its notes."
We learn from the report of the Secretary
of the Treasury that the receipts and expendi-
tures of the Government for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1866, were as follows:
Balance in Treasury, agreeable to warrants, July 1,
1865-   $858,309

1st day of October last was S142.418.78&.
Here, then, in these receipts the Govern-
ment redeemed in one year every doiar of the
legal-tender "greenbacks," and again paid
them out to a people willing to receive them.
This currency is thus paid and again put in
circulation, answering aE the purposes of pld.
Unlike every other currency, it is a legal
tender for debts and in payment of taxes, and
thus has two values never imparted to any other
paper money in our previous history. And now
I have sufficiently shown that this increase of
compensation was carried through, not on its
own merits, but to secure limited bounties to
meritorious soldiers deserving much more.
It is high time that this dangerous and vieioas
practice of coupling together different and dis-
tinct measures in one bill should be forever
discarded. It secures legislation against the
matured judgment of those who are unwill-
ingly driven to give it "aid and comfort." It
furnishes an excuse for evil legislation and a
shelter from all responsibility. The evil is so
apparent and so great that in several of the
State constitutions, as in Ohio, it is expressly
provided, that—
"No bill shall contain more than one subject,
which shall be clearly expressed in its title."
And because this measure was thus passed
"we should now restore the law so as to conform
to the judgment of the House. It is not to be
presumed that the opinions twice solemnly ex-
pressed in July, before the elections, have since
been changed, or that members could entertain
one set of opinions before the elections and
another after.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr, GRINXELL obtained the floor and
said: I yield a portion of my time to the gen-
tleman from Ohio, that he may conclude his
r6iQ^rks
Mr. LAWREXCE, of Ohio. Mr. Chairman,
we owe it to the great Union or Eepublican
party of the country to restore the salary as it
was before the act of July last. The Union
party is not responsible for the increase. The
proposition for that purpose originated in the
Senate, on motion of the Senator from Dela-
ware, Mr. Kiddle, a Democrat, (Globe, page
4074.) and was adopted there by a vote as fol-
lows :
Union. (Republican,) ayes   ....,,,14

It is one of the merits of the act of July last
that it reduces mileage one half. But a still
further reduction is demanded alike by every
consideration of justice and economy.
When the act of January 22, 1818, (3 United
States Statutes, 404,) fixing mileage at forty
cents per mile was under consideration in Con-
gress, an effort was made to reduce it upon the
ground that it was comparatively higher than
the per diem of eight dollars.
