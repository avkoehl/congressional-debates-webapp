STEVENSON, October 25, 1863-2.30 p.m.

Brigadier-General GEARY,

Bridgeport:

Hold your command in readiness to march at 12 m. to-morrow. We march with three days' rations, without wagons. Will all your troops and batteries be up? If not, have word sent them not to lose a moment's time.

By looking at the map you will see that troops will save 10 miles' marching by taking a direct road to Bridgeport from Anderson, avoiding Stevenson.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.

STEVENSON, October 25, 1863-3 p.m.

Major-General HOWARD,

Bridgeport:

I am surprised to learn that you have but one reliable battery out of five. We will march to-morrow if we go without any. One battery will have to be sent, as ordered,and at once.

Rations are at Bridgeport. Your troops will be up. Have directions given for all your batteries to be put in condition for service without a moment's delay.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.

STEVENSON, October 25, 1863-5 p.m.

Major-General HOWARD,

Bridgeport:

It will not be possible to bring all the force together in season to march to-morrow. Let everything be in readiness for an early start the following morning.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.

STEVENSON, October 25, 1863-[10 p.m.]

Major-General REYNOLDS,

Chief of Staff:

All but two batteries and two regiments of the force for operations on the south side of the river are now at Bridgeport. These should be up to-morrow. My headquarters will be here after 12 to-morrow. The command assigned me will be in readiness to commence the movement sunrise of 27th. The steamer is launched and waiting a necessary piece of pipe. General Howard reports a woman coming in our lines who states Bragg's forces fallen back 30 miles, but not confirmed by other reports.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.
