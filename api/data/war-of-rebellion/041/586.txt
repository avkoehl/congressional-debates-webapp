HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,June 22, 1863.

Colonel CAHILL:

The Fifteenth Maine has just arrived, and I will send them to the La Fourche Crossing to support you at once. With this large accession of force, you can drive the enemy where you please. Hold on stoutly, and if the trains are all with you, send them back to bring up this regiment. More are coming.

By command of W. H. Emory, brigadier-general, commanding:

W. D. SMITH,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Respectfully,

W. H. EMORY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant PETER FRENCH, Aide-de-Camp, Algiers:

Go on and communicate with Colonel Cahill at La Fourche. Tell him to beat the enemy off, if he can; and, if he cannot, to do the best he can. The trains are all at his service. If you see the cavalry as you pass, hurry them forward to Boutte Station.
