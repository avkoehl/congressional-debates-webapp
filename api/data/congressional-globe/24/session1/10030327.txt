24th Cono.... 1st Sess.
Land Distribution Bill—Mr. Wright,
Senate.
or other sources separate from the lands, is also
to be distributed in the same manner, and by the
same ratio.
Is not this (Mr. W. said he would ask) the
fair operation of this bill, which purports to divide
among the States the net proceeds of the public
lands? What difference can there be whether the
whole proceeds of the public lands which reach
the Treasury are distributed as the bill proposes,
and the expenses of the lands, of their purchase,
of obtaini ng possession of them, and placing them
in a condition to be sold, be made a permanent
charge upon the Treasury, that the whole avails
of the sales may be distributed; or whether those
expenses, necessary and indispensable to acquire
the ownership of the lands, and to put them in a
marketable condition, be paid out of the proceeds
of the lands, and a proportion of the other rev-
enues, equal to those expenses, be taken for the
distribution ? It would be difficult for human in-
genuity to point out a difference to the Treasury,
to the public interests of this Government, to the
States who are to receive the dividends, and, in
his judgment, equally difficult to point out any
difference in principle between this bill having
this practical operation, and a bill upon its face
proposing to make the same distribution of the
surplus revenue generally.
Mr. W. said it was not his purpose, upon this
occasion, to discuss the constitutionality of this
bill, or of any distribution of the revenues of this
Government to the respective States, but he had
felt bound to make this suggestion for the con-
sideration and reflection of all who expected to
support this bill, and might have any scruples as
to the power of Congress to make a distribution
of the revenues generally, or of any other portions
of our revenue than those derived from the public
lands. He must believe he had shown that this
bill, if it should become a law, and should receive
the construction given to it by its friends here,
would operate to distribute millions from the
Treasury which could not, by any exhibition of
facts, or any form of reasoning, be made the
"net proceeds of the public lands," but must be
admitted to be the proceed* of revenues derived
from other sources.
He had not been' able, from any documents
before him, nor had time permitted him to ob-
tain from the proper Department the information
necessary to determine what had been the net
proceeds of the public lands for the years* 1833,
1834, and 1835; but it was enough for the pur-
pose of his argument to know, and to have shown,
that until the year 1835, and until for into that
year, the lands were, and in all former time had
been, heavily in debt to the Treasury, even
without any claim for interest upon the advances
made beyond the «urns of interest actually paid
upon the stocks issued for the parchase of Louis-
iana and Florida. There was not, therefore, in
the Treasury, prior to the latter part 'of 1835,
any such thing as "net proceeds"arising from
the sales of the publie lands; but a deficit of gross
proceeds to meet the expenses which the Treas-
ury had incurred on account of the lands. To
attempt, therefore, to take money from the Treas-
ury, which came into it from the lands' before
that period for the purpose of distribution, will
be to attempt to take money which is not there,
which had been expended before it came there;
and if money be'so taken, it will be money de-
rived from other sources of revenue, ana not
" net proceeds pf the sales of the publie lands."
It will be a distribution not of the proceeds of
the lands, but of the revenues of the Treasury
generally.
Mr. W. said he proposed, in the second place;
to attempt to show that if the proceeds of the
sales of the public lands, for the years named,
were taken from the national Treasury, and dis-
tributed to the States, that Treasury, at the pres-
provide  that the net proceeds «ball be ascertained by de-
•dnctiiu! from the grow proceeds the expenses of the General
Land Office, of the registers' and receivers' olfiees, of sur-
veys, and of the five per cent, payable to the new States;
out propositions to deduct also the purchase money paid to
the Indians for the kinds, annuities   lien of purchase-
money, the expense of treaties with the Indians for the
purchase of the lands, and the expenses of the removal of
the Indians from the lands, were expressly rejected by
deliberate votes of the Senate.
ent rates of the revenues from the customs, could
not meet the ordinary expenses of the Govern-
ment, and carry on any system of national de-
fense more vigorous or expensive than that which
had been pursued for the last twenty years.
To come to a determination upon this point,
he had examined with care the expenses of the
Government for the last nineteen years, from 1817
to 1835, both inclusive; and for the sake of brev-
ity he had averaged the expenses of each four
years for the first sixteen years of the series,
giving the averages, including the payments to-
wards the national debt, and also exclusive of
those payments. For the years 1833, 1834, and
1835, the expenses of each year are stated sepa-
rately. The results, discarding minor fractions,
are as follows:
For the years—
1817 to 1820 inclusive..
1821 to 1824     do.
1825 to 1823     do.

From the above it will be seen that the average
expenditures from 1817 to 1832, both inclusive,
separate from any payments towards the national
debt, were about thirteen millions and a half per
annum; that in 1833 they appear to have been
increased more than eight millions beyond those
of the preceding year, and nine millions beyond
the average of the sixteen previous years.
Mr. W. said he held in his hand a comparative
statement between the expenses of the years 1833
and 1834, prepared for the purpose of showing
whence arose the great difference of $4,000,000
between the expenditures, exclusive of payments
upon the debt, in those two years. The analysis
was long and tedious, and he had already wearied
the patience of the Senate with too many figures
and arithmetical calculations to trouble them with
this statement. He would merely remark, that a
very large proportion of the expenses of the
Indian war known as the Black Hawk war, were
paid in 1833; that the amount paid for pensions
in 1833 exceeded the same payments in the fol-
lowing year by more than $1,200,000, arising, as
he presumed, from the fact that the pension law
of 1832 would be likely to call heavily for pay-
ments in 1833, not only for the accruing pensions
of the year, but for arrears back to the date pre-
scribed in the act; that the expenses of Indian
treaties were $1,000,000 in 1833 more than in
1834; and that the indemnities from Denmark,
amounting to $600,000, passed through the Treas-
ury in 1833 and were paid to the claimants, and
therefore appear to swell the expenses of the
year to that extent, although the Government had,
at no time, any interest whatsoever in the money
received and disbursed. There are various other
items of expenditure, which varied, some the
one way and some' the other, in the comparison
between the two years, but the four abovenamed,
and the large amount of duties refunded in 1833,
$600,000, beyond the amount in 1834, in conse-
quence of the confiict of. the various tariff acts,
constitute the most prominent and important
causes of the very great increase in the apparent
expenses of the former year.
The expenses for 1834 and 1835 had averaged
about eighteen millions, exclusive of any pay-
ments towards the national debt. This would
be seen to be a diminution from the expenses of
1833 of about four millions, and an increase of
from three to four millions beyond the ordinary
expenses of the years mentioned prior to 1833.
He would not attempt to account for this in-
crease any further than to remark, that appro-
priations by .Congress had been, most palpably,
becoming more liberal, if not extravagant, since
the national debt was apparently rapidly ap-
proaching its fioftl extinction, and the Treasury
remained full to a fault. It was not the private
claims and private applications alone which met
with an easy success unknown in former legis-
lation, bqt public and permanent appropriation*
were increased and increasing. He would ¡in-
stance the munificent appropriations for this Dis-
trict; the late pension laws; the increase of the
pay of the Navy, and many similar taws of the
last few years. These instances were by no
means particularized as wrong in themselves or
censurable in our national legislation. No opin-
ion upon the measures are called for or intended
to be expressed; but ihe laws are referred to as
prominent instances of the character of our late
acts, carrying with them, from necessity, a ma-
terial increase of the ordinary annual expenses
of the Government. From causes of this char-
acter our ordinary expenses, for the last two
years, have averaged about eighteen millions;
and that, notwithstanding the fact that not one
cent was appropriated to the fortifications for the
last year. What, then, can be fairly assumed
as the amount of our ordinary expenses for the
future ? Will any one believe that they can fall
far short of the average of the two last years?
Must they not vary, according to the peculiar
exigencies of different years, from sixteen to
eighteen millions ? His examinations (said Mr.
W.) had satisfied him that they must, and that
$17,000,000 was as low an average as should be
contemplated, especially when we were inquiring
as to supplies for the common Treasury. He
believed a careful inspection of the expenses of
past years, and of the several laws of a late date,
making permanent appropriations, would bring
the mind of each Senator to the same conclusion
to which his had been brought by the investiga-
tions to which he had referred.
Having thus settled, as far as that could be done
by analogy and experience, the amount required
for the ordinary expenses of the Government,
(Mr. W. said,) it now became his duty to com-
pare that amount with the revenue from customs,
to enable the Senate to form a judgmentupon the
soundness or unsoundness of the proposition he
had laid down. This he had done in the same
manner in which he had examined and presented
the expenditures, and for the same years, and he
would give to the Senate, in as concise a form as
possible, the results presented by the documents.
To make the comparison more simple and perfect,
and to give it less of the dry detail of figures, he
had in this comparison, as in the statement of the
expenses, grouped periods of four years for the
first sixteen years of the examination, and would
present separately each of the last three years.
In this way the two statements might be com-
pared with each other with convenience, and
without possession of the mass of calculations
which led to the results.   The comparison follows:

The foregoing1 comparison (Mr. W. said) af-
forded the ground for several most useful infer-
ences in relation to the former policy and practices
of this Government. Some of those inferences he
must bring to the notice of the Senate and the
country, as he thought they would be useful in
all time to come.
The first which he would draw was, that in
the nineteen years last preceding the present, the
revenue from customs had exceeded the expenses
of the Government in but two years, and those
two were years when peculiar circumstances,
occasioned either by our own legislation, or by
the condition of our foreign relations, most satis-
factorily accounted for the excesses of revenue
from this source. The first was the year 1833,
when the greatest excess appeared. The high
tariff of 1828 ceased its operation on the 3d of
March in that year, but the long credits allowed
under that act necessarily extended the collections
of the customs which accrued under it over the
whole of that year. In the mean time, the tariff
act of 1833, known as the compromise act, was
