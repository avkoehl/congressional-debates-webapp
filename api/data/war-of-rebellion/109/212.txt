General McClellan wishes to talk with General Buell direct; says it will be a great help to know if we can get a direct connection; if not to-night, to-morrow at 11 a. M. Buell can cross the Ohio. Will you make the arrangement?

Major-General HUNTER,

Fort Leavenworth:

Fort Donelson and its garrison of 30,000 men are completely invested. Four times they have attempted to get out, and four times have they been driven back. Heavy loss on both sides. Our mortar-boats are slowly ascending the Cumberland, and I am straining every nerve to increase the army. Everything looks well; we shall have hard fighting very soon.
