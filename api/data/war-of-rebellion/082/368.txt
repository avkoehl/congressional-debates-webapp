Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that on the 13th instant I received orders from Lieutenant-General Grant, commanding Armies of the United States, to proceed to Baltimore with four batteries of the Sixth Corps and report to Major-General Ord. The command arrived at Baltimore on the 15th and 16th. Not finding Major-General Ord at Baltimore, I telegraphed Major-General Halleck for orders, and by his direction proceeded to Washington by rail on the evening of the 16th and reported to Major-General Augur. At 9 a. m. 17th instant I received an order from Lieutenant-General Grant to return to City Point, and embarked that night, arriving at this place on the 19th. The First Delaware Cavalry, dismounted, were assigned to this brigade for guard duty during the absence of the corps, and accompanied my command to Baltimore, where they were retained by order of Major-General Halleck. I inclose copies of the several orders which I received.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. TOMPKINS,

Major, Commanding Brigade.
