Numbers 71. Report of Bvt. Brigadier General Robert McAllister, Eleventh New Jersey Infantry, commanding Third Brigade.
HDQRS. THIRD Brigadier, THRID DIV., SECOND ARMY CORPS,April 15, 1865.

CAPTAIN: In compliance with others from division headquarters, I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this command from March 28 up to date:

Pursuant to orders the brigade broke camp on the morning of the 29th of March, and,with the rest of the division, moved to the left. Our movements on the 29th and 30th consisted in advancing our lines cautiously, the enemy's skirmishers falling back before us. On the 31st moved farther toward the left to relieve the First Division, near Boydton plank road, where the enemy was found strongly entrenched and three of their forts commanding the road. An assault on one of these having been ordered, at 12 m. the Eleventh Massachusetts Volunteers (Lieutenant Colonel C. C. Rivers), the One hundred and twentieth New York Volunteers (Lieutenant Colonel A. L. Lockwood), and the left wing of the Eighth New Jersey Volunteers (Major Hartford), supported by the Eleventh New Jersey Volunteers (Lieutenant Colonel J. Schoonover), advanced. The regiments charged through heavy slashing to the crest of the hill overlooking the enemy's works, and succeeded in driving the enemy from and occupying part of their rifle-pits, capturing some fifteen of their pickets. The attack was made under a severe fire from the enemy's batteries and a sharp musketry from the enemy's pits. After remaining there under and enfilading fire of the enemy's artillery, sweeping our entire front, for about one hour, orders were received to withdraw, which was a more difficult task than the advance. The men wee drawn off, almost one by one, under a severe fire of the enemy's sharpshooters, not, however, without the loss of many men killed, wounded, and prisoners. At dark the brigade was ordered to the left of Boydton plank road, and took up position near a run in the woods for the night.
