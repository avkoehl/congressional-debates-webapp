General H. A. WISE:

GENERAL: I send you copy of instructions from General Lee for your guidance. They are vague enough. The guarding of the obstructions is the great thing to be done. The watching of the roads can be done by cavalry, with small infantry supports. I cannot leave here or I would go down and see the wants of the position and try to have them supplies. No directions of course are needed. The dutythere is plain. It is simply to prevent the Yankees from Gaining the "Gate" to Richmond.

Yours, truly,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.

General D. H. HILL,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: Please give such orders as may be necessary to put General Wise in position to support and hold Chaffin's Bluff battery if it should be attached. He may be in such position now. If so, all that will be necessary will be to give him the order to render the necessary support at the proper time.

I remain, very respectfully,

J. LONGSTREET,

Major-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]

GENERAL: I send you the order from General Longstreet, my immediate superior. I suppose that the road can be picketed by cavalry and a small force of infantry. The attack, as I take it, will be made diretly on the batteries.

Yours, truly,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.
