CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
he believed that there was an appropriation foi nearly every
fortification in the State    Here they were
"For completing repairs oí *oit Niagara, and erecting and
repanü\g necessary buildings therein, New York, twenty
«MKWiaad dollars,
' For completing reptirs of Fort Ontario, Oswego, New
York, and erecting neee&aary buildings therein, fifteen thou
sand dollars,
"For Fort Schuyler, New York harbor, seventy thousand
dollars,
"For repairs of Fort Wood and sea wall, Bed'ow   island,
New York harbor, fifty thousand dollars,
"For permanent walls for Fort Columbia, Castle William,
and South battery, Governoi5  island, New Yoik harbor, twelve
thousand dollars,
"For repairs of sea wall of Castle William and other partt, of
Governor's island, seven thousand dollars "
Making m all 174j000 dollars—about one fifth of the sum
appropriated to all the other Slates of the Union Nor had
the chairman of the committee, said Mr B been unmindful ol
his own immedate district, foi he had provided for the pnnci
pal fortification m the State of New York on the lakes, white
there was not a single dollar apptopuated to any lomfication on
any other part of the lake fiontiei With the exception of
these forts, in the chairman's owd district, u wa-, truly, as was
said by the gentleman from Kentucky [Mi Underwood! a
salt water appropriation bill, and he Mr B presumed the rea
son why Fort Déla ware had fared so badly, was that the watei
at the Pea Patch was only brackish
The chairman, said Mi B was not the only one on the com
mittee who had provided for his own household—the three
gentlemen from Virginia had also got a goodly share Here
they were
"For repairs of Fort Washington, Potomac nur, thirty five
thousand dollars,
"ForFortMonioe Old Point Comfoit,Virginia onehundred
and fifteen thousand dollars "
The gentleman fioni Vugmia [Mi Wise] shakes his head,
but he Mr B could tell him, though Tort Washing ion was on
the Maryland side of the Potomac it was as much i Virginia
fortress as a Maryland one—-n was to pio*ect Alexandria, and
that city w is always considered Virginian But Mr B said
he had no objections to all these appropriations, they were
probably all necessary—he only brought them before the com
mittee to induce them to do a little of thatjustlce to the States
of Pennsylania, Delaware, and New Jersey, that had bean
done, by the Committee of Ways and Means so liberally to
other States
He would again revert to what he said yesterday, that he
could not vote for any bill that did not contain a provision for
the defences of the Delaware \t present the whole coast
would fare alike, and the enemy, if one we were to have, might
seleuhisown place ioi landing unmolested, but if the whole
coast, with the exception of the Helawaie, was to be armed and
the bristling cannon met that tnemy at every othei place, he
would be foiced into the Delaware, t> plunder andpiey upon
those who inhabit Us shores Although the people in that
tmaiter of the United States havu been reí used my paituip-i
tion m the Executive councda, 01 m the committees ol the
House, he trusted that the representatives of the people would
not therefoie consider them unwoithy the protection of* the Go
vernment, and give them over unarmed to the common enemy
Mr WA.TTERSON having obtained the floor, was about to
reply to the speech of Mr Mason, made yesterday, when
The CHAIR pronounced him out of oidei
Mr WATTERSON, to obtain a wider range of remark,
moved to amend the bill by striking out the enicung chuse a
motion which, according to the i ules of the House, throws oY en
every subject connected with a bill to fue debate Mr W
thenwemonm some lemarks, which will be hereafter given
in the Appendix
Mr WISE had not risen to discuss the war question, butsim
ply to get House back to the eonsi lciation of the bill
Mr W then went into a statistical document >\ iting the
amount of unexpended appiopnations for 1840 and 1841
Mr FILLMORE refei re I toa ie<em tommunicatK n iiom
the Engineer Department sutin^ wh it pi iportion of the^e ap
propnations had been expended duung the present reason and
which, as far as the return^ had been received amounted to
about ©90 000
Mr WISE insisted that admit'ing this, anddednctmg it fiom
the unexpenled balance, the Department must have about
0700,000 at its disposal
Mr JONES went into some statistical statements to show
that the amount available must be much larger than this He
came to the conclusion that in Tebruary last it wa& over a mil
lion
Mr FILLMORE further explained as to the mannei in
which the money had been applied, stating that very httie had
been done in 1840, owing to the suspension by the President of
the sums appropriated
Mr WISE resumed and taking the amount at seven hun
dred thousand dolíais at the commencement of the season, ob
served that the prespnt bill asked for a million and nmeuen
thousand dollars, and mqu red of Mr Pillmore how
so large a sum could propeily b- expended withm the present
year
Mr FILLMORE was understood to state m rpply that the
money would not all be exp nded this year, but that a pait
woula be used m the earlv poitionof 1842, before the ippro
pnation bill for that year should pass
Mr WIS i j remonstrated against ttn*> coui^e and insisted
that the appropriation of each year ought to rrovide for that
year only He went into a statement to ¡ huw that from the
year 1829 to 1840 the average amount appi ipm ed for foru
fications had been ©762 000 a year and the avei age expenditure
had been $866 0@0 When Mr Benton's mammoth Jortifica
tion bill had been reported m 1836 as a counterblast to the disti i
butionbill, even that, with all its extiava^ance, did not propose
so large an annual average of expenditure as would he created
by the passage of the present bill
The great argument against >Tr Benton's hill—an argument,
toe, which had been again urged by the present Secretary of
War, then m the House, was, that the money could not be ex
pended. This was the argument Mr W insisted on against
the present bill, n appropriated mere money than could heap
plied within the year Besides, when Mr Benton's bill had
been proposed there had been a surplus of forty two millions
10 the Treasuiy, whereas now instead of a surplus the Go
vernment abked for a loan of twelve millions
To that pan of the bill which appropriated money for the
payment of the Georgia and Florida militia, Mi W should
make no opposition, but he could not vote these large sums for
fortifications under the cry of wai—war A buint child
dreaded the fire Nevei could he foiget that memorab'e time
when, at the dead hour of night, the Presi W being in the
Capitol and the session about to expire, it was pioposed to place
in his hands- three millions of dollars undei the alleged danger
of immediate war The measure, undei a soit of hallelujah
feeling, was shouted through the House most methodistically
He chose to btand on the same giound wheie gentlemen pre
ceding Inm in the debate had planted themselves The state
of our for ign relations was tobe officially communicated to
the House from the Executive Depaitmeut To that som ce
the House was to look, and, lKhere was indeed any approach
of war, it was time the President warned the House to prepaie
for it, but in his message he had expressed a hope that the re
lations of peace might be preserved He admitted that it was
good pohev m peace to prepaie for war, and he should show
in proper time that the Navy lequiied laige appropriations
even foi a peace establishment But he could not yield to
this war panic, when, in his apprehension there was less pros
pect of war than there had been when the thiee millions appio
pnations was voted down
Mr W thought that the propei course was not pursued in
regard to the estimates of the Departments It seemed to him
that, when the ( abinet was assembled the fn t ofhcei heaid
should be the Secretaiy of the Treasuiy, then the War officer 
of the Government, and then our foreign relations and th^ Post
Office, and, if it was found that we had not money enough to
meet the demands of them all, their est mates, ought to be sub
jected toa geneial scale of reduction, according to their relative
importance and the amounts respectively requned But at this
session the estimates of the 'aecieta y i f the Tieasuiy were not
in propoition to those of the othei Depaitments A million
ana a half which was necessary for the navy had never been
sent in at all, while the amount for the Wai Department ex
hibited an excess of over a million Oui naval stations re
quued to be increased and stiengthened, and at such a time it
was vciy extraoidmary that an amount ¡should be asked loi
fortifications which could not be expended until next year
Mr W complimented Mr McKay on his good sense and vi
gilance, and attributed it to his explanations with those of Ins
colleagues Ml Shepperd and Mr Renchlr that he had been
enlightened as to the tiuebeaungs of the pie*cnt bill Had
he been called on to vote one hour befoi< they commenced to
speak, he should haye voted foi the bill but in tin present
siate of the Ireasury, economy and pmdt-nce lerpmed that
eveiy dollar here a^kedfoi lortification6* should he refused.
Mr FlLLMORb txpie&sed gieat surprint at the quarter from
which such objections proceeded 1 he gentleman from Virgi
ma could not vote the sum  in this bill because the whole
amount could not be expended during the present yeai, and
yet how many days was it since that very gentleman reported
and earnestly pressed through the House a bill im ordnance ap
propmtmg moiethan hail a million, a fait ol it for vessels
whose keels were not yet laid? Did any gentleman suppose,
did the cerwleman himself imagine that th<* biimi in thatbill
could be xpended duung the pieseut year'1 What evidence
had n piodueed that money was needed so lung m advance for
irdance stores that could m t be u&ed peilwps f >i years to come
The same gentleman had íeported a bill foi i home
squadion, which bill contained appiopnations for the
support of the entire squadron for an entire yeai, not
only foi the íesidue of the present yeai but for a
year from this time What became oí the gentle man'*, doc
tune oí not appropriating any thing foi nevtyeai'' And be
Bides, he wouldask the gentleman whethci the ete im írigatCb,
foi thesuppoit ol which a piitoftheappioptiation was isked,
were yet built? oi if he could tell when they would be?
Mr WIsD said that he had before told the gentleman that
those frigates were not yer built but they would be soon
Mi 1IÍ LMORE rejoined He was not opposed to the ord
nance bdl He had voted lor Us i assage But he was a little
imu d to &ee the gentleman refuse the present bill, on grounds
ofotjection, every one of which would have destroyed the othei
bill, tor which he had been so wann anadvoetie The gentle-
min, too, wasniMrtkcn m hib fhjureb nul it Mi F might be
allowed to bay so appealed to be i little too i xuiib to defeat
thH bill Mi P did n)t doubt the gentleman s pifnotism but
his own figmetj would unfortunately defeat his own ngiunetit
I he gentleman had stated that the fivti age dm ii tin twelve
yeai**, expended on fortifications huí been $Qub 000 a year This,
was the rate at which the last Adminibti ttionhadappropnated,
and our fortiesses ueieiudil tpidation We had now to appro
priafe, m íaet fmthewcikof two year and a half namely,
for what ought to have been done ;n 1640 f r what wa<¡ now
doing m 1841, and foi what must be done in the early part of
1842 Now, taking the unexpended balance oi appropriations
at $784 000 and the amount in the bill $940000 it made a total
of él,724 000 for two year  and a hall, wh ch was an average of
little over $689 000 a year—which wastes'* inste id of larger,
than the average insisted on by th* gentleman
Mt P concluded by calling upon Mi Wise to come up to the
aid of hifc.ee an try, and while he urged large sum" foi thp navy,
only a part of which could be expended duung the pie-^nt yeai,
nottorefu e the necessaiy appropiiation  foi putting the na
tional defences in a pi oper state of repair
Mi CU¡sfII?sC remarked that the gentleman from Tennes
bee [Mi Wattsrson] m the í muse of his speech to day had
said that at the last session he (Mr C ) had ma le a war speech,
and that he wa« crying peace — peace He deme 1 that on
hih pait there had been any change of opinion orto ie as to the
course of Gieat Bntain He denied that he had made the cry
of war at one time an] peace itanother He challenged gentlemen
to look into the íeniaiks he had nidde at different times, and see
whether he had changed Im tone or opinion in legarel to the
conduct of Great Britain, and whether he had notalways «po
ken of the necessity of maintaining the honoi and rights of our
country He repeated that he deni d that there had been any
change of puipose and more than all did lie deny that theie had
been any change of motive, though he might peihaps have
expressed himself with more caution at the present session in
consequence of the responsible situation in whk,h the Speaker
of this House had thought proper to pi ice him He begged
leove to make this denial m order that it might go forth to the
counti y at the same time a& the remarks oi the gentleman from
Tennessee
After a few remarks from Mr UNDERWOOD, that gentle
man yielded to a motion that the committee rise, which motion
prevailing, the committee rose, reported progress, and obtained
leave to sit again
Mr WISE offered the following resolution, which (after some
conversation) was adopted
Resolved, That the Secretary of War be requested to furnish
d statement showing the amount of unexpended appropriations
for fortifications for the year 1841, and the time in which such
unexpended balances will be expended
Mi PROFFIT offered the following resolution
Resolved, That, from and after two o'clock p m to mor
row, all debate in Committee of the Whole on House bill No
8 shall ceise, and the committee shall pioceed to vote on the
amendments then pending, or tha„ may be offered to said bill,
and the same shall then be reported to the House with such
amendments as may have been agreed to by the committee
Provided, That nothing m this resolution shall prevent tbe
committee from reporting the bill to the House at an earlier
hom if it shall think proper
Mr P moved the pieVious question
Mi GILMER moved to lay the resolution on the table,
which motion, by ayp=5 6fi noe^ 7% was rejected
A motion was made that the House adjourn, which was re-
And the question recuiring on the demand for the previous

IN SENATE.
Saturday, July 17, 1841.
Mr. CALHOUN said he rose to present,  at tbe
request of a public meeting held in Buckmham
county, Virginia, a iew days since, several reso-
lutions pa^9ed at mee ing expressing Jfs opinions
in relation to this extra ^esMon of Congress The
meeting, as he understood irom undoubted autho-
rity, was composed of the mo >t ínfluenüal, talent-
ed, and wealthy citizens or the county, and was
presided over by Mr, Charles Yancy  whose high
respectability would be unquestioned. At that
meeting seven resolutions were passed, the object
of which he (Mr. C ) would briefly state, and then
have the iebo'ut;on>> themselves read.
Mr Calhoun recapitulated the resolution?, and
<aid he need not tell the Senate that he concurred
most heartily in all their sentiment* it is the first
voice on this occasion, (referring to the extra ses-
iun,) and it is right it should come from the An-
cient Dominion i*hicb has been ever re-'d) to start
the foremost all m the iront ranks for ihe defence of
the people This ib a voice that will reverberate
from every Stale m tbe Union Ins poitemous
of (he fate of the Bank bill should it ever pass into
law, and -hows that "repeal" will be the rally-
ing cry of the people The sentiments of these
resolutions show that the right of repeal is held to
be undoubted.
Now, the moment the Bank party came into
power, its first object was to pass those measures
which are to lead to or insure a Bank charter,
which is to b<> earned in defiance of all warning
and opposition If there could be any doubt of the
right oí repeal, would not such a course not only
justify it, but demand it? The opposition here has
given open and fair notice—the country has given
notice—that such charLer mu t be repealed. How,
then, in the face of all ihis, can there be any pre-
text for branding as monstrous or unconstitutional
the determm tion to repeal? It was his (Mr, Cal-
houn's) solemn beheí that a National Bank xs in-
