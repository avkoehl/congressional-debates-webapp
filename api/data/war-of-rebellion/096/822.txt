[MARCH 3, 1865]

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Harper's Ferry:

The major-general commanding thinks you had better send Colonel Bird's regiment to the point where the railroad leaves the river near the lowest ford and let him picket, in connection with Colonel Reno, the road from this point to Charleston. You can thus relieve a part of Reno's cavalry, and he should extend toward Leetown. Between Colonels Reno and Bird the line between Charleston and the Ferry ought to be strong enough to prevent passage.

C. H. MORGAN,

Brevet Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

Brigadier-General.

Colonel J. H. OLEY:

I have just learned that Ripley, the county seat of Jackson, was captured last night by the rebels; the court was also captured. Judge Loomis was holding court there.

JAS. A. SMITH,

Captain and Provost-Marshal.

CUMBERLAND, March 3, 1865.

Colonel OLEY:

The general commanding directs that you send parties through to Roane, Wirt, and Calhoun Counties and clear the rebels out of them. There are about 150 guerrillas in there eating out the country. Report fully what you do, and acknowledge receipt of this telegram.

ROBT. P. KENNEDY,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
