HEADQUARTERS, In the Field, 4 Miles from Walker's Ford, December 4, 1863.

GENERAL: I have received a telegram from Mrs. Burnside for the general, which I have taken the liberty to forward to Knoxville, having sent two couriers. I also communicated the intelligence that our forces had met with a success at Walker's Ford, that General Sherman would reach him to-day, and that Granger was close at hand. We are suffering for the want of axes, horse and mule shoes, and nails. Would it not be well to telegraph Captain Hall, assistant quartermaster at Camp Nelson, to send on immediately in light loads the above-mentioned articles; also trenching tools.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding,&amp;c.

Major-General FOSTER.

P. S.-There is a train at Cumberland Gap loaded with hard bread for First Division, Ninth Army Corps. As it will be impossible for the infantry to move without rations, will you please have the bread ordered on to us?

FOUR MILES FROM WALKER'S FORD, December 5, 1863-9.15 a.m.

GENERAL: Immediately upon the receipt of your first instructions yesterday I sent the necessary orders to Colonel Graham, who ordered out the blockading party at once to Bean's Station road Rutledge and Blain's Cross-Roads, one regiment on top of the mountain. This, of course, rendered the blockading expedition impracticable. Some of Colonel Graham's scouts yesterday were pursued, and by mistake of the guides were conducted into the enemy's lines toward Knoxville, and finally made their escape by taking to the mountains. Enemy's force from "Haversower's" road to Rutledge estimated at 10,000; Ransom's force estimated from 5,000 to 6,000. There is a large direction of Clinton report the enemy's picket at Lay's Cross-Roads.

Among the wounded reported in the fight of December 2 is

Major-General Martin.

Yours, respectfully,

O. B. VILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General FOSTER.

FOUR MILES FROM WALKER'S FORD, December 5, 1863-12.15 p.m.

GENERAL: Colonel Graham is threatened with an immediate attack, and is probably now engaged. I have therefore ordered back another regiment to Walker's Ford, making two regiment and two guns to cover the ford. I shall wait here until I hear from Colonel Graham again.

Yours, respectfully,

O. B. VILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General FOSTER.
