THE1 CONGRESSIONAL' GLOBE.
June 11,
motion ef the Senator from -Michigan that the
Senate recede from its remaining amendments.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I desire to inquire whether
the House of Representatives has added any
amendments on whic^ the Senate has not passed.
If not, I have no objection to passing on our other
amendments in gross.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The other House
has made an amendment to one amendment of the
Senate.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I should like to hear it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The forty-first
amendment of the Senate was to add to the bill:
Sec. 3. Jlnd be it further enacted, That it shall be lawful
for any commissioned officer of the Army to administer the
prescribed oath of enlistment to recruits, piovided theie ho
no civil magistrate authorized to administer the same within
reach.
The amendment of the House is to strike out
the words " within reach" and insert:
Where the services of a civil magistrate authorized to
administer the same cannot be obtained.
The Chair supposes this amendment not to be
included in the motion of the Senator from Mich-
igan, as the House has concurred in it, with an
amendment. The motion of the Senator from
Michigan is, that the Senate recede from its re-
maining amendments in which the House non-
concurred.
Mr. ALLEN". I hope the amendments will be
read, so that we may know what we are voting
on.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Secretary
will read the next amendment disagreed toby the
House.
The Secretary read the sixteenth amendment,
as follows:
To enable the Secretary of War to examine and report
upon suitable sites for an airnory and foundeiy in the West
and on the Pacific coast, $10,000.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Will the Senate
recede from the amendment?
Mr. ALLEN. I only desired to know what
the amendments were. I do not ask for a sepa-
rate vote on each.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Secretary will
read the amendments which have been disagreed
to by the House.
The Secretary read:
Seventeenth amendment:
To enable the Secretary of War to compensate F. W.
Lander for somce* performed, and expenses nieunrd by
Jnm in making rceonnojs^anees foraiatlioad fiom Pu<jet
Sound via the South f\in>, tu the itfinm.-Mppi mvcj, in
1851-55, $4,750, o) so much thereof as the naid Spcrotaiy
mavcoiHiderieason.iblo and pioperm consuleiaiion ofsaid
services and expenses.
Eighteenth amendment:
For payment of volunteers operating in Florida during
the yeai 1857, $385,OO0.
Nineteenth amendment.;
For continuing the construction of the following works
of detente 
Mr. PUGH. It is not necessary to read that.
"We all understand it. It is the fortification amend-
ment.
Mr. ALLEN. 1 propose that we suspend the
further reading of the amendments.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no ob-
jection, the further reading of the amendments
will be dispensed with, and the Chair will put
the question on the motion made by the Senator
from Michigan that the Senate recede from its
remaining amendments, which have been disa-
greed to by the House of Representatives.
The motion was not agreed to.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will
now put the question on the motion of the Senator
from Mississippi, that the Senate insist on its
amendments disagreed to by the House of Repre-
sentatives, disagree to the House amendment to
its forty-first amendment, and ask for a confer-
ence on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses.
The motion was agreed to;and Messrs. Davis,
Collamer, and Sudell, were appointed con-
ferees on the part of the Senate,
A message was afterwards received from the
House of Representatives, by Mr. Allen, its
Clerk, announcing that the House insisted upon
its disagreement to certain amendments of the
Senate to the bill (H. R, No. 243) making ap-
propriations for the support of the Army for the
year ending the 30th June, 1859, and upon its
amendment to the forty-first amendment of the
Senate to the said bill; agreed to the conference
asked by the Senate on the disagreeing votes of
the two Houses thereon, and had appointed Mr.
John A. Qjjiti^an, Mr. Martin J. Crawford,
and Mr. Benjamin Stanton, managers at the
same, on its part.
THE DROMEDARY.
Mr. DAVIS. I wish to present to the Senate
a manuscript in regard to the dromedary. I will
state that my official connection as a Senator, and
as Secretary of War, with the introduction of cam-
els into this country, and the personal interest I
took in the subject, have kept me more or less in
correspondence in regard to it for some years. Our
consul general at Alexandria, Mr. De Leon, has
obtained very valuable additions to the knowledge,
which we have in relation to this animal hereto-
fore,from William Reckyan Bey. Itis veryinter-
estmg, and very instructive; and if we are to use
this animal in the service of the United States, it
must be very beneficial to the Government, both
in regard to the introduction and management of
the animal after it has been brought here. This
manuscript treats of its characteristics, itshistory,
its diseases, its use in war, and is an addition to
the information wc have heretofore received,
which, I think, will be very useful to the country
and quite essential to the military arm of our ser-
vice, if the further introduction of this animal is
to be continued. It has been sent to me in a com-
plimentary way, and I present it to the Senate, in
order that it may be printed for the public good,
if the Senate choose to print it. If, however, it
should be decided not to be of sufficient value to
justify its printing, I shall, of course, claim it
again as my private property, and make such dis-
position of it as I please. I move that it be print-
ed for the uso of the Senate, and that two thou-
sand extra copies be printed for the use of the War
Department; which motion, I suppose, will go to
the Committee on Printing.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The motion will
go, under the rules, to the Committee on Printing.

MAJOR GENERAL TOWSON.
Mr. BELL. The Committee on Naval Affairs
to whom was referred the joint resolution (S.No.
26) for the benefit of the nearest male heir of the
late Major General Towson of the United States
Army, deceased, have instructed me to report it
back without amendment, and to ask that the
Senate will now consider it. Justice has been
long delayed, and the committee are unanimous
in the recommendation of this resolution, which
proposes to give a mark of distinction for gallant
services in the last war with England for a par-
ticular act; such mark of distinction as has been
given to others who had no greater share of honor
and distinction than General Towson; but, by
some accident or other, he has been omitted.
By unanimous consent the resolution was con-
sidered as in Committee of the Whole. It is a
"request to the President to cause a sword to be
prepared with suitable emblems and devices, and
presented to Nathan Towson Caldwell, grandson
of the late Major General Nathan Towson, of the
United States Army, for his gallant conduct in
the capture of the British brig Caledonia on the
Niagara river, near Fort Erie.
The joint resolution was reported to the Senate,
ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, read
the third time, and passed.

rived for the consideration of the question of priv-
ilege which was setfor to-day at twelve o'clock.
