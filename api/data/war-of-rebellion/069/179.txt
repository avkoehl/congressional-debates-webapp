GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS, May 24, 1864-7.50 a.m.

Major-General GILLMORE:

The commanding general directs me to ask you how the discrepancy of nearly 2,000 men arises between your estimate of troops and the regular tri-monthly return?

R. S. DAVIS,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

GILLMORE'S, May 24, 1864-10.15 a.m.

Major R. S. DAVIS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The statement called for was an approximate estimate of the effective force of my command. In answer I sent the number present for duty equipped. By referring to the columns in the tri-monthly bearing this heading it will be found that if any discrepancy exists it is insignificant.

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.
