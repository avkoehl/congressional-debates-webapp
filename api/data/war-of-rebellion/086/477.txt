What will be dome with the men paroled by rebel bands passing through? The rebs killed one of my command after he had surrendered and beat him on the head with muskets.

Major COSGROVE,

Commanding, Lebanon:

Such paroles are not recognized in any way. Has Captain Cassairt reported to you? I can hear nothing of him. If he is there, direct him to move to Cassville as soon his command is rested.

LEBANON, November 7, 1864.

Captain W. T. KITTREDGE:

The dismounted of General McNeil's brigade have gone through. They have acted very badly all the way, having robbed Union women and men of money on several occasions; the men could not be identified. I have taken some horses which officers could not vouch for. I believe several went through the woods and around the post. Major Leonard did all he could to adjust the matter, but could [not]. A number [of] officers don't try to enforce discipline.

J. COSGROVE,

Major, Commanding Post.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., November 7, 1864.

Major COSGROVE,

Commanding, Lebanon:

The general commanding directs that you procure the names of all officers and men of McNeil's command charged with plundering, stating the amount of damage done by each, in order that the same may be stopped against them. Retain all horses unbranded that you find in hands of enlisted men.

WM. T. KITTREDGE,

LEBANON, November 7, 1864

Captain W. T. KITTREDGE:

The detachment of General McNeil's brigade is twelve miles from here how. I have done all that was in my power to identify some of the officers and men engaged in destroying property, and all to no avail. I have ordered the provost-marshal to take depositions in the matter. Nearly all the command is guilty.

J. COSGROVE,

Major, Commanding Post.
