HDQRS. FIRST NEW YORK VETERAN CAVALRY,Camp near Strasburg, Va., May 17, 1864.

Lieutenant WYCKOFF,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to most respectfully report that on May 16, 1864, 9.30 p.m., I started from camp in command of fifty men on a scout.

I marched to Shenandoah River, opposite Front Royal, Va. The river being very high, I could not cross the same to Front Royal (bridge destroyed). I saw no appearances of the enemy on the way going and coming. I halted at the aforesaid ford until 8 o'clock this a. m. I arrived in camp at 10 a. m., to-day.

Very respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,

H. W. SCOTT.

Captain Co. M., First New York Veteran Cav., Commanding Scout.

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

General Weber reports that both spans of trestle-work of the Harper's Ferry bridge were carried away by the high water last night. Also a portion of the pontoon bridge. I have directed the engineer officer in charge to make a requisition on the Engineer Department at Washington for boats and timber to repair the pontoon. Will you please it to be sent without delay? It will require several days to repair the railroad bridge. Two more Ohio regiments will arrive here this a. m. for Washington.
