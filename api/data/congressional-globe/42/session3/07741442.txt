political disabilities.
Mr. HAMILTON, of Texas. I now move
to take up Senate bill No. 1539, which was

The VICE PRESIDENT. There were two
disability bills passed over informally on
account of the absence of the Senator from

will now be considered.

ical disabilities of James D. Halyburton, of
Virginia, and Thomas G. Williams, of San
Antonio, in the State of TWas, was read the
second time, and considered as in Committee
of the Whole.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I move to amend the
bill by inserting' the word " political " before
the word " disabilities ; " so as to exclude any
conclusion about rights of private property.
That makes the bill conform to what the Con-
stitution intended it should be.
Mr. BOREMAN. I think that is so now.
It is here on the Calendar, " A bill to remove
the political disabilities," &c.
Mr. EDMUNDS. As the Secretary read
the bill, that word was not in it.
The Chief Clerk. The bill reads "that all
disabilities."
_ The VICE PRESIDENT. The title of the
bill contains the words '' political disabilities.''

bill to have that word " political" in it.

no objection to the amendment.
The amendment was agreed to.
