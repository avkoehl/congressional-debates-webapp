Lieutenant-General LEE, Commanding, &c.:

If you find Bate too much exposed to a flank attack to-night the general thinks you had [better] fall back into the line at Baugh's. You must judge of the necessity, getting all the information you can from Jackson. Should you fall back, try to carry off whatever arms, &c., there may be in your front.
