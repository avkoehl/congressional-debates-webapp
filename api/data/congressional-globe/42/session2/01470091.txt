hour that has had no parallel in the history
of mankind for many centuries. I speak ad-
visedly and from a full knowledge of the facts.
I hold in ray hand Spanish authorities to sus-
tain me. On the 5th day of December, 1869,
the president of the council made a statement
to the Cortes of Spain in regard to the forces
and material of war sent to Cuba since the
commencement of the insurrection. He spoke
as follows:
'£ Last Saturday Seiior Navarro y Rodrigo addressed
certain inquiries to the minister of war which I could
not answer immediately. I said, however, that there
had gone to Cuba some thirty thousand men, and to-
day I will read a statement of the land and sea forces,
and of thematerial which has gone to Cuba since the
revolution, because this proves the vitality and en-
ergy of the Government and of all Spain exercised
in the preservation of the island of Cuba.
"The first forces which went there were 771 vol-
unteers; then 5,400 men of the regular service; after-
wards the series of battalions which were asked for
by General Dulce, (may he rest in peace 1) 1.000 went
from Baza, 1,000 from Chiclana, 1,000 from San Quin-
tin, and 1,000 from Simancas, who were so thoroughly
equipped that they were able to take the field im-
mediately on their arrival. Since that the successive
departureshavereachedatotal of 20,966 of the army
of the peninsula; of marines, 2,600; of recruits, 1,371;
and of volunteers, 9,563; which gives a total of 34,500
men, according to the accompanying statement. I
would call attention to the tact that this immense
sum would represent a great effort for any nation
whatever.
"The following is a statement of the forces em-
barked for the island of Cuba since the beginning of
November, 1868, when the intelligence of the insur-
rection arrived:

"There have gone also!4ships of war, amongthem
two iron-clad frigates; a complete equipment for a
regiment of mountain artillery, with 24 pieces, 24cais-
sons for artillery of 8 centimeters bore; 20 Krupp
steel guns of 8 centimeters bore; 4,000 projectiles for
thesame; 5,000 kilograms of powder; 7,400,000 car-
tridges ofl4i caliber, model of1857 and 1859; 1.000,000
metallic cartridges for needle-guns; 10,500,000 caps;
15,000 kilograms of lead; 9,600 carbines, model of
1857; 3,600 muskets, model of1859 ; 8,000 Enfield rifles;
3,000 Berdan; 500 short carbines; 1,000lances; 2,000
sabers.
" This is an amount of material which seems im-
possible to have gone from Spain.
"There have been sent 12,530 different articles,
composed of medicine-chests, mattresses, &c.
'^Fifteen hundred seamen have alsogone. Ihope
Senor Navarro will bo satisfied with my explana-
tion."
Sir, this is an immense force to transport
across the Atlantic ocean, and implies a fearful
struggle. But, large as it is, our well-informed
minister to Spain, writing from Madrid, Decem-
ber 29, 1869, says :
"There is no doubt that the estimate is much
below the number of troops raised for service in
Cuba since the insurrection."
Every effort has been made to conceal the
real magnitude of the conflict, and yet it is
officially confessed that an army and navy
nearly forty thousand strong were launched
from the shores of Spain against this American
island during the first year that the banner of
revolt waved over her. This does not include
theregular troops already there, the volunteers
that were raised, and the vessels of war in Cuban
water3when theyoke of Spain was firstresisted.
The American minister, General Sickles, trans-
mitted to his Government the following state-
ment under date of December 29, 1869. Its
correctness has never been called in question:
Estimate of the Spanish forces composing the Army
of Cuba, compiled from the statement published in
Ln Iberia of December 26, 1869,and from semi-offi-
cial sources of information.
The strength of battalions, batteries, andsquadrons
conforms to the regulations of the Spanish service.

talions of 800 each 12,800

T wo battalions of the guard, ail veterans, 1,000
each  2,000
Two battalions of militia, (estimated)  1,600
Eleven battalions of infantry, organized in
Cuba, (estimated to be of the same strength
as peninsular light infantry)  11,000
Total  52,400
Artillery,
One regiment, two battalions of four batteries

Marines, tour battalions  4,000

Total     107,400
Who will say that an army of one hundred
and seven thousand four hundred men operat-
ing in an area not so large as the State of New
York does not signify an actual war of vast
proportions and of the most destructive char-
acter? This fact defies and silences contro-
versy on that point.
It may be said, however, that this display of
strength occurred in the first year of the revo-
lution; that the Government of Spain accom-
plished its purposes of subjugation, and that
the dimensions of the war have dwindled away
since then. I submit official documents to es-
tablish the contrary. Seventeen months after
the transmission of the estimate of forces which I
have just given the American minister made the
following communication to this Government;
[No. 349.]
Legation of the United States.
Madrid, May 30.1871.
Sir : In a recent conversation with a distinguished
Spanish general, whose official employments afford
him ample means of accurate information, he told
me that more than forty million dollars had been
expended for military purposes during the past year
m Cuba. He did not state whether or not this large
sum included any portion of the amount disbursed
for the fieetof gun-boats maintained in those waters
especially with reference to the insurrection.
My informant added that the aggregate force under
arms exceeded one hundred thousand men, more
than half of whom were regular troops, and that the
losses of the army of Cuba, from the various casu-
alties of the service, exceeded eighteen thousand
men. It was his impression that the insurgent force
did not number more than six thousand of all arms.
I hear from trustworthy sources, likely to be well
informed, that the insurgents have lost no ground
of importance; that their troops are better armed
and better disciplined than heretofore; and that in
several recent actions they havo gained considerable
advantages over the Spanish troops, many of whom
are represented as deserting to the insurgents. Re-
ports of the most cruel severities against prisoners
of war and against non-combatants, perpetrated by
both parties, continue to reach Madrid.
The consul at Cadiz informs me that several detach-
ments of troops, destined for service in Cuba, have
embarked from thatport within the past two months.
I am, &e., D. E. SICKLES.
The "distinguished Spanish general" who
gave this striking information was Serrano him-
self. There is no higher authority in the king-
dom of Spain. It is thus proven from his lips
that less than nine months ago the Spanish
forces in Cuba exceeded one hundred thousand
men j that more than one half of them were
regular troops ; that the war for the preceding
year had cost more than forty million dollars,
and that the loss of men in the service during
the same period had exceeded eighteen thou-
sand. 1 pause to inquire whether this denotes
actual war or not. Will the Department of
State answer? These facts are ail known to
the authorities of this Government. Do they
constitute a state of war in which two parties
instead of only one must be recognized by the
nations of the earth? That is the question
which I press home, and to which I shall con-
tinue to demand an answer.
But the evidence on this point goes even
further. Within the last five months, on the
22d day of September, 1871, the old Spanish
organ, the Diario de la Marina, at Havana,
contained an appeal to the home Government
for thirty thousand additional reenforcements
with which to enter upon the autumn campaign,
of which the following is a translation:
"As autumn approaches we find that the emigrants
(Cubans) appear to be disposed to send all the aid
they possibly can to the rebels; that they possess for
the purpose five or six steamers of different nation-
alities, to be used in bringing a few more drops of
oil to keep tho lamp of the rebellion from going out;
that almost all the rebel bands have been reconcen-
trated in the eastern department and at Las Tunas,
undoubtedly disposed to improve every opportunity
for doing evil.
"The rebellion of Yara will soon celebrate its third
anniversary, and its partisans will repeat in all lan-
guages, in America and in Europe, in the island of
Cuba and in Spain, that it has entered into its fourth
year of war, that the rebellion is invincible, and
that, sooner or later, we shall have to give up the
ground to them.
"We well know the latter will not take place; but
we wish at the same time that the armed struggle
be not prolonged any further than the winter cam-
paign. To accomplish this, it is necessary to pror
ceed with untiriDg activity and with indomitable
energy. It is necessary to perfectly guard our coasts
and to cover with troops all the territory around tho
rebellion. In order to obtain the former we need
three or four more ships of the speed and conditions
of the Churruca and the Tornado; to realize the
second, we insist on asking the Government of his
Majesty, which is as much interested as we are, that
the peaceof the country be reestablished, that, over
and above the ten thousand men now ready, to send
ten thousand more, and eveh twenty thoSsand would
be a hundred times better. .
"We are fully persuaded—and we say it with all
frankness, because the truth eannot in any manner
prejudice a cause so noble and holy as that which we
defend—we are fully persuaded that the wan t of four
or six thousand men disposable at the will of the
captain general of the island has been the cause that
the rebellion has not received on determined occa-
sions a final blow, and our conscience demanas of us
to do all that is humanely possible that this may not
recur. .. A . ., .
" Obeying this call of conscience, considering our-
selves the interpreter of the general sentiments of
all tho Spaniards of Cuba, we ask that the Govern-
ment may send twenty thousand men at least, and
if, to maintain these men, extraordinary resources
should be necessary, we will notlaek the valor to de-
mand, and even to exact, the means of those who are
able to furnish them."
