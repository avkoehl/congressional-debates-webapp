GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I inspected the line of the Second Corps as per instructions. The right of the line rests on the Appomattox River, and the left at Fort Alexander Hays. The troops were disposed as follows:

First Division, Brigadier-General Miles commanding - Battery Numbers 4, garrison of 154 men; Battery Numbers 5, garrison of 150 men; Fort McGilvery, garrison of 300 men; Battery Numbers 9, garrison of 100 men; Fort Stedman, garrison of 300 men; Battery Numbers 11, garrison of 80 men; Battery Numbers 12, garrison of 40 men;; Fort Haskell, garrison of 300 men; Battery Numbers 13, garrison of 20 men; Battery Numbers 14, garrison of 57 men; in line from Appomattox River to Battery Numbers 9, 325 men; in line from Battery Numbers 9 to Fort Stedman, 152 men; in line from Fort Stedman to Fort Haskell, 629 men; in line from Fort Haskell to Fort Morton, 600 men; picketing the river from Spring Hill Fort to Battery Numbers 5, 295 men. There is no picket-line in front of the works from the Appomattox River to near Fort Stedman, but during the night vedettes are thrown out. In front of Fort Stedman a picket of 50 men; a picket-line between Forts Haskell and Morton of 210 men; a guard at Cedar Level of 140 men; reserve force near Friend's house, 1,200 men. The men were close to the works, one-third of the number in the line with their accouterments on; those between Fort Stedman and the Appomattox, accouterments on at all times. The garrisons at the forts had their regular guards. The rest of the men were without accouterments. They are in line at 4 o'clock in the morning until after daylight, prepared in case of attack. They were building a second line between Battery Numbers 9 and Fort Stedman, which would soon be finished.
