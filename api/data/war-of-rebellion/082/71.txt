WAR DEPARTMENT, July 7, 1864.

Brigadier-General BARNES,

Point Lookout:

The order of General Grant assigning General Hinks to Point Lookout was made in ignorance of the fact that the post was no longer in General Butler's command. The order of the Department assigning you is superior to all others. General Hinks has been directed to report to the Adjutant-General in Washington for duty. You cannot be too vigilant, as the enemy is now operating in Maryland in large force.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, Washington, July 7, 1864.

Colonel Townsend has been instructed to telegraph to General Hinks that General Barnes is commander of Point Lookout and District of Saint Mary's, and that he, General Hinks, will relinquish the command and report back to General Butler.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT N. SCOTT,

Captain, Fourth U. S. Infantry, Aide-de-Camp.
