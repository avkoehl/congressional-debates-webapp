voted, but only h° amoant unpaid for the balance of
the year, which, had it been paid in advance, no
one would a«k h s family to reiund because he hid
died dunns ihe year, and of wh ch mifortuns Mr
W. would pot avail himself to witnhold this sum
(as it was not paid) from the family of ihe decezs-

tice, and not as a pensi n or s>ratuily    The prece-
dent, it was ^aid, was dangerous      Bu' for what
was it a precent, except for this, that another Presi-
dent should unfortunately die wahin a short time
after h s inauguration, having nece sanly incurred
expens s in the pub ic service far beyond the com-
pensation allowed, the nation should permit his sa-
lary, unpaid for the remainder of the year, to be
received by h <¡ surviving widow     My worthy and
distinguís ed frnnd from   S uth  Carolina [Mr
Calhoun] has been most ardent in his denuncia-

for which the S nat r voted, who now cnaigis m°
with violating ihe Constitution  in sustaining this
bill.   The Senator says he voted for this becau e
it was external, it concerned our foreign relations,
and as to them the powers of th« Gov rnuient aie
not limited, that in that respect the powers of the
Government are national, but 'hat they are not so

The Government Wa  no' a Government  of   in

ers limited and enumerated, and in all ca es pos-
sessed only the gran'ed powers and tluse essential
to their due execution     Upon looking at the Con-
stitution, it would belound that it did not make an
unlimited general grant 01 all power as regar I-, our
foreign relations, but it specified and  enumerated
those powers.   Thus, it granted specifically fower
to make war, to provide a navy, to punish p ra-
cies on the high ^e is, to  giant letter   (i marque
and repr sal, &c , but why enumerate these pow

Mr YOUiNG ^aid f-at it ?p Pared to him 'hat
the sum propose lo be (onatrd (*25 000) was
very larpe, but tha1 it it was intended to bestow so
much, he would suggest to the conrat ee which
had lepar el tt whether, uader the crcum tance?,
t ie sum of $9 000 onherxabout-, which stood upon
the bock of tbe Treasury Department as an m-
cumbiaucc upon the estate of the late President,
ought not to be deducted from it He said that he
had been informed that this «umhad been found
due by tbe accounting officers of ihe Treasury
against the late J C S Hairison as receiver of
tbe ¡and office a Vihcennes, and that the late Pre-
sident w?s he sicunty for the payment of it He
had also been informed that the widow of J C S.
Harrison was the daughter of ihe late Gen Pike,
one of the most gal'ant and meritorious officers in
the late war, who might now be in indigent cir-
cumstances, with blasted hopes for the iu,ure, in
consequence of this hf-avy indebtedness, altogether,
perhaps, beyond the means of herself or childrsn to
pay. Would not the committee, therefore, by
adop nig such aa amendment, perform a double act
of charity by discharging the widow and children
of the late J C S Harrison from a debt they are
unable to pay, asd at the same time relieving the
estate of the late Pre ident fiom a very serious, in-
cumbrance, for whieh it may ultimate'y become
liable, and st II leave Mrs. Harreen (his widow)
with a very hand one gratuity'
Mr MAN GUM said lhat the Senator from Illi-
neis had stated the'um truly at about $9 000, but
that by the act of Congress of 1831, it would not
become payab'e until about the year 1848 He
sa.d that the widow of J C. S. Harrison had died
since the passage of the act, leaving several chil-
dren—that he was informed the children had mhe-
rued some real cs ate from their father, «; tuated
somewhere in the neighborhood of Vinceunes,
which would probably all be swept away by this
debt, when it became due, but that he did not think
it ought to oe blended with this measure of relief,
ii tended olely tor the berefit of the widow of the
la>e President
Mr YOUNG resumed He said lhat when
G ii ei al Washington was ii augurated as the first
Piesident oi th° Uni ed S ates, he recommended to
Cmgress, among other things, to make suitable
provision for the payment of the Chief Magistrate
of the nation on a liberal «cale, but informed them
at Ihe same time lhat hs could not consent to accept
any compensation for his own services And why,
s r? Because he wai in affluent circumstance"',
and did not wish unnecessary to add to the
expense of his countrymen, vhen there was no
occasion for it He said that he had unders ood
from common rumor, that General Harrison had
died possessed of a <ery valuable es ate, with but
a small family dependent upon it, and that he
could not see the uecessi'y of so large an appicpn-
ation He said, that in justice and equity, chart-
table alloivanci's should always be proporttored, m
some degree at leas', to tie style ot ltv ng and con-
di ton of the person to be beaefi ed, and that all
beyond that mustfall under the head of useless, un-
necessary, and, therefore, unjustifiable, extrava-
gance. In respect to the sympathies of the nation
fi r h i laeui" ancholy b rca ement, they had
been um> c a>ly ac-i r ei wit. out d sttnit on as
to pi ce < i p?rtj Notnra had been withheld in
tl ■> w ty of honors to ihe meaiory of the deceased,
pnd why should we be called e,pon now to vote so
Urge a sumfiom the Trp? urv by v ay if g-atuity,
vreti no occa ion u r re lef existed ?
Mr CLAY of Kentucky said, the Senator from
Iihtois was mistaken in supposing tha General
Harr son had died rich—so far from it, he was in 
f rmed by p"r=ons in'ima ely acquainted with the
condition of his estate, that there were large out-
sanding debfs existing agams* it That he left a
farm below Cincinnati, on th'Ohio river, worth,
perhap , thirty or forty dol'ais per acre, but that
that by the time these debts should be liquidated
and paid off, there would b vei-y hule, if any
thing, r^rraimng fir his widow or faaiily
Mr YOUNG con inu d He said 'hat he had
rot before unders ood that the es'a e of th- late
P.e^de t was man emba-rass^d eo di ion But
he was sagged from the explanation made by he
Senator frcm Kentuiky, [Mr Clay] that such
was the ca*e. This eircunstance, he sad, had
changed the ¡nteiticri wi h wh ch he hdd arisen,
which was, lo have raovrd an amendment, to strike
$25,000, and insert §6 250, the amount of a quar-
ter'  salary, which he stul thought quite sufficient,
but Le would not now propose such an amendment,
bat leave the matter to the management of the
