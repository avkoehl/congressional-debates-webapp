but stubborn fact that all this occurred in the town of Pleasant Grove in the face and eyes of a population of several hundred people calling themselves civilized and American citizens-God save the mark! Right in the heart of Mormon town, where there were perhaps not less than 100 or 150 white men (Mormons), in the broad daylight 75 or 100 savages attack and attempt to murder six American citizens and do carry off mules, harness, and other Government property, and not a hand is lifted to assist or protect them or to prevent the stealing of the Government property; but on the contrary they stand around the street corners and on top of their houses and hay-stacks complacently looking on, apparently well pleased at the prospect of six Gentiles (soldiers) being murdered. They actually assisted the Indians in catching the Government mules that had effected their escape from the corral, and from their natural fear of the redskins were endeavoring to keep beyond their reach. The foregoing facts speak for themselves. Comment is unnecessary further than to say that Lieutenant Honeyman believes and thinks that he has prima facie evidence of the fact upon which to found his belief that the savages were informed by the Mormons of his presence in the town with only five men, and, as they supposed, a wagon load of provisions, bound for Fort Bridger, and that it was a contrived and partnership arrangement between some of the Mormons and the Indians to murder his little party, take the property, and divide the spoils.

In the morning (April 13) as soon as light I started out scouts in different directions to find the course that the Indians had taken, and at the same time sent an express to the general commanding, notifying him what had occurred, and the position I was in as to transportation for my howitzer and ammunition, as well as to the want of animals for the gunners to ride, &amp;c., and received that evening in reply notice from the general that he had ordered Captain Price with his company to join me, and that he had sent with them mules for the howitzer and gunners in place of those stolen by the Indians. Captain Price arrived with his company, numbering sixty men, about 11 o'clock at night, bringing with him the animals for the howitzer, &c. In the meantime my scouts had returned with the information that they could get no trace of the Indians, excepting that eight of them had passed through the town of Provo, some ten miles to the south of Pleasant Grove with the stolen animals, on their way and in the direction of Spanish Fork. The Mormons, however, insisted upon it that the body of the Indians had scattered and by different routes, had concentranown as Dry Canon, where they had a considerable encampment, and their women and children, and as Lieutenant Honeyman seemed also to think that the Indians who attacked him had come out of this Dry Canon, and as I could find no evidence of a large body of Indians traveling farther south, I concluded to make a drive onDry Canon and satisfy myself as to the fact whether they were there or not. I accordingly started in the morning at 7 o'clock with the howitzer and fifty men up what is known as Provo Canon, and sent Lieutenants Clark and Bradley with the same number of men up Dry Canon, the two canons connecting, or at least there being an outlet at the head of Dry Canon leading over and into Provo Canon. In this way with the force in Provo Canon I was certain to head and cut off the enemy from retreat, provided he was, as represented, encamped in Dry Canon. I, however, found from actual examination after scouring every nook and corner of the two canons, over almost impassable ledges, the men walking and leading their horses and climbing for six hours (and losing
