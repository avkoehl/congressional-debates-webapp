HEADQUARTERS,Spanish Fort, April 4, 1865-11 a. m.

General MAURY:

The 20-pounder Parrott arrived late last night, and negroes. Other things yet to come. Glad to get mortars. Nothing of interest. All well.

R. L. GIBSON,

Brigadier-General.

General D. H. MAURY,

Mobile, Ala.:

Major Marks, commanding Huger and Tracy, reports the enemy has a large whaleboat, or cutter, directly under their batteries on Bay Minette. Can't you get assistance of cutters or naval barges? I have increased my pickets on spit.

R. L. GIBSON,

Brigadier-General.

(Same to General Liddell, Blakely, Ala.)
HEADQUARTERS,Spanish Fort, April 4, 1865.

General MAURY:

Have increased detail on spit; will have two field pieces placed there. Am glad to get the 8-inch mortar, and would like to have one 10-inch mortar. I think we could use one more 30-pounder Parrott to advantage on Battery Numbers 2 (McDermott). Will give you my views in a letter in three days covering all points.

R. L. GIBSON,

Brigadier-General.

APRIL 4, 1865.

General D. H. MAURY,

Mobile, Ala.:

I have been obliged to extend my left flank out to the bay and to build log breast-works that distance. I find this a great labor. I feel quiet certain now that I shall be compelled to do the same thing on my right flank. Can't I get some axes, 100. Enemy's light boat appeared in front of my picket boat to-night, and his fleet fired a few rounds during the bombardment this evening. Can't detachments from the naval service look to my water flanks and communications? The great extension of my flanks makes my line quite thin. Casualties, twenty wounded.

R. L. GIBSON,

Brigadier-General.

(Same to General Liddell, Blakely.)
