WAR DEPARTMENT, BUREAU OF MILITARY JUSTICE,

June 15, 1865.

Respectfully returned to the Secretary of War.

In cases of this character of homicide of one rebel prisoner by another at one of our prison camps this Bureau has expressed and still adheres to the opinion that such crime is not one that can properly be taken cognizance of by a U. S. military court. If the local criminal tribunal should desire to pass upon this or any similar case, the post commandant would properly respond to a formal request to that effect by placing the accused party in the hands of the civil authorities for trial.

In the absence of the Judge-Advocate-General:

WM. WINTHROP,

Major and Judge-Advocate.
