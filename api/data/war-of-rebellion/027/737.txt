By Dr. MILES:

Question. Was it not customary for you to receive orders through your brigade commander?

Answer. It was.

Question. To have orders sent to Colonel Ford, and have him send them to you?

Answer. Yes, sir. There was a great deal of irregularity in reference to orders. Sometimes they would come verbally, and sometimes in the form of a written order, and sometimes one person would bring them and sometimes another.

Question. Was it not customary upon receiving a verbal order, if it was one of any importance, to receive a written order soon afterward?

Answer. I never received any such after a verbal order.

Major CHARLES H. RUSSELL recalled by General White, and examined as follows:

By General WHITE:

Question. Will you state, if you please, what difficulties there were, if any, on Sunday evening in the way of General Franklin's corps moving forward in the direction of Harper's Ferry, any more than there would have been the next day? Were there would have been the next day? Were there any difficulties at that time that would not have been met the next day?

Answer. There was no difficulty except that it was nearly sundown when the enemy was driven from the gap.

Question. this was about 7 miles from Harper's Ferry?

Answer. Yes, sir.

Question. Did any other difficulty except darkness intervene?

Answer. No, sir.

Question. Knowing what you do of the character of the troops at Harper's Ferry, that is, tht a large proportion of them were raw troops, which, in your opinion, would have been most practicable - for the troops at Harper's Ferry to have cut their way out through the enemy, or for General Franklin's corps to have fought their way in?

Answer. It would have been far more practicable for General Franklin's corps to have moved up to Harper's Ferry.

Question. Were the troops at Harper's Ferry, judging from what you saw of their conduct on Maryland Heights, such troops as you would like to attempt to cut your way with through a much heavier force of the enemy?

Answer. No, sir. There was a very small body of reliable troops there. The percentage of reliable troops was quite small.
