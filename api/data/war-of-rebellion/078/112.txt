CAMP NELSON, June 13, 1864.

Captain J. B. DICKSON:

My pickets have just brought in some prisoners - one, Major A. Lawson McAfee, of Nicholasville. There are 1,500 men in detachment. Will send out 100 men to pick up stragglers. Same force you mentioned last night, about, I suppose, 300 men. Have you no cavalry to send out to intercept them? My force is not strong enough for that.

S. S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.

LEXINGTON, KY., June 13, 1864.

Brigadier General S. S. FRY,

Camp Nelson, Ky.:

General Burbridge send me word by couriers from Georgetown, 11. 40 a. m., to send parties toward Mount Sterling to capture straggling rebels. He authorized me to offer a reward of $1,000 to any one who shall capture Colonel D. Howard Smith. Three hundred prisoners are just coming in. If you can spare, send me two good couriers, one to Captain Hamilton, commanding the cavalry sent from here this morning, and one to your cavalry, with orders for both parties to go toward Mount Sterling, informing them of the reward offered for Colonel Smith.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

LEXINGTON, June 13, 1864-7 p. m.

Brigadier General S. S. FRY,

Camp Nelson, Ky.:

General Burbridge has arrived here. Rebel loss at Cynthiana, 300 killed and 400 prisoners, besides wounded. Morgan's force is scattered, out of ammunition, totally demoralized. Colonel Weatherford reached Danville, and, I learn has left in pursuit of the rebels who started for Stanford and Crab Orchard from Lancaster. Don't order our men toward Mount Sterling. If you send courier, order them in hot pursuit south.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

DANVILLE, June 13, 1864-11. 35 a. m.

Brigadier General S. S. FRY,

Commanding:

It is reported that squads of rebels are moving through the country north and northwest of Harrodsburg and Perryville. Do not learn of their committing any depredations but getting something to eat for themselves and horses. Many thanks for your dispatch just received. I hope the good part of is true, and more, too. Colonel Weatherford, with a part of his command, has just left Lebanon, moving in this direction.

W. L. GROSS,

Assistant Superintendent, &amp;c.
