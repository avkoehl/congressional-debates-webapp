HEADQUARTERS VALLEY DISTRICT,May 22, 1862.

Major-General EWELL:

GENERAL: Major-General Jackson directs me to express his regret that the placing of his tents so far to the rear has deprived him of an interview with you this evening. He desires that all your brigades shall move to-morro morning at dawn promptly, except the foremost. That will not move till the brigade next it has closed up to it. All the troops will have three days' rations ready cooked, two in their haversacks and one in wagons. To carry this three days' cooked ration one wagon should be detailed for each regiment. The ambulances and ammunition wagons will follow each regiment. The wagons with the cooked rations will move in the rear of all the troops. The remaining baggage train will be left inc amp under the charge of the chief quartermaster.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. L. DABNEY.

I suppose the wagons stop at or near my headquarters, ten miles from Front Royal. My ammunition train is near General Taylor. Send it on.

R. S. EWELL,

Major-General.

Most respectfully, &amp;c.,
