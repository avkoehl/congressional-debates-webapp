ATLANTA, June 27, 1864.

Major General G. W. SMITH,

Commanding Georgia Troops:

GENERAL: General Johnston wishes that you would concentrate at some convenient point (say Turner's Ferry) as large an infantry force as can be gathered in your command, with a battery, at short notice (leaving some force at the railroad bridge), and cross the river, moving up as to place yourself in communication with Brigadier-General Jackson. The object is to show an infantry force in connection with Jackson's cavalry as a demonstration calculated to deter the enemy from any further attempt to extend his right flank toward the river. It is not intended nor desired that your troops should become engaged, but simply threaten the right and rear of the enemy without losing your direct communication with the river between Turner's Ferry and Sandtown.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. LOVELL,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS HOOD'S CORPS,In the Field, June 27, 1864.

General HINDMAN,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding desires me to say that General Strahl, with two brigades, is now massed in rear of your right, for the purpose of going to the assistance of General Stewart should he be needed. He thinks they will be more apt to be needed there than anywhere else; but should you be pressed, call upon General Strahl for assistance. If you can help General Cheatham by using your artillery do so. Since writing this, General Hardee has informed General Hood that General Strahl will be placed in the gap between your right and General Cheatham.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. RATCHFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major-General STEVENSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: I am directed by the lieutenant-general commanding to say that there has been no misapprehension whatever of any notes you have sent to these headquarters. His reason for having directed me to send the note he did was with the view of taking one of your brigades to assist General Stewart in case he was attacked south of the Sandtown road. He directed that you will accordingly hold this brigade in readiness for such emergency. He felt that you could hold your present position against any ordinary force, without any need of the reserves. He further directs me to say that he is not at all anxious about your line or General Hindman's, but he is about General Stewart's. He feels the same interest in all parts of the line occupied by his troops.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. RATCHFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
