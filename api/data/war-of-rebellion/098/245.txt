HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Near Goldsborough N. C., March 28, 1865.

MAJOR: I have the honor to respectfully transmit the following report of the operations of my division from the time of leaving Savannah, Ga., in January last, until reaching this point the 24th instant:

In obedience to orders received from Major-General Logan, I left my camp near Savannah on the 10th of January, marching that day to Thunderbolt, the point of embarkation, some eight miles distant. The Seventeenth Army Corps was found to be making use of all the shipping, and it was several days before I obtained control of any of the vessels. In the meantime I constructed two very substantial landings that enabled me to expedite my loading very considerably. It was not until the 17th of January that my entire division was transferred from Thunderbolt of Beaufort, S. C., and its vicinity (one brigade being out at Garden's Corners). While here all possible preparations was rapidly made for the approaching campaign, and on the 27th of January I left Beaufort, marching my two remaining brigades out as far as Garden's Corners, where I remained until the morning of January 30, when I moved forward to McPhersonville. I halted here one day, sending ack to Pocotaligo for additional supplies. Leaving my camp the next morning, February 1, I marched forward in the direction of Hickory Hill Post-Office, skirmishing light with the enemy's cavalry at this point. I had one man wounded in the skirmish at Hickory Hill. Continuing my march now uninterrupted, I reached Buford's Bridge over the Salkehatchie River on the 4th of February. The road here had been much obstructed by the rebels, and before my column reached the river they had evacuated their well-constructed works covering the bridge and river crossing. Moving over the river on the 5th I advanced some four miles, crossing the Little Salkehatchie the next day. On the 7th of February I reached Bamberg, a station on the Charleston and Augusta Railroad, and I immediately, in compliance with instructions received from the major-general commanding, directed one of my brigades, the First, Brevet Major-General Woods commanding, at work tearing up the track and destroying the iron and ties, while the remaining two brigades of my division proceed about one mile north of the village, where I took up an intrenched position, covering the approaches to town from that direction. On the 8th I remained in the position taken near Bamberg, the First Brigade still continuing its work of destroying the railroad. On the morning of February 9 I moved in the direction of Graham's, camping north of the railroad near that p, lace. The Third Brigade, Colonel George A. Stone commanding, was here sent forward to Blackville for the purpose of destroying the railroad in that vicinity. February 10 I remained in camp again, the Second Brigade, Colonel R. F. Catterson commanding, as well as parts of the balance of my command, being engaged in tearing up the railroad all day. Leaving my camp here on the morning of February 12 I continued my march without interruption.

For the movements of the division of the ensuing ten days I respectfully call your attention to the official report rendered by me on the 21st of February when encamped in the vicinity of Longtown, copy herewith inclosed. *

Leaving my camp at the place last mentioned on the morning of February 22, I marched to Peay's Ferry over the Wateree River. Crossing the river on the 23rd, I moved forward by way of West's Cross-Roads
