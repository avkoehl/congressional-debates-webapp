As soon as you can cook three days' bread rations continue the march of your troops to Tupelo, but send all your wheels that can be spared from your troops, including those of your artillery, direct to Columbus, Miss. Let a staff officer move with them, and report to Major-General Elzey upon arriving at Columbus. When you get to Tupelo you will probably move to West Point.
