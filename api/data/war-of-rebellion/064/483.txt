HICKORY PLAINS, June 21, 1864-4 a. m.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I reached Hickory Plains last evening and found Major Drummond here. What rebel force was here had retreated northward on the approach of Major Drummond. I do not think the rebels have had at any one time over 400 men here. Shelby I feel certain is on the other side of White River. Parties of his men are accoutered all over this country. I have no doubt of that, but his main force is on the other side of the river, anywhere between Clarendon, and Jacksonport, I think most likely near Augusta. His conscripts, I am told, are ordered to report at Cotton Plant. I am going to scout the country northward to-day. None of our troops have yet arrived here.

Respectfully,

M. M. TRUMBULL,

Colonel, Commanding.
