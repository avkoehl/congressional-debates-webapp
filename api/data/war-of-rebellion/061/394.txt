officer; Lieutenant Peter French, aide-de-camp; Lieutenant Loring, aide-de-camp; and Lieutenants Bailey and Warren, signal officers, all of my staff, for the conspicuous gallantry and good conduct with which they behaved.

MAJOR: In my letter commencing my staff to the consideration of the major-general commanding I omitted to mention Surg. C. B. Hutchins. One hundred and sixteenth New York, acting medical director First Division. His care of the sick and wounded in both engagements and his conduct on the field were highly praiseworthy.

HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, NINETEENTH ARMY CORPS,Alexandria, La., April 28, 1864.

MAJOR: On the morning of the 23rd instant, at 12 o'clock, after having just completed with my division a march of 40 miles, I received orders from the major-general commanding to march and attack the enemy at Cane River Crossing, and for this purpose he placed at my disposal the following forces: My own division, General Cameron's command, General Birge's command, General Arnold's cavalry command, and his chief of artillery, Captain Closson. the head of the infantry column, consisting of my own division, marched at 4.30 a. m., preceded by the cavalry under General Arnold, Colonel Gooding's brigade leading. In less than 3 miles from Cloutierville the enemy's pickets were encountered, the cavalry was ordered to drive them in and press them until they ascertained the line of battle occupied by the enemy. They skirmished handsomely and briskly, driving in the enemy's pickets until they got to the line of battle occupied by the enemy, which was very strong and defended by two batteries of eight pieces each, which crossed their fire on an open field, through which it was necessary to pass before we could reach the enemy's position. The ground occupied by them, besides being covered with timber, was about some 100 feet higher than that by which we were obliged to approach. This condition of things was partly foreseen before we started and anticipated by the inclosed copy of an order given General Birge. For a sketch of the ground and the position of the troops I inclose a map* by my aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Loring.
