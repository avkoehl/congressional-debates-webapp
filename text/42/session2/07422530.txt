trict, tho attorney of the United States for the Dis-
trict, and the secretary of the District ex officio,
shall compose the Board of Metropolitan Polioo oi
tho District. Tho said chief justice shall be the
president of the board. In his absence a president
pro tenwore may bo elected by the boaid. A majority
of the members shall constitute a quorum to transact
business. Beloro entering upon their duties, the
commissioners shall take and subscribe an oath to
support the Constitution of the United States, and
to perform the duties of their otlioc with fidelity.
Tho board shall have power to appoint the super-
intendent and all other officers of the force, and to
remove any of tho samo for cause.
Sue. ^3. That the act to establish tho policc court

nil acts of Congress, or of the Legislative Assembly
of the District of Columbia, or of the Legislative
Assenibl\ of Maryland, and all British statutes in
force in tho Distiict of Columbia, so far as the same
are inconsistent with this act, are hereby repealed.
Mr. SHERMAN. I move to strike out sec-
tion twenty-two. This section twenty-two
creates a Board of Metropolitan Police, the
whole expense of which is to fall upon the
United States. Several officers, among the
test the chief justice of the District of Co-
lumbia, are appointed as members of the
Metropolitan Police Board. I do not think we
have anything to do with the police of this
District. It strikes me the police of this Dis-
trict ought to be under the Governor of the
District and the legislative authority of the
District.
Mr. CARPENTER. There are on the first
and second pages of this bill at least four un-
constitutional provisions. It providesâ
That said court shall consist of three judges, to
be appointed by the President, by and with the
advice and consent of the Senate.
That is well enough. Thenâ
The clerk shall be appointed by the court, and
shall have the appointment of his assistants. The
bailiffs shall be appointed by the United States
marshal for the District of Columbia.
The United States marshal is neither the
President nor a court of law nor a head of a
Department, and these are the only three
fountains from which an appointment can pro-
ceed under the Constitution, or to which we can
delegate the power.
S"ctioi> three provides that the salary of the
judges shall be Â§13,000 each per annum, &c.
Section four declares " that the judges shall be
selected from the members of the bar of the
District of Columbia, and shall hold office for
the term of six years." There is a sentence of
three lines with two unconstitutional provis-
ions. In the first place, the judges of this court
must hold their office during good behavior,
and they need not be either citizens of the Dis-
trict of Columbia or members of the bar, and
we have no power whatever to restrict the
President to this District in making appoint-
ments to any public office under any act of
Congress. 1 have only looked at these two
sections, and finding tour or five unconstitu-
tional provisions there, I have got discouraged
about the bill and shall vote against it.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. An-
thony in the chair.) The question is on the
amendment of the Senator fiom Ohio, to strike
out the twenty second section of the amend-
ment, in the following words:
Sec. 22. That the President of the United States,
by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,
shall appoint tor the term of four years four resi-
dents of the District of Columbia, at a salary of
$600 per annum, payable quarterly, who, together
with the attorney of the United States lor the Dis-
trict, chief justice of the supreme court of the Dis-
trict, and the secretary of the District ex officio, Miall
compose the Board of Metropolitan Police of the Dis-
trict. The said chief justice shall be the president of
theboard. In liisabsenceapresidentprotoi/poremay
be elected hy the board. A majority of the mem-
bers shall constitute a quorum to transact bu-iuegs.
Before entering upon their duties the commission-
ers ih.t.l 1 take and subscribe an oath to support the
Constitution ot the United States and to perform the
duties of their oflico with lidelity. The board shall
have power to appoint the superintendent and all
other officers of the force, and to remove any of the
same for cause.
The amendment to the amendment wa.s
agreed to.
Mr. HAMLIN. To obviate one of the ob-
jections made by the Senator from Wisconsin,
1 move to strike out in section four, after the
word "from," in the first line, to the word
"and," in the second line, the words "mem-
bers of the bar of the District of Columbia;"
so that we shall not attempt, to limit, the Presi-
dent in his action, as we have no right to do.
We might as well undertake to say that he
shall appoint a judicial officer from a certain
county, or a cerlam town, or a certain district.
Mr. SAWYER. I have no objection what-
ever to that amendment; but if the criticism
of the Senator from Wisconsin is correct, the
amendment should be extended to strikeout
the provision which limits the term of office.
I would suggest an amendment to the amend-
ment by saying " during good behavior," in-
stead of " for the term of six years ;" so that
the sentence would read :
That the judges shall hold office during good be
havior, and one of them shall be designated in his
commission as tho presiding judge.
lhe PRESIDING OFFICER, Does the
Senator from Maine accept the amendment
suggested by the Senator from South Caro-
lina? 'Ihe whole proposition is an amend-
ment, and therefore is not amendable beyond
the second degree.
Mr. SAWYER. I thought that placed this
substitute in the position of au original bill
for puiposes of convenience.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair
was not aware of that.
Mr. SUMNER. I inquire of the Senator in
charge ot this bill whether he accepts tue in-
terpretation put by the Senator from Wiscon-
sin on that, provision, and regards it, as uncon-
stitutional? By the laws of Congress there is
a limitation upon appointments to various
offices. For instance, postmasters must, reside
m the town for which they are appointed.
Mr. CARPENIER. I think the Senator is
mistaken about that.
Mr. SUMNER. No. There may not be a
general provision, but there is a piovision I
know applicable to certain towns.
_ Mr. CARPEN TER. There may he a pro-
vision of law that, after the man is appointed,
he shall reside m the town where the office is,
but there is no provision of law, 1 think, that
