The SPEAKER said, yes
In reply to an ínquiiy from Mr  CARTJTHERS—
The fePEAlCLRbaid tint if themouonto stuke out prevail

Mr BRIGGS    Then a vo e to amend the journal m the way

Tne SPEAKER interponed and requested th*  gentleman

turn before the Hou«e, on the notion to cone¡ t ¡he lomnai
Mr BOTTS was speaking, he said of'fu, d gmtv and chat

Mr B@nt^sail th tt the tieK In J not tianspirel is entered
onthej uirnal,    By the journal, it appeared, thu tluse íesolu
tion^ had been received by the House, and ordered to be en
tered on ihejourmil It was a violation of the rule adopted on
motion of the gentleman fiom Massachusetts, [Mr Ar>\Ms]
That rule was confined expiessly to petitions The Speaker
had, in hisjudgment, no light to decide whether these resolu-
tions should be received If these resolutions were received,
wl ich involved a censme of this House, and defamed the chi
lactfi of the House, there was no species of resolutions, how
evei lnfi-tmmatoiy m their chaiaetei, that could not be entered
oi the journal
Did the gentleman from Ohio [Mi Goode] rise m h s place,
openly and aboveboaid, and aak that thefee resolutiors might be
entered on thejouinal'1 No He walked up to the Cle'k's ta
ble, without the knowledge of a single membei of this body
Mi B was proceeding to show that it wa-3 due to the dignity
of the body that they should not penr it themselves to beUius
censured—(hat they should receive no resolution, coming from
anyquirtu, which involved aceusuie of the proceedings of
this Hou&e, or defamatoiy to the characterof the House, <tnd
he was about to show that this was not the only instance oí it If
it was not due to the Northern men tl at ihey should protect
their own dignity and character, he held it due to the membei s
fi om the South , uid he was about to move [pointing to a gen
tteman who holds a sear at one of tt e desks allotted to reporter,
on the left of the Speaker's chau] for the expulsion of that
man, who held a seat by com tesy in this House, and employed
himself in defaming it, and characterizing one portion of the
House a¡> dough faces and slaveb he alluded to the editoi of the
E nancipa'^rand Tree American—a paper which he received
íeKulaily, he knew not how li tins House chose to íeceive
such a resolution as that, presented in such a iorm, and to
spread it on the journal, it was not for him to censure the
House font But he hoped iheie would be found members
enough to understand what wo5 due toiheirpharacter, to strike
thesj resolutions fiom the journal, and then to expel those men
who came here, not foi reporting its proceedings, but ioi the
pmpo-e of defaming its membeis
Mi GOODE of Ohio, said tie did not come here to contiol
