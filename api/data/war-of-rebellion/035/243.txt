Major General RICHARD J. OGLESBY,

Commanding Left Wing, Sixteenth Army Corps, Jackson, Tenn.:

GENERAL: The following telegram has just been received:

MURFREESBOROUGH, April 12, 1863.

General HURLBUT:

Colonel Streigth, with near 2,000 picked men, will probably reach Eastport by Thursday next. Dodge, with the Marine Brigade and the gunboats, can occupy or whip the Tuscumbia forces, and let my forces go directly to the main object-the destruction of the railroads. This is a great enterprise, fraught with great consequences. I beg you to commend to Dodge care, enjoining on him to dispatch Streight by every means to his destination. Nothing, if possible, should for a moment arrest his progress.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

General Dodge will act according to the instructions in the above telegram.

By order of Major-General Hurlbut:

There are a lot of soldiers belonging to this command at Nashville and vicinity, some skulking and some have go themselves detailed, &amp;c., producing a very demoralizing effect on this command. Will you please give me an order so I can get these men whenever I can find them?

GEORGE CROOK,

Brigadier-General.

HEADQUARTERS, Cincinnati, April 16, 1863.

General HORATIO G. WRIGHT:

Your position for movement of cavalry to Celina and Burkesville is approved, but I think the number of men should be larger. Send the whole cavalry force from Lebanon as near to Columbia as possible, and order all the country scoured in the direction of Creelsborough and
