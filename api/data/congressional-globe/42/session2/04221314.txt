Mr. SUMNER. Mr. President, as rny name
dming t.lui late debate has been mentioned
more than once as a possible member of the
special committee that hag been ordered to
inquire into the sale of arms and oven as the
chairman of the committee, I deem it my duty
to say now in advance that the condition of
my health is such that it would be impossible
for me to serve on that committee. [ make
this statement with reluctance, and the Sen-
ate will pardon me if I add certain details.
It may be remembered by personal friends
that just a year ago f was suddenly arrested
in my duties by very painful symptoms which
were traced to injuries received sixteen years
ago, quickened anew by overwork. At that
time the physician who made himself ac-
quainted with my case enjoined repose. I
have been sorry to lind during the last two
days a recurrence of some of those painful
symptoms, and my physician to whom 1 felt it
my duty to appeal ttns morning besides medi-
cal treatment has again enjoined repose. I
have his presciiption and mandate to that
effect. Under the circumstances 1 feel it my
duty to obey, but with infinite regret. I am
not in the habit, as Senators will bear witness,
of neglecting or avoiding labor. For the pres-
ent 1 must content myself with the discharge
of my ordinary duties without undertaking
anything new.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I wish to say that, I am
reported in the Globe as having said last
night, in reply to a suggestion of the Senator
from Ohio [Mr. Sherman] that the Chair
appoint this committee, that I made objection
to any appointment, or something to that
effect, at the present time. I ought to say,
in justice to myself and to the Chair, that I
understood my friend from Ohio to move the
ordinary resolution, that, if the Chair did not
appoint, such and such gentlemen should be
the committee; and it was to that that I was
objecting, as 1 understood it, and not to the
Chair's making the appointment.
credentials.
The VICE PRESIDENT presented the cre-
dentials of Hon Aaron A. Sargent, chosen by
the Legislature of California a Senator from
that State for the term commencing March 4,
1873 ; which were read, and ordered to be filed.
executive communications.
The VICE PRESIDENT laid before the
Senate a report of the Secretary of War, trans-
mitting a copy of the report of Major W. E.
Merrill, of the corps of engineers, upon the
survey of the harbor at Evansville, Indiana ;
which was referred to the Committee on Com-
merce, and ordered to be printed.
He also laid before the Senate a report of
the Secretary of War, concerning the necessity
for a connecting line of telegraph between
important military posts in the military division
of the South; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs, and ordered to be
printed.
sale of public property in maine.
The VICE PRESIDENT laid before the
Senate the amendment of the House of Rep-
resentatives to the bill (S. No. 475) to authorize
the sale of public property at Houlton, Maine.
The amendment of the House of Represent-
atives was to strike out all after the enacting
clause, and insert the following:
That the Secretary of War bo, and ho is hereby,
authorized to sell and convey the land and building
belonging to the United States at Houlton, Maino,
known as Hancock barracks, if. in his opinion, it
shall bo for tho interest of tho Government, to sell
the same, rosorvine to tho county of Aroostook so
much ot' said land as shall be necessary for tho mon-
uments thereon erected, by the consent of tho War
Department, to establish a meridian lino,which land
shall bo granted to said county: Provided, That tho
land so granted shall not oxceed in value tho sum
of #500.
Mr. HAMLIN. Thatis substantially the bill
already passed by the Senate, with a limitation,
and I hope the Senate will agree to tho House
amendment. I move that the Senate concur
in that amendment.
Tho motion was agreed to.
proposed adjournment over.
Mr. SPENCER. I move that when tho
Senate adjourns to-day, it adjourn to meet on
Monday next.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I hope not.
Mr. COLE. That is a debatable motion, I
believe.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It is.
Mr. COLE. I do not wish to debate it,
however, but simply to express my anxiety
that the Senate may continue in session to-
morrow. To-day we shall probably enter upon
the consideration of the appropriation bill
which has been partly considered, and if we
arc permitted to go on with it to-morrow, in all
probability we shall get through with it, and
then it will be out of the way of some other
business, other business being pressing.
Mr. SHERMAN. I hope this motion will
be allowed to go over until we get through
with the morning business.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If any Senator
objects, tho morning business must be first
disposed of, and the motion can be made again
duirng the morning hour when there is no other
business before the Senate, but the morning
business now has priority.
Mr. SPENCER. I should like to reply to
the Senator from California.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It is not debat-
able at the present time.
Mr. SHERMAN. All I ask is that it shall
go over until after the morning business is
disposed of.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Objection being
made, the morning business must be proceeded
with.
petitions and memorials.
The VICE PRESIDENT presented a reso-
lution of the Legislature of Louisiana, in favor
of the passage of the supplementary civil rights
bill; which was ordered to lie on the table, and
ordered to be printed.
Mr. WEST presented a memorial of the
New Orleans, Florida, and Havana Steamship
Company, indorsed by sixteeninsurance com-
panies and the Chamber of Commerce of New
Orleans, asking an appropriation for the im-
provement of the channel at the port of Cedar
Keys, in Florida ; which was referred to the
Committee on Commerco.
Mr. SHERMAN. I present a petition
numerously signed by prominent citizens of
Cincinnati, praying that whatever changes be
made in the tariff' laws they shall not take
effect within one hundred and eighty days,
and setting out their reasons therefor. And
here I desire to state that the passage of the
House bill repealing the duties on tea and
coffee has created great alarm throughout, the
country in regard to the action of the Senate.
The immediate passage of any sudden change
so important as that would work great injury
to the trade throughout the country, and great
excitement has sprung up in the commercial
cities in regard to it. 1 desire now to state that
whatever differences of opinion there may be
in regard to repealing the duty on tea and
coffee, there is no expectation, so far as I
know, by any Senator, and certainly not by
any member of the Committee on Finance,
that the act will take effect before the 1st of
July, so that all the alarm, which is evidenced
by the large delegations here yesterday, and
also by the petitions that will be coming in
now, is, I think, unfounded. There is no •
doubt that whatever action is had by Congress
will be postponed to a day certain, and that,
every one will have an opportunity to adapt
himself and his business to the changes pro-
posed in the tariff.
I think it due to the business men of the
country to make this statement, and I make
it on behalf of the Committee on Finance,
who unanimously concur in the opinion.
The VICE PRESIDENT. This petition
will be referred to that committee.
Mr. SCOTT. Before that petition is referred
I desire to say a word. While I agree with
the chairman of the Committee on Finance
that it is not only proper, but desirable, that
whatever change be made in reference to the
duties on tea and coffee shall not go into effect
for some months after the law shall have been
enacted, I wish to make the further statement
that the parties whose business is very much
affected by the pendency of this question felt
satisfied that it would relieve them very much
if the sense of the Senate itself, in addition to
that of the Committee on Finance, could have
been had separately upon that bill repealing
the duties on tea and coffee. I myself, as a
member of the Committee on Finance, desired
that the sense of the Senate might be taken
on that bill; but satisfied as I am that the
introduction of any bill repealing the duty on
tea and coffee, or upon any other single article,
would inevitably lead to the offering of such
amendments as would be equivalent to bring-
ing on the whole subject, 1 have deemed it
better that the decision of the question should
await the time when the whole subject can
come up; otherwise, I would have desired that
that bill should be reported for the immediate
action of the Senate.
Mr. SHERMAN presented a petition of
citizens of Ohio, late soldiers in the United
States Army, praying for the passage of an
act authorizing a bounty of §8 33|- per month
for the time served, after deducting all Gov-
ernment bounty heretofore received by them,
and that the act of July 15, 1870, relating to
the entry of public lands be amended ; which
was ordered to lie on the table.
He also presented a memorial of citizens
of Ohio, praying that the duties on wool may
