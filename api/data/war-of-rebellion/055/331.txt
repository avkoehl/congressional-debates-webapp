HEADQUARTERS ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH CORPS,Lookout Valley, Tennessee, November 24, 1863.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD,

Chief of Staff.

Not a man has been removed from the picket line of our camp to-day. It is the same line we have had since General Howard left, and I desire it to be held by those men. Have you any reports of the cavalry sent out in the direction of Trenton? On the receipt of this they must be instructed to keep well out and on the aleret night and day. You will also direct an officer and a company of men from the regiment holding the right of General Geary's picket linen to proceed at once and destroy the bridge effectually by which General Geary crossed Lookout Creek in the vicinity of Wauhatchie this morning. I want the name of the officer intrusted with this duty, for him to report by letter when he has executed it.

Very respectfully,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.

Brigadier-General CRUFT:

Major-General Hooker directs that as soon as the enemy are started our forces pursue to the crest of Lookout Slope only, where the lines will be formed. Pursue no farther than the crest without further orders. The bridges are to be made perfect after the troops have passed.

Very respectfully,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,
