HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

August 4, 1863-9 p. m. {Received 11 p. m.}

Major General H. W. HALLECK,
General-in-Chief:

Matters remain much the same as reported yesterday. A reconnaissance by the cavalry on the right proves the abandonment of the line of the Hedgman's River, hitherto held by the enemy's pickets, our cavalry crossing without opposition at Rixeyville, and meeting no enemy until within 2 miles of Culpeper, when they encountered a superior cavalry force about 4 p. m. The enemy attacked Buford in front of Rappahannock railroad crossing with cavalry and artillery. They were readily repulsed by Buford, and driven for some distance, until, being without orders to advance, he saw no object in continuing the pursuit. Two deserters who came in to-day from Longstreet's corps, who left their regiment yesterday, report that their corps was on the march Orange Court-House, and that Hill's corps followed Longstreet. Ewell is understood to be in the vicinity of Madison Court-House. This information confirms the cavalry reports and the signals from Watery Mountain. I am of the opinion that the movement of Buford on Saturday was considered an advance, and that Lee has withdrawn his infantry behind the Rapidan. I shall make no further movements without your instructions, except to occupy as much of the ground between the Rappahannock and Rapidan by my cavalry as I can without requiring too great and unnecessary loss on my part.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
