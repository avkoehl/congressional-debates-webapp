the city and await events, where I arrived yesterday. This morning we hear that you have succeeded in saving the gun-boats and are on your way down to Simsport. This news, together with the favorable news just received from the East, has thrown the loyal population here into a state of highest gratification, I assure you. It has been a source of deep regret to me that I was unable to promptly obey your order, and the stopping of the communications was alone the cause of my not reaching Alexandria.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
