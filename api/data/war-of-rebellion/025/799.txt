General PEMBERTON,

Grenada:

The following telegram just received:

COLUMBUS, December 17, 1862.

Captain HOOE:

Copy of dispatch:

"EGYPT, 16th.

"Colonel ADAMS:

"Force of 300 which burned Shannon Depot was from Oxford and has returned. Force stationary at Tupelo, 2, 500 infantry, nine pieces of artillery, and some cavalry; force at Pontotoc probably 1,000 cavalry, with artillery, not advancing, but ravaging country. I do not think their demonstration is now threatening to Columbus, though such may have been their original intention. I retreated to this place last night, the better to counteract any possible movement by way of Fulton and Aberdeen, and also apprehending attack from Pontotoc. I need more cavalry.

"BARTEAU,
