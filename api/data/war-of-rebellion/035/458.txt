HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Hoover's Gap, June 25, 1863-3 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: Dispatch of 1 p. m. received. I have been to the front myself. The enemy apparently have but one brigade on Fairfield road; either a part or one brigade on Manchester pike, beyond Beech Grove. Has not attempted to drive us; therefore I think he is acting on the defensive. I propose concentrating my corps here this p. m., and making an advance at daylight to-morrow on Fairfield and Manchester pike; Rousseau on Manchester, and Reynolds and Brannan on Fairfield; Negley in reserve, if you approve.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND,In the Field, Big Spring Branch, June 25, 1863-Midnight.

Major-General THOMAS:

The general commanding directs you to throw forward such part of your force as you may deem sufficient to threaten Fairfield, and create the impression that you design an attack Manchester by way of Matt's Hollow. It will be best to send your mounted brigade around by McBrigade's Branch to the head of Matt's Hollow, and thus facilitate the taking of that defile. Make as much of the distance to Manchester as possible to-morrow. After 2 o'clock to-morrow, department headquarters will be at Beech Grove.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

P. S.-The general suggests that it may be best to send your trans around to Manchester by way of McBrigade's Branch. It would greatly facilitate your advance. General McCook will follow you.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Big Spring Branch, June 25, 1863-9.50 a. m.

Brigadier General H. P. VAN CLEVE,

Commanding Fortress Rosecrans:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs you to open communication with General Granger, who is now at Christiana, on the Shelbyville pike. Tell him we have not heard from him since last evening.
