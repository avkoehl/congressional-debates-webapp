FORT ANDERSON, January 22, 1865-1.30 p. m.

Colonel ARCHER ANDERSON, Assistant Adjutant-General:

The fleet apparently stopped about one-half or three-quarters of a mile this side of Battery Lamb; in all, some seventeen armed vessels; none that can be called iron-clads. All have steam up. There seems to be a large number of troops collected at the extreme end of Confederate Point. No change reported yet on land on this side of the river.

LOUIS HEBERT,

Brigadier-General.

FEET ANDERSON, January 22, 1865-4.30 p. m.

Colonel ANDERSON, Assistant Adjutant-General:

At 2 p. m. one vessel of the enemy moved up neared and fired seven shots at Fort Anderson, apparently 100-pounder Parrott shells. One struck warehouse at landing. In response we fired six shots at her from 12-pounder Whitworh. The vessel has now retired to the position of the fleet.

LOUIS HEBERT,

Brigadier-General.

FORT ANDERSON, January 22, 1865-6.30 p. m.

Colonel ANDERSON, Assistant Adjutant-General:

All quiet now. Fleet in position just above Battery Lamb. I have no information of landing of troops on the western side. I have no news to-day form eastern side.

LOUIS HEBERT,

Brigadier-General.

ANDERSON, January 22, 1865.

Colonel ANDERSON, Assistant Adjutant-General:

At this hour, 7.15 p. m., all is quiet. I have not been able to ascertain the number of troops which the enemy may have landed at west side of river. No force of consequence is at Battery Lamb. It is supposed about 1,000 men are at Smithville. The enemy may throw forces over at any time, with their facilities, and protect positions of their fleet.

LOUIS HEBERT,

Brigadier-General.
