been cut off from the main body. Reports hearing firing all the evening in direction of Williamsburg. Our forces are in hot pursuit. The rebels are desperate, and are burning everything in their retreat.

GEO. W. NEFF,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

CINCINNATI, July 16, 1863.

Colonel NEFF:

The cavalry that was sent here went back to your post to-day. You must keep them well out, and if any rebels are now in Clemont County they ought to be caught.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, July 16, 1863.

Colonel NEFF, Camp Dennison:

How far do your scouts extend out in the direction of Williamsburg, and how far toward the Ohio?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, OHIO, July 16, 1863.

Operator at Leesburg:

We will see what we can do to relieve you. Send a reliable messenger through Hillsborough to meet General Hobson near Sardinia, and inform him that the roads near the Scioto will be blockaded, and a heavy force is moving up the Ohio to prevent Morgan crossing. It is, therefore, very important that he push hard after him. Do not put this in writing, but get a messenger intelligent enough to carry it verbally, and who will go through with speed.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.

JULY 16, 1863.

Colonel RUNKLE, Chillicothe, Ohio:

What amount of force have you, and have you any artillery? Morgan's advance was at Locust Grove last night. I think he will try to go out by way of Portsmouth, but he may make up toward your place. Keep a good watch.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

JULY 16, 1863.

Captain FITCH (or commander of any gunboat near Maysville):

I am fearful that Morgan may turn on our men, and try cross at or below Maysville. You will, of course, look to them.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
