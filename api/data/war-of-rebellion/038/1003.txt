I respectfully suggest that some arrangement be made by which the dead of the enemy can be buried without allowing their burial party to come within the line of my skirmishers.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE.

[Indorsement Numbers 1.]Major-General BRECKINRIDGE, Commanding,&amp;c.,:

GENERAL: General Johnston directs me to ask of you what arrangements you propose to effect the object you propose in your letter. This letter is returned, as you may not have retained a copy, and may wish to refer to it in recommending any arrangement.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. S. EWELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Indorsement, Numbers 2.] Colonel EWELL, Assistant Adjutant-General.

COLONEL: The only mode that occurs to me is for the general to send a flag to the enemy, requesting him not to fire on my burial parties. I think we can bury them in two or three hours. My chief surgeon reports that the offensive smell has caused some sickness, and that it is important to have them buried.

Respectfully,

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE.
HEADQUARTERS ADAMS' BRIGADE, July 14, 1863.

Colonel John A. BUCKNER, Asst. Adjt. General, Breckinridge's DIVISION:

COLONEL: At this hour, 2. 14 p. m., I am in receipt of the order for burying the enemy's dead by 4 p. m., and have taken steps to have it promptly executed. The time is short if, as it seems, the labor is devolved upon my command. No work is progressing from other commands, but large crowds of idlers, &c., are on the ground. I have appointed Lieutenant Colonel Leon Von Zinken to see to the execution of this order.

Respectfully,DANIEL W. ADAMS.
HEADQUARTERS, Jackson, MISS., July 14, 1863

Captain I. N. BROWN, C. S. NAVY:

SIR: If it is necessary to abandon the Yazoo country, you will destroy all steamboats and public property to the extent of your means.

By command of General Johnston:

BENJ. S. EWELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

JACKSON, July 14, 1863.

General CHALMERS, Panola, MISS.:

Your command is extended to include Yazoo City and its vicinity. Hold your troops in readiness to move east, if it becomes necessary destroying railroad bridges and rolling-stock.

J. E. Johnston.
