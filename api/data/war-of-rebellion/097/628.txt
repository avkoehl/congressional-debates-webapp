Each division commander will send out a foraging party under a good and judicious officer to obtain supplies to-day from the country-cattle and breadstuff. This is done in anticipation of the supplies not reaching the corps to-night. A proper amount of food will be left with each family. Care will be taken that only such supplies are taken as can be used by the troops and are necessary.
