Enemy drove in our pickets to Bunker Hill this morning at 4 o'clock. Firing heard also on Tuscarora road. Cannot re-enforcements be sent here and North Mountain?

(Received 9. 55 p. m.)

Brigadier-General CULLUM, Chief of Staff:

A telegram just received from General Sullivan reports all quiet below. The scare this morning was caused by a squad of rebel cavalry near Winchester. I am now satisfied there are no rebel troops north of Mount Jackson, except, perhaps, a few scouts. The baltimore and Ohio Railroad is thoroughly protected, and perfectly safe for passengers and freight.

J. W. GARRETT, Esq.,

President Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Baltimore:

The reports that the enemy were approaching the railroad in large force with the view of again destroying the bridges, capturing trains, is unfounded. The railroad is well guarded and thoroughly protected, and is perfectly safe for both freight and passengers.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel MULLIGAN, New Creek:

Our pickets were driven in near Martinsburg this a. m. Give notice here on the railroad. It is reported to me that Enrights was seen near Moorefield with his company a day or two since.

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH DIVISION,Martinsburg, January 1, 1864.

Brigadier-General KELLEY, Cumberland:

I have not much confidence in the pickets of the Twelfth Pennsylvania, who brought in the report that they captured 4 prisoners 4 miles this side of Winchester at 4 o'clock this morning; that the prisoners were subsequently recaptured by 30 rebels, who pursued the scouts of the Twelfth Pennsylvania to Bunker Hill; also that the prisoners had stated that two brigades arrived at Winchester
