Sweeting, late pilot of the United States steamer
Juniata, have directed me to rejfbrt it back with-
out amendment and recommend its passage. It
merely provides for the claim of a colored man
for piloting our vessels, and I ask for its present
consideration.

mittee of the Whole, proceeded to consider the
joint resolution, which authorizes the Secretary \

thony Sweeting, late pKot of the United States

without amendment, ordered to a third reading,
read the third time, and passed.
PUNISHMENT OF GUERRILLAS.
Mr. SUMNER. While we were in executive
session 1 was called to the door by the Secretary
of the interior, who asked me and urged me very
strenuously not to allow a bill that has passed
the House of Representatives which is on our
Calendar, and which was reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations in this body, to fail
to be acledupon. ltis House billNo.552. 11will
take but two minutes.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I hope that bill will not
be taken up.
Mr. SUMNER. Why not?
Mr. TRUMBULL. Because I desire to make
a report from a committee of conference, and there
are several reports of that character to be made.
Mr. SUMNER. I know of none.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The Senator's colleague
wishes to make one. Because the Senator fiotn
Massachusetts has not any to make, he seems to
suppose there is no such business to be done. I
trust that these reports from committees of con-
ference will be disposed of before we take up
other business. 1 as>k the consent of the Senate
to make a report from a committee of conference.
The PRESI DING OFFICER,(Mr. Foster in
the chair.) There is a motion before the Senate.
The report can be received only by unanimous
consent.
Mr. SUMNER. Let mc pass my bill first.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I shall not agree to it. If
you can get a majority of the Senate you can do
it, not otherwise. â€¢*
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion
before the Senate is that the Senate proceed to the
consideration of House bill No. 552. The Sen-
ator from Illinois, pending the motion, asks unan-
imous consent to make a report from a commit-
tee of conference.
Mr. SUMNER. Very well; I yield to the
Senator from Illinois. 1 do not wish to make a
battle on a small matter. This is a bill that I
have been tiying to get up for two or three days,
and, as I said, the Secretary of the Interior has
come to our door to-day especially to remind me
of it.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no
objection, the report of the committee of confer-
ence will be received.
Mr. CONNESS. I have no objection, if it
shall not be undcistood that the floor is still held
by the Senator from Massachusetts.
Mr. SUMNER. Oh, I hold nothing; I do not
understand that I hold anything.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The committee of con-
ference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses
on House bill No. 511 have instructed nie to make
the following report:
The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of
