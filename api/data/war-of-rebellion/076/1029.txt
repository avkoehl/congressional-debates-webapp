SEPTEMBER 7, 1864.

Major General M. L. SMITH,

Chief Engineer:

You will proceed to Macon with a view to taking immediate steps for placing it in a state of defense. As soon as may be, you will then visit Augusta, and afterward Columbus, Ga., to see what works or changes in the works are required at these last points. The commanding officers of the places named will afford you wall possible facilities to enable these instructions to be carried into effect.

Chief of Staff.]

SEPTEMBER 7, 1864.

General IVERSON,

Commanding Cavalry:

General Hood directs that you move your command to Stockbridge, and take position at or near that place. You will exercise command of all of the cavalry east of the railroad. Your command will consist of General Morgan's and Colonel Hannon's forces, in addition to your present command. Your line will extend from the railroad to such point to the east as may be necessary to thoroughly observe the enemy and to prevent him, as far as possible, from getting supplies in the country.

[F. A. SHOUP,

Chief of Staff.]

MACON, September 7, 1864.

General BRAGG:

Dispatch received. Vigorous measures have already been taken here to arrest stragglers, and orders issued requiring every man to be in some organization. Your orders will be strictly enforced, and weekly reports made. Accounts of stragglers from Army of Tennessee are much exaggerated. Governor Harris and other reliable parties from there report the army in good condition.

MARCUS J. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,September 7, 1864.

Major-General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: The order for your moving back to the army is repeated. The destruction as you return of railroad and wagon trains is important, if not attended with too much risk.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. A. SHOUP,

Chief of Staff.
