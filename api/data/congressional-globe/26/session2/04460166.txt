notable members to whom I could point on this
floor. If you say the Abolitionists are not to
blame for the treatment of negroes in the non-
shwebolding States, because they are a minority, I
askpgara, where slumbers the power of those ma
joríties to Which I have pointed1 It their majori-
ties ¿0 not extend over the State* where they exist,at
leastthey extend over the Congressional districts from
wKicK these gentlemen are returned; and if they
cannot control the legislation of the whole State,
they certainly are competent to model their own I
society, and give a tone and direction to public
opiwoiL within the limits of their private circ es,
which are sufficiently wide to afford an asylum
for their favorite and oppressed people. Many,
nay most of the oppressions of which this abolí- \
tion author complains, are wholly independent of
legislation, and depend entirely upon public opinion
in their counties and towns, and upon the "customs
ofsociety." On the other hand let no man suppoüs
that I complain of this treatment of tbe negro. No,
sir, it is not my business to interfere in that mailer
at all; I only seize en the fact as it stands stated by an
Jlbolilionhf, and hold it up tti contrast Kith their
claims on the Sou'h, and thtit professions. The only
complaint I havs against these fanatics is, not their
relations with tbeirown negroes, but their presump-
tuous attempts to m'erfere in our domestic relations.
They might treat their own negroes as they please—
free or enslave them, elevate or oppress them, and
we should never open our mouthsabout ii; but when
they volunteer to regulate ourconduct to our lavet,
they give rae a right, which I shall exerene, of
exhibiting them as men who have neither principle
nor consistency, as men who are willing and
anxious to impose on their neighbor?, that which
they Will not take practically to themselves. It is to
these violent abolition crusaders, then, who hare
the power in their own neighborhoods to elevate the
condition of their negroes and who are in the
habit of taunting the South with slavery, and to
no o e else, that I make the charge of inconsis-
tency and hypocrisy. And for that puipose,
with the permisiion of the House, I will p'oeeed
to read, from a pamdhlet written by Mr. Jay.
The author classes the disabilities of the free
negroes in the non-slavehoidmg States under ten
heads. 1st. " Exclusion from the elective fran-
chise" 2d. Denial of the right of locomo-
tiow. 3d. Denial of the right of petition.
4th. Exclusion from the armí and militia. 5ih.
ExCumok from all participados in the admi-
nistration op justice, 6th. Impediments to
education. 7th. Impediments to religious in-
struction 8th Impediments to bos^st indus-
try 9th. LlAB L1TY 10 J3E S1.I71.D AND TREATPD
AS SLAVES. 10th. SUBJECT  TO 1ST ULT AW OUT-
RAGE. It i« worthy of remark that Mr. Jay charges
and attributes, all these exclusion--, impediments
and liabilities, to the Jlboluiomsls themselves, con-
stantly using in the cour e of his. remarks the pro-
nouns "toe" and " our " He an Abolitionist,
writing to Abolitionists, charges himself and his
co-Uborers with what, in his eye, is a crying sin,
and to my apprehension is glaring inconsistency,
and consummate hypocnty
lie says in his prefaratory remarks, speaking of
prejudice against color.
" Were we lo inquire into the geography of this piejudice we
should find that the localities in which it attains its rankest lux
uriance, are not the nrt swamps ot Gioisia nor the sugar fie) Is
of Louisiana, hut the lulls ind valleys of r>ew Kngtand, and the
prattles of Ohio? It mi fict of acknowlejsed njtoriety, that
however severe may be the lawsagainst colored people at the
South, the preptdi e ac wist heir persons is far weaker than
among ourselves "
"We turn to the fiet States, when slavery has not directly
steeled our heana against humin suft ring, and wheie no sup
posed danger of insurrection affoids a ptetext for keeping the
free-blacks in ignorance and degradation, and we ask, what is
the character ofthe prejudice against c >!or here} Let the Uev
ifr Bacon, of Connecticut, answer the question ftusgtntle
man, on a vindication of he Colonization Societv assures us,
'TheSoodra is not farther separate i from the IÍ ahim m regard
to all his privileges, civil lncllectuil and mor i!, than the rie
gro from the while man by the t rem In 5 winch result from the
difference; made between mem by the U on or N A reus "
If we are to believe Mr. Jay, the mt>mb*r from
Ohio and all hs fellow, -laborers entero n a deep-
rooted, implacable «prejuiic? against color," and yel
he would impose on us the very thing he so strenu-
ously rejecs.   What even-banded justice!               ¡
Now, let us see how these advocates of "human
rights" practise on the right of suffrage. The author
proceeds-
]    GENERAL EXCLUSION PROM THE ELECT!/E FRANCHISE
'Were this exclusion founded on tne want of propel ty, or any
other qualification deemed essential to the judicious exercise of
the franchise, it would afford no just cause of complaint but it
is founded solely on the color of the skiti, and is therefore irra
tional and unjust That taxation and representation should be
inseparable, was one oí the axioms ofthe fatheis of our Revolu
tion, and one of thereason3 they assigned for their levolt fiom
the crown of Britain But now, It is deemed a mat k offanatt
cism to complain of the disfranchisement of a whole race, while
they remain subject to the bin den of taxation It is Yiorthy of
remark, that of the thirteen original States, only two were so re
creant to the principles of the Revolution, as to make a white
skin a qualification for suffrage But the prejudice has grown
with our growth, and strengthened with oui strength, an 4 it is
believed that in every State Constitution subsequently fotmed
01 revised, [excepting those of Vermont and Maine, and the le
vised Constitution of Massachusetts ] the crime 01 adatlt com
plexloh has heen punished, by debarung its possessor ft om all
approach to the ballot box The necessary effect of this pro
scnption m aggravating the oppression and degradation of the
coloted inhabitants, must be obvious to all who call to mind the
solicitude manifested by demagogues, and nfhee seekus, and
law makers, topiopitiate the goodwill of all who have votes to
bestow *
2   DENIAL OF THE RIGHT OF LOCOMOTION
"The Connecticut Black Act, prohibiting, under heavy pe
nalties the introduction of any colored peisun/rom another
State, is well known "
demalof the prayer, but «.^expulsion of the petition itself, as
an intruder into the House 'The question piesented for our
decision,' said one of the members, 'is simply thi  Shall hu.
man beings, who are bound by every enactment upon cur sta-
tute book, be permitted lorequest the I egtslature to modify or
soften the laws under which they live?' To the Grand Sultan,
ciowded with petitions as he traverses the streets of Constanti
nople, such a question would teem most strange, but American
Democrats can exeit atyianny over men whohave noiotes,
utteily unknown to Tuikish despotism Mr Flood's motion
was lost by a majority of only Join votes, but this triumph of
humanity and Re inhlic tmsm wu as transient as it was meagre
The next clay the House, by a large majority, resolved 'that the
blacks and mulattoet. who may be residents within this "State,
have no constitutional right to present their petitions to the Ge
neial Assembly foi any purpose whatsoever and that any re
cepuon of such petitions on the part oí the General Assembly
is a meieactoi privilege or policy, and not imposed by any ex
pressed or implied power of the Constitution ' "
Why, sir, this is the language we hold—that
blocks and mulattoes have no right to present their
petitions to the General Assembly—for the ho'ding
of which we have been subjected to unmeasured
vituperation and abuse by the very men who prac-
tically adopt our views,
^th    "EXCLUSION FROM  THE ARMY AND MILITIA
"7*0 such an absurd extent is this pre/udtc against color
carried that some of our military companies have refused
to march to the sound of a drum when beaten by a black
man "
This is going a little ahead of the South, for al-
though a colored man never thinks of entering our
"ranks," we very seldom have any body else to beat
our drums but negroes But the liberty-loving
member from Ohio, it seems, will not march to the
sound of a drum when beaten by his favorite part
of creation, a black man'

6tll    ' IMPEDIMENTS TO EDt CATION
After relating an amusing and edifying ins'ance
of the destruction of a school house in Canaan,
New Hampshire, upon the ground that it was to
be devoted to the use, indiscriminately, of blacks
and whites, (200 cxen were hitched 10 it, and it
was dragged a quarter of a mile, and left in ruins,)

terms the deej and setjled hostility felt in the free States to the
education ofthe hlacks The p>ejudices n* the community

Now, sir, if I bid bef n present at ihe abatement
of this universal scheol house, I ihmk it probable
I hould have taken a hand in it myfelf. But
«here were the Aboluiomsts? They wer  strong
enough to bjild the house and establish the school.
Why did thev not defenl 11? Did they slink away
from their premises at the first breath of opposition?
Mr Jay says not one word of any attempt on their
part to regenerate public opinion, or to remodel
the "customs ofsociety" in that patriotic and spirited
neighborhood Tbey might at least have made an
effort that way to =ave themselves from the re-
proach of inconsistency They are now, and have
been for years past, engaged in a crusade egamst
the South, and in denouncing the customs of our so-
ciety with regard to our alleged degradation of the
negro Ought they not to have comrrenced opera-
tions at their own doors first, upon the principle
that chat ity should begin at hnmt'1 We hold our
"slaves" precisely « here tbey ought to be—m sub-

ness and supported in their old age; they are in-
structed in the principles of Christianity, and pro-
tec el from periOBal 'njiirv. This is the consistent
and kird treatment of Sou hern slave. Tne book

This law the author sajs was repealed afier be-
ing suffered to remain on the statute boek for
many^ears; but he complains loudly of an Ohio
law, (in the enactment of which perhaps the gen-
tleman participated,) "intended to present colored
citizens of other States fiom removing into
Ohio," unless they "find within twenty days two
freehold sureties in the sum of five hundred dollars
for their good behavior, and likewise for their mtm-
tsnince," and m default thereof he is to be re-
moved by the overseer^ of the poor, and if any per-
son "harbors" emigrants who have not complied
with the above requisitions, he or she is subjected to
a heavy pecuniary penalty, and made hdble for
the future maintenance of the "negroes or mu-
lattoes "

Sir (said Mr Biack) let us see what the=e "hu-
man righU" gentleman think of th" right of petition
in their own country, and then we shall be better able
to estimate thpir sincerity, and the jra ity of their
motives, when they undertake to lecture us for "keep-
ing humau beings in bondage " This right of peti-
tioning foi the liberation ofthe 'lave was the iheme
of many glorious declamations on this floor la't win-
ter, and thousands of dollars of the public money
were spent in giving these gentlemen an opportu-
nity to harangue us on the subjec', and to slip in
