THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

It will be perceived that the sum* of $-40,350 de-
ducted is said to be " notes which were funded"
under prior acts, as is supposed, of course. This
srum, therefore, is for the same thing as the sum of
$36,250; and the childish act is performed of ma-
, king the entry in the account, and immediately
afterwards deducting it from the same side of the
same account; and to make the transaction the
more remarkable, it is stated to be #4,3.00 less in
the one case than the other.
I think that the true amount of stock used to
fund notes of prior acts should be entered as a part
of the avails* of the loan, and should not be de-
ducted. It was merely so much stock used to
nan old debt, and it is the same as if the stock
been sold, and the money so applied.
These mistakes show a serious error in the first
item in the report of the Register of the Treasury,
and that the sum of $§5,679,199 45 is incorrect.
2. The second entry in the Register's statement
is as follows: " Deduct treasury notes redeemed,
under acts of 1846 and 1847, being part of the sum
of $9,361,397 07, included under the head of reim-
bursement of treasury notes for same year, the
difference being for notes redeemed under other
acts, $2,167,700."
In table A, accompanying the Secretary's report,
under the head of expenditures, is the following
entry: " Redemption of treasury notes, deducting
$3,193,200, which were funded under the act of
January 28, 1847, $2,361,397 07."
It was doubtless proper to deduct the notes so
funded, but the amount which is deducted as hav-
ing been funded during the year is not correct, if
the statement furnished from the books at the treas-
ury to the Committee on Public Expenditures is
correct. By that statement, it appears that the
amount of notes funded during the same year, of
the issues of 1846 and 1847, is, for the former loan,
$1,683,300, and that of 1847, $1,132,550, and show-
ing the same discrepancies as before referred to in
lelation to the first item.
•3. The next sum in the Register's statement is
the amount remaining after deducting an erroneous
amount, and the result is erroneous.
4. "Amount received for treasury notes and
loans during the quarter ending 30th September,
1847, omitted in the financial statement in the Sec-
retary's report, but contained in the table referred
to in that statement, $6,915,078."
This large amount is the one originally omitted
in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, and
which he at last discovered, very luckily, before'
the loan hill was finally acted upon. All the ma-
terials are not in my possession to enable me to
judge whether the item is correct or not.
5. The next amount of $30,426,577 45, being
the sum of the last two amounts, is of course er-
roneous.
6. " Deduct treasury notes reimbursed under
acts of 1846 and 1847, being part of the sum of
$2,385,329 63, included under the head of treas-
ury notes and interest, in the same quarter, the
difference being for treasury notes issued under
other acts and interest, $2,242,350."
7. Deduct also treasury notes redeemed, and
funded, issued under acts prior to act of 22d July,
1846, also part of said sum of $2,385,329 63,
$67,622."
I have placed these two sums in connection, as
they are, in fact, connected. There appears to be
a series of mistakes connected with these two
amounts. I pointed out in my former speech the
manifest mistake in relation to this sum of $67,622.
. The error is still persisted in. It is not so import-
ant in amount, being only a mistake of about
$135,000; but, as it seems to be claimed that it is
no mistake whatever, and is still paraded in the
treasury statements, and its correctness vouched
for in such high quarters, and an error here affects
the accuracy of subsequent statements in the re-
port of the Register of the Treasury, I propose to
consider it at length.
It appears that the outstanding treasury notes
issued prior to 1846, was, on the 1st of December,
1846, $388,030 97. By table F, in the Secretary's
report, it appears that the amount outstanding of
these notes, December 1, 1847, was $239,789 31,
Of course the amount redeemed during the year
was $148,241 66, and not $143,441 66,-as stated ;
in table E of the Secretary's report. It also ap-
pears, from the same table F, that a portion of these
notes were funded, amounting to $77,178. This
is supposed to represent the same notes as are de-
scribed in the above statement of the Register of
the Treasury as "notes redeemed and funded,
issued under acts prior to act of 22d July, 1846,"
$67,622.
The chairman of the Committee on Finance in
the Senate acknowledges the error of $1,401,900.
I endeavored to show that the amount was in those
statements $1,537,144. If the above statement is
correct, it would be about $20,000 more. This
error of erroneously deducting the *$67,G22, or
$77,178, is persisted in. It is an error. The ob-
ject is to show the amount of treasury notes and
loan available. This is- found by showing the
amount which has been heretofore used in ex-
change for specie, and in payment of debts, deduct-
ing the amount " redeemed." In this statement
of the amount" redeemed" is entered this sum of
$67,622, and thus much diminishes the amount of
" avails," and increases the amount available in
future. This is wrong. A portion of the stock
authorized under the loans of 1846 and 1847, is
used to pay an old debt. The amount of stock
thus used, is properly placed as a part of the avails
of these notes and loan. The stock is outstanding,'
a"nd constitutes a part of the public debt. It was
applied to pay treasury notes issued* under former
acts. This is the same as if applied to pay any
other debt, and that is the same as if it had been •
exchanged for specie, and that specie applied to
pay that debt, or for any other purpose. The
stock is outstanding, a debt against tne Govern-
ment. So much of the loans of 1846 and 1847
have been used. It cannot be used agairrt It di-
minishes the amount on hand. If if is said that
this is merely a payment of an old debt by a new
one, it is true; but nothing to the purpose. Much
of this loan has been very properly so applied.
The amount of stock or notes on hand is as effect-
ually exhausted by taking up an old loan, or pay-
ing any old debt, as by exchanging the amount for
specie. Surely nothing can be more evident, and
yet the Department of theTreasury,and the friends
of the Secretary and Administration in both Houses
of Congress, persist in this gross error. The ques-
tion is, whether the amount of the avails of treas-
ury notes and loans of 1846 and 1847 for the
quarter is reduced, because a part of the notes or
loan is applied to pay this old debt. These notes
are not reissuable, but are cancelled when paid,
like any other debt, and just so much of the loans
of 1846 and 1847, as is used to pay them, does,
most clearly so much reduce the balance remain-
ing available of the notes and loans of 1846 and
1847.
It will be seen, by a reference to the statement of
the Register, that the amount of $67,622 is twice ;
deducted from the avails of the notes for the quar-
ter. First it is deducted as a part of the sum of j
$2,385,329 63, or, which gives the same result, of
$2,242,350, from the sum of $30,426,577 45; and,
having thus much reduced the avails of the treas-
ury notes, it is again deducted from those avails
thus reduced. Instead of being deducted from the
avails of treasury notes, it should have been de-
ducted from the sum of $2,385,329 63, and so
much reduced the amount to .be subtracted from
the avails of treasury notes. If it is claimed that
the act of January 28, 1847, authorized the issue
of stock beyond the $33,000,000, to provide treas-
ury notes issued under prior acts—which I do not
admit—it does not relieve the difficulty. I cannot
but think that this sum is entirely wrong, and that
no such sem exists on the books of the treasury.
It purports to be a part of the sum of $2,385,329
63. By the statement furnished to the Committee
on Public Expenditures, the items of this sum ap-
pear, and the only entry of treasury notes funded
under prior acts for the quarter ending October 1,
1847, is the sum of $22,478.
8 and 9. The two sums of $28,184,227 45 and
18,116,605 45, on account of these errors and
those previously pointed out, are of course far
from the true amounts.
10. "Deduct also the amount of treasury notes j
issued under acts of 1846 and 1847 which were in 1
the hands of the accounting officers on the 1st
October, 1847, and not covered by warrants, but
which notes, when covered, will make the charge
against the treasury equal to the notes converted
into stock or received for public dues, $1,401,900."
If I am right in the positions which have been
taken in relation to the previous entries in this
statement, the inevitable conclusion is, that this
last amount is purely fictitious, given entirely at
random, and to force a balance. Tf this be so, it
destroys all confidence in the statements of the
Treasury Department, and shows not only confu-
sion but recklessness. It is a very serious matterr
indeed, if, when purporting to furnish officially a
statement of facts as actually appearing on the
books of the treasury, an officer at the department
furnishes at random, and without knowledge or
examination, the figures necessary to balance the
account. I am by no means sure that I understand
the explanation of the Secretary of the Treasury,
or Register, if he is the responsible person; but if
I do, the explanation sought to be given in no way
relieves the difficulty; and if there were any such
sum, the error would not be obviated at all.
11, 12, 13. The then remaining sums of $26,-
714,705 45, $6,285,994 55, and $33,000,000, being
the results of the previous erroneous calculations,
are of course themselves grossly wrong. The
sum of $6,285,294 55 was not the true amount of
treasury notes available for the remainder of the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1848, and the full
amount of $33,000,000 is not the true result of the
previous figures in this statement of the Register
of the Tieasury.
I have thus shown that the whole of this state-
ment of the Register is wrong, and that there is no
soundness whatever in it; that scarcely one indi-
vidual entry out of the thirteen is right; but they
are very far from the truth, provided the recent
statements furnished at the Treasury Department
are correct.
In the course of this investigation, I have thus
sustained the positions assumed by mc in my for-
mer speech, except so far as I ha?c shown that
the tables themselves connected with the report
of the Secretary of the Treasury are wrong. Oa
the basis of that report no position then assumed has
been successfully assailed, but all are, as I suppose,
fully vindicated.
I have not time or patience to give a full detail
of numerous other errors pointed out by my hon-
orable friend from Pennsylvania, derived from the
books and officers at the department. I will con-
tent myself, and relieve the House from these dry
details, with giving the results as they are exhib-
ited by his very full and precise statements on
some of the points.
The discrepancies shown by bringing down the
statement to the first December, 1847, in relation
to these treasury notes issued under the two acts
of 1846 and 1847 are as follows:
As to the amount of stock issued under the act
of July, 1846, the report of the Secretary and the
statement of the committee differ $115,200.
As to the stock issued under the act of January
28, 1847, $1,050,452.
As to the notes outstanding under the act of
1846, the difference is $178,150; and, under the act
of 1847, $1,437,400.
As to the amount of notes and loan available at the
Treasury, December 1,1847, under the act of 1846,
$293,350, and under the act of 1847, $386,950.
There is only one of the propositions taken by
me in my former speech which now remains to be
briefly noticed:
" 7. That the statement of the amount of public debt and
interest paid duunj* the year ending December 1, 1847, is
more than $10,400,000, as shown bv table E, and less, as
fchown by table Q,, than $9,300,000 foi seventeen months,
embracing the period mentioned in table E."
This discrepancy is admitted, but no attempt is
made to explain it. It is a practical and interest-
ing question how much of our public debt has been
paid during the year. It would seem to bean
easy question to answer. The head of the Treas-
ury Department has undertaken to answer it. In
one place he says that in twelve months it was
$10,480,362 14, and in another place that it was
but $9,045,511 35 for seventeen months, including
the same twelve months. In other words, that the
amount paid in the whole seventeen months was
$1,219,103 06 less than in three-quarters of that
time.
I ask, sir, does the Secretary know himself how
much of the public debt was paid during the times
mentioned ? If so, is it to insult or deceive Con-
gress that such a statement is sent to us? For my
own part, I do not suppose that the Secretary had
any idea whatever on the subject, otherwise how
could so monstrous a mistake have been commit-
ted? Is it true that the books in the department
are in so vicious a system or so badly kept that on
a point like this they contradict each other, and
