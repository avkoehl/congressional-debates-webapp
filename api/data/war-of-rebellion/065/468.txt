The steamer which attempted to run in on the night of the 1st was the Presto, from Nassau, New Providence, loaded with blankets, shoes, and salt beef. She got aground on the old wreck between Beauregard and Moultrie, between 11 and 12 o'clock. The engineer told my informant that htere are five or six steamers to run this blockade, of which this is the first. They come here because they consider ir easier to enter Charleston than Wilmington.

Torpedoes are sunk in the channel to blow up our vessels should they attempt to go in. there are two old boilers, one of which contains 3,000 pounds of powder, sunk in the harbor, and are arranged to be exploded from on shore by means of a wire.

I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
