THE-CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 24,
structiou of the national monument at Gettys-
burg shall be exempt from all duties and im-
posts.
Mr. MORMLL. I understand the corn-
tee have made arrangement already for the
monument to be purchased and manufactured
abroad.
Mr. HARDING, of Illinois. While I am in
favor of the monument, I dissent from the pol-
icy of going abroad for the materials if they
could have been got in America.
Mr. MORRILL. I would have been op-
posed to it if I had been 011 the committee of
arrangement.
Mr. FERRY. The monument is to be made
in America; the statues are to be made abroad.
It is impossible to procure the statues in this
country, or it is so deemed by the executive
committee, and they have requested that the
monument thus to be made be exempted from
tariff and excise. Proposals have been made,
all by American artists, the material to come
from abroad. That seems to be a necessity in
regard to the material for the four statues sur-
rounding the monument. I trust the House
will not object to the passage of this bill. The
amount to be exempted will be about three
thousand dollars, and certainly there can be no
objection to relieving the Monument Associa-
tion and the States at large that are interested in
this object of this small pittance.
Mr. 'MORRILL. I will state that the amount
of subscriptions is already sufiieient to carry
out the object if this bill should pass. If it
should not it will be necessary to call upon the
Stales for further contribution, which is thought
to be rather inconvenient at the present time.
1 call the previous question.
The previous question was seconded, and the
main question ordered; and under the operation
thereof the substitute was agreed to.
The bill as amended was then ordered to be en-
grossed for a third readingj and being engrossed
it was accordingly read the third time, and
passed.
Mr. MOURILL. I move that the title bo
amended by striking out the last word ''ex-
cises" and inserting in lieu thereof the words
u imposts and charges."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. MORRILL. I move to reconsider the
vote by which the bill was passed; and to lay
that motion on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
llkl-i anft acctimont insurance company.
Mr. IIALK, by unanimous consent, intro-
duced a bill to incorporate the National Life

Saturday, February 24, 186C.
The House met at twelve o'clock m. Prayer
by the Chaplain, Rev. C. B. Boyntojt.
The Journal of yesterday was read and
approved.
president's message.
The SPEAKER. By the order of the House
on yesterday, business to-day is to be confined
to debate, as in Committee of the Whole on the
state oftlieUnion, upon the President's annual
message. Upon that subject the gentleman
from Ohio [Mr. Plants] is entitled to the
floor.
Mr. PLANTS. I will yield to my colleague
[Mr. Clarke] for the present, with the hope
that I may obtain the floor after he shall have
concluded his remarks.
reconstruction.
Mr. CLARKE, of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, not-
withstanding the bitterness of feeling in which
the rebellion was projected, and the more than
savage ferocity with which it was prosecuted,
still the hearts of the loyal people of the nation
are full of tenderness, and ready to respond
with kindness to the appeals of our erring
brethren whenever those appeals are made in
the spirit that ought to touch our sympathies
and challenge our forgiveness.
If wo appear to move cautiously in the work
of reconstruction, and to consider the measures
necessary to that end with more than ordinary
deliberation; if we appear tardy in the eyes of
those lately in rebellion in our advances to- '
ward their restoration to their former condi-
tion in the Union, it should be a full answer to
them, and an ample justification to us, in the
judgment of all impartial minds, that we have
not only good cause to be deliberate, but that
haste in such an undertaking, with such great
responsibilities depending upon what we do in
that behalf, would not only bring roproach.upon
us as a deliberative body, but expose the coun-
try to results more calamitous, if possible, than
those from which we have but just emerged
after a four years' war.
The limes in which we live, and the people
with whom we have to deal in this work, are
worthy of careful consideration, for without a
just appreciation of them we have no assur-
ance that our labors will be either wise or well-
timed. Old things are passing away, and new
ones are taking their places; old ideas, old
errors, are fading out in the sunlight of truth,
and old customs and practices, based on ex-
ploded dogmas, are everywhere crumbling into
ruins, and a higher and holier order of things
succeeds, keeping pace with the moralizing and
Christianizing innuenceswhich mark with espe-
cial significance the ruling spirit of the times.
Slavery, that but a short time since was re-
ceived as a God-given institution to man, has
fallen under the ban of a purer morality and
gone down with the curses of the Christian
world resting upon its memory. Four brief
years have done the work for that monstrous
institution of outrage and wrong and crime
against humanity.
With the fall of slavery must also fall the
things pertaining thereto; the thing that was
yesterday a chattel is to-day a man, and the
master who yesterday had his heel upon the
neck of his slave to-day meets that slave upon
the level of a common equality in all that per-
tains to the natural and civil rights of man.
These changes are suddenly thrust upon us,
and upon those with whom we are dealing in
