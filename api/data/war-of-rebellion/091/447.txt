(Received 12.05 p. m.)

Brigadier-General DYER,

Chief of Ordnance:

I am instructed by General Sheridan to arm and equip and send promptly to the front all recruits, convalescents, &amp;c., for his command. I have here at this time 2,000 to go forward, but am delayed for want of infantry equipments. The ordnance officer tells me proper requisitions have gone forward, but they do not arrive. Will you please have them hurried up, as it is of importance to push the men forward.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

General Custer has just left here on his way to Washington, by special train, with ten battle-flags.
