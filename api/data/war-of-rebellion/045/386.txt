BRIDGEPORT, June 28, 1863.

Colonel COPPEE:

Two farmers, who left Goldsborough this morning, report that the rebels burned the bridges across the Conowingo and Gut Creek. General Smith will send them to General Couch.

CAMPBELL TUCKER,

Aide-de-Camp.

BRIDGEPORT, June 28, 1863.

General COUCH:

It is reported to me that the rebels are moving to their right, which would bring their attack here near the bridges. Some men ought to be stationed at the railroad bridge where it is cut. I hardly think there will be much fighting to-day. Can you send me a glass? I have not one. I have no men to spare for the island.

WM. F. SMITH,

Brigadier-General.

BRIDGEPORT, June 28, 1863.

Major-General COUCH:

I have nearly made all the dispositions I can make here. I am weak above and below the bridges, and could find use for two more regiments, if you have them. Send down arms at once for the Thirty-seventh New York; also some fifty-seven ammunition.

WM. F. SMITH,

Brigadier-General.

HARRISBURG, PA., June 28, 1863-2. 40 p. m.

Brigadier-General SMITH, Bridgeport:

I think that I can send you one regiment to-night.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

JUNE 28, 1863.

General WILLIAM F. SMITH, Bridgeport:

I have one four-gun battery. Can't send any more to-night.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

HARRISBURG, PA., June 28, 1863.

General SMITH:

We have a full battery of 12-pounders, six guns. Do you want all?

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.
