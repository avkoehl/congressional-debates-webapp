NEAR SMITHFIELD, N. C., April 7, 1865-8 a. m.

Honorable J. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Secretary of War, Danville:

Following received, dated Macon, 6th:

I telegraphed General Lee that in view of movement of enemy in Alabama Wofford's command should be kept in Georgia and ordered to report to me. The dispatch may not reach General Lee, and I ask your instructions. General Lee had ordered Wofford to cut communication between Knoxville and Chatanooga.

HOWELL COBB.

I refer this to you because I cannot change General Lee's orders.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

GREENSBOROUGH, N. C., April 7, 1865-10. 45 p. m.

General J. E. JOHNSTON, Smithfield, N. C.:

General Cobb reports fall to Selma. He considers Macon and Southwest Georgia in great danger, requiring more thorough protection.
