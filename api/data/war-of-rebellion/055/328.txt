The major-General commanding directs that you march with your whole force at daylight to-morrow in the direction of Trenton, keeping a sharp lookout on all the approaches from the south and east, reporting without delay any force you may find to Brigadier-General Geary, who will be found at these headquarters. You should move with two days' rations and forage, unless you are likely to gather forage in the valley. Take advantage of your movement to gather all the forage you need. The general suggests that you send your wagons to Kelley's Ferry to-day for what supplies you need,as there are no wagons on the road from Chattanooga there, and to-morrow there will be a great many.
