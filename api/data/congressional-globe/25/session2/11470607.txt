has heretofore been thought the bounden duty of this Govern
ment to take proper care of that great branch of the ndtionai
interest, anil wlwrea , that opinion is erroneous obsolete, ami
heretical, andwheieas, according to the true reading of the
Consti ution the great duty of this Government, and us exclu
siveduty,sofaraocjriencyisconcerucd, is to uke care of it
self, and whereas, if Government can but secure a sound cur-
rency for itself, the people may verv well beleltto such a cur
rencyasthe Sta'es,or the banks, or their own good fortune,
or bad fortune, may give them, therefore, be it enacted, &c
The very first provision of the bill la in keeping with its ge-
neral objects and general character It abandons all the sewu-
menta ol civilized mankind on the subject of ciedit and conn
dence, and carries us back to the dark ages The first that we
hear is of safes, and vaults <md c ella, and cloisteis JPiom an
intellectual it goes hack to a physical age Fiom comrcuaee
and credit, it returns to hoarding and hiding , from confidence
and trust, it retreats to bolts and bars, to locks with double keys,
and to pains and penalties for touching hidden treasure 11 s a
law for the times oí the feudal "vstcm, ora law for the heads
and governors of the piratical fetates of Barhary It is a mea
suie ht fortunes whantheie is no security in law, no value m
commerce, no active industry among mankind Here, it is al
together out of time and out of place It has no sympathy
with the general sentiments of this age, still less has it any con
geniality with our Ameiican character, anyreliah ofour hither
to appiovedand successful policy, 01 any agreement or confor
mity with the general feeling oí the countiy
The gentleman, in ^atm¿ the provisions  of the first section,
proceeds to say, that it is strange that none of onrhw^ heietn
tore has evei attempted to give o the Treasury of [he United
Sutesa "lúea! habitation" Hence it is the object oí this hist
section ofth > bill to provUe and define such local habitation A
local habitation fot the lieafturyol a great and giowin? com
mercial country, in the nineteenth centuiy W hy, sir, what is
the IVaauiy? ihecvistiiiglaws call it a ' Dt-paitmeiit' They
sty, ther^ s tail be aDepaitment, with vaiious ofheers, and a
piop„r assignment of their duties and functions, and that this
shall he the Department of the Treasui y It is thus an organized
part of Government, an impOLtant and indispensable branch of
the general adminis ration, conducting the fiscal affairs of the
country, and controlling subordinate agents
But this bill does away with all legal and political ideas, and
brings this important Department down to a thing ofbncksand
moitar    It enacts that certain looms in the new building, with
their safei and vaults, shall constitute the 1 leasury of the Uni
ted States'   And this adoption of new and «trange notion , and
tKis abandonment of all old ideas, i^all for the purpose of ac
comphsbiug the great object ofsepar itmgthe affans of the Go
vernment Irom (he affairs of the countiy     The nature oí the
means shows the nature of the object, both aie novel, fringe,
untried, and unheard of    The si heme, -<ir, finds no precedent,
either in our own history, or the histoiy of any other respectable
nation    It is admitted to be new, original, experimental, and
yet its adoption is urged upon us as confidently as if it had come
down fiom our ancestors, and had been the cherished policy of
the country in all past times
I am against it altogether I look not to see vvhethei the
means be adapted to the end That end itself is what I oppose,
and Í oppose ail the means leading to it I oppose all attempts
to make a separate currency ior the Government, because* I m
sist upon it, and shall insist upon it, until I see and feel th* pillars
of the Constitution falling around me and upon my head, that it
is the duty of this Government to provide a good cuiieney for
the country and for the people, as well as foi Itself
I put it to gentlemen U) say, whether currency be not a part of
commerce, oi an indispensable agentof commerce and borne
thing, therefoie, which this Government is bound to íegulate,
and. to take care ol? Gentlemen will not meet the aigument
They shun the question We demand that the ju^f power of
the Constitution shah be administered We assert that Congress
has power to regulate commerce; and curitncy as a part oí
commerce, we insist that the public exigency, at th*1 piesent
moment, calls loudly tor the exercise oí this power—and what
<lo they dol They labor to convince us that the Government it
solfean get on very well without providing a cutrency for the
people, and they betake themselves, therefore, to the Sub Ttea
suiy system, its unassailable walls, its iron ehests, anl doubly
secuieddoois And having satisfied themselves that, in this
wvy, Government may be kept eoiuff, they ate satisfied A
sound cuirency for Government, a sale cuuency forievenue,
these are the only thing  promised, the only things proposed
3iut these are not the old promise The country, the countiy
it elf,aiiu the whole people, were promised a be ter currt-ncv,
fortheirown use, abetter general currency, a better currency
lor ait the purposes of trade and. b istness ltus was the pi o
mise, sohmnly given by the Government in 18&Í, and so oí ten
afteiwards renewed, through all successive year*, down to May
last We heard nothing, all that time, of a sepaia ion between
Government and people No, si, not a word Both were to
h ivi. an improved currency Sir, I did not believe a word of
all this, I thought it ail mere pretence or ^mpty boating I had
no faith in these promises, not a particle But the honorable
member from New \ oik was confident, confident, then, as he
is now, confident of the success of the firstscheme, whuh was
plausible, is he is confident of th «, which issttange alien, and
íepulsive m us whole aspect He v?ai then as sur* «f being
ab.e to furnish a currency for the country, os he n> n >w of fur
niching a currency far Government He told us, at that «me,
that he believed the system, adopted by thelate Administration,
was iul!y compptetent to us object He felt no alarm foi the
re&ul, he believed all the Piesident had done, from the lemoval
efthe deposites duwnw Lids, was constitutional ami tegal, and
he was deieimiiied to plat e himself by the ide of the President,
an I desired only to stand oi fall, m the estimation of tus cons.ii

As I have said, sir, I had no faith at all mall the promises of
the Administration, made before, and at that time, a d < on
stantly repeated I felino confidence, wha ever, in the whole
project, I deemed it rash, headstrong, and presumy tnous, to ihe
fast degree And, at the risk of the charge of some offence
against tooét taste, I will read a paragraph from some lemarks
of mine, in February, 1834, which sufficiently show what my
opinion and niy apprehensions then were
"I have already endeavored to warn the country against irre

And now, sir, we see the upshot of the experiment We see
around us bankrupted porations and broken promises, but tve
see no promises moie leaíiy &nú emphatically broken than all
those promises of the Administration which gave us assuiance
ofa better currency These promises, now bioken, notorious
ly and openly broken, if they cannot be performed, ought, at
least, to be acknowledged 1 he Government ought not, m com
mon fairness and common honesty, to deny its own responsibili
ty, seek to escape from the demands of the people, and to hide
itself, out of the way and beyond the reach of the process of pub
lie opinion, by retreating into this Snb Treasury system I et
it, at least, come toith, let it bear a port of honesty and candor,
let it confesa its promises, ifit cannot perforin them, and, abovt,
all, now even now, at this late hour, let it renounce schemes
and projects, the inventions of presumption, and the resorts of
d< speration, and let it address itself, in all good faith, to the ^reat
woikof restoung thecunency by appioved and constitutional
mean*.
But, sn, so fai is any such coulee from all probability of be
mg adopted, so little gioundof hope is there that this Sub
Treasury system will he ahindoned that thehonorab'e member
from New York has eonttn led and argued in his pl"ce, that the
public opinion is more favoiable to this measure now proposed
than to any other which has been suggested lie cl uma for it
the character ofa favouu wi h the peop'e He makes out this
bub Treasury Ian to be quite high m popular estimation Cer-
tainly, sir if the honorable member thinks so, he and I see with
different eye* hear with different vais, or gather the means of
opinion fiom different sources But what is tbe gentleman'sar
t-umenti It is tins The two Houses of Congress, he says, re
fleet the wishes and opinions of the people, and with the two
Houses of Congie^s this system, he supposes, is more accepta-
ble than any ither
Now, sir, with the utmost respect foi the two Houses of Con
gress, and all their members, I must he peimitted to expressa
doubt an l, indeed, a g lod deal moie than a doubt, whethei, on
this subject and at the present moment, the two Houses do ex
actly refl ct the opinions and wishes of ihe people 1 slwu'd
not ha\e ul verted to the <s ate of opinion heie, compared with
the state oí public o\ mion m the country, if tho gentleman had
not foim ed an aigmnert on the supposed disposition ofthe two
Houses, and on tU e fact that Hiey truly set forth the public
opinion But, since he has brought such an argument, it m pro
per to examine its foundation
In a geneial sense, undoubtedly, sir, the members of the two
Houses must he undeistood to repiesent the sentiments of their
consúmenle, the people of the United States Their acts bind
them, as their representatives, a id they must be considered, in
a legal sense, a^confoiming to the will of their constituents
But, owing to the mmner of our organization, and to thepeii
ods anl tunes of elet uon, it certainly may happen that, at a
particular moment, and on a particular subject, opinion out of
doois may be one way, while opinion here is another And
how is it now, if we may judge by the «eual indications? Does
the gentleman hope foi no vote, in this, body, for this bill, but
sueh as shall be m hi" opinion, in strict accordance with the
wishes as generally understood, and most lecently expressed
in the S ite from which that vote shall come*
I shall be exceedingly sorry, sir, foi instance, to see a vote
fiom Maine given fortius bill I hope I may not But if theie
should be such a vote can the gentleman say that he believes,
m his conscience, it will express the wishes of a mammy of
the people of that St ue? And >o of New Jeisey, and one, if
not more Siates in the West Ijm quite suie that gentlemen
who mav giv their votes wdl discharge their duty according to
their own enlightened judgments, anil they are in no way ac
countable to me foi the mannei m which they discharge it, hut
when thf honorable member fiom New Yoik contends tint this
body now acourate'y represents the public opinion on the Sub-
1 leafctny system we must louk at the facts And with all po-i
sibie respect foi the honotable member, 1 miK even take leave
to ask h m, whether m his judgment, he, himself, is truly re
fleeting the opinions and wi&hesof a maiouty of the people of
Nfw\ork, wl He he is proposing and supporting this bill?
Wheie does he find evuknet of the favor of the people of that
State towaida this measure-"* I> íes he find it in the city? In the
country7 Intheiec ntly elected Hoase of Assembly? In the
recently elected members of the Senate? Can he mmoi phre
— can he lay a venue foi the popularity of this measure in the
whole State ol New lotfc? Between Mont auk point and Catta
ruiffjis, and between thf mountains oi Pennsylvania ard the
noith end of I akr Cnamplam, can he any where put tiK finder
on the map ana say. heit isa spot wheie the Sub Treasury is
papular? He may fin 1 pi icp^ no doubt though tin y are some
what scarce, wheie bis friends have been able to maintain then
ascendancy, notwithstanding the unpopulanty ofthe mea*uie,
but can he finl cup [ lace me sp )t, of an> extent, in which this
measure ol relief is the choice, the fa von e, ofa majority ol the
people"!
ftlr President, the! onorable member has Ions been in public
life and has witneseel ofu a the cnanges and fluctuations of
political parties and p luicil oj nuons And 1 will a<¡k him what
he thinks of the hurrtcai e which swept over New \ nk 11 (he
firptweekof Ust November7 Did he evei know the liH? Ilf
he beforeever been called t n to wi hstand "uch a whirlvvind1
or hadhepieviou*ly any «uspi* ion that sucl anon bieak n ti e

fe ued such a thtu^ much le*- than 1 hop^d foi it, i.nd m> own
hopes, dlt'iougn I had hopes, and strorg hope^, I must eonfet-s,
fe I far short or the actual result And to me, Mi President,
it seems perfectly plain, that the cause of this a^tnnishina:
change in p ibnc opinion i-> to be found, mainly, m the message
of September, and the Sub Treasury bill of the last session
The message, with its anti social, nnti commeicial, anti ropulai
doctrines and dogmas—the me«sago which set at nought all our
own manners and usages, lejected ail the teachings of expe
ncvuce, threat^neu the State m«titutienf and, anxious only to
take good care of the Government, abandoned the people to
Senate.
their fate; the message—the message— £ was, that did the great
work m New York and elsewhere
The messaee was that cave of Eolus, out of which the career
wg wind'* issued
"UnaEurusque notusque jruunt creberquoproceüts
Africus"------
mingling seas and skies, dispersing the most powerful political
combinations, and scattering their iiagments on the rocks and
shores    I might quote the poet further, sir,
,(et vastos volvunt ad littora fiuctus "
The political dtep seemed agitated to the very bottom, and
Us heaving bosom moved onward and forwaid the ' vastos
ftuctus" m nautical phrase, the big rollers of public opinion
The honoiabie member may say, or may think* that all this
was but the result ola transient impulse, a feveush ebullition,
a sudden surprise, or a change superficial, and apparent only,
not deep an^ leal Sn, I cannot «ay, butl must confess that if
tl e movement in New York last fall was not real, it looked
more like reality than any fanciful exhibition which I ever
saw If the people weie not in earnest, they certainly had a
very sober and earnest way of being in jest
And now, sir, can the honorable member, can any man say,
that in regard to this measure, even the House of Representa
Uves is certain, at this moment, truly to reflect the public
judgment? Though nearer to the people than ouiselvee, and
more frequently chosen, yet it is known that the piesent mem
bers were elected, neatly all of them, 1 efore the appearance of
the message of September And will the honorable membei
allow me to ask, whethei, if a new election of membeis of Con-
gress were to take place in his own state, to morrow, and the
newly elected members should take then seats immediately,
he thould entertain the slightest expectation of the patsage of
this bill through the House?
Mr President, m 1834 the honorable member presented to the
Senate resolutions ofthe I>ej.islatuieoi New Voik, approving
the previous c«u se of the Administration in i elation to the
currency He then uiged strongly, but none too strongly, the
weight due to those resolutions, because, he argued, they ex-
pressed the undoubted sense of the people, a« well as that of
the Legislature He said there was not, at that time, a single
member in the popular brauch of the Legislature who was not
in favor of those resolutions, either irom the cines ol Hudson,
Albany, Troy, Schenectady, Utica, or an almost endless nam
ber of incorporated tiadmg towns and villages, or the great city
of New York itself, which he justly calls the commercial em
ponum of the countiy, all these cities and villages being sur
rounded, as he most justly ¡>aid, by an intelligent population,
and cities, villages, and country, altogether, comprising near
two millions of souls All this was vei> well It was true
1 he facta weie with the honorable member And although I
most exceedin¿Iy regretted and dcploied that it was so, I could
not deny it And he was entitled to enjoy, and did enjoy, the
whole benefit of this i expectable supf oit But, tir, how stands
the matter now? What say these two millions of «ouls to the
Sub Tieamry? In the fiist place, what sa>e the cny of New
York, thnt gieat commeicnl emponum, worthy the genüt
man's commendation m 1834, and worthy of his commenda
tion, and my commendation, and all commendation, at all
tune ? What sentiments, what opinions, what feelings, aie
proclaimed by the thousands of hei meichants traders, mam
facturers, and laborers? What is the united shout til all ihe
voices of all her clasps* What ie it but that ^ou will put
down this Pew-fangled Sub Treasury system, ahite alien to
then intei ests and then feelings, at once, and forever? What is
it, but thai in mercy to the mercantile interest, the trading in*
lerest, the shipping interest, the manufactuung interest, the la
boimg class, and all classes, >ou will give up useless and perni-
cious political schemes and projects, .md íeturn to the plain,
straight course of wise and wholesome legislation? The  enti'
merits of the city cannot be mtsundei stood A thousand pens
and ten thousand tongues, aid a spiuted press, make them all
known Ifwe have not already heard enough, we shall hear
more Embarrassed, vexed, piet^ed and distressed, as aie her
citizens at this moment, yet their resolution i*> not shaken, then
spu it is not broken, and, depend upon it, they will not fee their
commerce, their business, their pioeperity and then happmef^,
all sacrificed to preposteious schemes and political empirn i«m,
without another, and a yet more vigoious, struggle And Hud
Km and Albany, and Tioy and Scheuectadj, and Utica—pray,
why may not the citizens of these cmcR have as much wtieht
with the honorable member now, as they justly had in 1834?
And does he, can he, doubt of what they think of h s bill? \y,
sir, and Ktjches'er, and Bttavia, and Buffdo, and the entne
western district of the State, does the honorable member sup
pose that, in the whole o! it, he would be able, by careful search,
