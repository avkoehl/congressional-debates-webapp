OFFICERS" RECORD.

An officers" record has been compiled, comprising all officers of the Quartermaster's Department each officer occupying one page, showing at one view a condensed record of his appointment, movements, services, changes, recommendations, &amp;c. For this purpose the books of the office have been consulted for over three years back. In proportion as this division has become more thoroughly organized this record has been made more minute, and is kept up daily-almost hourly.

ANNUAL REPORTS.

The annual reports received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1865, appertaining to the fiscal year ending June 30, 1864, were 591. From July 1, 1865, to the present the number of annual reports received appertaining to the fiscal year ending June 30, 1865, is 340.

From the latter tables have prepared for the annual report of the Quartermaster-General, showing the amount of supplies on hand July 1, 1864, received, purchased, manufactured, $c., during the fiscal year; also the amount of public moneys received and expended during the fiscal year.

Extract have been made from the narratives officers giving all the valuable information contained the for information of the Quartermaster-General.

The tables and statements referred to do not comprise all the operations of the Quartermaster's Department, because of the fact that a large number of the officers have failed to render their reports as required by general orders; but these exceptions are officers whose duties were light, nd if their reports had been rendered they would not swell to any great extent the lists prepared.
