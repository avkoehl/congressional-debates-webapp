army of at least 30,000 men-infantry. Even that force would be small for the object. An army of 23,000 men for offensive operations against Grant seems to me too small, considering his large force. We need very much good general officers.

I find it necessary to organize an army, and to provide for it subsistence, ammunition, and means of transportation.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. E. Johnston.

General.

JACKSON, MISS., May 28, 1863

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON, Secretary of War:

I respectfully ask that Surg. D. W. Yandell, medical director Hardee's corps, be assigned as medical director of my command. He is now on duty with me. Be pleased to answer by telegraph.

J. E. Johnston,

General.

Surg. D. W. Yandell will be assigned as you desire.

Secretary of War.

JACKSON, MISS., June 2, 1863.

(Received June 4.)

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON, Secretary of War:

Your letter of the 25th and a telegram from the President show that you are misinformed as to the force at my disposal. The effective force, infantry and artillery, is: From Lieutenant-General Pemberton, 9,831; from General Bragg, 7,939 from General Beauregard, 6,283; total, 24,053, Brigadier-General [W. H.] Jackson's cavalry (not arrived), and irregular troops protecting northern and southern frontiers not included.

Grant is receiving continual accessions. Tell me if it is your intention to make up the number you gave the President as my force, or if I may expect more troops. With the present force we cannot succeed without great blunders by the enemy. Each portion of this dispatch in cipher is independent of the preceding.

J. E. Johnston.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Richmond, Va., June 3, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston, Jackson, MISS.:

I am concerned at your telegram to the President as to the number of your forces. I had reported them to him as rather more than 30,000, thus made up: 3,500 taken with you; 10,000 sent from Charleston; 2,500 cavalry, and 6,000 infantry from General Bragg; 4,000 at least, under [J.] Gregg, at Jackson on your arrival; 6,000 under Loring. In addition, I suggested you might have a brigade or so from Port Hudson. Where was the mistake on my part?
