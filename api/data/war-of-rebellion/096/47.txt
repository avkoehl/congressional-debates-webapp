CIRCULAR Numbers 1.] HEADQUARTERS EXPEDITIONARY FORCES, January 5, 1865.

The commanding officer on each transport will keep on hand three days' cooked rations, ready to be placed in the haversacks of the men at the time of disembarking. He will also place a guard over the water-casks, and cause the strictest economy to be observed in the use of this important article.

By order of Bvt. Major General A. H. Terry:

A. TERRY,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, January 5, 1865-10 a. m.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

Transports left City Point yesterday for Baltimore sufficient to carry 4,000 infantry. They should reach Baltimore to-day, and will, no doubt, be there in time for the troops. If you do not guard agaist straggling and desertion you will lose many men, as the facilities at Baltimore are great and the business vigorously conducted by bounty brokers.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WINCHESTER, VA., January 5, 1865-2 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Four thousand troops will be sent from Stephenson's Depot at 10 o'clock to-morrow. It will require that time to get transportation there. I will take the necessary precaution to prevent desertions, as far as possible. Two of my best scouts have just returned from Staunton. They represent a gloomy state of affairs, and that the common conversation is that Virginia will be given up. This information I send for what it is worth. It does not tally with the information received from deserters from Richmond yesterday.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
