pursued since th" present Administration cimourn power,
there was enough money on hand to carry on these works dur

ted at an earlier peí íod of the se&sion to the Committee of Ways
and Means on the same subject
The g ntleman from New York, [Mr FirLMOPEJin the-
cnuir-eof sum íemarksmade theoiherday, said that our foi
treses were m a defenceless condition, that they had been en
tirely neglected and !eft m a siate of dilapidation under ihe for

the gentleman«houl 1 h3ye mide this leferenee, iliat he should
have brought p irty p jhties to bear upon a question with % hich
they had nothing todo If the gentleman was dispo ed to in-
troduce party politics heie, lie should have found some other
and more fittincr occasion He Mr McK admitteditto bepro
per that, at, some period of the sessions of Coneress,
there should be a general range of debate on all the great inte
rests of the countiy bu it should on some certain definite oc
casion—a=, forinstance, when the President's Message was re-
U n ed to the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
But when thesf ma teis of busines came before them, all such

But wasthcchnge tute that the last Administration, and
the Administiation which imm diately preceded it, had suf-

Heasaeitel, w thout fen of contradiction, thatsuch was not
the fact Mr Melt proc edpfl, msuppoit ol his posi i in, to

mentdurmff t'te forty pi evious years of h* existence Con
etess, he contended, had voted mo t libeial apptopriations tor
these purposes during the last twelve yeais for ihese works
Thp disbursemt nt of the money thus appropriated was left in
the hands of engineer officei s> and if there had been any wanton
waste of the public mo iey , these < fficeit-, not the fcxecuave,
were responstb'c And Mr McK aigued at considerable
lensrth, that liberally as ap rwpn itionshad been voted fortheeo
purposes undei the lite Admmistiat on, yttthat it was well
known that the fnends of that Ad-nmiatration endeavored to
piocurc apiiropuauous slid more liberal, but that its eiTorts
were frustrated by the ictio i of the party with which the gen-
tleman from JSew i o k |Mi I ji tmore] then and now was act
