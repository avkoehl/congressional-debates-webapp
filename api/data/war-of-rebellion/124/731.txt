MY DEAR CONKING: I cannot leave here now. Herewith is a letter instead. You are one of the best public readers. I have but one suggestion - read it very slowly. And now God bless you, and all good Union men.

Yours, as ever,

A. LINCOLN.

EXECUTIVE MANSION,

Washington, August 26, 1863.

Honorable JAMES C. CONKING:

MY DEAR SIR: Your letter, inviting me to attend a mass meeting of Unconditional Union men, to be held at the capital of Illinois on the 3rd day of September, has been received. It would be very agreeable to me, to thus meet my old friends, at my own home; but I cannot, just now, be absent from here, so long as a visit there, would require.

The meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional devotion to the Union; and I am sure my old political friends will thank me for tendering, as I do, the Nation's gratitude to those other noble men, whom no partisan malice, or partisan hope, can make false to the Nation's life.
