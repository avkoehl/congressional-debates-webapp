My scout at Point of Rocks crossed into Loudoun and captured 2 men, 1 a guerrilla, named Clay Rhine. One of the party who hoisted a flag of truce at Edwards Ferry, induced two Federal soldiers to cross into Virginia, fired on them, wounded 1 and captured and robbed the other. The Halltown pickets were attacked last night by guerrillas. There was some firing, but the guerrillas were driven back. I send two scouting parties into Loudoun and one to Charlestown.
