desire to enter a motion to reconsider in the
case of a particular bill.
Mr. HOLMAN. If tbatpractice bepursued,
then it will be an end to the introduction of
bills by unanimous consent.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. It was my pur-
pose, in offering the bill, to call it up on a
motion to reconsider, as I stated to several
gentlemen.
Mr. RANDALL. There was a clear under-
standing that motions to reconsider should not
be made; unanimous consent would not have
been given otherwise.
Mr. BENJAMIN. Is this motion debat-
able?
The SPEAKER. It is not. The gentle-
man from Ohio [Mr. Garfield] objects to
putting the motion in gross, and claims that
it, is not in accoidance with the rules of the
Ilunse lo move to reconsider and lay on the
table motions in regard to several bills. It
is, of course, not in order exeept by general
consent. ,
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. If the gentle-
man will except the bill I reported lor the
reissue of national bank notes, 1 will not object
lo bis motion.
Mr. HOLMAN. I am willing to except that
particular bill.
Mr. MAYNARD. I do not object to the
motion, bat I want the gentlemen on the other
side to understand that they are asking a favor
of the House.
Sir. RANDALL. We are not asking a
favor; we claim what is our right.
- Mr. HOLMAN. I modify my motion, so
as to except the bill referred to by the gentle-
man from Ohio.
The motion, as modified, was agreed to.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I now enter a
motion to reconsider the vote by which the
bill (H. R. No. 3002) to authorize a reissue
of national bank notes was recommitted to the
Committee on Banking and Currency.

that Tuesday next, after the morning hour, be
set apart for the consideration of the report
of the Committee of Elections in the ease of
Mr. Rogers, claiming a seat from the State
of Tennessee.
Mr. DICKEY. I object.
Mr. CESSNA. Well, I will say Wednesday
after the morning hour.
Mr. PETERS. Is there not a special assign-
ment of the report of the Committee on Edu-
cation on the case of General Howard for
Tuesday next at half past one o'clock?
The SPEAKER. There is; and this order
could not interfere with that, because that
order is to the exclusion of all other orders.
Mr. DICKEY. To the exclusion of all other
orders?
The SPEAKER. The House, by a suspen-
sion of the rules a week from Monday last,
ordered that Wednesday, February 14, at half
past one o'clock, should be assigned for the
consideration of the report of the Committee
on Education and Labor in reference to the
Freedmen's Bureau.
Mr. DICKEY. I shall object to any spe-
cial orders that interfere with the appropri-
ation bills.
The SPEAKER. Of course all special
orders interfere with the appropriation bills.
Mr. DICKEY. Then I object to them.
Mr. CESSNA. I will modify my request,
and say Thursday morning.
Mr. DICKEY. I object to any day being
fixed.
Mr. CESSNA. Then I give notice that on
Monday I will move to suspend the rules so
as to have some time assigned for the consid-
eration of that case.
Mr. PETERS. I desire to ask unanimous
consent of the House that the Committee on
the Judiciary be allowed to report on Friday
nest, which is private bill day, to the exclu-
sion of other business, in the case of McGar-
rahan, commencing at half past one o'clock.
Mr. BINGHAM. That will include the
majority and minority reports, and the case is
to be considered then.
Mr. PEl'EltS. Certainly.
Mr. MAYNARD. That case will take up
a good deal of time. Does the gentleman pro-
pose to dispose of it that day ?
The SPEAKER. It' it is not finished on
that day it will not go over under such an
order as the gentleman proposes. It will go
on the Speaker's table.
Mr. PETERS. We can just as well finish
it in oue day as not. ,
Mr. MAYNARD. If "when the brains
were out the man would die " we could afford
to give a day to the disposal of that case.
Mr. PETERS. Let us vote it up or down
and have done with it.
Mr CESSNA. I have agreed with my col-
league [Mr. Dicket] that 1 will only ask for
twenty minutes for the consideration ot the
case of Mr. Rogers.
Mr. DICKEY. With that understanding I
withdraw my objection.
Mr. RANDALL. The gentleman has not
the power to agree to contine the debate to
one hour.
Mr. BURR. I am satisfied that discussion
would be unavailing in that case, and there-
fore I object to any arrangement to take up
the time of the House with ii. I do not object
to the report of the committee being acted
upon without discussion.
The SPEAKER. The Chair would suggest
to the gentleman from Maine [Mr. Peibbsj
that Friday next is the third I'nday in the
month, and is assigned for business of the
District of Columbia under a special rule of
the House.
Mr. PETERS. Then I ask unanimous,con-
sent to move that Saturday next, at half past
one o'clock, be assigned for the consideration
of the report of the Committee on the Judi-
ciary in the McGarrahan case.
There was no objection ; and the motion was
