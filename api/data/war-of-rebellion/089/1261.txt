delay than it would be prudent to make. I shall order the troops to be ready and shall either send a division to you or move out and try and get at the enemy early in the morning. If I can get at him on this side I think it will be a better move, but as there is some doubt about that it may be better to re-enforce you by a division. If you can wait until day after to-morrow for the re-enforcements I can move out to-morrow and ascertain what can be done here, in time to send the division on the following day. In case I find that I cannot operate here to advantage the troops can go to you by rail, at taft time; it might answer you as well. May you not use a brigade of General Pickett's in defending, whilst I am trying to operate here offensively? Please let me know your decision at the earliest possible moment.
