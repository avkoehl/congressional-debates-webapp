HDQRS. SEVENTH MIL. DIST. OF SOUTH CAROLINA,May 11, 1864.

Respectfully forwarded, for the information of the major-general commanding.

The shells of the enemy did no damage, but it is to be noticed that they fell within the new lines (southern lines) as far up, I have been informed, as Battery No. 3. It is well also to observe that two new encampments are reported on Folly Island.

No. 44. Report of Lieutenant Colonel O. M. Dantzler, Twenty-first South Carolina Infantry, of destruction of U. S. steamer Housatonic.
HEADQUARTERS BATTERY MARSHALL,Sullivan's Island, February 19, 1864.

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to report that the torpedo-boat stationed at this post went out on the night of the 17th instant (Wednesday) and has not yet returned. The signals agreed upon to be given in case the boat wished a light to be exposed at this post as a guide for its return were observed and answered. An earlier report would have been made of this matter, but the officer of the day for yesterday was under the impression that the boat had returned, and so informed me. As soon as I became apprised of the fact I sent a telegram to Captain Nance, assistant adjutant-general, notifying him of it.

Very respectfully,

O. M. DANTZLER,

Lieutenant-Colonel.

Lieutenant JOHN A. WILSON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
