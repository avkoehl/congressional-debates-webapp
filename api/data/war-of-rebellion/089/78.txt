CITY POINT, Va., October 4, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER,

Varina:

I will be up to see you in the morning. The difficulty of holding more than we now have, I think, should keep us from further offensive operations until we get more men. We will have eat least 30,000 additional veteran troops in the next ten days, besides all the new troops that may come.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
