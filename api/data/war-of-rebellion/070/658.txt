HDQRS. FIRST CAV. DIV., DEPT., OF WEST VIRGINIA,Catawba Mountain, Va., June 21, 1864.

Major General D. HUNTER,

Commanding Department of West Virginia:

SIR: I have the honor to state that the rod up the mountain is blockaded for about four miles. We have removed about half of it. A small squad of the enemy was found in the gap. The retreated by the road leading to Fincastle. I have ordered that the Fincastle road by heavily blockaded. The road we are on is said to have bee blockaded by militia and negroes. The white men belonged to a factory on the summit of the mountain. I shall destroy it. It will be important for me to know the next gap through which we pass, as soon as possible, so that I can send forward and occupy it. The road up the mountain is rough and will be very difficult for artillery and the train. I have noticed, in passing the train, many worthless wagons, which might be thrown out and the horses used to assist the artillery.

I am, general, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

A. N. DUFFIE,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

Philadelphia Inquirer and other papers say Mosby and 200 or 300 horsemen have crossed Potomac northward at Falling Waters or vicinity. Is there the slightest foundation for this statement?
