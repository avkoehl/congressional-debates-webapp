The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Pennsylvania has made a motion to post-
pone the further consideration of the bill until
to-morrow.
Mr. RAMSEY. The bill must be consid-
ered at some time, and it may as well be con-
sidered now.
Tbe motion was not agreed to.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Secretary
will read the bill.
The Chief Clerk proceeded to read the bill,
and having read several pages,
Mr. EDMUNDS. I suggest that the bill be
read as amended by the Post Office Commit-
tee. That will save a little time.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will
regard the amendments as agreed to without
any formal vote. The Secretary will now
report the bill without noticing the amend-
ments, and read the bill as if the amendments
were incorporated in the (ext.
The Chief Clerk having read several more
pages, i
Mr. EDMUNDS. On reflection I do not !
think it light to have my single will inter- i
posed against that of the rest of.the Senate ;
to compel the reading of this bill. If nobody I
else wants it read, I withdraw my call. j
The VICE PRESIDENT. The_ Chair has !
examined it. There is no legislation except
the names of the routes. The amendments
will be regarded as agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate as
amended, and the amendments were con-
curred in.
Mr. CORBETT. I am authorized by the
committee, 011 page 31, line seven hundred and
forty-eight, after the word "via," to move
to insert "Manzanita, Hanna's Ferry, Big
Meadows;" and in line seven hundred and
forty nine, to add "to Jacksonville:" and in
line seven hundred and fifty-one, after " Coos
City," to insert "Mansfield."
The amendment wa3 agreed to.
Mr. WRIGHT. After line two hundred and
thirty-four, under the head of " Iowa," I move
to insert "from Neolato Glenwood."
The amendment was agreed to.
The amendments were ordered to be en-
grossed, and the bill to be read a third time.
The bill was read the third time, and passed.
redemption of lands.
Mr. SHERMAN. The Senate passed a bill
the other day which was considered of import-
ance in regard to the redemption of lands sold
for taxes held by the United States. The Sen-
ator from Kansas [Mr. Pojieroy] moved a
reconsideration. That has been pending for
some time. He desires to offer an amend-
ment to one section of the bill to which I have
no objection. I should like to have that
adopted and let the bill go to the House. It
will take but a moment.
By unanimous consent the Senate proceeded
to consider the motion to reconsider the vote
on the passage of the bill (S. No. 780) to pro-
vide for the redemption and sale of lands held j
by the United States under the several acts ;
levying direct taxes.
The motion to reconsider was agreed to;
and the vote ordering the bill to be engrossed
for a third leading was leconsidered.
. Mr. POMEROY. I move to amend the
eighth section by inserting, after the word
no,'* the words "farm, plantation, estate,
Of; ' and after the word "cemetery," in line >
two, by inserting " or which lias been set ,
apart for that purpose;" so as to make the
section read: j
That no farm, plantation, estate, or lots or tracts !
2,l. u u0n ^hich there is a national cemetery, or i
wbieb. has been set apart by the President of the :
united btates tor that purpose and now needed tor โข
Military or naval purposes, shall be included within
tne provisions of this act.
Mr. SHERMAN
that amendment.
The amendment was
I have no objection to
to.
. The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a
third reading, read the third time, and passed.
jbdojss in mississippi.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The morning
hour has expired, and the Post Office appro-
priation bill is before the Senate.
Mr. AMES. I should like to have Senate
bill No. 918, to provide for the appointment
of a district judge iu each of the judicial dis-
tricts of Mississippi, taken up and considered.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It requires unan-
imous consent.
Mr. W1NDOM. I shall not object to this
one bill if it does not give rise to discussion.
Mr. TRUMBULL. That is a bill to make
another judge.
TheVICE PRESIDENT. It requires unan-
imous consent to consider the bill at this
stage.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I wish to say one word
in regard to this bill ; I will take but a mo-
ment. There are quite a number of bills cre-
ating additional districts in the United States.
1 am opposed to them all.
Mr. EDMUNDS. This doesnotcreate one.
Mr. TRUMBULL. It does create another
judge in Mississippi. I believe there is no oc-
casion for two judges there, and 1 believe there
is no occasion for the multiplication of judicial
districts in the United States. I am opposed
to them all, and I will certainly object to those
bills being called up by unanimous consent and
passed in this way.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Minnesota who reported the Post Office
appropriation bill gave notice of his objection
to debate. The Senator from Pennsylvania
asks unanimous consent during the morning
hour to take up'a bill, and the Senator from
Minnesota gives notice that he will object to
further requests.
Mr. W1ND0M. 1 give notice now that I
will object to any other after the bill proposed
by the Senator from Pennsylvania.
SJiltVlOESTO GERMAN!'OF AMERICAN Ol'b'ICERS.
Mr. CAMERON. I move to take up Senate
joint resolution No. 6.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Secretary
will report the title of the biil reported by the
Senator from Pennsylvania from the Commit-
tee on Foreign Relations. It is subject to ob-
jection.
Mr. CAMERON. T *rust there will be no
objection, as it is a mere matter of form.
The Chief Clerk read the joint resolution
(S. R. No. 6) permitting certain diplomatic
and consular officers of the United States iu
France to accept testimonials from the em-
peror of Germany lor their friendly services
to the subjects of the empeior during the war
between France and Germany.
Mr. SUMNER. Has that the sanction of
the committee?
Mr. CAMERON. Yes, sir.
Mr. SUMNER. 1 must object to it with
my whole soul.
Mr. SPRAGUE. I object.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Massachusetts and the Senator from
Rnode Island both object-
Mr. SUMNER. I consider it a most vicious
proposition, utterly untenable.
Mr. CASSERLY. I cannot sustain such a
proposition under any circumstances.
Mr. CAMERON. I trust Senators will
allow me to say a word before they put in
their objections.
Mr. SPRAGUE. I object to any debate
on it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Rhode Island objects to any debate.
Mr. CAMERON. I do not wish to debate
it, but only to say a word in explanation.
Mr. SPRAGUE. I cannot consent.
Mr. CAMERON. I can make my remarks
on the post office bill, then, if I like. [Laugh-
ter.]
The VICE PRESIDENT. The post office
appropriation bill is now before the Senate aa
in Committee of the Whole, and the Senator
from Pennsylvania has risen to debate it.
Mr. CAMERON. What is the question?
[Laughter.]
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Secretary
will report the pending amendment. When
the bill was previously considered it was pro-
gressed with as far as the amendment to the
fourth section. The Secretary will now report
the amendment to that section.
The Chief Clerk read the amendment pro-
posed to section four, which was in line six to
stiike out the words "San Francisco" and in-
sert " some port of the United States on the
Pacific coast;" and in line eight to strike out
"ยง500,000" and insert "$1,000,000."
Mr. WINDOM. I desire on the part of the
committee to perfect this amendment before
it is acted upon.
The VICE PRESIDENT. _ The Senator
from Pennsylvania was recognized.
Mr. WINDOM. I have no objection to the
Senator being heard.
Mr. CAMERON. I move that that part of
the bill be referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The effect of
that motion, if it should prevail, would be to
refer the whole bill.
Mr. CAMERON. Of course, I understand
that. It seems to me that all these questions
which have direct relation to our connection
with foreign countries ought to be examined
by that committee which has charge of all our
foreign relations. I make this motion because
it is time we should look into our condition
wiih regard to Europe as well as Asia and all
the other countries beyond the ocean. I do so
more particularly now because there is an
objection made by the Senator from Massa-
chusetts, and the Senator from California, and
the Senator (iom Rhode Island, and I am
sui prised at the Senator from Rhode Island
especially ; because he is generally so liberal
and so grand in all his notions 
Mr. SPR/VGUE. I am against ornament.
Mr. CAMERON. The emperor of Germany
has, through his minister here, asked the State
Depaitment to call upon Congress to allow
him to present some testimonials to our diplo-
matic and consular officers in France for ex-
traordinary services which they rendered to
sick and disabled members of the German
army. It seems that, Mr. Washburne, as well
as all those representing our country iu France,
were especially careful of the sick and wounded
German soldiers who happened to be in
France and under their care. For that reason
the resolution was reported this morning, and
I do not believe that any Senator here, if he
will reflect upon it for a moment, will object
to granting this request made by the emperor
of Geimany, a man who has rendered such
important services to his country as at the
present time to make him hold the highest
place iu his country that anybody ever has held,
and who has had around him, as they have
proved by their acts, the ablest men in the
world, both in the field and in the cabinet.
When such men come here and ask our Gov-
ernment that they shall be allowed to make
a small testimonial of their gratitude for the
extraordinary services performed by our min-
isters and consuls, why should we refuse so
small a request? Our ministers do not ask
this ; our consuls do not ask it j but the em-
peror of Germany himself makes a request
through the State Department that he shall be
allowed to manifest his kindly feeling toward
this country and the representatives of this
country.
Having said this, I have said all 1 should
have sa,id before, and now I withdraw my
motion to refer.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
withdraws the motion to refer. The question
recurs on the amendment reported by the
Committee on Appropriations.
