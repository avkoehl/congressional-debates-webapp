mortuary record exceeding the estimate of
deaths from the other rolls.
The confederate prisoners of war who died
were 30,152, as showu by the mortuary records
of the War Department, gathered from the
eighty-nine different places of interment at
hospitals, forts, and prisons where they were
buried, and are stated thus :
Officers    4§5
Enlisted men   ......29,216
Citizens    481
Total .30,152
Of these the names are kept and graves
designated of 29,426, aad names not kept of-
726. Of this latter number 662 were at Alton,
Illinois, leaving only '64 unknown at'the re-
maining eighty-eight places. Why this heg-
leet at Alton 1 do not know ; but it is Repre-
hensible, and is the only record in all our
responsibilities to becondemned. There were
only 1,549. deaths of confederate prisoners at
Alton prison, and 682 of these are marked
"unknown."
Turning now from a further consideration of
the Union losses in the late rebellion, I come
to speak of the confederate prisoners of wm
who died while in United States prisons, as
shown from the records of captures and mor-
tuary record. Rebel prisoners of war are bur-
ied, as shown by the Union records and other
testimony, in eighty-nine places, the principal
ones being as follows:

Of the 3g,401 deaths of Union prisoneis in
rebel hands, 15,816 of their graves, or nearly
one half, cannot be designated, while out of
the 30,152 deaths of confederate prisoners in
Federal hands, 726 graves, or one in forty-
three, cannot be designated by name, though
they are all pfoperty made,'while those of the
Union prisoners are not.
The losses of confederate prisoners held in
Federal prisons in proportion to the number
captured may be stated thus :
Number captured, (as shown by the report of
March 1,1869,) ;... 476,169
Addition on mortuary record ,  3,378
„  
Total 479,547
Of these there died while prisoners: offi-
cers, oqe in fifty-eight; enlisted, one in six-
teen ; citizens, one in seventeen.
Escaped: officers, one in two hundred and
seventy-three; enlisted, one iu two hundred
and sixty-five.
Joined our army: officers, one; enlisted,
one in eighty-eight.
Released at close of war: officers, one in
six of all captured ; enlisted one in six.
Proportion of rebel graves marked properly:
forty two in forty-three.
War arouses the baser passions of our nature,
and in all ages prisoners of war have suffered
at the hands of bad men. One of the first
duties of a Christian civilization is to prevent
war, where it can be done with due respect to
the honor of the people and protection to their
personal liberties and enjoyment of property,
and, when wars must needs be, to ameliorate
the condition of those engaged ia it. In the
early ages the fate of the prisoner of war was
death; but this among the more civilized
nations (either for gain or a growing humanity)
was changed to enslavement; which again,
during the years of chivalry, from the fifteenth
to the seventeenth century, advanced to the
custom of r&ris'om in money or property; but
a failure to pay remanded the captive to slavery
or death. Ransom has n6w given wpy to
fia'role or exchahge (taring war, and release at
its close. I hope that the high moral, polit-
ical, and military position of our people will
enable our Government to procure the adop-
tion in the laws of natiofts of a provision that
captives in warsball'not bfipersoftally retained
as prisoners, but shall, under flags of truce,
be returned at thefearliest possible time to their
own' lines or vessels, and paroled until properly
exchanged, so that the books of the commis-
sioners of exchange of the respective belliger-
ents shall determine the relative advantagesin
captives, and thttfc the horrors and sacrifices of
prison life prevented.
I had two purposes in examining the subject
of the tre&tmeiit of jfrisoners of war. One was
to give "the people a feteord of the suffering's
and sacrifices of prigSnew, and expose this
great petaOti&l wrongs heedlessly and reck-
lessly iitipoged on ttieto ; 'the othef was to lay
the foundation to establish in our international
laws a universal system of paroles, and a pro-
hibition of the personal retention in confine-
ment of prisoners of war ; so that the horrors
of Calcutta, the enormities of British India,
the severities of French Algeria, the cruelties
of British prison ships, tbe barbarities of
Paris,' the slaughter of Cuban prisoners, and
the combined atrocities practiced by the rebels
at AndeAonVille, Belle Isle, Libby, Salisbury,
Fforeftce1, Tyler, arid other' prisons of the Con-
federacy, may not be Wenacted, and civiliza-
tion put to shame by' its own professed sup-
porters ; that otfr humanity may not be lost
when most needed, or religion become a
mockery and by-word in its failure to impress
man with charity for his 'fellows. This is the
time and this iis the place for such a move-
ment. ' 1 ■
Having become de'eplyim'pressed with this
belief, I coitimenced the study a'n'd labor as best
I cWil<J fdrfeueh action sotfie years since, and
now hope that thfe'work will goon to its final
consummation. In persoiial liberty, religions
t(iterance, financial resources, and material
progress, we ai e to-day without a rival or a
parallel. :We have taught the world to respect
all neutral vessels on the high seas. Now let
them learn of us the grander lesson of kind and
humane treatment of prisoners of war, both
naval and land forces, who have committed no
crime, but whose offense is only- that loving
thai* oWii country they have been willing to
do battle for it. Let us teach the woWd to en-
courage virthe and patriotism' by the sacred
defense and protection their 'Country's sup-
porters, and all honest men willbleSs and sus-
tain our course,
Our example of free government has been
caught up by the peoples of all Europe. A
growing sense of their own worth and power
has made them bold ; so that to-day all her
monarchs sit uneasily on their thrones, and
yield, without resistance, to the demands of
their subjects.
Russia's Czar, in the peaceable liberation
of the serfs of his dominion, did, by a wise
sense of justice and true statesmanship, that
which, prior to March, 1861, our treason-
able officials and badly-managed Government
opposed and provoked a great rebellion to
prevent in this country.
Russia by this act has marched boldly to the
front ranks of civilization, and will take no
backward step in the great humanitarian work
of protecting by law the defenders of her
power and her glory. Japan has opened her
ports to advancing civilization, and sends her
embassies to all the world for instruction.
The commissioners from that Government are
with us now. I hope we may impress them
with a high sense of our Christian virtues as a
