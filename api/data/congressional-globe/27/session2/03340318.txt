RETRENCHMENT AND REFORM
The Sefate ttfen took up the resolutions of Mr Clay, to in-
crease thi tariff übove the max niumoi the Compromise act, to
repeal thel, pr^visK n of the Distribution act, which requires its
op=iation|o be suspended ifa duty of more than 20 percent be
demandel to4upport the Government, to letrench and econo-
mize the expenses of Government
íowhjpbÍMi Wright had pioprwed amendments—in favor
of practr#3íí economy by abolishing useless offices, by topping
offall unMcessaiy experses in Congiess and all die Depart
merits oribe Government, and Lv lepealing the Dibtnbution
act so as to reí der any mu ease of the tariff above the Com-
promise ict, or any new buidenson tne peoph, unnecessary
Mr MIÍLER addressed ihe Senate for about two houis,
chiefly in i elation to the res^lu ion in favor of raising a reve-
nue of twenty six milhon=ot do!!ai«, and adjusting the tariff so
as to afford i íotection to domestic manufactuies He observed
that ihe series of resolutions em biaced the whole economy of
Govemmen' in which was included the adjustment of com-
meicial relations wuh other nations upon such pimciples as to
encourage notdtpies the domestic mdu->tiy of the country
ííi felt eonfident that if tite pihcy laid down by his honorable
inend fiom Kentucky [Mi Í lay] weie fully adopted, it would
in use a new oi game pr ciple into this Union, the result of
which wou'd be its pre eminent prosperity and (.ermanency
After leiapitn'atmg the sj ecific objects of the i ¿solutions*
Mi M obsei ved m relation to the remarks made on their intro-
duction, as to several of them being only truisms which met
general assent, that ai) great and important íevolutions and
popular improvements m the science of Government, owed
their origin to the simple avowal of iridis( utable truisms
Then leiteiation induced lefiection, and even ually action m
accoidance with them, till finally they ¡ed to the establishment
oí great principles
He dwelt for some time on the abstiaet principle of the reso
lution, which laid it down as an axiom that the income and
expenditures of Government ought to be so abjusted as to
dvoidetnbairassment, lllustianng his argument  by the conduct
of a piudent inthvi lual who piovides means for the wants of
his family, by the proceeds of his industry without embarrase
mg hs futute life, by hoi rowing fiom others, or anticipating
his income
From this he proceeded to the chargeagimsUhclateAdmi
nt&UaUon,of neglecting this pnnciple and arcused it of having
spent more thai the n come of G ivernn ent, and depend-
ed upon the expedient of Tiea^uiy note* to supply the
deficiency He also accused it of having spent the savmesof
preceding and moie piosperou  Administrations, and then left
the countiy m debt He enteiedmro many detail", with a
view of showing that Mr Van liureri s administration had
spent fifty one mil ions ovei its income fiom customs, and
thuty one mi'lions ovei us income fiom customs and public
lanJs uni ed He averaged theeustomsduring the iour years
ate gh ee muiionsayeii andtneexpendnuicsattwenty seven
millions leavHig a deficit oí nine midion* In pioof of thi«,
he gave derails in figcies, and then asked, what wa-the result?
The icsiilt wa-' he an^weied that at the end of three years,
the Government was without means, n<n] an inadequate reve
ntie, aid was obliged to reson to the expedient of Treasury
notes He contended thit had the piesent A íministration, on
coming into powei, adopted the same course, and were it to
puisue that couise till the end of it-term oi foui years, it
would have to leave the Covernmentin deb fifty eight millions
He complained, m view of thi5* thattheoppo«ition as if to force
fhe Whigs into the same policy, had voted asainst all their
measures at the extia session—had resisted the Loan bill, the
