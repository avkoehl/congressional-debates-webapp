General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to forward herewith a rough statement* of the cavalry force in this department. As soon as I can get accurate statements of the regiments and detached companies I propose to organize the force into two brigades, and desire General Ransom's promotion as major-general, to command the cavalry. Colonel E. D. Hall is highly recommended by Major General D. H. Hill for brigadier-general of cavalry. I hope that he may be appointed to take the Second Brigade. If this force cannot be formed into a division of cavalry I desire authority to transfer General Ransom from his position in the infantry to the charge of the cavalry as a brigade. I have already explained to the Department the difficulties in the way of efficient operations of the cavalry, and desire that some action may be had which will increase its efficiency.

I remain, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

JAMES LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

Major General D. H. HILL,

Commanding at Goldsborough, N. C.:

GENERAL: I send up names of those who acted well in skirmishes on the 7th instant. The names of those who acted well last week I will send up as soon as the commanders can make them out. The charges against Forstler, the deserter, go up in the morning. Major Guion reported this morning, and I directed him to examine the country with a view of making a line from the work around the obstructions to Washington's Hill. I will report as soon as it can be made. I would like very much to have Coleman or some good engineer officer. The regi
