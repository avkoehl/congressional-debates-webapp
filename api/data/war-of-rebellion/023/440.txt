[CHAP. XXVIII.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, August 28, 1862.

Governor TOD, Columbus, Ohio:

SIR: Am without tents, knapsacks, &amp;c., for issue. Every exertion is being made to procure them. Rebel troops, many of them new levies, pouring into Kentucky, are without tents, clothes, or transportation. Our troops can do all theirs can do in this respect, yet they should have those necessaries if they can be had. The quartermaster here is doing his utmost. Have assigned General Judah to command of Camp Dennison. Would it not be well to put your troops there under his orders?

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, August 28, 1862.

General NELSON, Lexington, Ky.:

A brother of General Carter, from Cumberland Gap, says General Morgan had supplies of meat for fifteen days only on Tuesday a week ago. Other supplies ranging up to sixty days. His condition is worse than Buell's, and relief must be afforded at the earliest possible day. Mr. Carter estimates troops in Kentucky from East Tennessee at 15,000 and still coming.

Yours of to-day received. Will answer before night if possible. Sent a regiment to Carmeni's [?] yesterday.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.

LEXINGTON, KY., August 28, 1862.

Major-General WRIGHT:

I have not heard from General Halleck in reply to the telegram sent by me yesterday. The safety of the army in Tennessee and of our power in Tennessee demands that communication be opened immediately. It can be done in a week. Unless, then, you have powerful reasons to the contrary I will gather the regiments at Louisville, join them to those at Bowling Green, and force open the road. In the mean time let Mr. Guthrie be notified to provide an ample amount of labor to do the repairs. The regiments arriving here can go on to the camp indicated. I will leave a staff officer to direct them. The whole matter will not require more than a week of active exertion.

W. NELSON,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, August 28, 1862.

Major General WILLIAM NELSON:

Your dispatch regarding Morgan's supplies relieves me much. It is enemy's design to starve him into capitulation, but he can't do it if Morgan takes care of his provisions, as he seems to be doing, his men being on half rations. We can give first attention to IX.*
