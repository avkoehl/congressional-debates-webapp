Case of McLeod—Mr. Choate*
Senate-
requires a blow to be struck at once, and without waiting for
advice from the paramount power at home, 3t may call the
whole colonial population to arms by day 01 night, and obedi-
ence to such a call isas rightful as tna voidable, andas effec
tive for individual immunity as the obedience of a conscript or
an impressed seaman Such was this case. Was McLeod to
eay that the colonial authorities misjudged on the question of
necessity? They told htm the defence of the temtoiy and of
the Constitution of Upper Canada required this act Did he
know betterf Did he command a wide* horizon of view?
Could he be sure he had all the elements of a sounder opinion 1
Consider that to the colonial residents the colonial Government
is every thing. H is all of majesty, of monaichy, ofaristoctacy
that he ever sees in his life. To that all his duties appear to be
owing, and consider, too, that the spirit of thisgiand punciple
of individual responsibility is, that frana fide obedience to his
actual and lawful Government on a requisition of warlike ser
vice shall never be reckoned a crime m any man
You have before you, then, the case of a Government com
mandmg asubject, who was bound to obey, to shouldei his mus
ke* foi the defence of his country It is true the Senatoi from
Pennsylvania tells us that McLeod was a volunteer But he de-
duces no legal conclusio  from the fact; undoubtedly because
he remembers that, by the admitted doctrine oi international
¡aw, no distinction is recognised between volunteer and any
other soldiers He will remember that Vattel, at page 401, is
a direct authority for this. In the reason of the cise there can
be no distinction. The regularly enlisted soldiei engages vo-
luntarily, at first, for a longer term, ai d for all service, the vo
limteer engages for a shorter term, and for a special service
But both alike go forth to execute an authoritative public will,
and both stand, therefore, on the same plane of immunity and
hazard Consider, eir, what a great concern of ail nations it i«,
and of ours more than a 1 others, to hold a rule oí in'ernational
law on this subject thatshall make their inhabitants willingand
ready to leap to arms at half a moment's warning, at he imd-
u ght cry of their country
Yoü nave, then, I repeat, the case of a Government com
Handing a subject to go forth to an entei prise of war Why is
he not, then, within the terms and spiut of the great principle
of immunity which we all agree surrounds the s-ddier of a for
mal and public war? What aie the peculiarities that distin.
gmshthis particular service from the gcneraltiade of wai"7
Why, sir, they are said to be these that it was a single acr of
hostility, not preceded nor followed by any other, not preceded
by a declaration, ai-d wholly unjust This is ail true, but for
the objects of this inquiry it is whollv immateiidl Sir, publi-
cists and the practice of nations recognise vanotis modes, kind
and degrees of hostility War is not always general oi "per'
fectj" nor is it always preceded by a declaiation it sometimes
begins'and ends with one single cru&hiiis: blow Such wis the
attack on Copenhagen in 1801, and that m 1S0S It may bp h
mited to onesmgle act of reprisals, by a single individual, under
a license communicated to him alone A foieigu power his
seized his ship, and his own Government gtves> him letters of
mirque to help himself to another In point ofiact, too, war
otten begins without any declaration atall, at home or abir-ad
The bolt outruns the flash Modem histoiy is full of such m
stances, butlspareyou thereheiiaal of them Now,sir,what
I would say is, that, for the purposes oí immum'y to the sold <>r
andsailor, all these modes, kinds and degiees oi wai, come
exactly to the same thing They arp all and all alike modes of
governmental action, involving only governmental respom>ibi
lity. In many things they certainly cbffei one iiom another
Some of them are more chivalrous, moie magnanimous, moie
conformable with a stnct and punctilious pioceedmg, anda
technical law of war, than others borne of them ai/ord less
ground of complaint to the Government aosdik d than other-
But, for the purpose of peisonaln responsibility, they aie alione
and the same thing In reason it must beso Consider th it i
leading object of this principle of Immunity is the pioteciion of
the unfriended instruments of ambition or patiiotiüín who fur
rush the rank and file of war It is to protect the common soldier
And what an unavailing unceitam, en&nanng thing it would
piuvefoi him, lfhis title to it depended on such shidt-. of divei
sityaathese' How dues lie know whether the war, to wlu< h you
buHyhimaway fiom all that la dearest to him mthewoild is
jtt&tor unjust? How does he know by what heiail ol decidía
Hon it has been preceded? flow does he know whether the
desderate midnight enterprise for which you nave c died him
up from sleep is to be a single enterprise, or whether it is de
signed to kmdle the fitcs of a war that shah encircle the world'
Sir,he knoWfOnly thathisown Government, n obedience to
which he was bied—that the land of his birth—that the land of
his fathers' graves, bids him go forth, and that, if uc shnnK-j
ioi a moment from his post when the stoim oí battle ra^e-,
highest, he dies by the hands of hi  officer*,, and he goe-
forth relying on the armed but manly justice of civilized
war.
And so are all the authorities The Senator fmm Vn^mia
lecited th«m so copiously to you last evening, th tt I -shall -maio
youtheiepetition, and (ontent myself with a leferenceoi two
The ¡senatoi from Pennsylvania and the teecretaiy of te a e
tell you that the attack on the Caroline was unjust But Iml
into Vattel, on pages330, a\i 383, and Kutheiforth,21 volune
page 546, and you find that they com ur thtt the injustice cf
the war does not affeu the soldiei's title to immunity jf u uUl
the nations would at once return to the rmmierof pnsnneis u r
was there evei a warm which each belligerent did not think

Nor can you find, as I have said, a wold m any appioved
expounder of the actual law of nations, u appose to the textot
Rutheifoith Dicta, oí Giotiu , seen to f-onilict with it iiut
they only seem to contact with it Ever the e the Senatoi
from Pennsylvdnia has not availed himself of, because he
knows tl at Giotnis, admnable for his genius hi  studies, his
most enlarged and excellent spun, lived tooeai'y to witness the
full developmentoi his own grand punciple« and the accom
pli&hmcnt of his own pM.anthropic wishes The esioting law
of nations has been slowly built up since his time, and to leai n
it weinusthaveretouise to writer^, far hiainfeuors incapacity
and learning, but foi túnate m being able to record the amp
liorated theory and piaetice of a better day than his From
no one of these can you cite any thing m opposition to the
authonty I have relied on The Senator from Pennsylvania
thought he had discovered some such doctrine as he needs in
the 75th section of book 2d, chapter 6th, of Vaftel Hut the
Senator fiom Virginia was entirely accurate m his obseivauon
upon this pasbaoe, that it plainly refers to the rase of an mdi
vidual acting without authou y fiom his Government, and to
nothing else And then, in suppoi t of the position of Ruthei
forth, I may lemmd you that, as the law of nations is holden
now, no war requires to be pieceded by a. declaration Mar
tens, 27-1, 2d Wheaton's Laws of Nations, 12, 1st of Kent's
Commentaries, 54, 2d edition Defensive war never required
it, accoiding to any theoiy Vattel 317 But it was defensive
war to which McLeod's Government assured him that he was
summoned forth The want of declaration, theiefore, cannot
affect him, unless we aie guilty of the mdecentand ludicrous
barbarity of requiring him to judge better thtan his Government
on the nt cessity of resorting to a particular measure of armed
resistance to a thteatened invasion
1 submit then, sit that McLeod is not re^ponsth'e as foi
crime against the municipal law of New Yo k oi of this Union
ly participating m this act of Eighth national wiong Cri-
minal i.i E gland, in him it was no cume Let me add that if,
in thonght1 e--&ne^3 oi it ^pi wp had stooped to shed his blood,
if woul ' 1 ave impiessed a stain on theiadiant flag of out pude
and love wlu-iia hundred victones, ay, a hum'red years of
Yictorv, would not wipe away
The concession of the Secietary of State was right, then, m
1 oint of international law But 'h° Senatoi fiom Pennsylvania
thinks he ousht not to have made it, light ur wrong I submit,
then m th^ second plicf that ne ought to have made it, and
tht Government to Lave acted en it, exactly as it was made and

ten, I was just now told that the late Chief Masi-trate observed
toa fnend, some time duung that fleeting month of his Admt
nistiation, that m a just cause il Congress would give him
men and money, he had no objection to going into a war with
England, but that he could not bimg himself to buckle on his
aimoi and fake the field against Alexander McLeod I can ap
pieciatethe disinclination of the kind, biave, and justoldman
to such asavice
I lepeat, then, sir, that if, on the 12th of Maich, McLeod
had been awaiting trial in the courts of the United States, we
ought to have replied to the dtmand of her Majesty's. Mi-
nister thus We admit youi proposition of international law,
we are not quite so rude and recent among the nations as not
to know the elements or the code that knits the families of the
earth together. From this accusation of municipal offence you*-
subject is safe And now will you myoui turn inform us (for
three years we 1 ave waited n vain to kcow) on what pretence
her Majesty's forces, at the dead hour of night, ciossed the
mvioiate line of our boundaiy, invaded our soil, dishonored
oui fias:, wasted the piopertyand shed the blood oi American
citizens'*
It happened, howevei, tr/at at the time when th's demand
was made, McLeod was awaiting his tind ¡n the courts of New
York lie was m a New York prison, under New York pro
ees*, and the distinguished Senatoi from Penrsylvama insists
that for this cause, at least, the Qovernment should have done
nothing, and said nothing to the demand, bat just have directed
Mr Fox to tell his story md cairy his law toNewYoik We
should have made no concessions of the leeal principle, we
should not have dated to communicate to the Executive ol that
State the official evidence of the claim, and of the doctnne oí
England, and our own opinion of it, we should not have lifted
a finger, we should have smod speechless, unconscious, inno
cent, and dignified, to see England, New York, and McLt-od set
tie this little concern of national law, peace, war, life and
deatn among themselves
Sir, the position McLeod stood m to that ereat and admirable
State undoubte \\y iimiredth«ri'irhts1 and embairaased the action
of theCencil Government But, hecaU-e wc eonid not do all
that we Would were we not to do the little that we could1 Were
we to do nothing"7 Whom have w- offended7 The State of Isew

But we sought to o[ orate on the Government of that State by
