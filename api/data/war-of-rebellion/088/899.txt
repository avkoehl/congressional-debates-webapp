GENERAL: Two deserters from the Eighth Georgia Regiment, of Anderson's brigade, Field's division, were forwarded last evening from the Fifth Army Corps. Their statement was not sent in last evening through forgetfulness. They state that the two brigades of Field's division (Benning's and Gregg's) that have been of late on the north side of the James have rejoined their division, which is now on the south side the Appomattox on the extreme right of the enemy's line; that Anderson's brigade was not permanently attached to Wilcox's division, and still belongs to Field's division - all reports of the brigade are still made to General Field; that their new line extends as far as Reams' Station, but cannot definitely locate it - it is to prevent our advance on the South Side Railroad; that our deserters reported that we contemplated an advance on the South Side Railroad, and that the movements would be made on Friday, the 16th instant.

Very respectfully, your obedient,

JNO. C. BABCOCK.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
