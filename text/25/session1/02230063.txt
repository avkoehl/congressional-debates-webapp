restrictions and i emulate the action of State mstitu
uons1 That Congress, or the Executive, can do
this directly, no one will contend, and can w e effect,
by indirect means, what we have confessedly no
powei to accomplish by direct legislation t Can v e
use the funds of this Government to buy up State
institutions, for the purpose of moulding them ac-
cording to our will'? Asafnend of the rights of
the States, he must say hefeit alaimed at such doc-
trines The deposite bark system was resorted to
in 1833, m a gieat emergency, when the United
States Bank was attempting to crush the State in-
stitutions, and at that time was a wise, if not an in-
dispensable, measure, but the object of supenntend-
mg and reforming the Sta'e banks w as then no part of
the system It is now abandoned, and he rejoiced at
it, considering it impracticable, and resting on very
questionable principles
Whether, therefore, we look to the direct object
of the deposite bank system, the safe keeping and
disbursement of the levenue, or the incidental ad-
vantage of improving the currency, it was (Mr N
thought) not to be disputed that the measure had
failed The connexion between the Treasury and
the State banks is at an end, it has'been dissolved
by the banks thenxsel ves, and the only question now
is, whether it shall be renewed He, for one,
thought not
The deposite bank scheme being, as he consider-
ed, out of the question, there were but two plins re-
maining for the management of the finances The
first of these is anatior tlbank He did not know
that this exciting question would be ag.tated at this
time, there were some memorials, but no distinct
proposition, befoi e us in relation to it, and although
a national bank seemed to fall within the scope of
the piesent debate, he was not disposed to go into
s.ny general discussion of that question Of the
constitutional and political consideiations which
belonged to it, he would say nothing but he would
make a few suggestions on one or two financial
porsts Tne le establishment o( a national bank is

not as a fiscal agent of the Govtinme.it, it is not so
much for its capacity m facilitating commeicial
transactions that Congress is now appealed to to
establish another bank of the United States, but it
is asked for as a geiieial legiilaloi of tip cuirency of
the country; toiegulate, supenn'end, and control the
operations of the State banks It is on this ground
mainly, if not exclusively, that the mercantile com-
munity desire the re establishment of a national
bank
The Board of Trade of the city of New York, m
the circular which they hive sent all over the coun-
try, to set the friends of a United States Bank m
motion, say "Here aie -.eveial bundled banks,
with an indefinite powei to issue paper monev, and
twenty-seven legislatures, possessing indefinite
powei to create banks at ihen own will The banks
cannot control each othei, nor can the State legis-
latures control them, so that there is no efficient
check on the exercise of this immense power vpon
which every man's propel ty depends for its lolu , and
every man's labor for its tev ai d That their mstru
mentality has been useful, if not mdisoensablv noces
-sary, is willingly admitted, but to their safe admm-
isliatioi it iias eaily deemed essential that the (¡ol-
etnment, chatged with the cure of the circulating me
diiim, should, by mean'! of its revenue supcri/tlr/id,
and, to a certain, deg;~i cc, control their movements "
The Board of Tiadeof our great commeicial em
poreum mn be regarded as speaking the sentiments
of the commercial class generally in the countrv
and we see m the puohc papers, and every whcie,
the almost universal sentiment among the advo-
cates of a national bank, that it is the onlv''?cgulaloi
of the currency of the country, and it is to th° fail-
ure to renew the chattel of the late Bank of the I
United States that thev attnbu e the lapid increase
of banking institutions in the Sta'es the last few  |
yeais    Ii would be difiVult to use language more [
condemnatoiy   to the whole banking system than
that contained m the cncular of the Board ef Trade
What are we to think of " system vhich contains
within itself no sustaining 01 rest} latins; pnnaple?
Such an institution must have within itself the seeds
of destmction    What aie  we to think of banks
which cannot  control themselves, which cannot
control one  mo'her, and which cannot be cont1 oi-
led by the very power that crca*ed them 1
But this unmanageable machine) y of State banks
which possesses within itself the veiv piinuples ot
disorder, is to be conti oiled and regulated bj a na
lional bank, so asj to render 4 highly useful    That
a large and very respectable portion of the commu-
nity honestly entertained this opinion, tan hardly
be disputed But it appeared to him w ithout anj
foundation m theoiy, and not only unsupported,
but directly opposed to all experience both m thi.
country and England How are one set of banks
(for a national bank with numerous branches is,
lor most purposes, only so many independent insti-
tutions) constructed on the same pnncip'es, and
moved by the same impulses and motives, to con-
trol and legulate another set of banks every way
similar' 11 we examine the position and the rea-
sons a priori, it appears to have no support, and if
we view it m the lights of experience, it seemed to
him strange that such an opinion should evei have
prevailed to the extent it has
The strong reason now urged for anational bank,
was, in his opinion, one of the greatest objections
to such an institution That a national bank has
and necessarily must exert great power ov er many
of the smaller institutions of the States, was a point
not to be controverted But the question is, whether
this influence tends to give stability to the paper
currency, or increase its fluctuations 1 What are
the evils of our paper currency, and indeed of all
papei cuirenciest Its tendency to excess and its
ruinous fluctuations, or penodical and almost ton
stant expansions and contractions Is it not appa
rent that the concentrated power of agreat mstitu
tion, opeiatmg upon this floating mass, mikt agi
tale and keep it in constant commotion 1 And do
we not know, in point of fact, that all the great and
distressing revulsions in this country since 1816,
were preceded by large expansions bv the United
States Bank1 Was not this the case in 1817, and
the first half of 1818 ' From July, 1817, to Teh
íuary, 1818, the discounts of the bank were m
cieased about twenty millions of dolíais, 01 neailv
one hundred per cent This preceded, and in no
small degree contribuid, to the ev ere embarrass
ments and dis ress which follow ed, and w Inch laste I

during 1 25, vv1 lea í v oied the specuialirns m cot
ton, and led to an excess of imports over the pre-
ceding yeais of tw enty five or thirty per cent The
bank, having increased its discounts m 1831, cur
tailed and brought on a piessitre in 1832, and oc-
casioned an ext ess of importations m 1831 of
moie than forty per cent over the ten preceding
years, with the exception of 1825 The contra"1
tion of about twenty millions after the removal
of the deposites m 1833 it is well known, brought
on the sevei e pressure and panic of 1834
Yet, with these facts staring us in the face it is
seriously contended that a national ban^ is the
onlv regula'orit the tuircncv tnltheonl^ tl 114
calculated to íes inn an I check the action of the
lo al institution" He considered a hauonal bank
dangerous and pernicious nndei any circumstan
ces, buthe should feci much less objection to it
it its notes formed the only paper cuirency In
that cae, we should only be exposed to its ovvn
contractions and expansions but w ith our present

power of Congress was to mteidiqt the paper of
such banks as do not pay specie frtom beirg re-
ceived al the custom-house "
Mr N said these sentiments were sound, and he
fnllj concurred m t! em, if true and applicable to
the cims m 1816, they were equally so now And
how did the remedy adopted, a national bank,
restoie to life the "mortified mass" of paper
money 1 Why, m the same manner that a surgeon
saves the hie of a patient by extensive amputa-
tions, an arm, a leg, leaving nothing but the dis-
membered trunk If, m that case, the patient sur-
vived, his sufferings were great, and for nearly
three yeais he languished m a low and feeble state.
The contraction of currency was the most rapid
and extensive, and attended by consequences the
most afflicting and calamitous of which there are,
pei haps, any examples in modern times
Of the one hnnarid and ten millions of paper
money which was in circulation in 1816, all was
annihilated but forty five millions, according to the
authority of Mr Crawford But even this de-
struction of moie than sixty per cent of the
depreciated mass of papei did not give soundness
to what lemamed, until the lapse of nearly four
vears Inarepoit made in 1820, Mr Crawford
sav s, ' that m many of the States, the great mass
of the cuirency is not even ostensibly convertible,"
and l1,at, in a " great part of the Union, the con-
vertibility of paoer was lather nominal than real."
Of the deep and extensiv e distress which this pro-
cess of restoring the currency occasioned, he says,
"all intelligent writers upon eunency agiee,
that when it is decreasing in amount, poveity and
miseiy must pieiail The correctness of the opin-
ion is too manifest to require proof' The muted
voice of the nation attests us accuracy As^there
is no recorded example, in the history of nations,
of a 1 eduction of the currency st rapid and so ex-
ten ive, so but few examples have occurred of
distress so geneial and so severe as thru which has
been e--minted 111 the UntedSla'es To the evils

ficient, 1" is still depreciated As the cuirency, at
least 111 some parts of the Union, is depreciated, it
must, m those parts, suffe) a further 1 eduction be-
fore it becomes sound The nation must continue
to suffer until this is effected "
Such was the picture ol distress exhibited at the
end of four vears after the establishment of the
United States Bank, which is regarded by some as
a universal panacea, or sovereign íemedy, for all
disoideis in commercial and monetary affairs
Like a paaent slovvlv lecov einig from a fever, the
