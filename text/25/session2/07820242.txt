deep, with those that preceded them the day before,
all repotted by the Committee of Claims, many of
them, I suspect, the offspring of the goodness of
their heaits rather than the el°amess of their
heads
Tne Committee of Claims repot t $10,000 for the
1 -lief of A B, another of ^20,000 for the relief ol C
D another of §30,000 for the relief of KT another
of sJ40 000 lor the relief of G II, and «0 on to the

Sir, if ill the claims now on our tables, icpoited
