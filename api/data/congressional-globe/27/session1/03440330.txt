Mr   HU"VT   after romplimenting the chairman of the Tudt

mittee, pr iceed to  remark   upon the condition iflu^own dis

hal   petitnne 1 in fivor  of the bill, not only   fiom motives of
compassion, but from an   enlaiged view of their own true in
terests
He made some general remarks on the beneficial tendencies
of a general bankiupt law, as experienced in other countries,
and na necessity here, as a permanent provision in our com
mercial system He adverted to the revulsions to which our
business had been subjected, and to the large proportion of
bankruptcies which occurred amonsr our business men, as
compared with the state of things in Great Britain, where the
number of buch cases did not exceed iwenty tlnee per cent of
the whole business community, while heie they reached fae
appalmg, the frightful average of ninety seven per cent This
was not to be traced to any defect in the morals ofthe coramu
nity, but to apathy m our legislators A pioperly named
bankrupt law was of all things best calculated to check over
trading, and thus dimmish the number of insolvencies Suitable
legislation on this subject would restore our charactei asabusi-
ness people to respect abroad, where it now labored undei
suspicion Mr H then argued the mipoliey of including
banking corporations in the bill
Mi POPE observed that there seemed a very decided dts
position to pass thit. bill, and he therefore leltbound to state
that it contained some principles which, if he rightly under
siood them, he never could endorse    The voluntary portion
of the bill, as it had been called, seemed to be the most popu
lar, but to him it seemed to be in hostility with the Constttu
«on   oi at least wholly  unsupported by that  instrument    It
went to affect all existing contracts, and to interfere with the
relations of debtor and cieditor    As to hone&t debtors, after
some  observation   he rould  say that   he never had   known
them to be treated with oppression by creditors    Imprison
ment for debt he had always been opposed to, he consider d
it «s utteily opposed to  the genius oí  our Government and
the charactei of  oui   people, noi   did he believe that much
was cvei made out of a compulsory surrendei of the debtor's,
goods, oi from the estate of a bankrupt    If he was called on to
give a title to this bill, he should call it a bill foi the benefit of
lawyers, commissioners, a&signees, clerks, sheriffs, and then
associates and dependants, these, he believed, would be the pei
sons who would make the most out of it, while neither debtors
nor ciedttors would get much of the-spoils    Though young at
the time, he had witnessed the practical effects of the law of
1800, and had seen large estates eaten up by lawyers and others
appointed to take the charge of them, while neither creditor
noi debtor m the end got one dollar of the proceeds
lie objected to the bill as bringing creditois within the pins
diction ofthe Ted eral courts, winch often sat one or two nun
died mile^ of! fiom then homes, this never had been intend
ded by the Constitution The junsdiction of these courts
ought to be confined to matters of a national character, oi to
cases between citizens of diffeient States, but never were m

State A debtor might diaw all his immediate neighbors, to
whom he wis m debt, away to a Federal court two hundred
miles distant Tarmeib would be slow in tackling up then
wagons on such a journey, and would lather nsk the lossof

receiving notice that the man was a bankrupt It might en

likely to get much good by it The best way, in general, was
to leave a debtor alone, he was likely to make ten times more for
lu^ creditois than when bunted by sheriffs and fleeced bylaw
yeis The fine pictuies, uken from novels, of the cruelty of
non h ai ted creditors over poor md honest debtois had mighty

them    IA laugh 1
i hue wis me question which I iy at the threshold of this
bilí, and whu h he win ted thechaumanof the Judiciary Com
mitt* e who had introduced the bill, [Mr Barnard,] to answer
Did he tontend tint the United States. General Government
could nullify acon'iact between individuals'2
Mi BARNARD replied that he was not for nullification
in any shape, but he held that the Government had power in
the case of bankruptcy, to di&chaige a contiact from its legal
effect
Mi POPEiephed Now I undei stand you and I deny that
the Govei nment has any such power Mi P went on to ar
gue the constitutional question, insisting that no such powci
had ever he n delegated to Congress All the States had, m
then several State Constitutions, expressly declared that no hw
should be pa^ed impamng the obligation of contracts, and it
wouid be mo t extiaotdinaiy that they should confer such a
power on Congies-s It never was intended I ven the onini
potenceof the Bntish Paihament dare not attempt ¡su cha thins
It would be a violation of the magna charta, which declaied
thesacrtdne  of piivate propeity Could the gentleman pro
duce a single instance wheie such a power had been exeicised
or claimed'*
Mr BARNARD said he could, and he would instance the
whole bankrupt sy-tem of England for the laa thiee hundied
years, by which contiacts weie just as much, andnomoie abro
gated than waspioposed to be done by this bill
Mr POPE challenged Mr BARNARD to the is^ue and after
some explanations between Me=¡¡,r& POPE, BARNARD, and
TERRIS,
Mi POPL conti nded tint a bankrupt law was needed only
by commeuial men, and in rommeicul conceras This had
been the chaiacter of ¡he bill of 1800, and so had been the un
deist indm°"evei since, till this extra írdmai y bill, which lie m
sis ed contained some of the greatest enormities be had ever
seen attempted in legislation
[The committee i >se informally, to enable the ITou=e to re-
ceiveaiepou by Mi Randoiph from ti e Committee on En-
rolled Bills, who íepotted that ihe ronarm tee had examimdthe
bill to provide foi the pavment of nav) pensions, and had found
the same to be coirect, whereupon the bill received the s gna
tne of the hpeaker And the Chan man again nsumed his
seat ]
Mr AILEN of Mune briefly addie sed the committee, and
was veiy indistinct!) heaid owniitot e lemoteness of lus po
sition fiom the Reporter He was undei stood howevei to say
that he believed Congtcssto pos&ess the onstuutional power
to pass a bankrupt law and that the language of the Consutu
tion was plain and emphatic on the subject, yet, notwHbstand
ing such was the fact theie were gentlemen in that H>use who
had undeitaken to expiess their doubts as to the power of
Congress to eim t a buikrupi law Now, looking at the argu
ments which bad i een i Ivancedby the opponents of this mea
sure, he hid almost brought his mind to the conclusion that
none no matter what i s chaiacter might be, could be mtio
ducedhere, without beina disputed on constitutional aiounds
Believing, then that Congress had the constitutional power to
elassa bankiupt act, the only question, which .remained to be
consirjeied was, whether or no' it was e\pedient or propei to
