Brigadier General W. S. WALKER,

Commanding, Pocotaligo, S. C.:

GENERAL: Your letter of yesterday has been received. The views continued in it are approved by me. Should the enemy succeed in taking the trestle work over the Savannah River and you can still hold the railroad line to this place, you must of course do so, for future operations. All your movements must look to the final defense of Charleston, where I shall concentrate all my troops when required at that point.

Should the enemy succeed in taking Coosawhatchie or Pocotaligo, any strong position giving us still command of the railroad tot his place must be held until further orders for future operations against the enemy should he endeavor to march toward Branchville, which will have to be protected by a part of your cavalry and one or two sections of artillery moving in that direction.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
