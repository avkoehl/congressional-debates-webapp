Thirty-Eighth Congress, 2d Session.
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1, 1865.
Series No. 76.
current year will amount to ยง344,000,000 is ex-
cessive to the extent of $40,000,000.
The last and most vital measure is the reduc-
tion of the circulating medium. I said that I was
willing to agree to the issue of Treasury notes,
with the understanding that they should go into
the circulation of the country to the extent of
$25,000,000 or $50,000,000; but, sir, on reflec-
tion, I am not prepared to stand by the proposi-
tion. The increase of the currency increases prices
to a corresponding extent; and you will have to
pay, in the increased expenses of the Govern-
ment, a sum equal to the amount added to the
circulation of the country. If you increase the
circulation of the country $25,000,000, you will
find that the expenses of the Government will be
exactly in the same ratio, to say nothing of the
hardships that will be inflicted on the great body
of the people. In other words, you will have to
pay $25,000,000 for the use of $25,000,000 for one
year. If the House and country will come to the
conclusion to pay all liabilities, and that they shall
be redeemed, principal and interest, in coin, and
then go into the markets of the world, we can
carry the country through without difficulty.
Mr.STEVENS. Atwhatrate would our bonds
sell abroad ?
Mr. BOUTWELL. If you will take the forty-
years' bonds, principal and interest payable in
gold, they can be negotiated to the extent of
$100,000,000. I make that statement from some
knowledge of what foreign bankers have ex-
pressed a desire to do.
Mr. PRUYN. I understand that ourcurrency
of all kinds amounts to $675,000,000.
Ti>e question recurred on Mr. Wilson's amend-
ment, and it was disagreed to.
Mr. HIGBY. I move to strike out the last
section.
Mr. Chairman, the details of our financial af-
fairs I leave to those more familiar with them than
I am. I move to strike out to make a few re-
marks on a point on which little has been said,
but which I know is largely in the minds of gen-
tlemen. I can hardly say what I desire to say in
five minutes, but I can say it in ten minutes. But"
if we are acting under the five-minute rule I sup-
pose I cannot go over that time.
The member from New York [Mr. Fernando
Wood] last evening, in the lengthy remarks he
made, spoke upon a point which is prominently
in the minds of every member of this House; and
in this legislation I have no doubt that the great
mass of the members upon this floor have faith,
sincere faith, that the great debtof the country can
be paid directly from the mineral lands belonging
to the country. In that, sir, their hopesand then-
faith are utterly false. The gentleman said last
evening that he had urged that this Government
should take possession of the mineral lands as
belonging to the Government. And I have no
doubt, if there were to be a direct expression of
opinion, that two thirds or three fourths of the
members upon this floor would say that that is
their opinion upon this subject; and I have no
doubt that this legislation is being based upon the
idea I have presented. If I did not believe that
the finances of the country would be perfectly
safe as based upon the wholesome financial con-
dition of the country in all the departments from
which the country draws its resources, I would
not for one moment give my support to this bill,
because the very foundation upon which it is
based would be entirely false.
The Government take possession of the mineral
lands! Why, sir, the Government would be like
the man who drew the elephant in the lottery; he
got a very big thing, but when he got it he did
not know what to do with it. The Government
take possession of the mineral lands! The miners
on the mineral lands,.before they would pay over
and aboye the past expenses they have incurred,
I have no doubt would tell the Government to
take the mineral lands and work them. Every
miner, and every man who is acquainted experi-
mentally with the business operations of mining,
would say that the Government in running these
70
mines would find itself after a few years with a
far greater debt upon its hands than it had when
it commenced. Go upon th$ idea (hat because
such a vastamount of gold and silver is taken out
of these lands, therefore the Government should
take those lands! Why, sir, the leaving these
lands free has encouraged the spirit of adventure
and sent thousands and thousands of men to hard
labor who otherwise would never have moved in
that direction. That, and that alone, has given
rise to the vast amount of exploring and pros-
pecting which has opened up these store-houses
of wealth. From one third to one half of the la-
bor and expense of mining is bestowed in first
finding where the hidden treasure lies. One half
the expense is incurred by the miner before he
receives any return for his labor. I would like
every member of this House to go with me from
mining locality to mining locality throughout the
mineral district, that they might see the vast
amount of labor which has been bestowed in this
way, and every man would say that the miners
deserve all they can get from those places winch
they have explored, and upon which they have
made such vast expenditures.
Gentlemen may then say that the unexplored
lands should be divided up and sold out. Then
I would remind gentlemen that to develop these
unexplored lands would cost the same amount of
labor and capital before they would be placed
in the same condition as the present developed
territory.
I desired to say this much simply because this
subject has been agitated, and m some future
Congress will culminate in final action. I have
thrown out these remarks for the consideration
of members who will have seats upon this floor
in the next Congress, that they may consider them
in the mean time.
I withdraw my motion.
Mr. HOOPER. I move that the committee
rise for the purpose of terminating debate.
Mr. COX. Before that is done 1 desire to say
a word.
Mr. HOOPER. I yield to the gentleman.
Mr. COX. i desire to say one word in rela-
tion to the remark which fell from the lips of my
friend [Mr. Ingersoll] in reference to repudia-
tion. I do not think he comprehended the re-
marks which fell from the gentleman from New
York, [Mr. Brooks.] If he had I do not think,
as a western man, he would have answered it
precisely in the way he did. 1 understood the
argument of the gentleman from New York to be
that if the interest upon our bonds are made pay-
able in coin and the custom-houseduties are made
payable in coin, the operation of it, under our
present infamous and outrageous tariff", would
compel our western people to investigate this fis-
cal question; and on investigation, unless they
found relief, they would have it in some other
form, perhaps repudiation.
Mr. 1NGERSOLL. Doesthegentleman from
Ohio assert that under any circumstances the peo-
ple of the western States will repudiate the law-
ful debt of the Government?
Mr. COX. 1 do not believe that they will.
Mr. 1NGERSOLL. All right.
Mr. COX. I believe that during the next five
years there will be such floods of light poured in
upon these fiscal questions that we will revolu-
tionize and. save this country from repudiation,
and anarchy, and ruin to both rich and poor as a
consequence. I never will lisp a word in favor
of repudiation. I know that credit is cash and
that cash is everything. Itis greater than morals.
The great questions in this country are economic
questions; and those are the questions that are
hereafter to agitate this country and topple from
power the present Administration.
Mr. MOORHEAD. How will we get light
on these subjects when the gentleman goes out
of Congress? [Laughter.]
Mr. COX. If my friendhad only read arather
elaborate speech which I made on the tariff last
session, and especially upon the iron interest of
Pennsylvania, he would have Had such a uoou of
light on his head that it would have struck him
Willi an epileptic fit. [Laughter.]
Mr. MOORHEAD. 1 did not see it.
Mr. COX. That ia because the gentleman did
not look for it. It proved that the iron mongers
of his State were receiving from one hundred and
fifty to two hundred percent, of the hard earn'-
ings of industry, because, as was well said yes-
terday by a Republican Senator, all these taxes
at last will be paid in gold, and wrung from the
sweat of industry. All your wealth, all your
shoddy demands are, after all, nothing but the
beaded sweat from the brow of labor, and in the
end labor will seelc its proper position in tha
country, and then capital mustlook out.
Mr. Chairman, I shall at the proper time, when
the tariff bill comes up, offer my old amendment
which thegentlemaii from Vermont [Mr.MoRRiL]
last year said was so so absurd, and which I have
not yet learned was absurd, providing that all our
customs duties shall be paid in currency and not
in the specie of the country. That will strike off
at one fell swoopneaily one hundred and fifty per
cent, ofihe bounties paid by western industry to
eastern capital, and which in the end goes into the
hands of the bondholders, who live mostly in the
eastern States. When the gentleman from Illi-
nois says that the West will never repudiate, I
join with him in that; but when he comes up and
says that this oppression is still to continue and
that the West is to be mortgaged more and more,
and more drawn from them, and that the West
will still come up and loot the whole bill for fear of
repudiation, 1 do not go wiih him there. The West
will not foot the bill exclusively. We want fair,
just, and equal taxation, and that taxes shall fall
like the dews of Heaven alike upon the rich and
ihe poor. I now, in accordance with ray promise,
move that the committee do now rise for the pur-
pose of closing debate.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose; and the Speaker having
resumed the chair, Mr. Littejobn reported that
the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union had, according to order, had under consid-
eration bill of the House No. 772, to provide ways
and means for the support of the Government, and
hod come lo no conclusion thereon.
Mr. HOOPER. I move that all debate in Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union on
the special order close in one minute after the con-
sideration shall be resumed by the committee.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. HOOPER. 1 now move that the rules be
suspended, and that the House resolve itself into
the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union.
The motion was agreed to.
So the rules were suspended, and the House ac-
cordingly resolved itself the into Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr. Little-
jobn in thechair,) and resumed the consideration
of the special order.
The CHAIRMAN stated the pendingquestion
to be upon the substitute for the bill offered by Mr.
Stevens. , ,
Mr. STEVENS. As we have got through
with the amendments offered with the exception
of my substitute, I will withdraw the substitute
and offer it again in the House when the commit-
tee rises; that coursewill save time,and the com-
mittee eon now rise.
Mr. BROOKS. Before the committee rises, I
would ask the gentleman from Massachusetts if
it is necessary that we should appropriate this
ยง60,000 for further printing of notes; and if two
or three million have not already been appropriated
for the purpose.
Mr. STEVENS. I suppose that if it be deemed
necessary we can continue this discussion in the
House. I therefore withdraw my substitute, arid
move that the committee rise and report the bill.
Mr. DAVIS, of Maryland. I havean amend-
ment which I desire to offer as an additional sec-
tion. _ , .
Mr. STEVENS. That can be offered in the
Hi use.
