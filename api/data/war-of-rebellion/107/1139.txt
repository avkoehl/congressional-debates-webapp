HDQRS. THIRTEENTH Regiment VIRGINIA VOL. INFANTRY,Brbousville, W. Va., January 10, 1864.

Colonel W. R. BROWN:

SIR: In obedience to your order I left this place on the 30 th of December with 200 men, to ascertain, if possible, the whereabouts of the rebels which were lately in the vicinity of Hurricane Bridge. We passed through the country between this and Wayne Court-House, and found that they were camping in the neighborhood of Wayne Court-House. I found it impossible to force them to fight, as they were well mounted and appeared to be only disposed to interrupt us by harassing our advance and rear guards. I ascertained the rebel force to be composed of the Sixtheenth Regiment Virginia Volunteers, under Colonel Ferguson, numbering from 30 to 500. I would have remained out longer but for the want of rations and the sudden change in and inclemency of the weather, which rendered it impossible for the men to march.

Very respectfully,

JAMES. R. HALL,

[33.] Lieutenant-Colonel Thirteenth Virginia Volunteer Infantry.
