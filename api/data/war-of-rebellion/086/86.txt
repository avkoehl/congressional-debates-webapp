under good officers, who will ride from end to end of the line. General Smith will move to Dunksburg, leaving part of a bridge at Sedalia to follow, on being relieved by brigade from La Mine bridge.

SEDALIA, October 18, 1864--6.15 p. m.

(Received 6.30 p. m.)

Major-General ROSECRANS, Jefferson City:

A report from La Mine bridge states that a party of rebels, some 250 strong, camped last night near Green Walker's, and moved eastward this morning in the direction of Roadcap's Mills, on Saline Creek, some five miles north of Syracuse; supposed to be Todd's command. I directed, this morning, 300 of Simonson's cavalry to report for duty at La Mine Creek, and I think they should be kept at Tipton to protect the railroad from that point both ways. We also need some troops at Syracuse and California, for the rebels evidently now intend to damage the road behind us.

Major-General.

SEDALIA, October 18, 1864--7.15 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS, Jefferson City:

One of our citizen scouts captured three rebel conscripts near Muddy Creek to-day. They state that Price's main force was to leave Waverly this morning for Lexington; that Price had his headquarters at Waverly when they left yesterday. None of the rebel main force is this side of the Blackwater, but the country is full of small squads of five or six rebel scouts. They thought their army intended moving westward, but were not certain.

Major-General.

SEDALIA, October 18, 1864--7.30 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS, Jefferson City:

Dispatch of 5.30 p. m. received. Shall carry out your instructions as quickly as possible. Have not heard of Winslow, but suppose he can be reached by courier. The road to Warrensburg is good. Could telegraph yesterday from here there. Am trying now. Have sent fifty men to guard a tank on the road eleven miles from here. There are no militia here. Fifty men are all I can raise of them. Telegraph line is down to Warrensburg. Am sending a party through now.

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S.--Fords of Blackwater at Dunksburg and Brownsville and one between are good.

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General.

Parties from Warrensburg, left last night, state no troops were there then.

Major-General.
