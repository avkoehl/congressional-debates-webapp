HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION, Near Petersburg, July 2, 1864.

COLONEL: By direction of Major-General Johnson I have the honor to submit the following report for the last twenty-four hours:

Brigadier-General Gracie reports that his command has been actively engaged in strengthening his works, principally to the left of the branch. A Yankee was wounded and brought into his line last night. The only information elicited from him was that he belonged to the Second Maryland Regiment, Ninth Corps. Johnson's brigade have placed palisades in front of their line; the enemy seem to be strengthening their rifle-pits. Colonel Faison, commanding Ransom's brigade, reports nothing of interest on his line during the past twenty-four hours. The intrenchment thrown up on the left of his line, parallel to the railroad, to guard against an advance up the railroad, was completed last night. Brigadier-General Elliott reports the works upon Pegram's battery steadily advancing. There was heavy picket-firing upon his line about 11 o'clock last night, which was drawn by a volley from the enemy's rifle-pits; it ceased in a few moments; there was no advance.

The following list of casualties within the last twenty-four hours is respectfully submitted: Elliott's brigade, killed, 4; wounded, 9. Ransom's brigade, wounded, 5. Gracie's brigade, killed, 2; wounded, 3. Johnson's brigade, killed, 1; wounded, 4. Total, 7 killed; 21 wounded.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,R. E. FOOTE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
