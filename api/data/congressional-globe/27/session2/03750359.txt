The CHAIRMAN then resumed his seat in committee, and
Mr  MARSHALL proceeded in his remarks, as above given.
When Mr Mabshall had concluded—
Mr WISE said he intended to reply, both to the gentleman
from Kentucky [Mr Masshaix! and to the chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means, two oí the most able gen-
tlemen m the House he had got on his head, two Richmond^
were m the field He would begin with the fatter gentlemaa
of the two, the honorable chairman ol the Committee of Ways
and Means That gentleman was one of the most eloquent
gentleman in the history of delay lie had ever «een in this
House He had given them the first and second edition, one in
boards and, he would not say the othei 111 calf, of the history of
the delay in this House, but he must say of the gentleman
when they brought him to action he was like another peculiar
animal which has talons even longer than a tigers Here
they were with the íules of the House requiring appiopm-
tion bills to be reported in the first thirty days ol the session,
ar d they h id now nearly 1 eached the 1st of April and he had
lepoited a bill to pay themselves Why was it that when the
gent eman was so eloquent on the history of delay, he should
so delay in aUiont He had been here and seen man after
man at the head of the Com nittoe of Ways and leans, he
had watched gentlemen of all parties, he had seen a Polk,
noted for hi  industry, a Cambrelenc, a Jone% but greater
than all according to his ov> 11 account, was the piesent, incum-
bent of that immortal place He I ad done—what? Whyeverjr
time that he could he had moved to go into Committee of the
Whole to take up the bill' That was the sum total Tli^
mostindustuousmantostarttodosometh.Bghe had ever met:
with in hslife, but as yet, out of four or five months, 1 e had
consummated one hill, to pay himself, among others, his per
diem What was his excuse foi this delay? Ho had stated aa
a fact that six men m this House had opposed him—six men
who were the convenient butt of the jeers and jests of every
willing in this House and out of it when these six men, toge-
thei with thi. Dei locintic party, could not equal that gentle-
trail s party by some twenty votes It was to he believed that
these iv men were si pttential it mti t be, as his inend fiom.
