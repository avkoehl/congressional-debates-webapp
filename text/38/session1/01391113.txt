1864.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
1113
eign Relations.has strengthened the views which
induced me to propose that amendment. J desire
to call the attention of the Senate very briefly to
the question that is before the body.
Under the act of 1856 tlie President of the Uni-
ted States has the power to say that this shall be
a full mission; but he can only say it by giving
to the minister a salary of $10,000 a year. That
minister now has a salary of $7,500. By the ex-
ercise of this power the President may increase
the pay ยง2,500 a year. Now, was it a good pol-
icy or was it a bad policy which was adopted in
1856? Was it well to say that the President of
the United States, who is presumed to have an
intimate knowledge of our foreign relations', should
possess the power to say whether the minister
should be a minister resident or a full minister?
It is presumed that the President of the United
States kftows very intimately and accurately the
relations between this Government and any par-
ticular Government of Europe, and the delicacy
and importance of the questions that arise be-
tween the two Governments. The Senator now
tells us that the questions between us and Belgium
are inferior to the questions between us and no
.other Government of Europe except France and
England.
Mr. SUMNER. I said the " interests." That
was the word I used.
Mr. HENDRICKS. Then the interests in
charge of the minister to Belgium are as import-
ant as the interests confided to our minister at St.
Petersburg, at Madrid, or at Berlin; and yet, the
Senator says that the minister who has charge of
these important interests ought to have but $7,500,
while the other ministers are getting from ten to
twelve thousand five hundred dollars a year. Is
the Senate to consider on a question of ยง2,500,
and depart from the policy that was adopted in
185G? If we raise the rank of this ministei, we
ought to give him the $2,500 additional. This
Government is not so poor that it cannot pay ljim
that addition. Certainly, we are not willing to
say by the passage of this bill that the Govern-
ment is so embarrassed in its finances that it will
raise the rank because of the importance of the
mission, and yet it cannot afford to raise the pay
$2,500.
I am in favorof leavingitwhere theactofl856
has left it. If our interests at that court are so
important and so delicate, let the President of the
United States say so, and let him give the minister
$10*000 a year. It is not too much. While I am
in favor of economy, I am not in favor of com-
mencing it at foreign courts. I like to see the
Government of the United States well represented
abroad; 1 take a pride, as a citizen of the United
States, in that respect; and I want to see ourmin-
isters paid such handsome salaries that they can
bear themselves as the representatives of one of
the first Powers of the world. If we raise this
rank, let us give the man some respectable pay.
It may be that the argument is all right that it
ought to be a first-class mission; but certainly it
follows inevitably from that argument that he
ought to have the pay of a first-class minister;
and if that be the conclusion, leave it with the
President, where the policy of 1856 left it.
Mr. SUMNER. If wehad not at this moment
an army of more than half a million of men m the
field, and were not calling upon ourpeople to con-
tribute by taxation or by loans to the suppoit of
this war, I should agree with the Senator from
Indiana, and insist that in raising this mission to
Belgium we should also raise the salary. But, sir,
we are in the midst of war, for the support of
which we are exposed to unparalleled draftsupon
the Treasury; and precisely on this account I am
unwilling to aid in raising any of our salaries
abroad, especially those of a diplomatic character.
That is my precise answer to the argument of
the Senator from Indiana, and I believe he will
confess it is asufficientanswer. Suppose we be-
gin, where shall we end? Js the Senator aware
of the applications for increase of salaries that
have been made from persons in the foreign ser-
vice? There is hardly one abroad who has not
made complaint, either officially or unofficially,
on thisaccount. ThereareSenatorsonthisfloor
who have letters from those with whom they are
personally acquainted in Europe, urging that their
salaries should be raised. I havesuehletters. I
know well that there are many of them at the De-
partment of State. Indeed the Secretary has as-
sured me that there is hardly one hi the foreign
service who has not made his complaint to the De-
partment. The conclusion to which he was driven
was that the subject must not be touched. You
cannot undertake to raise one without being con-
strained to meet the question why you do not
raise another, and indeed the door would be
opened to raise all. It was precisely on this ac-
count that the Committee on Foreign Relations
taking the whole subject into consideration,feel-
ing that the case of Belgium was exceptional, un-
dertook to make aif exceptional proposition,
namely, to raise the grade withoutraisingthe sal-
ary, and in making this proposition they humbly
believed that they performed a patriotic duty. In
presenting it to the Senate, as the organ of that
committee, I did not anticipate the opposition
which it has encountered, and especially the tone
of this debate. I have presented it from the be-
ginning to the end on its merits; and on its merits
alone 1 ask your votes.
Mr. CONNESS. I willnotenterupon the dis-
cussion of this subject; but as 1 have a vote to
cast, and intend to castitaffirmatively on this prop-
osition, I desire to state that in casting that vote I
shall be governed by the recommendation of the
Committee op Foreign Relations. On questions
involving the expenditure of money I would or-
dinarily, in fact 1 may say universally, follow the
lead of the chaii man of the Committee on Finance
of this body; but I do not fear this proposition as
one that will be followed by any demand for an
increase of salary; and while I am up I will say
that if it should be followed by a demand for an
increase of the general salary paid to ministers
resident 1 would not fail to support it to that ex-
tent; and I would, in \iew of the considerations
presented by the chairman of the Committee on
Foreign Relations, feel that I was simply doing
an economical and piopcrduty in giving such a
vote. In giving this vote, however,! will not be
governed by the consideration of money, but sim-
ply by a desire to maintain the position taken and
the views presented so ably and forcibly by the
very able Committee on Foreign Relations.
Mr, GRIMES. It is very true, as has been
said by the chairman of the Committee on For- <
eign Relations, that probably nearly every mem-
ber of this body has received letters from his
friends who are enjoying the position of consuls
or mimsteis abroad, lequesting that some effort
may be made to increase their salaries and to in-
crease their grade; but here is an invidious dis-
tinction attempted to be made by the Committee
on foreign Relations, it strikes me. Mr. San-
ford, who happens to be minister residentof this
Government at Belgium, procures leave of ab-
sence from the Secretary ofState or the President,
and comes here, and immediately or very soon
after reaching this Government, a proposition is
made foi his benefit and for the benefit of nobody
else, so far as I know.
Mr. SUMNER. Will the Senator allow me
to interrupt him just there? The proposition 1
have had.the honor of moving was voted upon and
adopted in the Committee on Foreign Relations
several weeks, I think, before it was known even
that Mr. Sanford was on the way to this country.
I can assure the Senator that I had no idea that
Mr. Sanford was coming when I first submitted
this proposition to the committee. j
Mr. GRIMES. 1 am very happy to hear the ]
explanation made by the Senator from Massachu-
setts, for 1 apprehend that without that explana-
tion there would have been a perfect avalanche of
these foreign ministers and consuls upon the com-
mittee.
Mr. DAVIS. Will the gentleman permitme?
I understand that that proposition was submitted
to the committee this morning and voted upon by i
the committee this morning.
Mr. SUMNER. It was discussed in committee ,
this morning. I do not know that it is according ]
to the rules to speak of what passed in commit- i
tee; but my impression is that I submitted this !
proposition to the committee two months ago. ,
The Senator from Wisconsin, [Mr. Doolittle,] ,
who is on the committee, will remember better :
than I do, but I think it was about two months j
ago. ' !
Mr. DAVIS. I admit that the proposition has
been for some time before the committee. To be j
sure, I have been very irregular in my attendance j
upon the committee, but I have never known it i
to be submitted and voted upon decidedly until
this morning, ^ ; ,
Mr. SUMNER. The Senator, I know, desires
to have the fact stated as it is, I assure the Sen-
ator that it was submitted and voted up'pn long
since.
Mr. DAVIS. Why was it repeated this mow
ing?
Mr. SUMNER. It was repeated this morning
on account of the discussion yesterday. We
were in committee this morning, and reference
was made, naturally enough, perhaps, to the dis-
cussion of the day before. The Senator was
present and knows what passed.
Mr. GRIMES. Of course I do notknow what
has occurred in the committee,and Iamnotanx-
ious to know; I only know this fact, and the
country knows it, that almost simultaneously
with the arrival of Mr. Sanford from the court to
which he was accredited by this Government, a
proposition is made in -the Senate to amend a
House bill so as to raise his grade from that of a
resident minister to a minister plenipotentiary.
That is a fact that is patent to the world, and
from which the country would be disposed to
judge of this proposition, and from which our
other foreign ministers'and consuls would judge.
Mr. Sanford comes here, and this proposition is
made, and where does it come from ?
Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts
has attempted to impress upon the Senate that
our interests in Belgium are quite as important as
they are m any country save France and England.
Mr. SUMNER. At this moment.
Mr. GRIMES. Is this so? Why is it so?
Has the Senatorstated any reason? Tasked him
the reason, but he failed to give any. It is true
that Leopold, the sovereign of Belgium, has here-
tofore been S. kind of arbitrator between our and
other Governments, in relation to disputes that
existed between us and those Governments; and
why? Was it because he was a powerful mon-
arch, because he ruled in a country that possessed
great power and force?- No; but because of its
wry insignificance. He was an honest man, it
was believed; he was an intelligent man; but his
Government was so exceedingly insignificant on
the face of Europe that it had not been mixed up
or connected with any of the great continental
questions that separated Russia from Prussia, or
Prussia from Austria, or England from France,
or France from Spain. That was the reason why
our interests have been with that Government.
Now, is it proposed-to submit any further arbi-
trations to King Leopold ? Is there any proba-
bility that our interests are to continue to be of
so much moment at his Government? If they
are not, why do you propose to raise this mission
instead of the one at Copenhagen, or the one at
Stockholm, or the one at the Hague, or the one
at Portugal? with either one of which we have to-
day more commercial intercourse than we have
with this Government of Belgium, if I am cor-
rectly informed.
Mr. President, I have no doubt that this prop-
osition will be adopted, and I can see exactly
what will be the result of it; that, if not at this
session, at any rate before this Congress ad-
journs, we shall raise all the grades and the pay
of our ministers and of our foreign consuls.
โข Mr. SUMNER. The Senator from Iowa opens
now a new question. He asks about our interests
in Belgium.
I answer they are, first, commercial; and those
are considerable.
Secondly, they are political; and these are at
this moment if possible more important than any-
thing from commerce. These political interests
have their importance partly from the central po-
sition of Belgium m Europe, being, as I stated
yesterday, on the highway of travel there, so that'
it is a point of observation for our minister, from
which he may take note of what passes over the
whole Continent. But these interests are aug-
mented at this time beyond perhaps their natural
importance by the character of the reigning sov-
ereign. The Senator says that the power is in-
significant, but the intelligence of that sovereign
ib* not insignificant, nor is his influence insignifi-
cant. The Senator knows very well that there is
no sovereign in Europe at this moment who on
personal grounds has so much weight.
Our interests in Belgium are, in the third place,
represented by the fact that we have been in the
