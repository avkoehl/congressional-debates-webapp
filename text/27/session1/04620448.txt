CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
mischievous designs with the Opposition party The Presi 
dent spoke of the peculiarity ofhie position What was its pe
culianty? The President had come into power with a larger
number of votes than any man since the foundation of this Go
Iremment, save the ever to be lamented chief wh ¡>e name stood
at the head of the ticket He had come to Congress and. told
them Tie was prepared to give the Administrate n of that man t
his cordial support he camt backed by a great and a triumph
ant party, with an om whelming majontv but, inspiren bya
mad ambition, that same man, within the shoit space i í twenty
days, with a view to eecme his own re election .detached him
self from his friends and his patty, and thiew himself into the
arms of the Opposition, defied all the obligations under which
the Whigs had come into power in rela ion to the subject of the
currency, tr'flDd with the most eager wishes of the nation,
equivocated or three months, and then—just as the close of the
•ession he asked their compassion and forgiveness He found
no compassion m Mr BJs bosom nor did he think he merited
St from any man who krew what his course had been But
the President said that he had signed all the bills sem to him
for every other object—why should his friends complain be
cause he differed fiom them on thia one pi or, little, trifling,
insignificant question of the currercy? True, he did sign
the other bills—and why* Nothing but the deepest,
the moat unqualified commit al of himself, both m the
Legislature and in his opening address had induced htm to sign
the Land bill  and, if íumor spoke the truth, in legard to that
but he hesitated long The message concluded in the most self
complacentstyle, the Piesident was entirely satisfied with him
self, and confident that he had followed the footsteps of his "god
¡like predecessors" Who the godlike predeíessorswere to
whom he alluded, Mr B was not, peihaps as well advised as
some other gentlemen He knew, indeed, who the two godlike
mea were whom Mr Tyler had referred to when attacking Gen
Jackson for the removal of the deposi'es—he then referred to
Jefferson and Madison [Here Mr B quoted the language re
ferred to, from a speech of Mr Tyler in the Senate 3 Of these,
one (Mr Madison) had been called to act upon a bill for a Na
tional Bank sent him from both Houses of Congress, and had
President Tyler followed the illustrious, the glorious example
of Mr Madison on that occasion?   No, he had lejected it
As to the sty]* of this message, God only knew whether the
President hid written itor not When Mr B read some of he
passages in it he had been ready to suspect that somebody con
nected with the Herald had hid a hand in it Be that as it might,
this tie would say, that, if his own boy of fifteen had written him
a letter with as much tomfoolery in it he should have taken
htm from school, and sent him to the plough
Mr B said he should proceed to examine the course of the
President with mildness, let not gentlemen laugh, as if that was
impossible, Mi B could be mili sometimes General Tacksen
t*ed to siv it was sometimes policy to be rash and violent and
Mr. B did not know but this would be a fit tune for burn a
course, but he should treat the mattei with all moderation and
mildness, forj in truth, he feltverv little exci ement as to this
Bank bill now He had watched its piogress as one fuend
watched the lingering d3ath bed of another, until hisexcitement
had passed away, but his indignation was only increased
Mr B said he would now lay down a proposition whuh
COUld not bedenifd, and that was that the great and all absoib
Sng question which had divided the two great parties m this
country foryears past, was the cunency question This lay at
the foundation of every other Mr B wasnot going to beeo
ridiculous as to say that that was the only isbue made before
the people in all portions of the counti y du ring the late election
The questions discussed were various This of a Bank was
one, but it was not the only one The áub Tieasury was ano
ther, neither was that the onlv one The Distribution bill was
one, but not the only one The Hooe case was one, but it was
not the only fine i he Whigs had not deemed it proper, it was
not good policy, to drive fiom thorn those who were íeady to
join their ranks on othet questions, bee tuse they did not agree
with them about a Bank, but it evinced grobs ignoianre to
affirm that this was not the great and most impoitant of rtll the
questions The Wh g party had then h nt delegates to Ifini* 
burg, and Mi Tyler went there as one AtorfJdentidlluuiUof
liisw the senate [Mr Ri\rs>l had said for Mr B liad heard him
that the nomination at Hamming turne I on the question ot
'Bank orno Bank '' and but foi Mr ( lav's known(ommittal
to a Bank of the United Mates, he would have been nominated,
but th t as Han non wis not so committed, he obtained the
nomination Did the Senator in that remark, express the
sentiment of his friend, the Prtsidmt? Mr B presume 1 he
did And if he did, in what attitude did it place the Preei
dentl Aftei he got to Harnsburg, he lecommended Mr
Clay, and, if rumor again was true he wept and cried over
the result Yes he died to tHnk that the Bank man had
been superseded by the ami bank man ' Now, every body
knew that during ihe interval between Geneial Jackson's vfto
of the Bank bill and the Convention at Harmburg thousand*
and thousands of men had changed then opinion in reiererce
to a Nation 1! Bank from the result* of evpeuence which had
passed under their eyes Mr B admitted in its broadest

by Mr Tylei in relation to a Bank    And what did that same

accusation of peifidy    He could tell gentlemen who happen

this was not the fast time that perfidy and treachery had been
chaiged against thai, gentleman  and proved upon him    In    j
1827, hehal been Gove noi of Virginia   John Randolph was
then a candidate for the Senate    Mr T deprecated all opposi
tion to his election, and declared himself ready to throw him     ,
self into the breach swoid in hand    Yet then, as now, he had
listened to the Opposition party, and by means of their votes
had defeated his friend    Mr B was, to be sure, in a position to
reap the benefit ol the treason, and so could not say much in
the way of complaint, but it had certainly been far from rais
inghis opinion of John Tyler    He had in his hand 1 letter
which exposed the history of the whole transaction    A large
dinner was given to Gen   Floyd and Mr Giles, to which Mr
Tuer had not been invited, and Thomas Ritchie bad  then
spoken of him in the following language [Here Mr B quoted
from the Richmond Enquirer ]
A political change ensued, and before six years were out, Mr
Tyler was an excellent Whig, and, assuch, elected    A similar
charge of treachery had again been prefened against him three
years ago    Mr B had then teen in the Legislature, and had
defended him against the accusation, because he coul 1 not
bring himself to believe that he was guilty    But Mr   Tyler's
recent conduct had veiy much shaken his confidence on   hat
subject    He did not, however, pretend even now to say that
the charge had been well founded    It rested on very similar
ground  to  the  present  case    Mr   Tylei   had been   asked
whether he would accept a nomination from the party op     ,
posed to htm   to which it was sad he hail lephed by ex     1
piessms  his willingness to accept the  nomination of any
patty that would give it to him    The effect had been utterly
to pic* rate him in Virginia insomuch that he could not get
from the people of thtt state the appointment of constable
The confiim non of this wa« founded in the fact, that when, in
the HairisI uig Cenvention, he had been accidentally nomi
nated, (and his nomination was the lesultof accident alone)
not one of thcVirginii delegation there present was willing to
endorse the nomination    They could not go back to the peo
pie of Virginia, and tell them that thiy had supported such a
nan, so they excused themselves on the ground that it would    [
be indelicate to vote lor one of then own colleagues     Indeli     I

I ocoFoco, whoexp edstd a doubt about the matter?   Why
I   was the cry of repeal got up?   That showed thattheie was no
apprehension on the part of the Loco Focos that the bill would
not be signed for they conceited the plan of íaiswjj a repeal

before the middle of July a doubt arose, and just about tha pe

Tyler was a marvellous proper man,   that he was a patnouc,
highminded statesman, anda national benefactor    Mi Ritchie
began to tickle him with ' soft corn,' and Mr Tyler fattened
on it like ahouse pig    And what proposition was then brought
forward ?
[Mr B here quoted an art cíe from the Richmond Enquirer,
in the form of a letter to Mr Tylei, suggesting certain calcula
tionsas to his political prospects ]

Pi esident Tyler accede to if* Mi B msit-ted that from that
hour the whole policy of the Administration was changed
He did notbiy theie had been any bargain and sale Those
who put facts together would draw then own inference What
had since then been the course pursued as to removal ? Mr
B would rettr but to one case A member from Kentucky,
from theLouisvi le district, [\lr Graves ] had openly in the
House pointed to the Reporters' desk of the Globe, and had re
ferred to an individual who, as he said, received a salaiy of
$1 900 as a cleik m one of the Departments, and who never
■ theless, continued to íeport foi the Globe When the Whigs
I came into power, if rumoi spoke the truth, that man was turn
ed out of office, m company with a number of others, ly the
head of the Department They immediately appealed to Pie
& dent Tyler declaring themselves, though hostil   to the pnnci
pies of the Whig paity and the election of General Hainson,
to be good Tyler men What was the consequence? They
were reinstated befoie sundown andifthe individual in quee
tion, being too proud to hold office under such circumstances,
ha 1 since íesigned, it did not affect tie que& ion While this
was going on at Vt a«hington, what was the ca^e m othei parts
of the country? Was any lemonstrance, any admonition from
Whigs heeded at all by President Tylei?
I Now, did any body lalk of John Tyler for the Presidential
succession"1 Yes, and who? Did the Whigs? No Did the
Locofocob? Yes Now, was it credible that that party would
t-ike Tohn Tyler as the r candidate witl>out any change of opi.
¡ nion? They fonneily opposed and ridiculed him There
I muta then have been a change somewhere, but the Locofjcos
had not changed What was the natural inference the plain,
iho obvious, the palpab'e infeicncc? That Mr Tyler had
changed
But tins was no betrayal—no treachery—not at al!    And
why1   Bfcaube it was a difflience of opinion on  only one
j   point     Oi one point11   Why  Arnold  and Hull  differed from
their brother ofhceis only on one point, and that was whether
they should fight for or agair st their country    And was there
any less d fleience here?   1 hi ques ion there was shall I fight
for America or go over to the British    The question here, Mia I
I íemain with the Whig party, or go over to the Locofocos?
Mi  B here, alluding 10 the short lemnant of the hour which
was left him said he must omit much that he had prepared
,   He would say but a word on the one term system, and on that
I   point he would quote a toa&t given ny Mr    lyler m 1837, at a
public dinner m Southampton    [Here Mr B quoted the toast,

Cabinets," and denouncing in the strongest teims, the mi*
