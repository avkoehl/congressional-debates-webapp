Brigadier General GEORGE H. GORDON:

Alexandria, Va.:

Your division will embark on transports for Morris Island, to re-enforce General Gillmore. The commissary and quartermaster's departments will furnish you with all necessary supplies. Your destination will not be made public until you are at sea.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

FORT MONROE, August 7, 1863-11. 30 a. m.

(Received 5. 15 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I have this moment returned from a reconnaissance toward Fort Darling, and your dispatch requiring immediate action to protect the Cherrystone Light-House, telegraph station, &amp;c., has just this moment been received. The cable having been cut, I regret that steps had not been taken before to place the light-houses in this department under guard. I was not aware, owing to my recent arrival here, that they were in such a state. The necessary steps are being taken by General Potter to protect the remaining light-houses, and a force goes over with him to endeavor to catch the marauders.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.

CINCINNATI, OHIO, August 7, 1863.

(Received 12. 55 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

General Scammon represents that a force largely superior to his own is pressing on him. I suppose he calls upon me because I have been in the habit of sending troops when needed in Western Virginia. After the receipt of your dispatch, I shall not assume the responsibility of sending troops out of my department without orders.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, August 7, 1863-11. 45 a. m.

Brigadier-General KELLEY,

West Virginia:

General Burnside telegraphs that General Scammon has applied to him for re-enforcements. What is the necessity of this; and is it made with your authority?

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
