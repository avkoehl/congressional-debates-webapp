probable cause, suppotted by qathm affiimauan, and panicu-
iarly describing the place to be searched, and the persons m
things to be seized ' There was no such distinction aa the
gentleman had di awn, and this whola argument had been set te
rights, as he had before stated, by the gentleman from South
Caioima, (Ml   Legare )
Mi P then lephea to ihe rema s urvauoub&eiitlemcn, with
ic^ud t) the Fxecu 1 t appoinüi g tools «nd minions to inter
fere with the rights. 01 the citizens, «md contended that they had
strangely pervei ted the salutary principles upon which every
Government must act What, he a&ked was the authority pro
pospd to be given to the Executive by this bdii It was nothing
moie not let>s than an authority to direct ceitam United States
officers to pet form tei tain duties, and if they weie insufficient to
peiform them, to appo at others to aid them It was merely
u.11 au'honty to appoint a set of special cons ables, to carry into
effect the laws
Mi ROBERTSON would inquire of the gentleman if theie
was anj clau^em the Constitution which amhomed the Piesi
dent to appoint special constables?
Mi Pa. 1 TON would reply to his colleague, by asking him
it theie was any thmg m the Consitution or laws of Virginia
to authoiizeihosheriffs to appoint baiivffs.and assistants Hebe
heved theie was not yet this power is exerci&ed by eveiy sheriff
evt. 1 y constable, and \y the watchmen of your cities in the
night, foi the pmpose of preserving the peace and ordei of so
ciety Ihis was a power whichmust necessarily be exercised
by all officer  on particular emeigeneies m ordei to carry into
execution the laws which weie enacted by your Legislative
bodies He then íeplied to his col eague, (Mi Wise,) with
íespect to the exception which he had taken íehtive to theai
ie^tot citizens on suspicion This was a thing which m a
Government like Oeus eveiy man was subject to His col
league must know that he was now subject tobeariested upon
lie oath of thegieates >agibond which might ha 1 pen to be
in the land, and all that was in it, was that he w ould have his
lemedy m damage--, if he was wionsf ully arrested
Mi WISE he eagam explained, and beegelto call the at

Mr PATTON thought the gentleman s distinction was adis
Uic ion without a difference Thesemire was made under the
p 1 visions of this bill, by an Executive officei—by an officer of
the law feo that, in both cases, there was an officer of the law
to take cognizance of the matter This whole mattei, he took
