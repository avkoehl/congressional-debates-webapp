blank with the day on which the banks would pro-
bably resume specie payments I believe, sir, said
Mr. R. (turning to Mi Benton,) I am not mista-
ken. [Mr Benton Bigut, rif,ht ] Then, Mi
President, here is a positive penplty denounced
against the banks when they shall return to pecie
payments As the law now stands, the notes of
specie paying banks aie receivible in payment of
the public revenue The Sena'or is willing that
this should continue to be the hw whi e the banks
do not pay specie (or their notes , but v*hen they do
pay specie, the honorable gentleman says to them,
We «ill revoke this privilege, theneefouvard >eject
your notes, though immediately cemveitibl into
specie, and declare tint, fr">m and after the day of
youi if sumption, nothing but gold an 1 sih er shall
be received m discharge of the public dues is
not this, m effect, a direct penalty vi-atcd upon the
banks for returning to specie payments t Under
such a policy, tins gre ' object of public interest
and anxiety n<wer can be accompVhid, and I re-
cur with confide' ce to my c nginai position, that
the only mean* by which it can be effected is a
just, safe, and pttn al policy en tie part of the
Government, announcing to the banks, thai, on
such conditions as may be necessary to guard
against the recuirenct of the catastrophe, we are
now suffering from, we will recen e vour notes,
convertible mío s¡ ecie, m payn ent ot the public
dues, as they have been recened, by the practice
the Treasury Depattment 01 by express tnac'nient
of law, from the ongin of the Goveinmen' down to
the present time
I have thus far, Mr President, spoken rf this
matter mrefeience to the particulai cireumstmcos
of the crisis, and v hat appears to me to lie the press-
ing pnd paramount object to which the altenhun
of every patnolic lepislator ouiht to be direct  d at
the present moment—an earl) lesumptionol cpccic
payments by the banks But, looking at it m a
broader and more general point of \ tew, I ask, sir
upon what principle of lepublican Government is
it that the Governmcn* can be justifn I m drawing
aline between itself and the pemili — in sijmg
there shall be one cunency for the Gov ei nmeni and
its officer:,, and another (or the picat body rf the
community—that the better cm i ency shall le for
the governors, and the baser cmreney foi the go-
verned i Such I have shown must be the effect ol
demanding the public dues in gold anl Silver ex-
clusnely, while the great miss of the c icul ition
shall consist of bank paper Sir, I Iwe a'ways
been taught to believe—my honorable collogue
and myself learned it fiom the bill of rights of
our own State, as soon as we «ere oapab'i ol lead-
ing—that a common in tei est between the got emirs
and the governed is a fundamental prin'iple of
free institutions, and that the best means of",e-
strainwg the former fiom oppression is to make
them feel and participate the hmdens of the latter "
Let the Government share the «ame fate with the
citizen, and vou give it the strongest of all motives
to watch over the general mtetesls On the other
hand, place it in a position different from that of
the great body of the communtt}, especially in so
vital a matter as that of its retinue and pecuniary
support, and you make it, at once, callous and in-
different to the sufferings of the people, and even
give it an interest to perpetuate those suflei ngs
You destroy all sympathy on the part of tin Go-
vernment with the people, mil you -liena i the
confidence and afieciions of the people from the
Government
What, sir, is at this moment the ungiacious atti-
tude in which the Government is placed owards
the people? Its officers and contrictois are p id in
gold and siher, or m Trepsun dnfts made re-
ceivable in discharge of public dues, and theieforc
nearly equivalent to cold anl silver, w'n ° the
community at large aie left to cond ict their busi-
ness, as the}' mav m an mede mable papei cm-
reney. Does not this operate as a virtual me ease
of the salaries of public oflrers, it the must of
general distress affect ng all the rest of the commu-
nity 1 The gold and s ¡ver w hioh tn y receive is at
a premium often or incite per cent, and the Trea-
sury drafts at seven or eight per cut above the
actual and common currency oí the countiy. This
premium is, I repeat, an addition of s0 much to
I the amount of their salaries, for, in a practical
sense, theie has, as yet, been no depiec atton in the
value of current bank no'es They pass for as
much in the ordinary business of life—in the pay-
ment of debts, m the puiuiase of necessaries and
conveniences of whatever is worn, drank, or eaten—
as thtj ever did The premium, then, which the
p lbl c officers and con'ractois ob'am en their gofd
and silvei, and Treasury drafts, is so much clear
g m to them And at whose expense is it acquired'
I it not at that of the great hotly of the people, the
ul'imate lax-pavers and supporters ofthe Govern-
ment' Does any one suppose that the impoi ting
mei'haut, who has to give ten or twelve per cent
fi r the go'd ?nd silver, and seven or eight per cent
for the Tieisnrv drafts, witn which he pays his
duf>es to the Government, does not add an equal
amount, with tie usual profit upon it, to the price
ot his goods? It is, then, the consumer at last, or,
in other woid", the great body oi the people, who
are subject to mireascd taxation for the benefit of
the offlce-ho'der and the contractor
Sir, tins is a slate of things which I do not wish to
see perpetuated It is contrary to the genius and
fundamental principles of our republican system
Of all schemes of policy I can conceive, that which
proposes a peimanent distinction between the Go-
vernment and the people in their pecumaiy inte-
rests—one ennency, and that the betlei one, for the
Government, and anotner, and inferior currency,
for the people—such a system of discrimination is,
to mv mind, ol all others, the mo«t injurious and
revolting in pnnc.ple, the most heartless in charac-
ter, ami the most despotic m its tendencies It is
like quartering the Governments a foieign enemy,
on the heart of the country You entiench it b-hincl
a frowning fortification, surround it with battle-
ments, and lay the countiy, <ar and near, under
contribution for the support of this gainson of
ofiice-holders Desolation ai.d oppression are with-
out, while the tenants of the citulel arc revelling m
luxury and profusion within I am not willing,
for i'iic, to see the Government of my country
placed in this a iti social, it not bclh„eiant, attitude
tnvaids the people I am not wiling that this
iavojed land, to which the nations of the earth are
looking for a succecsful example of the practical
enjeiyment of free institutions, should exhibit such a
spectacle of inequality andoppic ¡> on mthe ey esof
the wnr]d
ATm'i ¡"-'¡ance, Mr. Tre,ident, has been placed
on the popular catch-word of divorcmg the Govern-
ment from all connection with banks Nothing is
more delusive and treacherous than catch-words
flow often has the reveitel n0me of libmly been
invoked, in every quarter of the globe, and every
age of the woild, to disguise and sanctify the most
heaitiess despotisms Let us beware that m at-
tempting to divoice the Government from all con-
nection with banks, we no not end|with divorcing
the Goumirtieiif from the people As long as the
people shall be satisfied in their tiansactions with
each othei, with a sound convertible paper medium,
with a due proportion of the piecious metals form-
ing the basis of that medium, and mingled m the
cmrent of circulation, why should the Government
reject altogether tto cunency oi the people, in the
onerations of the public Treasuiy i II this cur-
rency be good enough foi the masters, it ought to
be so foi the servants. If the Government sternly
reject, for its uses, the general medium of exchange
adtipted by the community, is it not thereby iso'aled
from the general wants and business of the coun-
try, in relation to this gieat concern of the cut-
rency t Do you not give it a separate, if riot hos-
tile, inleicst, and thus, m effect, produce a divorce
MTWFEN GoVTRnMEM  ANDei-OPIE?---3.   T( Suit,   of
all others, to be   nost  deprecated in a republican
system
We have been told, Mi President, of the em-
baí iassments and mconvemcncis to which the Govern-
ment is exposed, by leceivmg its revenues m any
thing but goll and sil er, m sich. an event as has
now overtaken the country anc involved it m
general dis ress For one, *u, I cannot respond
to this appeal I do not desire to see the Govern-
ment placed in a pos.tion that would exempt it
from embarrassment when the people are embar-
rassed.    Would it give any satisfaction to a patri-
otic mind, in the piesent calamitous condition of
'tie country, to see treasures of gold and silver
pounng into the coffers of the Government, while
the people are sufiermg all the evils of an irredeem-
able and depreciating papei currency 1 For myself,
I am free to say, that neither as a citizen nor as a
representatn e, having it m my power, if I would,
to participate, in some degiee, m these peculiar
advantages of the Government, could such a state
of things minister the slightest gratification to me.
No, sir, mv heart disowns the thought So far
from it, the contrast would be but a new feature
added to xhe mollifying and distressed condition of
the country, and casting repioach upon our insti-
tutions which admitted such an unnatural and
antt ícpublican inequality. If any thing could
make youi Government a callous and indifferent
spectator of the sufferings of the people, íefusing
a helping hand to their relief, and " mocking when
their fear cometh," it would be to place it in a
position like this. No, sir, whenever the people
suffei embarrassment, embarrassment should be
felt by the Gov ernment, that it may be stimulated,
through experience of the common suffeung, to do
all it can to prevent or leheve that suffering. I am
for holding the Government in all things to a com
monfate ui'h the people, so that whatever touches
the one shall be immediately felt by the other.
Let the condition of the Government answer to the
condition of the people, so that the coneluct and
policy of the one may, with equal fidelity, reflect
the interests and sentiments of the other.
This, sir, is the principle which has always
guided my views in regard to the great question of
the currency No one desires a sound reform of
the currency more than I do, but I wish to improve
it for the benefit of the people a  well as of the Go-
vernment I desire to see a large infusion of the
precious metals into the general cuculation and
business of the countiy, and not a monopoly of
them by the Goveinment. This great object can
be effected only by the suppression of bank notes
ol the lower denominations, and not by demanding
gold and silver alone in payment of dues to the
Goveinment Let all notes under twenty dollars
be gradually suppressed, and you will have an
abundance of gold and silver in common circula-
tion, passing fiom hand to hand m the common
business of society That will be a salutary and
beneficent reform, enuring to the advantage of
the great bodv of the people, as well as of the Go-
vernment, and when it shall have been accom-
plished, when gold and silver shall thus have
become the common currency of the country, y ou
may, without hardship or injustice, demand pay-
ment of the public dues in the precious metals. But
this most desirable result, the general circulation of
cold and silver in the common business of life,
never can be effected, (as I think I have fully
shown on another occasion,) without a previous
suppression of bank notes of the lowei denomina-
tions. In every scheme of reforming the currency,
which looks to the benefit of the people as wall as
of the Government, this is the great point to be
aimed at It w as the leading object of the measure
I brought forvvaul during the last session of Con-
giess, and which then íeceived the almost unani-
mous sanction of this house, and the assent of a
large majority of the other, though, from causes to
wh ch I have already alluded, it failed to become
a law. The same measure, in all its es-ential prin-
ciples, I now again submit for the consideration of
the Senate
Tne President, sir, m his message, tells us that
the requisition of gold and silver in payment of the
public dues would have " a direct tendency to pro-
duce a wider circulation of the piecous metals, to
increase the safetv of bank paper, and to improve
the general currency " I desire to treat the opin-
ions of the President with all possible respect—a
respect felt alike for the individual and the magis-
trate , but unless I have wholly misconceived the
elementary principles which belong to this subject,
as well as their obvious practical operation, it is
impossible to sustain any one of these positions.
How, sir, can the collection of the revenue in gold
and silvei tend " te w iden the circulation of the
precious metals,'" It is a well known and inv aria-
ble law of currency, that bank notes and coins
