at the eastern foot of the Alleghany mountains
and upon the left bank of the Potomac, as
the starting-pom . They say in their report
that it would be an insult to the. intelligence of
Congress to enlarge upon the highly important
considerations of cementing the union of our
citizens located on the western waters with
those of the Atlantic States. They then add
this eminently broad and patriotic view of the
question. They say:
"Politicians have generally agreed that rivers
unite the interests and promote the friendship of
those who inhabit their banks; while mountains,
on the contrary, tend to the disunion and estrange-
ment of those who are separated by their interven-
tion. In the present case, to make the crooked
ways straight and the rough ways smooth, will, in
effect, remove the intervening mountains, and by
facilitating the intercourse of our western brethren
with those on the Atlantic, substantially unite thom
in interest, which the committee believe is the most
effectual cement of union applicable to the human
race."
These, sir, are words of a philosopher and
statesman. I pause a moment to dwell on
them. They were penned when the treason
of Aaron Burr was the subject of general dis-
cussion ; when it was supposed the ties were
weakened which bound the western country
to the Atlantic States. The committee dwell
upon the importance of cementing—that is
the word they use—cementing the union of
the people who dwelt on the eastern and west-
ern slopes of the mountains. Powerfully do
they argue that to unite them in interest by
facilitating their intercourse with each other
would be the most effectual cement of union.
And the building of this road was to be the
meansof removing the mountain barrier which
separated them.
Why do I cite this report and dwell upon its
language? It is to prove that this was a na-
tional highway, demanded by the highest con-
siderations of statesmanship, and should have
been built at the public expense. It is to show
that Congress should do now what ought to
have been done then, regard aiid treat this
road as one in which the whole nation was
interested as a measure of peace and union,
and not seek to charge its expense upon the
young communities of the West.
I have before me various references to the
debates which occurred upon the bill the com-
mittee introduced, but dare not consume the
time ofthe Senate by referring to them. The
bill regulated the laying out and making a road
from Cumberland, in the State of Maryland,
to the State of Ohio. It passed the Senate
on the 27th of December, 1805. In the House
it encountered opposition. Mr. Clark and
Mr. Jackson thought there should be three
roads, and the latter opposed the route selected.
Mr. Morrow, of Ohio, believed the road fixed
by the committee would be conducive to the
interests of the western people ; that it was
the best and most direct route.
The bill became a law on the 29th March,
1806, and will be found in the Statutes-at-
Large, volume one, page 357. It would con-
sume too much time to state its details. The
road was to be tour rods in width, and to be
raised in the middle of the carriage way with
stone and earth, or gravel and sand, or a
combination of some or all of them, leaving a
ditch or water-coinse on each side. The sum
of $30,000 was appropriated, payable from the
two per cent, fund of Ohio.
The next appropriation made was of the sum
$50f000, on March 3, 1811, (2 Statutes, 061.)
The next of $30,000, on May 6, 1812. Then
followed appropriations in the following order:
February 14, 1815, (volume three, page 20G.)
of $100,000; April 14, 1818, (volume three,
page 426,) of $52,984 60; April 14, 1818, by
the same act a further appropriation of
$260,000. Up to this date the appropriations
aggregate $422,984 60, and with the exception
ofthe last and largest one, it is declared that
though the moneys are appropriated from the
Treasury, they are to be reimbursed from the
fund provided in Ohio's enabling act.
The act of May, 18, 1820, (volume three,
page 604) directs the President to appoint
three commissioners to examine the country
between Wheeling and a point on the left,
bank of the Mississippi river to be selected by
them, between St. Lotus and the mouth of the
Illinois river, and to lay out the road eighty
feet in width between the two points.
Then follows this proviso :
" Provided, And it ishercby enacted and declared,
that nothing in this act contained, or that sliall be
dono in pursuance thereof, shall bo deemed or con-
strued to imply any obligation on the part of the
United States to make ordetrny the expense of mak-
ing the road hereby authorised to be laid out, or any
part thereof."
One hundred thousand dollars was appro-
priated to defray the expenses of laying out
the road, but nothing was said about its reim-
bursement.
This declaration of Congress appears the
more remarkable when we remember that at
this time all three of the States, Ohio, Indi-
ana, and Illinois, had been admitted into the
Union under enabling acts which bound the
United States to make the road. But here is
a distinct disclaimer ofthe obligation, looking
very much like repudiation, although up to
this time all the money expended would not
amount to the five per cent, fund yielded by
Ohio for the sake of the road.
The next act of Congress 1 find on the sub-
ject istliat of March 3,1825, (volume four, page
128.) It appropriates $150,000 for opening
and making a road from the right bank ot the
Ohio, opposite Wheeling, to tho Muskingum
river. The fourth section directs the President
to appoint a commissioner, who was to prose-
cute the examination and surveys before com-
menced, and to extend the same to tho seat, of
government of the State ot Missouri, passing
through the capitals of Ohio, Indiana, and
Illinois. At this time Missouri had been ad-
mitted as a State into the Union, with the same
stipulation as to building a road in its enabling
act. On March 2,1827, (volume four, page 228,)
$30,000 was appropriated to repair the road
between Cumberland and Wheeling. On March
2, 1829, (volume four, page 351,) there was
appropriated $100,000 to make the road west
ot Zanesville.
On the same day another act was passed
for opening tho road located through Indiana.
It was to be a turnpike road, and the work was
to commence at Indianapolis and be prose-
cuted to the eastern and western boundaries
of the State. The sum of $50,000 was appro-
priated for the purpose.
On the next day, March 3,1829, (volume four,
page 363,) $100,000 was granted to repair the
bridges, walls, and other works on the road
east of Wheeling.
On March 2, 1831, (volume four, page 4G9,)
several appropriations were made: one ot
$100,000 for making the road west of Zanesville;
$950 on account of repairs made in 1830; $2,700
in completing payments to individuals for work
done east of Zanesville ; $265,000 for payment
of arrearages for the survey ot the road from
Zanesville to the capital of Missouri; $75,000
for grading and bridging the road in Indiana
and for work done east and west of Indian-
apolis; and $66,000 was appropriated for open-
ing, grading, and bridging the road m Illinois.
Again, on24thJuue, 1834, (volutnefour, page
680,) I find that $200,000 was appropriated to
continue the road in Ohio, §150,000 in Indi-
ana, and $100,000 in Illinois. At the same
time $300,000 was appropriated for the road
east of the Ohio river, in order to carry out
the compact, made with Maryland, Virginia,
and Pennsylvania, to which States the road
had then been surrendered. In this connec-
tion I quote the language of the last law rel-
ative to this appropriation:
"That as soon as the sum by this act, appropriated,
or so much thereof as is necessary, shall be expended
in the repair of said road, agreeably to the provis-
ions of this act, tho snuie shall be surrendered to
the Slates respectively through which said road
passes, andthe United Stat.es shall not therealter^bo
subjected to any expense lor impairing said ro.vi.
From this time forwaidttie Cumberland road
east of the Ohio river ceases to figure in our
legislation. The mountains have been scaled,
the road not only built, but repaired, is now
handed over to these old States to be converted
by them into toll-roads, with gates at every
twenty miles, where tribute is to be paid for its
use by the citizens of the West, whose money
has built it.
I come now to the next act on the subject,
that, of March 3, 1835, (volume four, page 772,)
by winch $200,000 is appropriated to continue
the road in Ohio, and $100,000 to contiuue it
in Indiana.
I spoke too soon, sir, a moment ago when I
said we should hear no more of the Cumber-
land road east.of Wheeling, for here I find that
$340,186 58 is appropriated to carry into effect
the arrangements with these old Slates and to
put the road into perfect condition to be handed
over to them as a giacious gift. Again Con-
gress says that when this money is expended
the United States are to be at no further
expense about the road.
The next act is that of July 2,1836, (volume
five, page 71.) By this $200,000 is appropri-
ated to continue the road in Ohio, $250,000
to continue it in Indiana, and $150,000 to cou
tinue it in Illinois. There is a cautious pro-
viso that the appropriation for Illinois should
be limited to grading and bridging the road,
and it was not to be construed as pledg-
ing Congress to future appropriations for mac-
adamizing it. By the second section_ the
moneys appropriated lor Ohio and Indiana
were directed to be expended in completing
the greatest possible continuous portions of
the road in those States, so that the iinished
parts might be surrendered to them.
Again, 011 March 3, 1837, (volume five, page
195,) appropriations were made ; $190,000 to
continue the road in Ohio, $100,000 to con-
tinue it in Indiana, aud $100,000 to continue
it in Illinois.
And now, Mr. President, I come to the last
act making appropriations to this work. It was
passed May 25, 1838, (volume five, page 228,)
and to continue it in Obio $150,000 vyas appro-
priated ; to continue it in Indiana, $150,000 ;
and to continue it in Illinois, $150,000 ; and to
complete a bridge over Dunlap's creek, in
Pennsylvania, $9,000. I should add that the
year previous $7,100 was appropriated for the
repair of the road east of the Ohio river.
More than eleven years afterthis, on August
11,1848, (volume six, page 283,) Congress, by
an act of that date, transferred to Indiana allot'
the road within its limits. No memorial from
the State is referred to. None, to my knowl-
edge, was made. A similar act was passed as
t.o Illinois, May 9, 1856, without request from
the State. With this cession the Cumberland
road disappears from our national legislation.
Mr. President, weardy and step by step I
have gone over the statutes during a period of
more than forty years of our national liie, to
bring to the notice of the Senate all that has
been done by Congress on this subject; and
now my task is nearly ended. Though I did
not stop to note the fact m making these cita-
tions, it is still quite true that m most of
these acts ot Congress subsequent to 1820 it
is expressly provided that the United States
shall be reimbursed from the two per cent,
fund accruing to these States under their
enabling acts.
I avail myself of the labors of Mr. Morris,
of Illinois, who has given this subject a great
deal of attention, and whose pamphlet is an
exhaustive argument, to say that in building
the Cumberland road $2,812,034 21 was ex-
pended in the States of Maryland, Pennsyl-
vania, and Virginia; that the average expend-
iture on the road per mile in these States was
$21,303, while in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois
the average expenditure per mile was only
$7,637. Those who oppose this bill seek to
charge up against these new States whose
money built the road all these expenditures.
The road to the Mississippi river, which
