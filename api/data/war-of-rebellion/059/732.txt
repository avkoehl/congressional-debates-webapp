DEMOPOLIS, April 2, 1864.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Dalton:

My scouts report from Oxford, 25th, Sherman's horses preparing to move; can't learn where. Hurlbut and staff went up river Saturday. Rumored Sixteenth and Seventeenth Army Corps ordered to Army of Potomac; four regiments infantry at Decatur fortifying; Dodge's division at Athens; Logan's at Huntsville; enemy's cavalry raiding out from Decatur. Very much in want of Roddey's force in that region. Secret-service man from Cincinnati says troops furloughed in Western army ordered, after expiration of furlough, to report to the Army of the Potomac; expedition, composed of Banks' and Sherman's troops, which went up Red River not yet returned. General Maury reports twenty-five vessels belonging to Navy and ten transports at Pensacola. Few troops at New Orleans, Baton Rouge, or Port Hudson. Dispatch from Forrest reports capture of Union City with 450 prisoners, 200 horses, and 500 small-arms; captured Paducah, held it ten hours, discovered it infested with small-pox and left, taking with him 50 prisoners, many stores and horses, burned dry-dock, &amp; c. Colonel Thompson, Third Kentucky, killed; lost in all about 25 killed and wounded; enemy's loss, killed and wounded, in Paducah, 55.

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.
