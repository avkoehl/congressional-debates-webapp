The 10-inch columbiad with broken trunnion was removed from Sumter last night and brought to the city. Carriages and chassis were sent to Fort Sumter for a 42-pounder and 10-inch, to be mounted in casemate. They will probably be in position to-night.

To-day the enemy were unusually quiet. Eighty-eight shells were fired at Gregg and Wagner from Battery Simkins and 23 shots from Cheves. Effect unknown.

October 6, 1863.-The enemy are at work on Wagner and Gregg, and are making rapid improvements to those work. The firing to-day was not very heavy on either side. One hundred and nine shots were fired from Simkins and 43 from Cheves, but with what effect is unknown.

Major Elliott reports two submarine affairs near the Ironsides, also several wooden gunboats. The Ironsides appears to have escaped injury from last night's attempt to destroy her.

T-,

General.

October 7, 1863.-There is no material change in the fleet this morning. The monitor seen off the bar on the 5th instant has taken position inside, and the one reported on the same day going south in tow of a steamer has probably been sent to Port Royal for repairs.

The enemy's Morris Island works progress as usual, and they fired to-day only a few shots at Battery Cheves, in response to the fire of that battery, Simkins, and the works on Sullivan's Island. Seventy shots were fired to-day from Simkins and 74 from Cheves.
