25th Cong....3d Sess.
Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
Senate & Ho. of Reps,
Government could not devote them to a general
school,and this the society admits There is no
disposition to discourage the efforts of those who
choose to labor in this work of benevolence. On
the contrary, there is, as there should be, an
eagerness to meet any advance which promises
greater facilities for improving the mind and mor-
als of the Indian Upon success in this depart-
ment hangs every hope All that can be done to
encourage and cheer on those who have devised
this scheme of goodness and charity, I think,
should be done But, whatever reform may be
deemed advisable in the direction and economy of
the separate schools, it appears to me that if the
proposed central school shall be established, they
should be kept up too They may, perhaps, be
more numerous than is necessai y or advantageous,
they may be too expensively conducted, or more
scholars ought to be taught for the money ex-
pended, or they may be badly located, but each,
or all, of these objections may be obviated, and the
schools improved For such minor institutions,
would not the centtal school be able to furnish
teachers ' Could not the Government, in consid-
eration of any pecuniary aid it might render, exact,
as a condition, that a certain number of young
Indians of capacity should yearly leave the central
school, qualified to be instructors, who shall make
compensation for their own education by teachina
as long as might be thought a suitable return '
After such a plan had been in operation three or
four years theie would be an annual supply
The manual-labor system has been advan-
tageously employed in one or two instances, par-
ticularly among the Wyandota of Ohio, and by
bringing it into general use, better success, it is
hoped, may attend the exertionsmakiHg to impart
knowledge to the benighted Indians Their capa-
cities are represented as not inferior, and yet the
different reports made are not very gratifying
There must be some defect in the course adopted,
and, it is thought, it may be found where it has
been stated to exist, whatever else may be deemed
expedient, the connection of manual labor in
various shapes with the benevolent toil of instruc-
tion, recommends itself by the strongest consid-
erations Herewith is communicated a statement
which gives the information, in possession of this
office, respecting the various Indian schools
The general obligations of the Government to
the different tribes, the fulfillment of which is made
through the agency of this office, have been at-
tended to The reports that have been received
from the different superintendents and agents,
show the general condition of their respective
charges. Although here and there your eye rests
on a green spot, the field is generally barren For
those not yet removed, much, if any, ameliora-
tion is not to be expected, for the emigrants, every-
thing will depend upon the line of policy that may
be adopted. If it be adapted to their condition
and wants, and be directed by discretion and wis-
dom in those to whom Us execution may be
committed, the most beneficial results may be an-
ticipated A crisis in their fate has arrived which
cannot but make an epoch in their history. The
ground is untrodden, and for that reason, together
with my own newness of relation to them, the ob-
servations already made,and any others which may
follow, are submitted with diffidence. The powers
and duties of agents, and their permanent assign-
ment to particular tribes, are of long standing.
The judiciousness of the latter, it is thought,
may be well questioned Referí mg not to per-
sonal considerations, which are always danger-
ous ground of legislative or executive regula-
tion, is it expedient to identify the agent with the
tube into which he is sent' Is there not some
hazard of his becoming attached to their particu-
lar interests, to then customs, to leading men
among them, to all that is theirs ' The more
there is in the agent to esteem, the more likely
will it be to happen If there were but one tribe
and one agency, this would be most desirable,
bat the United States, observing their special
treaty obligations to each, intend even-handed jus-
tice and protection and improvement, as they owe
them to all With the feelings that have been
attributed to th ese fixed agencies, will not the in-
dividuals who fill them, become the partisans each
of his own particular charge ' It cannot be other-
wise, and experience must have shown it. In all
differences between tribes, wherever there are con-
flicting interests, or criminations and recrimina-
tions, the several parties will find in their attached
agents willing and zealous advocates However
this may commend the individual, the Govern-
ment seeks information from the calm, who take
no counsel from their feelings. A dispassionate
representation of claims or acts is necessary to
just conclusions, and it is not reasonable to ex-
pect it from devoted friends Such, it is supposed,
long continued residence and intercourse will
make agents It is suggested whether it would
not be better to allow each of them to reside but
a limited time in any one district By transfer-
ring the agents from one position to another,
as frequently as may be regarded proper, they
will be cut off from the strong enlistment of their
feelings, or if, petchanee, it will still occur, a
removal to another agency will produce kindred
predilections elsewhere, and these attachments
will neutralize each other By a general consid-
eration of the interests of all, those of each will
be bettei understood A general association will
liberalize the views, and by widening the horizon,
give a look over the whole surface It might be
well to authorize the yeaily ot semiannual as-
semblage of the agents within particular district*,
to confer upon the conditions of their seveial
trusts it may be said that the influence which
the Government should hold among these lude
beings has been preserved, and can be maintained
only through agents, but cannot this influence be
ours through others, and it it cvi, is it not unwise
to confine it to our own officers alone' With
them it must cease in a ¡state of things whi^h
mi^ht be supposed Besides, the traders are li
censed, if they are as judiciously selected as they
ought to be, might th< y not be useful in this par-
ticular' But the chiefs should be so treated as to
make of them fast frends, and their continued
presence, under any circumstances, among the
Indians, would furnish us advocates when they
would be most needed If, upon full considera-
tion, these suggestions should be adopted, there
does not seem to be (for this particular purpose)
any change of law necessary, for the act of 30th
of June, 1834, providing for the organization of
the department of Indian Affairs, "authorizes
' the President, whenever he may judge it expe-
• dient, to discontinue any Indian agency, or to
' transfer the same from the place or tribe desig-
' nated by law, to such other place or tribe as the
' public service may require " The supenntend-
ency of St Louis is fixed, by the above law, at
that place, it has become an inconvenient location,
and should be removed to Fort Leavenworth, or
some other point west of Si Louis, but this can-
not be done without the interposition of Congress
It is respectfully recommended that the necessary
legislation be requested, leaving the place discre-
tionary with the War Department
The statement of disbursements through this
office exhibits a large amount of expenditure It
shows what has been remitted to diffeient public
agents, foi how much they have sent in accounts,
and what proportion remains unaccounted foi
This, except as to the amount drawn out, gives
no precise information. The disbursements of
the agents can be only settled finally in the ac-
counting offices of the Government, and conse-
quently, the balances unaccounted for may be less
or more, as the sums expended and vouchers pro-
duced may be allowed or not The statement is
made from such information as is on file How-
ever large the amount of the requisitions, they
were made to fulfill treaty obligations, and to effect
objects most desirable to the Government and the
country I also send a general statement, show-
ing the amount applicable to expenditure, and the
amount expended in the service of the depart-
ment of Indian Affairs, during the year ending
30th September last. The condition of the civil-
ization fund is shown by exhibit 36, and of the
treaty funds for education purposes by statement
37, herewith transmitted As thelaw now stands,
all sums that are not used within two years after
they have been appropriated, go into the surplus
fund of the Treasury; and, if they are wanted for
the original objects, must be reappropnated. It
frequently occurs from limitation in treaties, from
their having been ratified conditionally, and a va-
riety of causes, that money appropriated for the
purposes of this office cannot be used within two
years; and a great inconvenience would result,
were it not that a practice has prevailed of draw-
ing out such balances as it is thought will be
wanted, and which would otherwise fall into the
surplus fund The amount so obtained is placed
to the credit of the disbursing agent here, and
applied in discharge of the Government obliga-
tions. This is, although substantially correct,
irregular, and to avoid, for the future, the neces-
sity of such a resort, I think the law ought to be
altered, so as to allow three years for the expend-
iture This, I hope, if a general change is not
thought expedient, may be done in regard of this
office, so that no money, except for contingencies,
and the salaries of the gentlemen employed in the
bureau, shall in future be called for, that is, not
paid at the Treasury, on special requisitions, at
the time and for the precise object that requires the
expenditure
The disease which was so destiuctive of human
life everywhere before the discovery of" the art
of vaccination, has been peculiarly fatal among
the Indians during the past year Their general
want of medical advice, and neglect of precau-
tionary measures, added to their «regular and
exposed modes of living, made them certain vic-
tims to the scourge It appealed among; the
Chickasaws, by whom it was introduced among
the Choctaws in the west, and, from the wander-
ing disposition of the sufferers, it was extended
Numerous deaths occurred, notwithstanding
every exertion was made to confine the diseased,
and prevent their association with the well, but
hy the early and diligent use of vaccine matter
much was done in this quaiter to arrest the rav
ages of the disorder It was, however, in the
northwest that the greatest amount of human lift
was extinguished, among the more savage and
unsettled tribes It is computed that, among th«
Sioux, Mandaos, Riccaras, Minnetarees, Assm.
aboines, and Biackfeet Indians, seventeen thou
sand two hundred persons sunk under the small-
pox In at least one other tribe it is known to
have prevailed, but no attempt has been made to
count the victims, nor is it possible to reckon
them in any of these tribes with accuracy; it is
believed that if the above number was doubled,
the aggregate would not be too large for those
who have fallen east of the Rocky Mountains.
Whether it reached beyond them is unfcno-wii.
But vaccine matter was sent by a gentleman, Who
was traveling to the Columbia river region, with
a request that he would endeavor to introduce it
theie On this side, and where the malady pre-
vailed so extensively every exertion was used to
vaccinate as generally as possible, and a physi-
cian was dispatched for the sole purpose, under
the direction of this office, while the pestilence
was at its height The intrinsic difficulties at-
tending such efforts are apparent, still, it is be-
lieved much prevention was effected and good
done The medical gentleman employed on this
benevolent errand vaccinated about thlee thou-
sand persons
The removals west make a new organization Oi
the superintendences and agencies advisable 1
have already submitted some observations in
favor of their mutual tiansfer, and if they remain
as the law of 1834 arranged them, the executive
power, as heretofore remarked, is, perhaps, suffi-
cient for the purpose If, however, the change
alluded to should take place, it would be proper
to reenact the authority, with specific legal pro-
visions as to compensation and the bonds for per-
formance of duty Some regulation as to the
disbursing agents will also be expedient By the
law of the 5th July last, officers in the line of the
Army cannot be employed on this duty after the
5th July next Officeis of the staff may, it is
presumed, render this service, none would do it
more efficiently or faithfully The only objection
to them is that military exigencies might call them
away
There is one measure that, in my judgment, is
of great importance; it has heretofore1 attracted the
