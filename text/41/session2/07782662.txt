THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 13,
reference to it by one or more members, one of whom,
the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means,
denominated it a bugbear, and another honorable
member, Mr. Ivellby, stigmatized it as fraud-
ulent.
My object now is to state to you, and to request
that you will seize the first opportunity to declare to
the House;
That the statement was made from entries, the
orit'inals of whioh are deposited in the custom-house
at New York, with two exceptions only, and those
exceptions refer to goods excluded by the enormous
duty. That wo are prepared to furnish the date of
entries, the ship by which the eioods came, the
mai Ies and numbers of the packages, and the amount
of duty paid on each ; and to show by the officials of
the custom-houso that the statement is correct iu
every pariiculiir. i desiro, also, to have stated that
nine tenths of all the articles in the statement were
imported by us for our own account, in the legitimate
conduct of our business, and that it was not made
for deception but from entries and invoices as they
came. That our motive was to show fairly and hon-
estly the practical operation of the existing tariff
from the combined system of specific and ad valorem
duties so skillfully designed and artfully contrived
to prevent even exports from knowing its practical
effoet without tho goods in hand.
jUay I ask you thus to favor my firm so as to con-
tradict the slanderous allegations which have been
or may be made in referenco to it.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, yours,
B. 11. IiUTION.
Firm of Bod ord & Iluflon, New York.
lion. S. S. Cox, House of Ilepresentativcs.
Mr. SCHENCK. Now we have the word
of an importer. When the statement was first
made in connection with the particular para-
graph of tho bill then under consideration I
confronted it with the Treasury returns and
showed that it was not a true but a false state-
ment. Since this gentleman has volunteered
to say that the remarks I then made are slan-
derous, I desire distinctly to repeat what I said
in reference to the particular paragraph em-
bracing certain woolen goods, that as regards
the average duties upon them the returns of
the Treasury Department show that what was
claimed, as I understood, in the paper referred
to by the gentleman from New York—that they
were higher than, 1 think, 67 cents—was not
true. That, is all I have to say about it.
Mr. COX. I beg to say in reply to the gentle-
man from Ohio that I will find out the authentic
records, and before we are done with the tariff
that I will have the custom-house books and
collector's certificates to show that the gentle-
man from Ohio when he says that these are
not correct statements is himself mistaken, to
use the tenderest expression ; and that when
he fixes upon these people the stigma of slan-
derers he is guilty of injustice to honorable
men of high character who have been in the
business for half a century.
Mr. SCHENCK. I care not who or what
they are. They are interested in the matter;
I am not. I know nothing about the matters
to which they refer; but I will say that the
returns of the Treasury Department are made
up from these very custom-house documents;
and the returns from the Treasury Department
show what the percentage of duty was, as I
stated in the debate the other day.
Mr. COX. I would ask the gentleman how
can we find outabout these matters except from
men that are interested? When the gentleman
is arranging the duties on iron does he not hear
those who are interested in iron? The com-
mittee in coming to a decision as to any par-
ticular article hear everybody who is interested
in that article, as a general rule. It is only
the importers that they will not hear.
Mr. SCHENCK. I desire to know what is
the amendment before the committee?
The CHAIRMAN. The amendment of the
gentleman from New York, [Mr. Cox,] to
strike out "GO" and insert "40."
Mr. COX. [ withdraw the amendment.
Mr. SCHENCK. I may remark that this
paragraph in the bill is simply a repetition of
the present law, which makes the duty 60 per
cent, ad valorem.
Mr. IIOLMAN. I move to amend by strik-
ing out the word "sixty," and inserting in lieu
thereof the word "eighty-five." Mr. Chair-
man, the argument iu favor of the increase of
duty which I propose on these silk fabrics is
that they are an article which certainly can
afford to bear a very fair duty, at least up to
the average of the duty imposed on importa-
tions generally. And if it was proper to impose
on articles like flannels, blankets, knit goods,
and other articles of that class so high a duty
as 85 per cent.—so high a duty, I should say, as
a minimum of 85 per cent.—I do not see why
the same duty should not be imposed on silks.
The class of persons who use the latter class
of articles, manufactures of silk, are certainly
as able to pay a large portion of the tax for the
support of this Government as the class of
persons who are especially interested, as pur-
chasers, in woolen goods.
I presume that the only argument which can
be suggested against making the duty on silks
as high as the duty on woolen goods is that in
the one case there are greater facilities for
smuggling than in the other. I suppose that
that is the only argument. But I think, in
regard to articles of this class, that it is not
proper to predicate legislation on the idea that
the laws will be evaded and that the revenue
will be defrauded through the smuggling in
of these goods.
As the Representative of a constituency
greatly interested in the one class, woolen
goods, and not so much in the other class,
silk goods, 1 am not willing that 1 should be
considered by my silence to acquiesce in the
discrimination that is made, by imposing a
minimum of 85 per cent, on the very lowest
article of woolen goods imported, while silk
goods are imported at GO percent.; a discrim-
ination of 25 per cent, in favor of goods used
by the class of persons the best able to pay a
tax to the Government.
Mr. MAYNAliD. I think there is some
force in the view of the gentleman from Indi-
ana, [Mr. Holman,] and if he will modify his
amendment a little I will support it. If instead
of making it 85 he will say 65 per cent. I will
give him my support, whatever it may be worth.
This paragraph, it will be observed, embraces
"all manufactures of silk not otherwise pro-
vided for." I think it is desirable, as.far as
possible in adjusting the tariff, to have a specific
rate upon all qualities of goods. Wherever
there is a general clause of this kind, embracing
articles not otherwise specified, the rate of duty
on which is lower than on the specific articles,
the tendency is, by change of name or change
of style in one way or in another, to throw a
large number of articles into the non-enumer-
ated class at a lower rate. The tendency is in
that direction. I think the articles mentioned
in these paragraphs, intended to embrace arti-
cles that are not capable of being specifically
classified, should bear a little higher rate of duty
than those which are specifically named, for the
purpose of protecting the revenue and prevent-
ing frauds. If the gentleman will say 05 per
cent, instead of 85 per cent. I will cheerfully
support his amendment.
Mr. IIOLMAN. The gentleman can move
to amend the amendment.
Mr. MAYNAliD. I did not rise to move to
amend the amendment, but to oppose it.
Mr. SCHENCK. I move to amend the
paragraph by striking out " 60 per cent." and
inserting "61 percent." My object is, as I
have now the figures in my hand, to recur to
the remarks of the gentleman from New York,
[Mr. Cox.] We had a discussion the other
day in reference to a particular paragraph in
the bill, that in relation to "dress woolen goods
for women and children ;" and again this paper,
got up by some free-trade importers in New
York, was brought forward and was the sub-
ject of comment. Among other things, we
were told of the " enormous percentages" on
those goods. I produced the Treasury report,
which I now hold in my hand, made up from
the returns in the custom-house, and showed,
in reference to every single item provided for
in that paragraph, that the range was from 50^
per cent, to 68J per cent,
showing that fact now:
