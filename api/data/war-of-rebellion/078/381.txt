Hernando I learned that Bly was at Coldwater crossing. I also learned that there was no bridge across the Coldwater, but a ferry- boat. The place is reported to be strongly picketed. There are also patrols on the Holly Ford, Hernando, and Horn Lake road. Deeming it advisable, I fell back to Nonconnah for further orders.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SPEARMAN,

Major, Commanding Expedition.

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

My report is done, and will be forwarded as soon as I get a few more of the subordinate reports. I am awaiting a courier from General Grant. All well, and troops in fine, healthy camps, and supplies coming forward finely. Governor Brown had disbanded his militia, to gather the corn and sorghum of the State. I have reason to believe that he and Stephens want to visit me, and I have sent them a hearty invitation. I will exchange 2,000 prisoners with hood, but no move.

Governor BROUGH,

Columbus, Ohio:

Don't send commissioners for sick, pay, or anything else to this army. If our road has to carry citizens I cannot feed and care for my army. I will let commissioners for the vote come, and none others. Your own colonels and surgeons can take care of the wounded and sick. This rule is imperative and universal.

Major Thomas T. ECKERT,

Washington:

No news from Atlanta. Nothing going on, except exodus of the people. Rousseau returned here last night. Roddey reported to have crossed Tennessee, via mouth of Flint Rive, r 1,000 strong. No damage yet. That part of Wheeler's force which turned back from near Murfreesborough crossed Clinch River near Clinton, moving toward Blain's Cross-Roads. Generals Gillem and Tillson after them.
