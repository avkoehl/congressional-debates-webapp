your position with the fewest possible number of men, and report at once what number of men you will have disposable for an attack upon Hancock's right. General Sedgwick has the same instructions. You will confer with him respecting the line you are both to hold.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

MAY 6, 1864.

(Received 11.10 a.m.)

Colonel LOCKE:

Enemy's infantry moving at double-quick to our left or toward General Hancock. Can see them in field occupied by General Crawford yesterday.

CASLTE.

MAY 6, 1864-11 a.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I will go at once in person to consult with General Sedgwick, and have ordered up my tools. I will the regular engineer officers take charge of the line, if you have no objection. I will then have available, comparatively fresh, two brigade of Pennsylvania Reserves, say about 2,200; two brigades of General Robinson, 2,000; two brigades of General Griffin, 2,000; engineer troops, 1,500; total 7,700. Perhaps the remainder, heavy artillery and Wadsworth's division, will hold my line intrenched.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 6, 1864-12 m.

Major-General WARREN:

General Hancock is very heavily pressed and has had to retire. It may perhaps be necessary either to make and advance from your left, or send troops to him from your command. Have some in readiness. Has Colonel Morrison reported to you with the three regiments of Burnside?

GEO. G. MEADE.

MAY 6, 1864-12.45 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

An aide of General Wadsworth has just come in. He reports that the general is killed; that he was with him when he was struck in the head about half an hour ago. The body was left on the ground. The troops he had with him are forming on the plank road. The Second Corps and Getty's division are falling back to the plank road. The aide who brings this is Lieutenant Rogers.

Very respectfully,E. R. PLATT,

Major, &amp;c.
