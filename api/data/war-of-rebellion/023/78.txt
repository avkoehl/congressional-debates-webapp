Major-General BUELL:

All the engines on this road are broken down and worthless.

There are 400 convalescents belonging to the advance divisions of your army now at Corinth awaiting transportation. Please have some of the engines at Decatur crossed and put on this road that I may be enabled to forward your supplies and the soldiers, who are very uncomfortable at Corinth.

It will be impossible to forward anything unless I get some of the engines from Decatur.

Please answer, that I may know what to report to General Halleck in regard to the engines.
