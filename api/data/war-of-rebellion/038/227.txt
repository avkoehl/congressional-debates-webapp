MILLIKEN'S BEND, April 23, 1863.

M. C. MEIGS, Quartermaster-GENERAL:

A large number of boats have been discharged or sent up the river since I have been here, and General Grant has directed the stores, except those which are perishable, and ordnance stores, to be landed, and all boats here to be discharged, except sufficient for the close transportation of 10,000 troops and four batteries of artillery for short trips. The now-boats are not kept there. Barges are kept, because they are needed, and it is supposed they can be built at less cost than it would take to send them back. When no longer required, they will be sent to Memphis for sale, or such disposition as may be judged best for the interest of the service. The water is falling quite rapidly. I shall to-morrow take a

tow-boat through the canal and bayou to Richmond, and then down to Carthage. Colonel Reynolds has been relieved from duty here as chief quartermaster, by General Grant, and I have ordered him to report in person to you.

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

HEADQUARTERS Fifteenth ARMY CORPS, Camp before Vicksburg, April 23, 1863.

Major General JAMES B. McPHERSON:

DEAR GENERAL: I am ordered to move on the road to Carthage next in order to you. I would be much obliged if you would give me a little notice in advance of the time. The road will be clear. I now have one DIVISION (Tuttle's) on the other side of the new canal, whence they can march to Milliken's Bend. The other two DIVISIONS (Blair's and Steele's) will have to be ferried up to the Bend. As our details of march and service should be as uniform as possible, I would be obliged if you would send me your orders prescribing the order of march of your DIVISIONS and trains.

With sincere respect,&amp;c.,

W. T. SHERMAN.
