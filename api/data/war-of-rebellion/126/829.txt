that all such persons so failing to report, but whose names may be communicated through other sources to the Board of Enrollment, shall, if drafted and accepted, be compelled to serve personally. Let the foregoing rule apply to aliens, to persons having conscientious scruples against bearing arms, and to all classes and descriptions of persons, without distinction, whose ages are within the prescribed limits.

In like manner let it be made the duty of all persons coming into a district for the purpose of residence, or removing from a district with intention to reside elsewhere, to report as aforesaid to the proper officers for enrollment, and make it the duty of each district provost-marshal to furnish the provost- marshal of the district from which such new residents have removed with a certificate that they have been duly enrolled; and until such certificate is received let it be unlawful to strike the names of such persons from the lists.

As already remarked, no enrollment should be ordered until it is clearly foreseen that a draft must be made, taking care, however, to allow a sufficient time between enrollment and draft for the thorough and careful perfection of the lists, so that none can plead that opportunity was not afforded them for compliance with the law.

It will be seen that under the operation of such an enrollment act as is here proposed not only is the original enrollment made with incomparably less difficulty, time, and expense, but it becomes thereafter throughout the whole continuance of the war, and without any additional expense whatever, self-revising, so that each State will thereafter be always ready for any new assignment of quotas and any additional drafts. It is also morally certain that an enrollment made under the provisions of such a law would be far more complete and reliable than by the present or any other system; for, beyond all question, just as but a very small percentage of the tax-payers of a community incur the hazard of losing their estates by neglecting to pay their taxes, so a like unimportant portion of the arms-bearing population of any sub-district would voluntarily incur the stern penalties of imprisonment and fine by seeking to evade the requirements of such a military enactment; and not only would the number of delinquents be very small from the nature of the case, but it would be constantly and rapidly reduced by the hearty assistance rendered by all who had themselves complied with the law, every one of whom would be urged by the strongest incentives of personal interest to bring forward such delinquents or report them for punishment.

As already intimated, I am fully convinced that it is not only the indisputable right of the Government in time of war to secure the services of its citizen soldiery in the summary manner here recommended, but that the justice and reasonableness of the exercise of the right would be generally acquiesced in by the people, especially in view of its impartial fairness, simplicity, and economy, and the swift retribution which would by it overtake tories and cowards and skulkers of every name and class. In respect to the superior economy of the proposed measure, a glance at the expense account connected with the enrollment in this State, and I doubt not equally in every other State, is conclusive. By reference to Schedule No. 5 of the Appendix to this report it will be seen that the Government has paid, in the various enrollments and revisions which have been made in this State, for 47,282 days" service, at $3 per day, amounting to $141,840, being about $16 per man for each of the 8,941 men obtained by the draft. And by comparison of the cost of enrollment alone, as
