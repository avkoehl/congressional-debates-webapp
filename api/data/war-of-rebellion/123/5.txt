Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

Assistant Secretary Fox, of Navy Department, writes here that he is sorry to find Massachusetts proposes building an iron-clad steamer for Navy Department; intends putting under construction all that the utmost mechanical resources of country can accomplish. Therefore he prays us to desist from undertaking. Is that your opinion also?
