Mr. SHERMAN". I present the proceedings
of the Cincinnati Board of Underwriters in re-
gard to the Cincinnati and Newport bridge,
and also the opinion of Western river pilots in .
regard to bridging the Ohio river. They rep-
resent that the construction of a bridge of less
than five hundred feet span over the lower part
of the Ohio river would be detrimental to the
interests of commerce. I move that these peti-
tions take the course of the petitions already
presented by the Senator from Indiana on this
subject.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. They will
be referred to the Committee on Post Offices
and Post Roads.

-Mr. SUMNEIi. I present, a memorial from
the America!) Geographical and Statistical So-
ciety, iti which they set forth that having closely
studied the existing authentic sources of inform-
ation, both official and private, concerning the
northwestern territory recently ceded to the
United States by the Russian Government, they
find eminent reason to believe that the terri-
tory possesses resources of much greater value
and importance than has heretofore been gen-
erally supposed, and whose rapid development
by explorations in geodesy and natural his-
tory is highly necessary to the general interests
of our country, of science, and of commerce.
Therefore they ask Congress that the earliest
possible action may be taken by the Govern-
ment of the United States to secure a proper
survey and examination upon the coast and
within, the Territory of Alaska, by officers ot
the United States Coast Survey and other
gentlemen of competent scientific ability and
experience. I hardly know to what committee
I should have this memorial referred ; but on
consideration I conclude that it is best to move
its reference to the Committee on Appropria-
tions. I make that motion.
The motion was agreed to.
REPOltTS OP COMMITTEES.
Mr. TRUMBULL, from the Committee on
the Judiciary, to whom was referred the hill

â€¢and post road, and for other purposes, reported

postponement of the hill; which was agreed to.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The Committee on the
Judiciary, to whom was referred the bill (H.
li. No. 274) providingforholdinga circuit court
at the city of Eric, Pennsylvania, have directed
me to report it back adversely, and to ask its
indefinite postponement. That subject has
been disposed of, and the committee would like
to get it off the Calendar by taking the ques-

The PRESI DENT pro tempore. The ques-

bill.

ommend its passage; and, as there is nothing
else particularly occupying the attention of
the Senate, I should he very glad if they would
proceed to the consideration of the resolution
now.
i By unanimous consent, the Senate, as in
I Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
j sider the joint resolution, it proposes to au-
thorize the Postmaster General to change the

BRIDGES ON/TlIIO AND MISSISSIPPI RIVERS.
SEY. I wish now, if it be in
ord^, to'move to reconsider a resolution that
was passed at the instance of the Senator from
Indiana [Mr. Morton] on Thursday last, pro-
posing to recommit a certain bridge bill, pro-
posing to construct a bridge on the Ohio, to
the Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads,
with instructions.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is in
order, if there be no further morning busi-
ness.
Mr. RAMSEY. I make the motion with a
view of calling the attention of the Senator to
what I think, as a member of that committee,
would be the wiser course in regaid to the
proposed bridges upon the Ohio river, about
which there seems, from the number of peti-
tions presented recently, to be considerable
feeling in the city of Cincinnati and other
towns upon the river. In the appropriation
bill for rivers and harbors, approved June 27,
18GU, an appropriation was made, among other
flings, " for examining and reporting upon
the subject of constructing railroad bridges
across the Mississippi liver between St. Paul,
in Minnesota, and St. Louis, in the State of
Missouri, upon such plans of construction as
will offer the least impediment to the naviga-
tion of the river."
In pursuance of this authority the engineer
bureau of the War Office have since been mak-
ing surveys and examinations with a view of
determining the kind of bridge that the inter-
ests of navigation and the interests of the
railroads proposing to cross the river would
mutually allow. 1 would respectfully suggest
to the Senator from Indiana that in the appro-
priation bill making appropriations for river
and harbor improvements now pending a simi-
lar clause be inserted in regard to the Ohio
river; and if it is ihe desire of the people of
the Ohio valley and of the railroads who seek
to cross that river that action should be de-
ferred till such a report is made, the committee
to whom this bill is recommitted need take no
action until a report be had from the engineer
bureau.
Mr. MORTON. I should like to inquire of
the cliaiiinan of the Post Office Committee
whether, under the provision of the statute to
which he has referred, any survey or examina-
tion of the Ohio river is to be made, or is it
confined to the upper Mississippi?
Mr. RAMSEY. It is confined to the upper
Mississippi. I lie character of the two livers
diliurs very mueh. The Ohio liver ri^e^ thirty ,
forty, or laity feet at times. I think 1 have
never known the Mississippi to rise more than
ten feet at St. Paul, certainly, and I think not
: more than that at any point between there and
j St. Louis.
i ihe motion of the Senator from Indiana,
â–  however, had reference to but one bill. There
j is another bill pending. House bill No. 723, pro-
â–  po.sing to budge the Ohio river. It is entitled
1 a supplement to an act approved July iil, 1862,
