In addition to this, I call attention to the fol-
lowing facts: the Patent Officc is supported by
fees ; the statement which I have given shows
that there is a constant fund on hand, which
ought to be, as it is called, "covered into the
Treasury," that is, paid in under a " covering
warrant:"

It is here seen that the number of applica-
tions for patents received in 1865 exceeded, by
nearly forty per cent., the number filed in any
previous year, and the number of caveats filed
exceeded those of any previous year by more
than seventy-five per cent. The number of
patents issued exceeded those issued in 1864,
the highest previous year, by more than thirty
per cent.
The receipts into the patent fund exceed
those of any former year by more than thirty-
six per cent., while the expenditures were only
increased a trifle over eight per cent., and a
considerable surplus is left to the credit of the
patent fund.
I think it is manifest that the inventors of the
country ought not to be taxed as heavily as
they are now. In other words, the fees for
procuring patents should be reduced.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I suggest
to the gentleman that he modify the resolution
by striking out the words "after paying ex-
penses." All the money received ought to go
into the Treasury, and then* appropriations
should be made to pay the expenses.
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. It is merely a
resolutionof inquiry. The committee will have
the whole matter before them.
The resolution was agreed to.

safe conduct of the public business therein. Also,
whether the interest of the Government would not
be butter subserved by selling the present building

Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I must
object to that.
Mr. ASHLEY, of Ohio. It is merely a call
for information.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I atn
afraid it will lead to some expenditure here-

citizens in foreign States, the pending question
upon the bill being the motion of the gentleman
from Massachusetts, [Mr. Banks,] to recommit
it to the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Mr. BROOMALL. Very well; then I am
willing to yield to a motion to adjourn.

now adjourn.
The motion was agreed to ; and accordingly
