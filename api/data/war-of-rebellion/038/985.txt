HEADQUARTERS DIVISION, July 1, 1863.

MAJOR MEMMINGER, Assistant Adjutant-GENERAL:

Colonel [T. P.] Dockery reports from near Graveyard roads as follows:

The enemy are moving a force from my front and left toward the Jackson road. I cannot see enough of the force to judge of its strength. I can see several stand of colors.

I have just written a note to General Smith, notifying him of the above, and of the damage to our works on the road by the explosion of the mine, and to request him to hold a portion of his troops in readiness to move to our assistance, but that the call will not be made for troops unless our positions are carried, or we are hard pressed.

HEADQUARTERS ADAMS' REGIMENT, July 1, 1863-4 p. m. Captain GEORGE MOORMAN,Assistant Adjutant-GENERAL:

CAPTAIN: Enemy quit in front. Lieutenant [William C.] Gibson, of my regiment, was within three-fourths of a mile of Edwards yesterday on a scout. He reports none of the enemy south of the railroad at that point. From a citizen just from the Federal lines, he learned that the force this side of Big Black consists of a corps and one DIVISION. The corps crossed at Bovina, the DIVISION above; he thinks at Bridgeport. The scout's impression, from what he could learn, was that this advance of the enemy was for the purpose of calling General Johnston's attention from Port Hudson, to which point Grant has sent 30,000 re-enforcements to Banks. The information from the citizen regarding the crossing of the corps at Bovina is, I think, reliable.

I am, captain, yours, very respectfully,

WIRTH ADAMS,

Colonel, Commanding.
