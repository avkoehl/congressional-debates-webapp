Now, (said Mr W ,) if wc look at the acts of
Congiess, it wnl be found that several of them
Lave been passed specially receiving tnese lands
tobe leased, and therefore these lands, having
been specially rpserved, are excluded under the
co ístiuction very pioperly given by the Secretary
of the Tieasuiy, that the pieemption laws never
were intended to apply to them The case being
so vei y cieai, he could not consent to receive the
amendment
Mr CLAY, of Alabama, appealed to his fiiend
from Mississippi, [Mr Walker,] as home Sen-
ators appealed to have doubts on the subject, to
assent to a pioviso that would ltmovcall the (Jif*
ficulties suggested He thought that two lines
would accomplish this object, and he had acooid
mgly diawn up an amendment, which he hoped
might be taken by general consent
Mi   C   then submitted the following
Pío i let! Í li it tin let s!i ill not be so con trued is to
give the right of pieuupi on m inv ci c wii tt \er
Mr L\ON obseived tint he would certainly
make no objection to this or any othei amendment
which gentlemen thought necesstuy to iendei the
bill moie cleat in us exclusion of pieemp'ion
rights He would observe, howevci, that he was
in favoi of giving this light, and was about, when
the bill ivas oidcied to be engiosseii, to object to
it because it excluded preemptions He know
men who hadspentmeny yeaisof then lives,and
ten 01 fifteen thousand dolíais of then capital, in
improving these mineral lands, who would, if the
bill became a law, have to entei into competition
with othei purch iscrs foi then own impiovc
merits He thought the claims of these pi isons
very stiong, in 1 much íegietted that no provision
was made tor them
Mi L ,aftf r a few more obsoivations, h ft ired
to the tot of IbJO dnd the act oí the last sesst _>n,
for tl e putp^e ( f showing that no pieempt on
right exist d as to mineial 1 mik
Mi N il-íC s exnu ssed his doubts whe her the
pioviso w ni'd effect the object m view
No amendment ben g in ordei but by unani
mons consent, and Mi W \LkER ob|ecting to
the one just oiieied, the question was then taken
on leconsideung the vote oidoiing the bill to be
engrossed, and it was earned without a division
Mr CLAY, of Alabama, then it o wed his mo-
tion to amend, and the pioviso submitted by lum
was read
Mi   CALHOUN gave it as his opinion that it
would be better to put suoh a pioviso m the bill
as to prt ventthe possibility 0   my such consti ue
tion being given to it I y the ottic    s )f the Gov
pinment as to allow of piccmpti ins undei i     He
did not believe that the bill ont ued   my such
right  butas the lands weie valuable,  v  ly means'
would be employed ti bung them within the pit
emption laws, the ablest lawyi is would  be en   |
gaged, and eveiy soit of mtcimi ly bought t> I
beai tp induce the Tiiastuy ciTieeis to give   uch I
a construction as would open them to pieemption
claims
Mi    ROBINSON   thought  that the bill bore
haidly on those interested m mining opeiations
A gieat many of these persons had made laige
expenditures in woikmg the mines, and weie as
much entitled to reli f as an i othei  scttleison
public 1 tnds     1 he uha of the mi íeis, as well as
he could undeistmd it, was that eieh md vidual
should have a preemption light to that poition |
which he worked, and tl is in no case exeetded i
ten acies     The difficulty of miking thesi small '
divisions alone, induced lum to coi sent to the
passage of the bill
The qui stion was the l taken on the pi "tviso of ¡
Mi   Ci «, of Alabama, and it was adopted with
a slight modification
The bill was then ordeied to be engiossed, and
by unanimous consent passed as amended
The bill for the relief of the corporate authon
ties of the city of Mobile
After the consideiatton of executive business,
The Senate adjourned until Monday next
the Union, foi the purpose of resuming the con
' sideration of the President's message
But, at the request of Mr WISE, Mr H with-
' drew his motion for the piesent
HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES
Eridw, December 28, 1838
Immediately aftei the leading of the Journal,
Mi   HACINES lose, and asked the House now
to go into Committee of the Whole on the state of
PLBL1C DEFAULTERS.
Mr WISE then, on leave given, offered a mo-
tion to print twenty thousand copies extra of
Documents Nos 111 and 297 of the 2d session of
the 2oth Congress, (both being documents in re-
lation to public defaulters )
Mi CURTIS hoped the gentleman from Vir-
ginia [Mr Wise] would modify his motion, so
as to include ten thousand extra copies of the re-
port from the Secreta! y of the Treasury in rela-
tion to the defalcation of Mi   Swartwout
Mi   WISE modified his motion accordingly
Mi    DC GRAPF suggested twenty thousand ¡
copies of this latter document, end Mr   WISE
again modified his motion accoidingly                    I
Mi    CAMBRLLENG said that, as he pie- I
sumed the gentleman ftorn Virginia wished to have
documents punted of five oi six hundred pages, |
which Mi  C thoughtit was veiy doubtful wheth
er any one would read, he hoped that they would
be printed sepatately
Mr WISE said he had no objection, it being
his desire to have them so punted                            I
Mr  BOND moved that the punting be done m '
such order that the documents having reference
to the same persons might appear consecutively  |
Mi WISE hoped th< gentleman fiom Ohio
[Mr Bovd] would suííet the printing to be se- i
cured in the fust instance Ihe document lead |
the othei night in i elation to public defaulters,
was puntrd in such a manner as to piesent the
id a, at fust sight, that the Sei ictai y ot the Titas-
uiy had been veiy aetive, veiy energetic indeed,
in keeping the public oil! eis to then duty but
when the lcttcis to ceitain individuals (Harmand
Biyd) came to be extmin tl it was íound, th t
so f ii fiom puttin   the s mis up to the towds in
th< sid 9 of publi d Idulteis, h hid only been
wuting Uiun Utteis of supplica ion He hoped
Mi   B  would withdiavv his motion
Mi BOiND,aiiPi i xpiessing his opinion, that
beloie the pi in ting, the becictai y should be called
upon to state vv hethei all tin documents weie
genuine or not, consented to do so
So the last mentioned motion was withdi twn
Mi   CR\RYinqu led of the Chan lftheiewas

ber of the House be fui nisbed w th copies of the
Executive cnmmunie itious   of the last session5
On iet ei\ ing til at swei m the affirmative, he said
tint he consideicd it to be his duty to object to
the punting called loi by the motion of the gen
tleman fiom Viigima, [VIi   Wise ]    One of the
documents mentioned had bfoii punted fn  the
use ot the niembe s, and m t \tia nuinbei lot dis

would m  t) spietd false information   If the gen-
tleman fiom \ ugiim [Mi   Wisi] would specify
any pirticulai  d icumciit, the print ng of which
was icquiMte, he would go fu it
Mi    1TLLIN&HVM' said  In   could íiadly

is to the objects of the e\[ensc, letienching in
cases wheie the object was not so much to mfoim

and arguments in favoi of particulai theoues or

instance, also, the President s annual message as j
a paper upon the printing of which, without the i
accompanying documents, fai too much of the I
public money was penodicaliy expended The
numbei ordeied to be printed was always, m his
opinion, unnecessarily laige That papei, m the
foim usually given to it, could hardly be called a
document, in the appropriate and stnet sense of
that term It was rather a commentary upon
facts communicated m it, than the origina! and
simple evidence of facts The laigest portion of
it was sure to be an argument, drawn up, gener-
ally, with great ability and care, sometimes with
gieat art and adroitness, intended to impress upon
the public mind the particular opinions and views,
and, pethaps, also to advance in public estima-
tion, the particulai cause, prospects, or hopes, of
the individual authoi But the veiy interest which
it necessarily excited—the eager and impatient
interest with which it was expected by the whole
country—ms,uted for it, without the aid of Con-
gress or of the public purse, the eaihest and most
extensive publication Before the leading can be
half finished in this Hall, it is gone miles away,
flying forth in every direction, upon the swiftest
wings of fiery expedition, to eveiy portion, pop-
ulous or waste, of the vast Republic It is re-
printed at eveiy press, and read at the most dig-
!l tant fiiesides,Iong before the extra copies oideied
11 by this House reach oui desks
To these and to other like subjects of expense,
' let the gentleman apply his economy and re-
trenchment, and thus save and secuie a liberal
b fund foi furnishing the people with infoimation
' and evidence, instead of aigumentand opinion,
ij with facts, instead of theories and piojects, with
11 such original, undistorted, and authentic proofs
of facts and tiansactions of the highest interest
as aie contained in the documents which are the
subject of the present motion In this course he
would cordially cooperate But he could not but
feel suiprise and regietthat tnere should be, in
any quaiter, or in any portion of this House—
i paiticularly in that portion fiom which the oppo-
sition seemed about to come—an objection to giv-
ing to the people the naked, ungaimshed tiuths
containi d m thes° documents Whence did these
documents como? Piom a high Department of
our Government, oitgmated in that Department,
and authenticated by its head They weie not
only the best evid nee of tiansactions on which
the people had a light to be truly mfoimed, but
the two most important documents were ill truth
the very tiansactions themselves This was the
soit ol info mation which it was not only expe-
dient and proper that the representatives of the
people should furnish, and which they were ex-
pected to furnish to their constituents, but which
it was the light of then constituents to have, and
which it was neeessaiy they should have to en-
able them to fotm atiue judgment of the doings
and intentions of those whom they intrust with
powei, and to act correctly in the performance of
then own civil duties, and the exercise of their
own civil nghts Heie were the ac s and pro-
ceeding )f then public functionaries, whole and
ungarbledand undistorted, uncoloied by declama-
tion, undisguisi d by sophisti y, going directly and
naked 'o the mind, the intelligence of the nation,
with all then original motives, modifications, and
cbjeets fresh upon them Why should they be
suppressed' Ihey were of the highest interest
to all who feel an interest in the administration of
that \ ist Executive power which, legitimately or
illegitimately, for good or evil, is exercised and
brought to beai upon all the conciins of society,

finances tnd the pationige of the nation, to the
wielding of that power of poweis, the money

uid its ajioliancis, overreaches, subsidizes, and
eintiols ill other jwwers Now , it could not be
disguised that genuine, perfect, unsophisticated
infoimation of the acts of public servants, from
the highest to the lowest, was the gieat want of
the freemen of this countiy It was of the ut-
most impoitance fot the sifet, of their free in-
stitutions, and for the secuuty of their means of
life and h tppiness, that they should have it Their
íepiesentatives weie intiusted with the power and
means of furnishing them with it, and it seemed
to him that this was a most fit occasion for exer-
cising that pov er
