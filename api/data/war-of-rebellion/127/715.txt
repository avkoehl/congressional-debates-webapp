arising, out of this condition of things rendered it necessary to put into active operation the office of adjutant-general. The labors of this office have been very extensive and beneficial, notwithstanding the fact that they have been performed under lame and inefficient laws. The results may readily be seen in the present organized condition of our military strength. In the present crisis it is a very important branch of the public service, and that you may be the better informed as to its past transactions and of its future requirements, I respectfully refer you to the very explicit report of the adjutant-general herewith transmitted (Doc. A). *

The encampment of U. s. forces near Indianola became early in the administration an object of attention. These troops were departing from the State by virtue of an agreement between General Twiggs and the commissioners of the convention. In conformity with these stipulations they were to retain a full complement of arms and ammunition. Thus provided, they had collected to the extent of several companies at Green Lake under the pretense of awaiting transportation from our shores. From the threatening aspect which affairs had assumed it was not improbable that the Federal Government would order these 600 or 700 well-appointed troops to take possession of and hold this sea-port, to our very serious disadvantage. Therefore it was deemed a matter of policy, if not of absolute necessity, to require their immediate embarkation in compliance with the terms of the agreement before mentioned. Accordingly a commission under the immediate control of the adjutant-general was authorized to make this demand, and if it was not complied with to call out a force sufficient to capture and disarm them. This commission was proceeding promptly to the discharge of its duty when the opportune arrival of General Wan Dorn, with full authority to effect this same purpose, superseded the necessity of further action on its part.

The vulnerability of the sea-coast was now an object of earnest solicitude, and it was the duty of the Executive of Texas to urge its defense upon the Confederate Government. This was done and the President requested to send immediately a competent engineer to make an examination and report upon those fortifications which were taken of sending several hundred stand of arms from those seized at San Antonio, to be used in the defense of Matagorda Bay and Galveston Island. Steps were taken at the same time to have the heavy guns which had been captured at Fort Clark conveyed to the coast. About this time the able Confederate officer who had been designated to command the military department arrived. Thus rested an important subject in appropriate hands and relieved the States of that which she had not the power to accomplish. As an efficient step to secure the military defenses of our northern border, Colonel W. C. Young was authorized to raise a regiment of cavalry. This movement was demanded by the probability of an invasion in this quarter. Difficulties accumulating in the States north of us, it became necessary to increase this force, and accordingly three additional regiments were raised similar to the first. If an invasion had been projected toward us, it seemed to be the policy of Texas to meet it as far as possible from her own limits. With a view to this purpose, Colonel Flurnou was sent as a special commissioner to the Governor of Missouri to concert such measures as the ability of Texas and the welfare and safety of both States should
