APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL 6LQBB.
Jaly, 1841,
27th Cong...-1st Sess.
Fiscal Bank—Mr. Morehead.
Senate.
collected from every quaiter of that great ¡State to deliberate
upon the destinies ol our common country, and, while ill
voices were raised in unanimous reprobation of the odious Sub
Treasury system, not a solitary word was uttered } kadiog the
mentsofa National Bank If the his ory of the laie canvass
coutd be impartially and faithfully written fiom cintemporaoe
ous materials, such, I am convinced, would b« found to have
been its actual course in at least three fourths oí the tetates of
this Union
The ¡Senator from Kentucky has reminded me—rather un
graciously, I think, considering how long he took <*heitei with
me under the same roof—ofihe nun ble halfway hou&e, (the
State banks,)foi which he supposes rae still to retain a prefe
rence Far four long years did the I onorable ¡Senatoi himself
inhabit this half way house valnnt y defending it with all the
vigor of his prowess and eloquence against the fierce assaults of
the forces of theiate Administration, and, if I am not gieaciy
¿mistaken, even as late as hi5! celebrated Hanover speech last
summer, he recognised it to be a fair competitor uf his own pre
terred expedient (a National Bank) for the public favor dectar
ing that the choice between them should be le t to the future
and defiberatejudgment of the people
/ [Mr Clay No, you are mistaken I recognise \ it only as
i   a pis uller ]
Mr Rives A pis alter is about as much is it. left to u&
Not having the speech of the honorable Sor i oi before me, I
will not contest the matter with him, thouarh 1 n ay take oeca
sioii heuafiu to refiesh the ipollecuon of the Scnatoi *
What, sir, was the bill of the Senator which was sent to the Pie
sidenent but apis aller? Accoidmg to the Senator'^ own state
mentuwasa very different thirg from what he would have
made it. In its location, m its name and charietei and espe
cially in the so-called iompromisc section, which the 8enatoi
tells us he introduced in a spirit of the exti ernes' concess on, lie
agreed to make it a very different thing fiom dn old fishioned
Bank ofthe United States, the beauzdeal of cui íency and finance
in the eyes of the slenatoi The Senitoi's own bill then, was
but a pis aller, and there cannot be much choice, I presumt,
between one pis allei and another
Ihe Senator from Kentucky says he found nv ^evual yeais
ago in this half way house, which, alter the thoiough riddling
the roof had received in the breaking up of the pethanksvs
tem, he had supposed I would h<tve abandoned    liowtoull I
find it in my heat t Mi Piesident,to abandon it when I fnmd
the honorable Senatot fiom Kentucky (even abet what he calls
the nddimgof the roofj so anx ous to take refuge in it from the
rums of his own condemned and repudia cd^yst m, an 1 where
he actually took refuse for lour long ye its, is I have ahcaely
