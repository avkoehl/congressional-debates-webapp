be appointed, whose duty it shall be to thoroughly examine each and all of said charges as preferred against me, and that said court shall be required not merely to report the facts but to give their opinion on the merits of the case.

I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. HOLT,

Judge-Advocate-General.

[Indorsement.*]

This application having been submitted to the President and considered by him, it is not deemed to be expedient to order a court of inquiry. The President is entirely satisfied with the honesty and fidelity of the Judge-Advocate-General in the matters referred to in the application, and that there is no ground to impeach his personal or official honor and integrity, and that his conduct requires no inquiry or vindication. For this reason a court of inquiry is deemed unnecessary. In this view the Secretary of War fully concurs.
