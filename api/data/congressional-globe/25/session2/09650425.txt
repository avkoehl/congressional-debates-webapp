gjTH Cong—2nd Sess.
Independent Treasury—Mr. Bynum.
H. of Reps.
upon wh. ch the banks fed, it was upon their labor
that they existed and enriched themselves, and it
was the profits of their industry that they filched
«nd wrong from the hands that made it. If the
banks are the people, so are jour mosques, inquisi-
tions, priesthoods, and other abominable institu-
tions that have for so many centuries robbed and
oppressed, and impoverished mankind Have the
people not been ever told, in all ages, that these in-
stitutions of horror and misery weie first erected
for their especial benefit? Identical are the rea-
sons advanced now that were then, to lull, deceive,
and oppress then, and every step we take, shows
ths existence of some add tional analogy that bank-
ing institutions have to those long since founded on
pieslcraft.
Bat I will a?am return to this gentleman and re-
presentative of the marble palace, who has evinced
so much sophistry and cunning to work in lav or of
the banks, or a bank, with the people. The gen-
tleman had spoken of we new era Now new dis-
eases, I think, have ever leqmred new íemedies
The existence of btmkcrajt was entirely unknown, to
the ancient world—they had other modes of
fleecing the pcoplt—and ts now but partially known
to the modern world Its pernicious effects have
but recently developed themselves amongst us, and
consequent y, the discovery oí every remedy of the
disease, must be of the " new era " Yes, the dis-
covery of the whole system of free constitutional
government, belongs to the " new era " The
ancitnt/eii<M sj stems of crafts and oppiession may,
however, be more palateable to the taste oí that
gentleman, than any system oí impiovement of
modern date, or of " the new era "
The honorable member had next adverted to tbx
State banks, and labored with much ingenuity 10
rail) them against the Government for political
effect He had endeavoied to excite the States,
and alienate them irom the General Government,
first by flattening them, ard then appealing to their
pride, and telling them that tney had been insulted
and their rights usurped by the General Govern-
ment. Do gtnilemi n think that gieat State , as
well as silly individuals, are to be caught by the
efforts ol demagogueism'* Do they think to play
off on them, without their motives and designs
being suspected, detet ted, and e\p ed? Yes, sn,
they do' So little knowledge have these city
declaimets and Federal oratois of the plain, homM
countiy people, that ths y sincerely believe that
nothing imaginable is moie easy than ¡or them to
practice <uul play off upon their ignorance and
oMuiity These are some ot the old aits ogam
attempted m anew nay, to enlist the people against
thetr own Grovtinmr at—formed, erected and insti-
tuted by themselves, equally fot tne good and hap
pnessofall The irieiubtt made a gieat efloit, at
least as great as he was capable ol, to conjure up
and excite the Siate Legislature* against the Gene-
ral Government They, too, had been appealed to
with an intent most obvioasly and palpably to be
enlisted m the cause oí the banks agam^t the peo
pie and their Administration They were told by
the honorable gent'eman, v i what design we all
know, that they hid been treated with contumely
and contempt by this Administration Such weie
the artifices and sophistry resorted to by that mem-
ber to further the views of his parly, and to sustain
the accursed system of fraud and deception bv
which his dearly beloved b inking institutions had
so long, with impunity and arrogance, practised
upon the people of this country
Sir, what rights of the States lias this Adminis-
tration interfered with or invaded 1 What insults
has it offered to the Legislatures of these States i
"Where and when was it done 1 What Sta'e has
been so debased as to have submitted thus long to
such ignominy t Such declarations are foul slan-
ders upon the independence, intelligence, and pa-
triotism of the Legislatures of these States, and the
wemoers that composed them, and in so manv
■words, is saying, that they have been composed of
aten heretofore teo ignorant to have discovered it,
or, if they were not ignorant, they wanted both the
patriotism and independence to resist and expose
such usurpations, insults, and violations of their
nghl Then \l ts a poor compliment that the mem-
W has paid those States,, whose intelligence, inde-
pendence, and patriotism he ha.s thus attempted to
sport with, if not a most direct insult which he
h mself has offered to their understandings. The
member not only undervalues the good sense of the
mass of the people, but depreciates and underrates
the common sense, intelligence, and sagacity of the
members oí the State Legislatures.
This is carrying their contempt for the good
sense of me people, a little further than usual But
this is " their way " It is the ancient rock upon
which they have ever split—that eternal want of
confidence in the intelligence of the common
peop e, and overrating their own, is their bane,
from which no age nor experience have ever been
able to purify the aristocracy of a country The
effect  of then gulling system have, on every
occasion, proved temporary and ephemeral, and
so long as enterpiise and mdustiy are left free
from the trammel , shackles, and restraints foiged
for them by the devices and arts of the " cralt
family," they may never expect other than a har-
vest of fatal disappointments, and victories as
ephemeral as delusive
The   honorable member [Mr   Scroeant] has
certainly    laid   under   the    greatest   obligations
to him  the  inert   and   stupid  politician  of  the
great States of Virginia and New York, for whose
nbhts and interest lies has affected so much sensibi-
lity on this occasion    The policy of New York,
and the recent acts of Virginia, the honorable
member  has dwelt on with  ecstacies of delight
Sir,  Ihe^e States may feel  not a little honored
when his motives are scanned and  resolved  into
their original elements, and they may soon learn
whethel oi not ihe whole of his speech and com-
pliments to  them, was not a  recruiting concern,
intended for the  solitary design of using them  to
furthei his own  selfish and   favorite svstem  of
banking, and the views of that patty     That mem-
ber, on marly eveiy occasion,   had used the word
people lor banks    This; is another analogy to the
practice ol   the "pncilkood" who evei operated

The gentleni 11 and his p vrty havt  suddenly I (lien

nounced with a sarcasm and  indignation never to

Sir, what a btauliful moral eloes it not teach, to
see two sainted bre'luen of Ihe sam- prmci¡ It*,
from the same high temp'e, laboring in the same
cause, preaching m different places, and at diffe-
rent times, doc unes so adverse, so inconsistent,
so contradictor, to ptomote the same holy cause
On this I invoke the tamlm, impartial leihctiou of
a liberal woild 'Thou hypocrite' thinkcst thou
that mm loi you alen  was made'" Sir, fiom
these loathing attempts the heart turns and íckens
with disgust
The honorable nvmber, again, has told us that
the bank^ were u ipopuiat, and it was deemed po-
pular to denounce them, and indicated that Pum-
dent Jackson, and the party that sustained him, did
it to gam popularity This is perfectly in charae-
u r with hts other assertions, unsustamed by the
facts, contrary to experience, and unfounded in
truth.   What were the facts'! what the truth? what

our own experience? which no   sophistry, nor the
" crafts" of the cunning, can rob us of.
Up to 1832, the United States. Bank was one of
the most popular institutions that had existed m
this or any other country, laudats, hymns, and jere-
miads were sung in every section of the country in.
Us praise Then, sir, it was (I recollect it well)
political death to question, or to doubt even, its m-
iallibihtj, to do it, faggots and stakes were imme-
diately threatened to the political heretic, and he
had trembl ngly to whisper hisdissent to the dogmas
it contained Then it «as the most popular hobby
that could have been mounted No crime then to
speak of tbr  paragon ot modem invention' L.
1832 and '33, in this House, there was an immense
majority in its favor, and a like one in the Senate.
A bill was then passed by both House*, by an over-
whelming majotiu, in favor of its recharter, when,
the old Roman—born to blessflns race, to preserve
and prot ct the liberties of his country—with a mien
undaunted, but chaiacteiistic of himsell, with a
heart that neither honors nor threats could alarm,
and a courage that has never failed him—threw
himself into the breach, and waved aloft once more
the proud banner ol the Constitution, and sum-
moned thereto the drowsy I riends. of Democracy,
of equal rights, and of freedom, to arouse and rally
to the íescue The bill was vitoed The Veto
message went forth, amidst the thuBders and ana-
themas of the high paesis ot the cralt But, sir,
the old Roman quailed not He who had seen a
little service was not lobe alarmed by the di ciarge
of paper caronnades. Heappealed to his country-
men for a justification of his act, and they re-
sponded in language not to be misunderstood
The principles of the message were confirmed
by theappiohatioH of the people The conduct of
the Bank was in<esiigatcd in eveiv canvass in
eveiy Slate, us datiaeu and corruptions exposed
and condi mned by an intelligent public, and not
until iu hideous features had been exposed, did it
become unpopular unh the people of ilns country.
Its arrogant and precocious muoduction into this
hall in lbj.2—its entering on the political arena,
demanding its ch.irter to be lonewed, aroused the
people to its audacious bearing It was done to
piotluce a political etlcct at ihe time It was to el-

unpopular, but became so by its own acts. Such

did and ru w uudeistand them.
Ihe g< ntleman h s boaued that the Gover ment
had not a dollar to discharge its debts with, a ccu'd
not pay off its wirkmen An I why, let me ask
the honorable m mber, did he not tell us the rea-
son? He well knew the leason was that his fa-
vorite oanks had m their vaults the money of ths
Gotemmen , and tefused to pay them out one dol-
lar, and sir, there is a party here that ts back'ag

the dehcits of the Treasury have been brought
about entirely by the inability uf the Government
to collect the funds due it, and deposited by law in
other institutions—a circumstance brc ught about
entirely by the operation of his most favored banks,
and showing, most conclusively, the fatal effect
that must result from these institutions, when m
