CUMBERLAND GAP, TENN., August 19, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

We are enveloped by the enemy. His pickets extend across the Cumberland Mountains on either flank of the Gap. He imagines that I will evacuate the Gap and waits to enter it. I shall never do so. It is for you to open the road. What you most want is cavalry and horse artillery, with a heavy column to follow after; but you must act at once, for our supplies are limited. In the mean time I will not be idle. If the enemy attacks he will be crushed.

GEORGE W. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General.

(Same to General Boyle.)

Major-General HALLECK, Commanding:

Received the following dispatch this date from Colonel Cranor, Fortieth Ohio, at Portsmouth, Ohio:
HEADQUARTERS FORTIETH OHIO REGIMENT, Portsmouth, Ohio, 18th.

General BOYLE:

The rebel General John S. Williams' brigade is now in the valley of Big Sandy. Will soon be joined by Marshall's whole division, estimated at from 4,000 to 12,000, besides cavalry, and artillery. I must have help or all is lost in Eastern Kentucky. I hope you will send us help without delay.

FRANKFORT, KY., August 19, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I applied to General Boyle, the proper officer at Louisville, for arms, and the dispatch sent yesterday was after application to him. I am acting under the authority of the Governor of Kentucky and in conjunction with the Military Board, and in obedience to orders of the Secretary of War. I am, according to the laws of Kentucky, the proper officer in the State to superintend recruiting, and have performed that service since September last. Confusion has arisen from the fact that orders to recruit here have been given both to General Boyle and the Military Board by the War Department. General Boyle having now turned over all recruiting to this department, and Kentucky now having a loyal Governor, I trust there will be more regularity hereafter.

Respectfully,

JNumbers W. FINNELL,

Adjutant-General Kentucky Volunteers.
