going to Trenton thinking that my force might be wanted here, and having all the information that I could get by advancing in person, I recrossed and turned back. Moore will come via Dresden, and Heinrichs via Gardner's Station, both conscripting as they come. They will be here to-morrow. If the general has no objections, I will go in to talk to him to-morrow evening.

My spy has gone to Jackson to get news of the artillery. He and others will inform me of any movement in this direction. I shall hold all the crossings of the Obion River from to-morrow night.
