CAVALRY HEADQUARTERS,

April 5, 1865.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States

GENERAL: From present indications the retreat of the enemy is rapidly becoming a rout. We are shelling their trains and preparing to attack their infantry immediately. Their troops are moving on their left flank and I think we can break and disperse them.

Everything should be hurried forward with the utmost speed. If General Ord can be put in below it will probably use them up.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Near Jetersville, April 5, 1865-3 p.m. (Received 6.30 p.m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

GENERAL: I send you the inclosed letter, which will give you an idea of the condition of the enemy and their whereabouts. I sent General Davies' brigade this morning around on my left flank. He captured at Paine's Cross-Roads 5 pieces of artillery, about 200 wagons, and 8 or 9 battle-flags, and a number of prisoners. The Second Army Corps is now coming up. I wish you were here yourself. I feel confident of capturing the Army of Northern Virginia if we exert ourselves. I see no escape for Lee. I will put all my cavalry out on our left flank except Mackenzie, who is now on the right.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

AMELIA COURT-HOUSE, April 5, 1865.

DEAR MAMMA: Our army is ruined, I fear. We are all safe as yet. Shyron left us sick. John Taylor is well; saw him yesterday. We are in line of battle this evening. General Robert Lee is in the field near us. My trust is still in the justice of our cause and that of God. General Hill is killed. I saw Murray a few moments since. Bernard Terry [he] said was taken prisoner, but may get out. I send this by a negro I see passing up railroad to Mecklenburg. Love to all.*

Your devoted son,

WM. B. TAYLOR,

Colonel.
