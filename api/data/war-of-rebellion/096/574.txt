EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

CITY POINT, VA., February 17, 1865-8.30 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The rebel flag-of-truce boat William Allison, while on her upward trip from Cox's Landing, this afternoon, was blow up by a torpedo. The boat went down almost immediately. Our pickets saw no survivors from her. There were no prisoners aboard at the time. This catastrophe probably arose from one of the enemy's own torpedoes which has been in the water for a long time.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
