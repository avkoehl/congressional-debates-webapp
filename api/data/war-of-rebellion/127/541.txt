In France every effort was made to obtain drawings of the French field artillery without success. Since our return to England we have succeeded in obtaining tracings of the gun carriage and limber, which we inclose,* believing that with very slight modifications they will be useful in manufacturing carriages for the 12-pounder purchased. We have not been able to obtain drawings of the caissons, but with what is sent it is believed but few difficulties will arise in constructing them. The field guns were purchased the day before the receipt of the news of the victory at Manassas. Had we deferred the matter one day it is probable we would have decided to reserve the money for other purposes. The ranges corresponding to elevation, from one degree to seven degrees, inclusive, are inclosed. * The pieces are very superior.

It may not be improper to mention that the news of the Manassas victory was received in Liverpool on Sunday morning, 3d of August. As soon as it came to our notice, and several hours before it was generally known, we drove to the residence of Mr. Prioleau, about four miles from the town, where we knew there was a Confederate flag. Mr. Prioleau was absent at the time of our arrival, but we had no difficulty in obtaining permission to enter the house and raise the flag, and we believe that we thus had the honor of being the first to celebrate our triumph on this side of the Atlantic by hoisting the flag of the new republic. In connection with this subject we have it from reliable authority that the British Admiralty have sent out Confederate flags to be distributed to each of their vessels of war on the North American station.

We have to acknowledge the receipt of a communication from Mr. Charles Green, of Savannah, Ga., associating him with us in the duties upon which we are now engaged. It will afford us much pleasure to co-operate with Mr. Green, as we know him to be a merchant of great practical ability, and one who can be of material service to us in the civil details of our engagements. He is now in London on a brief visit.

In clothing this report it will be sufficient to say that heretofore the Northern Government have up to the present time had the control of the market under the circumstances detailed in the commencement of this letter. We are now, however, on a par with them, and if kept supplied with means will reserve their position by holding the same advantage over them which they enjoyed over us in the beginning. Having looked carefully over all the arms within our reach, we have abstained altogether from the purchase of the old worn-our muskets that have been so greedily both up by the Northern agents. They are the merest rubbish in the world, very far inferior to the old George Law muskets, and will surely prove more dangerous to those who may venture to use them than to the troops against whom they are pointed. Our purchases have been confined thus far to the Enfield rifle. They have been selected with great care, and we feel assured will give confidence to any soldiers in whose hands they are placed. Our contracts will be coming in rapidly form this time forward, and in the course of the next few weeks we shall have accumulated sufficient supplies to warrant another shipment greater in extent than the one now being made. It may become necessary, in view of the difficulty of obtaining vessels, to unite with Mr. J. D. Bulloch in the purchase
