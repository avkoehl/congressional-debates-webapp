sidering the past unless you take the matter in hand and give our minds the right direction. I think that it would be well, if it can be so arranged, to relieve Pickett's division from the trenches by some of the troops from the Valley, as his is one of our most reliable divisions-it would probably be of more use operating against any move upon our flank than a like number of the troops from the Valley; it would also be in reserve for the center of our lines if needed there.

I remain, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,December 21, 1864.

Major General J. B. KERSHAW,

Commanding Division:

The reining two brigades of Hoke's division will go off before daylight to-morrow morning. You will move the rest of your command down to Hoke's line to relieve them this evening, so as to give Hoke's men time to prepare for their journey and prevent any delay in getting off to-morrow morning. You will please order a guard of eleven men and a non-commissioned officer to report to General Longstreet's quarters (at Mr. Randolph's house, on Osborne road) to-day, to relieve a guard there from Hoke's division.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

General Field will relieve Clingman's brigade on Hoke's extreme left this evening, so as to assist you in covering the front recently occupied by Hoke. You will dispose your division along the rest of Hoke's line. General Longstreet desires you to have all the pits in your front arranged after the manner of those on that part of the line recently occupied by Kirkland's brigade.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,December 21, 1864.

Major General C. W. FIELD,

Commanding Division:

You will relieve Clingman's brigade, of Hoke's division (on Hoke's left, on the Darbytown road), this evening, so as to enable that brigade to get ready to go off before daylight to-morrow morning. You can do this either by moving the whole of your command to the right far enough to throw one brigade across the Darbytown road or by moving your left brigade over to your right and across the Darbytown road. This latter move would appear more advisable, as it would cause but one brigade to change quarters. General Longstreet wishes you to have all the pits on your line arranged in a similar manner to those on that part of the line recently occupied by General Kirkland's brigade.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
