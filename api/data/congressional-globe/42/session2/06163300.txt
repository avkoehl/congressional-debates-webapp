THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 10,
Mr. BURCHARD. I move to amend by
inserting after line twenty, section one, the
words "on iron in pigs, six dollars per ton."
We have reduced the duty on tea and coffee,
making them free, reducing them to the con-
dition they were in before the war. We have
reduced the duty on coal from $1 25 to seventy
five cents per ton. We have reduced the duty
on salt from fifty-six and fifty per cent, down
to one half of what those duties were. Now I
propose that we reduce the duty on pig iron
and other forms of iron.
Mr. KELLEY. 1 wish to interrupt the
gentleman before we proceed to the consider-
ation of section two. I gave notice yesterday
that 1 had several other amendments to offer
to section one.
. Mr. BURCHARD. My amendment is pro-
posed to section one, and I beg the gentleman
not to take up my time. There seems to life
to be no more favorable time for the reduction
of the duty upon iron than the present. It is
the imperative duty of Congress to reduce it.
The price of iron abroad is now twenty-five
to thirty per cent, higher than it was a year
ago. In this country the wholesale price of
bar iron has gone from sixty to seventy dollars
a ton up to one hundered dollars a ton. That
increased price has resulted from three causes
that are, to some extent, permanent. One is
the increased demand for the consumption of
iron abroad on the continent of Europe, to
repair the waste of war ; another is the increase
in wages paid on the continent for labor; the
third is the inflation, to some extent, of the
currency, the circulating medium in that coun-
try. By the release of money that was locked
up in France, millions upon millions have
been thrown into circulation in Germany, and
much of it has gone abroad to England. The
demand in Germany to supply the wastes of
war hai sent much of this increase of circula-
tion abroad, and it has increased the price of
labor on the continent. Those three causes
have created an advance in the price of iron,
us well as all other goods in foreign markets,
so that now, if pig iron was made free, the
manufacturers of this country would receive a
greater prolk than they have received for a
long series of years. Hence 1 say that we
ought now to reduce the duty on iron.
Tim last House while in Committee of the
Whole voted to reduce the duly on pig iron to
live dollars a ton. ( call attention of gentle-
men to the action of that House on this sub-
ject when in Committee of the Whole upon
tho tariff. The following rates were adopted
on some of the loading classes of iron:
"On iton in pis-:, flvo dollars per ton. _
"On cust .scrap iron of every description, fivo dol-
lars per ton ; on wrought, scrap iron of every descrip-
tion, six dollars per Ion : 1'roridcd, That nothing
shall i>o deemed scrap iron cxeopt waste or refuse
material that has hrou in actual use, and is tit only
to l)e reiuaiiufaotured.
"On ii on bars, rolled or hammered, (comprising fiat
bar--,) not loss than ono ami a half, nor more than four
inches wide, nor less than halfnn inch, nor more
tha,n two indies think, twenty dollars per ton.
"On iron bar**, rolled or hammered, (comprising; flat
bars,) less than one and a half inches, or more than
four inchcs wide, and les. than one half and not less
than t hreo eighths of an inch thick, and on iron bars,
roiled or hammered, more than two inohes thick,
$22 40 per ton.
"On railroad iron mado to pattern, and fitted to be
Jaid down, sixty ccnts per one hundred pounds.
" On iron ot any size or description, net otherwise
provided for, one cent-per pouint: Provided, That
iron, in any form or description, charged with aduty
'■under this act shall not bo changed from its classi-
fication because of any partial or complete manu-
facture into any article not designated, unless it
(ghall bo a part of some finished manulacture, com-
'poMed in chief part ot other metal, or of winch other
metal shall be a component part ot chief value."
There can be, so far as I can see, no more
favorable titns lor this reduction than the
present, and it is the imperative duty of Con-
gress to make it.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. RANDALL. I rise to a point of order.
Mr. BURCHARD. I hope the Chair will
not deduct from my time that which was con-
sumed by interruptions.
The CEIAIRMAN. The gentleman from
Pennsylvania rises to a point of order.
Mr. RANDALL. My point of order is that
we are now in Committee of the Whole under
instructions from the House. The House
when it referred this bill to the Committee of
the Whole referred it with instructions, and a
part of those instructions was to reduce the
duty on pig iron ten per cent. This amend-
ment is not in accordance with the instructions
of the House.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair overrules
the point of order. The instructions referred
to by the gentleman were given to the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means. The bill reported
under those instructions was referred to the
Committeeof the Whole forsuch amendments
and alterations as that committee might see
fit to make.
The committee rose informally and the
Speaker resumed the chair.
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE.
A message from the Senate, by Mr. Symp-
son, one of its clerks, announced that the
Senate had rejected a bill of the House of the
following title:
A bill (H. R. No. 1050) for the removal of
the legal and political disabilities imposed by
the third section of the fourteenth article* of
amendment to the Constitution of the United
States.
The message further announced that the
Senate had passed, without amendment, a bill
of the House of the following title:
A bill (H. R. No. 2082) authorizing the
construction of a public building at Fall River,
State of Massachusetts.
The message also announced that the Sen-
ate had passed with an amendment, in which the
concurrence of the House was requested, a bill
of the House of the following title:
A bill (H. It. No. 2016) authorizing the
erection of a public building in Rockland,
Maine.
The message further announced that the
Senate had passed and requested the concur-
rence of the House in a bill of the following
title:
A bill (S. No. 1002) to change the name of
the schooner La Pette to La Petite.
TAtltJfl? ANl) TAXES.
The Committee of the Whole resumed its
session.
Mr. BROOKS, of New Yoik, obtained the
floor, and yielded to Mr. Buiiohakd.
Mr. PACKER. 1 rise to another point, of
order. My point of order is that in another
portion of this bill there is a provision made
for the duty upon pig iron; and this is an
attempt to introduce that subject as an amend-
ment to a different part of the bill from that
in which the original proposition was con-
tained. The amendment, will be germane to
that portion of the bill when reached.
Mr. STEVENSON. I rise to a point of
order.
Mr. DICKEY. There cannot be two points
of order pending at the same time.
Mr. STEVENSON._ Well, 1 suggest that
the point of order raised by the gentleman
from Pennsylvania [Mr. Paokeh] comes too
late after we have discussed the amendment.
The CHAIRMAN. If the point of order
had been made in time, the Chair would have
sustained it.
Mr. PACKER. I understand the question
on ihe amendment has not been decided.
Mr. DICKEY. It has not been.
Mr. DICKEY. Then, is not the point of
order in time?
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair overrules the
point of order at this stage.
Mr. BANKS. When can the point be made?
There must be some proper time for members
to present questions of order.
The CHAIRMAN. Thispointwas notraised
till after tii© amendment had been discussed.
According to the uniform ruling a point of
order on an amendment must be made imme-
diately after it has been read by the Clerk.
Mr. BURCHARD. Mr. Chairman, I desire
to call attention to the price of pig iron in
New York from 1856 to 1860. I take these
figures from a report on finance, page 36, aa
given in Senate document, first session Thirty-
Sixth Congress, volume five. By this report
it appears that the prices of pig iron for the
years indicated were as follows :
1855-5 6 _$26 96
1856-5 7  26 68
1857-5 8  22 78
1858-5 9  25 10
Now the price is from forty-five to fifty
dollars a ton. Look at the difference : twenty-
five dollars in 1858; forty-five dollars at least
in 1872. What enormous profit to owners of
the ore beds and to the manufacturers.
The gentleman from New York, [Mr. E. H.
Roberts,] my colleague on the Committee of
Ways and Means, referred the other day to
the dividends and profits made by the manu-
facturers of iron. I had the day before stated
to the committee that these enormous bounties
secured by the tariff laws, though claimed to
be for the benefit of labor, went really to the
manufacturers. The gentleman from New
York produced the next day a table exhibiting
the dividends of manufacturing companies
from 1820 to the present time. He proves my
assertion. The table shows that under the
compromise tariff of 1832 the profits of man-
ufacturing were at that time thirteen per cent.,
and diminished as rates of duties diminished
under that tariff, till in 1842 they were but.
three per cent. During the period from 1843
to 1849, under the high tariff of 1842, these
dividends averaged thirteen and a half per
cent. Under the tariff of 1846 they averaged
six per cent. Under the tariff of 1857 they
were a little higher, on account of the infla-
tion of the currency, but since 1862 they have
averaged twelve and three eighths per cent.
The table in detail is as follows:

is condensed from Martin's Tables of Manufacturing
Dividends, a work of undoubted authenticity:
