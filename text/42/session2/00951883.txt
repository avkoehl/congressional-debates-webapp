Mr. HAMILTON, of Texas, from the Com-
mittee on Pensions, to whom was referred the

Mr. BOREMAN. Senate bill No. 2G0, for
the relief of loyal citizens of Loudoun county,
Virginia, therein named, was referred to the
Committee on Claims, together with a petition
of those citizens, asking for pay for two classes
of claims : first, for property destroyed by the
Army of the United States ; secondly, for prop-
erty taken and used by the Army of the United
States. I am instructed by the committee to
report back favorably the bill that was referred
to them to pay for the property destroyed, and
to recommend its passage. I do not concur
in this report myself: first, because I think it
of doubtful propriety at this time to begin to
pay this class ot claims; and second, because
it seems to me to be in opposition to the policy
incorporated in the act creating the southern
claims commission.
i am further instructed by the same com-
mittee to report a second bill to pay for the
other class of claims referred to in the peti-
tion, which is for property taken and used by
the Army. I concur with the committee in
reporting in favor ot the passage of that bill,
and 1 submit a report, which 1 desire to have
printed, setting forth the facts.
The bill (S. No. 850) providing for the pay-
ment of loyal citizens of Loudoun county,
Virginia, therein named, for their property
taken by the military authorities of the United
States, was read and passed to the second
reading, and the report was ordered to be
printed.
Mr. CRAG IN. The Committee on Naval
Affaiis, to whom was referred a letter of the
Secretary of the Navy, communicating a report
of the board of officers organized to examine
the eases of such officers as may have deemed
themselves unjustly passed over by promotions
made in conformity with the act ot Congress
approved July 25. 1860, have had the same
under consideration, and instructed me to
report a bill carrying out the recommendations
of the board. As the bill is very short, I am
instructed by the committee to ask for its pres-
ent consideration ; and I will state as a reason
that if there is much delay some of the officers
will go oil the retired list.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senatorfrom
Illinois has had unanimous consent to call up

soldiers' homesteads.
Mr. DAVIS, of West Virginia. I have a
petition from sundry citizens of Harper's
Ferry, which I ask to have read, and then I
shall ask to have the bill to which it relates
considered.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Illinois has obtained unanimous consent
to call up the bill in regard to homesteads of
discharged soldiers.
Mr. POMEROY. We cannot give unani-
mous consent to more than one bill at a time.
Mr. DAVIS, of West Virginia. I withdraw
the request.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
further morning business, the bill (S. No. 447)
to enable honorably discharged soldiers and
sailors, their widows and orphan children, to
acquire homesteads on the public lands of the
U nited States, is before the Senate as in Com-
mittee of the Whole.
The Committee on Public Lands reported
the bill with amendments.
The first amendment of the committee was
in line thirty of section one, after " aforesaid,"
to insert " shall be deducted from the time
heretofore required to perfect title,'' and after
line thirty-four to add "without reference to
the length of time he may have served so
that the proviso will read;
And provided also, Thattho time which thohome-
stead sottler shall have served in the Army, Navy,
or Marine corps aforesaid shall bo deducted from
the time heretofore required to perfect title, or, if
discharged on account of wounds received, or dis-
ability incurred m the line of duty, then thotermof
enlistment shall be deducted lrom the time liereto-
iore required to peifect title, without refercnco to
the length of time he may have served.
The next amendment of the committee was
to add as an additional section the following:
Sec. 5. That any soldier, sailor, marine, officer, or
other person coming within the provisions of this
act may, as well by an agent as in person, enter upon
fc.iid homestead: Provided, That said claimant in
person shall, within the tune prescribed, eommcnoe
settlement and improvements on the same, and
thereafter fulfill all the requirements of this act.
The amendments weie agreed to.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I do not know
that I have any objection to the bill, but it is
impossible to undei stand in how many particu-
lars it may affect the homestead law. I hope
the honorable Senator who has charge of it
will give some explanation as to the particu-
lars in which it affects the homestead law, and
to what extent.
Mr. LOGAN. The homestead law, as the
Senator is aware, applies to all persons, lliis
bill provides that where persons had taken
homesteads, had in the language of the law
entered a homestead and left that homestead
and gone into the Army and served, so that
the homestead has been forfeited on that ac-
count, or sold, or taken possession of by the
Government, the soldier shall be permitted to
reenter and his time is to be counted.
The main change in the homestead law is
this: that instead of the man who served in
the Army being required to reside on his
homestead five years, as the law now is, he
is permitted to enter, for which the law gives
six months, and alter that six months he is
required to reside one year and cultivate the
homestead for one year, and then the time that
he served in the Army is deducted from the
five years; that is to say, if he served four
years in the Army, one }rear's cultivation will
give him the homestead ; it he served two, it
would require three ; if he serves three, it will
require two. The change is in deducting the
time he served as a soldier from the five years
which the law now requires.
This bill is recommended by the Commis-
sioner of the General Land Office, as I undei â€¢
stand, and with the amendments lie pro-
posed it is reported unanimously by the Com-
mittee on Public Lands after full and thorough
consideration. I see no other respect m which
it does affect the homestead law. I he rest is
merely detail as to how it shall be carried out.
There is one other provision, however, which
perhaps 1 ought to explain. That is that an
