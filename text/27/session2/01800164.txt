whether the gentleman from Massachusetts was in order in dis-
cussing the Question of slavery or mm slavery, and he insisted
upon a decisión  to see whether this House would disgrace it-
self.
The SPEAKER said that, m his judgment, this whole mattei
was out of order; butmasmuch as this same point had just been
^ made, aofl the decision of the Chair had been oveuuled, he
could not now arrest the debate
Mr. ADAMS said he had not got to the sweetest part of the
letter yet
Mr RAYNER appealed from the decision of the Chair
Mr HOLMES moved that the House adjourn, which motion
was decided in the negative.
Mr WISE asked to be excused from voting on this question,
and stated as his reason that he could not decide whether the
remarks of the geu'lemaa from Massachusetts were relevant or
irrelevant He could not judge whethei theyweie pertinent to
the petition, which was not in possession of the House
Some conversation arose as to this fact between the
SPEAKER and Mr. WISE, when the motion was carried, and
Mr Wise was excused from voting.
The yeas and nays were asked and oideved upon the appeal,
and the call having commenced, inquines were made by seve
ral gentlemen as to the precise nature of the decision of ihe
Speaker, coacemmg which, in the confusion that pre vailed, af-
ferent opinions had been formed
Mr. RAYNER then reduced his point of older to wtitmg,
which was read by the Clerk, and was, substantially, that the
gentVeman from Massachusetts [Mr Adams] .vas out of ordei
m discussing the quesaon of slavery or non slavery, la the
reading, by leave ot the Hou^e, a paper purporting o be a let
ter from the gentleman from Virginia, |,Mr Wish ]
Further conversation arose as to the precise appeal first ta
ken
After which, the call of the yeas and nays having been com
pleted, the vole resulted thus—yeas 66, nays S9
So the decision of the Chair was reversed
Mr aDaMS then said he presumed he would be permitted,
under the previous decision of the House, t > proceed in the
reading of the ¡etter
Mr. HOPKINS objected to the gentleman from Massachu-
setts proceeding one inch, and hoped his objection would be no
taced.
Mr LINN moved that the House adjourn.
The vote on which motion was taken by tellers, and resulted
—ayes 86, noes 57
And then, at half past four o'clock, the House adjourned
IN SENATE.

hoped it would receive the favorable consideration of the Senate
He adverted tothe extra session, a period of four months, and
thought if the duration of the present session was fixed at the
time designated, (which would allow us foui months,) that
there would be ample time foi action on all the great leading
subjects before them.

made from eommi'tees but the confusion was so great in the

Tjnited State3 the speech pio<"eederl to bay
"The first and, in my opinion, the mo3timportantobject
which shouid engage the serious attertion of a new A dm mis
tration, is tnat of cucuiuscribm? the Executive power, and
throwing around it such limitations and safeguard  as will
render í no longer dangerous to the public liberties
"Whatever is the work of man necessarily partakes ofhia
imperfections, and it was not to be expected that, wuh all the
acknowledged wisdom and virtues of the framers of our Con-
stitution, they could have sent forth a plan of Government, so
free from all defect, and so full of guarantees, that it should
not, in the conflict of embit ered parties and of excited passions,
bepeiverted and misinterpreted Misconceptions orerroneous
constructions of the powers gi anted in the Constitution would
probably have occurred, aftei the lapse of many yeais, in sea*
sons of entire calm, and with a íeguiar and temperate admrms- t
tration of the Government, but, during the last twelve years,
the machine, driven by a reckless chanoteer wuh frightful im
petuosity, has been greatly jarred and jolted, and it needs care-
ful examination and a thorough repair
( With the view,theiefoie,to the fundamental character of the
Government itself, andesoecially of the Executive branch, it
seems to me that, eithei by amendments of the Constitution,
when they'are necessary, or by remedial legislation, when the
object iaMs within the scope of the powers of Congress, there
hould be—
"1st A provisun to ver-der a person ineligible to the office of
President of the United States after a service of one term Much
observation and delibeiate reflection have satisfied me that too
much of the time the thoughts, and the exertions of the incum-
bent, are occupied, during hi  fiist term, in securing his re-
election Tne public bu==me&s consequently, sufleis, and mea-
suies are ptoposed t *■ executed wi h less regard to the general
pio^neiity than tothn i influent eupon the appioachingelection.
In the limitation to oneteim sxi^ted the Prei>ident would beex-
ciusively devoted to the dr-chaue tf his public duties, an J he
would endeavor to signalize his administration by the benefi-
cence and wisdom of its measures
l2& That the veto powei should be moie precisely de-
fined, and be subjec eü to Ju ther limitations and qualifica-
tions "
Thus it would be pei %eived by the Senate lhat, whatever
tiuth oi soundness there might be m the opinion ft hich he had
embodied m the le oiution no\r =ul mitted to the Senate, it waa
an opinion long since deliberate y formed and expressed, and
on© which had often since been considered and reviewed, un-
prompted by any of thoee i ecent occm rences to which it might
otherwise have been supposed to owe its origin
The paiucular amendment now before the Senate for its
consideration and to which, he should speak before he more
bnefly adveited to the otheis which accompanied it, waa that
which i elated to the veto power And while on this subject of
redeeming the pledge which wa , in so^ e sort, given by him as
one of the humblest membeis oi that party which had not leng
eirce so signally triumph d he hoped the Senate would allow
him, in ail truihand sincerity, to say that he de&ired to see a
j avty, when it ca le into power, redeem the pledges and fulfil
the promises it made when out of pownr, ^nd not exhibit that
di grateful spectacle so often vsii nested in the political history
of other natiors, of profe sirg one set of pnrciples and em-
ploying them as in eanstowaru> gluing in o powei, and then,
when successful m obtaining the.i wishes turn round, forget all
they had -aid and promised, and go on to admimstei the Govern-
ment justas then predecessors had done He conldasaure
