The Tariff—Mr. Roberts.
42d Cong....2d Sess.
Notice, first of all, that the imports in 1866
exceeded the total exports of British colonial
and foreign produce, exclusive of bullion, by
£33,323,801, or $161,287,196. This adverse
balance has been constant, and has been
generally increasing. In 1870 it was £59,161,-
344, or $286,340,905 in gold, about £1 18s.,
that is $9 16 per capita.
THE WORLD SELLS TO BRITAIN BUT BUYS ELSEWHERE.
Analyze the statement closely. Scrutinize
how under the British policy the excess of
imports over exports steadily runs up. Weigh
the fact' that imports into Britain grew in
fourteen years by the vast sum of £130,751,-
928, or $632,839,331. In the same interval
British exports increased only £104,914,388,
or $507,695,623. The excess in growth of im-
ports above that of exports has been in this
period £25,837,543. or $125,143,708 in gold.
This increase of disparity is nearly one fourth
of the total imports of merchandise into the
United States in 1871. British imports exceed
British exports by an amount six times greater
than the excess of American imports over
American exports. Mr. Wells's alarm comes
from a deficiency on our part of $1 71 per
capita. The British deficiency is $16 26 per
capita. By so much, according to his test, is
Britain a better market than the United States
"to sell foreign produce in," and by so much
"the very poorest market to buy from."
Gentlemen who deny our prosperity, mag-
nify the triumphs of the British policy, and
the glories of British commerce. An adverse
balance of trade is not greatly to be feared
when it is caused, as with us in good part, by
the influx of foreign capital coming iu to seek
investment and develop our resources.
Against the appeals of these disciples of
British political economy to adopt their
theories, I confront these records of I he conn-
try which they hold up to us for example.
The tendency of the world, let it be noted, is
to sell to Britain for money, and to buy else-
where. In 1870, Britain bought of foreign
produce $47 58 for every person of its popu-
lation, and sold of British produce only $31 32
per head. The adverse difference was $16 26
per head; while our total imports in 1871 were
only $13 68 per head.
BULLION.
It is fair to state that the shipments of bul-
lion correct in part the great disparity which
is shown and which is growing. But the
adjustment is far from complete, and an exam-
ination of all the figures justifies alarm and
apprehension as to the future of British trade
and commerce. The imports and exports of
bullion are as follows:
Imports. Exports.
1858 £29,493,190 £19,628,876
1862  31,656,476 29,326,191

BRITISH EXPERIENCE NOT DESIRABLE.
If W3 accept the warning which Mr. Welles
and his disciples derive from our commercial
record, what shall we say to the lessons of the
British figures? Our financial policy may
need reform, but surely the British policy
does not point the way. Our foreign trade
may be dangerous, but by the same test British
cemaerce is a bubble ready to burst. We
want to produce more on our own soil;
Britain can teach us only how year by year to
buy more and more abroad. The balance of
trade is now against us.' Apostles of pretended
fiee trade point to a commercial millennium,
and we find it a vortex of adverse balances, a
geometrical progression of that which, in our
case, they style ruin. We may wel! avoid the
path into which they ask us to enter.
Our great need i3 increasing production
on the soil. The earth is oars and the full-
ness thereof. Our work is out of our mines
to conjure treasure; out of our soil to pro-
dace crops; to forge our metals with skill-
ful hands; to weave cloths from co'.ton and
from wool: to fashion wares from all the gifts
of prodigal nature. In all departments we
are gaining rapidly on our great rival. I do
not care to say even in borrowed phrase of
Britain—
"The little island is already overcrowded, and is
unable to produce enough either of food or of cloth-
ing to supply the populace which swarms upon it. Its
supplies must be drawn largely from foreign coun-
tries, and it is needless to say that the United States
has long been its principal depot for provisions."
For I recognizc the continued growth of
Britain, and rejoice in it. But her relative
advancement in manufactures must hereafter
be less than our own. I do not join in the
lugubrious prophesies that her fuel will fail
and her shops grow idle. But the fact is cer-
tain that the rate of increase in her great pro-
ducts has of late fallen off. Time will permit
the citation of only a few leading examples.
The production of coal and pig iron for recent
years has been as follows, according to figures
given by the (British) Staiesman's Year-Book
for 1872 :
Year. Coal, tons. Pia,™>
1858   65,008,649 3,456,064
186 2  81,633.338 3,943,469
1865  98,150,587 4,819,254
186(5   101,630.534 4,523,987
186 7 104,530,480 4,761,023
186 8   103,141,157 4.970,206
186 9 —.107.427,557 5,445,757
1870*  - 5,960.000
1871 *    - 6,400,000
The increase of coal was, from 1858 to 1864,
twenty-seven per cent., or nearly seven per
cent, a year; while from 1864 to 1869 it was
ten per cent., or nearly two per cent a year.
The increase in pig iron was, from 1858 to
1864, nearly forty per cent., or six and six
tenths per cent, a year; while from 1864 to
1869 it was less than fifteen per cent., or less
than three per cent, a year. American rail-
road building has during the past two years
given unnatural impetus to British iron man-
ufacture. Our railway bonds are readily ac-
cepted in payment and create a demand to
which British furnaces and mills are inade-
quate. This forced production doeS not over-
throw the logic of the figures for a decade.
The iron crown will soon be wrested from
Britain.
In other metallic productions such a positive
decrease is shown:

1858 £1,562,693 £1,489,005 £823,480
186 3  1,409,608 1,418,985 1,170,702
1867  831,761 1,337,509 799,203
1869  664,063 1,397,415 1,201,456
5 These years are gathered from other authority.
The trade in these metals is decreasing in
Britain year by year. Does any one say that
the loss in rate of increase, and even the retro-
grade in metallic productions is compensated
by the growth of the manufactures of cotton
and woolen? Here are the figures to answer
the suggestion:

1870  2,483 38.218,758 441,276
The increase in spindles from 18-50 to 1861
was nearly fifty per cent., and of power looms
nearly twenty pttr cent. From 1861 to 1870
the increase of spindles was only thirty-one
per cent., and of power looms only eleven
per cent.

The increase in spindles from 1850 to 1861
was thirty-seven per cent., and of power looms
was neaily one hundred and thirty-three per
cent. From 1861 to 1870 the spindles in-
creased by nineteen per cent, only, and ihe
power looms by one hundred and twenty-one
per cent.
