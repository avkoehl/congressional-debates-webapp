I don not see, therefore, why you should be surprised at the withdrawal of Gibbon, though I must admit Hancock should have withdrawn him last. You can refuse your right flank, but the left must remain in connection with Warren. You should endeavor to get a reserve of movable troops to meet any attempt to turn your right flank. The Totopotomoy ought to be a strong line to rest your flank on.
