COLUMBUS, OHIO, July 6, 1864.

(Received 9. 20 a. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Major Reaney, General Cox's provost- marshal, reports that he has returned from a scout in Kentucky, and the citizens expect General Morgan to return soon. There are rumors to the same effect in the newspapers. I do not know what forces are threatening Covington and Newport, where they are, nor when to expect an attack. The fortifications are insufficiently garrisoned to be held even against a small force.

S. P. HEINTZELMAN,

Major- General.
