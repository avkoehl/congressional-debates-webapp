I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

LOUIS HEBERT,

Brigadier-General.

Major S. CROOM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS HEBERT'S BRIGADE,July 1, 1863.

MAJOR": I have the honor report that about 1. 30 p. m. the enemy sprang another and a larger mine under the main redan of the work on the left of the Jackson road, this time destroying the parapet of the redan. Our interior work is uninjured. The enemy attempted no immediate charge after the blast, but opened a brisk artillery fire. The change occasioned exposes a portion of our troops heretofore protected, and there is necessity of immediate work, both to strengthen our interior line and give more protection to exposed points. Lieutenant Blessing, assistant engineer on this portion of the line, was wounded a few hours since I. Earnestly ask that some other officer be immediately sent to replace him.

I am, major, respectfully, your obedient servant,

LOUIS HEBERT,

Brigadier-General.

Major. S. CROOM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS DIVISION,July 1, 1863.

Respectfully forwarded for the information of the lieutenant-general, and with the request that an engineer officer be detailed at once in the place of Lieutenant Blessing.

JNumber H. FORNEY,

Major-General.
