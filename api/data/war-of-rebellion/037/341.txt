I cannot give any idea of the ordnance stores lost, because I have none of the reports of returns. During the siege the commanders of garrisons had nothing to do with the ordnance stores further than to see that hey were taken care of. Ammunition &amp;c. Was sept to the batteries and removed from them without our knowledge. Colonel Higgins and all his staff are absent, and I get no better information than given above.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. BELTZHOOVER,

Lieutenant-Colonel First Louisiana Artillery.

R. R. HUTCHINSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
