NEAR WEYER'S CAVE, June 17, 1862.

General W. H. WHITING:

GENERAL: If your troops are in camp please let them remain there, and if marching please put them in camp as soon as practicable, and give like orders to other troops near you, and let me see you at my headquarters upon important business.

Your most obedient servant,

T. J. JACKSON,

Major-General.

NEAR WEYER'S CAVE, June 17, 1862.

Colonel T. T. MUNFFORD,

Commanding Cavalry, Valley District:

COLONEL: The arms you spoke of sending have not yet been received. Did you send them here or to Staunton? It is important that you picket from the Blue Ridge to the Shennandoah Mountain or to the mountain west of Harrisonburg.

Until further orders send your dispatches to Brigadier General C. S. Winder, near Weyer's Cave.

Do all you can to cut off communication across the lines between us and the enemy. Also let there be as little communication as practicable between your command and that of our infantry. Let your couriers be men whom you can trust, and caution them against carrying news forward, as it may thereby reach the enemy.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. J. JACKSON,

Major-General.

NEAR WEYER'S CAVE, June 17, 1862.

Colonel T. T. MUNFORD,

Commanding Cavalry, Valley District:

COLONEL: I congratulate you upon the success of yesterday. Send the prisoners to Staunton, and also the captured property, if you can spare it. If you have need of it, let it be accounted for to Major J. A. Harman by your quartermaster as captured property, and as such taken up on his return.

If you can meet me in Staunton by 5 o'clock to-morrow morning I hope you will do so, as I desire to have a personal interview with you. Instead of sending your dispatches to General Winder please continue to send them directed to me.

Your most obedient servant,

T. J. JACKSON,

Major-General.

P. S.-I do not wish you to leave your command unless you can safely do so. I will be at Mount Sidney to-night about 10 o'clock. Can you meet me there? I will be on my horse at north end of the town, so you need no inquire after me. I do not desire it to be known that i am absent from this point.

T. J. J.
