HARRISBURG. [April -.]

Major PORTER,

Capitol:

You will oblige me by detailing one company to guard our bridges between this and Parkton. I am fearful from the information I am now receiving that an attempt may be made to destroy them to-night.

You should hasten the departure of the troops from here.

Yours,

J. D. CAMERON,

Vice-President.

[APRIL 22, 1861-p. m.]

General WYNKOOP:

Where are you going with your command?

PORTER.

APRIL 23 - a. m.

[Major PORTER:]

Ordered from Maryland by order of General Scott and Secretary of War. You have my order.

WYNKOOP.

General W.:

Can you camp all your men at the Junction?

PORTER.

[Major PORTER:]

Have nothing but unground coffee, rice and bee. No supper last night, and nothing for the men this morning.

[WYNKOOP.]

Major PORTER:

I cannot get the coffee made. There are only four or five dwellings here. It would require 300 gallons to give each man a pint. They have changed camp this morning to the woods on account of shade and better water. A regular officer was clearly wanted last night; too much confusion. Several accidents resulted from the want of order- one death.

J. C. CLARKE.

General W.:

I will send meals if you will secure the bridges and road and fiw your camp, and maintain your post at all hazards.

PORTER.

Major PORTER:

No ground is suitable for the command to encamp here. At York there is good ground. Will obey any command the Government gives me. Think it would be best to stop at York, and not here.

[WYNKOOP.]
