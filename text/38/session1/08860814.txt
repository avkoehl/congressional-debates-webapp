THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 25,
Mr. McDOUCrALL asked, and by unanimous
Consent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S.No.
135) to amend an act entitled "An act to aid in
the construction of a railroad and telegraph line
from the Missouri liver to the Pacific ocean, and
to secure to the Government the use of the same
for postal, military, and other purposes," passed
july l, 1862; which was read twice by its title,
and referred to the Committee on the Pacific Rail-
road.
INTERNAL REVENUE.
Mr. FESSENDEN. There is upon the table
a message from the House of Represen (atives ask-
ing for a second committee of conference on the
internal revenue bill. I think it would be well
enough to take up that matter and dispose of it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will pre-
sent to the Senate the message from the House of
Representatives referred to by the Senator.
The Secretary read the message, which an-
nounced that th^ House of Representatives had
non-concurred in the report of the committee of
conference on the disagreeing votes of the two
Houses on the bill (H. R. No. 132) to increase
the internal revenue, and for other purposes; had
further insisted on their disagreement to the amend-
ments of the Senate; had asked for a second con-
ference on thedisagreeing votes of the two Houses;
and had appointed Mr.'E.B.washborne of Illi-
nois, Mr. J. A. Kasson of Iowa, and Mr. J. L.
Dawson of Pennsylvania munagers at the sec-
ond conference on the part of the House of Rep-
resentatives.
Mr. FESSENDEN. 1 hardly know, Mr. Pres-
ident, what is the proper motion to make to ac-
complish the object which I have in view; but it
has occurred to me that a motion that the Senate
recede from its vote adopting the report of the
committee of conference, and agree to the further
conference requested by the House of Represent-
atives, wilt be in order.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senate may
further insist, or may simply agree to the confer-
ence asked for by the other House.
Mr. FESSENDEN. My query was whether
it was necessary for the Senate to recede from its
vote adopting the report of the first committee of
conference. Thatreport was adopted by the Sen-
ate, went to the House of Representatives, and
was there disagreed to. It occurred to me that it
might be proper for us to recede from that vote.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator pro-
poses to recede from the former vote of the Senate,
and to agree to the second conference.
Mr. FESSENDEN. My motion is that the
Senate recede from the former vote accepting the
report of the first committee of conference, and
agree to the second conference asked for by the
House of Representatives,
The VICE PRESIDENT. The impression of
the Chair is that that should be the form of the
motion. The question is, "Will the Senate recede
from its former vote agreeing to the report of the
first committee of conference, and agree to the
second conference proposed by the House of Rep-
resentatives ?"
Mr. HALE. " Reconsider," not " recede."
Mr. FESSENDEN. Perhaps "reconsider"
would be tlie proper term.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It means the same
thing. *
Mr#FESSENDEN. I suppose so.
The motion was agreed to; and by unanimous
consent (lie Chair was authorized to appoint the
committee; and Mr. Shf.kman, Mr. Clark, and
Mr. Hendricks were appointed.
I.AND GRANT TO A MINNESOTA KAII.KOAD.
Mr. RAMSEY. I move that the Senate post-
pone all prior orders and proceed to the consid-
eration of the hill (S. No. 31) making1 a grant of
lands to the Lake Superior and Mississippi Rail-
road Company in the State of Minnesota to aid
m the construction of the railroad of said com-
pany from St. Paul to Lake Superior.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate pro-
ceeded to consider the bill.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. Iaslony honorable friend
from Minnesota to allow the hill to go over. My
colleague [Mr. Howe] is not here, and he and I
have not had an opportunity to confer in relation
to this bill. There were some remonstrances pre-
sented to the Senate on the subject, but they did
not go to the committee until after the committee
had reported the bill. I hope he will consent to
let it lie over. He can call it up at an early day.
Mr. RAMSEY. Had we not better give it-one
reading at this time?
Mr. DOOL1TTLE. It has already had two
readings. It was read twice before it was re-
ferred.
Mr. RAMSEY. I propose to offer an amend-
ment to it.
Mr. WILSON. On the suggestion of the Senator
from Wisconsin I move to postpone the further
consideration of this and all other matters in or-
der to take up the joint resolution to equalize the
pay of soldiers in the United States Army.
Mr. RAMSEY. Before that motion is enter-
tained I should like to submit an amendment to
the bill.
Mr. WILSON. Very well.
Mr. RAMSEY. I offer an amendment to the
bill, which I desire to have printed. Itis to strike
out in the thirteenth line of the first section all after
the word " Minnesota, "andto insert what I send
to the Chair.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator's
amendment will be received, and it will be in order
after the amendments reported from the Commit-
tee on Public Lands shall have been first acted
upon. Those amendments will be first in order.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. If the bill is to go over
I should like to have that amendment printed.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The order to print
will be made.
Mr. WILKINSON. 1 see that the colleague
of the Senator from Wisconsin is now in the
Chamber.
Mr. RAMSEY. As the Senator's colleague is
now present, probably there will be no objection
to proceeding with the bill. I think it will take
but a fow minutes to dispose of it.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I will state to the Senator
from Minnesota that I have not had an opportu-
nity to consult with my colleague about this bill.
It concerns railroads within our State. There
have been some remonstrances sent in here on the
subject which did not reach the committee in time,
and were not considered, as I understand.
Mr. RAMSEY. If the bill is to be postponed
I hope the Senator will consent to have it "come
up at an early day.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I prefer that it should go
over until we can have a consultation about it.
Mr. RAMSEY. I shall not object to that.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will be
passed over.
acting assistant paymasters.
Mr, HALE. As the morning houris notcon-
cluded, and there aie one or two bills reported
from the Committee on Naval Affairs which have
been neglected hitherto, I hope the Senator from
Massachusetts will allow them to be taken up. I
move to take up for consideration Senate bill No.
108.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Does the Senator
from Massachusetts waive his motion?
Mr. WILSON. Yes, sir; i will waive it until
one o'clock, when 1 believe the joint resolution I
have indicated will come up as the unfinished
business.
The motion of Mr. Hale was agreed to; and
the Senate, as in Committee of the Whole, pro-
ceeded to consider the bill (S. No. 108) relating
to acting assistant pay masters in the Navy, which
was repoited from the Committee on Naval Af-
fairs, with an amendment to strike out all of the
original bill after the enacting clause, in the fol-
lowing words:
That any acting assistant paymaster now in the volun-
teer naval service, who shall have performed his official
duty with diligence and fidelity, may be transferred to the
regular naval service as assistant paymaster therein, after
undergoing an examination by a hoard of naval examiners
and fouud to be qualified for said office: Provided, The aye
of such acting assistant pa} master shall not exceed thirty
j ears.
And to insert in lieu thereof:
That whenever the PiPsidont of the United States shall
nominate any acting assistant paymaster in the volunteer
naval set vice, on account of his'faithful, diligent, and ef-
ficient dischaige of dutv in the volunteer service, to be an
assistant payma&tei in the Navy, it shall be no objection to
his appointment and confirmation that he is over twenty-
six y^aisof age: Piovvlctl, Thnthc be notoverthirty yeais
of age: Jlnd provided further, That the nuinbei of pay-
masters and assistant paymasteis as authorized by law be
not mci eased thereby.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. DIXON. With the consent of the chair-
man of the Committee on Naval Affairs, I will
offer an amendment to this bill. If he objects to
it I shall not press it; but 1 think it might very
well be added to this bill. Itis to insert as a new
section:
Jlnd be it further enacted, That tlie students of the Naval
Academy designated for examination for admission thereto
shall be between the ages of fourteen and eighteen years.
Mr. GRIMES. I suggest to the Senator from
Connecticut to amend his amendment so as to
strike out the words " designated for examina-
tion," and to insert "when examined." They
may be designated three or six months before
they are examined.
Mr. DIXON. I agree to that.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The amendment
will be so modified.
Mr. HALE. In regard to this amendment of
the Senator from Connecticut, I have not the
slightest objection to it in the world, only that
it does not seem exactly congruous to the bill.
However, I have no objection to it.
Mr. DIXON. It seems to me there can be no
objection to it from any quarter.
Mr. JOHNSON. There is no objection to it.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate as amended,
and theamendments were concurred in. The bill
was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading,
was read the third time, and passed.
Mr. HALE. The title should be amended by
adding " and for other purposes."
Mr. JOHNSON. I think we had better alter
the title so as to show what the amendment is.
The last amendment related to midshipmen in the
Naval Academy, I think.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The title will be
amended so as to read, A bill relating to acting as-
sistant paymasters in the Navy, and regulating the
appointment of cadets in the Naval Academy.
paymasters' clerks.
Mr. HALE. 1 now move that the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of Senate bill No. 104,
also reported from the Committee on Naval Af-
fairs.
The motion was agreed to; and the bill (S. No.
104) to regulate the pay of clerks to paymasters
in the Navy was read a second time and consid-
ered as in Committee of the Whole. It directs
that the annual pay of clerks to paymasters in
the Navy shall be as follows: Clerks to paymas-
ters at each navy-yard, excepting Mare island,
$1,200; at Mare island, $1,500. Clerks to in-
spectors of provisions and clothing at Boston,
New York, Philadelphia, and Cairo, $1,200; at
other inspections, §1,000. Clerks to paymasters
or assistant paymasters of receiving snips at Bos-
ton, New York,Philadelphia, and Cairo, $1,200;
of other receiving ships, and in store vessels,
$1,000. Clerks to paymasters or assistant pay-
masters in vessels having complements of five hun-
dred and over, $1,000. In vessels having com-
plements of three hundred and over, and less than
live hundred, $800; in other vessels, $700; but no
paymaster orassistantpaymasteris to be allowed
a cletk in vessels having complements of lessthan
one hundred persons, exceptingin supply steam-
ers and storeships.
Mr. HALE. This is a bill raising salaries,
which I generally oppose. I will not say a word
about it, but will simply ask that the report of the
committee on this subject may be read to the
Senate.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It will be read.
The Secretary read the following report:
The Committee on Naval Affairs, to whom was referred
the petition of John F. Den&on, paymaster's cleik in the
Navy, piayifig anmcrease of the compensation of paymas-
ters' clerks in the Navy, have had the same under consid-
eration, and report:
That, having addiessed a communication on the subject
to the Secretaiy ot tlie Navy, the following reply has been
received:

questing the views of this Department touching the subject
of the petition.
In reply theieto; I lespectfully submit heiewith a report
of this date, from the chiefof the Bureau of Provisions and
Clothing, to whom I refened the subject, and who has
