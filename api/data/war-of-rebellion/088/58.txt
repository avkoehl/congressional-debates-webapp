HEADQUARTERS FOURTH DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 5, 1864.

Major General G. K. WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Army Corps:

SIR: I have reason to know that should you consolidate the corps as suggested, and form the old First into a division, that General Ayres would not be unwilling but pleased to be its commander, provided the order was made without consulting him. He would not seek for it. I think the troops would all be willing to serve under him; they might not be under some other one. As there is little doing now, could it not be done as well now as at any time, if at all? So far as I am concerned, I would prefer to have it done now that at a later period, provided I could bring about the arrangement which has been suggested in our conversations. I might get rid of a little toasting in this hot sun.

Very respectfully,

L. CUTLER,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,August 5, 1864. (Received 9 a. m.)

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report the ordinary state of affairs on my line. Abatis was put down and the work strengthened in other ways. The night was unusually quiet as regards firing.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,Before Petersburg, Va., August 5, 1864.

General SETH WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to submit, for the information of the general commanding, the following statement in regard to the mine: The main gallery is uninjured clear up to the tamping, which extends back thirty-five feet from the end of the gallery. Side galleries could be started from a point twenty-five feet this side of the tamping, running off diagonally to the enemy's works on either side of the old crater. If the commanding general desires to make use of mining in connection with the operations of the army against Petersburg, this work could be done in a few days.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General, Commanding.
