Send me the papers about Hooker to-night, and make specific recommendations to fill the vacancies. Make Hooker resign his post as commander of the Twentieth Corps, that he cannon claim it and occasion delay in filling the vacancy.

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: Inclosed herewith I have the honor to transmit a copy of a communication this day received from Major-General Hooker, with my order in the case.

Stanley, commanding First Division of the Fourth Army Corps, be placed in command of the corps. Major-General Hooker having, at his own request, been relieved from the command of the Twentieth Army Corps, I would recommend that Major General H. W. Slocum be placed in command of that corps.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE:

SIR: I have just learned that Major-General Howard, my junior, has been assigned to the command of the Army of the Tennessee. If this is that case I request that I may be relieved from duty with this army. Justice and self-respect alike require my removal from an army in which rank and service are ignored. I should like to have my personal staff relieved with me.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.
