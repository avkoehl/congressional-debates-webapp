HANCOCK'S HOUSE, May 31, 1864 - 9 a. m.

General B. BRAGG:

Our demonstration of yesterday afternoon showed works of enemy in our front still occupied by infantry and artillery, also some troops in reserve. All quiet at present.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

HANCOCK'S HOUSE, May 31, 1864 - 10 a. m.

General B. BRAGG:

General Dearing reports that he had driven in the enemy's pickets at Gatlin's, and that he is endeavoring to sink two of their gun-boats. He reports that the enemy has a very small force at that point.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

HANCOCK'S HOUSE, May 31, 1864 - 11.45 a. m.

General B. BRAGG:

General Gracie has just reported as follows:

A deserter, a sergeant from Seventh New Hampshire Regiment, Hawley's brigade, Terry's division, Gillmore's corps, reports Smith's corps on transports, leaving for Grant's army. Enemy have erected six large forts along their lines, in which they have mounted heavy guns; also have two large forts in their rear.

If this should prove correct this would still leave here in my front 10,000 or 12,000 men.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

HANCOCK'S HOUSE, May 31, 1864 - 12.20 p. m.

BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS,

Camp on the lines, May 31, 1864 - 1.30 p. m.

Major General D. H. HILL:

GENERAL: I am just in receipt of your note of to-day respecting the order of General Bragg to General Whiting, commanding him, on the 15th instant, to proceed to Richmond without delay with all the available forces at Petersburg, and saying that the defense of that city was not as vital as that of the metropolis. My letter to Captain Otey, assistant adjutant-general, was in reply to an official communication from him in the words and figures following, to wit:
HDQRS. DEPT. OF NORTH CAROLINA AND SOUTHERN VIRGINIA,May 29, 1864.

GENERAL: I am instructed by the commanding general to inquire of you whether while you were in command of the First Military District you received any order to evacuate the city of Petersburg? If so, you will please send these headquarters a copy of the same. If you haven't the order with you, you will please state where it can be found.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. M. OTEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
