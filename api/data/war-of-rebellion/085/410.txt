PILOT KNOB, September 27, 1864.

Major-General SMITH:

I think the regiment from Mineral Point had better be sent here to-night. The rumor is that the enemy are evidently in very strong force, and the fort is large enough to hold advantageously the increased garrison. If it be deemed inadvisable to re-enforce them advise me explicitly whether to fight it out or leave. I don't believe they can whip me readily the first day, for it will take them long to get their artillery in commanding position, but the delay of a day may result in cutting off my means of exit. I do not understand General Rosecrans' order to evacuate in case the strong probability is that Price is there as being addressed to me but to you, and therefore I await orders. If you conclude to re-enforce order train by which I send this message as far as Irondale on the Mineral Point to bring the troops, unless the freight train with Potosi engine is still there, in which case advise operator at Irondale of the fact when the trail will return here.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.

(Same to General Rosecrans.)

PILOT KNOB, September 27, 1864.

Major-General SMITH:

Your dispatch received showing your presence at Mineral Point and that you have ordered additional troops there are all right. I send up to get out of the way 50,000 rations and a large number of quartermaster's stores. Retain what you want. Inform me if there is anything in the way of the train going up in the next hour. I think there are more men at Irondale than can be used effectively in the blockhouse at South Big River bridge, which is a full mile north of Irondale. There are about 200 at the town and 60 at the bridge. If you want those at Irondale to go to block-house, you might telegraph there to have telegraph office there closed or moved to the bridge, and the surplus men go upon the train I am about sending form here. I propose to keep the passenger train if you don't need it; all the rest I send saving a few platform cars. Advise me of dispositions made.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
