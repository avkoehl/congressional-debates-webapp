penitentiary, and now the gentleman wanted to add
disqualification from office Was it likely, he
asked, thu a man who shall be imprisoned in the
penitentiary will ever bs appointed to an oflice
under the Government of the United States? It
did appear to him that the additional penally pro-
posed would be rendering the bill somewhat ludi-
crous
Mr NILES spoke somewhat at length in defence
of his amendment, contending that, as the punish
ment had been lessened by the amendment just
passed, an additional penalty was necessary, and
that the penalty he proposed w ould most probably
be inflicted even if the other was not Mr N
could not agree with his friend from Arkansas,
[Mr. Sfvier,] that this bill was for the piotection
of members of Congress, only Jt had a much
higher object in view—that of suppressing an
odious and criminal practice, and of securing the
perfect independence of the representatives of the
people. His friend from Arkansas seemed to be
ambitious of martyrdom, and wanted to be shot at
Now, he would have no objection to mtioducmg an
amendment to exempt his fucnd from the operation
of the bill, but he was anxious that it should pass
for the benefit of those who had no wish, like him,
to run against the mu7zle of a gun
Mr N made some fuuhei íemarks in reply to
Ml PRFSTOr , and, alter some lemaiks from the
lattei,
The question w as taken on Mi Nil rs's amend-
ment, and it «as lost—ayes 14, nays 17, as follows

Kentucky, Clayton, Pulton, Merrick, Mouton,
Nicholas, Norvell, Pieston, Roane, Robinson,
Ruggles, Sevier, Smith of Indiana, Strange, Tip-
ton, and White—17
Mr SMITH of Indiana offered an amendment,
making the surgeons witnesses, providing they
shall not have advised the challenge, and exempt
ing them from punishment
Mr NORVELL oppised the amendment, on
the ground that it would pievent surgeons fiom
being engaged at all—tnus.breaking up i custom
which humanity had originated
Aftersome lemarks (run Messis SMITH (1
Indiana and PRENTISS, the foimer withdrew his
amendment, as he pciceived that it wjuld embar
rass the bill
Mi SMITH of Indiana then offered an amend
ment, authorising magistiates when they havi suf-
ficient reason to believe that a duel is about to be
fought, to issue their warrants to bring the parties
before them, when they aie further auihori/ed to
compel them to give bond and security to keep the
peace for one year, and m default thereof, to com
rmt them to jail
Mr CLAYTON opposed this amendment as
contrary to one of the fundamental principles ol
law, and contiary also to the Constitution of the
United States, which provides that no warrant shpll
issue but upon probable cau e, supported by oath
er affirmation This amendment, he contended
would put every man in the District in the power
of any magistrate who might affect to believe that
he wis about to fight a duel
After some remarks fiom Mr SMITH of In-
diana in support of the amendment, it was rejected
Mr WHITE then moved to amend the bill by
striking out all after the enacting clause, and in-
serting a substitute providing that every perscn
who shall hereafter be appointed to office shall, m
addition to the usual qualification, take an oath
that he has not, s nee the parage of tins act, been
directlv or indirectly concerned ma duel Mr W

dy, Hubbard, Lumpkin, Lyon, Merrick, Mouton,
Niles, Pierce, Prentiss, Smith of Connecticut,
Smith of Indiana, Swift, Trotter, Williams, Wiight,
and Young—19
The question then coming up on concurring
with the amendments made in Committee of the
Whole,
Mr CLAY of Alabama asked that the question
be taken on the thud amendment separately. Pie
was opposed to this amendment, because it went
beyond the Distnct of Columbia into the adjoining
States.
The question was then taken onconcuinng with
the third amendment, and it was lost—yeas 15,
nays 16, as follows
YEAS—Messrs Davis,Grundy, Hubbard, Lump-
kin, Merrick, Niles, Pierce, Prentiss, Smith of Con-
