THE RECENT ORDERS TO PREVENT THE EVASION OF MILITARY DUTY.

These orders are designed to operate on two classes of persons, viz, those who contemplate leaving the United States for the purpose of evading their military duty, and those who leave their own State or place of residence and go into other States for the same purpose. The object is to compel every citizen of the United States subject to military duty to bear his share in supporting the Government. Instructions have been prepared, and will be issued on Monday, to military commandants, marshals, and police officers respecting the mode of executing the orders so as to interfere as little as possible with individual pursuits and business, and limit the operation of the order to cases of evasion*
