GENERAL: I have the honor herewith to submit to you a report of the operations of my command from August 15 to September 5, 1862, embracing the several engagements of Manassas Junction, Bristoe Station, Ox Hill, and so much of the battle of Groveton (on August 28, 29, and 30) as was fought by the troops under my command:

On August 15, in obedience to instructions from the commanding general, I left my encampment, near Gordonsville, and, passing Orange Court-House, encamped in the evening near Mout Pisgah Church, where I remained until the 20th, when, in accordance with my instructions, while General Longstreet was crossing the Rapidan at Raccoon Ford, I crossed the same river at Somerville Ford. The command encamped for the night near Stevensburg.

My command at this time comprised Ewell's, A. P. Hill's, and Jackson's divisions. Ewell's was composed of the brigades of Generals Lawton, Early, Hays (Colonel Forno commanding), and Trimble, with the batteries of William D. Brown, [W. F.] Dement, [J. W.] Latimer, [W. L.] Balthis, and [L. E.] D'Aquin. A. P. Hill's division was composed of the brigade of Generals Branch, Gregg, Field, Pender, Archer, and Colonel Thomas, with the batteries of [C. M.] Braxton, [H. G.] Latham, [W. G.] Crenshaw, [D. G.] McIntosh, [Greenlee] Davidson, and [W. J.] Pegram. Jackson's division, commanded by Brigadier General William b. Taliaferro, was composed of Winder's brigade, Colonel Baylor commanding; Colonel Campbell's brigade, Major John Seddon commanding; Brigadier General William b. Taliaferro's brigade, Colonel A. G. Taliaferro commanding, and Starke's brigade, with the batteries of Brockenbrough, [George W.] Wooding, [W. T.] Poague, [Joseph] Carpenter, [W. H.] Caskie, and [Charles I.] Raine.

Major-General Stuart, with his cavalry, co-operated during the expedition, and I shall more than once have to acknowledge my obligations for the valuable and efficient aid which he rendered.
