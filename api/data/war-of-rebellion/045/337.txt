Brigadier-General WILLIAMS,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

The general has gone on to Middlestown, where he has one brigade, and directs me to inform you that his headquarters to-night will be at that place. Our forces occupy Crampton's Pass, patrolling thoroughly in all directions, but without meeting any force of the enemy. We also hold South Pass [Turner's], and have heard of no enemy in that direction. So far as the general has been able to ascertain, there is no force of the enemy in the neighborhood of any of the gaps, nor do they appear to have any intention of coming this side. Our supply train is still detained at Edwards Ferry, suffering for feed, and our men are put of rations.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. BALDWIN, JR.,

Major, and Assistant Adjutant-General.
