loud rejoicing at the humbled and prostrate condi-
tion of your Tteasury'! Have we not been given
to understand, by the avowed friends of the Ame-
rican system, that Ihey ran and do perceive the re-
vival of the principles of that system m the rejec-
tion of this bilP Have you not heard that the fi-
nancial measures of this administration had ex-
ploded, and upon its rams would be erected a new
bystem, against which my colleague and myself
have been equally opposed? Is there not enough
m the signs of the times to deter my colleague from
ptnsuing any course that may again give pretext
to any poition of the representatives of this Union
to increase the tariff? Sir, upon no principle con-
sistent with the elevated stand the South should
occupy on (his floor, can we justify the rejec-
tion oí the bill on youl table I deeply regret
that my colleague should have thought it his
duty to have discussed this question on the ground
oí preserving the "rights and equality of his con-
stituents " Sir, who is opposed to the rights of
their constituents? That isnot the question It is,
how can  e best protect their rights1 My col-
league s plan would be to pay tl em the fourth m-
stilment m the (unds of the banks of Alabama,
¡V ississippi,Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana, on which
they would loose fiom fifteen to thirty per cent as
he well knows that ihe paper of the banks of those
Stales is not current in Geoigia, and if used at
all, must be converted into other funds through a
broker But this is not all the people uould be
required to return thriverv money in sppcie Sure-
ly my colleague would not desire to bless h -> con-
stituents with a cahmity so ereat'
Mr Speakei, when my colleague endeavoied,by
his argument, to show that all the people ol Geor-
gia requued was money, regardless oí consequen-
ces, or the principles involved in their receiving it,
I must confess I felt humbled, and that the tiue
spmtof the people I represent in pait had been
unfair y stated to the House and to the nation Mo,
sir, it is not money that ve want, vie desire a lree
Government—a Government admimst red upon
pr nciples securing every man in every por-
tion of this Union in the enjoyment of his
property and the fruits of his industry No,
sir, my colleague has underrated our consti-
tuents, by placing this question on ground 
too nanow Sir, a more high minded, generous, and
patriotic people than tho'e represented by the gen-
tleman and my self in part, do not breath When
in their histoiy, and to what period of their ckis-
t nee, was it ever know that they sat down upon
the selfish and sordid calculation ol dollars and
cents, when the public welfare was involved? Go
back, sir, to the remotest period, and let my col-
league tell when great constitutional and legal
pnnciples were involved on thp one side, they
ever looked to the petty, wretched, pitiful conside-
ration of money on the other Sir, I will not dis-
honor their high and exalted claim to patriotism,
secured by an uninterrupted course of public mea-
sures, and political principles, by addiessmg an
argimentto feelings which I have yet to learn
they possess No, sir, as my colleage hasmpposed
on his return to his ce nstituents, he will be asked
to give his íeasons (or the vote he may give
on this question, I ask him to tell, what is
now placed beyond doubt, that so far from
there be ng a surphis in the Treasuiy to de-
posite wuh the States, that there is an actual
deficit of several mi'lions, that so far from the
Government being able to make the fumh depo-
site, we art compelled to issue Treasury notes to
meet the current expenses of the Government
that if we do not withhold the fourth instalment,
we \v 11 be compelled to bonow three or four mil-
lions to enable the Secretary of the Tieasury to
cairy into eiFect the law , and after telling them
this, he mav say, that so far as Georg a is con-
cerned the best he could do was to get Alabama,
Mississippi, Indiana and Ohio paper, andaboxe
all, let him tell them, that if he votes against the
bill, he admits, by that vote, that a power exists
m this Government to tax the people to raise a
surplus to be distributed among the States for works
of internal improvement' Let my colleague tell
this, and I am not afraid to meet the judgment that
may be ptonounced upon the vote I give, by my
constituents "With no expectation of addressing
the House to-day, I have, Mr Speaker, m a desul-
tory manner, attempted an answer to the argument
of my colleague, and, sir, m conclusion, if my
counsel could prevail, I would beg him to re-
examine the whole question, and renounce at once
the errors into which he has fallen
REMARKS OF MR. TITUS,
Of Npw   York,
iii the House of Representatives, Tuesday, October 10,
18 >7—On the bill from   the  Senate postponing
the payment of duties en revenue bonds
Mr TITUS said he had hoped that some of the
honoiable mombers of this House, whose charac-
ter and talents would have given weight to their
opinions, would have thought ptoper to address the
House upon the bill befoie it He was aware that
views similar to his own were entertained by v>ry
many upon this floor, but the disposition geneially
manifested, seemed to render hope ess any opposi-
tion to the amendment oTered by the honorable
chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means
Viewing it, however, as he did, and in the absence
of any discussion, he felt it to be his duty to give
verv briefly his objections to the consideiation of
the House
The first section of the bill grants an extens on
m the time of payment on all revenue bonds of
nine mi nth' To that he had no objection The
condition oí the limes unquestionably lequ res it,
on the ground that it will rendei the payment ulti-
mately moie ceitam, and it may moreover lend, in
s ane degree, to relieve those immediately con
nected wi'h the importing interest Still it ap-
pealed o him, that the only just and tenable ground
upon which an extension could be grained, was
the additional safety attained by that ex tens on
But neither the second section of the bill nor the
amendment offered, can be entertained upon the
principle of increased security, or of relief to any
portte n of the community, except the merchants
There i no indebtedness to the Government that
the amendment proposes to secure, on the contrarj,
it releases in the¡ e days of non-payment, from the
custody of the Government, the merchandise held in
security for cash duties, and proposes the substitu-
tion ot a lengthened credit upon bonds, subject ol
aourst ti 'he contingencies of the times
He was opposed to this portion of the bill, as
well in regard to its practical effect, as to its vto-
laHng a settled principle of existing laws He
took it for granted that the laws in relation to reve-
nue were proper and just, they had been a subject
of exciting in erest and profound discussion during
a long period, and were finally settled in the spirit
of compromise amid the ecnvuKions of the nation
Were they to be lightly disturbed? Weielheyto
be approached without great and apparent causes?
However unimportant m that point of view the
piesent propos tion might appeal to the House, it
acied forcibly upon his mind It was well known
to this Hon e and to the nation, that at tne last
session of Congiess, the Committee of Wajs and
Means w ith its present chairman at its head, intro
due d a bill to reduce iht duties en imports It
bote in ihat character too urif-tvoiable an aspect to
meetsnppott andwasaband ned
The subj ct is now appiinched with more cau-
tion, an! we are only presented with tl e fir t st-p
by which ihe ladder is to be in< tinted, another is
about ben g intiiduced, which, if accepted, will
scatter to the winds whatevei of protection, il pio-
tec ion it can be c tiled, that tne producing classes
now ¡ecerve
The pre position, then, being to that effect it is
desinble that the Committee of Ways and Means
should approach the subject dnectl), that they
shoul I toe the mark, and introduce a bill entitled
an act to repeal the d Hies on imports Its object
would then be understood, and the honoiable mem-
bers ol this house would act advisedly.
The practical operation of this bill will be to
increase, and throw into market, the airead) exces-
sive importations of goods, paying, by existing
laws, cash du its      The means obtained tj  the
bounty of Government, will furnish forth new im-
portations, and none can act with such deleterious
offect upon the labor and interests of the producing
classes, as those of this character, and an acqui-
escence in the demand of the commercial interest,
will fall with peculiar hardship upon that extensive
class of ihe people They suffer not only m com-
mon with all other classes of the commuuity, but
by the provisions of this bill, they, in efleGt, are
required to furnish forlh the means to enable the
importers, by further unnecessary importations,
still more to injure and depiess them.
Gentlemen are aware that merchandise paying
cash duties, as embraced in this bill, consist  of
wool, woollen goods, and goods of which wool is a
component part We have been told in this hall,
that our manuiactoiies are generally suspended in
their business, that thousands ol our citizens con-
nected with them are cut ol employment, and aie
in a condition of want and suffering, and it is well
known by ihooe conversant in such matters, that the
puce of goods of ihis description is depressed be-
yond all iorraer pretedent The quantity on hand
of this kin 1 of good , f reign and domestic, is im-
mense, and the amount of wool in the warehouses,
and remaining vet in the hands of the producers,
seattered over the noithein half of the Union, can
not bt less m value than tw enty millions of dollars
Does not this state of things ethibit embarrass-
ment and distress to an extent that does not requne
legislative enactments to increase n? Shall the
commanl—he believed the lerm was not mappio-
priate—oí the commercial interest aeld to the gene
raí calamity, by screening themselves fiom the
effects of their own impiuelence, anil throwing it
with apj ailing tuce upon tliegreit mass oí the
pioducing classes, whom that imprudence has
already so severely injured' It is tiue, that those
(lasses aie not asking for relief, they disdain to pre
ler the mendicant's praver, but, in the language of
the honorable gentleman IromOhio, they pull oft
then coals, roll up their sleeves, and go to woik.
He had said that the? distresses of the people
were principally caused by the imprudence of tie
commercial interest It was generally conceded
that they had proceeded mainly from over trading,
but, to his mind, a proper distinction had not been
taken as regards the kind or character cf over-
trading So far as the individual concerned is
affected, no distiction exists, but it must be borne
m mind hat, however se\ere the íevulsions id.
business may.at any time be among a great peo-
ple, a vast majority of individuals are not mate-
rialtv affected by it—a vast mijority do not incur
liabilities that create embarrassment Hence,
v lien the balance of trade is not against us wuh
foreign nations, om immense domestic opertttons
are not impeded, arid, a'ihough in their excesses
mdn iduals w ill suffer, cipital is not dneried fiom
its accust me 1 channels, it meiely changes hanes
within a circle over which it is not required to
pass A brief view of oui own condition will
establish lhat position Our domestic operation",
including current business and general indebted
elnes , reach to an amount ofwhieh it is difficult
even to form an opinion We ha\e no data to
direct us but what is der ved fnm our knowledge
of mdebtiess to banks, but he thought he was
moie likely to be below than aboie the mark in
placing it it two thousand milhe ns per annum
This immense business had at a'l times been
tran acted without difficulty, when balances abroad
had not piessect too hard upon us No revul-
sion  under such circumstances had taken place,
and all the effirts to that end that were made by
politicians and others, m 1854, were abomve
No eforts could have been mors animated, nor
means more powerful applied, to create confusien
and produce disas er, but the energy and resource
of the people, not being crippled by loieign de-
nt inds—the pa> ment ofwhieh required the basis of
oui paper cnirencv, bore tro tr umphantly and suc-
cessful!} against the stoim In illustration of this
i lew of the subject, he wou'd adduce a remark ol
an Fnghsh statesman in comparing the relative
condition of England and the United States m the
presen' crisis He said that the former, with a
