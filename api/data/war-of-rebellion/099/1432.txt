moved up the Raleigh road as far as Stewart's Creek and put some mills to work. The Fourteenth turned to the right and crossed Black River at a point nearly east of Averasborough. The Fifteenth and Seventeenth Corps are on the right of the Fourteenth, and, I hear, have crossed Black River. Kilpatrick's cavalry is, I think, with the Fourteenth Corps. I am certain it was near that corps yesterday. I have pickets on the Raleigh road, and no move has been reported on that road this morning. I shall soon hear which way the Twentieth Corps moved after reaching Stewart's Creek. Some of my scouts, who were in Fayetteville day before yesterday, report that all of the enemy had crossed Cape Fear River and had taken up their pontoon bridge. Some of my men escaped from Fourteenth Corps last night after dark and report that corps did not go into camp until about 10 o'clock. They think Sherman's army is marching toward Goldsborough and not toward Raleigh. The cavalry in front of Fifteenth and Seventeenth Corps is, at present, reporting direct to General Hampton and not to me.

With highest regards, your obedient servant,

J. WHEELER,

Major-General.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I have just heard from General Allen, who is in front of the Fourteenth Corps on the new road leading to Smithfield, which runs nearly parallel with this road and is three or four miles south of it. He reports the enemy advancing upon him this morning. He captured prisoners from both Fourteenth and Twentieth Corps. This far no advance reported ont his or the Raleigh road.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,Averasborough and Smithfield Road, March 18, 1865 - 11. 30 a. m.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Commanding Department, &c.:

GENERAL: Scouts juts in report that portion of the Twentieth Corps which moved up to Stewart's Creek on the Raleigh road have returned to Averasborough. I presume it will turn off and cross Black River at the same point the Fourteenth Corps crossed it. By crossing at that point they can go either to Smithfield or Goldsborough.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

J. WHEELER,

Major-General.
