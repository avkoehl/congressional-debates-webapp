that tne pasvage of th s bi 1 will be estaba htng a

wh ch I ove to myself, my country, and my God,
to ta' e care thn no act ot mine shall stand record-
e ', as exoressmg my will, when I believe violates
the Cons nut on. It 1 not rretended that thisclaim

ihe Giveinmeni, bjt, so far from hs fr ends set-
ting un a v 3 ¡st claim for ths enormous «um of
§25,000 th y .sppea' to our sympa hies, and urge
tne expenses of the last e ec loseenrg campaign,
and his expensen at endant upon his removal to the
city of Washington, as the f undationof the elaim.
In fact, so far as I hive been  b'e to trace the gen-
tlemen in argument, I h.ve been umble to gather
a s n e s0] nry f c wh'ch consbtutes either
a Kgal or cqu uble claim upon this Govern-
ment Tne/ say he had to pay a large post-
age bill, that he was kind to all who
ceiled up n biT>, ard that his door was
alu^ys open to hd his guests a welcome to his
hospitalities, but, «ir, are th 'e good reasons
why we bould hes'o v ution his widow and heirs
the sum cf §25 003 to pay tne expenses incur-
red by *i a it pou-mg out bis bounty, and
feed ig the s va^m <f hup¿r', office seekers who
thr nged aoOJ' h m to effect t eir po'itical pro-
jee? Wh', had ne died before the election, or
had he been defea ed in that po ideal canvass, thn
claim would never have been heard or thou£ht of.
It hi ,m fact nri'her lav/, equity, or jistice on its
side, bp 1 cannot be granted except m direct viola-
ton of the Cons itu 1 n It he hrs any legal or
equitable c'aim against Government let h s friends
bnrg it forwiid, and I wiU go as far any other to
see tnat it is a lowei, imd libeMll}, too, to the last
ee t It requires no special lew to en lt'e his heirs
to receive .41 h^wasentit ed to as President There
is no pretence ihv th •> b 1! is introduced tor that
purpose, for what, then, 1 ' m  ash1! Why, (the

hiswdowand h-rstn  sam of $2j 000 8 r, if
we pass tus bill, w 1 it not te upon th* principle

Will it tint be taking the sum of $25 000 eut of
