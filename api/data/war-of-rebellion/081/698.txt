likely to get, to survive a similar disaster. We have yet about eight miles of track to repair at and west of Staunton, and ten bridges to rebuild. We do not propose to repair west of Staunton at present. I have requested the editors of the city papers not to notice the re-opening of the road.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Respectfully returned to the Adjutant and Inspector General.

I do not think there was any danger to the road from small raiding parties, at least none that could not be met by the reserve force, which I have previously recommended should be placed at the bridges. I also advised that the cavalry company, under Captain Anderson, in Hanover, should be used for the same purpose. They could give information of the approach of the enemy. Now that the enemy's cavalry is in force on the north side of James River the roads are exposed to attack. That can only be met by our cavalry, which has been ordered to that side of the James. A permanent guard for the bridges cannot be furnished from this army. File.

R. E. LEE,

General.
