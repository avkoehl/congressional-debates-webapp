HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA, Goldsborough, March 7, 1862.

General S. COOPER,Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, va.:

GENERAL: I find that I neglected to acknowledge the receipt of a telegraphic order from the Secretary of War, dated the 2nd instant, directing that the troops be withdrawn from the defenses of Washington and sent immediately to report to General Randolph at Suffolk, Va., &amp;c. I sent the order to Brigadier-General Branch on the 3rd instant, with instructions to carry into effect immediately. It is being done, and the artillery will be sent up to Tarborough to be placed on the railroad for future disposition.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. GATLIN,

Brigadier-General.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA, Goldsborough, March 7, 1862.

Major General J. G. MARTIN,Adjutant-General of North Carolina, Raleigh:

GENEAL: In compliance with the requisition of His Excellency, Governor Clark, as expressed in your telegram of yesterday, I have ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Hoke, with three companies of the Thirty-third Regiment North Carolina Troops, to report to him at Raleigh. You are aware that these troops are required at New Berne, and I earnestly beg that they may be sent back as soon as their places can be supplied in the district in which the Governor wishes them to operate. Indeed, I hope you have already obtained the necessary force elsewhere and that you will send them back from Raleigh. Nothing less than a convinction of their absolute necessity in the disaffected district ought to have dictated the requisition. Certainly nothing less than a coninction on my part of the pressing necessity would have induced me to reduece the force at New Berne one man.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. GATLIN,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General MARTIN,Adjutant-General of North Carolina:

GENERAL: I have just received your dispatch. As Colonel Hoke's command is without tents and there appearing to be no immediate necessity for their services west, I have ordered them to return to New Berne. I expect to go to New Berne this afternoon, and will be absent from this place for several days.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. GATLIN,

Brigadier-General.
