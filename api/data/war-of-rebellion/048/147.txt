Brigadier-General BOYLE,

Louisville:

Please ascertain and report to me immediately:

1. How many men can be transported by employing the whole rolling stock of the road from Louisville to Nashville, enumerating the number of cars of every description that could be employed?

2. How many hours it usually takes to make the trip from Nashville to Louisville, and at what rate of speed?

3. Is the road from Nashville to Chattanooga the same gauge as the road from Louisville to Nashville, so that cars can go direct from Louisville to Chattanooga, and what time does it take from Nashville to Chattanooga?

4. If the gauge of the roads is different, what is the supply of rolling stock on the Louisville [Nashville?] and Chattanooga road?

Please answer if you have positively determined to make any immediate movement. If not, prepare the Eleventh and Twelfth Corps to be sent to Washington, as soon as cars can be sent to you. The troops should have five days' cooked provisions. Cars will probably be there by the morning of the 25th.

The Twelfth Corps is in the front on picket, and could not well be withdrawn and got ready in the time you name.
