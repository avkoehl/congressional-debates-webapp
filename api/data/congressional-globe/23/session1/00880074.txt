THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Jan. 2,
CHAMBERS, and EWING participated, when
it was laid upon the table—yeas 22, nays 16
The VICE PRESIDENT presented a commu
nication from the Secretary of the Navy, which
was read and ¡aid on the table
REMOVAL OF PUBLIC DEPOSITES.
The Senate resumed the consideration of the
resolutions submitted by Mr Clay on the 26 h
ultimo
The VICE PRESIDENT observed, that before
the discussion was commenced, the Chan would
take occasion to state that any expressions of
their opinions or feelings by spectators in the Sen-
ate Chambei, in regard to anything said in debate,
were inconsistent withtheorder oí the Senate, and
could, on no account, be tolerated Under the
hope that the officers of the House might have it
in their power, by the "use of ordinary means, to
suppress any such acts, and being indisposed to
confound the many respectable citizens who are
obviously desirous of preserving the decoium
demanded by their situation, with the few who
are forgetful or unmindful of their duty in this
regard, the Chair had hitherto forborne to direct
the galleries to be cleared upon the exhibition
of such ímpiopiieties The experience of the
last few days, however, clearly indicated thatsuch
feelings could not be indulged with safety to the
order of the Senate, and has induced the Chair
to state that there must be perfect silence and
order observed on the part of the spectatois, and
that if this admonition was in the least degree dis
legarded, the Chair would feel it to be a duty to
take effectual measures to put a stop to the irregu-
laiity by directing the galleries to be immediately
cleaied
Mr BENTON said he would takeleave, before
he took up the sublet under debate, to vindicate
an offlcei of the Senate who had been unjustly
assailed, and who had not the right of epeaku g
ior himself He alluded to the Secietary of the
Senate, [Mr Lowne,] and to the threat publicly
expiessed in open debate bya Senator from K>n
tucky [Mr Clay] to move to expel him fiom Ins
office if he should remove any of his clerks for
their political opinions The thieat implied a
know ledge or belief that the Secretary intended to
make such removals, when in point of fact no such
intention existed The Secretaiy now had every
clerk in his office which was in it when he came
in many years ago He was living in the utmost
harmony with these clerks, and could not but feel
himself deeply wounded by a thieat which raised
En implication which had no manner of existence
Mr B sud that an acqinmtanceof fourteen yeais
with the Secretary enabled him to say that he wis
incapable of the dishonoiable conduct attributed,
by implication,to him, that he was a high exem-
plification of the character of a Cln istian and a gen-
tleman, and would conscientiously discharge his
duties to the Senate and his clerks without the
slightest regard to unmerited threats Mr B also
spoke of the animadversion which had been made
at the same time, and for the same cause, upon an
officer of another body, [the Clerk of the House
of Representatives ] Mr B was a stranger to
him, knew nothing of what he had done, had no
opinions to Kive as to his conduct, but he would
say, m vindication of the privileges ot the House
of Representatives, that the conduct of their Cleik
belonged to them, not to the Senate, and that it
was unpaihamentary for the Senate to take notice
of it
Mr B then proceeded to the ordei of the day,
the resolutions submitted by a Senator from Ken
tucky, [Mr Clay,] on the removal of the public
deposites fiom the Bank of the United States, and
asked for the reading of the resolutions.
The Secretary reads—
1, " Resolved, That by dismissing the late Secre-
tary of the Treasury, because he would not, con-
trary to his sense of his own duty, remove the
money of the United States in deposite with the
Bank of the United States and its branches, m
conformity with the Piesident's opinion and by
appointing his successor to effect such removal,
v/hich has Leen done, the Piesident has assumed
the exercise of a power over the Treasury of the
United States not granted to him by the Consti-
tution and laws, and dangeiovs to the hbeities of
the people
2 " Resolved, That the reasons assigned by the
Secretary of the fteasury for the removal of the
money of the United States deposited in the Bank
of the United States and its branches, communi-
cated to Congress on the third day of December,
1833, are unsatisfactory and insufficient "
Mi B said that the first of these resolutions con-
tained impeachable matter, and was m fact, though
not in form, a duect impeachment of the President
of the United States He recited the constitutional
provision that the President might be impeached,
1, for treason, 2, for bubery 3, for high crimes,
4, for misdemeanors, and said that the first resolu
tion charge 1 both a high crime and misdemeanoi
upon the President a high crime in violating the
laws and Constitution to obtain a power over the
public treasure to the danger of the liberties of the
people, and a misderreanof m dismissing the late
Secretaiy of the Treasury from office Mi B
said that the terms of the íesolution were suffi
ciently explicit to define a high crime within the
meaning of the Constitution, without having le-
course to the arguments and declarations used by
the mover in illustration of his meaning But if
any doubt remained on that head it would be
lemoved by the whole tenor of the argument, and
especially that part of it which compared the
Piesident'  conduct to thatof Caisar in seizing the
public tieasure to aid him in putting an end to
the lioerties of his country, ami every Senator in
voting upon it would vote as directly upon the
guilt or innocence of the Piesident as if he was
íesponding to the question of guilty or not guilty
in the concluding scene of a formal impeachment
We are then, said Mr B , trying an impeach
ment But how' The Constitution gives to the
House of Representatives the sole power to origin
ate impeachments, yet we ougmate this impeach-
ment ourselves T he Constitution gives the accused
aught to bepiesent, but he is not here It requires
the Senate to be sworn as judges, but we aie not
so sworn It lequires the Chief Justice of the
United States to pre ide when the Piesident is
tried, but ^he Ohi°f Justice is not presiding It
gives the House of Representatives a right to be
present, and to manage the prosecution, but neither
the House nor its managers are here It requires
the forms of criminal justice to he strictly observed,
yet all these forms aie neglected and violated It
is a pioceeding in which the first Magistrate of
the Republic is to be tried without be ng heard,
and m which his accusers are to act as his judges
Mr 15 called upon the Senate to consider well
what they did before they proceeded furthei in the
consideration of this resolution He called upon
them to consider what was due, to the House of
Representatives,whose privilege was invaded, and
who had a right to send a message to the Senate
complaining of the proceeding, and demanding its
abandonment Heconjuied them toconsidei what
was due to the President, who was thus to be tried
in his absence for a most enoimous crime, what
was due to the Senate itself in thus combining the
incompatible chararteis of accusers and judges,
and which would itself be judged by Europe and
America He dwelt particulaily on the figure
which the Senate would make in going on with
the consideration of this resolution It accused
the President of violating the Constitution, and
itself committed twenty vio'ations of the same
Constitution in making the accusation1 Itaccused
him of violatingasingle law, and itself violated all
the laws of criminal justice in prosecuting him to
it It charged him with designs dangerous to the
Iibei ties of the citizens, and immediately trampled
upon the lights of all citizens in the person of
their Chief Magistrate
Mr B descanted upon the extraordinary organ
ization of the Senate, and drew an argumentfiom
it in favor of the reserve and decorum of their pro-
ceedings The Senate were lawgtveis, and ought
to respect the laws already made, they were the
constitutional advisers of thePresident, and should
observe as nearly as possible the civil íelations
which the office of adviser presumes They might
be his judges, and should be the last in the world
to stir up an accusation against him, to prejudge
his guilt, or to attack his character with defama-
tory language Decorum, the becoming ornament
of every functionary, should be the distinguishing
trait of an A menean Senator, who combines m his
own office the united dignities of the executive,
I the legislative, and thejudicial character In his
judicial character, especially, he should sacrifice to
decorum and propriety, and shun as he would the
contagious touch of sin and pestilence, the slight-
est ap roach to the character of prosecutor He
referred to Bntish parliamentary law to show that
the Lords could rot join in an accusation, because
they were to try it But here the Senate was sole
accuser, and had notningfrom the House of Rep-
resentatives to join, but made the accusation out
and out, and tr ed it themselves
He said the accusation was a double one, for a
high crime and a misdemeanor, and the latter a
l more flagrant proceeding than the former, for it
assumed to know for what cause the President had
dismissed his late Secretary, and undertook to try
the President for a thing which was not triable or
impeachable From the foundation of the Gov-
ernment it had been settled that the President's
right to dismiss his Secretaries resulted fiom his
constitutional obligation to see that the laws were
faithful'y executed Many Presidents had dis-
missed Secretaries, and this was the first time the
Senate had ever undertaken to found an ímpeach-
| ment upon it, or had assumed to know the reasons
for which it was done
j Mr B said that twootherimpeaehments seemed
to be going on at the same time against two
other officers—the Secretai y of the Treasury and
the Treasurei, so that the Senate was brim full of
criminal business The Treasuier and the Secre-
tary of the Treasury were both civil officers, and
were both hable to impeachment for misdemeanors
in office, and great misdemeanors were charged
upon them They were, in fact, upon trial with-
out the formality of a resolution, and if hereafter
impeached by the House of Representatives, the
Senate, if they believed what they heard, would be
ready to pionounce judgment, and remove them
. from office without delay or further examination
' Mr B then addressed himself to the Vice Pres-
ident [Mr Van Bdren] upon the novelty of the
scene which was going on before him, and the
gi eat change which had taken pla^e since he served
in the Senate He commended the peculiar deli-
cacy and decorum of the Vice Piesident himself,
who, in six years' service, in high party times,
and in a decided opposition,nevei uttered a word,
either in open or secret session, which could have
I wounded the feelings of a political adversary if he
had been present and heard it He extolled the
decorum of the opposition to President Adams's
administration If there was one brilliant excep-
tion, the error was redeemed by classic wit, and
the heroic readiness with which a noble heart
bared its bosom to the bullets of those who felt
aggrieved Still addressing himself to the Vice
Piesident, Mr B said that if he should receive
some hits in the place where he sat, without the
right to reply, he must find consolation in thecase
of his most illustrious predecessor, thegreatapostle
of American liberty, (Mr Jefferson,) who often
told his friends of the manner in which he had been
cut at when presiding over the Seriate, and per-
sonally annoyed by the inferior—no, young anil
inconsiderate—members of the old Federal party
I Mr B returned to the point in debate The
President, he repeated, was on trial for a high
dime, in seizing the public treasure in violation of
the laws and the Constitution Was the charge
true' Does the act which he has done deserve
the definition wmch has been put upon it> He had
made up his own mind that the public deposites
ought to be removed from the Bank of the United
States He communicated that opinion to the
Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary refused
to remove them, the President removed him, and
appointed a Secretary who gave the order which
he thought the occasion required All this he did
in virtue of his constitutional obligation to see the
laws fai'hfu'ly executed, and m obedience to the
same sense of du y which would lead him to dis-
miss a Secretary at War or of the Navy who
would refuse to give an order for troops to march
ora fleet to sail True, it is made the duty of the
Secretary of the Treasury to direct the removal of
the deposites but the Constitution makes it the
duty of the Pre=ident to see that the Secretary
perfoims his duty, and the Constitution isas much
above law as the President is above the Secre
, tary
'     The President is on trial for a misdemeanor—for
