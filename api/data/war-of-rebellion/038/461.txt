General GRANT:

I am this moment in, and have your dispatch. Telegraph me the moment you have Vicksburg in possession, and I will secure all the crossing of Black River, and move on Jackson or Canton, as you may advise. I want my own corps and Ord's, with Parke in reserve; train small; all of which will be arranged [when] I know for certain that you are in absolute possession. If you are in Vicksburg, glory, hallelujah! the best Fourth of July since 1776. Of course we must not rest idle, only don't let us brag too soon. I will order my troops at once to occupy the fords of the Big Black, and await with anxiety your further answer.

W. T. SHERMAN.

GRANT'S HEADQUARTERS, July 3, 1863.

General SHERMAN:

I judge Johnston is not coming to Vicksburg; he must be watched, though. I judge from the fact that I have just received a proposition from Pemberton to appoint three commissioners to arrange terms of capitulation, to save effusion of blood, &amp;c. I reply that the appointment of commissioners is unnecessary, because he could put an end to it by surrender, and be treated with all the respect due prisoners of war. When we go in, I want you to drive Johnston from the Mississippi Central Railroad; destroy bridges as far as Grenada with your cavalry, and do the enemy all the harm possible. You can make your own arrangements and have all the troops of my command, except one corps-McPherson's, say. I must have some troops to send to Banks, to use against Port Hudson.

GRANT'S HEADQUARTERS, July 3, 1863.

General SHERMAN:

There is but little doubt but the enemy will surrender to-night or in the morning; make your calculations to attack Johnston; destroy the road north of Jackson. The country from Baldwin's to Hankinson's is picketed and patrolled every day by Ord's force.

HEADQUARTERS Fifteenth ARMY CORPS,Camp near Bear Creek, July 3, 1863.

Colonel John A. RAWLINS:

DEAR COLONEL: I am in receipt of two dispatches from General Grant, telling me of the opening of negotiations for the surrender of Vicksburg, and ordering me to move against Johnston and to destroy the Central road as far north as Grenada, and generally to do the enemy as much damage as possible. I have heard some considerable heavy firing at Vicksburg this afternoon, which I do not understand, and am this moment (sundown), in receipt of a letter from Clark Wright, which I inclose. * I have no little faith in Colonel Wright that I would heed his messages very little, only I feel assured that every motive that could influence Johnston is at work to make him attempt to relieve
