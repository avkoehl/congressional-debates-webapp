No. 34. Reports of Lieutenant Edmund Mazyck, C. S. Artillery, Ordnance Officer, Battery Wagner.

CHARLESTON, September 6, 1863.

CAPTAIN: In accordance with your instructions, I have the honor to make the following [report] of the amount of ordnance stores in Battery Wagner at the time of its evacuation . I regret that this report cannot be given in exact numbers, the reasons for this I will hereafter explain:

The armament consisted of thirteen guns, including shell guns, howitzers, columbiads, and mortars. Of shot, shell, &amp;c., the following is an approximate: 10-inch shot, about 20; 10-inch shell, about 100; 10-inch grape, about 40; 10-inch canister, about 40; 8-inch shell, about 115; 8-inch canister, about 280; 8-inch grape, about 200; 32-pounder shot, about 100; 32-pounder canister, about 150; 32-pounder grape, about 100; 32-pounder shell, about 100; 12-pounder shrapnel, about 100; 12-pounder shell, about 50, and 12-pounder canister, about 120. There were other, articles in the magazine, such as cartridge-bags, and necessary implements, but of course the supply was quite limited, as we are all aware that the consumption of articles was enormous and the means of supply extremely limited. I endeavored to save as many articles as possible, and sent to Cumming's Point to be transported to the city about 50 rifles and double-barrel shotguns; also 1,500 assorted fuses and as many friction-tubes. All of these articles, I hope, will arrive .

I regret not being able to give a more exact account of the stores, but for prudential reasons all my accounts and papers had to be destroyed. I shall endeavor to think over the matter, and if necessary add any articles which may be herein omitted. The short time allowed for making my report has also interfered.

I have been unable to see Lieutenant [W. W.] Revely and obtain from him an account of such stores as he had, as ordnance officer, at Battery Gregg.

With much respect, I am, your obedient &c.,

EDMUND MAZYCK,

Lieutenant Artillery, and Ordnance Officer.

Captain T. A. HUGUENIN,

Chief of Artillery, Morris Island.

[Indorsement.]

There was a considerable quantity of projectiles at Cumming's Point not hauled up, of which I could get no report.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
