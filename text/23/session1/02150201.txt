re.ation between this system and those banks em-
p'oyed by the Secretaiy ot the Tieasury' There
is no lespon&ibihty, the one ioi the othe"—no
con nbution—no common lur d Hov/, men, can
it be said that the Secretary is endeavoimg to
extend this ¡system through tin. Union' There is
nothing in the Secretary's plan that ast>imi ates it
to the safety fund system What bearing, then,
has this system on the Secietary's planfordepos
iting ard ditsbu-sing the public money through the
S>ate batiks' None And its introduction to the
Senate so fiequently can only serve to gratify
those who wish to create distrust in its secun'y
He knew that no one on this floor would desire to
produce a panic in relation to any of our banks,
but there w ere those out of this Chamber who had
ci-ntiibuted all in their power to do it But ne
trusted, in regaid to the banks in New York, that
then eftjrts would be unsuccessful The people
of that State nad entire security The bill holders
and i'epoMtois under that system were altogether
safe, and from their safety atibes their confidence
in the system itself They aie prote"ted against
the possibility of loss The Senator, how evei, tells
us that the safety fund consists of about J>300,000,
.and that that sum would be but little more than
sufficient to cover the circulation of a single bank
1 hat fund is to beincrea&ed, it should be observed,
till it equals three per cent on the whole banking
capual of the State If in case of insolvency of
any bank the fund should not be sufficient after
applying its effects, then the banks again contnb
ute to the fund as before, and the creditor íecetves
the amount due him, with interest from tne time
his claim was presented A case can scarcely be
imagined wheie the effects of the bank itself, on
winding up, would not be sufficient to meet all its
engagements without a resort to the safety fund
Its stockholders might sustain loss, but its ciedit-
ors woukI not Thus it will be seen that unless
gentlemen can sunpose an entire msolverey of all
the banks of the State under this system, there is
not the possibil ty of loss to the ciedi'ors of any
of them The community, therefore, is safe But
there is anothei feature tnat adds still more to that
safety, and which guards the banks themselves—it
is the power of the bank commissioners to super
vise all their concerns Theirfiequentand peiiod
ical examinations keep them in perfect order, and
within the limits prescribed by their charters
This power of examination and supervision is of
the most salutaiy tendency Its silent operation
is useful It is a preventive to fraud or improper
conduct of any kind No board of directors, if
under other circumstances they might be induced
to exceed their bounds, would presume to under-
take it whilst this power could reach them and I
expose them at any moment
The Senator also alluded to the capital paid in
stock notes in many of the State banks     What
ever application this lemark may have e'sewhere,
i' h^s none to the safety fund banks   Their capital
is all actually paid in    There is no nominal capí  i
tal known to the system     This, too, must be i
done, and the most positive and indubitable proof '
furnished th<n it is done, before the lank can go
into opei ation    The same proof, in addition to the
personal examinaron of the commissioners, may
be requued, a' any time, that none of the capital
has been withdrawn     It will be perceived, then,
that the operations of these banks are on substan-
tial capital, and the supeivision of the commis-
sioneis is a guarantee to the public, and to the
stock! oldeis, of the fidelity of those who manage
and dnect t leir affairs
So far, then, from this system having anything
m it objectionable, it presents the strongest safe
guards and security to the community The great
evil heretofore, in our banking system, has been
the insecui ity of the people By this system per
feet safet) and security aie obtained These are
the main objects We do not incorporate such
mstitu'ions foi the sole benefit of stockholder—
they are at best monopolies—and the people should
alwiys require and leeeive si fficient guarantees
for their own safety Whatever panic, therefore,
mny be cr nted, the people, the creditors of the
safety fund banks of NewYoik, cannot sutler,
and (said 'Sir T ) I trust there is intelligence
enough amongst the people of that Stat? not to
permit themselves to be deluded by these panic
cries that are so industriously sent through the
country.
Sir, (said Mr T ,) the Senator from Kentucky
has exhibited to us what he calis a statement of the
small amount of specie in the vaults of our country
banks Why, sir, to those who know the course
of tiade and business of New York, this would
excite no surprise The country banks have never
been in the habit of keeping large amounts of idle
funds in their vaults They know their own in
terest better—they know the interest of the com-
munity better Their surplus funds are deposited
in Albany and New York, on which they can
draw, at any time Those funds are convertible
into specie at any moment A westein merchant,
for instance, wishes to remit to the city of New
York, where from the course of trade, his pay-
ments are to be made, he would much prefer a
draft on one of the banks in that city, than thebills
of the bank in his neighborhood, or e\en the
specie—the d aft is better to him than the specie
Wheie, then, is the necessity of hoai ding up a large
amount of specie in their own vaults, when they
can deposite then surplus funds in New York and
Albany, and, under certain stipulations, receive
interest on tnem' This mode is for then own
interest, and for the benefit of the community
These funds, which are convertible into specie
at any moment, together with the specie in the
vaults of the banks outof Albanyand New York,
amounted, according to the report of the bank
commissioners, on the 1st of January last, to
forty/out pel centum on their whole circulation
Allowing, then, that this panic operation should
succeed so far as to thiow upon them, in one tn
slant, nearly one half of the whole amount of the
bills of those banks now in circulation, they have
the means at command to meet them, and this,
too, without looking to their large and substantial
note account, which is daily becoming due and
receivable
There are no banks (said Mr T ) which have
more ready or substantial means to meet all their
engagements of every description     There are no
banks, in the aggregate, more sound     The Uni-
ted States Bank itself is not moie so     If cannot
presentmore, ifitcan as much, substantial means
He did not doubt its safety, but he should be glad
to believe that it had as much substantial means
to meet all engagements as the safety fund banks
of New York   If (said Mr T ) this panic, about
which so much is said, can be made to extend
amongst the people, as some seem to desire it
should, he would rather be a creditor of those
banks than of the Bank of the United States     If
any serious disasters follow fiom this panic,from
the loss of confidence, and the consequent loss of
credit, rely upon it, the Bank of the United States
will come in for its full share of the calamity
But, says the Senator from Kentucky, if public
confidence should be impaired, and these banks
i should be run for specie, they could not redeem
their bills    This is trae of any bank—of the Um-
, ted States Bank—of all banks—none of them ever
I have an amount of specie equal to the redemption
I of all their bi'13 m circulation—of course, if public
confidence, as to their solvency, should be so far
impaired as to bring in upon them all their bills,
they could not redeem them in vpecie   But still, if
they have been managed properly, they will have
' abundance of means to answer all the demands that
can be made upon them   Mr T said, so far as his
acquaintance extended, the safety fund banks were
in the most discreet and substantial hands    He
knew instances wheresomemdividual stockholders
and directors were worth double and treble the
whole amount of the capital of the bank to which
they belong.    Can the community lack confidence
in such banks'   Can the people doubt their sol-
vency ? Can they doubt theirow n security from loss
even if any one should fail, as long as an ample
fund is provided for their safety'   No, sir, theie
are individuals, (said Mr T ,) such as he had de-
scribed, who would give ample security, by bond
and mortgage, for any amount of bills that could
be piesented
Sir, the Senator from Kentucky, on some news-
paper authority, has stated that the bank commis-
sioners have taken a large amount of money
belonging to the canal fund, and loaned it in New
York, to meet the redemption of the bills of coun-
try banks Mr T said he had seen no such
statement, but come fiom what source it might,
he did not hesitate to pronounce it untrue—and for
the best of reasons, that the bank commissioners
have no power, by law, over the canal fund, and
can m no event, nor under any circumstances,
use it
One word (said Mr T ) for the Senator from
Ohio, [Mr Eyvinu ] He condemns the safety-
fund system, from its tendency to destroy that
watchfulness of the banks over each other which,
would otherwise exist That, inasmuch as they
are responsible for each other, in case of failure,
they would not return the paper of each, with
that vigilance, which they would do, acting inde-
pendently—that they are peifectly safe, says he,
in issuing paper to any amount they please—that
there is no limit to their issues Perhaps (said
Mr T 1 the gentleman will allow something to
experience and obseivation He (Mr T ) had
witnessed all these operations, and he had found,
under this system, a far greater watchfulness of
the banks over each other than formerly existed
A healthy watchfulness—not a disposition to ha-
rass and vex, as was sometimes the case under
the old system, but to see that each kept within ita
pioper limits as prescribed by the cnarter There
is competition between them, but it is a healthy
competition—it is salutary in its operation As
to then issues, the gentleman need give himself
no alaim on that subject They aie limited by
law, and he would venture to say, there were no
banks in the Union whic-h were so muchiestrained
ii then issues They weie far less than the banks
under the old system weie allowed to issue—and
he had no doubt that in proportion to capital and
the increased business of the Stite.the cuculation
was, at this time, in a less ratio than before thia
system was adopted
Whatever efforts then, rray be made, and from
whatever quarter they may be made, to increase
the panic, Mi T said he trusted that the confi-
dence of the country could not easily be shaken.
He hoped the honorable Senator from Kentucky
wou'd soon get round Point Judith, to which he
had alluded, and speed ily arrive in that calm haven
which he so much desired And if he (Mr T )
could judge from the symptoms of distress which
usually attend those who perform that voyage, he
should suppose the honorable Senator was now
doubling that point
Mr CLVST replied, if the gentleman from New-
Yoik would lefer to the report 01 the Secretary of
the Treasuiy, and the agent of the Government,
he would see the outline of the system very clearly
defined Mi C regretted that the gentleman
could not explain the item of the five millions in
the repoit of the commissioners
Some further brief remarks were made by Mr.
CHAMBERS, Mr EWING, and Mr TALL-
MADGE
Mr WRIGHT said he regretted to enter into
this debate at ail, but he felt it due to himself and
the subject to give the answer which he had prom-
ised to the honoraole Senator from Kentucky,
[Mr Clay,] and before he did that he would say
that he rejoiced that there was no intention in this
body to pioduce an excitement in the country;
that the Senatoi did not intend to produce that
effect by the i emarks he had made, but that he was
able to add the gentleman'& distinct denial that
such was his intention
ile must be permitted further to say, before he
replied to the interrogatory of the Senator, in jus-
tice to the Bank of lthica, in his State, the bank
which the gentleman had named, that the remarks
he had made in relation to it are most eminently
calculated to produce the very effect upon that
institution which the Senator did not mean to pro-
duce He must not be misunderstood. He im-
puted no intention, but he must say that the state-
ment of the honorable gentleman [Mr Clat] as
to the Bank of lthica, the large amount of bi'ls
he had stated to be in circulation from that bank,
and the very small amount of means to redeem
them, unexplained, was dnectlyand most happily
calculated to produce a panic in the public mind
in the vicinity of that bank, and to cause the run
upon it which he was happy to find it was the
desire of all to avoid
He must further say, that while he would not
