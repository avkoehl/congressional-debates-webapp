HDQRS. DEPT. OF MISS. AND E. La., May 1, 1863.

Major-General STEVENSON:

Another brigade must be sent to General Bowen as soon as possible; troops from above must be moved down to supply its place. You are stronger in that direction and at Snyder's Mill than the necessity demands, I think.

By order of Lieutenant-General Pemberton:

J. THOMPSON,Assistant Inspector-General.

Vicksburg, May 1, 1863.

General STEVENSON:

I am directed by the lieutenant-general commanding to call your attention to a communication of to-day, in relation to arming 600 exchanged prisoners, who have just arrived at Jackson. He desires to know if you can arm then.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

H. C. TUPPER.

Vicksburg, May 1, 1863.

Captain H. C. TUPPER, Aide-de-Camp:

CAPTAIN: In reply to your letter of this date with regard to the exchanged prisoners, I have the honor to state that I have already in my command a number of unarmed men whom I am unable to supply with arms, and consequently will not be able to arm them.

I am, captain, respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. L. STEVENSON.

Vicksburg, May 1, 1863.

Brigadier-General TILGHMAN, Big Black:

Move at once with two regiments of your brigade, via Edwards Depot, to join Bowen. Take forage at Edwards Depot.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

Vicksburg, May 1, 1863.

General TILGHMAN, Edwards Station:

Hurry on your two regiments as rapidly as possible. Wait yourself for General Loring.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

Vicksburg, May 1, 1863.

General TILGHMAN, Edwards Station:

Take no artillery. Send your two regiments with greatest dispatch to Grand Gulf by dirt road. Wait for Loring yourself.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

Vicksburg, May 1, 1863.

General TILGHMAN, Edwards Depot:

Loring will take the Point Coupee Artillery from Jackson. This is all the artillery to go. I expected your two regiments to be on the march, by dirt road, from Edward Depot before this.
