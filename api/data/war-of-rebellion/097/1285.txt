Brevet Major-General EMORY,

Commanding Department of West Virginia, Cumberland:

I am directed to inform you that General Duval's command arrived at Winchester on the 17th en route to Cumberland. Please advise these headquarters as soon as it arrives, as it is desired to break up the Provisional Division which it represents and assign it as a brigade to one of your divisions. When can you send the battalion of infantry to General Brooke which you had some time since? You can send this information when you notify us of the arrival of Duval's command.

A. E. KING

Cumberland, Md.:

Three regiments of cavalry will be kept at Winchester-the Fifth and Twenty-second New York and Twelfth Pennsylvania. I mention this for your government, as it is presumed that the Army of the Shenandoah will be embraced in that command. It is now within its geographical limits, I find.
