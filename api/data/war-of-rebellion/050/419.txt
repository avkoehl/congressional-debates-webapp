right wing of the Seventy-fourth Indiana was thrown too far forward, being exposed in its new position to a terrible fire on the right flank, in consequence of which Colonel Chapman ordered that flank to be thrown farther back.

Up to this time, although exposed to a severe fire under which the loss in killed and wounded had been considerable, the regiment held its position unwaveringly and returned the enemy's fire with commendable coolness and alacrity. When the order to retire the right flank was given it was misunderstood for a command to retire the whole line, and the regiment was momentarily thrown into confusion, but immediately rallied and took position on the right of the Tenth Kentucky, where it fought unflinchingly until its 60 rounds of cartridges had been expended, when it was relieved and went to the rear for ammunition. Being replenished with 60 additional rounds of cartridges, the regiment was moved to the right along the Ringgold road about 500 yards, when it was formed again in line of battle, the Fourteenth Ohio on the right, the Fourth Kentucky in the center, and the Seventy-fourth Indiana on the left, the command of the three regiments being assigned to Colonel Chapman, devolving the command of this regiment on me. This line was advanced about 2 p. m., steadily driving the enemy before it for over half a mile, when our advance was checked by the overwhelming numbers of the enemy, who concentrated a destructive artillery and infantry fire upon our single line, which was at the time wholly unsupported. Up to this time no artillery had been employed to assist us, owing to the nature of the ground and the density of the thick woods through which the battle raged. It was in this contest that Lieutenant Thomas Bodley fell mortally wounded as Lieutenant Richard H. Hall had fallen in the first encounter. Both of these officers died the same day, having discharged their duties faithfully and well. It was here also that 8 other of the line officers of the regiment were wounded and the loss of enlisted men very heavy. It was at this time also that Colonel Chapman was seriously injured and disabled for command by the fall of his horse, which had been killed under him. It was here that we charged the rebel lines, but being overpowered after a desperate struggle for the mastery of the ground, I ordered the regiment to fall back, and took position on a ridge about 300 yards in rear of where our advance was checked. This was the last struggle in which the Seventy-fourth Indiana was engaged on that day.

The following are the names of the officers who were wounded on the 19th instant: Colonel Charles W. Chapman, Captain Andrew S. Milice, Captain Samson J. North, Captain Everett F. Abbott, Captain Joel F. Kinney, First Lieutenant Ananias Davis, First Lieutenant David P. Deardoff, Second Lieutenant Richard H. Hall, Second Lieutenant John Snider, a total of 11 out of 24 officers who went into the engagement. I have attached hereto a list with the name and rank of each officer and enlisted man killed and wounded in the engagement.*
