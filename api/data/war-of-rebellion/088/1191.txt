GENERAL: In compliance with your instructions received last night, Captain Penick is sent with thirty men to report to Colonel Walker. We will make out to man his guns in case they are needed. We are not altogether idle here; a moderate fire is kept up at night on the enemy at Dutch Gap, where it is pretty well ascertained they are cutting a channel. Two of my companies, Utterback's and Williams', were sent to Colonel Carter a few days since in obedience to order from General Lee.

I am, general, with high respect, your obedient servant,
