General STANLEY:

No news by signal from Allatoona. Heavy firing, indicating an assault and repuse. Occasional shots now, but too smoky to see signals. Can see the fields about Lost Mountain. No large force of rebels there. Can see Kilpatrick's cavalry massed in a big field this side, but no skirmishing.
