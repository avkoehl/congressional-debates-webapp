Let this be done on all the roads leading northward, in order that the enemy may be prevented from sending away from Nashville any stores they may have accumulated there. General Hood thinks that small parties, under the right men, would move more successfully than larger ones, and that we can't spare the larger ones.

A. P. MASON.
HEADQUARTERS JACKSON'S CAVALRY DIVISION,In the Field, November 20, 1864.

TO THE OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS OF THE DIVISION:

We are about entering upon an active and important campaign, one that will require the utmost promptness and precision in the execution of all orders and stubborn fighting on the part of all of us. Associated as we are now with a new and gallant command, I appeal to you to do your whole duty as soldiers; behave as gentlemen on the march and in action; endure hardships without a murmur; show proper respect to citizens and private property; have no straggling, and let every man be in his place at all times. I earnestly request brigade commanders to see that every article of property purchased or impressed is promptly and accurately settled for, and commanding officers of all grades to command their men and preserve the fair name of the division untarnished.

W. H. JACKSON,

Brigadier-General.
