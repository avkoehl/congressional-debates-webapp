(Received 2.10 p.m.)

Major-General HURLBUT:

I have sent dispatch to Mower by rail. Have ordered him to fall back as soon as he finds beyond a doubt that Forrest has crossed Hatchie. I am under the impression that Forrest will go down on east side of Hatchie. It looks to me like we will get them sure this time.

Brigadier General GEORGE W. CULLUM,

Chief of Staff:

MY DEAR GENERAL: Your esteemed favor of 15th instant has just this moment come to hand, and I am under many obligations to you for writing it. That rumors and reports have been sent North giving an account of my reported "secesh" tendencies, I am well aware, but I am not going to be swerved from what I conceive to be my duty by all the reports that envy, malice, and slander can suggest.
