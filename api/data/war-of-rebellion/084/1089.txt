TO THE OFFICER IN COMMAND OF THE FRENCH FORCES ON THE RIO GRANDE, NEAR BOCA DEL RIO:

SIR: I have the honor to inquire what will be your course of conduct in the event the forces under your command invest the city of Matamoras? Will you respect persons and property covered by the flag of the Confederate States of America? It is probable the occupation of the Boca del Rio by your forces will interrupt the transportation of supplies to Matamoras. In view of that contingency I have authorized Lieutenant-Colonel Fisher and Major Hyllested to endeavor to conclude an arrangement with you by which our supplies can be passed over the Rio Grande, within your lines, and transported to Fort Brown on this bank. These requests are made with frankness, and with a grateful remembrance of the generous sympathy the Government and people of France have evinced toward those struggling for the night of forming their own government and choosing their own rulers.

I have the honor to be, your very obedient servant,

JOHN S. FORD,

Colonel, Commanding Confederate Forces on the Lower Rio Grande.

COLONEL: I have the honor to reply to your letter of yesterday, the 24th. If the exigencies of war should take me to Matamoras you may rest assured that I shall see that all persons and property covered by the flag of your nation are duly respected. With regard to the facilities I might offer you in the transportation os supplies to your camp, you may be sure that I will bestow all my care upon this matter, and that you shall not suffer in anything on account of my presence here. Let it be understood that i cannot be responsible for any depredations the guerrillas may for the next few days be able to commit, in the exercise of their industry. It has afforded me great pleasure to receive Lieutenant-Colonel Fisher and Major Hyllested, and I shall take great pleasure to return the visit which they have made me in your name.

Please to accept, colonel, the assurance of my great respect,
