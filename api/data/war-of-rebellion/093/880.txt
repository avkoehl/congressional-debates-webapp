A. VON SCHRADER,

Lieutenant Colonel and Asst. Insp. General, Department of the Cumberland.

[Inclosure Numbers 2.]
HEADQUARTERS CAMP OF ORGANIZATION,Chattanooga, Tenn., November 12, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel VAN SCHRADER,

Inspector-General Army of the Cumberland:

COLONEL: I have the pleasure of handing you, in compliance with your request, the following approximate statement of the organizations, shipments, &amp;c., made by me since the 1st instant, under Special Orders, Numbers 300, headquarters Army of the Cumberland:

There have been six camps organized-one for each of the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and Twentieth Corps; one for convalescents of all other corps (principally fourth and Twenty-third Corps); and one for the recruits, conscripts, substitutes, &c., going forward to the corps at front who are unable to join their corps. These camps are well located-I think healthful-and are being got into good shape. They are near the site of the old Fort Palmer, convenient as possible to water, but not sufficiently so to wood. The men are all under tentage, and are becoming comfortable.
