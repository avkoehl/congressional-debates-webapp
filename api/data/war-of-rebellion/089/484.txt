HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,OFFICE OF THE PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL,

November 2, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Four deserters, forwarded from the Ninth Army Corps to-day, represent MacRae's brigade, of Heth's division, and Lane's brigade, of Wilcox's division. None of them were able to locate with any certainly their brigades. Deserter from MacRae thinks his brigade is back in the position it held previous to the late movement. Lane's is on the right of that, and McGowan's next. Can give no other positions. They think the line is now extended much farther to the right than before the late movement. No knowledge of re-enforcements being received or troops sent away.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers C. BABCOCK.
