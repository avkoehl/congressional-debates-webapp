derived from the States of Maryland and Vir-
ginia, by virtue of certain acts in which they
ceded to Congiess this District Had Congress
been invested with no other power than that of
exclusive legislation over the " ten miles square,
could there be any question with regard to the
extent of their power? Or would it have been '
alleged in that case that all laws passed by Con-
gress weie essentially national in their chaiacter,
and operative without, as we'l as within, the
limits of the District' I presume not, sir, be-
cause the power of exclusive legislation which Con-
gress exercise over the District of Columbia can
be of no greater extent than if such powei had
been the only one confeired. Congress cannot ex-
ercise exclusive legislative power over the States,
because of the reservation of power to the States,
or to the people thereof Even ovei the " ten
miles square" the power of Congress is limited
by the acts of " cession " With what piopnety,
then, can it be contended that because a law is
passed by Congress, it is, therefore, a law of the
United States, and of universal obligation ' No,
sir, whenever Congress legislate in vntue of their
local and exclusive jurisdiction over the District
of Columbia, they act as a local or municipal
Legislature, and the acts passed by them in that
capacity are limited in then operation to the ter-
ritory of the District A law of Congiess, to
have the effect of a law of the United States,
must be passed m execution of some of the Fed-
eral poweis, or, in other words, in pursuance of
delegated power. But all laws of Congiess
passed in virtue of the power to exercise exclu- I
sive legislation over the District of Columbia ate '
local or municipal in their chaiacter, and cannot j
operate extra-terntorially, or beyond the limits
of the District True, there aie certain laws
passed by Congress which have a local reference
to this District, and which pioceed from the del-
egated powers with which Congress aie invested
Acts appropriating money for the election of pub-
lic buildings,&c , are of this description These
acts, although local in their immediate opeiation, I
have reference to national objects, are passed in
virtue of the general legislative powers, and are
general or national in their character
Congress can exercise no power, by virtue of
the sixteenth clause of the eighth section of the
Constitution, over the District of Columbia that
it would not have been competent for Maryland
and Virginia to have exercised prior to making
the cession The " exclusive powers of legisla-
tion," therefore, possessed byCongress over the
" ten miles square," are of the kind which were
never delegated to the General Government, but
reserved to the States To say that the powei of
exclusive legislation conferred upon Congress by
the sixteenth clause of the eighth section of the
Constitution embraced any of the general powers
contained m any of the fitteen preceding clauses
of the eighth section, would be to charge the
framers ot the Constitution with granting a repe-
tition of powers by distinct articles This is not
to be presumed, neither is it to be presumed that
the framers of the Constitution conferred upon
Congress Federal powers concurrent with exist-
ing State powers No, sir, the framers of the
American Constitution, as wise and patriotic men,
conferred no powers upon Congress that were
calculated to beget strife and contention, and in-
stead of promoting, mar the harmony which ever
ought to subsist between the National and State
Governments, and equally wise and cautious were
they in combining the Federal and local or State
powers in such manner as that Congress, in dis-
charging the double functions of a Federal and
State Legislature, should not confound nor pro-
duce a collision between these powers or func-
tions Ihus Congress, I repeat, as the General or
Federal Legislature, exercises the general powers
delegated by the States, and, as a local or State
Legislature, exercises, from time to time, the re-
served and undelegated powers pertaining to the
States In the former capacity, Congress may
declare war or make peace, " coin money, and
regulate the value thereof," &e , but cannot legis-
late with regard to the local wants and interests
of this District, but in the latter capacity, Con-
gress may incorporate companies, build bridges,
open streets, in a word, supply the wants and
meet the exigencies of the District, precisely in
Abolition Petitions—Mr. Moore.
the same manner that a State Legislature may do
with regard to a State And the laws passed by
Congress in this State or local capacity are neces-
sarily limited in their opeiation to the District of
Columbia, precisely as a State law is confined in
its operation to the State limits If the laws passed
by Congress in their local legislative capacity had
the effect of United States laws, the banks of this I
Distnct would be United States banks, and the
insurance companies United States insurance com-
panies
The District of Columbia is, m all respects,
whether as a sovereignty or as a community, as
much independent of the Federal Legislature, j
when acting in their Federal capacity, as are Geoi-
gia and Noith Carolina, or as those States are of
each other The Federal Legislature, therefore,
as such, possess no moie power over the subject
of slavery within the limits of this District than
they do over that subject within the limits of
those States Consequently, Congress aie no
moie bound to receive petitions from the citizens
of the States praying for the abolition of slavery
in the District of Columbia than the Legislature
of a sovereign and independent State would be
bound to ieoeive petitions fiom the citizens of
another soveieign and independent State, or, than
the Legislattue of a State would be bound to re-
ceive petitions fiom the citizens of the District of
Columbia, touching the domestic interest and in-
ternal police of such State Hence the popular
fallacy with icgard to the right of petition The
question is not as to the nght of petition, but as
to the destination or dmction which pttitions
should take. Admitting that citizens of a State
have a right to petition their Legislature, touch-
ing any subject of gnevance over which the Le-
gislature may have jurisdiction, and that the cit
lzens of the United States have also a right to
petition the Federal Legislature on all subjects of
a Federal character, does it follow, therefore, that
the citizens of one State have a right to petition
the Legislature of another State, concerning its
domestic institutions and internal police ' Or,
that citizens of the United States have a right to I
petition the Fedeial Legislature on a subject that i
is not Federal, but strictly local in its clnracter, I
and with which the petitioners have no right to
intermeddle' Certainly not And as the cm
zens of Veimont or Connecticut, for example,
have no more right to inteifere with the domestic
institutions of the Disttictof Columbia than they
have with the domestic institutions of the State
of Maryland or Virginia, which is just none at t
all, they might, with the same propriety, petition
the Legislatures of those States to abolibh sla
very within then limits, as to petition the local
Legislature of this District to abolish slaveiy
within its limits And as it would not and could
not be considered a denial of the right of petition
on the part of the Legislature of eithet of those
States to reject such petitions, so neither could it
be regarded as a denial of such right for Con-
gress, the local legislature of the District of Co
lumbia (and it has been already shown that it is
only in this local capacity that Congress can have
jurisdiction over the subject at all) to íeject sim-
ilar petitions fiom citizens of those or ¿tny othei
States
It matters not, therefore,whether Congress have
the power to abolish slavery within the District
of Columbia or not, as Congress is not bound, in
either case, to receive petitions fiom the citi7ens
of the States touching the subject of slavery within
this District—such citizens having no right to in
terfere with this or any other subject of internal
police within the District   What, sir, could it be I
regarded as a denial of the legitimate exercise of j
the right of petition on the part of Congress, to re- j
ject petitions from citizens of the States praying
Congress to nairow or widen the stieets m this
city, or in the city of Georgetown, or of Alexan
dría, or to repeal the charters of the incorporated
companies within this Distnct, or otherwise to
change, alter, or in any way affect the municipal
institutions or internal police of the District' No j
man, I apprehend, will so allege; and why not' ]
For the reason, sir, that the petitioners would
have no right or authority to intermeddle with I
the local rights and interests of an i ndependent com-
munity—a community as absolutely independ-
ent of the petitioners, in all the respects just men-

tioned, as are the municipalities of France. And,
as the institution of slavery in the District of Co-
lumbia, as well as in tire slave States, is, in «11
respects and to all intents ahd purposes, local in
its character, Congress are no more bound to en-
tertain petitions fiom citizens of the States ask-
ing for its abolition, than if such petitions related
to the municipal institutions of a foreign country.
If Congress would not be bound to receive peti-
tions in the one case, they would not m the othei;
and (Consequently, if it would not be a denial of the
right of petition toieject, in the one case, it would
not besom the other. I repeat, then, that whether
Congress have the power to abohshslavei y within
the District of Columbia or not, itcannot be regard-
ed as ademal of the light of petition forCongress to
reject petitions from citizens of the States, p aymg
for the exercise of such right, no more than it
would be for them to íeject petitions from the sub-
jects of a foreign Power asking for similar action
Were the institution of slavery in the District of
Columbia general and national in its character,
instead of being, as it is, strictly and essentially
local and municipal, then would the citizens of
the States, I giant, be authoiized to petition the
National Legislature concerning it, and the Na-
tional Legislature, recognizing the right of peti-
tion, would be bound to leceive such petitions, ii
couched in respectful language But under our
existing form of government, and under existing
circumstances, Congress are not bound, and in
tiuth have no legitimate right, to entertain peti-
tions fiom individuals residing without the limits
of this District touching the abolition of slaveiy,
or any other subject of a local and municipal chai-
actti, affecting merely the citizens residing within
the District
Such being my views, then, I can but regard
those petitioners—resident of the States—pray-
ing Congress to abolish sla\ery in the District oí
Columbia, as guilty of an impeitmentand unwar-
rantable mteiference with the rights, privileges,
and interests of a fiee and independent commu-
nity And so long, su, as 1 entertain my present
opinions, I shall feel constrained to reprobate any
action on the part of Congress which may be cal-
culated to give countenance and encomagement
to such mischievous and audacious interfeience
Sir, by receiving these petitions, we tacitly yield
oui assent to acts of aggiession on the rights of
those whom it is our peculiar duty and piovinco
to defend and protect
Let Congress promptly reject all petitions em-
anating from citizens of the States, praying for
the abolition of slavery in the District of Colum-
bia, and this corroding and wide spreading evil
will be speedily ai rested The Halls of Congress,
su, have been converted into abolition laboiato
nos, wheie this accumulating mischief is com-
pounded and refined, where it receives its point
and potency, and whence it is fulminated upon
the countiy
But again, sir, Congress have no constitutional
authority to abolish slavery in the District of Co-
lumbia, without the consent of the slave ownei"
The Constitution declares that " no peison shall
be deprived of his property without due process
of law, and that private property shall not be
taken for public use without compensation " An
attempt to render this language of the Constitu-
tion moie explicit 01 more emphatic, by any com-
ments of mine, could but be regaided as a reflec-
tion upon the intelligence of this House If Con-
gress cannot constitutionally take private piop-
erty, except it be for public use, and only then by
making compensation to the owneis thereof, and
this is the only true and legitimate construction,
by what authonty can they wrest from citizens of
the Distnct their private property' Such acts un-
questionably would be without the shadow of con-
stitutional warrant The advocates of abolition-
ism, therefore, in order to surmount this consti-
tutional impediment to their schemes, must show,
in the first place, that the citizens of the District
of Columbia constitute no part of the citizens of
the United States, and, in the second place, that
slave property is not private property When-
evei they shall successfully do this, 1 will admit
that the American Constitution affords no guar
antee against the violation of the lights of prop-
eity, and that Congress may, constitutionally
abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, with-
