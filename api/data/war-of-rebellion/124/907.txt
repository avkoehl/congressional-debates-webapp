The total quota, therefore, of New York for the next draft, in case another is rendered necessary by a failure to raise sufficient volunteers, as it appears from the records up to the 17th instant, would be 60,378, the quota of 300,000 herein assigned, and the deficiency up to the date specified, that is, 47,657; total quota, 60,378.

But this total deficiency (47,657) will, of course, be reduced by all held to service under the present draft after the 17th instant, and by all volunteers not heretofore credited, as well as by all the State may raise in excess of 60,378, her quota of 300,000 as called for by the President's proclamation.

If Your Excellency thinks best to subdivide the quotas herein assigned to Congressional districts, and allot proportional parts to smaller subdivisions of your State, I would suggest that for harmonizing the subject of credits in drafts hereafter you regard the enrollment of the first class made by this Bureau as the basis of assignment.

The provost-marshals-general of your State and the boards of enrollment in the different districts will give you all the aid in their power in this and all other matters connected with raising troops.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.

WAR DEPT., PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., October 21, 1863.

His Excellency JAMES Y. SMITH,

Governor of Rhode Island, Providence, R. I.:

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that Rhode Island's quota of the 300,000 volunteers called for by the President's proclamation of the 17th instant is as follows: First District, 1,399; Second District, 635; total, 2,034.

This quota is the proportion of the 300,000 men which Rhode Island should furnish, according to the number of men of the first class enrolled in that State, and without any regard to the quota assigned her for the present draft, or the number of men obtained under that draft.

The quota of Rhode Island for the present draft was as follows: 1,980 to First District, 900 to Second District; total, 2,880.

Up to the 17th instant the number obtained on these quotas was as follows: First District, 699; Second District, 534; total obtained, 1,233, leaving on present draft as made up to the 17th instant a deficiency of 1,647.

On all calls previous to the present draft Rhode Island had furnished an excess of 964, set off against the deficiency of men obtained on the present draft, reduces such deficiency to 683.

The total quota, therefore, of Rhode Island for the next draft, in case a draft is rendered necessary by a failure to raise volunteers, as it appears from the records up to the 17th instant, would be 2,034, the quota of the 300,000 herein assigned, and the deficiency up to the date specified, that is, 683; total quota, 2,717. The next deficiency (683) will of course be reduced by all held to service under the present draft after the 17th instant, and by all volunteers not heretofore credited, as well as by all the State may raise in excess of 2,034, her quota of 300,000 as called for by the President's proclamation.
