HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, Bethesda Church, June 3, 1864-7.35 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: We have carried the first line of the enemy's works, and are now reforming the line, with a view to assaulting the main line. The resistance is very determined. We have taken prisoners from both Hill's and Ewell's corps, but it is possible that they have but or two divisions from each corps. The prisoners are from one of Hill's and two of Ewell's. Our loss has been considerable. The loss of the enemy in the attack of last night was very great, at least it is so represented by prisoners. There are indications that the enemy are moving to our left-not definite.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, Bethesda Church, June 3, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Our right has communicated with Wilson's division, of cavalry. General Potter's division has carried two lines of refle-pits, and is now in them, close to the main line. We will make an effort to take this line. We hold across the Shady Grove road on our right, and shall make an effort to cut their line just opposite this place. The enemy is very strong in our front.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
