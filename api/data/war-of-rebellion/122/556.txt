of condition of our troops believe it will be impossible to send more than one regiment (the Twenty-second, Colonel Wilson's) to Hempstead before the time mentioned by you. Chief obstacle to sending others is deficiency of clothing, which we are hurrying.

Honorable A. SAUNDERS,

Governor, &amp;c., Omaha, Nebr. Ter.:

SIR: Your favor of the 9th ultimo has been submitted to the Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance for a report. I learn that there are no arms due to the Territory of Nebraska. The quota due under the last legislation of Congress was issued to the Territory in August last. All the arms now on hand are required to meet the requisitions of the troops mustered into the service of the United States. We are expecting supplies from abroad very shortly. When they arrive, if your requisition be made upon the Ordnance Bureau, the department will be glad to furnish them if in its power.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully,

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

Governor MORGAN,

New York or Albany:

How many of Colonel Serrell's engineer regiment are enrolled? Can you by any means get it ready within the next four or five days? If not the whole regiment, what part of it may we expect? Answer immediately.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

NEW YORK, October 2, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

Dispatch of 2nd received; 470 are mustered here, 140 not mustered; 217 additional have been recruited in New Jersey, but held by the Governor of the State. Colonel Serrell is now with me. He requires two weeks to complete the regiment to 1,000.

E. D. MORGAN,

Governor.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Governor MORGAN,

New York:

We would like to have Colonel Serrell's regiment, or all that can be ready, sent to Hempstead to join General Sherman. It will be a fine opportunity for the colonel. His command will be most useful. If desired, I will request Governor Olden to send Jersey recruits to Hempstead. All the tools required are now provided by Sherman. Answer.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.
