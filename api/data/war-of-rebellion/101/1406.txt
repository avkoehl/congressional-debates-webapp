the general commanding desires to know if you wish to make any changes, and also that the cavalry regiments may be dismounted.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. R. BOGGS,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,Shreveport, La., February 28, 1865.

His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS,

President of the Confederate States:

Telegram of January 31* received 23rd February. It is physically impossible to cross troops over the Mississippi at this season. When the streams fall and the river bottoms become passable the attempt will be made if the enemy's operations here permit. This will not be before June. If it is desired I should cross with the troops, to whom shall I turn over the command of the department? I cannot at this season control military operations on both banks of the Mississippi, and should not be charged with its responsibilities. In the summer, to a certain extent, it may be practicable. Now the communication by individuals is uncertain, dangerous, and difficult in the extreme; by bodies it is impossible. The enemy has massed a force of not less than 50,00 men between Morganza and New Orleans, and has collected a formidable fleet of gun-boats and transports. Mobile is believed to be their objective point. Both that place and Red River are reported as theaters of intended operations. Red River has overflown its banks, and the season is most propitious for a successful advance.

General, Commanding.
