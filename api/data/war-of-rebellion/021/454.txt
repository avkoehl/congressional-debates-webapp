The family, all of whom were present, did not deny of having aided in his escape, and frankly gave me to understand that they would not reveal to us his hiding place were it known to them. It was, moreover, subsequently ascertained that they had purposely deceived us in regard to the time of his departure, in order to give him time to make his escape. They furthermore declared that they were deeply interested in the rebellion; that they were anxious for the frustration of the object of Colonel McMillan's expedition; that with their consent and approbation the men on their estate had engaged in the attempt to defeat him; that witch their knowledge and assistance the men had eluded our pursuit; that they held no allegiance to the Government of the United State, and neither desired nor claimed its protectional.
