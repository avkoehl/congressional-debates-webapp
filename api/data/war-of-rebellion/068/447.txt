General WILLIAMS:

A rebel major taken prisoner reports that Longstreet was wounded and Pickett killed in the attack of this afternoon. Already two colors have been picket up at one spot. Half dozen prisoners have stated to one of my staff that Longstreet led the attack on me. Severall colors were captured to-day, and I don't know how many more may turn up.

Major-General, Commanding.

MAY 6-6.45 p.m.

General HUMPHREYS,

GENERAL: Have just captured a rebel prisoner, who says he belongs to A. P. Hill's corps. Does not know whether the whole corps is following or not. It may be doing so. I have sent for Barlow, and if you have nothing down there I should like to have Gibbon.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK.

Major-General, Commanding.

The prisoner says that he belongs to Mahone's brigade, of Hill's corps, and that after a fait attack they moved more to the left-whether to attack Gibbon or envelope me I do not know.

MAY 6, 1864-7.15 p.m

General HUMPHREYS:

There is no doubt that Hill's corps is enveloping me. I have a line of rifle-pits from the right of the Brock road covering the right, around to the Catharpin road. Line well built. I have just been around there. The pits are well filled and the men well prepared.
