General HUMPHREYS:

Do you think the fort on the Norfolk road had better be occupied? General Mott tells me that he has been appointed a brevet major-general to date from September 9, 1864. He is at a loss to know who made him.

The commanding general thinks you had better send some infantry to the redoubt on the Norfolk road, say half a brigade and a battery of artillery.

General Davies has moved all his available cavalry down the plank road to intercept Hampton's cavalry on its return. The commanding general directs that you send a strong brigade with a battery of artillery down the plank road to the fork of the road leading to Reams' Station to cover the flank and rear of the cavalry during the operation. The troops you send will withdraw to their former camp as soon as the cavalry returns.
