have, been made,, whether they have been held-in
t|ie identical moneys originally deposited, and
whether the drafts drawn upon these deposits
have been paid out of, and the balances remain-
ing exist m, the very moneys originally deposited,
and none other. The answer to these queries
will serve to test the truíe chaiacter of the Secre-
jtry's special deposits, arid, unless I am greatly
Received, will prove them to be nothing but a de-
lusive play upon words
„ in reviewing the list of the different public de-
positories, contained in the annual repoit of the
^ecietary of the Treasury, this singular and strik-
ing state of things appears: that while the sub-
Treasury system is still urged upon us, and the
Secretary of the Treasury has,in the existing con-
dition of things, full discretion to dnect the keep-
ing of the public moneys as he thinks best, of an
aggregate of public moneys in the possession of
all the different depositories, amounting to the sum
of $4,599,3Q0, the sum of $2,879,665 is deposited
in banks, $1,320,827 in the four mints, and the
«urn of $398,81 S only at present in the hands of
collectors and receive! s Could there be a stronger
testimony than thisinvoluntarytnbuteon the pan
of the Secretary of the Treasury to the supeuor
safety and convenience of banks as public depos-
itónos > Of the sum of $2,879,665 deposited in the
banks, 295,114 only is deposited in banks em-
ployed undei the piovisions of the act of 1836
The balance, to wit, $3.584,451, is deposiled in
banks employed at the discietion of the Tieasuiy
Department,and, of that, #1,738,488 in the Bank
of the United States alone
The practice of the Executive, then,even while
piofessing to have adopted the sub Tieasuiy sys-
tem, aJTbids the most implicit recognition of the
supeuor value and advantages of banks as depos-
Uoues and fiscal agents They dcpiecatc, it is
tiue, a connection with banks, but it is a legal
connection, sanctioned and íegulatcd by law, it
stems, which they depiecate, not one dipending
on Executive disciuion. Not only the piacticc
of the Administration, but the expiess language
both of the Piesident and Secietaiy of the Ticas
ni v,recognizes the high, and, in the present con
dition of the commciual woild, I might add, al
most indispensable utility of bank ngemy in the
fisial operations of the Government but tiny aie
for leaving the ( mployment of banks to the will
and discietion of the adminisdatois of the Gov-
ernment. The Seen lary of the Tieasury, while
leasonmg in favoi of his sub Ticauury scheme,
eays:
' An appiopmtc and occtsionil use wuuld "till lie made
ofthe bulks by the. lunsury is is done bv otliti«, when
ever convr uincc should requue it Rut n< ithcr piny would
bo lo'eed into a species ol vassali„'e—i constant, neccs
sary, and dependent connection, ' &.c
The President, in his message, taking up the
same idea, says
" Ilanks, liki other State establishments, may be used or
not, in conducting the liTurb ol the <.o\i rninent ns pul lie
policy and [he genu U intercuts ol tile Union nmv si tin to
require 'J he only sale or propei principle upon which their
intercourse with the Govcimm ni c in be rigulatcdls 111 it
which regul lies their inn icourse Willi the pnv lit r?m/cn—

banks tlun without it bhould be ar libeity to seek th u aid
as it would llie services of a private banker, or othi r cipi
tali is or agmts, giving tin pieference to tbo:,e who will
serve it on the best teuns "
It seems, then, that the Secretary of the Treas-
ury and the Piesident aie by no means against
the employment of banks, but they are against
tying up the hands of Executive discretion in
their employment "An appropnate and occa-
sional use may be made of them by the Tieasu
ry,' says the Secretary, " whenevei convenience
should requue it " "Ihey may be used or not,"
repeats the President, " as public policy and the
geneial interests of the Union may seem to re-
quire," anü " tbe Government should be left at
liberty to seek their aid as it would the services
of a private banker," &c Who, I would ask,
under this system, would be the judge when
" convenience," to use the language of the Sec-
retary, or " public policy," according to that of
the President, required the use of banks> Of no
cessity, the Executive—the Department charged
with conducting the " financial operations" of the
Government
Now, with due deference, I must be permuted
to say, Mr. President, that of all the systems yet
suggested for conducting the finances of the coun-
try, ¿his, to my romdjjs, fraught with, the deep-
est dangers to the public liberty. What, sir!
banks " to be used, or not," as fiscal agents, ac-
cording as the President and Secretary of the
Treasuiy may determine it to be useful, politic,
or convenient to do so! The consequence would
necessarily be to put all the monejedinstitutions
qf the country under the power and at the devo-
tion of the Executive. No i ule of law being estab-
lished legulaung tbe employment of banks—no
limit fixed to the number which might be em-
ployed, or terms prescribed on which they should
be employed, as one might be employed to-day
and another to morrow, as those already em-
ployed might be dismissed, and new ones taken
into the service of the Government, at the sole
will and pleasuie of the Executive—what would
this be bu,t to convert the whole community of
banks into suitors for Executive favor, and to
sub]ect them to the dominion of Executive powei>
Under this system, if the Executive so willed it,
the sub-Treasmy scheme might be carried out,
in one section of the country, with all its deso-
lating exactions of specie, luns upon the banks,
&c , while, in anoihei, banks would be the fa
voied agents of the Government, and, through
them, eveiy facility be given to the opeiations of
mdustiy and trade What would this be, I again
ask, but to cieate in the hands of the Executive
a powei absolutely despotic over the pecuniary
concerns of the people' It would give to the Ex-
ecutive not merely that " exclusive custody and
entne control of the public moneys" which is the
gieat end of the sub-Tieasuiy scheme, but it
would invest them with a sweeping dominion over
the wholi ol the moneyed institutions of the coun-
tiy To so feaiful an accumulation of powei in
the hands of a depaitment of the Government
whose patronage and influence have already
pioved an oveimatch for the Representatives of
the people and the Slates, and, I sometimes fear,
foi the people and the States themselves, I, for
one, will never consent No, sn, if hanks aie
the safest d< positones and bestfiscal agents of the
Government, as I believe them to be, and as the
piacliec, and in a gieat degiee the language, of
the Admmislialion, admit them to be, let their
eniploynn nt be legulated by law, let the number
to be employed be limited by law, let the teims
and conditions on which ihey aie to be employed,
the manner of their selection, and the services
they aie to ptifoun, be all defined bylaw, let the
power of the Executive over them be stuuly
guarded by a legislative dcclaiation of the sole
causes foi which, when once employed, they
shall be discontinued, and leqiinuig, in eveiy
such case, a piompt leport to Congiess of the
special íeasons of the discontinuance In so grave
and important a tiustas the care and management
of the public tieasuie—one, too, so peculiarly the
piovmce of the legislative depaitment to supei-
vise, and which, in all countnes, is felt to be so
intiinutely connected with the public libeity— let
us leave nothing to Executive discietion which
can be defined and icgulated by law
The piogiessof tlusgiett fin incial contiotersy
has, as it seems to me, Mr President, at length
biought us to this single issue—a giave and poi-
tentous one it most assuredly is, but yet simple
and disembauassed lhat the State banks are
to be employed as fiscal agents of the Govern-
ment is, as I have shown, admitted both by the
piactice and language of the Administration
The only question is, how and in what manner
they are to be employed > Are they to be em-
ployed at the sole will and pleasure of the Exec-
utive, or are they tobe employed under the sine
Hon, limitations, and responsibility of law? The
sub-Tieasuiy scheme,though stilhecommended,
and even earnestly íecommended in name, and
intended, possibly, to be pressed in fact, is vir-
tually abandoned in aigument The objections
taken to it by its opponents have, one by one,
been piactically admitted, not only by the puolic
I reason, which has emphatically pionounced its
condemnation of the scheme, but by the Aelmin-
I istration itself     The great and vital pnnciple of
j the system is the collection of the levenuem hard
money   This, accordingly, was putfni ward most
I prominently in the message of the Piesident at
the extra session of Congress, and was urged by
fain} Wjith peculiar earnestness The legislative
discussion, during that session, it will be recol-
lected by all of we, turned mainly or  that funda-
mental principle of the system. It Was found to
be untenable in the open field of argument, and
accordingly we have heard nothing more of it in
either ot the two subsequent messages of the
Piesident, or annual repents of the Seeietaiy of
the Treasury.
The next great question on which issue was
joined between the advocates antj the opponents
of the sub-Treasury scheme was the comparative
safety of the; banks and of public officers, as de-
positories of the public money. Notwithstanding
the tuumphant appeal we made to the pastexpe-
rience of the Government on this head, and the
vast amount of losses which we showed, by the
authentic íecords of the Treasury had been sus-
tained fiom defaulting public officers, it was still
contended that banks were less safe than indi-
vidual agents, and reports were called forth from
the Secretary of the Treasury, -explaining away
the conclusive testimony of his former reports,
and making out, by cei tain recondite caleulations
of interest and of alleged depreciation, a heavy
loss in figures (though not in fact), against the
banks, to offset the enoimous defaults of public
ofliceis But what does tbe Secretaiy now say
under the teachings of" recent events/'oi) review-
ing his repoits both, foi and against the compara-
tive safety ofbanksaspublicdepositories' "Bank-
ing institutions have nevei been regarded by the
undeisigned" (says Mi Woodbury in his late
animal repoit to Congiess) " as a class of agents
generally unsafe, when looking to eventual losses,"
oi, as he says in another part of his report, " in
relation to eventual payment." 1 should like to
know fiom Mr. Woodbury what prospect of
" eventual payment" he has fiom the sub-Treas-
ureiswho have recently fled the country, and put
the ocean between them and the Solicitor of the
Treasury.
In like manner,the President bears, in my opin-
ion, the most impressive testimony to the superior
safety of banks as depositories, by the extraor
dinary and unusual provisions he recommends
tnguaid against the defalcations of public officers
He e\piessly says, indeed, that " the expenencft
of every country has shown that public officers
are not at all times pioof against temptation "
To countervail the foice of this temptation, he
invokes the penal legislation of CongrebS to
" visit" the infidelity of these agents " with se-
vere and ignominious punishment." But of what
a-vail would be even the bloody code of Draco,
when the impioved methods of locomotion to
which the entei prising and inventive genius of the
age has given bnth,and of which two of our
sub Tieasuiers have aheady availed themselves,
afibid so leady a means of escape, and of conse-
quent impunity, under a foreign ]uusdiction ' Far
bettei would it be, in my humble judgment, to
heed the piayei which Divine wisdom has taught
to human weakness, and to " lead not" public
officers (who are but men) into "temptation,"
by committing to their custody large sums of the
public treasuie
But the Piesident, as if conscious that neither
the ngors of legislative enactment, noi the vigi-
lance of Executive supervision, could adequately
provide for the safety of the public moneys in the
hands of individual agents, has gravely submitted
to Congress a proposition which, I must with all
defeience say, appeals to me the most extraoidi-
nary on record,and utterly opposed to the spun
at least of the Constitution What is it? Why,
that Congress shouldappoint an ambulatory com-
mittee of their own body to look after the Piesi-
dent's sub Tieasurers, to make "fiequent exam-
inations of their affairs arid accounts," of which
these officers, the Piesident adds, " should have
no previous notice," and then to "report to the
Executive such defalcations as are found to ex-
ist " Yes, sir, a committee of Congress to hunt
up defaulters, and repoit them to the Executive!
Whose duty is it, I would ask, under the Con-
stitution, to supeivise and inspect the conduct of
public ofliceis? "The Executive power," by
the Constitution, is expressly "vested in the
President." He appoints the public officers, who
are his agents and assistants in the performance
