under the cessions, are held in full and absolute
right, discharged from all conditions except those
specific ones expressly reserved in the acts of
cession, while,if held byonginal title, the fourth
article of the Constitution empowers Congress to
dispose of them, with no other limitation than
such as may be imposed by the sense of public
duty and the general welfare     Again
" Ijike all other public proper'y, these lands are indeed
held as a trust fnr the common benefit of the States, or
rather of the people of the United States, but of the mode
of administering tins common fund, and the objects to
which it shall be applied, Congress alone is entitled to
judge "
New York, therefore, so far from denying the
power of Congress to distribute to all in just pro-
portions, necessarily asserted it, in maintaining
the still broader power to make any and every
disposition not incompatible with the deeds of
cession or the public welfare.
Connecticut, without impeaching the donations
to the new States, argued in favor of an allotment
to the old States, also for the purpose of educa
Hon Still more recently, as lately as May, 1838,
her Legislature has distinctly asserted the prin-
ciple of distribution, and requested her Repre-
sentatives in Congress to use their best endeav-
ors to have it practically adopted I request the
Clerk to read them for the information of the
House
The resolutions were read as follows.
Resolutions of Connecticut relating to the disposition of the
public lands of the United States, at a General .Assembly
of the State of Connecticut, holden at Neil Hat en, m said
htatc,on the first Wednesday of May, Ji J) 1838
"Resolved I y this Jlsseml lit 1 hit the public lands belong
in;; to l'ie thill* d butts ire Ihe common property of all the
State*, and the proteeds of them should be appioprmted to
their use and benefit, and to no other purpose whatever,
without the consent of the States respectively
"Resolved, I hat this General Assembly do solemnly pro
teat «n untt a cession of any ot the public Inmls to a ¡ante
In which they may be situated, at a puce legs' than that at
which they are offered in maiitet, and also against all pre
emptioti laws, and the grants made under the authority of
men taws
' Resolved by this assembly, That our Senators and Kep
rescntatives m Congress be requested to use their hi it en
deavors to have the proceeds of the public lands divided
among the states severally, as soon as it can with propriety
be done
"KesoUccíjThatítiscípciliciit tinta portion of tin public
lands b( longing to the Hinted States should be ippropiintui
to the support of education in the onh nil tliutocil St ites
of the union, and tlint tin be iintors and Ki prtsontatives in
Congress from this Mali be requested to procuie tin ad >p

"Rctaliel Ai/fni* Jlssembly, That Ins Vxi i llency the Gov
ernor be requested to lorwnrti a copyot thisc resolutions to
each ot our ¡Senators and Uepresentntivi s in Congress, and
also to c tell Ljcctuuve ot the scvoial ¡Mates, with a request
that they nny be laid before tin Ijt^ialatuies of their Slates
respectively "
Mr ROBERTSON. These resolutions have
been laid before the LegislatuieofVirgmia They
aie not, I think, on the Journals of either House
of Congicss
Mr 1JN GUAM said he believed they had never
been transmitted by the Governor to the Repie-
sentatives of the State
Mr ROBERTSON I could account for the
omission, sn, in no other way The gentlemen
an welcome, however, to my copy, if they think
pioper to accept it. I trust they will sptead it
upon our Journal, and that I shall have then co-
operation in endeavoring to carry into effect the
wishes of their native State
The principle of distribution has been asseited
by Massachusetts, and her Representatives re-
quested, in 183b, to carry it into piactice, by
suppoitmg what is commonly called Clay's land
bill
The Senators and Represen'atives of Louisiana
voted for the same bill, fiom which I infei it was
acceptable to that Slate.
In February last, the Legislature of Ohio de-
nounced the policy of abandoning the public lands
to be sold piecemeal, and permitting the money
to be used aa common revenue, as treacherous
and injurious to the States, and declared that,
" after the payment of the public debt; the pro-
ceeds of the public lands belonged of right to the
States," and that Congress was bound " to dis
tnbute the same, according to the deeds of ces-
sion "
Still more recently, North Carolina has sent
us íesolutions quite as strong as those of Mary-
land.
The attention of Virginia was called by the
Public Lands—Mr. Robertson.
Governor to this mteiesting subject at the com-
mencement of the present session of her Legis-
lature His message vindicates the right of the
old States to a just participation in the common
fund, and the House of Delegates, by a unani-
mous vote, has concurred in asserting it, and
by a decided majority demanded a distribution
Thei- resolutions are now before the Senate I
know not how that branch of her Legislature
may decide, nor will its decision, be it what it
may, change the settled conviction of my mind
that a vast majority of the people of Virginia
will sustain the position taken by their Governor
and then more immediate Representatives
The resolutions were read by the Cleik, at the
request of Mr RoBERrsON.
The resolutions on the subjeet of the public lands, as finally
adopted by the House of Delegates

ti aniiml tin foregoing report and resolutions to eacti of the
Senators and Ri prescntatives in Congress from this State,
with a request that the same be laid before the two Houses

"9 ResoUel, That the Governor be requested to com
mmucate a copy of said preamble and n solutions to the
Ftecuuve of each State in this Union, with i request to
submit the same to their respective Xjegislatuircs "
The State of South Carolina, so far as I have
been able to find, has expressed no opinion upon
thissubject But the propositions lately piesent-
ed by the Representatives from that ¡state, and
now supported by those fiom Arkansas, and
which 1 shall have occasion to bring more partic-
ularly to the notice of the House, necessarily con-
cede the power to distribute
Thus, sir, I have enumerated nineteen States
out of the twenty-six which have asserted or ad-
mitted the constitutional power of Congress to
apportion the proceeds of the public lands among
all the States
In regard to Georgia, I entertain no more doubt
o." her wishes than I do of those of my own State,
and very littte more doubt of them than of my
own existence * Indeed, sir, the proposition of-
fered at the last session by the gentleman from
Georgia, [Mr Havnfs,] who nowseems opposed
* Georgia nev er ceded her lands till 1802 Among other
stipulations in her cession was one limost precisely sum
lar to that quoted from the compact with Virginia , and an
other declaring that in a certain event the cession should
be void, and the lands revert to Georgia
Ho. op Reps.
to all manner of distribution, left me under the
belief that he himself approved it, provided it was
made among individuals, instead of States
Mr HAYNES Did I notiemark to the gen-
tleman from Virginia that I offered my resolution
only as an alternative in case any distribution
should prevail?
Mr ROBERTSON. The gentleman so stated
to me a few days ago. I do not íecollect that he
ever said so during the last session My impres-
sion is directly the reverse, and it was with un-
feigned surprise that I hcai d the gentleman's prop-
osition in committee, declaring it inexpedient, aa
I understood it, now or at any future time, to
divide the lands, or their proceeds, either among
States or individuals Add Geoigia, and you
have twenty out of the twenty-six States, with
a representation in the Senate of foity out of fifty-
two, and in this House of two hundied and twen-
ty-two out of two hundied and forty two mem-
bers'
Of the remaining six States—Alabama, Missis-
sippi, Indiana, Illinois, Missoun, and Michigan—
three only, those I have last mentioned, having a
repiesentalion in this House of six members only,
and an equal number in the Senate, would piob-
ably have even a pecumaiy inti rest in opposing
a just division, or would senously oppose it
And yet wo hear it boastingly said that the new
States will before long dictate their own teims,
and wiite them on the face of the bill as the law
of the land
It has been intimated that New Ilampshne and
Ohio have changed then views and opinions; Sir,
it does not follow, because New Hampshire has
disapproved a division of the surplus revenue,
that she opposes the distiibtition she formeily
demanded of the proceeds of the public lands,
noi that Ohio has given up the i ighfs she so lately
pioclaimed it tiencheiy to abandon, because she
has changed her political complexion I confess,
su, I am incredulous on this point I must see
somi action of the Lcgislatuie or the people be
foic I can believe it If it be so, however, I
should be uluctint to force this measure upon
them, and will cheufully vote foran amendment,
il their Representatives will propose it, declanng
that those States, or any others oppostd to its
constitutionality, shall not be compelli d to jiartici-
pate But the ground assumed for Ohio, it must
be remarked, will, beyond dispute, give us the
support of New York, Georgia, and Connecticut,
whose political sentiments have also undergone
a change, but in a diffent direction
Supposing the six States I have mentioned,
having together but twenty Representatives on
this floor, to be all opposed to the principle of
distribution, and adding to them all the States
regarded as doubtful, tneie will still remain in
Us favor an overwhelming majority, having a rep-
resentation four or five times greatei, and a coi-
lesponding superiority of population
1 proceed to adduce other aiguments, Mr
Speaker, in support of the proposed measure,
drawn from the piacticit legislation of the coun-
tiy, and the opinions of men high in authouty
The authority of great names will have more in-
fluence, I know, than any argument of mine
General Jackson, in 1829------
Mr PICKENS Do you quote General Jack-
son as authouty'
Mr ROBERTSON Not for himself, sir, but
foi the party of w hich he was the leader
Mr PICKENS. You do not call him the
leader'
Mr ROBERTSON     I do, sir, the acknowl-
edged, the undoubted leadei, and among his fol-
lowers were some as abject and servile as those
of the eastern monarch, who wcie ready, when
his Majesty said ltwas night at noonday, to look
up to the sun, and sweai they saw the moon and
stars     In his first message to Congress, General
Jackson, then ficsh fiom the people, looking for-
ward to alarge surplus in the Tieasurj , and dep
recating the injustice and discord which would
probably ensue fiom  using it for internal  lm
piovemcnt, íecommended an apportionment of
such suiplus " among the several States accoid
mg to their ratio of lepiesentation "   This ap
poitionment he declared as, in his  opinion, the
most safe, just, and fedeial disposition which
could be made of it, and this opinion he delib-
