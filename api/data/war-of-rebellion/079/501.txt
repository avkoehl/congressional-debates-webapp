cars at Wauhatchie and move on with the other two toward Bridgeport, putting a second DIVISION on the cars at Whiteside trestle or at Bridgeport, whichever point the trains overtake you. If you want provisions your commissary will have to get them in Chattanooga and let them follow on after you. Your wagon train can follow you by the road, under the escort of a brigade. Report your arrival at Wauthatchie, Whiteside's, and Bridgeport.

Major-General THOMAS:

Upon leaving Gaylesville, after a consultation with General Sherman, I marched only one brigade, via Valley Head, General Grose, of the Second DIVISION. The remainder of the corps I marched via Alpine, La Fayette, &amp;c., and it will encamp near Rossville to- night. Grose will be at Trenton to-night and Shellmound to-morrow night. The corps will be at Bridgeport, and I will try and cross the whole infantry force on Monday. I will remain here till 9 a. m. to-morrow. My train, which was at Rome when I started, has joined me.

Major-General STANLEY,

Chattanooga:

See Mr. Tindall, superintendent of railroad at Chattanooga, and arrange with him to dispatch as much of your corps by cars to- morrow as he can for Athens, Ala., to be followed by the remainder as rapidly as possible. Perhaps you can make better speed by marching one DIVISION and sending the others by rail. On arriving at Athens, Ala., proceed at once to Pulaski, unless you learn that the enemy has not crossed the Tennessee.

Major-General THOMAS:

I will start General Wood's DIVISION for Huntsville per railroad early to-morrow morning and will push the rest of the infantry on as soon after-ward as possible. I have consulted with Major-General Steedman and Mr. Tindall and they think time can be saved by loading all the troops here.
