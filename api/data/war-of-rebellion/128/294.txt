GENERAL ORDERS, ADJT. AND INSP. GENERAL'S OFFICE, No. 1. Richmond, January 3, 1863.

I. The following orders are published for the information of the Army:

All white male citizens of the Confederate States between the ages of eighteen and forty who are not exempt by the act of October 11, 1862, are liable to conscription; and all such as have been already enrolled and mustered will be held as though in service of the Confederate States, until, otherwise ordered. Exemption will not take place until after enrollment, when enrolling officers will grant certificates of exemption in all cases clearly within the meaning of the act. All doubtful cases for exemption will be referred for decision to commandants of camps of instruction, and, if necessary, by them to the chief of the Bureau of Conscription in Richmond. Such cases will not be required to report in person to the camp of instruction until final action is had on the same.

II. Enrolling officers are required to be vigilant in the discharge of their duties within the district confided to them, not only in respect to the enrollment of conscripts, but also in the apprehension and arrest of stragglers and deserters from the Army. Complaints having been made of harsh treatment to conscript by enrolling officers in certain localities, which treatment is calculated to prejudice the cause of the Confederate States, by encouraging opposition to the acts of conscription, it will be the duty of commandants of camps of instruction to report to the Secretary of War, for discharge from conscript service, any officer who shall offend in this particular. It is required of all enrolling officers to encourage and promote a good understanding with the people of the district in which they may be serving; and it is impressed on them that firmness of purpose, tempered with kindness and forbearance, will best promote the objects to be attained.
