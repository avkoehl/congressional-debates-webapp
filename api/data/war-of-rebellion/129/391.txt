In illustration of our views, we will add, that a horse with only one eye sound might, in all respects, be classed as a first-class artillery horse, yet the loss of one eye would justly and considerably curtail his value. So a horse from ten to eighteen years of age might be deemed in all other particulars as a first-class artillery horse, but of course, however efficient or able to render good service for a year or so, yet his advanced age would justly and materially impair his value. Any horse, however he may approximate the standard of a first-class artillery horse, must, according to deficiencies, fall below the maximum price; and as few comparatively come up to the standard, and therefore are entitled to the maximum price, so of course in all other instances the price should be proportionately reduced, as imperfections place them below the standard of first class, &amp;c.

REVISION OF THE SCHEDULE OF FEBRUARY AND MARCH LAST.

Since the adoption of our last schedule for the months of February and March The financial bills passed by Congress, taxing the currency, have seriously impaired the value of the old issues of Confederate Treasury notes. At this juncture large numbers of horses and mules were impressed and paid for in a currency which was in a few days thereafter to be taxed 33 1/3 per cent.

The Board of State Commissioners having adjourned, and one of its members being out of the State, it could not be convened in time to review our schedules of prices. Under this state of facts we have re-examined and rearranged our tariff of prices, so far as we have been advised of recent impressments, proposing in this mode, to remedy any diminution of valuation which may have resulted from the action of Congress upon the currency. Therefore we assess the average value of artillery or wagon horses or mules, impressed since the passage of the currency bill of the 17th of February last, at $600. This award will entitle each person to receive higher compensation accordingly as each horse or mule recently impressed may be considered as being a first, second, or third class artillery or wagon horse or mule, whether the parties appeal to our Board or not; and the impressing agents and officers should forthwith call on all of those persons of whom they impressed horses or mules and propose a settlement upon the foregoing basis, but allowing to each person only such prices as first, second, and third class artillery or wagon horses or mules may be estimated at, assuming our average appraisement of $600 as a fair medium valuation. This, then, would allow a maximum price of $800, and a minimum price of $400, making $600 the average price-thus allowing more for first-class horses or mules and proportionately less
