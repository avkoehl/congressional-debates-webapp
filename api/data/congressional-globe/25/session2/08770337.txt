25th Cong""2hp Bess.______________liemoval of the Treasury Building.—Mr. Lincoln.                                               H. of Reps.
their service by some previous reputation, and had
received several special engagements, with the ap-
probation of the House, m repairs upon the Capi-
tol, and part cularly in the alterations of this Hall
With such tebtimonials of qualification, he pre-
sented himself for the appointment. What repre-
sentations he made to induce to the adoption of his
plan of building, or to commit to his discretion the
arrangement and construction of the edifice, the
committee had no means of being informed The
result only of his application is known m Ihe brief
letter of authority which has just been read at the
Clerk's table, the evidence at once, as is seen, of
the appointment of the architect, the designation of
the site, and the plan of construction, upon the op-
portunity for inquiry and examination afforded by
a single intervening day between the passage of the
law, and the performance of the Executive trust in
all these particulars.
But, sir, I have said, I impute no fault to the late
President ol the United States for this seeming pre-
cipitancy of action He had reason to believe the
architect previously employed by the authority of
the House "honest and capable," and with the
sustaining recommendations which he exhibited of
sufficient skill and experience fot the task He
might well also rely, that one who should be ap-
pointed to carry into effect the design of Congress
would adopt, as a guide to his conduct, the plan
which received the preference of the committee,
and had at least the tacit approval of the House
The site also was indicated in the law, by the men-
tion of its proximity to the old Treasury budding,
unless a preference should be given to some other
place Besides, it is again to be regarded that the
President was, at this time, worn don n by the la-
bors and confinement attendant upon a protracted
session of Congreso, and the weakness and lnfrrm
ty of impaired health, and within a lew daj s left
the city for that relaxation from arduous duties
which had become necessary to the restoration of
exhausted strength The necessary application to
the more important business of the nation upon his
return, immediately preceding the following session
of Congees?, and his subsequent severe and con-
tinued sickness, precluded all further attention, and
doubtless the bestowment of any thought upon the
subject until the close of his term of office, on the
4th of March of the last year In the meantime
the work of construction had been commenced by
the architect, the position of the building had been
fixed, and its foundations laid, and the structure
was rising to view To whatever objectionitmight
now have been exposed, there seemed no power
for interposition It is understood that representa-
tions weie made to the present Executive unfavo-
rable to the sue and plan of the work But the
offi eof the law had been already lulfihed m these
particulars He rightly deemed that it was not
within his province to change the location once de-
termined upon, or to interfere with a plan oí con-
struction supposed to have been appri /ed bv h s
predecessor in office, and the build ng has thus been
suffered to proceed
Mr Chairman, [continued Mr L ]Ihavethougnt
it not irrelevant to present the cucuinstances undei
which the architect was appointed, and the site
and plan of the building were designated, to pre-
clude any misapprehension of the personal appli-
cation of the objections which the committee have
urged to the design and execution of the work
Sir, I should deprecate the excitement of party feel-
ing from a supposed implication of the conduct,
either m act or neglect, of the late or present Ex-
ecutive m this matter. This is no party affair
The report of the committee, now upon your ta-
ble, has the unanimous consent of gentlemen of buth
political parties, a majority of them the friends of
the Administration It truly presents, with the
bill, the result of the deliberations of many weeks,
most laboriously and faithfully devoted to the ex-
amination of the subject, and is entitled to all the
confidence which patient inquiry and impartial
judgment, with whatever capacity the committee
po sess, may claim It is to be borne m mind also
that it is not the wsrk of the committee of this
House only Under a resolution of the other
branch, concurred in here, we have brought to our
aid the consentaneous advioe and opinions of a
22
committee of that body Again I say, therefore,
this is no partj matter, and the indications abroad
or in this House that it may be made so, are to be
received with no sentiments but of reproof an 1 re-
gret For myself, I shall continue to treat the sud-
jest, as I have hitherto regarded it, as one of busi-
ness meiely, a transaction having relation to pro-
perly, aside from polities, in which the Adminis-
tration and those who oppose it have a like con-
cern, under the law, to see that the Government
obtain those accommodations which convenience
and the public interest have demanded I full well
know that it is a dry and uninviting topie, but I
would fain hope for that attention to it from this
committee which its bearing upon the Treasury and
its importance to the country should secure
I proceed now to consider the obj cioiw to the
bu Idm?, and to show where and xmlh whom the re-
sponse lity lies fo1- its defects The report wh di
accompanies the bill points to the position of the
building, the plan of Us construction, and the inse-
curity of the work, for the former, and to the archi-
tect appointed by the President, tor the latter In
the judgment of the committee, wit's the architect,
and with him. alone, rests Me fault fot whatever
cause of complaint justly exists And here, let me
remark that, in arriving at this conclusion, no un-
favorable bias preoccupied the minds of the mem-
bers, to the prejudice of Mr Mills Fex myself, I
may truly say, that my prepossessions had been
altogether in his favor, and, throughout the whole
process of irqmrj and examination by thecommit-
tee, he was uniformly treated with a delicacy and
teiderness towards his feelings and professional
reputation, but ill requited in the extraordinary ap-
peal w hich he has thought Broper to prefer It is
now made painfully my autv, in discussing the
principal subject, to connecf with it an exposition
of the incapacity or misconduct of the architect, ior
either the committee are w! oily unjustified in their
report, or to one or both of tnese causes are to be
ascribed the errors of which they complain
On the very threshold of their inquiries, the at-
tention of the committee was directed to the actual
position of Ihe new Treasury building, m reference
to the site They saw that, with a greatly extended
fiont, it was placed on an inclined plane of rapid
elevation, and so protruded upon the line of the
contiguous street, as to adtmt of no relief to the
unequal height of the base, and an inconvenient
access to the rooms Moreover, it was biought,
with its unfinished walls, i íto such near proximity
to the office of the present State Department, as to
indicate a design in the architect, if not to create a
necessity, for the removal anl destruction of that
edifice An examination oi the interior arrange-
ment of the struc ure suggested objections to the
passige ways, and to the imperfect light which
could be received into parts of the building It w as
upon such observa icns, Mr Chairman, that the
architect was first cal'"d upon to exp'am the plan
of his w ork Sir, it is proper I should state that it
w as lus inability to do this in a satisfactory manner,
which mduoed to subsequent and more critical in-
quines into the matter When asked the occasion
ior precipitating the building to |the line of the
street, and carrying the unfinished walls to the side
of the building occupied by the State Department,
his excuse w as, theposUiot command of General Jack-
son tópeseme the building of the State Department,
and the necessity, theiefoie, of conforming the
walls to the position of the old edifice, with a v lew
of connecting them with it When it was pointed
out to him that this object had not been regarded,
inasmuch as the line of colonnade of the new struc-
ture was several feet in advance, while the princi-
pal wall receded as far from the front line of the
building, hto reply was, that the front of the old ¡
building was to be cut off, and the colonnade ex-
tended It was then suggested to him that this
would necessarily occasion the destruction of all
the front rooms of that building He said the front
rooms must be taken away When asked how he
wou'd disp ise of the chimnej s in that case, his
reply was, thev must b  taken down also. It was
remarked to him, by the committee, that the win-
dows of the State Department did not correspond
with those of the new building, his answer was,
they must be altered and made to conform.   It was
further objected, that the buildings were of different
number and height of stones, that the floors were
not on tne same level, 'hat the passage wajs dd
not coincide, and would not admit of communica-
tions with each other, and now it was that tne
architect admitted for the first time, that there
could be no conformity short of an entire change in
the interior, and mostly so of the exterior structure
of the old bnilding, and it might be best to take it
entirely away. Tnus, the new building had been
forced into an inconvenient and improper position,
and arranged upon an objectionable plan of con-
struction, under the pretext of respect to a mandate
to preserve the old, while the destruction of the old
had now become the preferable mode te the com-
pletion of the new. Sir, upon this exhibition of
the reasoning and conduct of the architect, the
committee did, indeed, entertain distrust of his
judgment and fidelity The commission in his
hands gave no warrant for such an arrangement,
either in the position or plan ot the new Treasury
building, and I will show that, neither in the one
nor the other, has he the sanction or the aafhoijtty
of General Jackson
The law requires that the President "cause to
be erected, on or near the site of the former Trea-
sury building, or any other public lot he may select,
a fire proof buildng," &e la the only paper signed
by General Jackson on the subject, that of 6th
July, 183C, which has been read, and which is both
the evidence of the execution of his duty in the
designation of the site, and his authority to the
architect to engage m the construction of the work,
he directs in so many terms, that the Treasury
building be erected "on the old site" In con-
connection with this, we have the word of the
architect himself that he was specially enjoined to
preserve the State Department Indeed, the instruc-
tions could not have been otherwise, nor in the
absence of instructions, could any other interpre-
tation have been giv en to the law This latter
building was comparatively new It had been
erected since the last war with Great Britain, of
durable materials, in a substantial manner, and at
a cost exceeding the mm of one hundred and thirty
thousand dollars The reference bj the President
for tne site of the new build rg was to the old Trea-
sury, and, by enjommg the preservation o! the
State Department, he, m effect, prohibited all in-
terference with it Sir, whatever may be the pre-
tence that the President approved or understood
the present position and extent of the new build-
ing, it is utterly inconsistent with the little attention
which he had opportunity to give to the subject,
and repugnant alike to his written designaron ot
the sit , and his more exphct verbal direction to the
architect
Nor is the architect better sustained m the plan
which he is now prosecuting tor the completion of
the building It is not the pian selected by General
Jackson I say this advisedly The plan of pre-
sent execution could not have been the plan of
original design upon which the build ng was au-
thorized to be constructed Does any doubt of
this? Let him b it examine the foundations and
piesent state of the structure, and regard the clear
indications to the necessary mode ot its comp'e-
tion The whole design of the architect is to be
■-een in the draw mg now suspended inthelobov,
benind the bar It presents the elevation of an
edifice of given dimensions, correspond ng with the
front wallsof the present Lmldins:, extended ov er the
site occupied by the State Department and with a
north wing covering the whole found ition of the
latter building It exhibits a corresponding wi g
at the south, and a projection of like proportion m
the centre Such, Mr Chairman, are the outlines
of the plan, and such the sure indications, from the
actually existing state of the vvoik, of the íntea-
tion of the architect to its execution Was such
apian ever approved by the Executive' And,
from the consideiation that it must destroy the
very thing which the late President insisted shou'd
be preserved, (the, btaldmg of the State Depart-
ment,) the committee found, m the explana  on
of the plan given to them b} the architect, a con-
clusive fact against the possibility of there having
been such approval Upon inquiry into the de-
signs upon the drawing of th« south wing of th«
