and 160 in Jamestown, Tenn. They are killing and robbing as they go. They threatened this place, and say the stores, &amp;c., left here shall be destroyed. The loyal citizens of Clinton are almost in despair, &c.

My command, already reduced by sending the Forty-ninth Indiana Regiment to Barboursville, is too small to afford succor to Somerset. Assistant Quartermaster McKinney belongs to my division, and I have ordered him to supply the Home Guard with arms and ammunition, and destroy the balance of the stores on the approach of the enemy. Duplicate sent to General Buell.

BARSBOURVILLE, KY., June 9, 1862.

Many thanks for Baird and Medary. Both have arrived. My advance guard is at Lambdin's, within 18 miles of Speedwell, where the column will strike the Tennessee line. For miles a road had to be constructed as the column advanced, and the guns could only be drawn up the Pine Mountain by the aid of block and tackle. The rear of the column is 3 miles beyond Cumberland Ford, and on Thursday the entire force will be concentrated on the Cumberland Mountains. The obstacles are great, but will be overcome. With my staff left Cumberland Ford at 3 p.m. on yesterday, and in order to go forward rapidly I have avoided line of march, and will be at the head of the column to-day.

HDQRS. SEVENTH DIVISION, ARMY OF THE OHIO,Cumberland Gap, June 19, 1862.

The enemy evacuated this American Gibraltar this morning at 10 o'clock, and De Courcy's brigade took possession at 3 this afternoon. The enemy destroyed a considerable amount of his stores, and precipitated several cannon over the cliffs, spiking others, and carried a few away. I believe,however, that seven have been found in position. The tents were left standing, but cut into slits. He had not time to destroy or take a portion of his stores,and they have been taken possession of by the proper officers. The Stars and Stripes were raised by De Courcy, and a national salute was fired in honor of the capture of this stronghold of treason. Each brigade, in the order of its arrival, will on successive days plant its flag at sunset upon the pinnacle of the mountain, accompanied by a national salute.

In my hurried dispatches of this morning I neglected speaking in terms of just praise of the valuable services of Lieutenant Fisher and his brother officers of the Signal Corps, and also of the energy and devotion of Lieutenant-Colonel Munday and his handful of cavalry; but every officer and every soldier has nobly discharged his duty.

GEORGE W. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
