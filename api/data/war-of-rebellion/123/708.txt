HARRISBURG, PA., October 31, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Order No. 121 is not clear upon the payment of transportation other than by railroads or steam-boats. In our border counties men had to be transported in wagons and the quartermasters decline paying bills unless further instructed. Please have the order made directing the payment of such bills. They have been transported cheaper than by railroads.

His Excellency Governor SALOMON,

Madison, Wis.:

Drafted men may volunteer for three years or the war into regiments organized previous to July and receive advance pay and bounty, but no premium. Recruits for new regiments cannot receive advance pay and bounty unless the regiments have been reduced in battle.

You are authorized to use the troops in your State when necessary to enforce the draft. Walter D. McIndoe has been appointed provost-marshal for Wisconsin.
