The enemy is not advancing; he is still firing; he has men on foot; cavalry dismounted: nothing serious yet; I can hold out.

AMES,

LATER.-The enemy reported coming in on our left.

MAY 31, 1864.

(Received 8.45 p. m.)

General HINKS:

As nearly as I can make out there is a battalion of cavalry at Livesay's house; a brigade of cavalry in our front in the woods with the skirmish line in the road this side of our usual picket line; a section or perhaps two rifled pieces near the road left of Cedar Grove road. I do not think there is any infantry. They hold on to their advance line obstinately, though driven back several times. They also occupy Broadway and vicinity. I cannot tell the force. Their reconnaissance to the front and right shows about 600 or 700 cavalry. Lady Lincoln is here yet unloaded, the men all being at the front.

AMES,

Colonel.

SIGNAL STATION, May 31, 1864-1.15 p. m.

General BUTLER:

We may need the Twenty-second Regiment. I have ordered Colonel Kiddoo to move to Point of Rocks, and be in readiness to cross if you give him the order. Don't fire from your side at present, as it will endanger our own skirmish line.

DUNCAN,

Colonel.
