Sept. 1837.                      APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
25th Cons.....1st Sess.                                Making public officers depositories—Mr. Nile?.
That act pro; ides that all the public rev enues
shall be deposited in State bank , to be selected by
the Secretary of the Treasury, and that, when the
amount exceeds a certain, sum the banks aie to
pay interest at a certain rate The banks aie also
required, as part compensation for the use of the
public deposites, to perform the duties of pension
agents What are these pnnciples but a proposi-
tion for a compact with the State banks t and
when acceded to by any bank, it becomes a com-
pact between the Government and such bank And
what is the natuie of this compact i Why, fhat
the United Sutes is to become a sort of " partner
in trade" with the deposite hanks It is in fact,
sir, a system nf banking on the fart of the United
States, carried on through the agency of State
banks, that agency resting on contract If an in-
dividual w as to contract with a bank foi the use,
for an indefinite time, of a large sum of money,
to be employed for banking purposes, for which he
was to leeeive either a stipulated inteiest or a cer-
tain share of the general earning of the bank,
would not sue h individual be engaged in the bank-
ing business i Sir, under this deposite bank sys-
tem, the United States, during the yearl83t> was cai
rymgonamore extensive bankmgbusmcss than any
institution m this countrj, as it had between foity
and fifty millions, all emplojed m banking opeia-
tions But not only are the funds of the Government
to be used for loansand discounts, hut they are blend-
ed with those of the deposite banks, and, by this
sort pf political copartnership in banking, the Sec-
retary of the Treasury may acquire, to some ex-
tent, an influence over the general business of tlie
bank, and ov er its own capital, as well as that fur-
nished by the Government
The act contemplates that, by this compact, die
bank is to submit to his supei vision it ispenodi
cally to report to him the state of its affans and
tosubmit to such restrictions and regulations as he
may prescribe so far as he is aothonze 1 to do this
by the act The act also imposes i cstnctions as to
the issuing of small bills on the deposite banks,
"which is virtually modifying their charters
Now, sir, compare the two systems in respect to
their  bearing on Executive influence    the one
makes a small addition to the patronage of the
President, the other not only adds to Executive
patronage, (for the designation of deposite banks
is an item of patronage,) bat it bungs the Govern
ment into direct connexion with the moneyed in
sututions of the country    In some  instances, a
single bank has had be. jral millions of the public
funds, using them as a capital lor discounts    How
many persons \v< il 1 be mtetested in t'ie m unten
anee of that fund m tre ban ^    All the s uphold-
ers, to the amount of several 'housands, whose div
idends would be grea ly increased, in some in
stances, no doubt, more than one hundred percent
He had known something ot one deposite bank,
whose dividen Is vveie increased nearly at thai rate
The customers of the bank, and all dependent upon
it, have also an interest
The Secretary of the Treasurj. has not abused
the power improperly confei red upon him , but the
influente of thi= svstem wasgiea* and dangerous
It was a moneyed influence, which ought to b so
far as possible, kept ouh of the Govemment The
use of the public funds w as entnelj wrong and to
receive m'ciest was mcieamg the evil Instead
of swelling the flood tide of Executive power, the
proposed plan would destroy th it dangerous mon-
eyed influence w hich belongs to the picsent s,s
tem, the most to be deprecated of all Execulti e
power
But it is said *hal, it this bill vas to pass, the le
suit would be the establ ishment ot a Treasui j bank
Surely there is nothing in this bill which ha> anv
connexion w ith a Treasury bank, noi could he see
any ttudencv it had to such e lcsult    If a T eas
urybank snould be u.tabh Vd, it must be bv, tne
subsequent action ot Confess vv holl}   ndepen lent
of the proposed fmanei d mtasiue     He haMh
knew what the Senator lio n Virginia mcttm b\ a
Treasury bank, but if it means onh tne issuing o'
a limited amount of Ti easm vnotes or draiis insed
on the funds of the Govemment and the faith ot the
United States, and leceivable foi the public dues,
he should not be  much a'armed at such a bark,
provided he could be satisfied as to oiu constitu    ¡
tional powei t© establish it    Ht agreed with the
Senator from South Caí olma (Mr Calhoun) in the
opinion  that a limited amount oí papel   of that
description wQuid be found ex le.nely convenient
not only for the financial concern^ of the Govem-
ment, butfoi exchange, and other commercial pui
poses It would be truly a national currency, pos
sessmg equal i alue m all parts of the Union, and,
of course, have advantages over any bank issue ,
whilst it would be free from those ruinous con-
tractions and expansions which invariably attend
a bank note currencv
Mr N said that the proposed financial system, '
like all otheis, had three distinct aspects m which
it must be viewed its efhciencv m tne conducting
of the finances, its political tendency and beai mg,
and its indirect influence on the cui rency He had
disposed of the first two divisions of tins subject,
and it now only i emiined for him to make a fi-w
ob«ei va ions on the last The poweis and duties
of this Government in i elation to the currenc} are
a subject about which veiy different opinions pie-
vail, both here and elsewhere
The honoiablo Senatoi from Massachusetts
(Mr Webster) maintains, with great strength of ar-
gument, that this Gov eminent possesses an inde-
pendent, substartive power ovei the entire subject
of currency, embi acmg the bills of St-ne banks, and
w hntever else may circulate as money He also
said that he di 1 not mean to be understood as ex-
pressing the opinion that there was but one way m
w Inch Congress could exercise flit, power of super-
vising and regulating the cuirencj By the one
waj he (Mi N ) supposed w asmtant the establish-
ment of a national bank, m whaf ot/tei umj the gen-
tleman pioposesto legulate the cunencyhe has
not informed us He, for one, felt anxious to see
the gentleman's other measuies
The Senator from Virginia does not admit that
Corgi ess has an} distinct, independent power, but
considers tha* ts power over the currency is oniy
incidental to th" levenne power This opinio* is
not consistent with the views ol man) in regard to
the tai iff, j et he (Mi N ) considered it the ti ae doc-
time
In the a lop ton or measures foi the collection,
safe keeping, and disbursement of the revenue, Con-
gress can take into considera ion the effect which
ouch measures may have on the geneial cunency
of the country This is all we can do , we cannot
dnectlj interfere With the issues ot the Slate banks
Tlus me idental effect which may be pioducedby
our financial measuies, would na mallv seem to be
of secondary, but now appears tobe íegaided as of
pnm?rj importance Indeed it is the real or suppos-
ed beating of the financial measuies of this Govern-
ment on 'he geneial currenc) of the country that
at aches to them so d eo and extensiv e an inteiest
It becomes thciefoit. important toco 3ider how

the State banks, but when u is proposed to do Va ,
in any other way, that is regarded as an msupeiaDle
objection to the measure How is tins'! Can Si ite
banks only be legulated by federal banks, or is it a
mere pretext that a national bank is wanted asa
regulator of the State institutions'!
But this constant demand for specie in the imp-
actions of the Government will piomote the gene-
ral ciiculation of com, and improve the whole cur-
rency, it will rendet oui cunency, in some reason-

distinguishing featuit, and tnBhest recommenda-
tion This sepal ation is not only important m a,
political point of view, but if possible, equally so"
m its effect on the cu rrency and the interest ot the
conntiy What have been the fiuits of this con-
nexion i Sir, there is high authority on this point,
w hicli goes to show that it has been injurious both
to the Go/eminent and the banks jjr Biddle, the
President oi the late Bank of the United States, who,
in the opinion of sone, is the greatest financier that
now exists, or ever did, oi ever will exist, has. ex-
pressed this opinion At the organization of the
Pennsvl v ania Bank of the United States, m 1836, he
congratulated the stotkholdeis on the prosperous
condition of their mteiests, tne accumulation of a
laige surplus fund, and the purchase of a new char-
ter, and boasted that thcbanli being "safer, stioiger,
and nnie piospeious than it ever was" He also
adds lhat "it v<zs an oi i ¡final rnisfoi tune in the
sli uctme of the bank that it was in any way connected
itith persons in office The instincts of all political
power make that as ociation dangerous—useful to
nedhei parly—vijw urns to both "
Sir, I repeat the question, What have been the
fiuits of (his connexion of bank and Statet Let
the expei íence of the country answer1 He need
not go back to the last wai, when, in the negotiation
of loans with banks to the amount of about fifty
millions at least fifteen millions of dollars was sac-
rificed bv the Government These loans consisted
oí exchanginglhe creditof ti e United States, which
was vastlvbettei tl an thatot any bank, forthe cre-
dit of the banks at the rate of eign'j and eighty-
five dolla>s foi a hundred This occasioned the
rapid enlargement of bank issues during the war,
and lead to tl e suspensi hi of the banks m 1814,
and to a long tram oí calamitous consequences,
under v/hieh fhe counti v languished Jor five or six
/eais He had already alluded to lh°se circum-
stances
Tin connex on has gieatly liKi cased he ineg-
u'ai acuon of the banks and s i nulated then con-
tractions and expansions The first gieat andsud-
den expansion of the Bank of the United States, in
1817 vv as in part, occasioned by the Government
redeemingnhn teen millions of its stock, then held
by the bank, as part of i's capital, which obliged it
to 1 lan it suddenly to individual The public de-
posites, as is well known, have always been used
bv the banks as the basis of discounts and, as they
mciease and dimmish suddenly this pioduces a
con espondmg enlargement and curtailment oftheir
loans
In consequence of this unfortunate connexion, as
Mi Biddle calis t eveij measure of the Govern-
ment of a mere financial chaiactei having no di-
ict bearing on anv commercial interest, has for
j ears occasioned a disturbai ce m the monetary
concerns of the countn, wluc1 , unclei o ir credit
