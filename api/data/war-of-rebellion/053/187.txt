STEVENSON, October 8, 1863-10 a.m.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD:

Wartrace:

Can you inform me in what direction the rebels are retiring? If toward Huntsville I can strike them there. If the Ohio battery is no longer needed, direct it to return here, and post the Twelfth Corps where most required to protect the road. When our communication is fully re-opened return.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.

STEVENSON, October 8, 1863-3.30 p.m.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD:

Wartrace:

With my limited knowledge of the character of the troops stationed along the road, and not feeling confident as to the whereabouts and movements of the enemy, it will be advisable for the present to stretch the Twelfth Corps along the road from Murfreesborough to Tantalon, at the same time making use of all the other troops now on the road for the same service. Direct General Slocum to establish his headquarters at Wartrace, and place him in command of all the troops on the line indicated. One of his division commanders should be at Decherd; the other he can establish where he pleases. Before returning I wish you to visit the line and see if it is all right.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.
