Poslponement of fourth instalment—Mr. Taylor.
H. of Reps.
Have we a > ¿ht to withhold this money' Upon
thib point it does seem to me that gentlemen have
run wild With all due respect for them, I must
say that their arguments remind me of scenes I
have witnessed, when a very young man, be-
foie a magislnte w the country, where two
joung lawyers were engaged m pettifogging a
case about five dollars They read Blackstone
and other elementary works, and gravelv
informs us that " a contract is an agreement to do
or not to do a narticular thing, upon sufficient con-
sideration " We aie then told that the General
and Sta'e Govemmen s made a solemn contract
about tnese deposites, which compels us to pay
tlicm ovei, whether we have the money or not'
Gentlemen Hilt of this Government as though it
vveie something fore gn fio i, and hostile to, the
people and to the State Governments What delu-
sion1 Who- made this Government' The people of
too several States, acting as separate communities,
through the^r constituted agent  Whose Govern-
ment is it' The people's Have they any interest,
other than the interest of the Government1 Cei-
tainly not Whose money is tins'* You say, the
people's Very well If thp GeneialGovernment
and the State Governments both belong to the
people, and this mon } also be ongs to them it is
merdy a question to which of the Govei nments shall
itbegiven' The Stale Gov ernr.ientssav ihe} want it
so do ive We have collected it under onr laws, and
intended to pi ice it vv ilh the States for safe keeping
until vve needed it, but it turns out that we want it
befoie it las been pa scd over to them Is the
Geneial Government t> ciop, in order that
money ma' 1 e pla ed w th in  Sta'cs fo, safe
keeping'1 The proposilic n is an absurd tv upon its
face Me we to pay ove this money for the
pleasure of immediately cilli g it bad ' Whit
statesmai vou1' "diocite  u h a doctrine''
When die luW of June, 18 iG, passed, tn s mo-
ney was Heated as a deposite Ever? one knows,
that, as a di u ibuhon law, it could never hav e
passed through either House of Congress, and if it
had, it would have been vetoed by the President
It is neated as a deposite upon the face of the law
The Secretary is dnected, by consent of the States,
to place the money With them The word consent is
used as to the banks also, and for the obvious rea-
son, that we could not compel either the States or
the State banks to take our mone} , tney must consent
to i' Neifhei tie terms employed, noi the pro-
cep 1 ngs enjoined, imply a c m raot, exept that
the States and banks shall pay the mon°y .o this
Government when required to do so Suppose
Congress had repealed that law before January,
1837, would the States have been entitled to any
thing under it' Have they a vested right to the mo-
ney ' Suppose a war had broken out in the inter-
val, between June, 1836, and January, 1837, ren-
dering all the funds we had neoessaiy for the pur
poses ot this Government—would any one co i
tend that we were s'dl bound to go on, and depo-
site the money' Congress did virtually repeal the
law m part, by appropriating some six or seven
millions lasi session over and above all the othet
money which they had m the Treasurv, and of
couise thus tar enci caching upon this fund When
the law of June, 183G passed, we were told that the
States were patriotic and high mmaed, and
would pay this money promptly, whenever
it should be n™ led, and that, until that pe-
riod, they cou'd use it, which was much bet-
ter than to allow the banks to use it for their pu-
v ate adv antage It w as supposed it w ould be much
safer too in the St-iteTreasuiies than in th  banks
What do we s°e and heat now' Now it is a con-
hect and although three instalments nave beer
paid, and the Treasury is emnt}, gen'lemen he-e
are w llhng to see the w heels of Gov ernmenf slop,
that they may "ecuie the balance which then
States expected to receive' Whc would haveanti-
cipited this' We have given them our all, and
thev now wart us to v lolate the Constttu ion, and
bonow money to place on deposite wrh the States'
If we can do so for that purpose, we can borrow
to loan to banks anl individuals, or foi anv other
purpose under heaven We placed th s monev
with the States, supposing it would be safer than in
the banks.   The banks can not now pay us w hat
they have Tot, thoiuh thev will finally dis harge
eveiy dollar, but the amount with the States will
indeed be safer than m banks, for, from the
spirit displayed in Congress, i" do not believe we
shall ever get the consent of their representatives
to pay back one dollar of what the/ have received
Gentlemen talk of contracts, and of "public faith"'
That will be keep ng public faith, and fulfill ng
contracts, with a vengeance'
Is it expedient to withhold this money' I think
so We are about to issue ten or twelve millions
af Treasury notes They will be pavab'é one year
after date We should have a fund prov ided ioi
their redemption as they fail due This mi ney in
the banks is that fund In connection with what
will be paid in on the meichants' bonds, we shall
have a sum equal to the notes issued The value
of sueh papei as Treasury no'es depends somewhat
upon the abili'y to make piotrpt payment, as well
as upon the ultimate responsibil ty of the Govern-
ment The receivabilit r of Ihe nolo" m pa\ ment
of pubUc dues w il' create a demand for tfVm , and
the provision <br fhrur promot piyment will add to
their value in the money marke*
'vgam we must either retain tbc^e funds, or bor-
row money to Cairy on the Government We mus'
issue stock, and cieate a national debt, or referí to
these funds Gentlemen say vve are boirowmg
money when vve issue notes Well, be it so Then,
when I settle with my neighbor, and give him my
due bill for the balance I owe him, because I have
not the mrney, I have bononel that sum of money
fiomhim' Is l1 is die common, usual acceptation
offhcfeim' If it s not, w hy become so verj me-
taphysical and a tote all it once, to fix upon Us
whal issuppjs*d tr< be theort um of boriowing i o
nev' We cannot pi\, because we Ca.ii lot collee
aid like hoi- t m i * ecruc po'os to th > e v e
ove, pro- i-, t > i"v „ s n a-, vve can yet o ir
money Toa the v no emattei, di^gui e t as
j on will
We have not the means to pay this instalment ¡o
the States The Secietary has told us so He can-
not raise the money Gentlemen affirm that the
States will take the paper of the deposite banks
Why, vve all ) n nv that this is not so The States
might take the piper of banks within their own
hints, o' in then immediate neighborhood, but
the bank' in the south and west have nearly all
the money due the Government There is no mo-
nev ,r fhe nor h Will \I"ss chuset* take the pa-
pe of i'ie Al .'rama aid Mississippi bark'—f jib
ten to twenty percent belo-v par in Boston—and
bind herself to letiin specie, when cal'ed upon
foi payment' Will Maine, New York, or ary
other middle or northern State, do so' We know
thev V i'I not It is idle, therefore, to talk of turn-
ing the banks over to the States The States would
present then diafts upon the banks, get them pro-
tested, and the i íetuin them upon the Tress ir> —
producing «till further embarrassment than airead)
exists
It we create a debt bv lor'ovmg monev, how is
it to be paid' Bj new taxes levied upon the pei-
ple Not d reet taxes, nut but by a high tariff let
the planting and ago ultmal S'atfs look to this
Without a debt, theie can be no pirt xt foi keeping
up the tariff Wiin su~h an mcumbiarce, there
w ill be a reason for ts cont nuance and when was
suca an opportunity ever known to slip through
the fngeis of the manufac unng mfeiest, uithovt

As to the amendment o^-icd to this bill bv t! e
genlleman <rom S nth Caiolma, (Mr Picica ,) I
ha e nothing to say I see no part cular objection
fo it, and snail vote for the bill wnether the amen 1-
ment prevail or not In either case, my object
will have been effected 1 hat object is tne pos-
ponement oí  the depos to, to enable the Govern-
ment tu use its own funds, to pay its debts, and
In hi its obligations
These are our measures, this is our system If
the oppos tion have any thing better, let them pre-
sent it, and I, for one, will cheerfully vote for it.
The question presented to eveiy gentleman now is,
ni lief or no rhih Show us v our hands, gen-
tlemen' What do jou intend to do' Have you any
pl m to relieve the country' 0 n you do any thing
for the people' Are you wilhng the wheels of the
people's Government shall move on, or do you
mean to let them stop' The'e a.e grave ques-
tions, anl everv man must answer them to
himself and to his constituents in the best man-
ner hr can But, sir, the pet pie will not judge
gentlemen by tneir piofesswns, the pi acta must
conform to them And without pre'ending to the
gift of prophecy, I will predict, tiiat he who offers
nothing foi the publ o benefit, at this perilous and
interesting cnsis, and at the same time opposes all
measures presented by others—no ¡natter how
m ich concern he may avow for the sufferings of
his country—on his return to the bosom of Ins dis-
tort, will find himself subjected to a fiery ordeal
befoie h s it su1 'ed constituents The food sense
cf the coi i.tiy will set tl is matter r ght, aid by
that decision, w lung ir urv i! mg, nc must all

For my ow n part, 1 shall sustain the bi'ls befoie
'ne House, bclicv ing them to be fraught with per-
manent good for that ccmoioi country, which
should be so dear to us a'l And whe'hei they suc-
ceed < i fáfl, Í shall at least have the consolationef
