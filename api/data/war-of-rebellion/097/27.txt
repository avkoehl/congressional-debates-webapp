HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., March 17, 1865.

General MORGAN,

Chief of Staff;

The pontoon bridge was taken up to-day. The Shenandoah rose so rapidly I had to do so save tit. I cannot relay it until water subsides, as I have not enough boats on this side Potomac to lengthen it. Uncles Shenandoah continues to rise can laty it down by day after to-morrow.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
