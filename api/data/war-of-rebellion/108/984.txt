Arrived here last night. Have the Chickahominy strongly guarded (supposed to mean, "I have the Chickahominy strongly guarded") upon the Richmond side from where General Lee's right rests, upon the other side to Bottom's Bridge, and from that point across to James River. Enemy are not in any force in my front and show no disposition to cross. Butler's troops moved from the White House in the direction of Cold Harbor. Please communicate this to General Lee.

General R. E. LEE:

GENERAL: I am on Williamsburg road about one mile from Bottom's Bridge. I have the river closely watched from New bridge to Long Bridge, on Chickahominy, and Colonel Robins, who is at Malvern Hill, pickets from Long Bridge to James River.

FITZ. LEE,

Major-General.
