HARRISBURG, August 18, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Under your order of the 9th August power is conferred on Governors to appoint a commissioner for each county to make the draft. It is impossible for one man to perform the duties in any reasonable time. I suggest that in cities like Philadelphia authority be given to make an appointment for each legislative district.

A. G. CURTIN,

Governor.

WASHINGTON, D. C., August 18, 1862.

Major-General WOOL,

Harrisburg, Pa.:

The Secretary of War has approved your recommendation in relation to minors.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

WASHINGTON, D. C., August 18, 1862.

Brigadier-General KETCHUM,

Harrisburg, Pa.:

Communicate with Governor Curtin and urge upon him the importance of pushing forward troops without a moment's delay. The enemy is accumulating troops more rapidly than we are, and re-enforcements must be sent us with all possible haste.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
