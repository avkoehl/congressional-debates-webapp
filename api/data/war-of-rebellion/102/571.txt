Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., May 23, 1865.

Major J. W. BARNES,

Asst. Adjt. General, Department of the Missouri, Saint Louis:

Major Moore, commanding at Cassville, telegraphs this afternoon that Lieutenant Strong (rebel), who surrendered last week, has come in again to-day, and reports that Colonel Coffee and Tuck Smith are concentrating on the Osage Fork of King's River in Carroll County, Ark., and that he did not know the force. I think they have a force of from 400 to 600 men. I may need more mounted troops here to cover the whole country.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., May 23, 1865.

Major J. M. MOORE,

Commanding at Cassville:

It is probable that a band of guerrillas, about thirty-five in number, will cross the road going south to-night or to-morrow. This is a most bloody band and will probably pass between Cassville and this place. Do all you can to capture and destroy them. Notify all citizens to be on the lookout. They have killed and citizens who have fallen into their hands, some twenty in all.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

CASSVILLE, May 23, 1865.

J. M. MOORE,

Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., May 23, 1865.

Major J. M. MOORE,

Commanding at Cassville:

Send a scout or spy out and learn if possible how much force Coffee and Smith have. Learn if possible if they are not willing to surrender. In the meantime keep your command well in hand. Horses are on the way down.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
