APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
201
26th Cong~.~..1st Sess.
State Debts—Mr. Hubbard.
Senate.
my, if by parchas  or by grants from individual
States, not only the resolutions of Congress, but
the terms of the cessions themselves, show with
equal certainty that the territory thus acquired
was for the common benefit of the whole, and lo
stand particularly pledged to pay the debts and
charges of the Revolution.
The lands then acquired, either by conquest or
cession, were, according-to the history of the limes,
distinctly set apart to meet the expenses of the
var__to furnish the means for the extinguishment
of the public debt of the Revolution; and, under the
articles of confederation, it would not be con-
tended that Congress possessed the power to make
any other disposition ol the public lands, except
for public parposes, and for liquidating the charges
incurred in the common defence. The following
were the sentiments once expressed in this Senate
by a member then at the head of the Committee on
the Public Lands:
"It m admitted on all hands that, under the articles of confe-
deration, Cone re  had no power to distribute the proceeds of
the «ale  of the public lands among the several States, for local
or internal purposes—to make grants to the new States, when-
sMvar they might be introduced into the Union, or to make de-
nations to individuals or to bodies corporate: nor, indeed, could
any power be exercised, distinct from such as were contained in
tie deeds of cession."
And if Congress had then such limited powers,
it will hardly be contended that, under the confede-
ration, it had the power to abstract any portion of
the public revenues for the purpose of paying the
debts of the several States.
The public lands within the limits of the Confe-
deracy at the treaty of peace, stood pledged for the
redemption of the public debt—the costs and charge 
necessarily incurred in thtir acquisition.
UnCer the Confederation, then, Congress had no
power to dispose of the public lauds, except for
the benefit of the whole. And what additional pow-
ers Congress now possess over this subject must
have been conferred by the Constitution itself. And
what are they?   By the 3d seeiion of the 4th arti-
cle of the Constitution, it is provided "that Con-
gress shall have power to dispose of, and to make
all needful rules and regulations respecting the
territory or other property of the United States;"
And what is. the plain meaning of that clause?
That Congress shall have power to fix the price of the
public lands, to prescribe the necessary rules for their
disposal, and to tell and to convey the public do-
main, at such prices, and under such regulations, as
shall have been prescribed, for the general welfare.
It had no more power under the clause cited, to dis-
pose of the public land  for any particular purpose,
than it has to dispose of the other public property.
The exercise of this power must be, according to
the nature and fitness of things, necessarily limited
to.the furtherance of the public welfare. The lands
and the other property belong to all the States, and
they cannot, consistent with the true meaning of the
Constitution, be   disposed of, for the   exclusive
benefit of any one member of the Confederacy.
They cannot be granted to a foreign power to the
prejudice   of our common country.   Under this
clause of the Constitution, Congress possesses no
more power, in my judgment, to dispose of the pub-
lic lands for local or sectional objects, than it had
under, the articles of confederation.   These lands
were acquired either by conquest or by purchase,
and acquired for the cemmon benefit.   They could
then, and they can now, be conveyed for the gene-
ralgood.   I contend, then, Mr. President, that there
is no express provision of the Constitution, giving
tO'Congress the power to sell and convey the pub-
lic lands to the States for any local purposes.   No
such power is expressed, or can be implied; and
equally clear is it to my mind, that Congress has
not the authority,under the Constitution, to distri-
bute that port'on of the revenue arising from the
sales'of the public lands, among the States, to re-
lieve them from their indebtedness, or to aid them
in the prosecution of their works of internal im-
provement.   No such power is expressed, and no
sjeh power can be implied.   Bat, for argument,
Jet us admit that Congrcs posses-es  ihe comlitu-
H nd fewer to do all this. Would it be just? Would
not such a distribution be in total dtsregatd of the
terms of the cession"?   And would it not be wholly
repugnant to the objects of the Government, in ac-
quiring the tjtle and control of the public, un-
granted, and unsettled lands of the West? They
were set apart to pay the debt of the Revolution.
And has it been done by means derived from the
lands? Has that been done? I admit that the debt has
been extinguished. But how stands Ihe account
between the public lands and the public Treasury?
Has the Government been Supplied with the means
for the extinguishment of the Revolutionary debt,
from that source of revenue? No. The publie
lands have been, and still are, a charge upon the
publie Treasury. They have not contributed the
first dollar towards the payment of the expenses of
the Revolution. I remarked that that debt bad been
paid. Not precisely so: there still remains a portion of
the debt ol the Revolution unsatisfied. There still
exists an annual charge upon the Treasury to meet
the claims of that small remnant of patriots, whose
services and sacrifices in the great cause of their
country, have been in some degree requited by
their descendants. The Revolutionary pensioners
draw from the Treasury, year following year, a
little less than four millions of dollar?. Is not this
a debt of the Revolution? And is it not most em-
phatically one of those debts for the redemption of
which the public lands were pledged? If this
be true,then, I add, that the revenue arisiBg from the
sale of the public lands should be sacredly reserved
for the perfect discharge of this remaining debt of
the Revolution.
The pensions now amount to nearly four mil-
lions of dollars annually, and the yearly avails of
the land', according to public estimate , amount
also to about the same sura. Let, then, the re-
ceipts balance this expenditure. This would be
right and consistent with the grants made by
States to the Confederacy; and upon the principle
of common justice, I would oppose the distribution,
among the States, of this portion of the public re-
venue, while this charge upon the public Treasury
exists. But, Mr. President, I am not driven to
any such extremity. I will proceed to show,
according to the means within my pewer, what has
been the cost of the public lands from the foun-
dation of the Government to the presant time;
what have been the receipts into the Treasury from
the sales of the publie domain. I will state the ac-
count current between the lands and the Treasury,
and I shall then appeal to the justice of the Senate
to decide upon the questions presented. In in pur-
suance of the following resolution:
That the Secretary of the Treasury prepare and report to this
House, as soon as conveniently may bs done, statements
showing—
The entire cost to the Government ef all the public lands to
which the Indian title has been extinguished, and of the care and
sale of the same, as near as the same can be ascertained
and estimated, including the pay and compensation and
expenses to the Government of All persons employed; the
amount paid, and obligated to be paid, for the extinguishment
of Indian titles, accounting annuities at such sums as, invested
at five per cent, would produce them, and excluding the pur-
chase money for cessions from foreign Governments; and the
expenses of Indian wars; and the like amount, including the
purchase money paid for the acquisition of lands and territories
from foreign Governments.
The. Commissioner of the General Land Office,
on the 7th February, 1839, communicated to the
House of Representatives the following:
Statement of ihe cost in the acquisition and management of
the public lands, and of the receipts arising from the sale
thereof, to the3üth September, 1838.
The whole expenditure under the head of Indian department,
from the commencement of the Government to the 30ih of
September, 1838, as far as can be ascertained from the records
of this office, amounts to         -          -         - «32,017,59s SO

tuting the aggregate of charge upon the Treasury,
by the purchase and management of the public
lands, up to the 30th of September, 1838. This is
not all. It appears from a communication, which
1 have obtained from the Indian Department, that
the Government has paid, and is liable to pay for
the extinguishment of the Indian title, to February
7,1839, the sum of       -          -   $84,549,254   81

which the Government obligated
itself to pay    -           -          -        335,680 00
And since that period, also, the
Government has made treaties
wi'h the Iowas, Creeks, Osages,
Stockbridges, and- Munsees, not
exclusively for the acquisition of
territory, I admit, but cf such a
character as to warrant me in
charging to the publio lands the
amount which the Government,
by those treaties, is bound to
pay, viz:          -          -          -     1,089,118 03
Thece several items of charge for
the extinguishment of the Indian
title, amount to

In the foregoing exhibit, it has been my pur-
pose to present an accurate statement of the costs
of the public land, up to given periods; and I
subjoin the communication I have received from
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, which gives

$84,549,254 81 paid, and to be paid out, for the
