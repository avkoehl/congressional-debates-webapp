SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

September 21, 1863.

General RAWLINS:

All my parties are now in, having been 15 miles to the north and 8 to the northeast, to Baker's Creek, and beyond to within 8 miles of Raymond and along the road by Cayuga, Hall's Ferry, &amp;c.

A force of the enemy's scouts were captured that will be sent to the provost-marshal at Vicksburg. General Osterhaus thinks the enemy has left the entire country to our front and gone to Enterprise, but negroes report some 300 stealing cattle in the Deer Creek country. My own impression is by a judicious advance we could drive the enemy, so that we could occupy the line from Mobile to Selma, &c., to Huntsville and Chattanooga. Of courses this would necessitate the attack on Mobile and Selma. There is no enemy to my front. Colonel Fletcher was humbugged purposely.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

General OSTERHAUS:

I still think that Cosby's brigade is scattered to my front, but widely so. I hear of him near Clinton, and some of his men at Deer Creek stealing cattle. All right. Send prisoners to Vicksburg, with a copy of the list to these headquarters.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

SEPTEMBER 21, 1863.

General TUTTLE, Vicksburg:

I received telegraphic notice last evening, but have not got the orders yet. You had better come by my headquarters. The headquarters of the Third Division are now at Tribble's house. General Asboth was notified last night, but has no positive orders yet.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

[SEPTEMBER 21, 1863.]

General BUCKLAND, Oak Ridge:

General Osterhaus is just back from the front; he went nearly to Raymond. Reports the capture of a captain, lieutenant, sergeant of scouts, and that there is no cavalry to our front, all having been ordered to Enterprise. If the enemy is plundering the country of cattle we can pity them; they need the cattle, and it will save us the eternal bother of settling for them.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

General T. KILBY SMITH, Vicksburg:

Mr. Mithoff is just here. I have your two letters. I remember his son well, and am glad that at least one of my pupils remained
