batteries and if the Government could not furnish, to allow us to get them made. No answer has been received. It should be six instead of five batteries. We shall increase our troops to not less than 40,000. Volunteering goes on rapidly, and public opinion improving. I am very uneasy about Kentucky, but I suppose the Government is not, as orders to send troops to the border are countermanded.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor of Indiana.

INDIANAPOLIS, IND., September 7, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

In pursuance of your last order two regiments went to Saint Louis last night; two more to-morrow. Three more could be ready in sixty hours if they had arms. Sixteen other regiments in a forward state. Can there not be arms sent here by express at once? Please answer immediately.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor of Indiana.

BOSTON, September 7, 1861.

Secretary of War:

Possibly one or two regiments. A sudden call upon us would probably draw several thousand raw recruits instantly on great emergency.

JOHN A. ANDREW,

Governor of Massachusetts.

JACKSON, MICH., September 7, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

The Sixth Regiment Michigan Infantry left for Washington last week and must have arrived. The Seventh is now on the way. The Fifth can march full and uniformed in a hour's notice. The First, reorganized, can march with amount 700 strong. Stockton's, bout the same, and the Wight also about the same. We are proceeding with the greatest dispatch . The two new cavalry regiments have driven away recruits from the infantry badly.

AUSTIN BLAIR,

Governor of Michigan.

ALBANY, September 7, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: Dispatch received. By active measure, with some deficiencies in numbering and otherwise, I can probably move five or six regiments wherever ordered by latter part of next week. You are aware that as the order now stands I should send them to General Sherman to Fortress Monroe. If emergency require it, could in a yet more irregular form move them sooner. Address me Astor House, New York, where I shall be Monday and during all of next week.

E. D. MORGAN,

Governor of New York.
