quence of its being merely a pardoning power, there
w as no necessity for it, as he now had that pow ei
under the Constitution and laws without iuither le-
gislation. His objection to the clause which he had
moved lo strike out, was, that it invented the Ex-
ec ulive with judicial pow ers, and poweis which be-
longed exclusively to the Judiciary depar'ment, be-
cause it enabled him to c'eteimine w hether or not
an offenc  had been committed He apptehended
it would not do in this eouatry to ve^t judici >1
powers in the Executive
Mr McKAY consideied that it would be entuely
impropei to stuke out this clause It simply g-ne
powci to the Executive, in cases where propeity
had been seized lo lelease it The law provided
for the seirure ot jnopert), but not for its forlutuie,
therefoie, it was proper that the President should
have the power to release it, undei ceilim circum-
stances In case this amtndment pi evaded, and
the clause was struck out, goods could only be re-
stored by the judgment of couits, and where they
had been seized in consequence of a violation of
the law, there must be great delay and loss to the
citizens in certain cases
The motion to strike out -ñas then disagiced lo
The second section being read,
Mr FILLMORE moved to strike out that part
of the section which made the bill apphc able only
to conterminous temtoiies Mr F íemaiked that
it m ght be said that theie was \uy hule danger of
getting into any difficulty with countnes which did
not he contiguous to the United States, but he
thought our legislation ought to beunifoim He
bad an objection to having a law passed by Con-
ficss which subjected bis constituents to a lule
nhch wis not general, and lor this leason he
hoped his amendment might prevail
Mi HOWARD rtmarked that it was necessaiy
lo stnpe our legislation to Ihe circumstances m
which we were placed We already had laws which
which were applicable to expeditions fitted out
ioi seivice at sea, and against loreign countries,
and it now became necessaiy to pass laws to pie-
serve our neutrality with conterminous counlnis,
and this law had been introduced to effect that ob
ject     He hoped the amendment would not pievail
Mi HOLSEY contended that this bill was
about to place us in the same relation to conk r-
mmous countries which it did to other loreign
countries, if it passed, and urged upon the gen-
tleman from New York to withdraw his propo-
sition to amend
Mr FILLMORE sustained his amendment on
the ground that the Lili created invidious ehstinc-
tions, which ought never to exist in the legislation
ol any country
Mi PECK called for the yeas and najs on this
amendment, but the House íefused to order them,
and the amendment of Mr Phl-viorl. was dis-
agreed to.
Mr EVERETT moved to strike out that clause
which provided that the law should nut mieifeie
wiih the trade authorised to be carried on by the
laws of the nations   loa
Mr ROBINSON moved to strike out all after
the enacting clause to line sixteen, and insert an
amendment which he sent to the Chan, providing
that in all cases of seizures, affidavit should first be
made, and a warrant issued
Mr R urged his amendment on the House, on
the ground ot the unconstitulionahly of making
seizures without due course of law, as was pro-
posed to be uone by the bill
Mr P4TTON replied to Mr R pointing to the
tni*d section of the bill, winoh provided ihat im-
mediately after the secure, a wanant should be
obtained in due form from ¡some jn licial oíiic i foi
the purpose of holding the property sewed This
he contended was all Ihat was necessaiy to guard
against ti e abuse ofpowei, and he argued thit if
a wanant under oaln was tu b^ obtained before
seizure, that the law would be whody ineffectual,
as it would in almost every ms'ance, if not in
everv one, be c aded
M'i MENirEE then addressed the House at
so ne iengtn, m opposition to the bill, on the ground
of its unconstitutionality
