HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 21, 1864-7.30 a. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Is Ferrero in your line? What is his strength? It is of the utmost importance that each corps stretches to the maximum length of line to hold defensively, and I wish you to put all your troops in the line, and if you can with security extend your left I wish it done, in order that Warren may extend his.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH CORPS,June 21, 1864-7.45 a. m.

Major-General MEADE, Commanding Army of the Potomac:

You dispatch received. General Ferrero is in position and is in support of Generals Ledlie's and Willcox's divisions, and we have not as many men on that portion of the line as Generals Barlow and Mott had, particularly the line occupied by general Willcox, but we have thinned the lines, thereby lengthening them out. General Potter is similarly situated. If you desire me to leave but a single line in the works I can extend to the left probably to the extent of one of Warren's divisions, and we will do our best to hold it, but I am compelled to say that the length and importance of the line would render it dangerous in my opinion.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,June 21, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS:

We had reports last night of heavy, fighting at the White House.

Have you anything reliable from there?

BURNSIDE,

General.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,June 21, 1864-7 p. m.

Do you care to consider a proposition for an assault on the enemy on the front of our lines?

Major-General.
