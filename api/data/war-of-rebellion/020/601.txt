General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

GENERAL: I have just received Special Orders, No. 202, of August 29, from your office. I most earnestly entreat that I may be ordered into the field for active service. I have done everything in my power for the State of South Carolina, and my arrangements for the defense of Charleston and Savannah have been made, whether judiciously or not, at least uncontrolled by the interference of others. Having occupied this position since the early part of March last, it will be humiliating in the extreme to me to be now-almost at the moment of anticipated attack by the enemy-reduced to a subordinate position in this command. I beg that it may be understood that I do not even intend to express a wish not to be superseded by General Beauregard, who I doubt not is far more capable of filling satisfactorily the responsible position I have so long held. I only ask that I may be transferred myself to some other point where I may not be useless; and if I may be allowed a preference, I would say to Virginia.
