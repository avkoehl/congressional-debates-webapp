LITTLE ROCK, ARK., November 8, 1864.

Brigadier-General ANDREWS,

Devall's Bluff:

The 200 men from the Ninth Kansas Cavalry, when they return, will relieve the pickets from Colonel Clopper's command, so that you can send the scout to Batesville from Clopper's command.

C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

DEVALL'S BLUFF, ARK., November 8, 1864-9 p. m.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Little Rock:

I am able to get only 130 men from cavalry depot, and they from the Fourth Arkansas. Major Greeno will go, and says they need to shoe the horses to-night, and will start at daylight. If you think best, I will try and get 100 men out of the Ninth Kansas, just returned. The larger the scout the better, in my opinion.

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., November 8, 1864.

Brigadier-General ANDREWS,

Devall's Bluff:

Do not send any of the Ninth Kansas toward Batesville, but have them ready in case of need for southern scout. let Major Greeno's scout go as far as he can with his force. Left him detach small parties to scout up Little Red River, and cross with his main force. All parties should report any news to the nearest telegraph station.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

DEVALL'S BLUFF, ARK., November 8, 1864-4.30 p. m.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Little Rock:

The scout of Ninth Kansas, under Major W. Doudna, has returned, and is crossing the river. It brought five rebel soldiers, who claimed to be deserters, seven colored men, and about a dozen mules and horses. They found rebel pickets four miles this side of Cotton Plant and encountered small squads round in the country. It was reported to Major Doudna yesterday that Colonel Adams, with 700 men, was moving from the direction of Crowley's Ridge this way, and was going to attack him. Major D. camped this side of Cache River last night, and after dark sent back a scout, which discovered several camp-fires on the other side and force judged to be 200 men. It was reported that part of Dobbin's command was back at Jacksonport, and that there was some rebel force at West Point. At 3 p. m. I ordered scout from cavalry depot to start, having previously given notice for it to be in readiness. It has not got here yet. Has been a heavy shower.

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
