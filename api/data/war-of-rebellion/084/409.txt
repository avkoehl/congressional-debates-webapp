Brigadier-General FISK,

Commanding District of North Missouri, Saint Joseph:

You are authorized to raise two regiments of infantry and one of cavalry in the western portion of your district; also one of infantry at Hannibal, all to serve for twelve months; men to be mustered into the service of the United States as fast as possible. The officers selected by you and approved by me will be commissioned by the Governor. Communications on the subject to go through General Gray, adjutant-general of the State.

SAINT JOSEPH, July 26, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I am in receipt of your telegram authorizing the four twelve-months' regiments and will push their organization with all the vigor I have. I know Colonel Harding to be an excellent officer, but allow me to suggest, general, that the northwest will find fault at the importation of field officers from Saint Louis. If the Governor will let me manage that part I will put it through without friction and give him as good officers as ever drew swords.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The bushwhacker hunt is progressing successfully. Our forces are capturing and killing a large number of the guerrillas and securing their horses and arms. The brush on Platte and Fishing Rivers, and in the country between, swarms with the Thornton squads. Our dragnet will bring them out. What shall I do with young men who desert Thornton and surrender with the oft-told tale of deception, sorrow, repentance, &amp;c.?
