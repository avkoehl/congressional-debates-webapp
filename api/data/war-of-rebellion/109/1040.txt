NEW MARKET, VA., September 21, 1864-5.30 p. m.

Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Asst. Adjt. General, Headquarters Army of Northern Virginia:

If the enemy intends to do more than over the head of his bridge at Deep Bottom, he will probably try to take possession of the hill at New Market. The local troops and reserves are not more than enough to hold Chaffin's Bluff and to the left as far as the New Market road. Colonel Sanford's Alabama regiment, Hankins' battery, and a portion of Gary's cavalry may hold New Market for to-night if they can be got here in time. If if is desired to hold this position, if Chambliss can be spared for the purpose, or some other brigade of cavalry or infantry, it would be well to send it.

G. W. C. LEE,

Brigadier-General.
