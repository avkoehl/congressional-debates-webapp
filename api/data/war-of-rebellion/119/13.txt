CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

Richmond, Va., June 12, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel WILLIAM H. LUDLOW, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: Doctor Rucker is prosecuted by the State of Virginia for offenses against her laws for which he had no warrant in your own military law to commit. If you have any officer of the Confederate States in any such position, even though he may have been declared exchanged by our general agreements, I cannot complain of his retention.

With this proper limitation extending to only one case I am ready at any moment to deliver you every officer or man whom we have declared exchanged. I do not believe there are any such in our prisons. I have, however, cause diligent search to be made, and if any such are discovered they will be promptly delivered to you.

I hope, therefore, you will have all our exchanged officers and men sent to City Point immediately. You will find there any of the same class whom I san discover. I will be thankful to you for any names which you may be able to furnish. Spencer Kellogg's case is already under inquiry.

With the limitation as to Doctor Rucker I am entirely agreed to release unconditionally all surgeons. I agree with you that the cause of humanity demands it unless, indeed, it is shown that the surgeon has committed offenses which prove him to be a savage and beast.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.
