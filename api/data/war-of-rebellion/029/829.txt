Colonel Hunt, Ninth Kentucky, although not in the engagement of Friday, deserves commendation for his conduct prior and subsequent to that time, as do the other officers and the men of his regiment.

Respectfully,

R. P. TRABUE,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

T. O'HARA,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S.-The missing list comprises those who went into the engagement, but were not seen to come out. They must have been killed or wounded. I find, also, I have omitted to mention that Lieutenant-Colonel Stansel received a severe wound in the leg, but did not quit the field, and still commands his regiment.

No. 243. Report of Lieut. Col. M. L. Stansel, Forty-first Alabama Infantry.

TULLAHOMA, TENN., January 12, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to make the following report of the performances of this regiment in the recent seven days' battles in front of Murfreesborough, Tenn.:

On Sunday, December 28, this regiment, together with the other regiments composing Hanson's brigade, acting under orders proceeding from general headquarters, proceeded to Wayne's Hill and formed line of battle in rear and in support of Cobb's battery and a section of the Washington Artillery, as also a section of Lumsden's battery. In this position we remained for several days, exposed to a constant and galling fire both from the enemy's artillery and sharpshooters, awaiting an evidently contemplated attack upon that point. During this time two of our best lieutenants [[James T.] Hardaway and [N. B.] Lenderman] and Private Suddeth were killed and a number of our men wounded; still, however, we held our position against the most terrific assaults the
