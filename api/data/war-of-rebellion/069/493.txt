forming in rear of your right, to meet an attempt to turn your flank. It was supposed this would bring your right near to Bethesda Church. It was expected that General Burnside would attack the enemy upon his making his appearance near the Via house, for the enemy's presence there is an attempt to turn your flank, which he (General Burnside) was placed on your flank to meet. General Smith will be directed to extend a regiment or two on the road from Woody's to Bethesda Church to meet your extension. The major-general commanding expects you to attack in the morning at the hour appointed.

Major-General MEADE:

I think General Burnside did not succeed in driving the enemy off the Shady Grove road. I remained in position this afternoon and covered their withdrawal but got pretty badly handled myself in consequence. General Burnside, at my suggestion, had gone into position to cover my withdrawal, but the attack of the enemy came on too soon. General Burnside sent out Potter on the right to outflank them on their way toward Linney's, but he accomplished nothing, and his troops holding them in front did nothing either. I suppose the enemy will hardly stay where he is till morning. I hardly know what you would like to have us do under the circumstances. The enemy now have the breast-works we built when we had our fight night before east and we hold their position.

General HUMPHREYS:

I sent Major Roebling to explain our position here at dark. My orders during the day required me to connect with General Smith; that extended my left one division front to reach Woody's, where you said his right was, and I had to take my right division away to do it. The enemy followed up and attacked it as I did so. My orders directed me to have half my forces in hand for contingencies; that required me to withdraw another division and a half, but I was not allowed by the enemy to do it. had these things been done my right would have been thrown so far away from where it now is that General Burnside, to mass in rear of it, would have had to come down to Cold Harbor to get out of the swamp. Your very last dispatch before the wire was cut was explicitly that I should hold the front and right, and let Burnside by free to be used any where. I will do the best I can when morning comes. If the enemy is where he was this evening I shall have to fight him here, for I cannot well withdraw to another position. If he has retired I will close in at once with General Smith. My connection with him now is quite complete.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
