information during night that Hood's army is within eight hours march of my command, and Wheeler trying to effect severance between my command and Cartersville. I await further development and your orders.

Brigadier-General.

General CORSE,Rome:

Can you see the enemy's camp-fires to-night? Do you know any reason why cars should not go through to Chattanooga? All the bridges are done.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

ROME, October 10, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Trains are running through to Chattanooga. A few camp-fire may be seen. Through the day smoke from the enemy's camp was discerned; nothing extensive, however. We will work all night on defenses.

JNO. M. CORSE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, Cartersville, October 10, 1864.

General CORSE,Rome:

Get your men into the strongest forts and hold them. All my army is marching hard straight for Rome. The Twenty-THIRD Corps is now near Cassville, and I will make the others march to-night. Is not the Oostenaula too deep to be forded? I doubt if Hood will put his army on this side of the Oostenaula.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

ROME, GA., October 10, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

My spies and deserters report the following, which is corroborated in different ways: Hood arrived at Cedartown yesterday morning early, and remained until 12 m., cooking two days' rations. Commenced crossing on two pontoon bridges, at Coosaville, at daylight this morning. Wheeler crossed one-half his forces first, followed by Lee's corps and Hardee's, leaving Stewart's and the balance of Wheeler's to cross to-morrow morning. Their destination is Huntsville, &amp;c. They are to attack Rome at dayLight, squelch me and get the stores; then continue the journey. I have had men and women in and through their camps
