THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
163
It is not to be supposed that, in no conceivable
case, shall there be doubt as to whether a given
object be or not, a necessary incident of the mil-
itary, naval, or any other power. * As man is im-
peded so are his methods of uttering his thoughts.
Human language, save in expressions for the
exact sciences, must always fail to preclude all
possibility of controversy. Hence it is that, in one
branch of the subject—the question of the power
of Congress to make appropriations in aid of navi-
gation—there is less of positive conviction than in
regard to the general subject; and it therefore seems
proper, in this respect, to revert to the history of
the> practice of the Government.
Among the very earliest acts of the first session
of Congress, was that for the establishment and
support of light-houses, approved by President
Washington, on the 7th of August, 1789, which
contains the following provisions:
" That all expanses which shall accrue, from am"! after the
fifteenth day of August, one thousand seven hundred and
eighty-nine, ia the nceessary support, maintenance, and
repairs, of all light-houses, beacons, buoys, and public
piers, erected, placed, or sunk, before the passing of this
act, at the entrance of, oi within any bay, inlet, harbor, or
port of the United States, for rendering ihe navigation
thereof easy and safe, shall be defrayed out of the Treasury
of the United States: Provided, nevertheless, That none
of the said expenses shall continue to be so defrayed, after
the expiration of one year from the day aforesaid, unless
such light-houses, beacons, buoys, and public piers, shall,
in the mean Kmc, be ceiled to, and vested in, ihe United
States, by ih« Stale,or States, respectively, in which the
same may be, together with the lands and tenements thi'rc-
onto belonging, and together with the jutisdiction of the
same."
Acts containing appropriations for this class of
public works, were passed in 1791, 1792, 1703,
and so on, from year to year, down to the present
time; and the tenor of these acts, when examined
with reference to other parts of the subject, is
worthy of special consideration.
It is a remarkable fact, that for a period of more
than thirty years after the adoption of the Consti-
tution, all appropriations of tnis class were con-
fined, with scarcely an apparent exception, to the
construction of light-houses, beacons, buoys, and
public pis#*?, ana the stakeage of channels; to
' render navigation " safe and easy," it is true, but
only by indicating to the navigator obstacles in his
way—not by removing those obstacles, nor in any
other respect changing,artificially, the preexisting
natural condition of the earth and sea. It is ob-
vious, however, that works of art for the removal
of natural impediments to navigation, or to pre-
vent their formation, or for supplying harbors
where these do not exist, are also means of ren-
dering navigation safe and easy, and may, in sup-
posable cases, be the most efficient, as well as the
most economical of such means. Nevertheless,
it is not until the year 1824, that, in an act to
improve the navigation of the rivers Ohio and
Mississippi, and in another act making appropri-
ations for deepening the channel leading into the
harbor of Presque Isle, on Lake Eric, and tor
repairing Plymouth beach, in Massachusetts bay,
we have any example of an appropriation for the
improvement of harbors, in the nature of those
provided for in the bill returned by me to the House
of Representatives.
It appears not probable that the abstinence of
Congress in this respect, is attributable altogether
to considerations of economy, or to any failure to
perceive that the removal of an obstacle to naviga-
tion, might be not less useful than the indication
of it for avoidance; and it may be well assumed
that the course of legislation so long pursued was
induced, in whole or in part, by solicitous con-
sideration in regard to the constitutional power
over such matters vested in Congress.
One other peculiarity in this course of legisla-
tion is not less remarkable. It is, that when the
General Government first took charge of light-
houses and beacons, it required the works them-
selves, and the lands on which they were situated,
to be ceded to the United States. And, although
for a time this precaution was neglected in the
case of new works, in the sequel it was provided,
by general laws, that no light-house should be
constructed on any site previous to the juris-
diction over the same being ceded to the United
States.
Constitutional authority for the construction
and support of many of the public works of this
nature, it is certain, may be found in the power of
Congress to maintain a Navy and provide for-the
general defense; but their number, and, in many
instances, their location, preclude the idea of their
being fully justified as necessary and proper inci-
dents of that power. And they do not se«m sus-
ceptible of being referred to any other of the
specific powers vested in Congress by the Con-
stitution, unless it be that to raise revenue, in so
far as this relates to navigation. The practice
under all my predecessors in office, the express
admissions of some of them, and absence of
denial by any, sufficiently manifest their belief,
that the power to erect light-houses, beacons, and
piers, is possessed by the General Government.
In the acts of Congress, as we have already seen,
the inducement and object of the appropriations
are expressly declared: those appropriations being
for " light-houses, beacons, buoys, and public
piers," erected or placed " within any bay, inlet,
harbor, or port of the United States for rendering
the navigation thereof easy and safe."
If it be contended that this review of the history
of appropriations of this class leads to the infer-
ence, that, beyond the purposes of national defense
and maintenance of a Navy, there is authority in
the Constitution to construct certain works in aid
of navigation, it is, at the same time, to be remem-
bered, that the conclusions thus deduced from
cotemporaneous construction and long continued
acquiescence, are themselves directly suggestive
of limitations of constitutionality, as well as ex-
pediency, regarding the nature and the description
of those aids to navigation, which Congress may
provide as incident to the revenue power. For at
this point controversy begins, not so much as to
the principle as to its application.
In accordance with long-established legislative
usage, Congress may construct light-houses and
beacons, and provide, as it does, other means to
prevent shipwrecks on the coasts of the United
States. But the General Government cannot go
beyond this, and make improvements of rivers
and harbors, of the nature, and to the degree, of
all the provisions of the bill of the last session of
Congress.
To justify such extended power, it has been
urged that, if it be constitutional to appropriate
money for the purpose of pointing out, by the
construction of light-houses or beacons, wheie an
obstacle to navigation exists, it is equally so to
remove such obstacle, or to avoid it by the creation
of an artificial channel; that if the object be lawful,
then the means adopted solely with reference to
the end must be lawful, and that, therefore, it is
not material, constitutionally speaking, whether a
given obstruction to navigation be indicated for
avoidance, or be actually avoided by excavating
a new channel; that if it be a legitimate object of
expenditure to preserve a ship from wreck, by
means of a beacon or of revenue cutters, it must
be not less so to provide places of safety by the
improvement of harbors, or, where none exist,
by their artificial construction; and thence the
argument naturally passes to the propriety of
improving rivers for the benefit of internal navi-
gation; because all these objects are of more or
less importance to the commercial, as well as the
naval interests of the United Slates.
The answer to all this is, that the question of
opening speedy and easy communication to and
through all parts of the country is substantially
the same, whether done by land or water; that the
uses of roads and canals in facilitating commercial
intercourse, and uniting by community of interests
the most remote quarters of the country by land
communication, are the same in their nature as the
uses of navigable waters; and that, therefore, the
question of the facilities and aids to be provided to
navigation, by whatsoever means, ia but a sub-
division of the great question of the constitution-
ality and expediency of internal improvements by
the General Government. In confirmation of this,
it is to ba remarked, that one of the most import-
ant acts of appropriation of this class, that of the
year 1833, under the administration of President
Jackson, by including together and providing for,
in one bill, as well as river and harbor works, as
road works, impliedly recognizes the fact that
they are alike branches of the same great subject
of internal improvements.
As the population, territory, and wealth of,the
country increased, and settlements extended into
remote regions, the necessity for additional means
of communication, impressed itself upon all minds
with a force, which had not been experienced at
the date of the formation of the Constitution, and
more and more embarrassed those who were most
anxious to abstain, scrupulously, from any exer-
cise of doubtful power. Hence the recognition,
in the messages of Presidents Jefferson, Madison,
and Monroe, of the eminent desirableness of such
works, with the admission that some of them
could lawfully and should be conducted by the
General Government, but with obvious uncer-
tainty of opinion as to the line between such as
are constitutional and such as are not; such as
ought to receive appropriations from Congress,
and such as ought to be consigned to private enter-
prise, or the legislation of the several States.
This uncertainty has not been removed by the
practical working of our institutions in later times;
for, although the acquisition of additional terri-
tory, and the application of steam to the propul-
sion of vessels, have greatly magnified the import-
ance of internal commerce, this fact has, at the
same time, complicated the question of the power
of the General Government over the present
subject.
In fine, a careful review of the. opinions of all
my predecessors, and of the legislative history of
the country, does not indicate any fixed rule by
which to decide what, of the infinite variety of
possible river and harbor improvements, are within
the scope of the power delegated by the Constitu-
tion; and the question still remains unsettled.
President Jackson conceded the constitutionality,
under suitable circumstances, of the improvement
of rivers and harbors through the agency of Con-
gress; and President Polk admitted the propriety
of the establishment and support, by appropria-
tions from the Treasury, of light-houses, beacons,
buoys, and other improvements, within the bays,
inlets, and harbors of the ocean and lake coasts
immediately connected with foreign commerce.
But, if the distinction thus made rests upon the
differences between foreign and domestic com-
merce, it cannot be restricted thereby, to the bays,
inlets, and harbors of the oceans and lakes, be-
cause foreign commerce has already penetrated
thousands of miles into the interior of the conti-
nent, by means of our great rivers, and will con-
tinue so to extend itself with the progress of set-
tlement, until it reaches the limit of navigability.
At the time of the adoption of the Constitution,
the vast valley of the Mississippi, now teeming
with population, and supplying almost boundless
resources, was literally an unexplored wilderness.
Our advancement has outstripped even the most
sanguine anticipations of the fathers of the Re-
public, and it illustrates the fact, that no rule is
admissible which undertakes to discriminate, so
far as regards river and harbor improvements,
between the Atlantic or Pacific coasts, and thegreat
lakes and rivers of the interior regions of North
America. Indeed, it is quite erroneous to sup-
pose that any such discrimination has ever existed
in the practice of the Government. To the con-
trary of which is the significant fact before stated,
that when, after abstaining from all such appro-
priations for more than thirty years, Congress
entered upon the policy of improving the naviga-
tion of rivers and harbors, it commenced with the
rivers Mississippi and Ohio.
The Congress of the Union, adopting, in this
respect, one of the ideas of that of the Confed-
eration, has taken heed to declare, from time to
time, as occasion required, either in acts for dis-
posing of the public lands in the Territories, or
m acts for admitting new States, that all naviga-
ble rivers within the same " shall bo deemed to
be, and remain, public highways."
Out of this condition of things arose a question
which, at successive periods of our public annals,
has occupied the attention of the best minds in
the Union. This question* is, what waters are
public navigable waters, so as not to bs of State
character and jurisdiction, but of Federal juris-
diction and character, in the intent of the Consti-
tution and of Congress? A proximate, but im-
perfect, answer to this important question is fur-
nished by the acts of Congress and the decisions
of the Supreme Court of the United States, de-
fining the constitutional limits of the maritime
jurisdiction of the General Government. That
jurisdiction is entirely independent of the revenue
power. It is not derived from that, nor is it meas-
ured thereby.
In that act of Congress which, in the first year
of the Government, organized our judicial system,
and-which, whether we look to the subject, the
