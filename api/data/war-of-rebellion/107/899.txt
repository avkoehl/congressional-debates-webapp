enemy broke camp four miles south of Martinsburg and moved in that direction; that General Lee was reported near Winchester and Stuart near Martinsburg. An effort was made to get the bodies of two men buried on Virginia side and from that it leaked out that the application must go to General Lee or Stuart, and in an hour the latter would reply. The men on picket along the river blong the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Virginia Cavalry and some North and South Carolina regiments, all of which are of Stuart's command.*

General R. B. MARCY,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

The cavalry now opposite me is part of Fourth Virginia Cavalry, and is denominated Black Horse Cavalry. Major Kirkland, who has just returned from that side, having been over in connection with the removal of the wounded, thinks that is the only force in the immediate vicinity, and from the application for the bodies of deceased soldiers not having been replied to, that it has gone to General Lee, who must be farther off than suspected. This impression is derived from conversation with the officer in command, though nothing directly to the point was stated or inquired.
