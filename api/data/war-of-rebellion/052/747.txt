Major General W. T. SHERMAN:

Your dispatches of last night and to-day are received. General McPherson has been directed to send out cavalry, as you suggest, You will take every possible means to ascertain the location of the enemy and his movements, and if he has any considerable force of infantry. It is hardly probable that he would move here with any serious design of attacking this place. Still, if he has any considerable force in the vicinity of Clinton it must be dispersed, and it is with a view to this you will collect information. McPherson can spare full 5,000 men, or all you think necessary. Smith's division of his corps is expected back early.

By order of Major General U. S. Grant:

I find in the Mobile evening paper of the 16th:

RICHMOND, September 15.

In the fight at Brandy Station on Sunday, General Stuart's loss was two pieces of horse artillery. The enemy had advanced to the Rapidan, and skirmishing had been going on all day yesterday between the cavalry and sharpshooters. It is thought that a final engagement may occur near Orange Court-House to-day.

This looks as though Meade was advancing on Richmond. Orange Court-House is near Gordonsville.

I have a brigade across the river. There is nothing there.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
