WINCHESTER, VA., November 4, 1861.

General S. COOPER, Adjutant-General C. S. Army:

SIR: I have been here tow weeks, engaged in paying the militia under General Carson and also Colonel McDonald's regiment of cavalry, I consider it my duty as a disbursing officer of the Government to report the condition of things here. I find brigadier-generals in command of regiments instead of brigades, colonels in command of companies instead of regiments, and captains in command of squads instead of consolidating regiments and companies at once and disbanding the supernumerary offices, there freeing the Confederacy of all this unnecessary expense.

The Federals are busily engaged at Romney in shucking corn and thrashing grain. They have, it is reported, one hundred teams hauling off all the grain they can lay their hands on.

I have nearly completed my payment to August 31.

I remain, with great respect, your obedient servant.
