The general commanding directs you to hurry Mitchell's cavalry in upon our right, and send a detachment to look out for our rear.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General McCOOK:

Your dispatch of 1 p.m. received; your dispositions approved. As battle advances prepare to send Negley up here at once, or, if he cannot get ready, send Sheridan. Send urgent order to Mitchell to come down this way, and to send a portion of his force down Chattanooga Valley, and with the balance close down on you. Two brigades of Van Cleve are up supporting Palmer, who has not yet become engaged.

The general commanding directs you to send one division of your corps to Widow Eliza Glenn's, and send forward to report its march to General Thomas, with orders to close up to General Thomas, if he shall so direct. The division will receive orders from General Thomas. General McCool will take command of the right and the cavalry, and hold himself in readiness to support either flank.
