taking up tne bill, he should propose that it be
gone tarough section by section, contenting him-
self at present with s ating briefly the object of
each.
The bill was then taken up and read by sections,
Mr. B. explaining the objects.
The bill having been read through to the fiith
sec ton—
Mr. BARROW rose to inquire if there were not
conflicting provisons between the second and filth
sections The former was important to Louisiana,
a' protecting the ngh'sof married women and mi-
nors, under their pecu'iar system. The law of
Louisiana was p-culia> The rights of wives and
m nors were paramoa t o all other claim ; and
any bankrupt law that might interfere with the«e
rights could never Lave lus support The p op e
of Louisiana were warmly attached to ¡heir own
system, and he did not find it interfered with until
came to the fifth section, where it appeared to him
there was a direct and palpable conflict vith the
system. The fi'th section stated that all creditors
coming m and prtvmg their d;bts under the act
pre-cribed should be entitled to share in the bank-
rupt's effects pro rata, without any priority or pre-
ference whatever. Now, he would inquire of the
c^irman of ihe Committee on the Judiciary whe-
ther th' re was not the co fl ct he had pointed out?
Mr BtRRIEN explr toed that undei the second
s e ion he rights secure 1 o women aud minors un-
|   dei fie peculiar law of the State of Louisiana were
!   noi n-terf red wnh.   The grc at object of a uniform
I, system t f b rkr iptty vas t0 ^ecure the right to all,
,1 and a general law mu t over'ile iiid overrule a'l
,   1 n.'l laws wn cb gave irnpropfr p-tferences to cie-
di ors.    In the filth secuon there had beea distinc-
tions made, but such as under ¡he circumstances
the committee had ihoi/ght just and beneficial    For
instance,  operatives  that  had performed services
within six months of the time cf bankrup cy were
pllowed the limned sum of $25—and all debts due
to ihe tli tied States had a pteference.
Mr HUN FINUTON explained that the sec'ion
h=id been dr^wn ly him, at the last ses ion, and that
i  wa- i tended to   i 'e io  the   States the benefit of
their lrca' liw% but cot 'o give  an inpr >per pre
