General Hill explains how, in his haste to attack the Third Army Corps of the enemy, he overlooked the presence of the Second, which was the cause of the disaster that ensued.

R. E. LEE,

General.

NOVEMBER 24, 1863.

Respectfully submitted to the President.

The disaster at Bristoe Station seems due to a gallant but overhasty pressing on of the enemy.

J. A. SEDDON.

Returned to the Secretary of War.

There war a want of vigilance, by reason of which it appears the Third Army Corps of the enemy got a position, giving great advantage to them.
