HEADQUARTERS,Florence, Ala., November 18, 1864.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Corinth, Miss.:

Jackson's cavalry division could not be now spared from this army without seriously embarrassing the operations of this army. Major-General Wheeler has with him some thirteen brigades of cavalry, which ought to give him a considerable force.

J. B. HOOD,

General.

CORINTH, November 18, 1864.

General J. B. HOOD:

General Taylor will send six 12-pounders, with ammunition, for this place; send, besides batteries called for, six good artillerists, or artillery non-commissioned officers, to take charge of them, for he has no artillerists.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

Sixteen loaded cars are expected here to-night. Major Willis reports empty cars at several depots on road, but no commissary supplies there. Where are your supplies? Every exertion will be used to send forward all collected.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

Dirt road from Tuscumbia to Cherokee is almost impassable. Cars will soon run to Barton Station, six miles beyond Cherokee, ten from Tuscumbia. Could you not throw bridge across river opposite Barton Station and haul thence on north side?

General.
