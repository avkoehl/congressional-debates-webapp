6. Brigadier General G. F. McGinnis, U. S. Volunteers, is hereby relieved from duty with the Nineteenth Army Corps, and will report in person to the major-general commanding the Department of the Gulf for assignment to duty.

By order of Major General E. R. S. Canby:

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

LITTLE ROCK, June 27, 1864.

Colonel J. K. MIZNER,

Commanding, Devall's Bluff:

COLONEL: Price is reported crossing the Saline with 15,000. He is reported at Rockport whit 4,000 and one battery. It is said that Fagan has twenty-three pieces. They say they are going to give us a fourth of July celebration. Is there any news from General Carr? I shall not order the force to Augusta as he requests, for the present, at least, and he better not go beyond the reach of my dispatches. I wish you would let me know if there is a fast boat at your post that could be sent with dispatches to General Canby. Ask Captain Bache if it is safe for boats to go out of White River now without convoy. I will send you instructions as soon as your answer is received.

FRED'K STEELE,

Major-General.
