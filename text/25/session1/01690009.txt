Senate.
jeet embraced in the Message and Treasury report,
both of «Inch, he believed, hid suggested that it
ought to be determined in what kinds of funds the
revenue should be collected It was now an-
nounced by the chairman that no communication
from the committee would be made on the subject
Mr R would therefore proceed on the assumption
that the commi'tee intended to leave the laws on
that subject as they now are, and that being the
case, and Mr E be'ievmg that all the measures
proposed and to be pioposed would have a mutual
bearing and dependente on each other, and believ-
ing it to be infinitely more important to the countrj
tnat what Congress should do snould be well done,
rather than done quickl}, Mr R moved that w hen
the Senate adjourned it should adjourn to meei on
Monday next, that all the bills reponed on the sub-
ject might be examined, compared, and carefully
considered by members before the Senate came to
act on them Mr R said it was as inconvenient
for him to remain here as it would be for an} one,
but whatever the inconvenience, he preferíed
that a'l measures should be duly and amply consi-
dered
Mr N1LES said that he regietted the honorable
Senator fiom Virginia (Mr Rives) shculd have
felt it his duty to ask for a further deliy of die bus -
ness before the Senate, bv a motio i for adjourn-
ment until next week When the first bid was le-
ported by the Committee of Fimnce several dajs
smce, the Senator from South Carolina (Mi Cal-
houn) suggested tint it would be inexpedient to act
on that or any single mensure, until we had before
us all the bills which w ere to be expectted from
that committee relating to important subjects, pre
sented in the Message oí t! e Piesident The ne
cessity of this course although he behci o 1 doubted
by some was generallj acqurscl m Smce then
the committee have íepoited a in rber of b lis for
carrying out all the great measures recommended
in the Message, which they deem it important to
be acted upon during the present session, and the
chairman has informed us that they do not intend
to report any more bills If his distinguished
friend from Virginia, or any other Senator, thought
that the bills reported did not cover the whole
ground, they would of course have an oppoitunity
to supply the deficiency
But (said Mr N ) the whole subjects are befóte
ns, if not in the bills reported, the} are submitted
m the Message Our whole work is before us,
we now see what is to be done, and he thought that
it nas our duty to enter upon it without further de-
lay We are now in the last haKof tne second
week, and have done nothing, and it is proposed
to adjourn over to the third u eek before w e enter
upon the business for which we have been conven-
ed He did not complain of the del a} so far, but,
on the contrary, w ould say, for he thought it due to
them, that the committee to whom the grave ?nd
important subjects contained in the Message had
been submitted, had been remarkably faithful and
industiious m the discharge of their duties They
had pel formed their service, and it now remained
for us to enter upon ours, which he hoped would
be done wifhoat further delay Congress had been
assemble 1 at an extnoidinary conjuncUie toper-
form a special service, and he hoped, now we had
the work before us, that we should enter upon it,
andcontinue our labors with diligence and perse-
verance, so as to despatch the business, ana close
the session as soon as was consistent with the full
deliberation and reasoí al le discussion due to the
important subjects before us
But we are told by the honorable Senator fiom
Virginia, that the several subjects aie so connected,
that we can not, w ith propriety act upon one, with-
out an opportunity to examine aid compare them,
and make up our mmds upon the whole He
wishes time for examination, reflection, and con-
sultation But he (Mr N ) thought there had al-
ready been sufficient time Jcr these purr os s and
he did not consider that there was much connec ion
between the bul tor postponing the fouith deposite
to the States, «Inch would be acted upon to-daj,
and the several bills that the honorable chairman
of the Committee on Finante had just reported
Sir, said Mr N we have been called here at
an extraordinary emergency, when the business of
the country was deranged, and the public mind in
an unsettled and feverish state, the expectations of
the people aie excited, the e}es of the whole coun-
try are upon us At such a time, anil under such
circumstances, Congress cannot remain in session
without a prodigious influence for good o. for evil,
and he greatly feared it would be the latter A
protiacted session he w as persuaded w ould tend to
agitate and disturb the pub'is mind, already suf-
ficiently unsettled, that could hardly fail of increas-
ing existing difficulties, which depended much, if
not mairly, on a general want of confidence
Would gentlemen prolong ihe present, so as to run
it into the regular annual session' He hoped no
one was disposed to do this, nothing m hi« opi-
nion eoul 1 have a more injurious pffeet He was
sensible of the great and mom°ntous importance
of the subjects before Congicss, and was as desir-
ous as any ore could be, that time should be allow-
ed for the.r full consideration and reasonable dis-
cussion, but he believed it due to the country that
we enter upon this at once, and continue our la-
bors with diligence, so as to bring the session to i
close as soon as possible He theiefoie hoped that
the Senate would now take up the bill for the post-
ponement of the fourth instalment to the States,
winch was the older oí the day
Mr WRIGHT «aid he had no disposition him-
self, nor did he piesume tneconmittee had, to press
tn s subject prematurely on the Senate The com-
mutee, after a fill and free consultation with the
head of the Titasury Department, had submitted
all the measures u Inch had been the uiht indispen-
sable at this time to the public welfare Mr W
said the know ledge he had dtnv ed fi c m that depart-
ment sht w ed the necessity of speedy action on the
fist t \o bill reported in 1 with wInch the others
h*  I n~  immcdii c comeet n M W th u0ht i
all impoitant that tmsbi'l (po tp miisg Pie pigment
of the fourth instalment) should be considered
without delay, and he wished therefora to be ab
solved from any disposition to press this subject
improperly on the Senate It was the necessity of
the adoption of this measure that made him so
anxious for its speedy pass ige
Mr RIVES said nothing was further from him
than to suspect his honorable fnend of a > such
disposition, he knew too well his habits and that
gentlemanly courtesy that had alvva}s distinguish-
ed him to haiboi *.uch a thought forone moment, but
thehonorab' gentleman must recollect that he has
told u^ that he his hid lull communic tionwith
the Secretaiy of the Tieasury, and derived infor-
mation! rom nat enlightened officer on the subject,
wmch ne (Mr R) had not had He was in-
duced, therefore, to ask for a mrment's considera-
tion, that he might consult his own mind delibe-
rately, and not as his friend froxi Connecticut had
insinuated, for private consultation He stood
here alone, and had no consultation pritpte or
public He s ood here on the sole responsib lit) of
a Senator of Virginia Mi R. could not, like the
Senator from Connecticut, deem that his whole
duty w as finished w hen the Government w as re-
lies ed He came heie for otnerand higher pur-
poses as well is that, to wit the lehe^of the people,
a id he ugretted, that m all the measures set foith
by the Committee on Finance, ihere w as not one
that looked ton aids tnat object It wat not his ntent
tion to c?st any reproaches upon the committee bu
he could not but express hisiegiet that not a sólita
ry measure had been proposed calculated to bnr£
lelief to th-  people it might he ver) convenient
to come here and register the edicts m favor of the
Government and then go home again, but it was
'us fixed determination, if possible before he left
he Senate that something should be done at least
o ameliorate, if not to relieve the dis're s un 'er
w hich the w hole nation groaned If the commit-
tee w ould not piopose some measure calculated to
benefit the people, he would andertake it, all incom-
petent a« he felt himstlf to such a task Tneguat
desideiatum, in his op nion, was, to restore public
confidence, that once done, indh° \erilj believed
it could be done, the upturn would rise at once to
hei wonted gladness and pre spent} I he gentle-
man from Connecticut had said something about
economy to the Government, and «aving ot time
and expense, but he put it to thai gentleman to say,
whether such matteu were rot a mere infle, when
compared w ith the great interests of the people If
economy were a matter of so much consideration,
it would be better to save the mileage, and go at
once to the current business of the country No
man was subject to mce personal inconvenience
than he was, from attention to his legislative duties
at tms inconvenient season—nevertheless, he was
ready to sacrifice himself upon the altar of his
country, if by so doing he could insure the antici-
pated relief Now was the time, above all others,
for the action of the Senate—when the elemen's of
of i elief and national prosperity w ere dormant, and
w ailed only the breath of Congress to wake them
to life and activity Mr R appealed to the Senate
foi such relief as the distresses of the people de-
manded, for his own part, he felt almost disposed
to swear like the members of the National Assem-
bly of France, that he would not go home until the
people were relieved
Mr CALHOUN was deeply impressed with the
magnitude and danger of the present emergency
It, however, had not taken him by surprise, ner
was it unlooked for by him In his humble
opinion, of the many difficulties through which the
country had passed within the last fh e and twenty
years, this was by far the most distressing and over-
whelming Seeing and behtving this, he had
come here with a full and fixed determination to
do his duty despite of all pergonal considerations
and party feeling, for, when his country was in dan-
ger, he knew but one imp use, and that was to per-
form his dutv He had been looking torn ard with
the most intinse anxiety for the remedy which
would be proposed Fixing two great points m his
t mind, he had observed the most stnct reserve until
he saw the plan of the administration Having
"o\\ seen ir he felt that the onlv feature m the
Message and m the report of the Secretary of the
Treasurv, which gave character to the present bill,
was to be abandoned Tor himself, while he was
ready to act on this understanding, he must say,
that with regard to the other measures, he regard-
ed them as nothing—as perfectly immateiial And
he wou'd tell gentlemen that this was not a crisis
foi weak action They had a difficult °cene to go
through, and if they did not meet it with prompt-
ness and boldness, they would find it no ea-y matter
to oí ercome He professed himself prepared to
act immediately on the bill before the Senate
Mr WEBSTER said that he had ?lread} ex-
pressed his purpose and that vvjs, to throw no
obstruction in the- way of the adoption of such
measures as the majority of the Senate might
give their sanction to, and which they proposed as
a remedy for the public distresses In pursuance
of that pledge, he felt himself bound to give as
early an opportunity of considering them as was
consistent with deliberative legislation That which
gov erned him ¿n this case, to a considerable degree,
was the apprehension (perhaps ill-founded, but still
it was an apprehension,) that the measures pro-
posed were not likely to obtain the assent of Con-
gress that it might be necessary to resort to other
measures In the mean time, he was as ready as
the Senator f m Virginia to lemam here lfneces-
sirv, uitil Ma} next but, whatevei procrastination
or postponement was indulged in here, was a pro-
tection of the evils oppiessmg the community.
He hoped, then, hat the Smalor from Virginia
v ould agree to consent that the measure first intro-
duced shou'd be brought before the Senate and
acted upon, because the other measures, were de-
pendent upon it Tne first step, in his opinion,
which thev had to decide, was wliether the pay-
ment of the fourth instalment shou'd be postponed,
because the period was close at hand when that
instalment was to b" paid It seemed to him that
everv con=iJera'ion suggested the propriety of dis-
posing of this measure in one way or the other.
In short he felt bound to those whom he repre-
sented, whom he knew to be m veiy great anxiety,
and who % ere suffer np much dist<e s, to give a
fair and prompt opportunity for a trial of these
measnr trerore Congress, and, if they should fail,
let others be subsliluted for them which were cal-
culated to give relief to the distrcs of the commu-
nity
Mr  RIVES behe\ ed, from the expression of
