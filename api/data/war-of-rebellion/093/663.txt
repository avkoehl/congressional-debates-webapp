RICHMOND, VA., March 10, 1865.

General J. B. HOOD,

Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: In compliance with your request, made a few days since, in reference to the strength of the Army of the Tennessee at the time you left Tupelo, Miss., I respectfully submit that, according to my recollection of a field return of the army which was being made at that time, and finished a day or two after your departure, the effective total of the infantry and artillery was about 15,000 - perhaps a few hundred less. This return was made after the West Tennessee regiments of Major-General Cheatham's corps had been furloughed, as well as some men furloughed under an order published at Tupelo, and some small organizations also furloughed at Tupelo. I cannot form any estimate of the numbers of men thus furloughed, because you will remember that all the organization furloughs were given by the corps commanders, your sanction having been previously obtained; consequently the strength of such organizations at the time they were furloughed was not furnished the assistant adjutant-general's office at army headquarters.

The field return above referred to was sent to Colonel Brent, and was in his office in Augusta when I passed there a few weeks since.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. P. MASON,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Indorsement.]

Crossed Tennessee, November 21, 30,600 men.
