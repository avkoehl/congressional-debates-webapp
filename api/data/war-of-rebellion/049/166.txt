[CHAP. XLI.

CLARKSBURG,

September 10, 1863.

Brigadier-General AVERELL,

Beverly:

Colonel Campbell reports that his cavalry captured 6 of Imboden's men at Moorefield yesterday. From these prisoners he received such information as leads him to the belief that the late attack on Moorefield was only a feint to cover a movement farther west. Keep your scouts well out and on the alert. Do you know if Jackson's forces have returned to Huntersville?

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE SUSQUEHANNA,Chambersburg, September 10, 1863.

Colonel J. C. KELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army Headquarters:

I respectfully state, for the information of the General-in-Chief, that the enemy are apparently making preparations for a movement of some kind into Pennsylvania. Their spies have been through this county within a few days. My impression is that a raid is intended.

The General-in-Chief is aware that my force is small, one company of infantry, one battery, and three companies of horse in this county; two of cavalry and one of infantry at Gettysburg and vicinity.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

The authority of Chaplain James will be respected in all matters relating to the welfare of the colony.
