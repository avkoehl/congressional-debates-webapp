General R. E. LEE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

Colonel Mulford report to Colonel Ould that there were now but negro troops on this side, and my scouts are seeking more reliable information. The gun-boats of the enemy would probably prevent any effort on this side being attended with decided results. I think, therefore, that it would be better for us to re-enforce the south side if the troops can be spared from this side.

Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

General Field reports the usual drumming in the enemy's camp, but not so much noise of bugles. Our scouts cannot enter the enemy's lines; there are some white troops on this side, but we are unable to ascertain the number. Colonel Elliott, General C. Lee's field officer of the day, reports indications of some increase in the force on this side in the last day or two. We have no positive information, however. Other scouts will go out to-night. I think it probable that General Sheridan may have taken Kautz's cavalry, as they were fresh, and left a portion of his own in their place. We shall be prepared to join you or to send any of our troops as soon as ordered.
