HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Atlanta, Ga., September 26, 1864.

Brigadier General John NEWTON,

Chattanooga, Tenn.:

General Thomas says dispose of your troops as ordered, and then you can obey the orders received from General Sherman. Is the assistant adjutant-general of General Steedman at Chattanooga?

SOUTHARD HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CHATTANOOGA, September 26, 1864.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Commanding Department of the Cumberland:

General Milroy wishes that my troops should go to him. Such not being in accordance with written and verbal instructions received from you, I respectfully report the matter.

JNO NEWTON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Second Div., Forth Army Corps.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Atlanta, Ga., September 26, 1864.

Brigadier General John NEWTON,

Chattanooga:

The troops of General Steedman's command are to go to the tunnel, Elk River bridge, Tullahoma, and Duck River bridge when relieved by yours. If there is no officer in Chattanooga to give them the necessary orders, please do so yourself by my command. Strong guards should be at the tunnel, Elk River bridge, and Duck River bridge, and the reserves at Tullahoma. Your troops are to garrison Chattanooga, Running Water, and Bridgeport.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.

CHATTANOOGA, September 26, 1864-3. 15 p. m.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

Pursuant to your instructions, I have already directed the movements of all troops that, in my present judgment, can be spared from the lines between Bridgeport and this place, and have directed them to report where I understand General Milroy desires them. The troops that now remain are my own and a small number of the old garrison, and, under present circumstances, I do not think any more ought to be sent. I understand that 2,500 men were sent from the garrison previously, and to-day four regiments more. This is the last of three dispatches sent you since my arrival here.

JNO NEWTON,

Brigadier-General.
