QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., February 9, 1864.

Brigadier General Q. A. GILLMORE,

Commanding Department of the South:

GENERAL: By a statement prepared in this office there appears to have been employed by the quartermasters' department in the Department of the South, during the month of November, 1863:

Tons.

Steamers with an aggregate tonnage of................. 16,835

Sailing vessels with an aggregate tonnage of.......... 5,544

------

Total................................................. 22,379

The number of troops in the Department of the South, I am informed at headquarters, was in November, 1863, 37,542, being about eleven-nineteenths ton to a man.

This appears to be more than can be necessary for the ordinary transportation of such a force. Cannot this immense expenditure be reduced with safety? The Government suffers under this drain.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General.

JACKSONVILLE, FLA., February 9, 1864.

Colonel ABBOTT,

Seventh New Hampshire Volunteers:

COLONEL: The major-general commanding directs that you proceed at once with your regiment and report to Brigadier General T. Seymour.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. L. M. BURGER,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

ON BOARD STEAMER BEN DE FORD,

Jacksonville, Fla., February 10, 1864.

Rear-Admiral J. A. DAHLGREN,

Commanding S. Atlantic Blockading Squadron, Saint John's River:

ADMIRAL: I received, some miles from here, your letter stating that you intended to leave this locality, and that three gun-boats would remain in the Saint John's. That force is ample. The enemy will not make any resistence in East Florida for the present. They are panic-stricken.

My advance will be 50 miles from this place to-night. We have taken eight good field pieces well supplied with ammunition, a number of cars, a large quantity of cotton, and ohter valuable property. I am very busy, or I would come and see you. I shall return to Hilton head Saturday next.

Please accept my thanks for prompt co-operation afforded me, and belive me, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.
