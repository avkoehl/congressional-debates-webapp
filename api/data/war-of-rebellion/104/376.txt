Major-General HALLECK,

Washington:

I last night forwarded to General Grant General Wilson's official report of the capture of Selma, Ala., by his corps.* I shall to-day send him orders to hold Selma and operate west of the Alabama River against Taylor's forces, with a view of aiding General Canby as much as possible. Have I authority to propose the same terms to General Taylor and all other Confederate forces that General Grant proposed to General Lee?
