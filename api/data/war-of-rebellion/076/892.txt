Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

I thank you for your kind expressions in your dispatch of the 17th. If General S. D. Lee can co-operate with me by breaking the enemy's communication, I ask that it may be done with the least possible delay, I shall at all times be glad to receive any advice or suggestions from the authorities at Richmond.

J. B. HOOD,

General.

ATLANTA, July 19, 1864.

JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

I need a commander for my old corps. I have assigned Major-General Cheatham to it, although he did not desire it. I have no major-general in that corps whom I deem suitable for the position, and it was Hardee's opinion that Cheatham was the best man at my disposal, my corps commanders concurring also. It is my opinion that if the Department has no more fitting person in view and no strong objection thereto, that Major-General Mansfield Lovell might be assigned here for the purpose, to the great advantage of this army. If a lieutenant-general is to be appointed and sent to me, I know of no one that I would prefer to Major General Wade Hampton or S. D. Lee.

J. B. HOOD,

General.
