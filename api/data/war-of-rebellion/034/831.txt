LEXINGTON, July 29, 1863.

GENERAL: No news during the night. I have concentrated 2,200 mounted men and a battery, will move them against the enemy soon as possible, not later than noon to-day. Many of the troops are now much fatigued, and a great many horses are without shoes. Will remedy all deficiencies as far and soon as possible. Will put either Sanders or Hascall in command. I do not believe the enemy has yet crossed the river. If he does, or if he remains until to-night, I think we will add them to Morgan's command. Troops arrived at Paris at 12, and here this morning.

LEXINGTON, July 29, 1863.

GENERAL: The enemy took Winchester about 10 a. m; his whole force has left Richmond. Reports of his strength are still, as at first, quite contradictory. Sanders is or one the Winchester pike, with directions to watch well in the direction of Paris, and to push forward with directions to watch well in the direction of Paris, and to push forward with all possible dispatch till he reaches the enemy. I believe the enemy's strength is from 2,000 to 2,500, with eight pieces of artillery, under Scott. Four thousand infantry are reported in Knox County, Kentucky, but informant does not believe report.

LEXINGTON, July 30, 1863.

GENERAL: Received dispatch from Sandes, dated 6.40 p. m. yesterday; nothing since. he had then just got a force across Red River, on the Irvine road; had only 1 man wounded and had captured 15 prisoners. After leaving Winchester, the rain had made the road so difficult that the artillery could with difficulty get along; the heaviest pieces were left with a guard, and instructions to come along as fast as possible. Enemy had abandoned a number of wagons on the road. Sanders' force, sent to Paris, lost its way, and has not yet arrived. Have ordered the Fifth East Tennessee and what is at Paris, with battery, to Richmond, and will send there those that are on trains now. Enemy who was at Paris went in direction of Mount Sterling.

GENERAL: Have just [received] the following from Sanders:

IRVINE, KY., July 30, 1863-12 m.

I have just arrived at this place, after 48 miles marching in twenty-two hours, over very rough muddy roads. We fought the rear of the enemy, and drove them all the way from Winchester; killed and wounded 10 or 15, and took 60 or 80 prisoners. The enemy had crossed all their stock and men, except the rear guard, before we got here, and selected a position on the other, side from which we have driven his artillery; skirmishing is still going on. It is absolutely necessary for me to stop here and feed
