HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, June 17, 1864.

General THOMAS,

Present:

Get down to your command as soon as you can this morning, and if you can put your whole army between the two wings of the enemy, do it; or if he show a force on Kenesaw, push his center and try to get on the Marietta and Vining's Bridge road - that is, to the rear of Marietta. I do believe that if he has given up that ridge he has given up the position of Kenesaw or Lost Mountain, and let him choose either. We can get between him and his base without uncovering ours. I will visit McPherson's front to watch the effects, and want you in case Johnston maneuvers outside of intrenched lines to press him close up, whilst I cause McPherson and Schofield to strike him in some exposed point.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
