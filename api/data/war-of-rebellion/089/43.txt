HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, Peebles' House, October 2, 1864-11.50 a. m.

General AYRES:

If you think you can take the fort at the Davis house give it a trial, and if captured hold it. It will develop what the enemy is doing. Everything but cavalry, as far as we have found out, has left this neighborhood.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
