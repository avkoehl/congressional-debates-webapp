Colonel BECKWITH,

Chief Commissary of Subsistence, Atlanta:

Come to Rome and to me, in the field, for consultation. Don't accumulate more than thirty days' supply anywhere, except at Chattanooga. Rather diminish than increase our supplies, and send back all surplus and worthless stores. Hood is now at Blue mountain, and Forrest over about the head of navigation on the Tennessee.

Brigadier General A. B. DYER,

Chief of Ordnance, U. S. Army:

The cavalry of this DIVISION is to be organized into a corps, under Major-General Wilson, and 20,000 men are expected to be kept mounted in the field. The arms at present are of various calibers, and it is very desirable to bring them to something like uniformity. Ten thousand Spencer carbines, with accouterments complete, or if these cannot be obtained, Sharps; 10,000 sets of horse equipments, complete; 10,000 light cavalry sabers and belts, and 300 rounds of ammunition per carbine are requested to be sent to Captain Townsend, at Nashville, as soon as possible, to refit this cavalry. Please inform me by telegraph if this order can be filled, and when.
