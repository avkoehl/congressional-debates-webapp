W.] Higgins, [Company G], that I was the senior officer present, I took command of the regiment. The regiment was then ordered to the support of Colonel Simpson, of the Fourteenth Regiment South Carolina Volunteers, who occupied a position in the open field on the left, where we remained until after dusk, when hostilities had ceased for the night. The regiment was then ordered to the woods a few hundred yards to the rear, where it bivouacked for the night.

SEPTEMBER 30, 1862.

SIR: I hereby transmit a report of the part taken by the First South Carolina Rifles in the battle of Manassas on Saturday, September [August] 30:

The regiment was ordered to a position some 400 yards to the left of the one occupied by it on Friday, with orders to send forward pickets some 200 yards in advance, then remain and watch the movements of the enemy. Constantly during the day our pickets were fired upon by those of the enemy and the fire returned. About 12 m. the enemy advanced in considerable force, driving our pickets back, when they were repulsed by McIntosh's battery, which was in position immediately in our rear. The regiment was then ordered to change its front by a left half-wheel and advance some 150 yards into the corn field, where we remained until after dark, when I was ordered to withdraw my pickets and retire to the old field in rear and bivouac for the night.

Casualties of the day: Killed, none; wounded, none.

All of which is respectfully submitted by--

G. McD. MILLER,

Captain, Commanding First South Carolina Rifles.

Colonel J. W. LIVINGSTON,

First South Carolina Rifles.
