Mr. EDMUNDS. I should like to hear that
bill read through in the regular way. I am
very much pleased with it' as far as it has gone,
because I think the Indians, from the discus-
sion this afternoon, ought to have mail facili-
ties more numerously than any other people
in the United States: but I should like to hear
that bill, if it has not been read through, read
through in the regular way, so that we may
understand what it is.
The PRESIDING- OFFICER. The Secre-
tary will read the bill.
The Chief Clerk read the bill at length.
# The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
tion now is on the first amendment reported
by the Committee on Po$t Offices and Post
Roads, which has been read.

tee on Indian Affairs is now in the Senate. Let
us proceed with the Indian appropriation bill.
Mr. RAMSEY. No; the reading of the bill
is now through.
Mr. COLE. It will take some time to con-
sider it.
Mr. SHERMAN. It is not necessary to
read the post route bill. This is the first time
I have ever heard it read in my life.
Mr. RAMSEY. It is a most extraordinary
thing that it should be insisted upon.
# The PRESIDING OFFICER*. The ques-
tion is on the first amendment reported by the
Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. RAMSEY. I suggest that the vote be
