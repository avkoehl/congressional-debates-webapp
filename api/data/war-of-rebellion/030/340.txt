MURFREESBOROUGH, January 19, 1863.

Major-General WRIGHT, Cincinnati:

The general commanding thinks that if you can collect those troops at Louisville, they had better be sent up the Cumberland River in transports. He will endeavor to make arrangements to do it, and he thinks there will be important work for them to do.

G. P. THRUSTON,

Captain and Acting Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO, Cincinnati, Ohio, January 19, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS, Murfreesborough, Tenn.:

I think Granger's command should go to Nashville, and I will send them by boats via the Cumberland. They can get off by end of week, if steamers can be had. You must keep these troops together as a part of the Army of Kentucky. This is due to Granger and myself. You must send all available steamers at once to Louisville, as all the boats have been taken off the river.

H. G. WRIGHT,Major-General, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, January 19, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Something must be done to clean out the rebels at the Shoals. There is a large force there, and will burn every fleet we send down the river. Do you indorse my reply to the Secretary of War, relating to the Anderson Cavalry?*
