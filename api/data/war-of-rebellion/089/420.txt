As soon as he does so you will move to the left. You will hold yourself in readiness to move to your left in case we are attacked, whether relieved by General Weitzel or not.

Brigadier-General AMES,

Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to say that General Weitzel has been ordered to withdraw. He will pass in your rear, probably close behind, so that his troops will be within supporting distance. As soon as his rear passes your right, you will break off your right brigade to the left and rear, and the other brigades successively, so that you may be able during the movement to form two lines in case of an attack.

Very respectfully, &c.,

WM. P SHREVE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,October 28, 1864.

Very respectfully, & c.,

WM. P. SHREVE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

You will cross the Darbytown road, forming in rear of General Foster's division.
