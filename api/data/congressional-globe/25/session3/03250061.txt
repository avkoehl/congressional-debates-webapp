Graduation Billâ€”Mr, Fulton,
Senate.
muted to purchase, in exclusion of all other peo-
ple, the small tracts of land on which they have |
bett'led.at %l 2o per acre     In other words, that
the snecu'ators wno attend the public sales shall
not be peimitted to purchase these pool men out
of house and home, and thusconvertta theirown
benefit the toil and the danger which they have
endured, in erecting cabins and cultivating spots
of giound beyond the limits of  civilization, to '
she ter and support themselves and their families
This bill  proposes  to   ingraft anothei, though
a similai, principle upon the land system     Itpio-
poses to sell to the poor settler, in smail quanti
ties, such of the public lands as ha\e remained '
unsold for more than five or tenyeais,at a reduc-
tion of price, m the first case, of twenty live cents,
and, in the last, of fifty cents per acre     This tri-
fling boon, if such it may be considered, will not
affect the geneial system.    It is a small depaiture
from it, in favoi of a meritorious class, which time
and circumstances, and the condition of the new
States, have rendeied necessary     It is one which
we should most cheerfully grant, and he felt pei-
fectly convinced that his constituents would nevei
condemn him for giving such a vote      Whilst
these were his sentiments in regard to this partic-
ular matter, he was by no means preparea at the
present moment to unsettle the settled policy of
the Government m regard to the general disposi
lion and sale of the public lands.
Mr B should now proceed to make some re-
marks in regaid to that portion of the Senator's
amendment which proposed to distribute the pro-
ceeds of the public lands, after the 1st day of July,
1840, among the several States At an early period
of his congressional career, he had been friendly
to a similar measure When the Senator had last
brought forward his distribution bill, he (Mr C )
had voted for it, though he was then acting under
instructions fiom the Legislature of Pennsylvania
11 was, however, proper, to say that he never would
have been the agent in giving such a. vote, had he
deemed the measure to be unconstitutional Such
had not then been his opinion, nor was it so now
Should this measure hereafter be pressed, at a
period when our finances were in a condition to
render the revenue derived from the public lands
unnecessary for the support of the Government,
he would decide upon the question, as it might
then be presented, under all the existing circum-
stances At the present moment, he was decidedly
opposed to the Senator's amendment Our reve-
nue was now scarcely sufficient, with the utmost
economy, to meet our expenditures There were
still eight millions of outstanding lreasury notes,
which must shortly be ledeemed The Florida
war, which was such a fruitful source of expend-
iture, had not yet been terminated He might
enumerate other causes of extraordinary expend-
iture Heasked, wasthisa moment to passabill
which would deprive the Government of the reve
nue derived from the public lands' He would
never consent to place the Administration and the
country in such a dilemma The Senator seemed
to beawaieof this difficulty, and,m order to over-
come it, had expressed the opinion that before
July, 1840, the revenue derived from customs
would be sufficient of itself for our expenditures,
without the aid of the public lands He was sorry
that he could not entertain the same opinion We
all know that, under the compromise act, the rate
of duties imposed on foreign imports was sinking
every two years Was this a moment, then, when
our expenses must be necessarily great, to lop off
the revenue derived frqm the public lands, and
give it away to the States' He thought not He
firmly believed that, if this measure should be
adopted, we must either create a national debt or
increase the tariff But the Senator says, let us
pass the bill now, and if, at the first session of the
next Congress, it should be found necessaiy, we
can then suspend or repeal the act Now, for
himself, he believed it to be the-part of wisdom to
wait until the finances of the-country were m such
a condition as to justify the withdrawal of the
proceeds of the public lands from the public Treas-
ury, before we should take the question into seri-
ous consideration It would be miserable policy
to spend time in enacting a law at this session,
which we had reason to believe we might be com-
pelled to repeal at the very next session, and that,
more especially, as the benator did not propose
that his distubution should take effect until the 1st
day ot July, 1840 In any view of the case, there
was no propriety in acting upon the subject at the
present sessiin of Congress, and if tne attempt
were persisted in, it would only consume impouaiit
tim , and pi event us from passing othei laws of
pressing necessity
ihe benaioi says that the expenditures of this
Government have mcieased enormousiy, and un-
less tne Admmistiation should use more economy,
an increase of the tanff would be inevi able He
had heaid the samedeclaia ion ovei and ovei again
on this fiooi, fiom Opposition Senators, since the
commencement of the present session It was the
easiest thing in the world to make general charges
of wastelul expenditure, and by compaung the
aggiegate amount of expendituies for the last few
years with that of former times, to present a plau-
sible statement for the purpose of alarming the
feais of the people. But, do we not all know the
causes of this increased expenditure' We have
had to pro&ecute a most expensive war inFlouda,
anu is there any man in the country who would
say that this war ought to be arrested, that the
United States ought to cower before the prowess
of the Seminole Indians, and ihat the frontier
should be exposed to then merciless depredations
for the sake of saving money ' This war, then,
has been one souice of increased expense An-
other cause which greatly increased the aggregate
amount of oui expenditure for the last fewyeais
was the vast sums of money which, in our libeial
policy, we had paid foi the extinguishment ot the
Indian title to lands within the difierent States
Who regrets tins' Who would not now pulque
the same course under the same circumstances '
And yet all this expendituie has been cnaiged to
the extravagance ot the present Administiation
He had seen estimates ot the gioss amount annu-
ally expended by this Administration, which,
strange as it may seem, actually included as an
item of their extiavagance the millions of indem-
nities which the late Administration had procured
from foreign nations for Amencan merchants
These had first been paid into the Treasury, and
were afterwards paid out to those entitled to re
ceive them under the difftient treaties, and these
very disbuisements were one item to 'swell the
apparent aggiegate of the account cunent against
the Admmistiation, and to prove that it was a
most extravagant Administration The money
collected from foreign Governments, by the vigor- '
ousand successful diplomacy of Geneial Jackson,
was thus used for the purpose of proving a chaige ,
of profligate extravagance against his successor '
If the Senator desires to test the question whether 1
he or I are the most economical, 1 am ready for I
the trial Let him point to any single expenditure
which can, with justice to the country, be reduced,
and if I shall not go as far as he will, then hemay
brand me with the charge of wasteful extrava
gance Will he reduce the Army ' Are twelve
thousand men too gieat an army for a nation of
fifteen millions of people'
[Here Mr Clay, said it was, and that he would
reduce it ]
Mr B resumed Twelve thousand men too
numerous, with a sea-coast stretching from Can
ada to the Gulf of Mexico, and thence to the Sa-
bine, with the Florida war on hand to the South,
and Indian hostilities threatened along our whole
western border, and with the task of preserving
our neutral relations thiougnout the whole extent
of our Canada frontier' Reduce the Army, with
an inland boundaiy of thousands and thousands
of miles, and without any certainty that war may
not rage along its whole extent before the end of
another year' Why, sir, a sufficient number of
men are scarcely left on the sea-board, I will not
say to garrison our fortifications, but meiely to j
take care of them, and keep up the police neces-
sary foe their preservation Why, it is a subject
of astonishment for the whole world that our Army
is so small Now, sir, I do not believe that the
Senator himself, after a moment's reflection, would
reduce the Army below twelve thousand men, and
if he did, I feel confident that, great as is his in-
fluence here, he could not find four Senators of the
whole body to sustain him in theattempt. Then,
if the expenditures for the Army cannot be less-
ened, would tl e Senator wish to reduce the Â¡Navy,
which is the pride and the best defense of the na-
tion from foreign aggression' Have we too many
vessels of war, or are theie too many of them in
commission for tne piotectioi, of oui commerce'
S think the Senatoi will not answei in tne affiim-
ative The Army and Navy aie notoriously the
chief causes of oui permanent expendituie, and if
they canooi be reduced, is it not unjust to cnaige
the Admin stration with extraiogance in main-
taining tnem' But the Senator complains thit the
expenses of our civil list at ihe origin of the Gov-
ernment did not exceed j>6G0,00Q, and now they
have gteatly inn eased He might as well com
pl<un that the coat, which was sufficient to cover
a child in its mfinr-y, was not large enough for
the same purpose after it had grown to the dimen-
sions of a giant Since then we have doubled the
number of States of the Union, and quadrupled
our population, and extended in every form our
foieign and domestic relations, and yet the Sen-
atoi would have us expend no more money on the
civil list than in the cays of our infancy Now,
economy was a homely virtue It did not deal m
generals, but in particulars It saved wherevei it
could One of the most extravagant men he had
ever known was one of the most powerful preach-
ers of economy in the general If the Senator can
neither reduce the Army, nor the Navy, nor the
rumber of those employed in civil service, then I
would ask him to lay his hand upon any abuses
which may exict in either service Let Iiim (said
Mi B ) descend fiom generals to particulars,and
I shall go with him Let him point to any Ã­ndi-
udual instance of extravagance, with which the
Admmistiation is fairly chargeable, and I will
unite with him m condemning and correcting it
Till this shall be done, these general charges
amount to nothin 
Mr B said that m regard to theallowanceof pri-
vate claims, he was one of those who had subjected
himself to the chaige of llhbeiality for having
scrutinized them with too much severity As an
individual, he might be, and he trusted he was,
sufficiently liberal with his own money, but he did
not feel that he hada ugnt to giveaway that of the
people He was, therelore, piepared to unite with
the Senator in exposing and correcting every ex-
travagance in the administration of the Govern-
ment All he wanted was the ability to discover
this extravagance
To return to the subject, he did not think this
was a propitious moment to make any general and
Ã­adical change in oui land system, such as the
Senator proposed We Â«cere now approaching
the close of the last session of a long and stormy
Congress, and Us few remaining weeks could be
bettei, much better, employed than in discussing
the amendment, whichit was moialty certain could
not become a law before its termination The bill
proposed no change in the system, but merely that
of giving to actual settlers the right of purchasing,
in limited quantities, ata small reduction of price,
lands which had been refused by other purchasers
for periods of five and ten yeais, and to the resi-
dent owners of lands in the new States, the same
limited right of purchasing such vacant lands,
provided any such adjoined their present tracts
Whilst he should cheerfully vote for the bill, he
would vote with equal cheerfulness against the
Senator's amendment
GRADUATION BILI
REMARKS OF HON. W. S. FULTON,
OF ARKANSAS,
I  Sevate, January 9, 1839,
On the bill to reduce and graduate the price of the
Public Lands, the question bemg on the amend-
ment proposed by the Committee on the Public
Lands, granting the right of purchase at the re-
duced prices to owners of contiguous lands
Mr   FULTON observed that the discuss on
which the oill had undergone, had oeen a mat er
of great surprise to him, particularly as a gradua-
tion bill had passed this body at the last sessio -,
