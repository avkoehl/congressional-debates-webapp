ADJOURNMENT OYER.
Mr. MAYNARD. I move that when the House
adjourns to-morrow it adjourn to meet on Mon-
day next.
Mr, ETHERIDGE. I demand the yeas and
najs on that.
Mr. BRIGGS. I move to amend by striking
out " Monday" and inserting " Saturday."
Mr. CRAWFORD. I move that the House
do now adjourn.
The motion was not agreed to.
Mr. KUNKEL. I move to amend the amend-
ment so that when the House adjourns to-day, it
adjourn to meet on Saturday next.
Mr. HUGHES. I wish to call the attention
of the House to the fact that to-morrow has been
set apart for the transaction of business connected
with the District of Columbia. We were de-
prived of one of the two days assigned at last ses-
sion for the transaction of business of this District
by the announcement of the decease of a member
of Congress. We had therefore but one day for the
purpose, and in fact nothing was accomplished.
It is a matter of imperative necessity that some-
thing shall be done for the District of Columbia.
The District business has been made the special
order for to-morrow, and I trust there will be no
adjournment to interfere with it.
The question was taken on Mr. Kunkel's
amendment to the amendment; and it was not
agreed to.
The question recurred on Mr. BitfGGs's amend-
ment.
Mr. COLFAX. I rise to a point of order. I
do not think we have any right to decide to what
time wo shall adjourn to-morrow. If we can do
so for to-monow, we can decide to what time the
House shall odjouin a week after to-morrow.
Mr. HUGHES. The use of the Hall 1ms
already been assigned for Friday, and of course
the House cannot sit that dny.
The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks the point
of order comes too late.
The question was taken on Mr. Briggs's amend-
ment; and it was not agreed to.
The question recurred on Mr. Maynaud's mo-
tion, on which the yeas and nays had been de-
manded.

Mr. BARKSDALE. 1 would inquire whether,

Mr. BRIGGS said: Permit me to say that I am
in favor of the proposition of the gentleman from
Tndiana, [Mr. IIoi.mant;] but I am unwilling 1o
reach that proposition by overruling what 1 re-
gard to be the just decision of the Speaker of this
House.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Is debate in
order?
The SPEAKER. It is not.
Mr. BRIGGS. And I say that, rather than
submit to an attempt to coerce this side of the
House, [" order!" "order!"] by overruling the
decision of the Speaker, [" order!" " order!"] I
am willing to remain here [" order!"] twenty-four
hours or twenty-four months. [Shouts of "or-
der!" and great laughter and confusion.]
Mr. ETHERIDGE moved to dispense with
the reading of the names.
Mr. HOUSTON objected.
Air. HOWARD, of Michigan. I wish -to make
a proposition which I hope will meet the views
of both sides of the House. The House is now
thin, and it would be unfair to attempt to press a
vote in its present condition I then propose that
it shall be agreed that a vote be taken to-monow
at one o'clock, and that the House now adjourn.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. Take a vote upon
what ?
Mr. HOWARD, of Michigan. *Upon the ap-

The SPEAKER.' There is a special order
which will interfere.
Mr. MeCLERNAND. Otherwise it would
come up'
The SPEAKER, it would.
