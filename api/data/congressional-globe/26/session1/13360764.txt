APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Independent Tren&ury—Mr. White.
H. of Reps.
evidences from the hands of tl  highest officers of the party in
powei, the same party now not only vehemently oppose an
rmansion ol bank discounts, feut utterly repudiate the use of
the public i' posites, as a basis, lor discounts And tin* is not
all In the fa -e oi thtse notornus tacts, facts well known to
everv rtaamg man, we had it boldly asserted, in tlnsilebate, by
the honotab'e gentleman horn Massachusetts, (Mr Williams,)
likewise other gentlemen. thai the Administration were not re-
sponsible tor the excessive Isaacs ot bank paper The gentle
man Horn New \ors, Mr Vviderpoel, mikes the assertion,
that the Administration had <¡o agenty in causing the over
issue d the S i'e banks, butbroid'y alleges that the Unittd
S,ate Bank—the mo lster—was responsible What lamuua
ble ignorance, or what unpardonable turpitude '
In connei ion with this topi;, I must ask the indulgence of
the committee, nvln'-t I pul to rest another deputed point It
was asserted in debate, on ye terday, by tne honorable gentle
man from Massachusetts that the Administration was in no
v,\v nspmsib'e for the vast increase of hanks and bank
cap tal Not only so, sir, but that the Opposition had been the
cause of all this Unlounded in lact as the charge is, it his
to be reluted or it go*;, to the country, endorsed b\ an honoia
blemeiiberot Congress, with the confirmation, diawn from
silence, tint the assertion was tiue beyond a dispute. Should it
remain unnoticed and unanswered, reckles  as eveiy one
knowsit tobe, who is acquainted with the facts, yet it will
mislead many Now for the facts and fisures upon this point
I will t ike the years 183">—6, which are «elected, because dur
1115 tho^e years, a greater amount of the bank capital was
created, than any two years within the period constituting the
bank mania

sir, in h s own emphatic language, I e s lys, in his annual mes
sage of 1837, speaking of the Sub'lieatury, recommending its
passage again to the favorable consideration of Congress- "I
have found no reason to change my own opinion "Not only so
not content with a scornful disregard of ihe will of the people'

favorite scheme, and to couit some of his dissenting ¿members

ling, he unblushirgly chRiges the people with bribery, boueht
up by bank ufluence, and this libel upon the virtue of the
Ameiican people, endorsed by the highest officer of the nation
has gone foi th to the f >ur quarters of the world as evidence
oftheconuption of a tree Government What a fulfilmentol
the declaiation "that the will of the people, under no plausi-
ble pietences whatever, is to be disregarded," what "a faithful
obedience upon the pait of the public servant" to the decision
of the maionty of the people But this is not all. The Presi.
dent, in his annual message of 1837, renews Ins recommenda-
tion of the Sub Treasury, but with very great modifications.
Perceiving that he had overestimated the eullibility cf the peo-
ple in his financial plan of I8J7, he qualifies it materially mhw
annual messairi> he omits the specie clause, the most funda-
mental half ol the measure, he omits the bankiupt measuie.
another most essential feature of the system, and in order to
make it stnl mote palatable to I is fi lends in this House, he re-
cimmends that the plan might very well cmbiace tbe use of
State banks as depositaries, to be used at the "voluntary" and
' discretionary ' will of the Executive, whenevei lie might deem
it ' advisable" or "profitable," a legal connection of the Go-
vernment and banks, an idea nota y longer to be entertained in
theiulgment of the President, a loose "vole tary, discretion-
al y," unlawful, undefined, umestrained, adulterous connection,
might be 'desirable" and "profitable" In conclusion, upon
this topie in that message, he sa>s "I recommend the whole
matter to vour dispassionate reflection " The measure is taken
up in the Smute, passes—omitting tin specie clause—curies to
this House, the populai body of Congics , members all fresh
fn m their constituents heie it was indignantly laid on theta-
bl , a movement esteemed in parliamentary courtesy contemp-
tuous—a contempt justly due an Executive measure from the
immediate representatives of the people, under all the circun-
stances Cue would have supposed tl at "a public servant,"
aeknowledgu g "ihe rightful supiemacy of the op nions and
wishes of'he people," would have sid nutted to these repeated
decision", and sulli red the pio ct to hive h re slept the sletp

this no test He appeals from the second decision of the popu-
lar branch of Congress again to the people 'Ihe issue is fan y
made up—a 1 the candidates fot olhce, '"ate an 1 National, take
it up and discuss it—eveiy piess argi es and discusses 11—it is
made emphatically the question of paity orthodoxy—every
fnend of the \ 'm nistration who refused to give in his suppoit
at the sacrifice of judgment and of ce. science, was read out of
the church, and bianded by eveiy iiithli ss press of the party,
from theofienl e-igan to tbe v llage thumb ( aper as a "deserter

these unequivocal evidences before him ol popular displcasuie

says, at the opening of the next session of Congress, in his an-
nual message, ' my opinion as to the sifekeepmg and disburse

Lord 1S10, wnh no evidence ol any abatement of popular hosti-
lity to the measure, our President this high pneetof Democra-
cy, in his anninl message, recommends and pi esses upon Con-
gress the cons 'pration ami adoption of th1" scheme, in its most
odious shepe, with all l's anpuitemnt measures—Treasury
no'es, Trcisiirv drafts, discretional y powers to issue Govern-
ment paper to meet fluctuations and unexpected deficiencies,
not omitting the bankrupt measure, and in despite of the popu-
tar will, in despite of lamentation here or elsevvheie, is doomed
to become the law of the land, under circumstances that will
stamp the law and iu> authors with a maik of infamy a  lasting
as the rock of azes carried by the votes of membeis oceupjing
seats upon thn fi >or, at thesaenfice of the elective franchise, in
opcndestcration of the Constitution ol the Estate they misrepie-
sent, as well as the Constitution of the United States, and by the
aid of other members, cnuited into compliance by the allure-
ments of ofiee, 01 driven into support by the terrors of ruthless
proscription
Mr Chin mm I cannot omit to notice, in com ection with this
branch of the subject, a rcrraikab'e 1 as-a^e 11 ihe speci il mes-
sigeof 1^37 It ísinthese word 'It a Chiel Minístrate may
be aPowed to speak for himself on such a pom , I cm truly say
that to me noilin g would be mne tiu y accep able than the
withdrawal from the Executive, to the eiea tstpiacucal extent,

venue " What a beautiful il'ustiatu 11 ol P e smcciiiy of this
sentiment, is contaired in the facts I hive just laid before the

from the formation of the Government, lias considered a Suo-
Trc'-uiv even propei, much less as indispensably recessary, to
enable the I'xtcutiveto di ehaige its duties to the Corstitution
and the rom ly, in the custody and d'.sbur ement ol the public
revenues?" Pit sir, it would seen nothing would be more
painful tot'ie Chief Magistrate, than the nccei-sity  f exercising
any unnecessary Executive power—that nothing would be
more asrreeable "than the withdrawal of all concern in the cus-
tody and disbursement of the public rev ernes " History, Mr.
Chairman, is full of examples like tins—examples of this same
reluctant assumption of power havp displayed themselves in all
ages, and all countries—111 monarchies, in despotisms, in lepub-
lies, 111 ancient as w ell as modern times.   Casar croised the for-
