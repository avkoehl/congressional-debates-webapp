MEMPHIS, November 30, 1863. (Received December 2.)

Major-General SHERMAN,

Through Major-General Grant:

Roddey is on Bear Creek, Lee near Okolona, fronted by our cavalry; Forrest and Richardson are near New Albany. They mean to attack Corinth in force, but have stopped in their march. I have a strong force at La Grange, with orders to move to Corinth if an attack is made there. Their activity has compelled me to abandon the work of taking up iron and be ready for a fight. Their forces, if united, will be about 6,000, unless they bring infantry by railroad from below, which I do not expect. Scouts just in from Rome report that Bragg has been moving ordnance and incumbrances back for two weeks. No further news.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Corinth:

I have dispatch from Sherman of the 26th. We have driven Bragg from Mission Ridge and are in pursuit. Try and find out if any movement of infantry from below is going on by rail. I have no apprehension of their mounted men, but if Johnston moves up force it may be serious and need be watched closely.

Brig. General J. M. TUTTLE,

La Grange:

Mizner is still near and in front of Ripley. Forrest and Richardson are not dangerous. Their aim is to get into West Tennessee. Lee is the dangerous man. All that we can do is to hold our forces ready to concentrate on any point threatened in force. If a column in froce threatens Corinth, you must re-enforce promptly. Morgan's force is enough for La Grange in case the main attack is on Corinth, and from La Grange he can cover Moscow. Send out and destroy Ammen's bridge, over Wolf, between Moscow and La Grange.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

(Same to General Stevenson, Corinth.)

LA GRANGE, November 30, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Nothing new that is reliable. I have a rumor that seems from reliable source, that General Joe Johnston moved up to Oxford by rail with Loring's division (infantry) from Canton, French's division (infantry) from Meridian, and Jackson's division of cavalry marched up also from vicinity of Canton, and that they were all at Oxford before last, expecting to march yesterday toward Okolona
