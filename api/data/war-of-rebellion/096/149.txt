HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,January 16, 1865-5 p.m.

Brevet Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

The following report from General Mott received. I suppose I may send out and gather the corn:
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, SECOND ARMY CORPS,January 16, 1865-2.30 p.m.

Major S. CARNCROSS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Army Corps:

MAJOR: The party I sent out has returned. They advanced through the woods, found where the foraging party had rendezvoused, but report that they had all left. As I suspected, it was a party to get the corn in front of the Wyatt house. As there is some left yet, I have the honor to apply for permission to send a party and gather it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. MOTT,

Brevet Major-General.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,January 16, 1865-5 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Send out for the corn, and gobble up some rebels, too, if you can.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,January 16, 1865-5.30 p.m.

Brevet Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

I send three reports. I think the report of the signal officer is most likely to be correct.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
