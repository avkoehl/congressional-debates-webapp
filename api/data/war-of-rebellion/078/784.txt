General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

Following just received from A. Batlin, Clinton, La., dated to-day:

Dispatch from General Taylor (18th) states that the contemplated movement impracticable. Operations are suspended until further instructions from Richmond.

May I not use Roddey's command as circumstances may indicate? North MISSISSIPPI and Mobile require troops immediately.

General BRAGG:

Re-enforcements reported going to enemy's army in Mobile Bay. His army near Holly Springs quiescent. Forrest in its rear to-night. Crossing to take place to-night. Very few soldiers in Mobile - many women and children. Ordnance supply very short.

MERIDIAN, MISS., August 20, 1864.

His Excellency CHARLES CLARK,

Macon, Miss:

MY DEAR SIR: I arrive here this morning. The arms intended for you were sent to Forrest on the 17th. Captain Evans explained the facts to Mr. Browne, Colonel Stewart's clerk. There are now here and at Demopolis enough arms to meet the call in your telegram just received (2,000). The supply of ammunition at hand is very small, but I am convinced that it will be properly increased in full time. Forrest's ordnance officer reports 100 rounds on hand for all Enfield rifles with Forrest. This can be divided out to all Enfield rifles you may immediately send (with your troops) to Forrest. there are enough of small-arms to furnish all the troops yet reported in this State and Alabama. The supply of ammunition is insufficient at this time, but, by manufacture and importation from other departments, I am assured this want will be filled in time. If I can see you personally I will be able to explain to you better than by letter the very embarrassing calls which are now being made upon me to guard other points of the department. I will content myself with assuring you that Mobile is more immediately pressed than any other important point. There is good reason to believe that troops are being sent from the army near Holly Springs to re- enforce Canby's
