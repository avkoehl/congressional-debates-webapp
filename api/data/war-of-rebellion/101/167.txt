Numbers 1. Report of Colonel James J. Byrne, Eighteenth New York Cavalry, commanding District of Bonnet Carre. HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT BONNET CARRE, Bonnet Carre, La., April 7, 1865.

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to respectfully transmit the report of Major Burt, Third Rhode Island Cavalry, who was sent by Lieutenant-Colonel Parkhurst, in obedience to instructions from me, to the French Settlement, for the purpose of capturing a party of guerrillas or scouts, who made that place their headquarters. So far I have been unable to capture the officer or leaders of this party. The troops in the district are now so disposed that it is almost impossible for any raiding party that attempts to come within the lines to escape, all bayous and canals being strongly picketed and in direct communication with this post.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES J. BYRNE,

Colonel, Commanding District.
