Captain Eyster's family is safe, but saved nothing but the clothes they had on. Gross barbarities were practiced by the rebels. Lowest estimate of loss is $1,500,000. A public meeting of citizens was held in afternoon, and Rev. John R. Warner appointed to go to the Northern cities and make an appeal in behalf of the suffering people. Will send out other scouts.
