EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Atlanta, Ga., September 19, 1864.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT, City Point, Va.:

GENERAL: Your messenger has not yet arrived. Things remain statu quo. Most of the inhabitants are gone, and I am exchanging 2,000 prisoners with Hood on a special exchange, with the understanding that I get an equal number of my own men back whom I can put right away to duty. He raised the question of humanity, but I am not to be moved by such tricks of the enemy. I have taken high ground with Hood on purpose. A deserter just in says Stewart's corps is moving back to Macon with a view of going to Virginia. I have ordered one of my female scouts+ from New Orleans to Augusta, and will send some out from here and give you prompt notice of any of Hood's army going East. I can quickly bounce him out of Lovejoy's, but think him better there where I can watch him that farther off. I await the arrival of your messenger with impatience. All well, but large numbers of our men and officers are being discharged-time out-and we must have recruits.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
