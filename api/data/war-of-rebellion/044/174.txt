HARPER'S FERRY,

June 13, 1863-11 p. m.

Lieutenant Colonel DONN PIATT:

I explained to you in my last telegram why I did not order the Fifteenth Virginia to Martinsburg. Shall I now do so . The telegraph line ceased to work to Winchester at about 9 o'clock, so Colonel Smith reports. All quiet in this neighborhood yet .

B. F. KELLEY

, Brigadier-General .

(We have not worked with Winchester since about 9 o'clock . - OPERATOR.)
HEADQUARTERS, Baltimore, June 14, 1863.

Brigadier-General KELLEY, Harper's Ferry:

Tyler informs the general commanding that at nightfall he will fall back to Williamsport, and from thence to Harper's Ferry. It is important Milroy should know this . Send trusty scout with it in cipher, if possible. By order:

DONN PIATT,Chief of Staff .

- MARTINSBURG, June 14, 1863-3 p. m.

Major-General SCHENCK and President LINCOLN:

General Milroy is in a tight place . If he gets out, it will be by good luck and hard fighting . Not a strangler from his army is yet in ; it is neck or nothing . We are besieged here ; have had a little skirmish . I imagine our rebel friends are waiting for grub and artillery.

DAN. TYLER,

Brigadier-General . -
HDQRS. MIDDLE DEPARTMENT, EIGHT ARMY CORPS, Baltimore, June 14, 1863. ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the Unites States, Washington, D. C.:

I am doing all I can to get Milroy back toward Harper's Ferry on the railroad . He sent down a courier in the night to say that, if he could not fall back, he could sustain himself, and hold his position five days, but I have no force to support him . The rebels appear to have pushed on beyond him rapidly and impetuously, and are reported approaching Martinsburg .

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,Major-General, Commanding . -

U. S. MILITARY TELEGRAPH HEADQUARTERS, 12 p. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel PIATT:

Harper's Ferry reports slight current from Winchester battery, which proves the wire is not broken . It is probably on the ground . Cannot work to Winchester at present. Respectfully, &amp;c.,

G. W. BALDWIN.
