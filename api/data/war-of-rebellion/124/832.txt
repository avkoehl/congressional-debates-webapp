Governor MORTON,

Indianapolis, Ind:

The matter presented in your telegram of making the first payment of bounty $100 has been carefully considered, and the Secretary does not consider that it would be best at this to change the plan adopted and sent forth.

JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.

INDIANAPOLIS, September 22, 1863.

Colonel FRY:

O. P. MORTON,

Governor.
