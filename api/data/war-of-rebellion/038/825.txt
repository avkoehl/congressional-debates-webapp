HEADQUARTERS STEVENSON'S DIVISION, near Hankinson's Ferry, May 3, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel J. THOMPSON,Asst. Insp. General, DEPT. MISS. and E. La., Vicksburg:

COLONEL: The immense wagon train and all the troops were safely crossed to-day on our boat-bridge, and are now encamped in the vicinity of Hankinson's Ferry.

I received information this evening that a lot of beef-cattle were on the other side of the river, and I immediately sent to the officer in command of the rear-guard, inquiring whether there would be time to secure them. It was just too lat. I am not in command here, and have no authority to halt the troops, and it would have taken too long to communicate with General Loring. General Loring has sent two of my brigades to-night to Big Black Bridge. You directed me to-day to return as soon as I thought the safety of this flank justified it. I have reported to General Loring. Shall I say to him that you wish me to return?

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. L. STEVENSON,

Major-General, Commanding.

Vicksburg, May 3, 1863.

Colonel STOCKTON, Jackson Arsenal:
