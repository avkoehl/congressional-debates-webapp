General Hancock was attacked six times by the enemy and repulsed them five times, with heavy loss to them and light on our part. In the sixth attack they broke through Barlow's division, and captured several guns. The balance of Hancock's line held its position until evening, when it is said both parties retired. The Fifth Corps was not engaged, but holds its old position, Second in rear of Fifth.
