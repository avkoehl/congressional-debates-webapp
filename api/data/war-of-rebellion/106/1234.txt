Colonel R. C. DRUM,

Asst. Adjt. General, Headquarters Department of the Pacific:

COLONEL: I have the honor to inclose herewith a communication from the Honorable C. C. Bush, county judge of Shasta County, with petition of citizens of Shasta and Tehama Counties for a military force to be sent there for protection against the Indians. * Black Rock, on Mill Creek, is the point at which the petitioners ask that the troops may be stationed, but it appears to me that Fort Reading is a more central position, as the Indians committing these depredations operate extensively on the Cow Creek, Battle Creek, Clover Creek, and Oak Run, all in the neighborhood of Fort Reading, at which place we have quarters and a fine stable. I was stationed there three years, and we had then but little difficulty with the Indians. If the general approves I can send a company of cavalry from Camp Union at once to the point he may decide on.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Honorable C. C. BUSH,

County Judge of Shasta County, California:

SIR: I have received your letter of the 6th instant addressed to Major-General McDowell with petition of the citizens of Shasta and Tehama Counties for military protection against the Indians in that region. I have forwarded these papers to General McDowell recommending that a company of cavalry be sent up from Camp Union. Anasmuch as these Indians appear to operate extensively on the Cow Creek, Battle Creek, Clover Creek, and Oak Run, it appears to me that Fort Reading would be a more central point to make the depot.

With great respect, your obedient, servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
