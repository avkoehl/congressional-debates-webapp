first Massachusetts while waving defiantly his traitors flag. The enemy had from six to ten pieces of artillery and from 1,800 to 2,000 men. We approached to within 30 miles of Norfolk, and undoubtedly the defeat of one of their best regiments, the Third Georgia, produced considerable panic at Norfolk.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. L. RENO,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Captain LEWIS RICHMOND, Assistant Adjutant-General.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPT. OF NORTH CAROLINA, Numbers 30. April 26, 1862.

The general commanding desires to express his high appreciation of the excellent conduct of the forces under command of Brigadier-General Reno in the late demonstration upon Norfolk. He congratulates them as well upon the manly fortitude with which they endured excessive heat and extraordinary fatigue on a forced march of 40 miles in twenty-four hours as upon the indomitable courage with which, notwithstanding their exhaustion, they attacked a large body of the enemy's best artillery, infantry, and cavalry in their own chosen position, achieving a complete victory. It is therefore ordered, as a deserved tribute to the perseverance, discipline, and bravery exhibited by the officers and soldiers of the Twenty-first Massachusetts, Fifty-first Pennsylvania, Ninth New York, Eighty-ninth New York, and Sixth New Hampshire, on the 19th of April - a day already memorable in the history of our country - that the above regiments inscribe upon their respective colors the name, "Camden, April 19."

The general commanding desires to express his approbation of general Reno's strict observance of orders when the temptation to follow the retreating enemy was so great.

By command of Major General A. E. Burnside:

LEWIS RICHMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
