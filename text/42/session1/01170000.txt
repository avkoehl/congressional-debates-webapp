The VICE PRESIDENT. The time fixed

whose credentials are on file, who will please
present themselves as their names are called
at the chair of the Vice President to take the

The list was read as follows :

Hon. Henry Cooper, of Tennessee.
Hon. Alexander Caldwell, of Kansas.
Hon. Aaron H. Cragin, of New Hampshire.
Hon. Thomas W. Ferry, of Michigan.

Hon. George G. Wright, of Iowa.
As their names were called, the Senators
named (with the exception of Mr. Saulsbtjry,
who was not present) came forward, and the
oaths prescribed by law were administered to
them, and they took their seats.
SENATOR PROM ALABAMA.
The name of George Goldthwaite, of Ala-
bama, was called in order in the above list,
when,
Mr. SHERMAN. Before the oath is ad-
ministered to Hon. George Goldthwaite as
Senator from Alabama, 1 desire to present
the memorial of forty five members of jthe sen-
ate and house of representatives of the Legis-
lature of the State of Alabama, containing state
ments of fact which, if true, would not justify
the taking of the oath of office at this time.
I ask that the memorial be read, and that the
credentials, with the memorial, lie on the table
for the present until the Judiciary Committee
is formed, with a view to their reference there.
Until that is done, I object to the oath being
administered.
Mr. DAVIS, of Kentucky. Mr. Presi-
dent—■—
The VICE PRESIDENT. Will the Senator
from Kentucky suspend to allow other Sena-
tors elect to be sworn to whose qualification
there is no objection 1
Mr. DAVIS, of Kentucky. I want it under-
stood, though, that so soon as the uncontested
seats of Senators who present themselves for
qualification are disposed of, the question of
the right of the Senator from Alabama to take
his seat will then be before the Senate.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will
submit it at that time to the Senate.
CONTESTED CASES.
The calling of the list as given above hav-
ing been concluded, and the Senators named
sworn in,
The VICE PRESIDENT. The case of
Mr. Goldthwaite, Senator-elect from Alabama,
is now before the Senate, and the protest pre-
sented by the Senator from Ohio will be read.
The Chair will state at this time that there are
two credentials from the State of Texas; one
certifying the election of Morgan C. Hamilton,
and the other certifying the election of J. J.
Reynolds. There is also a certificate of the
election of Foster Blodgett as Senator from
the State of Georgia, whose name has not yet
been called. The Chair understands that there
is also a certificate of election of Zebulon B.
Vance as Senator from the State of. North
Carolina.
Mr. SHERMAN. We had better act on the
cases separately.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It was obvious
that the cases just stated would probably in-
volve some debate and hence those names were
not called. The case of Mr. Goldthwaite ia
now reached, upon which the Senator from
Kentucky [Mr. Dayis] is entitled to the floor ;
but the Secretary will first read the protest pre-
sented by the Senator from Ohio.
SENATOR FKOM ALABAMA.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I suggest that the cre-
dentials be first read.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The credentials
will be lead. They were read to the Senate
during the last Congress.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Attention was not paid
to them then. I should like to know the form
of the credentials.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The credentials
will be read.
The Secretary read as follows :
State of Alabama.
To the President of the Senate of the United States:
1, Robert B. Lindsay, Governor of the State of
Alabama, do hereby certify that in conformity to the

The subscribers, members of the senate and house
of representatives of the State of Alabama, respect-
fully represent:
