Commanding First Brigade:

HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,September 29, 1863-3.30 a.m.

Major General P. H. SHERIDAN:

GENERAL: Our pickets in front of General Davis' line report that the enemy are very busy at some kind of work, across the creek, but very close upon them. They are digging, carrying rails, &amp;c., and are supposed to be either building a bridge, constructing a battery, or some kind of intrenchments.

General McCook wishes your advance lines to be cautioned to be on the alert. He also desires you to have the manner in which you propose to withdraw your advance lines clearly understood, at all lines, by the troops composing your entire line.

Very respectfully,

G. P. THRUSTON.

A. A. G. and Chief of Staff, Twentieth Army Corps:

COLONEL: Colonel Laiboldt reports from the picket that the enemy have erected breastworks on the point of Lookout Mountain and are taking up artillery this morning.

I have the honor to be, colonel, your obedient servant,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Chattanooga, September 29, 1863.

Captain P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: The officer on watch in the fort in my line of defenses reports no material change in the appearance of the enemy in my front except an apparent diminution of camp-fires last night, but it would not be safe to deduce any positive conclusion from this appearance, as last night was excessively hazy, almost obscuring all vision.
