ORD'S HEADQUARTERS,

March 31, 1865. (Received 10.35 a.m.)

The cannonading is, I think, to shell our working parties. The musketry is, I think, from our own men mostly.

General GRANT:

The following from the front, date 10.20 a.m.:

Sharp firing still going on in front of Foster. Foster is in center to left. The firing is going off toward our right. General Turner has pushed his skirmishers forward. A number of prisoners are coming in.

GIBBON.

I am in communication with Wright, who holds a division ready. I think my new line strong enough to be held.

Turner has pushed two brigades forward till his pickets are in sight of enemy's main line. General Humphreys should connect with him. It weakens Turner to go far up Hatcher's Run. Enemy re-enforced in my front last night. One hundred and forty-two prisoners in.
