JACKSON, July 31, 1862.

Colonel BRYANT, Humboldt:

I have not heard from cavalry to-day, though am sure they are moving down the Hatchie, supported by infantry. I have to-night re-enforced the burnt bridge. I do not think there are that many of Falkner's command. If you can send a force against them do so.

JOHN A. LOGAN,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. FIFTH DIVISION, ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE, Memphis, Tenn., July 31, 1862.

General I. F. QUINBY,Commanding, Columbus, Ky.:

SIR: I received yours, inclosing dispatches from General Grant, and would be obliged if you would telegraph him the contents of the within letter* and then send it to him by mail.

Colonel Grierson, Sixth Illinois Cavalry, who commanded the scout yesterday to Colliersville, learned that a brigade of the enemy had moved up to within 7 miles of Bolivar and then backed out. There has been a rumor that Bolivar had been attacked, but I do not believe it; it is more probable the bulk of the forces have gone toward Chattanooga and Nashville.

Curtis is preparing to move on Little Rock. He is still at Helena.

I hear the fleet has raised the siege of Vicksburg.

I am fortifying here below Memphis, but dispose my troops to cover the town.

Yours, truly,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, July 31, 1862.

Major-General GRANT, Corinth, Miss.:

Cannot you move on the flank and rear of the rebels on the Hatchie and cut them off? At any rate drive them out of West Tennessee and carefully guard the railroad from Columbus to Decatur.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, July 31, 1862.

Major-General GRANT, Corinth, Miss.:

You must judge for yourself the best use to be made of your troops. Be careful not to scatter them too much; also to hold them in readiness to re-enforce Buell at Chattanooga, if necessary.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
