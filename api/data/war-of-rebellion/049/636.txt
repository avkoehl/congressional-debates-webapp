to appeal to your excellency for aid, and to ask you as Governor of North Carolina to call on the patriotic citizens in the neighboring counties, and elsewhere, to sent a portion of their hands, say onefifth of the negroes (male), to the city of Wilmington, to be employed under the command of General Whiting, on the fortifications. What we do for the safety of your principal sea-port should be done quickly, and if possible before our bitter foes meet with further successes at Charleston or elsewhere. Should any military organization be required for the collection of the requisite number of negroes, at least 1,000, General Whiting can furnish the force. He will be directed to confer with you on this point.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. GILMER,

Colonel of Engineers, and Chief of Bureau.
