CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
(Mr. Wise) objected to it yesterday, when the no-
tice was given, and he repeated his objection to-
day; and'he supposed ibe question would be en
the reception of the resolution. ''Shall it be re-
ceived?'- was the question; and he extended :hat
this required a majority of twolhircU.
A member was heard to observe that the ques-
tion was cn the adoption of the resolution.
Mr. WISE. I contend that it is not received.
The SPEAKER, made some observations, which
v?ere veiy indistinctly heard; but he was under-
stood to s-*y that the resolution came property be-
fore -he House, ons day's noticc having been given
by the gentleman from Massachusetts, >e=?:et('ay,
as th« rules prescribed. Bat he further observed
that the committees were net appointed; and, there-
fore, it petitions were called for from the i.fcveial
States, th*y could not be referred.
Mr. WtSE?aid ha would Mis;sjo5.r to iheSpf^ker
that the i.on appo.ntment of \h: mere members: of
the committees was no reason vtiiy the Slates
should not b called for p<rittu-j>; for, if the mem-
bers were not appointed, the commutces were.
The rules provided that there ^h'-uld be certain
s'anding cosnmiUfeir; and alt a gentleman had to
do, on presenting a petition, was to move ih&titbe
referred to a commi'tee, and not to A, B*C, and
D, cons ituting the committee. The committee -,
then, wer^ m ens:ence, though th'* vnt mhrrs '.vere
not all there uho *^erc to he n^rped r n ihoie com-
mi'tees; and they could lc'er petitions m day, nhf n
the members were not named by the b'p^akfr, as
well as io-motrov, or a future dny, when they
should be nanud.

DEATH OP THE HON. J. W. WILLIAViS.
Mr. JOHN T. MASON rose to announce ih~
deaih of ihe Hun. J. W. Williams ol Maryland,
and spoke as f&iiowt:

neigi-Lots and friends received die- sad iiifelbgorrR
of bis death, the undivided voice With which his
m:.ny v r'ues are ac.i.'nowkt'ffed by Ihofe wi h

have been m paa'.i.-, bfe--now sour year.—"hith-

ent financial enibarras-iuef-ts;—made long before
any one else h-d lee ..;ivdotn !o foresee them--are
all-abund?rit e< idences of the uu'h of what I havr
said. On oecasiorss like 'he-se, ii is no unu-ual, I
am av'-'&re, lo pa^j hi b ereo'nienis u( on the ehsr-
aett r of the d, ceased—a tno'e of prtceed'ng the
1---S rrquisite in the presort mstaace, ss the charac-
ter of Sir. WiLMiMs was too v.'e'l fstablifhrd, and
h'id ,n too high estfetii, to h .V:* asythirg lo iiooe
fror.i prais-., or i'-rr f:oi;i c.t.s'jic. His mil"! and
geiole ■ pir.t reacf:ed it ne.irly unco.isibl® for him
to have any enemies. The innoccnce and simpli-
city of hi': behavior, the sensibility of h's heart, the
fidelity with which he discharged the duties of life,
the equaniaiiiy with which he bore its rebukes
and sufferings-', will leave a lasting impression on
the minds of hia friends and acquaintances.
We have just met to enter upon a new session;
and the first thing almost that claims our attention—
coming, as •' ' -ore, as a message from the Exeetl*
tive on high, ii.tiiropting the salutations of friends,
marring the pleasure of the occasion, and checking
the ardor of our hopes—is another example, in the
death of our friend, of the uncertainty of human
life. It could not have come on a mere fit occa-
sion. We have enteied upon a new port'on of
time, aod such occasions are pec jlv.rly favorable
to morai reflection. On an entrance on a new
scene, or a new period in our life, a contemplative
mind v.'.!! be naturally employed in ertimating its
acquisitions, conparing its improvements, retra-
t'lfij? ra?t oocuriencec, and revolving futute pros-
pects.' Ths example of the decta.ed is not only
before you for such a v.holesotne exercise of the
mind; but to it may be added his voice, which may
now be considered "as addiessihg^ you from the
tomb, ana enjoining upon you the duty of prepara-
tion lor another life. What an example of mor-
taliiy is presented on the present occasion! With-
out the slightest warning, without the opportunity
of a moment's immed a'e preptration, away from
home, and alone, the destroyer methmi—no tender
afsidntties of friendship, no vell-known voice, no
wife- nor son, n«r dangnter was nssr to soothe his
sorrows or cle'-'e his eyes in t:eath. May this
solemn event have a wide spread influence. Ia-
stepc! ot murmunnfi at such gffl.ctive dicpensations
which sepr-rate us irom th"fe we love and esteem,
let employ ihem as motives to set our affections
upon the nr.ore lasiitig things of ano'her world—
remcmberiJig'.b.;t, v-1iat< vj; ties of affection are
bioken by dea'.h, w'nic-ver pleasure; ?,ie lest to us
here, are only tak'.n from the enjoyvnen'i of time,
to be added to -hose of eternity.
Mr. Williams wi' a native of Maryland, and
was aged about fifty fire y-is«. He wis formany
yei's it DroKSiiieiit tacmber of the Legishture of
hi.; State, 9id wps at one tiir.e Speaker of the
House of Delegates. Durirg the whole time he
was a nember, ha opposed with fmnne.'s and un-
abatirg z al that system ot iniernal improvements
which has tveitu-ited in overwhelming the Slate
in endle. s taxation. Totfe who are now lament-
ing over what they regard the evl-s which that
policy hj.s brought upon th'.m, will cherish in high
respect his ragarity iu predicting those evils, and
ihe pertinacity .villi which he re i.-ted ihe system
which has en'a;":ed them on us, Ttiose who still
believe the pohcy to have been a wise one, mast
do him the justice to admit that his opposition to it
was as homst as it was unyie'diog. In May,
1841, Mr. Williams was tlected to Conareis, and
continued a member rf this body up to the time of
his d( alb Here, as he was in the Legislature of
his S ate, he wis vig'Unt and ir-gular in his at-
tendance u[on his public du.ies.
In h:;n ilie State of R'aryland has lost a faithful
puj 10 servant; hi-,- famdy a devoted aail affec-
tionate head; and h;s friends one who was always
rea-'y to make any sacrifice to advance their in-
terests.
la conclusion, Mr. Mason offered the follow-
ing re'olutioss, which were un- nitnous'y sdopted:
Tnat dm House Inu'o leurneil, v*ith feelings of
(fec f> s"n.dUi!i;y. the iiiiciJigence cfihc deceasaof the honoTable
.Tames W. Williams, late a member of tins t'ongrfMP; and as
an evidence ci th^ s-ympathy wliKh die members euteriam ami
liprcby tendei to his surviving lelauves and ppjoOiial fliends,
Oiey will wetir ciape cn the lc.it urm foi thnty davs.
/iesoi'cei'?, a?o&, (a" a iurther maik of resptvt for the meni«
n-y of the deceaseJ,) that this House do row adjourn.
Ord'u-cd, That the Cieik communicate to the Senate infor-
mation of tlit. death of James W. Wili-jams, and of the pro«
:eediii2S ofthis House thereon.
The Hotise then adjsurr.ed.
[We omitted to s'„-Je, in onr report of yester-
day \> pneffdiBs;', that the lit ti. Robfiit C. Win-
TBROr, a Rcpre-enia-ivc fleet from the Slate cf
Massache-et:«, to supply the vacancy occasioned
by the resignation of the Hon. Nathan Appleton,
apppared, was qualified, and took his seat.]
