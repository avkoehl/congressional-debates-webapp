HDQRS. BOARD OF ENROLLMENT THIRD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF MISSOURI,Irionton, July 15, 1863.

Colonel E. B. ALEXANDER,

Actg. Asst. Prov. March General for Mo., Saint Louis, Mo.:

SIR: I have the honor to represent to you that there are several counties in this district in such a condition that in my judgment renders it useless to point a deputy provost-marshal for each one.

A considerable military force would force be required to enable them to do anything, but in many instances one deputy will answer for two or three counties. Under the circumstances am I authorized to appoint in this way, or must I appoint one for each county?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. W. NOELL,

Captain and Provost-Marshal, Third District of Missouri.

[Indorsement.]
HDQRS. ACTG. ASST. PROV. March General FOR MISSOURI,Saint Louis, July 16, 1863.

Respectfully forwarded to the Provost-Marshal-General, together with copy of my reply to the same inclosed herewith.

E. B. ALEXANDER,

Colonel, U. S. Army, and Actg. Asst. Prov. March General for Mo.

Saint Louis, July 16, 1863.

Captain C. W. NEOLL,

Provost-Marshal, Third District, Ironton, Mo.:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 15th instant, and in reply have to say that, upon a careful reading of Circular Numbers 19 and paragraph 11 of the Regulations, I am of the opinion that you have no discretion given you as to the number of deputy provost-marshal in your district, but are require to appoint one for each country, the object evidently being to secure the completion of the enrollment at as early a date as practicable.

I have, however, referred the question together with your letter to the Provost-Marshal-General and will advise you of his division.
