Major-General THOMAS, Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Wilson is trying to push in toward the Granny White pike, about a mile south of my right. My skirmishers on the right are supporting him. The skirmishing is pretty heavy. I have not attempted to advance my main line to-day, and do not think I am strong enough to do so. Will you be on this part of the line soon?

Very respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO, December 16, 1864-7.45 p. m.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS,Commanding Department of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report four pieces of artillery and a considerable number of prisoners captured by General Cox's division this afternoon. General Cox also reported four other pieces and caissons captured in the valley between the hill carried by General McArthur and that taken by General Cox. I learned, however, upon inquiry, that General McArthur's troops claimed, and, I have no doubt, justly, the honor of capturing the last four. My provost-marshal reports seventy-four prisoners captured this p. m. I have conversed with some of the officers captured, and am satisfied Hood's army is more thoroughly beaten than any troops I have ever seen. I congratulate you most heartily upon the result of the two days' operations. My messenger will wait for any orders you may have to send me.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
