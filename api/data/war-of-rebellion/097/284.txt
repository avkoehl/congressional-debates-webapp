GRANT'S HEADQUARTERS,

March 30, 1865 - 7 p. m. (received 10.30 o. m.)

General MEADE:

Would not the trains be in a better position and nearer the troops if they were west of the Vaughan road and between here and Hatcher's Run than where they are? Do you know of any troops between where my headquarters are and Stony Creek Station? I have but about forty men at headquarters and half of them are orderlies. I have just been thinking it a limited protection if the enemy should have any enterprising scouts about.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 30, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

This dispatch just received. Wire hard to work over:

A portion of Wilcox's division made a demonstration against Griffing about twenty minutes and were driven back into their lines. We took a few prisoners - broken-down men lately forced into the service. They don't know much, but think Johnson's division moved to their right when they came down this morning. General Heth is here, but they don't think his division is. They think Heth commands the corps, and Hill all the defenses south of the James.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

Geo. G. MEADE.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 30, 1865 - 7.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I send dispatch just received from Warren.* Line working badly I think his suggestion the best thing we can do under existing circumstances - that is, let Humphreys relieve Griffin, and let Warren move on to the White Oak road and endeavor to turn enemy's right. As I understand Warren, Ayres is now between S. and W. Dabney's, liable to be isolated. He must either be supported or withdrawn. By adopting the proposed plan he will be supported by the whole of the Fifth Corps, and they ought to overcome any opposition the enemy can make, except from strong entrenchments.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 30, 1865 - 8.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I send dispatch from Parke.+ Wright also reports no change visible in his front. I should like to know at the earliest moment whether they are to attack to-morrow. I also would like to have as much time as possible to-night for Humphreys to relieve Griffin, in case this is decided on. Parke reports his casualties in the affair of pickets last night as 9 killed, 40 wounded, 2 missing.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
