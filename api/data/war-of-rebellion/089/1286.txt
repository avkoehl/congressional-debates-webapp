Commanding, Petersburg:

I would suggest that your order General Whiting, if you have not already done so, to hold his position as long as he has a man. If his guns are knocked down, to hold on with his infantry and field batteries. I fancy that troops in forts place all of their reliance upon their heavy guns, hence their despondency and disposition to give up when they find that they have lost them. If they are prepared for such an emergency beforehand, they will meet it as they should.

We still have it in our power to organize and put out handsome armies in the spring, if we will only go to work with proper feeling and spirit. I fear that too much time will be taken up in con-
