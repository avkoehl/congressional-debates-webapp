WINF'D S. HANCOCK,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, September 9, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Deserters from Mahone's division, who left their picket last night, report no addition to the forces in this vicinity. They say there is considerable despondency among the Georgia troops since Sherman's victory. Three of them belong to the Third Georgia. General Grant's order is getting to be known, but there is much talk of the terms on which deserters will be received, few having a chance to see the order.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

General WILLCOX:

I am about making an attack to obtain the enemy's pickets in my front, the right and left of the plank road. The troops going in will probably come out at the Strong house, a little to your right. The hour fixed is 1 o'clock.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,Major-General.
