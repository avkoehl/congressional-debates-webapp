Public Lands—Mr. Clifford.
H. of Reps.
lusion which has been created by the remarks of
the gentleman who has preceded  me.    The greit
body of the public lands now undisposed of, were
obtained by purcba5e through  the  treaty making
power from foreign Government !, and paid for out
of the common Treasury of the Union   Louisiana,
including that immense tract of country  west of
the Missis ippi, which is an empire of itself, was
purchased   of  Prance   in April 1803,  and   the
Floridas were purchased of Spain,  Febuary 22,
1319, end p%td for in  like manner    These two
purchases constitute mne-tpnths of the great inhe-
ritance of the Union and of the Constitution, which
it is now proposed to mortgage to the stockjob-
bers of our own country, and the fundholdtrs of
Europe    It is an inheritance capable of yield ng
an annual income equal to one-fourih part of ihe
revenue which wiU be necessary t  detray the car
rent expenses of the Government for a century to
come    No o her Govrnmen' on earth has a pro-
perty  of suco mfini e ■• alue, and none can b 
found m my estnna ion fool sli enough io «qua der
it away for ihe miserable purpo es contemplate tin
this b 11    In my opinion the people do not de ire
it, if we had the power under the  Consutation to
pa s the act.   The reasonable expenses of this
Government must be defrayed.   Why  part wi h
this fund, and immediately call upon tie people lo
contribute it back?    But it is sa d the States are in
debt aid in need of relief   'o is this Government,
according to the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, and if no re lance can  be placed upon
that, every one must know that it will b  in debt
if this measure prevails, and that the whole amount
of this appropriation must be collected from  th>
people oí the States by a tax upon the necessaries
of life.
But let me proceed with the argument m its ap
plication to the whole ¡subject matter of this great
con rover y. We are till met with toe assump
Hon that ibe whole pul he domain is held by the
United States as the trustee of the S ates, m what
sense, or oi wh^t account, the gentlema i has not
condescended to explain Where is the deed, in
strument, or treaty, creating this trust? No where,
it cannot be found, and has not been produced, and
yet this floating, imaginary idea of a trust esint?,
runs throughout the gentleman's rem?rks> Weil,
sir, intangible as the theory is, I will endeavor to
meet it Fortunately for myself, I have been fur-
nish d w th a statement Irom the General Land
f ffice that will enable me to satisfy the genii man
from Maryland thit he has o limited a greater
erroi upon this subj3c' than he did in regard to me
revenue from wines.

exposed.   It appears tome that if my fneno. from

ther, he would have found leason for withholding
the statement which hs made,  that tie National
Treasury had been benefited more than twenly
millions of dollars from the sa e of lands    It is
nearly fifteen millions out  of pocket if this docu-
ment be correct, making a mistake in his calcula-
tion of thirty-five millions of dollars.    A mistake
pur-ly unintentional   I hate no   doubt,  and one
tasily made from the confu ion Uat exists in the

Mr CLIFFORD resumed his remarks from yes
terday, and, after expi lining some port on of t em
as reported in the National Intelligencer, makii g
certain corrections to prevent wrong inferences be-
ing drawn from that report, and after declaring
hiTse'f m favor of a duty upon wine3 and other
luxun ■=, as far as it could be imposed by the trea-
ty stipulations of the country, to supply the defl-
c ency to be created in the revenue by the operation
of existing laws, or with the view to a further re-
ducti n on the neces anes of life, proceeded further
to í'lustiate the effect and operations of the mea-
sure asfoliow-
Mr Chairman It is said that the whole public
domain is held by this Government as trustee for
the Sta'es    In what sense can this Government be
regarded as the trustee of the States as to that por-
tion of the territory  which was purchased from
France and Spain?   I repeat the inquiry, how can
th s b ?    The States were not the grantors; they
d d not coniey the land, or any part of i', the land
was purchased une'er the ireaty making power of
the Constuut oi from  foreign  Goveintn-nts, the
S a'e!, therefore, are not interested from the fact
tnat any port on «f the land was granted by them.
This   ground,   therefore,   fai's    They   not only
did  not   convey   the   land,    but   they   did  not
pay    the   consideration   s ipnlated  in   the   trea-
ties, or   any   part   of   it,   nor  did   the  States,
as   Stales, that   is,  in   their sovereign capacity,
furnish the means or any portion of them to fu!|il
those treaty stipulations w th the ceding powers
1 hen is it not true that the States did not grant the
land or furnish the means of payment? How, then,
has the trust been created?   No one disputes Ihe
fact that this large and almost boundless tract of
country,con ti utmg nearly nine hundred millions of
acres, was purchased in the nnnner before Mated,
and it is equally clear tnat it was paid for vuth the
common treasure of the TJi ion, gathered from the
whoie people,into the cor/mon Treasury,!!)rough the
medium of the laxirg pc wer ot Congress, and as it
is agreed on all hands, mamlv if  not entirely from
duties on imports     Let me inquire, for amonent,
mio the operation of the taxing power, and, upon
whom its  burdens fall?    The   answer is easily
made.    Its operation is upon the  whole people of
the country without distinction of class or condition,
and not upon ihe States m their sovereign capacity,
among whom the benelts of th s bill will be distri-
buted, and  the burden  fal s upon the consumer
The operation of the taxing power, even when car-
ried out under  ihe wi est lawt, m unequal, and
oftcnt ires oppressive su d unjust    No oí e that has
examined tnc ta 1} tinff' vs can en enamadoubt
thit a very la-ge p rt on o   tie monpy  paid for
Looi'ianaat d he floridas mast have been collected
from the peopie by the t p ran r of duties laid upon
then crss?n<.s oí life, p€ d mto the common Treasu-
ry, under hereqnirementsof the la^s of Congress.
I  ih s be true, I contend that if any one is to be
Rgaried as cestui que lrv.it, i' is the whole people
and not the State , an i that it any distribution is
to be made, that Congress is boi'nd to make its dis-
tributive portions per capitem, and send th  money
to those upon wnom the burden of the fulure con-
tributions that must inevitaoly br made, if the bill
shall become  a law, vv 1 ¡a!,aiil  ¡gione step
farther, and declare it ti be m) op nion, that if the
measure   prevail,  m  some   rt   tie New   Eng-
land & ales  a per capita division of the money will
be made, in spue of the provisuns of your law—
as it via   done on a former (cession wiih the de-
po i'e money     The operation of pny law distri-
buting the pubhc revenue will be unequpl, giossly
unequal, and unjust   Butsutpo e it «eieota<.rwi e,
