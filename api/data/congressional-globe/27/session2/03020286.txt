fli MOORE said that he had examined the report, and
made some calculations, which produced iome curious results
And, as the subject was again brought befoie the House, he
would make the statement, whichwould ¡=how conclusively, as
he thought, that the resolution of the committee should be
adopted as a wise and salutary measte, and calculated t«
reduce the contingent expenses, and prevent waste and extrava
gance
According to the report, the stationery for the 23d Congress)
was—

«11,443 00
Since then no separate account has been kept
It will be ftrceived that stationery for the Clerk's office is
aboutone seventieth cf t le whole expenditure The stationeiy
for the committee t ooms would probably mciease the amount
to aboutone twentieth Then 1 would staid thu

Ii. was also proper to rematk that many of die members, par-
ticularly from the Western portion of the country where there
were butfew newspapers, brought with them the full list of the
electors id then lespective dismets, and sent through the post
office, every public document, abo speeches &c to each ot
these electors The paper in which th^se documents, speeches^
newspapers, &c were folded, was f jrnibhed by the Govern^
ment, but the newspapeisand speeches weie paichaeed by th©
.members themselves Many members as Mr W, had under-
stood expended several hundred dol ars every session m pur
chasing these documents, &t* foi the information of their con
stituents The additional expense of envelope paper, folding,
&c was now piovided forfout of the contingent lund Whether
* it was expedient to deprive thembers of this facility, and there
bv prevent them from afftuding light tn public questions to
then constituents must be left to the decision of the party now
in power But, said Mr W I do not hesitate to say that, if you;
wish to make any saving m the way ol stationery, you must
co Timonee with the envelope papei, for, if this resource is left
open then, I repeat, the contingent expenses of the House will
be increased, rather than diminished, by the «doptionofthts
revolution
The greatest amount of money evei expended, in anyone
yeai,foi stationery 'or the use of this House, was thirty five^
thousand dollars, but it wis due to the Clerk who made the
pun bases, to state that, at the close of the t Ongress for which
it was bought, there wa& a large poition of it left 011 hand It
wab now his purpose to show that there would be no saving to
the Government, m case this resolution should pass The
amount oflcttei paper furmshe 1 to the House n any one year,
never exceeded $5 000 the whole of which sum, divided among
the ¡-) em bet-3, w ukl give biU about twenty dollars to eaeh
instead of th°bum of tvven y five, now ptopo^ed
But, if m is be rerna k&d that buch an amount of letter pa
pei was nevei used by th" members alone From tne amount
mu-'tbededjcted the letter papei u ed by the cíe ks and officers
i f the Hou& , 11 the committee rooms ¿nd by ife Reporters, se*
the amnu it usel by each mernoei nevei rose vo high as fifteen
dollars for any one session Piow he -vis \m11h g to go further
than the committee, and vote tj hmi t the supply to that sum,
oi, if the majority o*" this House being of the party now m
power, thought proper to deprive the membeis altogether of
stationery of any kind, he would not undeiiake 10 oppo&e it
Still be would beg leave to say that tneie was not a legislative
body in this Union that did not supply its members with sta
tionerv,and that, toOj without any complaint on the part of the
public, and it seemed to him (Mi W^kd) that it was just that
stationery should a'so be supplied ior the useof membeis of
this body
The íesolution, m 1 s present shape, was unjust and unequal
m regaid to its application to membeis of the lit use There
were a number of individual members on this floor whose cor
respondence necessan v exceede 1 in amount that of any ten
members who weie diffeiently situated Tb s was the case
with members apresen mgfhe lai^e com lerciai cities, where
were piaced qui custom ho ises írintn, pimcipal post office^
depositories of the public moneys, navy yt*rds, &c whose cor-
respondence of couise greatlv exceeded his own, or that of
members residing m themtenoi, but yet provision was made
by the íesolution to give hi in ard every member similarly si-
tuated the same amount of paper tha was allowed to the mem
ber* referred to The resolution was unjust also, m regard to
the Delegates from Terntoiies Their correspondence was ne
cessanly very ex'ensive, and yet no provision was made to
allow them any greater amount of stationery than there was
a'lowed to membeis w! 0 e corr°spond<=nce was very limited,
