So the motion to postpone was not agreed to.
The question then lecurred upon ihe passage of 1
the hill " :

nays; winch were ordered. 1

be in outer to move to reconsider the vote by

mit his remntks, (xcopt by the unanimous con-
sent of the House.

The SPEA K ER, It will be in order.

unteers ordered out by the Governors.

TfTK COMMISSION IjMJER ItiU Cs>.\ V
WITH BR.VZIL.
Mr. j^AYLY. ^Ir. Speaker, there is a bill
upon the Sneaker's table winch it j* indispensable
that we should pass inimedtati iy, or it will be too
hue lo ha\e any ellect. I ask thai the J]ous^  will |
lndid^e me foi a single nio.iicut. 1 tliink 1 uui
^;ho\v thii.t st 13 a bill a^aiust which there < nu bo tio ,
po^sible objection. j
A Miimriui. What if; voiu bdP
Mr. Fi\Y]jY. That is pifjsfdy what I w.uir 1
to .state. [Lau^-'tfr. j Cinder our ri m w.ntion w ith 1
lji*a/aU the penod of the r^jslence of the Doaid
for adjudicating American chii ns will expue tjus ;
week, in conseqnence of the .auilhctui': tcMuno-
ny, over the wide extent o{ Bra/il, flies e .>re sonit,
of the claimants w ho h.ive noi been <)bie to inrfect
their testimony. The whole fund oo' di.>i.. ibnfail,
aad the commissioner's sa'ary io|.rovided tbrtbnr
months lender th.xn the peiiod at winch his duties
by huv terminate. The Pre?,idem recommends,
and the commissioner ImuseH" says it is bui jns-;
tire, that tin* peiiod s'.iould be extended, and ilia.'
is all we ask :
Mr. TOOMBS. I ask permission to say, that .
there is already an appropriation made to pay the ,
salary of the American commissioner to the end
of the fiscal year.
Mr. I>AYLY. Yfs, his salary is already pio- '
%ided for: and the only question is, whether h'c-
time shall be ^iven for the investigation of' tlnve
cases ff it ix not, these American cLim-mrs will
be the lo r>r, and the Court of Braz'i are the (
frainei".
\[ Mr. SCURiyr. Will not the consent of Bra-
'■ zil have to be oouiined ?
J; Mr. BAYLY, it will not.
I j Mr. GENTRY. If [ understand the gentle-
; man's exjjlanation, if we do not pass the bill, we
shall have to pay the salary of the commissioner
I for four months for doing nothing. But if we do
j' pass it, we shall have to pay nothing in addition,
i' and the commissioner will be at work during the
j four mouths m the performance of his commission.
, Mr. BAYLY. That is its effect.
I The joint resolution extending1 the time for the
jj continuance of the commission under the conven-
j tion with Brazil, was taken up, and read a first and
second time by its title.
! Mr. FL^RENCR. I do not understand the
object of extending the time.
Air. BAYLY It is because the time is limited,
_ and after it has expired, the commissioner cannot
!' adjudicate another claim. There are claimants
II who, from the extent of country over which they
have boon obliged to collect their testimony, have
not been able t«) complete it m time.
!: Mr. FLORENCE. How manygentlemen have
prevscttt^d claims which have not been adjudicated?
j Air. BAYL"Sr. There are a few more. I do
<! not know the precise number,
j Mr. FLORENCE. Is not the number thirteen?
|! Mr. HAYLY. T think it is.
,| Mr. FLORENCE. l-Jow many have been pre-
:j sented in all'
!| Mr. BAYLY. T do not know the precise
! number.
: Ms. TOOMBS. I am told that these claimants
,, mr very anxious to have this tune extended, and
| I hope in ju>t cc to them it wiil be done.
; M r. FLORENCE. I merely asked the questions
, for mforh'ation, and 1 am entirely satisfied.
| The bi'l was ihen ordered to be engrossed and
] rend a ihird tunc; and having been engrossed, was
read the rliird time and passed.
PRIVATE BILLS.
! Air. BOWJE. I will inquire if there are not
, some balls on the Speaker's table which were re-
ported from the Committee of the Whole last
j Friday, and which have not been acted- upon by
the 11 ouse?
The SPEA l£Elt. There are several.
Mr. BOWIE. Then I will move that those
, biU.s be disposed of before we <*o into Committee
of the Whole.
