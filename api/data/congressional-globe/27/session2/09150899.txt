if they believe him to be guilty of any impeacha-
ble offence.   If he has neither assumed power, nor
abused it corruptly, then the issue dwindles to a
mere question—who is right as to a measure of pol-
icy?   If the undersigned were allowed, by the cir-
cumstances which compel him to omit many con-
siderations very proper to the subject, be would not
despair of showing that, independent of all ihe ex
traneous prejudices and political feelings which the
advocates of errcr on this occasion  endeavor to   '
bring to their aid, the mere opinion of the Execu-
tive in this case  is right, and the mere opinion of
Congress is wong.   The narrative of legislation
on the subject of revenue, at the late extra sesión,
and since December last, which hss been given,
will furnish the fae s from which, without expi-
ration or argument, the country will bs enabled to
judge whether the majority in Con?ress or the Pres-
dent have erred in matters of opinion   The occasion
is boih too novel and too grave to permit an argu
mentón such minor questions, affectn g the compa-
rative ta^te or wisdom of ihe majori y of Congress
and the President   As to t'iemere question of opin-
ion, however, the President  should not be con-
demned, wit tout some chanty by those who con-
curred with him so recently as September, 1841
If the charge preferred by this majority is under-
stood, it involves no breach of the Constitution, or
of any law on th  pirt of the President, bi >  they
accuse him of obstructing their will    The accusa-
tion implies either a general infalhbih y on the
part of the accusers-, or a particular exemption
from error on this occasion, or it d m s to  tne
President the nglt and th« re poi s t ihty oí judg-
ing on a subject uhicb Congress tubmi  ed  to his

Congress aie leqmred to send to him all bills vhich
they pass    It is al'eped, however, as a comolaint,
that the President has thought proper to exercre
his constitutional discretion, and withheld his ap-
probation from other bilis which Congress have
passed    Sill,  the question  of  pow r   anl   the
question  of  duty   on his  part, p^d on the part
of Congress, is the s&r • m each mlarce    Can
Congress excuse themselves for refus ng to   pro-

the   i">sue,   which   has   been   so   solemnly   nro-
claimed on thu, occas on, to enbiace the long a°i-
tated question of currency, besides that of revenue?
Do the majority mean io declare that they will per-
mit no revenue to be collected (or, in c ¡her words,
that the Government shall coa^e) unless two condi
tions are submitted  to   fits', the charter of a bank
in some forci, and, second, the d stnbution of the
land fund?    If this be the ooject/ then these ques-

Its existence is conceded by the proposition to
abolish it. It is no' whether that power has been
corruptly abused If thi«¡ is believed, the majority
are guilty of culpable neglect of duty in not im-
peaching It is not whether th* Slates «hall have
the land fund, it u, not whether the United Slates
shall have a revenue, but it is whether this Gov
ernment shall have revenue, and the States shall
have the land fund iu a particular form of legisla-
tion, which Congress have resolved, at all hazards,
to persevere in—a form oflegislation resorted to,
first, t\ coerce the votes of Congress, and persisted
in to cderce the Executive/by putting the treasury
under dyresse.               /

question,\t u a mere/par íamentary puncilio, on
which sorhe of them would rouse the country
to arms, m other/asprcts, however, in which it
will be viewed by* those who, in this case, are
more impartís^ arbiters than either this majority oi
the President, ¡| h a question worthy c f the most
serious consideration The Government has now
no revenue It*s in debt, it is completely organ-
ized under the forms of the Constitution, its Legis
lature, its Judiciary, its Executive, are at their
posts, its army is in the field, its nsvy i on the
sea, its representatives are honorably accredited
by all fore gn Governments as the representatives
of foreign Governments are here There is pro-
found Deace and a general s^i se of security
throughout the country Our fields are teeming
with abundant harvests Industry and economy
are gradually repairing the evils of extravagance
and índohnce, and, as they develop cur great
national resoorces, they are restoring a general
confidence, which will levive ptospenty, and te?ch
us ((or a time, at least) the dangei ot preferring
again artificial wealth and oelu ive spl-nder to
real independence and suds antial comfort With
the means of individual happ ness pnd nsttoial
g'ory withm our reaci, the people of tl <• United

irgs in this case are in conflict with the Constitu-
tion. It is to-be regretted that it is not the only-
evidence of a disposition, during the present Con-
gress, to disregard the authority of thtt instrument,
or to create unnecessary collisions between the
Legislative ard the Executive Departments
When a subject distinctly embraced in one bi'l ha«
been the causs of the Executiva objections to that
bill, respect for the opinion of a co-ordinate de-
partment, or desire to avoid unnecessary collis-
ions with it, would suggest the propriety of not
immediately pressing that identical subject upon
the consideration of the Executive, without some
intimation of a change of opinion. The objec-
tions of the President to ihe provisional reve-
nue bill, and the general revenue bill, are the
same They relate to the insertion of a clause
directing distribution of the land fund without re-
gard to the rates cf duties on imports The first
bill was temporary m its duration, and compara-
tively unimportant in its objects It was sent to
the President in advance of the second, and only
five days prior to the 30th of June, when it was
alleged there would no longer be authority to col-
lect revenue. It contained a clause in relation to
the distribution of the land fund It wps vetoed
on aceount of that clause On the 5th of August,
Congress passed the second or general revenue bill,
containing a ciause still more unequivocally au-
thorizing distribution, notwjthstandmg tap 20 per
cent, restriction of the act of 1841 Wnether the
first of these bills v as designed only to le-1 the
way for the «econd, pnd to ascertain if the P-esi-
dent could be brought to the dilemma, after ob-
jecting to that bill, of either vetoing a revenue bill,
or submitting to the distribution cKuse, i« order to
obtain tbe means of canying on the Ooven ment,
or to re-e-iart, by tne vote of a majoiity, a single
pnnciple which had bee i so recently vete ed, and
«Inch could not obtain the vote ot two third ,i is
apart of the history of thp^e proceedings which
may sh d some light on cur examinations The
legislation of Congress, at the late extra session,
on the subject of the bank and its var oos i edifi-
cations, lllustra'es the same disposition T«o bills,
under different titles, hut both for the obj-ct of
charter ng a national bank, ware sur-ce sively
passed, sent to the Executiv, and were re'u ned
wi h objections If, then there nas been a oppo-
sition on the part of the Ex eutive to resist the ac-
tion of Congi ess on certain subjects, there Has cer-
ta i ly been a corresponding di position on be part
of Congress to attack, and to repeat the a *?c'i , on
he Executive
Congress have appropriated the moi ey required
t) carry en the Government They have author-
ized the debt ■> which are contracted They alone,
under tne Constitution, can furnish means of
m<-etirg their own appropriations It is not in the
power of the rmticnty of Congress to legis'att.
All that the Executive can do is to convene Crn-
gress, should it adjourn without providing revenue
io carry on the Government It is hoped, how-
ever, that calmer consideration will inspíreseme
m itive of pub ic d^ty s'ronger than any feelings
oí party resentment The ihrcat-s of violence whicn
