MAJOR: I send rough sketch of my surroundings; + very imperfect. For want of skillful draughts man, I have had to do it myself, and it is my first effort. Some indistring idea of the country may he obtained from it.

There are two roads by which Trenton, Ga., can be reached without exposure to artillery from the other side of the river, viz, one from Shellmound, up Nicojack Cove, and one from this point by Moore's Spring, &c. The latter is the better of the two. There is able also a road leading out from mouth of Island Creek, but it is perhaps hardly practicable for artillery.

i am, major, very respectfully, &c.,

PATTON ANDERSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
