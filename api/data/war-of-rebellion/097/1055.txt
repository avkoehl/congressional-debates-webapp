keeping away provisions and supplies, compels the military to feed a large starving population. If trade were left with no other restrictions than those provided by law this evil would soon be removed. It was understood that the orders issued removed all other restrictions, but Treasury agents give a different interpretation, and permit no one to trade without special authority from Washington.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, D. C., May 1, 1865. (Sent 9.10 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Richmond:

The Treasury trade system bids fair to be more nefarious and oppressive than ever before, and all the efforts we have made seem to result in giving them a harder grip and more plunder. I see no other remedy than to drive them away or arrest them. But to-morrow I will bring it before the Cabinet.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

RICHMOND, VA., May 1, 1865.

(Received 11 a.m.)

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

Would it not be well to retain here all regular troops of Meade's and Sherman's commands, and to fill them up with recruits preparatory to mustering out the volunteers? Many of the latter express a strong desire to get home in time to put in their corps. I understood from the Secretary of War that when Sherman left North Carolina that State fell within my command. Is it so understood still?

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General HALLECK,

Richmond, Va.:

Please order Generals Foster and Harris, Twenty-fourth Corps, and Kautz, Twenty-fifth Corps, to Washington, to be here by Thursday next.
