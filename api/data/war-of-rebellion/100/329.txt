HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Raleigh, N. C., April 27, 1865.

General J. H. WILSON, Commanding Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: The negotiations which have been progressing for some days, and which may have led to conflicting orders to you, are now complete. I send you a copy of the convention,* signed by General Johnston and myself, together with copies of my orders to carry out its terms. # You may treat the prisoners in your hands as under the convention, and have all sign an obligation such as contemplated in it. After you have concluded this business, I want your cavalry about Decatur, whence they can be sent according to further developments. I regard the war as over, but it is well to be prudent and cautious, as there is much danger of some of the discharged soldiers of both armies infesting the country as robbers. If you encounter any of these either punish them with extreme severity or carry them where the civil authorities of an organized State can try and punish. I will order so that, if feasible, you can get supplies at Savannah or Augusta.

Yours, truly,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
