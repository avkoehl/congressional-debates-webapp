them to stay in this country, and therefore leave their homes at present. They are more encouraged since my arrival to go to work on their farms. Even some families that have left are returning again. I think that I can keep the Indians all right; even, if necessary, organize some of them for my assistance. This point here is not the proper place. I shall go twelve miles farther down the Walnut Creek and make station at El Dorado, which is about two miles from the Indian Reserve. There I have a better opportunity for scouting and getting information. If I shall remain here, please send me orders without delay and twenty day's rations and forage for twenty-two men. I shall start to-morrow morning for the Indian line. The distance from here to Riley is 115 miles, the nearest military points.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. WISE,

First Lieutenant Company D, 2nd Colorado Cav. Vols., Commanding Detach.

P. S. - The Indians that General Ford attempted to fight are retreating to this part of the country, as some have got here already. They are scared. I think they will make a treaty. This I hear from a man just returned from Little Arkansas.
