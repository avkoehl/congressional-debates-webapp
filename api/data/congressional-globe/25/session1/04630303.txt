APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,

Postponement of fourth instalment—Mr, Daivson.
H. of Reps,
labor I would like very well to see that gentleman
advancing upon the tic r¡h with his insurrectionary
lntent.ons It would gratify me much to see him
at ihe head of his new-raised cohorts, with his ban
ner* floating upon the breeze, and, under the inspir-
ation of martial mu^ic, marching forward " to
preach the universal emancipation of northern la-
bor from northern fraud and duplicity"' The
holder of slaves at the South, preaching insurrec-
tion to the honest, intelligent, and independent la-
borers of th<? north' It would be an exhibition
worthy to attract more than the gaze of curiosity
Sir, the gemleman misunderstands the character
of our institutions the character of our people, the
character of our labor If he will come to the
north, I will gladly mtrojuce him to ottr farmers
in then fields, to our mechanics at then benches,
to our manuiacturois at their looms He will find
them a body of men aole and ready to explain to
him what is meant by northern labor, and what is
the character of northern institutions. He will
find them full of genera! intelligence, possessed of
a perfect knowledge of their own rights, and pre-
pared to maintain them. Let me tell the gentle-
man he will not find them very patient listeners to
hii, "pieachmg of insurrection " He will not find
them flocking to the standard of a slaveholder, as
he pioclairas to them the way to " universal eman-
cipation from northern fraud and duplicity "
Sir, the gentleman misunderstands the nature of
our banking institutions and other corporations, as
much eu> he does the character of our labor They
are not engaged "in enslaving and subjecting ihe
laboring class   They are themselves the labor-
ing class The men ot business of the north, the
men who m?nage and control all the&e institutions,
are the great middle class of -ociety—the men who,
by their own industry and intellect, have made
themselves what they are The banking institu-
tions are owned not by the great capitalists, but by
the active, thuvmg, and eneigetic men of business
The proprietorship of these institutions is, for the
most part in the hands of the men of moderate pro-
perty, of females of orphans, of charitable societies
I do not stand here as the apologist or the advocate
of banks Much, very much, they may have done
wrong Tney pie m the hands of the people at all
times, for legulation and reform Sir, I will not
detain the committee, but I cannot avoid asking
permission to read a passage from a letter of a dis-
tingmshed«personage upon this subject, which ex-
presses, bttt^r than I can do it, what I deem to he
the truih upon this subject The letter was ad-
die>sed to tne Chairman op the Committee of Ways
anil Means, of the Congress before the last.
" If there were no State banks, the profitable
business *o£ bankitg and exchange would be
monopolized by the great capitalists Operations
of this sort requ re capital and credit to large ex-
tent , and a private individual m moderate circum-
stances would be unable? to conduct them v*ilh any
advantage It is pioper that the business of bank-
ing and exchange should be open, as far as prac-
ticable, to the most free competition, and its ad-
vantages shared bv all classes of society Individu-
áis of moderate means cannot participate in thtm,
unless they combine togelher, and, by the union of
nvny small sums, create a large capital, and estab-
lish an extensive credit It is impossible to accom-
phsh this object without the aid ot acts of incorpo-
ration. The incorporated banks, moreover, under
proper management, will offer a safe and con-
venient investment of small sums, to person*- whose
situations and pursuits disable them from employ-
ing their money profitably in any other mode
*' No commercial or manufactmng community
could conduct its business to anv advantage, with-
out a liberal system of credit, and a facility of ob-
taining money oh loan, when the exigencies of
business may require it This cannot be obtiined
without the aid of a piper circulation, founded on
ciedit  
This is the language or the present Chief Justice
of the "United States, when Secietiry of the Trea-
sury , and here I leave the bonks
Let the gentleman fiom South Cirolma proceed
in his insurrectionary project against the labor and
the institutions of the north. He looks for aid
from the operation  ot this sub-Treasury scheme
It might aid him, it is true , but with whom, that
i* sound hearted, ^ ill that consideration recommend
the scheme? Let the gentleman proceed He
will return from the campaign mortified as well as
instructed His purpose is-vain, his threats are
impotent. As well might he attempt a crusade
against the grave-yards of the north, and seek to
spread rum and destruction over the memorials of
our dead, as exppct to carry on a v;aifare, with
any hope of success against the mduotry, the en-
terprise, the sagacity, the honor of New England
and the north
SPEECH OF MR. DAWSON,
Of  Georgia
[As reported in the TSational Intelligencer ]
In the House of Repret,entativp<! Wednesday September
27 1S-37— On the bill to postpone the payment to the States of
the fourth instilment of the suiplus revenue
Mr DA V\ SON said he would apologize to the House for
participan i" in this discusión at this time He would not have
Attempted it, bu . Horn the peculiai position in which he was
placed mrela ion to ihe question under consideration I pm
pose (said "Mi D>makin,T my observations buef I do not in
tend sir m the investigation of this sublet, to follow aftei the
arguments of many honorable Gentlemen who have cWusbed
ir 1 understand the onl> question now presented to the con
sidei anon of this body n, whetr er we shall postpone the depo
«ite of the fourth instalment of the «onrlus with the Slates
To that question then, and to that question alone, en will I
confine my observations, and endeavot not to go beyond the
limits that should be pre ci bed to that subject And sit m
oidei to ascertain some important and leading facts m relation
to it, it will be incumbent upon me, a a prelimmaiy step to
propound some questions to honorable gentlemen and more
especially to the than man of the Committee of Wavs and
Means for,if I know myse'f lean confidently aver that my
vott, will bf, the result of an honest convict) n upon my mind,
and a deep sen^e of the duty I owe mj constituents an the
cnuntrv Sir, if T could, on a question like this, be influenced
by any jarty feeling whatever, I should hold my&elf utteily
unworthy to re present th<v*e who «ent me here
For the purpose then Mr Speikei of discussing this snb
jectmost unelei tan lin<*l> and oi presenting the tacts as tluv
exist, I will n^l thf h noriblc cliujrman i>f the C"< mmntee of

then propose to pass the bill on the C'erk stable, ¿naming m
dulgenceto those banks known as the depone banks?
Mr Cambreleng I will answer the gentleman's question
as well as I ean I can only answei for my own vo e but, m
reference to that bill which proposes principally to grant In
dulgenceto the banks in the southwestern country, I will give
it as my opinion, that I ha\ e no doubt it will pass this House
by a Jaige majou y I shall certainly give it my zealous sup
port
Mr Ravvsov Very well I have a response to that I also,
Mr Speake before I go into ihe argument, wish to ack gen
tiemen from the State of New York, and the chairman of the
Committee of Wavs ind Means esp^ciallv whether th° banks
m the State of ISew \ork ate considered as solvent oi m&ol

of the Tinned States    They are as sound at this moment as they
ever weie I et the New York banks resume specit payments
wi en th«y wit!, the bunks olO n wi'l follow suit One of the
largest banks in the ¡state is now p >mg specie The bank at
I>a\ ton has never, in fact ceased to do so more than a lew
d<i)s Ohio is willing to take her share of the deposites in hills
of her own hanks and if she shall leceive more, she will givfe
am pie security that the deposites m her banks tvill he, at all
times, foithcommg m no esas good as silver
Mi Duncan still insisted that it was a fact, if an individual
wanted to convert Ohio bank paper into specie he must pay tea
pei cent discount upon it
Mr IlA-uBRiematkeri that the notes of the little bank refeired
to as bem* m his district were as good as any other, as tar as
they circulated
Mr Whittles * expla ned that he himself knew nothing
about that bank, furthet than that, by the advertisement oí the
State Tieasurer, he saw its notes weienot receivable in pay
ment ot taxes In lelation to all theothei banks of the State,
their paper was received at pai
Mr IioisD confirmed this statement
Mi D iwson I have no doubt of the accuiacy of the sta'e-
mentarall foi I have the-auihout} of the ¡secretary oftheTrea
sm> that all the bills oí the  e banks would be available at tome
penod Ihe only doubt upon my mind was, whether these
banks were solvent at thn> time, for upon that point the vote I
shall ¡rive will be chiefly governed
These fa< ts now being ascertained, I propose, Mi Speaker, to
give the reasons that will induce me to vote against this bill
Sir I am influenced by the id a oí a contract between the Gene
íal Government and the States I consider tl e law of June,
1836, directing ihe deposites tobe made with the States, in the
natuie ot a pledge on the faith of the Government, and I hold the
General Government bound to fulfil that pledge to the States,
unless consequences injurious to the interest and prosperity of
the Union demand the postponement oi repeal, or unless there
exists >n inability on the panof the Government to execute the
law    With that view let the question be examined
The Seen tary of the Tieasuiy, m his leport to this Con
gress whil t speaking of the temporary embarrassments which
the recent con\ulsions in commerce and banking may have
created s-iys "there is no ju^t cause foi despondency " The
country liis neither overwhelmed with a national debt, nor
destituie of lariie pecuniary leMHirces on Viand, but, eirtUüy
fiee from the foimei it is so am| ly supplied with the latter,
as to have in the lieasury over fouy millions of doll irs, and
eisht or ten millions mote m bonds, which will soon become
payable But a latge portion bemcc m depoeite with i\ e
St nes -md the rtsiduecltiefly m banks and in the hands, of

sufficiency cm be coi'ected appeus to be judicious, if not
indispensable The amoi it then in the Trea*my, and due
it i-, over fifty mtlhoi s if^ol'aio f this sum here is yet in
tht- dat osite ba k& ovei dm teen mill ons ¡u the hands ol mer
chants ovei ten miüums of do' ai& But the feecretaiy of the
Treasury says these funds are unavailable What does he
mean by the word unavailable? Nothing more than that the
notes clue by the banks, and the bond^ of the meichants, cannot
be converted at this instant, into specie Hence the call of
this extra session of Congress, and the difficulties and confusion
in the operations of the General Government and among the
people Tu thi-s condition of affairs, Congress is in session,
and our agent of finance i ecommends forbearance indulgente,
and kmd treatment to the depobite banks whirh owe ihe
Government upwaids of tlmteer) mil lonsof dollars \o% m,
the recommendation of the Secretuiyis, that an arrangement
be made with the banks, and the mor ey be permitted to remain
where it ruw is and the game cour e be putsued towards the
binds given by the merchants for the public due-- He then
says hence it «"ems expediert' that 'some temporary re-
