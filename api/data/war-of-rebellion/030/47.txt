HEADQUARTERS FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,Hartsville, November 14, 1862-6 a.m.

General THOMAS:

We are ordered to leave for Lebanon. We cannot do it until the regiment of infantry ordered here, with battery, arrives. I cannot leave an entire regiment of cavalry at Hartsville, in view of the fact that Forrest is reported to be at Lebanon with 6,000 men. It is not prudent to state my strength, but the Fourth Michigan, Fourth Ohio, Fourth Kentucky, Fifth Kentucky, one battalion First and Third Cavalry have been detached from my division, and the regiments comprising the division are small. We will reach lebanon to-day.
