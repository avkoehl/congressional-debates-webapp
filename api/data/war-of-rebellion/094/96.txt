WASHINGTON, D. C., December 8, 1864 - 1.20 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT, City Point, Va.:

Last returns from Department of Missouri exhibit a force present for duty (exclusive of A. J. Smith's forces) of about 19,000 men, of which about 6,000 were in and around Saint Louis. Requisitions have just been received for $20,000, to construct new barracks for the accommodation of troops in Saint Louis. From all the information I can get, Saint Louis is in no more danger of an insurrection than Chicago, Philadelphia, or New York, and that troops are required there only for the defense of the stores and for prison guards. Moreover, that Missouri is not in the slightest danger of an invasion this winter. I therefore respectfully suggest that now the commanding officer has been changed, 5,000 men from tat department can be sent to General Thomas at Nashville. In case of any real difficulty in Missouri they can readily be returned. As General Rawlins (your chief of staff) has recently visited Saint Louis, I submit the matter for your consideration.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

CITY POINT, VA., December 8, 1864 - 4 p. m.

(Received 5.30 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK, Washington:

Please direct General Didge to send all the troops he can care to General Thomas. With such an order he mat be relied on to send all that can properly go. They had probably better be sent to Louisville, for I fear either Hood or Breckinridge will get to the Ohio River. I will submit whether it is not advisable to call on Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois for 60,000 men for thirty days. If Thomas has not struck yet, he ought to be ordered to hand over his command to Schofield. There is no better man to repel an attack than Thomas, but I fear he is too cautions to ever take the initiative.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., December 8, 1864 - 9 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT, City Point:

If you wish General Thomas relieved from [command], give the order. No one here will, I think, interfere. The responsibility, however, will be yours, as no one here, so far as I am informed, wishes General Thomas' removal.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

CITY POINT, VA., December 8, 1864 - 10 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK, Washington:

Your dispatch of 9 p. m. just received. I want General Thomas reminded of the importance of immediate action. I sent him a dispatch this evening which will probably urge him on. I would not say relieve him until I hear further from him.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
