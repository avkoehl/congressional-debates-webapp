is said to be making for Jackson County. Be sure to concentrate force enough to meet and destroy him, if possible. General Brown will co-operate with you. Communicate with him.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

I will concentrate troops near Butler. I wish you would also concentrate within supporting distance, and advise me.

Brigadier-General.

KANSAS CITY, MO., October 6, 1863.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I will get 500 men, half cavalry and half infantry together at Pleasant Hill, instead of Lone Jack, to-morrow, Thursday forenoon. I will leave here to-morrow night. Have General Brown communicate with me there. I will have infantry in wagons, and will have six howitzers.

Brigadier-General HOLLAND,

Enrolled Missouri Militia, Springfield, Mo.:

Call out all the militia of your district which you can make available in the pursuit of Shelby. Prevent his escape into Arkansas if possible.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE BORDER,Kansas City, Mo., October 6, 1863.

Colonel WILLIAM WEER, Commanding Troops in the Field:

COLONEL: I send copies of three dispatches from General Schofield, one reporting Shelby passing through Carthage yesterday,* another reporting his passing through Greenfield+ this morning; also a telegram as to depredations as to which be careful, for there is a good deal of feeling against me already among Missourians, which will not be lessened by plundering. Don't let the troops take stock except from guerrillas. Make them let Brown's people alone. You know the second tier of counties is in Brown's district now. If your advices do not differ from the second dispatch of General Schofield, you will move in the direction of Clinton, where General Brown is, as General Schofield telegraphs me, and open communication with him, and, if necessary report to him.

I will leave here to-morrow afternoon, with about 500 men and six howitzers, via Pleasant Hill, at which point I wish you to communicate with me, and let me know all you have heard and where you are. I cannot believe Shelby will venture up as high even as Sedalia with but 2,000 men, and am inclined to think his force will break up into several bodies for a few raids and then disperse.

Very respectfully, yours,

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
