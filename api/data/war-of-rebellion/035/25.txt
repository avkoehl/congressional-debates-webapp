MURFREESBOROUGH, January 30, 1863.

Brigadier General R. W. JOHNSON:

A large force of rebel cavalry at Triune, on its way to Franklin or Nolensville. Could not General Davis get ready and surprise them in the morning at daybreak? If not, how near could he come to it?

By order, &amp;c.

Respectfully,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.

MURFREESBOROUGH, January 30, 1863.

Colonel J. T. WILDER, Nashville:

Combine your command with that of General Steedman. The general has a movement in contemplation for you.

By order:

C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MURFREESBOROUGH, January 30, 1863.

Brigadier General R. B. MITCHELL, Nashville:

The general commanding directs me to inform you that a large force of rebel cavalry is reported as Triune, on its way to Franklin or Nolensville. He thinks Steedman and Wilder would make a good expedition to Franklin. Perhaps you can strengthen them with a regiment.

Respectfully,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.

MURFREESBOROUGH, January 30, 1863.

Brigadier General R. B. MITCHELL, Nashville:

If practicable, would prefer that Colonel Wilder's command would come forward here, and that you should re-enforce Steedman with two good regiments, so that he can hold Franklin against all the cavalry they can bring. Our expedition moves to-morrow for their rear, and Wilder is to form part of another.

Respectfully,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.

MURFREESBOROUGH, January 30, 1863.

Major-General WRIGHT, Cincinnati:

General Halleck telegraphs me that all the troops in your department are under your command, and that he has dispatched you to send me all you can spare. Please assume command, and order the Second Ohio Regiment of Cavalry, at Camp Chase, and also another full regiment, Tenth Ohio, that General Garfield reports to me as being at Cleveland, down here as soon as possible.

W. S. ROSECRANS.
