RICHMOND, VA., June 1, 1864.

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding Army of Northern Virginia:

GENERAL: My attention has been called to the absence of the field officers of the Eighteenth Mississippi Regiment, and I suppose it is but one of many like cases in your army. When officers are permanently disabled by the casualties of war, I have directed that they should be placed in the Invalid Corps. When they are incompetent or improperly absent, we should get rid of them. The places of those who are in captivity, or absent by reason of wounds, we now have the power to fill by promotion to temporary rank. I am truly reluctant to add to your labors, and realize that the circumstances are least favorable for inquiry needful to selections, and but for the necessity to have proper offices in al positions of command, would recommend postponement to a more convenient season.

Very respectfully and truly, yours,

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

HEADQUARTERS LONGSTREET'S CORPS,June 1, 1864--1 p. m.

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding:

GENERAL: In spite of us the enemy seems to be practicing his former tactics. General Hoke reports that a column of about 15,000 men with battalion of artillery has been observed passing to our right, along the Old Cold Harbor and Black Creek Church road. I will march at once to attack them.

I am, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

R. H. ANDERSON,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS LONGSTREET'S CORPS,June 1, [1864]--10 p. m.

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding:

GENERAL: Some time since I sent Colonel Sorrel to the right to ascertain how matters had gone with Hoke. He has not returned, and I should no longer defer my report. Kershaw reports that he has lost all connection with Hoke by Wofford's brigade being driven back. I fear that Hoke has likewise been driven from his breast-works. Re-enforcements are necessary to enable us to hold the position. The last report which I had from Hoke was that the enemy were pressing him with heavy forces. Hunton's brigade was sent to him, and soon afterward one of General Field's brigades was ordered to the right, but in the meantime the line was broken. The enemy having possession of our lines on the right, they must either be expelled or the present line abandoned. There is still some firing, and the enemy will undoubtedly renew the attack at daylight.

I am, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

R. H. ANDERSON,

Major-General.
