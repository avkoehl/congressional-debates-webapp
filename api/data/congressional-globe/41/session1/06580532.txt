THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 6,
Congress should interfere and give these other
parties a right to come in and contest the
question before the courts when they have no
standing in court at the time. After the ques-
tion is examined by the courts, and it is decided
whether either of them has a right, then it
may be proper for Congress to extend this
time ; but before that decision of the courts it
is entirely improper for Congress to interfere,
and I tiiink that this company ought not to
have their rights taken away from them in this
manner, it is not just to them. 1 understand
that the east side company did not for a long
time claim any right uuder the land grant
until the Legislature convened 
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. An-
thony in the chair.) The Senator from Ore-
gon will suspend his remarks. The hour of
half past one o'clock having arrived, to which
the order of the day was postponed, it is now
before the Senate.
Mr. WHjLlAMS. I will ask my colleague
if he will not allow us to take a vote on this
bill at this time. He has said pretty much all
he has to say about it.
Mr. CORBET I'. I should like to explain
this question fully, and if the Senate then de-
termine to give this right to the east side
company, for this bill virtually gives it, if
there is any technicality in the organization
of the first company 
Mr. HOWARD. I must insist on calling
up the order of the day.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I am very much obliged
to the Senator from Michigan for his courtesy
in allowing me this time. I cannot ask for any
more now ; but I shall expect that the Senate
will not allow this sort of tactics to obtain;
and I hope before the adjournment of the ses-
sion to obtain a vote on this bill.
Mr. HOW ARD. I have only fb say that I
sympathize entirely with the honorable Senator
from Oregon respecting the use that has been
made of the past half hour.
