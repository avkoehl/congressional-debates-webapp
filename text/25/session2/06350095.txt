25th fo\«' — ^D Sfss.                                  Mississippi Election—Mr. Martin.                                                       H. of Reps.
the 25th Congtess, was properly adopted by the
House
The right of the applicants to seats upon this
floor as member-,, under the election held in No-
vember last, is the,question now for consideration,
and to that question I intend to march boldly up,
as m my judgment a representative of the peopie
should do, and discuss it fairly upon its merits, nor
do I fear that I shall meet, m my way, any
ground, either of merit or technicality, that will
give me difficulty to overcome Gentlemen of ac-
knowledged ability have most zealously exerted
themselves upon this question to prove the validity
of that election they have shown much research
and industry in bringing to the view of the House
all the authority whieh could aid them m sustain-
ing it, they have left no neans unessayed w h ch
might either tend to convince the judgment, or in-
duce an acquiescence in the desired conclus on,
and, to aid in this result, appeals are made to our
passions and prejudices as partisans Th'se ap-
peals, sir, I deeply regiet, when thus brought to
bear upon i grave constitutional quemón, involv-
ing, as this does, nothing less than the elective
f i anchise
Ir taking a \ ie\, of tn s question, it is necpssary
tint we should look to the (acts and circumstances
upon which the claim of the applicants to seats
here is li unded, and to do so, it will be necessary
that I should give a bn*i history of the case
During the past sunnier, it was considered ne-
cessary by the President of the United States that
the Twenty fifth Congress should com ene its first
session on the first Monday m September last, and
for that purpose, by his proclamation, oidered
Congress to meet upon that day By the lav s oí
Missi sippi, the time fixed for the election of her
merpners to the pre'ant Congies  was the first Mon-
day and dav folic wing in Not ember last The
Governor oí that State, bv his proclamation, or-
dered an election to be held in Tuly, foi the elec-
tion of members to serve until superceded by those
to be elected in November, the time fixed by law
for holding the regular election At the election
in July the sitting members were candidates, and
w ere opposed by one of the applicant?, (Mr Pren-
tiss) and another gentleman, the result of which
wa-. then return by a !->rge majority of all the
•sous cast At the meeting cf the session thus
called, the sitting members pie'tnted themselves,
and hating participated n tin elect on of Speakei,
as is usual in such cas°s by all tue mem' crs re-
turned, were duly sworn and took their seats
Some question being made by tne honorable gen-
tleman from Virgin ir, (Mr Mírcer) as to then
right to seats as memoers, one of tne sitting mem-
bers, (Mr Ghols in ) cal ed upon the House to in-
stitute an inquiry upon the subject, all-gins, as his
ieason for doing so, that he wished the question
settled m time for him to return to M'ssissi( p , if
he should be adjudged not entr'ed, before the time
for holding the regular election in Nov ember, that
the people might be infoimed, and hold another
e'ection The House complied wlib. that rtqaest,
by the adoption of the resolution offeied by that
gentleman, lefemng the inquiry to the Cinmittce
of Elections, who, after examination, made their
report, accompanied bj a resolution declaring the
sitting members duly elected members of the Twen-
ty-fifth Congress, which res 'utun, so declaring,
was, after full examnation a^J di cu si n, adopt
ed by tin  Hojse
In addition to the legal pr°sumpti i tint the
adoption ot this reselution «a kno\> n io the r eo-
ple o Mi« is ppi tin fact ws mad Inmii to
them tino gi the nev spapers, and other channels
of c inn" ichor by the s tt ng menueis st that
before'be e'ec ion n NovembEi, the pirtois cf
that S ate weie fully n torm"d i f the m <■ su n of the
House, rnd of tne determination oí the sitting
membeis to rely upon that decision These facts
are admitted on all sidf-s of the House The ap-
plicants alone were candidates at the November
election, obtaining a majority of the votes cast for
Congress, hut less than half of the whole tote polled
at that election, and that, too, after a general can-
vass through the counties of the State by the appli-
cants, as stat-d by Mr Prentiss These, I believe,
sir, are w of the important l&ots and aieum-
stances up >n which this application is founded
There are certainly no otheis that I have heard
which tend m the slightest degree to strengthen the
claims of the appl cants
By the Constitution of the United States, this
House is madp the s >1< judge of the election, re-
turn, and quahfeatun of its members, and under
this authority wp are now called upon to determine
whether the e'ection m November lasf, under all
the circumstances attending it, has conferred the
right upon the applicants here, to seats upon this
floor as member^ of this House, as claimed by them
No gentleman upon this floor, sir, entertains a
ri gher respect and regara for the electiv e franchise
than I do, n >r is there one who would go further
than I would t« secure it to the psople in its purity,
and when, sir, 1 shall d scover any attempt to
abridge that sacred right here, or elsewhere, I shall
not be found wanting in my best eflorts for its pre-
servation and protection It has been well cal'ed
the palladium of our liberty and mstitut ons, and
if, sir, it shall turn ou' that we are forge'ful of our
duty in the disposition which we shall make of the
grave and important qjcstion under cons deration,
I shall look to the ballot box as the great corrector
of this, as it has been in most cases he-etofoie of
the wrongs commit ed by the servants of the peo-
ple And whde on the one hand I w ould be amoag
the first to sustain an election which I may be satis-
fied was fa rly macte by the people, on the other I
should with equal promptness declare invalid one
of which 1 might entei an a different opinion
Andm dec dirg qnes ions of doubtful character of
this soit, I shoo1 i feel bound to take that course
whehwoud tMeitcn least danger to this great
right, whici wcui I be to retarn it to the people for
their iuithe   "c  on
With >ut  nte mg inn the mamry at this mo
ment, of the n n r j1 ng rfliience wmeh the deci
sion of the House (light 11 ha\ e had upon the e'ec-
tors of tnp S ate of Mississippi ip rae-skuii, su

hate upon their action What, sir, do the facts
show us1 We find two gent'emer , of fine talents,
m the field, with none to oppose them, using great
exertion, peisonally and through their friends, to
induce a general vote for them throughout the
State Tne day is one of general election of all
the important ogee's of the State, and noth ng fur-
ther necessary to be done than that of adding the
names of the candidates for Congress to the ticket
in their hand, for the ppop'e to vote foi them, and
this m one of th  new Southern S ates, the popula-
tion of which is composed of enterpnsing and intel-
ligent eitiz ns, *rom each of the otner States, every

no gieat mad r oj jnnaple to influence them, not
onp thousand out of tne t nole popolat on who c st
thei'votes at that election would have failed to
vote for members to Congress Now, sir, In us
see how it did result Whv, si", the apphean s re
ceived less th<.n ha'f'he votes polled at that e¡ee ion

And, sir, I ill st-iprjpi o he- g kraei ly
that even ' s resi't s the 1( ute t e-U th t ins
eimnattdfi m that qiaiter To my mind, sir,
tbisiesu't speaks volume15, but not, as gentlemen
suppose, in'"\ oi of the ■validity of that election
\er\ far lion i' ft sat «sfies me conclu ueh that
sonic poiu'Tfid and ex'raoid naiy influerce was felt
m that election TV hat o h°r influence cou d have
had this effect, so far as the cv ¡deuce has ma le thp
disclosure, but the Bct'on. oi iLls House at the
c tiled session? And here I might ask asfam, was
not that act'on of the House not only weft calcut "-
ted to produce such a result, but would it not ne-
cessarily do so? Propound this question to any «nan
of plain common sense, and what would be tes le-
ply? In the affirmative, without doubt Then, sw,
¡r, by our action, we have prevented the peopie
from fainy expressing their opinions and will, in
the election of representatives upon this floor, can
we for one moment hesitate to correet our error
while we may, and restore to them their rights and
privileges?
My friend from Virginia (Mr Patton) seems to
suppose th.at the vote polled for the applicants,
although less than half that were cast, is extraordi-
narily large, and as proof that it is so, cites his own
election last spring, in which he says, that having
no opposition, he received, out ol a district of 5,000
voters, but 200 votes This may do m his part of
the country, but we do things very differently in the
South In my district, sir, 1 ran alone for the
Twenty-fourth Congress, and out of a district of
some 7,000 voters, I received over 6,000 votes. In
three of the largest countips, I lost less than 35
vote', and that, tjo, w nhtiut a ereat deal of exei-
tton, much less, at any rate, than Mr Prentiss in-
foimed us he Used I mention this case, b)
"Way of set-off to that of my friend from Virginia,
and although not conclusive, yet it affords some
evidence of our course in such things in the South.
But, sir, the case of my fiend from Virginia, I
presume, falls short of a parallel with the one tinder
consideration It appears that m three counties in
Mississippi, not one vote was cast for Congress
Will the gentleman say that the inhabitants of those
counties felt no interest m so important an election?
Was ther  no man in either of those counties who
wished to be represante} upon this floor? Did the
eitizens of any one county ínhis distnct, all refuse
to \ofe 'or mm? I did not so understand him to
say, noi do I suppos  it can hate been so. Can
this resu t have be n the offspring of mere chance
a! o? If so, sir, I question if the w orld shall ever
see i s like again, and certainly not, I would sav,
until the people of tne South undergo such a change
in their mode of thinking and acting, as must be
the work of many years
But, sir, m addition to the influence which the
■•esolution of the House actually had tipo , the
election m November, in preventing a full and iair
expression of the people's will, and whether that in-
fluence was properly or improperly estimated by
them, the result must control my judgment in de-
termining it to be invalid Yet I contend for'her,
that wn le that resolution remained unrescinded, it
was obligatory upon the people of Mississippi, and
rrndeied void any election held by them to fill seats
at that time oecun ed bj the s ttu g mbmbers under
it, being contrary to the la« of the case, which that
íesolu ¡on cer'ai ily   was
By the Coustitut on of the United States, as I
hate remarks I, this House '= given the exclusive
power to judge of the election, return, and quahfi
cation of its members, and in the exeicise of that
power, its decisions, emanating fiorn that instru-
ment are ec,ual m validity with the Ccnstimtion
