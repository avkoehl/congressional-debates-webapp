HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,February 18, 1865.0

General G. W. C. LEE, Commanding at Chaffin's:

General Longstreet has observed that the abatis ordered to be placed in front of your picket-line at Elliott's Salient on the 13th instant has not been attended to. He directs me to say that he desires this work to be done to-night-extending between Battery Field and Elliott's Salient, and running down to the water at the bluff, on the far side of the ravine, in front of the position and tolerably well up on the slope, so as to enable our gunners thoroughly to command any attempt to remove it.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S.- In the order of the 13th you were authorized to use one of the interior lines of abatis for this purpose.

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
