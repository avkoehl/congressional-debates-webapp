HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION,Hagerstown, Md., July 27, 1864.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY,

Cumberland, Md.:

GENERAL: A force of the enemy, estimated at one regiment of cavalry, attacked my pickets at Williamsport yesterday, but did no damage, and retired this morning. The force (400 or thereabouts) which crossed at Little Georgetown to-day retired at the approach of a regiment of my cavalry. Colonel Thoburn, First Virginia, just come in, having been cut off, reports that there has been no force at Cherry Run. Scouts report that a column has marched in the direction of Cumberland, but I do not think that any strong force has moved in that direction up to this time, as the main body of the enemy was in Martinsburg this morning with General Early. All their force is reported to have retired toward Martinsburg. I will inform you if I get any reliable information of their movements. I beg that you will send me any news that you may get concerning them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION,Hagerstown, Md., July 27, 1864.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY,

Cumberland, Md.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to request that you will direct the detachment of the Eighth Ohio Cavalry now at Beverly to report to its regiment, now at this place, relieving them, if necessary, by National Guards. The regiment (a new cavalry regiment) is suffering severely be being broken up, and the amount of duty to be performed by the division makes it desirable that all detachments should be sent to it. It is also necessary that the detachment should be sent to the regiment to be refitted for active operations. The arms which that portion at Beverly now has are almost useless, and ammunition for them can only be procured from the armory at this -. I desire to rearm them, but will be unable to do so unless I can get the regiment sent to me. Nearly all the officers are with the portion at Beverly, and the regiment here is badly in need of their services. I beg you will give your early attention to this matter.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.
