bank of the San Bernard River, halt at Churchill's Ferry, remaining on the east bank of the river. Colonel Debray will order the batteries of this brigade directly to the same point. Pyron's and Woods' regiments have been ordered from Texana, and have probably marched to Churchill's Ferry, on east side of San Bernard River. Colonel Debray will move by forced marches, as the enemy are marching o Velasco.

Colonel Debray's wagons will go loaded with corn and meal.

HEADQUARTERS,Victoria, December 3, 1863.

Colonel[T. J. M.] RICHARDSON:

COLONEL: I am instructed by the commanding general to direct that you proceed to Velasco as rapidly as possible, and send couriers on the roads to Wharton and Bernard's Station, directing all troops to make forced marches, and proceed to the east bank of the San Bernard River as rapidly as possible, going as near its mouth as possible, and there oppose the crossing of the enemy, now en route by the beach to Velasco. Artillery, cavalry, infantry, all must proceed to that point by forced marches, sending men ahead to prepare supplies of corn and meal with out delaying their march. Direct Colonel Bates, or officer in command, to send Wilson's battery to oppose the enemy crossing the San Bernard.

Debray's brigade and Buchel's brigade are coming to Lavaca, via Wharton and Texana. Send intelligent and reliable couriers to explain to them this order, with orders to show it to the commanding officers of these troops, and tell them the nearest road by which to place their commands east of the San Bernard, say at Churchill's Ferry. They must proceed with great rapidity, or Velasco will fall before the troops can reach there; proceeding thence by the direct main road to Columbia until you strike the San Bernard River, which you will cross, and march down its east bank until your reach Churchill's Old Ferry, about 6 miles from its mouth, at which point you will halt your command, remaining on the east bank of the river.

Brigadier- General SLAUGHTER:

The general directs that you throw scouts down as far as San Luis Bay, and also well down on the inside of the island to Oyster Creek, so as to communicate to you with rapidity the approach of the enemy.

You will keep artillery in readiness to defend the bridge. Should the enemy cross San Luis Bay, you will have time to throw troops into Virginia Point from the garrison, but should he not cross over, he will move up more rapidly and give you little time.

You will see that all necessary arrangements are made by which a sufficient number of steamers are ready and on hand to assist and remove the garrison should the communication with the mainland be severed.
