Estimated strength of cavalry present in General Thomas' army, 19, 1862.

Before the recent battles there were about 3,000 horses in General Hatch's command, and 1,900 of Greirson's (now Upton's) command went there mounted. The total number on hand and received to December 31 would be 27,811; estimated present strength, 19,182; broken down and lost in action, 8,629. Of these a large number are at Nashville, and are being cared for there and being returned to Louisville for recuperact. The cavalry of this division have been so actively occupied that I have not been able to get any complete reports. They report the duty as having been uncommonly severe, and it having been uncommonly severe, and it is not though that the proportion of loss in horses has been much greater than in the operations in the Valley.

I have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully your obedient servant,

WM. REDWOOD PRICE,

Major and Assistant Inspector-General Cavalry Bureau.
