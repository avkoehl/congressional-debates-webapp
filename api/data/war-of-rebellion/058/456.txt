NASHVILLE, February 24, 1864-11 a.m.

Major General J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Knoxville, Tenn.:

Should you discover by your movement on Strawberry Plains that the enemy has retreated eastward and is abandoning East Tennessee, push him as far as practicable with your whole force, destroying effectually the railroads.

Relieve Granger's troops to return to Chattanooga as soon as you ascertain the enemy is gone and cannot be overtaken by infantry. Sherman's safety in Mississippi depends upon our efforts here. Thomas in moving with apparent success on Dalton.

Major-General.

STRAWBERRY PLAINS, February 24, 1864

Major General U. S. GRANT,

Your dispatch of 11 a.m. is just received. If Longstreet is leaving Tennessee with his whole force it will be impossible to overtake him. I will try to learn positively in time to let Granger's corps join General Thomas before Longstreet can reach Johnston. I will press forward as fast as possible.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Longstreet destroyed the ferry-boat and completed the destruction of railroad bridge and retreated from this place yesterday. From the best information I can get he is moving rapidly toward Virginia
