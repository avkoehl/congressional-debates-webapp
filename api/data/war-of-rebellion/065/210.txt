SUMTER, May 14, 1864 - 8 a. m.

I have the honor to report 2 Parrotts, there 10-inch columbiads, and seventy-four 10-inch mortar shells fired at the fort since 6 p. m. yesterday; no damage done. Shelling last night very poor; of the 74 mortar shells fired 48 struck outside. One man, Peter Moser, Company C, First South Carolina Artillery, slightly wounded.

FORT SUMTER, May 14, 1864 - 11 a. m.

SIR: The fire of the enemy is at the east angle and part of the sea face near it; the monitors are firing from 15-inch, 11-inch, and, I believe, 200-pounder Parrotts the land guns same as yesterday. The engineer in charge advises me to suggest that it would be greatly to our advantage if the fire of the enemy could be diverted by our batteries at Fort Johnson and Sullivan's Island.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. C. MITCHEL,

Captain, Commanding Post.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
