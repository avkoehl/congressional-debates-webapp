to help to carry out this great and glorious re-
form
But, sir, I fear I shall appeal to him in. vain, he
has long since abandoned these noble sentiments,
for reasons no doubt satisfactory to himself, and
has even attempted to disavow them or explain
them away In some publication since, he has
attempted to destroy the entire sense and meaning
of the language I have quoted, by a forced con-
struction, making the whole sense depend on the
qualifying clause as to the channels of circulation
being filled with gold and silver Sir, no one ever
did advocate a return to the hard-money policy of
the Constitution, and the collection of the revenue
m specie, until there was gold and silver enough
in the country for the purpose No one, sir,
proposes to carry out this hard money policy until
the channels of cnculation aie filled This was
the object of the specie provision in the bill of last
session But is the Senator now in favor of col-
lecting the revenues in specie, at any lime and
wider any circumstances > Do his present objec-
tions to that policy rest on the ground hat the
channels of circulation are not full, or - they
apply to the principle of the policy itself Let his
course for the last three years answer these ques-
tions. Whatever his reasons may be, no one can
doubt that he has abandoned his hard money policy
of 1834
The next we learn of his financial notions was
in his course m regard to the deposit act of 1836
He advocated and voted for that bill, which first
legalized the connection between the Government ]
and the State banks, but piofesstd to do it with \
great íeluetanre, and only as a choice of evils   i
Immediately after its passage, a controveiby com  I
meneed among the Opposition pieces respecting
the paternity of that law     Some claimed that it
justly belonged to the distinguished Senator from j
South Carolina, (Mr  Calhouk] and others that
a distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, not
now in his seat, [Mr WlbstiiR ] was its author
and parent    But at the commencement of the next
session, the Senator from Virginia, and his fuend
from New Yoik, [Mi   Tailmadgi.,] seemed to
claim that they, if not the atuhorbof it, were chiefly
responsible for it     A measuie which they had
suppoited wuh gieat reluctante, and under a sort
of duiess, had became then favoiite measure     If
a word was said dire< tiy or in ¡dentally against it,
one 01 both ot thegeittemen immediately took the
iloor as its champion     If not their natural child,
it has certainly become their ofispung by adoption
Mr  Pitsident, those of Ub on this side of the
House, who voted foi  that messtie, also acted
under a ronvicti  n of necessity and a choice of
evili,      We consider it a measure, that could only
bejustifiej on lie ground of neeesbity, gloving out
of the peri Inr and alarmu ¿ sta e of om fin tnres
but we did not then, noi since, i efard it as nnolv
ing any com prorn s ion  of ¡ >'itical principle, or
as lnterfeimg m the slightest degree with oui po
litioal lelations      We, Mr   di 1  not regard it as a
point foi  a r ew departure, or foi  commencing a
ntw nolitical ieck( un g     How it may have been
viewed  by the Scnat i   fiom Virginia, aid  his
friend fiom New York, is not for u e to say
At the next se-,sion, m 1837, we reached the
third stage m the Senator's financial news, as dis-
closed in what was called hit. curiency bill, aid
his management of tnat bill befoie the Senate
1 he bill in itself was well enough it only recnacted
the jomt resolution ot 1816, with a provision de
signed to restrain and regulate the issues oí the
State banks At that time this had, 'o a limited
extent, been the policy of the Administration, I
had not much confidence in it, but was willing to
give it a fair trial I voted for the bill, and am by
no means sure now, that if we cannot establish
the Independent Treasury, it would be wise to
adopt that bill, which, in its practical opeiation,
in one or two yearb from this time, I think in
1840, would entirely exclude all bank paper from
your revenue foi there is not now, and will not
then be, any lanks thet do not issue no'es less
than twenty doláis This, however, I do not
suijose was the gentleman's object At that
pei tod the idea of lestrictmg and legulating the
( Kruicy, by the rtg ilationa and influence of the
revenu , v.a  a proa inent and distitct feature m
the Senator's financial policy He designed to
restiain and control the currency of the States by
the Federal revenue, and thus to effect, indirectly,
what he admitted we have no power to do directly
In the undue importance attached to this meas-
ure, and the management of the bill when before
the Senate, some gentlemen supposed at the time
that they discovered political designs, an opinion
that subsequent events appear by no means to
have weakened
I now, sir, come to the extra session, when the
Senator's financial views appear to have under
gone no essential change He proposed his cur-
rency bill as a substitute for the bill reported by
the Senator from New York, [Mr Wright,]
without any change, except a provision designed
to stimulate the banks to resume-specie payments
At the last session an important change appeals
to have taken place in the financial policy of our
future head of the Treasury. The principle of
controlling the State bank currency, simply by
the management and influence of the Federal reve-
nues, was abandoned,and we were presented with
a most gigantic and splendid scheme of a league
of State banks, to be connected with the Treasury,
and under the direction of the Secretary Of all
the piojects for conducting the finances, this, in my
judgment, was the most dangerous and alarming
The plan was, to recharter and take into the ser
vice of the United States twenty five of the largest
and most respectable of the State corporations, to
give them the entire monopoly of the revenue, to
authorize them to supply a Federal cuirency to
be received for the public dues, and to circulate
throughout the Union, and to clothe them with
power to regulate and control the entire currency
of the country, under the supervision and direc
Hon of the Secretary of the Treasury This was
a combined engine of a national bank and a
Treasury bank, of the worst and most dangerous
character The combined power of these twenty-
live large banks, with the revenue and credit of
the Government, acting under the direction and
control of the Secretary of the Treasury, with
authority to coeice and tegulate the other State
bankb, would have been a centralization ot the
moneyed power, and a union of that power with
the Government, in a form of all others the most
dangerous
It is scarcely possible for the imagination to
conce ve of an engine more formidable or more
dangerous than this It would have had the pos-
sesion and control of the public revenue, of pub-
lic ciedit.and, to a great extent, of the general
currency and credit of the country What is a
centialized authority over the entire currency and
credit oí the Union but a power over commeice,
manufactures, over impoits and eKports, over the
public revenue, and the entire business of the
country > And what is a control of the business
of tht country but a power over the politics of the
country' But it is not my purpose to examine
this bplendid scheme of centialized moneyed power
united with the Government I expressed my
views of it at the time, and I hove now only
alluded to it as one of the many wise financial
schemes of the future Secretary of the Treasury,
in case the combined forces oí the Opposition
should succeed—an event which, v, hen viewed in
connection wuh a scheme like this, oi a national
bank, I am lejoiced to say, is not very piobable
It is the authoi of this scheme who is so con
stantly filled with apprehension at the increase of
execu'ive power, and the coriupting and danger
ous influence of the public revenues
Mr President, I have come down to the pres-
ent ti tie, and what is to be the great financial
scheme of the honoiable Senator, at the present
session, it is pel haps too early to determine So
far as an opinion can be denved from the speech
on which I have had occasion to comment, nearly
one third of wh ch is devoted to the general ques
tion, the Ceoatoi seems now to be m favor of the
deposit system, solely on the ground of its beirg
the most safe and coniement, and without tegard
to its incidental power, to which he once attached
so muc i importance,or íestram ngand legulating
the eeneial paper curiency In urging its supe
nority over the Independent Tieasuiy plan, he
¡eheb on these two considerations alone
In regard to the question whether the Independ-
ent Treasury or the State bank-deposit system is
most safe for the public revenue, it has been fully
discussed heretofore, and I am not disposed now
to go into it Nothing, perhaps, can be added on
either side to what has been already said; and Í
will only remark that the arguments which have
heretofore been urged on our side have not in the
least degree been weakened by any defalcations or
other events which have occurred since this ¡sub-
ject was before the Senate at the last session, on
the contrary, they have received additional strength
and force
1 have now, sir, concluded what I had to say
In examining the financial opinions and views of
the honorable Senator from Virginia, I have en-
deavored to present them fairly, and if I have fallen
into error, it is not intentional Whether he is
disposed to do jubtice to the Administration or not,
I am desirous to do justice to him. In the notice
taken of his opinions and public acts, I really hope
I have been as candid and impartial as he has in
examining the official conduct of the Secretary of
the Treasury As in the contingency supposed,
the Senator is to be placed at the head of theTreas-
ury, I have deemed it important that the country
should know what his financial principles and pol-
icy have been at different periods, that he should
stand before the country as he has been, and ashe
now is, in h>s new position, at the head of the
" armed neutrality," now allied with the Opposi-
tion forces
I regret to have detained the Senate so long, in
a debate of this description, and thank gentlemen,
on both side3 of the House, for their attention
MILITARY ROAD IN ARKANSAS
REMARKS OF HON. A. YELL,
OF ARKANSAS,
In the Hoose or Representatives,
January 25, 1839,
On the bill reported by Mr   McKay, of North
Carolina, to amend the act of 1836, to authoi ize
the Secretary of War to continue the garrison
at Fort Gibson, and to open a Military Road
on the Western frontier, so as to pass within
the State of Arkansas, whenever the public ser-
vice may require it
After a few remarks had been submitted by Mr
Mercer, of Virginia, in reference to the geograph-
ical limitations and features of the bill,
Mr YELL rose and said, that he was sure that
the gentleman from Virginia [Mi Mercer] did
not fully understand the provisions of the bill, or
he would not oppose it The object of the bill was
to authorize the Secretary of War to do the veiy
thing which that gentleman [Mi Mercer] and
himself believed the Secretary, under theactof the
14th of May, 1836, was authorized to carry into
efftct The Secretary of War, however, had given
a different construction to the act to which the bill
befoie the House was amendatory, and he and his
friend from Virginia had united in giving to the
original bill a cordial support Theonginalact of
May 14,1836, directs that the road sha'l be opened
along the western boundary of the States of Ark-
ansas and Missouri—he did not know that he
quoted the precise words of the act, but he gave
the substance—and pass within the Indian coun-
try, if tne assent of the Indian tribes occupying
that region could be obtained The assent of the
Indians had been obtained The Secretary of War
is therefore of opinion that he will be compelled to
make the road wholly in the Indian terntoiy
The constructions given to the act, by the gentle-
man from Virginia and myself, are precisely ad-
verse I infer fiom the act of 1836, that the road
is to lun within the limits of the States of Arkansas
and Missouri, and can pass onl\ within the Indian
country, upon the conditions mentioned in the act,
by the consent of the Indians Otherwise the act
of 1836 would havt been nugakry or contingent,
depending on t-i  assent of the Indians to give i
vitality Such (Mr Y said) he was sure was not
the intention of Congress nor is a different con-
clusion a plausible inference undei the Itttei ot
the law itself    Such, however, has been the decís-
