HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, March 10, 1862-7 p. m.

Major-General MCCLELLAN, Washington:

Reserves intended to support General Curtis will now be drawn in as rapidly as possible and sent to the Tennessee. I propose going there in a few days. That is now the great strategic line of the Western campaign, and I am surprised that General Buell should hesitate to re-enforce me. He was too late at fort Donelson, as Hunter has been in Arkansas. I am obliged to make my calculations independent of both. Believe me, general, you make a serious mistake in having three independent commands in the West. There never will and never can be any co-operation at the critical moment; all military history proves it. You will regret your decision against me on this point. Your friendship for individuals has influenced your judgment. Be it so. I shall soon fight a great battle on the Tennessee, unsupported, as it seems, but if successful, it will settle the campaign in the West.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

Pope calling loudly for siege guns, which I am just ready to send as I received your telegram to send them up Tennessee. Telegraph immediately whether to send them to New Madrid or Tennessee.

Brigadier-General CULLUM, Cairo, Ill.:

Send all siege guns to Pope he wants. I understand you have six-enough for both lines. Why can't Commodore Foote move to-morrow? It is all-important. By delay he spoils all my plans. Persuade him to go see Scott, and have him assist you.

Major-General HALLECK:

Dispatch from Pope just in. Persistent efforts of gunboats to dislodge Plummer, but don't succeed. Has lodgment in rifle pits at Point Pleasant for his four guns and thousand men. Immense quantity of supplies fell into Plummer's hands. Transport mashed by gunboat passed Point Pleasant yesterday. Reliable information that 16,000 coming from Memphis to re-enforce Island Numbers 10. Enemy established two heavy guns opposite, but Pope thinks Plummer cannot to be dislodged by them and 16,000 men. If possible will send siege artillery to-morrow, without waiting for horses and harness. Can't coax Foote to stir with gunboats before Wednesday.

G. W. CULLUM.
