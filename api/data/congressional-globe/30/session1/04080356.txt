THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 15,
tamed by the public records of this Government,
known and read of all men.
With a perfect knowledge of these facts, (for we
cannot suppose the President ignorant of his coun-
try's history,) the Executive ordered our army
into a territory to which we had no just title—a
territory in possession of a nation with which we
were at peace; and there our forces, under the di-
rection of the President, committed overt acts of
war, by blockading the Rio Grande and charging
the Mexican lines, before they had fired a gun or
obstructed the movement of our army by force.
Although the design of this war was at first con-
cealed from the American people, the late avowals
of the President and his friends leave no doubt of
its object. It was commenced and is prosecuted
for the unholy purpose of conquest. 1 will not
enlarge upon this point. A bare statement of the
case is sufficient to show its injustice, to crown its
authors with infamy, and create serious ajarm in
the breast of every friend of our free institutions.
But I will not pursue this branch of the subject.
Passing over the causes-of the war, and the unholy
object for which it is prosecuted, I wish to call the
attention of the committee to the financial embar-
rassment in which it has involved us.
At the commencement of the war our finances
were in the most prosperous condition, there being
a surplus of ten millions of dollars in the treasury.
And now, after the war has been prosecuted some
twenty months, we are on the verge of bankruptcy.
We have consumed the ordinary revenue, ex-
hausted the ten millions surplus, together with a
loan or treasury notes of thirty-three millions, and
are now called upon for a grant of sixteen millions
more, to supply the wants of the Government
during the present fiscal year*, and this sum, I am
persuaded, will be found too small by. eight or ten
millions, as 1 shall endeavor to show hereafter.
So that, when the war shall have continued twen-
ty-five months, we shall have expended, in addi-
tion to the accruing revenue, some sixty-eight
millions of dollars. This is but a part of the bur-
] of the army, including volunteers, have, during
the year ending June 30, 1847, exceeded the peace
establishment of the year ending June 30, 1845,
$30,727,041; and for the present fiscal year the ex-
penditure will be much greater. I am aware that
the Secretary of War estimates the cost of the
army for the present fiscal year^at $27,798,448,
being more than §6,000,000 less 'than it was last
year; and I am also aware that these estimates are
entitled to very little consideration. The Secre-
tary last year estimated the cost of the army at
$27,733,096, which was §6,148,972 less than the
actual cost. And how was this? What occa-
sioned this increase of expenditure over the esti-
mates which were made when the year had nearly
half passed away? The Secretary would probably
tell you that the President during the last half of
the year called out more volunteers than had been
anticipated, and that Congress created ten new
regiments after the estimates were submitted, and
that these were the causes o? the increased ex-
I penditures. I admit that this new force would
sv/allow up the extra $6,000,000; but still, with
this increased force, the honorable Secretary
comes forward, at the commencement of this
Congress, with an estimate for the army for only
$27,798,448, being but §65,352 more than the esti-
mate of last year, when it was too small by
$6,148,972. The ten regiments which were created,
and the additional volunteers called out, could not
have served more than six and most of them did
not serve more than two or three months: and if
this carried the expenditures from the $27,733,096
estimated up to $33,882,068,1 cannot conceive how
this increased force called into service during the
war, and consequently serving during the whole of
the present year, can be suppoited for $6,000,000
less than they were last year, when they served but
a short time. Besides, we have already been in-
formed by the Executive Department (see Execu-
tive document No. 2, and miscellaneous document
No. 14, published by order of this House) that the
appropriations of the last winter for the present
dens brought upon us by this unnecessary war. p fiscal year for the army were $14,014,635 too small,
Our munitions of war, which have been accumu- ;! and that this additional sum must be provided for,

lating for years m our arsenals, some fifteen mil-
lions of dollars worth of our public domain given,
or to be given, in bounty to our soldiers, and long
lists of pensions and private claims growing out of
the war—these should be taken into the account,
and wiil go far in increasing the sum. These are
some of the pecuniary burdens which a weak and
wicked Administration have wantonly biought
upon the people.
War is necessarily expensive, and is almost
another name for oppressive taxation. And I re-
joice that it is so. It bears the stamp of a prevent-
ive Providence, and is calculated to awaken the
people to a sense of their condition, and to induce
a strict scrutiny into the conduct of their rulers.
I am glad that this war has involved the Govern-
ment in financial embarrassment, because the bur-
dens of taxation may reach the grand sensorium
of some men who, mad with ambition and drunk
with the idea of acquisition, seem insensible to the
calls of justice and the pleadings of humanity. And
i venture to predict, that if the party now in pow-
er—the criminal authors of the war—had the man-
liness to come forward and impose taxes sufficient
to support the war, and sustain the credit of the
Government, the people would rise in the majesty
of their strength, and hurl indignantly from power
those who have abused the trust which a confiding
people have reposed in them.
It is, Mr. Chairman, from a view of the docu-
ments which have been submitted, impossible even
to approximate the amount which has been wan-
tonly wasted in this war of aggression and con-
quest. The reports of the Secretary of the Treas-
ury are so obscure, and his accounts are so con-
fused, that it is difficult to understand them. There
are some items, however, which are perfectly in-
telligible; and to these I wish to call the attention
of the committee. 1 allude to the army expendi-
tures; and when I speak of these, I do not include
the whole military establishment, but leave out of
the account the armories, arsenals, fortifications,
Military Academy, and that part of the civil ser-
vice which relates to the War Department.
The expenditures for the army alone, during the yearendinfi
June, 1845, were $3,155 027
During the year ending June 30,1846   7,454,577
During the year ending June 30, 3847 33,882."""
And yet with these facts staring him in the face,
the Secretary presents us with an estimate for the
! army this yearlees by £6,083,620 than theascertain-
! ed expenses for the last year. Nothing short of a
J disposition to conceal the real state of the treasury,
! can account for estimates like these. By a report
; of the Adjutant General, submitted with the Presi-
| dent's message at the last session, it appeared that
i the army in the field in Mexico amounted at
, that time to 24,984; and by his report submitted
I with the message this year, it appears that the army
1 in the field in Jtlexico amounts to 43,536; a fact
which will justify the conclusion, that instead of
the expense of the army being $6,000,000 less than
it was last year, it will probably be $6,000,000
more; showing the estimate to be $12,000,000 less
than the probable expenditures.
Thus far, Mr. Chairman, I have confined myself
j to the expenditures of the army alone; but if we
I look at the whole expenditures of the Government,
I we shall come to the same result, viz: that the es-
! timates are not at all reliable, being far below the
I actual expense. The ascei tained expenditures of
t the last year are set down by Mr. Walker at
! $59,451,177; while the estimate for the present
| year is $58,615,660; being $835,517 less than the
I actual expenditures of last year. The improbabil-
] ity of this result wiil appear from the facts already
i stated. We have already seen that the army in
the field the present year is eighteen thousand five
hundred rank and file greater than it was last year;
and there are now vacancies amounting to more
than fifteen thousand in the regular and volunteer
forces, which the President is authorized to fill,
and which he is now filling with all possible de-
spatch. The Executive has informed us that they
have already ascertained deficiencies in the differ-
ent departments, in the appropriations of the last
session for the present fiscal year of $14,229,844.
From every view we can take of the subject, I am
satisfied that the estimates are from eight to ten
millions too low. It is difficult and even impossi-
ble to estimate the expenses of the campaign with
perfect accuracy, but we have data before us suffi-
cient to show that the estimates of the departments
are not at all reliable. Though the Secretai
 y of
the Treasury estimates the total expenditure for
u • , ij year 1848 at $58,615,114, I have no doubt but
ttere we perceive at once that the expenditures [j that we may add $8,500,000 to this estimate with
perfect safety, bringing the total expenditures of
the year up to $67,100,000. On the other hand, I
am satisfied that the Secretary of the Treasury has
over-estimated his receipts. He sets down his
means for the year ending June 30,1848, as fol-
lows, viz:
Customs   $31,000,000
Public lands  3,500,000
Miscellaneous sources .  400,000
§■34,900,000
No man, as it seems to mr, can examine 4hese
estimated receipts without being satisfied that they
are exaggerated. If we compare them with the
receipts of preceding years, or if we inquire into
the amount of imports, we must perceive at once
that the receipt of $31,000,000 from customs is
out of the question. To obtain that revenue, we
must import, for home consumption, goods, wares,
and merchandise, to the amount of $380,840,021;
which would be $66,806,632 more than the aver-
age of the four preceding years. The average
consumption of imports for the years 1844, 1845,
and 1846, was $103,067,692; the consumption for
the year 1847 was $138,534,480; being $35,466,788
more than the average of the three preceding years.
Seeing the imports for domestic consumption for
the last year were $35,466,000 above the former
average, I am satisfied that the people cannot, in
their present embarrassed condition, pav for an im-
port of $180,840,021; which would be §42,305,541
more than was purchased last year, and $77,772,329
more than the average of 1844, 1845, and 1846.
And yet this enormous importation must be made
in order to give Mr. Walker his $31,000,000 of
revenue from customs. The principal reason why
our imports were so large last year, was the fam-
ine in Europe, which enabled us to send abroad
$41,000,000 of breadstuff's and provisions more
than during the preceding year: but that cause has
now passed away; and to infer that we can import
$77,772,000 more than the average of 1844, 1845,
and 1846, now that the famine has ceased, because
we imported $35,466,000 more than that average
while the famine existed, shows a love of the mar-
velous hardly consistent with financial calculations.
I believe that the revenue from customs cannot
with any propriety be estimated above $26,500,000
for the year 1848; and to obtain that revenue, we
must import for home consumption $154,059,861;
which is more than $15,525,000 above the imports
of last year, and more than the country can sup-
port. In estimating the revenue for the present
year, I have taken the last year's imports and
levenue as the basis, though that basis is altogether
too favorable to the Secretary. Five-twelfths of
the last year was under the tariff of 1842, where
the rates of duty were from five to ten per cent,
higher than under the present tariff. So that, to
realize the $31,000,000 estimated by the Secretary,
we must in fact import a larger amount than I
have stated; and the $26,500,000 which I have set
down as the amount to be received would in fact
require an import of more than the $154,059,000
already stated. But, as I wish to be upon the safe
side, I have chosen to adopt the ratio of the last
year. If I am correct in my positions, $4,500,000
must be stricken from Mr. Walker's revenue from
customs.
He estimates the revenue from the public lands
at$3,500,000, which I believe is at least^l,500,000
more than can be realized from that source. The
average income from the lands for the last three
years has been $2,423,276, and there are causes
which must operate unfavorably upon that branch
of the revenue. By the act of February 11,1847,
it was provided that all soldiers who have served
twelve months in the Mexican war, or have been
killed in battle, or have been discharged in conse-
quence of sickness incurred in the service, shall
receive one hundred and sixty acres of land, or
scrip to the amount of one hundred dollars. Some
twenty-five thousand of these soldiers have been
discharged, and these land warrants are being is-
sued in large numbers, and these warrants will
absorb a large quantity of the public lands, and so
divert the proceeds of the sales from the treasury.
If I am right in these calculations, the balance-
sheet at the end of the year will be materially af-
fected. The case would then stand thus :
