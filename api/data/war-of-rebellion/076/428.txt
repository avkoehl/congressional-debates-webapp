(Received 2.50 p.m.)

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I have sent the Ninth Illinois Cavalry* down on our right flank to watch the movements of the enemy and guard against any attempt to get in our rear.

O. O. HOWARD,

Tell me of what service I can be to you.

HOWARD'S HEADQUARTERS, August 8, 1864.

General SHERMAN:

I have ordered what little reserve I have to be held in hand on the Green's Ferry road. I will go to General Schofield's headquarters. Please communicate with me there, if there are any orders.

Major-General HOWARD:

There is a wooded hill to General Corse's left and front, on which I was told General Williams' skirmishers were yesterday. It seemed to be on the south of Proctor's Creek.

General HOWARD:

General Schofield reports his line close up to the rebel lines from your right to the crossing of the south fork to Utoy, which he thinks is one mile from East Point; the thinks he sees the railroad but if so, it is the West Point railroad, which is not the one we want. His line gives General Hascall's division in excess, one brigade of which is across Utoy and on the ridge which he is fortifying.
