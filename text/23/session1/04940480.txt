others that call for immediate action, that 1 have
not been able to give to it the full consideration

the opinions I entertain as to the power of this
Government on subjects of this description, but
my respect for the decision of the two Houses of
Congress, and for the large body of my fellow-
cuizens who are interested in this improvement,
induces me to hold the bill for the present, that I
may, during the period allowed to me by the Con-

no further communications to make during the
present session "
