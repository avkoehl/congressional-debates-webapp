stull not a.--'* an explanation to satisfy my own mind as to their
inco i is^ncy, 1 will only call the gentlernan'aattention to them,
that .vhenhe wntesouthlsepeech foi his constituents he may
bo shape them as to avoid the charge, lest, otherwise, when he
shall mak<> a "stump pp ecia," he may he asked for explana-
tion at a^ntical time by aoma troublesome constituent.
That the gentleman and his party have changed their views
upon this q lestionr since their relation to the Government
has been changed, it true In 1833, when thev wielde 1
the sceptre of power in Georgia, their principles were wholly
the reverse of what they are now They did not then assei t
ttm the o le to the public lands waa derived from the Constitu-
tion, but, on the contrary, affirmed that it sprung fiom the deeds
of cession 1 he following extract from the resolutions of the
tzeoi eia Legislature, at the time I have referred to, when the
Demociatic party had an oveiwhelmtng majority in both
tranche5!, will show something of these opinions
"Without speeilcally inquiring into the means by which the
United States Government became possessed ot the public
iaruk, or the causes which, after the war of the Revolution, in-
duced several of the ¡Mates to transfer to that Governmental!,
or a great por'ion, of their unoccupied landa, under certain
limitations and lestnciions specified in the several deeds of ces-
sion or relinquishment, your committee deem it sufficient to
state that those deeds and relinquishments, and all other pur-
chases of lands by the United States Government, w era made
for the common benefit of the several Stat™, that it is a com-
mortfund, to be distributed without partiality, and to inure to
the equal benefit of oil the States "
These resolutions woie passed with great unanimity, and, if
I mistake not, met tvith little or no opposition fiom eiiher pany
They differ totally from the present opinions of the party which
txpiessedthem They not only declare that the lands ceded
weie ceded in trust for the benefit of all the States, but that
those ptiichased by the Government were subject to the same
trust, and that the whole constitute a fund to be "distnbuted
without partiality "
The Legislature went on to declare that thty could rot' per
ceive that the Land bill introduced into the Senate of the United
States by Mr C iy, and passed by that bndy, provides lor the
distribution o( the public landsm that equitable manur con
templated by the States in their several deeds of cession," and
theiefore instructed tneir Senators and lequested their llepre
s*ntMi es to oppose it e passage of a bill havmz for us object
such a distubu ion How far these instructions and request
may be considered as applying to any other than the present
Congiev'., 1 *hall not stop to inquire The fact that seveial Le
gis aturos have convened since the land question agitated
throughout the Union during the time, and no subsequent opi
nion expressed by the Legislature, as I am aware, would argue
an abandonment of the instiuctions and requests, and an ac-
quiescence m the detail? of the bill But whatever may be the
opinions of othors, I «hall conform my vote to the request, not
as imposing any thing obligatory on me, but because I believe
thtt thepresent bill "does not provide for the distribution ol the
j u K lands in that cqmtablo manner contemplated by the
•5U.'!S i.i thou several deeds of cession" With a modification
01  the o'liectiontble features, I should feel myself bound to
J'te lor the lull as a ir.attei of justice to the States, and in
f ¡I'hlinent of ne comma of the United States Gorei niiwnt with
thorn
But the gentlem m from Maine, doubting as to the ti u.li of
his potltio i, and na to the correctness of his prinunlee, his
sought to rover his letreat by assuming that, if a uuit exists,
the trustee hasa light to be rumbur^d (his expenditures for
the trust estate' out of the estate, before he can be compel
lea to eurrendei u I will not controvert the posmon but
vi 11 the aro id ground autumn), for ihe sake oflhe argument
n lllu (ration md suppoit of his position, lie has exhibited
an account cuuent of the nteipts and expenditures of the
public lands, an 1 haa made an excess of expenditures over
receipts and a consequent indebtedness to the tiustee of
813,742,262.

the resei vauon had been intended to 'he Government it would
have been unnecessary to specify themselves as included, be
cause what belonged to the Government, to be u&ed for its pur-
poses would necessarily be used for the benefit of the&e States
as well as thereat
Then, I ieptfat,the only question is, to whom do these lands
belong^ If the gentleman's position be true, that the Govern-
ment t erivea title from the Constitution, and not from the deeds
of cession then is ihe argument well founded, but if these posi
tiot s are untrue, ihe whole argument mils, unsustamed by any
principle whatever.
'1 he indebtedness of the Government is no reason for the ap
plication of trust funda for us use, and the every day decisions
of our courts do not fail to hold the trustee to strict accountabi
hty for th** use of funds in bis hands, and. so far fiom pall ating
their use by reason of his indebtedness, ih?y visit him with ex
emplary damages, by filing upon him the naid exactions of
annual íests, for the appiopnation to his own use of funds
which he possesses alone by reason of his fiduciaiy character
And I would put it to the candor of the gentleman, and ask
hinij were such acasesupposable, if I were his trustee andpe
cumary embarrassments should oppress me, so that I might
find it to my interest, to escape fie sacuficeof my property, 01
to avoid the payment of ínteres', to appropriate his trust
estate to the payment of my debts, would I be lustifie 1 m law
or good faith m doing so1? If I would not be, then I would asir
by what inle of right is the ITrjitcd States j ustified m appro
puating to the payment of its debts tti,s funds it holds as trus-
tee tor the btatesi
But the Government has always denied its right to appro
priate trust funds with( ut accountability It is now trustee
foi several Indian tribes for several millions of dollars Who
will assert us right to 10b the Indians ot then money to pay the
national debt with? The Government is the trustee for the
na\ y pensioner* the trust fund has been pquandered by mis-
management Who will dare assert that no obligation exists
to account for that fund? The Government adnm s its liabi vy,
and at the Hst session appropriated tl"0 000to meet chirsis
upon it; and now a part of the appropi lations asked for is to
pay an ad luional charge upon that fund Here is the solemn
actofthr Government, denying its iightto appropi late a trn^t
fund, without accountability, to its own use And if such exact
induce 1*1 meted out to Indian tribes and navy pensioners I a=¡k
by what authority do you feel at liberty to disregard similar
claims of the sovereign States of this Confederacy? No, eir,
tV argument is falhcous the indebtedness of the Government
has nothing todo with the richtsof the States If mismanage
ment has heaped a national debt upon the Federal Government,
let that Government rely upein its own resources to pay the
debt, and let those who have wronged the country suffer for a
breach of confidence The deprivation of the States of their
rights cannot be justified by the mismanagement of the finances
of the country by those who had charge of them.
Trom the course ofthe argument it appears that if oui judg-
ments cinnot he enlightened, our fears at lea<?t shall be ■*routed
A rod is held in terror over us, that, if the proceeds of the pub-
lic lands should be turned over to the rightful owner?, the
States a deficiency will be created in the Tiea=:ui>, which
must b" supplied, eitliei by a revival of a pro ecnve tariff, or
by a tnx upon the necessaries of life, which enter into the con-
sumption of the poo , so that we are required still to continue
to h\ch the po kets of the States, or, if we recuse to do so, we
rnmt then incur the charge of oppiessiog the poor for the be
nefit of the rich.
To demonstrate the truth of his position, the "cnileman from
Mune assumes that $22,000,000 is the least posible amount
thit the G i\ eminent, nndtr dii ecotiomn al administration, can
get alon^with What motive he can hive in i«snmmg po

pirty in power will not be satisfied with such expenditure?

lieving that he has committed some sro<n eirors in the facts he

nor do I think that I would use them if I could obtain them
but I have before me a report of the Secretary of the Treasuiv'
made on the 1st Juh, 1840 which authouzesme to come to

a deficiency, we pIiiII ha^e by taxing these anieles only, an an
nual surplus of $2 751 058 to 'appiopnate to the extinguishment
of the national debt
The gentleman, a^terdeclaung that this deficit will exist in tho
Trt.asui3,goeson to sti'e that n cannot be supplied but by a tax
on tea and coffee and asks most emphatically, if any Kepie
sentauve from Mtim wi'l daietovote forany duty on these ar-
ticles I cannot answer for his colleagues what ihey dale ur
dare not do, but I on tell him that, if he isas much of an anti-
TanfT man as he would make us believe by his declarations, be
would maintun the principle that all aiticlcs impor ed should
pav an ad valorem duty \Ae of the South have ever com-
plaintd that tho tanfT laws were unequal, because they discn
rmnated so fai as to make a large ponton of the impoits duty
free, while the \esidue had to pay double dutv, to cie¿te funds
enough to earry on tl e Government To show the uuthoi our
position on this question, I will only say, that the annual «ve-
íase vrflue of imports paving duties, fiom 1834 to 1S40, is
$71,6^5 347, the annua! average value of imports dutyfree, for
the same time, exc'ud'rg bullion and specie, is $60 738,627; so
that seven thirteenths of the imports pay all tho revenues deri-
vable from that source And who, 1 ask, is there m his mo-
ment* of Cetlm lefiection, unexched by interest, will undeitake
to say that such discrimination is just? I will not say ihat uis,
criminating duties are piohibited by the Constitution, but I
will say that discrimination to such an extent >s unequal, un-
just, and unconstitutional The gentleman says that there are
many who are opposed toa protective tariff, but, lfyoufuice
the alternative between a duty (n coffee and tea andaprotec
tive tariff, they will take *h latter Now this declaration
amounts in "ubstante to thi* that so long as you place ihe du
ties on t-ueb aiticies is are not amorg those whuh they con
sume, and consequently they are thereby lelieved from payn g
any duties to the support of Government, they will denounce a
pto'ecu\e tariff but if you seek to make them contributes orre
thing tn the support of Government, they will then force a pro
teemp tariff upon you, by which they will still get what they
consume without tax. If theie is any difierence between the^e
position", I do not perceive it, both assume that these patriotic
citizens mu«it live under the Government and enjoy its protec
tion, without contributing to its support This you must do for
them peaceably, if you will, but do it you shall, at all hazards.
No, sir, the anti tanfT party, whether North or South, Eas'
or West, have ever made it a cardinal principíelo their faith
that all dut'es should, as neai as can be denem jivice to the
Government, be laid upon the ad valorem, principle No n te
íesr orpoitionof society is benefited by the admission of a^y
article duty fiee, especially necessaries, but themanufactunng
inteiest, wnetherthdt be in the North or South As the=e ne
cessanc-. are rendered cheaper by the absence of duties, so ist
the manufacturer ofany article paying duties enabled to pio-
cure his laboi cheaper, so that what is m?de on the puce of
neces arieMs lost m profits to the rranufactmei Andjiistso
