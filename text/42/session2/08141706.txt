THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March. 15,
estimated for new items of appropriation in
addition to the sum I have already given of
$273,000,000, which he says were omitted
from the estimates, but which by a careful
examination are easily explained. He says :
" In addition to the estimates for 1872-73, of
$273,000,000, the House have provided for omissions
from estimates amounting to $1,800,000; in the defi-
ciency bill, $6,200,000; for buildings at Chicago,
$4,000,000; and for several other items, making an
increase of 826.574,685."
And adding all these to the estimates of the
Secretary of the Treasury, he seemed to indi-
cate that the expenditures of the Government
next year will be $299,600,000. On a careful
analysis of this statement I find that his fears
are entirely unfounded, and the estimates
already given by me include every item of
expenditure, with bat a fevTexceptions, that
will be provided for by law. They are rather
over than under estimated. For instance ; as
the omissions from the estimates stated by him
at $1,800,000, I can find none such. The
deficiency bill he puts at $6,200,000; but that
is a deficiency for this year, not for the next
year. It does not go into the expenditures of
next year at all, and will be paid out of the
large surplus revenue of the present year.
Then he speaks of " buildings in Chicago,
$4,000,000." It is true, we may expend
$4,000,000 for buildings in Chicago ; but our
receipts have been increased more than twice
$4,000,000 by the destruction of duty-paid
goods in Chicago, and all the expenditures
that will be incurred by the United States in
the rebuilding of the buildings in Chicago is
more than counterbalanced by the gain of
duty-paid goods, which must be supplied by
the importation of others.
" Corporation tax to be refunded, 82,500.000."
In the first place, the bill for refunding has
not passed, but if it does pass it is only taking
bo much money out of the current receipts for
this year, of which there is a large surplus.
The " pensions dated back to and including
1878," estimated by him at $10,664,685. It
is enough to say that the House of Represent
atives, probably without a careful examination
of the subject, passed that bill, but I am assured
there is not the slightest probability that it will
pass the Senate, or be even reported. The
chairman of the Committee on Pensions in-
forms me that there is no probability or possi-
bility of such a bill passing at this session.
Mr. EDMUNDS, If the Senator will allow
me, I will say that I stated that to him on the
ground, and I think it was a just one, that we
have reported at this session adversely upon
probably nearly fifty cases of exacts that char-
acter, one by one, which the Senate has unani-
mously disposed of according to our reports.
Mr. SHERMAN. So I find, that of all
the items of increase to be provided for, accord-
ing to this statement there is but $1,710,000
left, and the Committee on Appropriations of
the House have already, to their credit, largely
reduced the estimates of the Secretary of the
Treasury. For instance, the fortification bill,
which is estimated at $8,219,000, passed the
House of Representatives and is peiuhng
here, without amendment, at $1,985,000. The
appropriations for public works, instead of
being $19,468,000, I am told in the single
item of the appropriations for rivers and har-
bors the estimates will be reduced about six
million dollars, and there is .scarcely possi-
bility, certainly no probability, that Congress
â€¢with authorize, all told, for public buildings,
the amount estimated by the Secretary of the
Treasury, $19,468,000. It is probable that
certain public buildings will be erected instead
of other improvements, but it is not possible
that the amount estimated for in the annual
estimates will be expended for that purpose.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. If the Sena-
tor will allow me, I will state that the Com-
mittee on Public Buildings and Grounds have
reported bills that amount to $3,050,000 of
expenditure this year, but nearly all that is
absorbed by Chicago and St. Louis, leaving
but $550,000 thus far appropriated for all the
other portions of the country, and the whole
amount authorized is $7,900,000, and taking
out these two places to $1,650,000, when the
buildings shall be entirely completed.
Mr. SHERMAN. The whole amount esti-
mated by the Secretary of the Treasury for
public buildings is $19,468,562, and there is
no approach to this estimate of the Secretary
by any bills that are now pending in Congress
for public works.
I assume, then, upon the estimate of the
Secretary of the Treasury, that the sum of
$273,025,773 99 will be required to meet the
interest of the public- debt, the pension list,
and the other proper expenditures of the Gov-
ernment. To this must be added such further
sum as by a wise public policy ought to be
applied to the reduction of the public debt. So
much of this sum as is set apart under the act
of February, 1862, and July 14,1870, as a sink-
ing fund, is not open to discussion. This fund
consists of two items, to wit: one per cent, of
the aggregate debt, or $22,895,930, and the
interest upon the capital of the sinking fund,
which next year will be $5,783,383, or an
aggregate of $28,679,263. This sum, increas-
ing year by year, is specifically pledged to the
reduction of the debt, and its regular payment
is as much a part of the public obligation as
the payment of the interest of the debt.
Whether a greater sum shall be applied to
the reduction of the debt is purely a question
of public policy. There is not now the same
motive for a rapid extinction of the debt as
formerly. Since the close of the war we were
paying interest at the rate of seven and three
tenths per cent. We could sell our six per
cent, bonds only at a large discount in coin.
We had a vast unliquidated floating debt
which it was clearly the public policy to pay
off rather than to swell the funded debt. Even
our liquidated debt was largely in demand, or
other short-time liabilities. Our currency was
so far depreciated as to affect the public credit
in all the money markets of the world. Since
the close of the war the change is wonderful.
Since the commencement of General Grant's
administration the improvement of our finan-
cial condition is unexampled. We can borrow
readily at five per cent., and are now negotiat-
ing for a still lower rate. All our six percent,
bonds, including the great mass of our indebt-
edness, are above par in gold, and await our
pleasure as to the time of payment. The
floating debt is all paid except that which is
litigated and disputed. All our demand lia-
bilities are paid except a balance of the three
per cent, certificates, which are being grad-
ually paid.
Our currency approximates the specie stand-
ard and the Government is strong enough to
resume at any moment, the time being only a
question of domestic policy as it affects debtor
and creditor, producer and consumer. The
banking system is so generally distributed that
it furnishes a uniform currency and only awaits
the mandate of the Government to maintain
it at, par with gold and silver.
Every element which forms the basis of pub-
lic credit, our strength, our resources, and our
fidelity to public engagements has been dem-
onstrated. No unnatural strain upon our
resources is now necessary to enable us to ful-
fill our public engagements, to resume specie
payments, or to rapidly fund our debt at lower
interest. But we have a traditional national
policy, uniformly maintained in time of peace,
founded upon good reasons and supported by
the advice of all the eminent statesmen of our
country, that provision ought to be made that
will, if not interrupted by war, pay off the
public debt within the life of a single genera-
tion or about thirty years. This we can now
easily do and yet at each Congress repeal and
reduce taxes.
The Committee on Finance concluded that
$50,000,000, including the sinking fund pro-
vided by law, should be applied to the reduc-
tion of the debt, and that this sum added to
the $273,025,773 99, or the sum of $323,025,-
773 99, should be the basis of our revenue
reduction.
In estimating the revenue for the next fiscal
year, especially from customs duties, we have
several elements of uncertainty. Internal rev-
enue based upon consumption and customs
duties on such articles as tea, sugar, and cof-
fee, may be computed with reasonable cer-
tainty, but the results of any rate of duty on
the great body of textile and metallic fab-
rics are proverbially uncertain. An overflow-
ing Treasury being itself evidence of excess-
ive importations, may cause within a single
year a deficiency of revenue. This can only
be guessed at by a careful study of trade, and
the most sagacious merchants sometimes wreck
their fortunes by a mistake in this matter.
One example I remember very well. In
March, 1857, we were legislating to reduce
the revenue because we had such an over-
whelming Treasury. My honorable friend
from Vermont, [Mr. Mourill,] then, like my-
self, a member of the other House, said he
would vote for almost any bill that would
reduce taxes, in order to get rid of the sur-
plus revenue. At the very next session we
were met with a deficiency, and we were com-
pelled to borrow money from the very begin-
ning, caused by the revulsion of 1857, which
paralyzed all trade, the revenues of the coun-
try being then derived entirely from imported
goods.
A long period of time shows, as a general
result, an annual increase of revenue from the
same taxes of about four per cent, per annum.
This increase has been less subject to violent
changes with our paper currency than with
specie payments.
Again, the effect of the repeal and reduction
of taxes has always been overestimated. The
decrease of a tax rarely produces a correspond-
ing decrease of the revenue ; in some cases
causing an increased importation of the foreign
fabric and a falling off in the domestic fabric ;
in some cases causing an increased consump-
tion of the article. Since the 1st day of July,
1867, to this time, the receipts from customs
have gradually risen, a,s follows:
In the fiscal year 18G8 8164,464,509 56
In the fiscal year 1869  180,048,426 63
In the liMjal year 1870  194,538,374 44
In the fiscal year 1871  206,270,408 05
or an annual increase of over ten millions;
and yet, during this period, customs duties were
repealed which yielded $20,000,000 per annum.
It is now apparent that the customs duties for
the current year will largely exceed those for
last year, and there is no apparent reason that
this increase will not continue during the next
fiscal year. The receipts from customs from
the 1st day of July, 1871, to the 1st day of
March, 1872, a period of eight months, are
$146,721,000, If they continue at the same
rate for the residue of the fiscal year, the aggre-
gate receipts will be $220,001,500.
Four months ago the Secretary of the Treas-
ury estimated the receipts from customs for
next year at $212,000,000 ; but upon the basis
of existing law we may fairly estimate them
at $226,000,000.
The internal revenue for the next fiscal
year upon the basis of existing law is esti-
mated at $119,500,000, as follows:
Spirits  850,000,000
Tobacco  36,000,000
Fermented liquors.    8,500.000
Banks and bankers  5,000,000
Gas  3,200,000
Adhesive sLamps  -16,000,000
Penalties  500,000
Articles and occupations formerly taxed
but now exempt  300,000
Total $119,500,000
This estimate does not include the residuum
of the income tax on personal incomes for
1871, a part of which will come into the Treas-
ury during the next fiscal year, and will make
good fully the estimate of the Secretary of the
