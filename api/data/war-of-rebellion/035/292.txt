WASHINGTON, D. C., April 29, 1863.

If you have any available troops that can be temporarily detached to assist General Schenck, throw them into Parkersburg and Wheeling. I do not mean that you shall withdraw troops from Kentucky.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have ordered all the troops that can possibly be spared from the different camps, and have made an arrangement with the naval authorities here to send two gunboats, one from this place, which leaves to-night, and one from Cairo.

Generals Morgan and Wheeler are in the vicinity of Gainesborough. Pegram is near at hand. It is said that Maney's brigade, from Vicksburg, has reached Knoxville.

CINCINNATI, April 29, 1863-9.20 p.m.

General BOYLE:

Colonel Graham's movements are very satisfactory. Let him remain in the neighborhood of Tompkinsville, but look out that he is not caught. Order Morrison's entire brigade to Glasgow at once. Use your judgment about the route. If you conclude to send them by railroad from Lebanon it will be well to order the cars for them down to-night. I dont' know exactly where they are.
