for from this State. They cannot go into camp until tents are provided, and there is almost nothing else ready. We shall be obliged to provide local quarters and subsistence for the companies till proper provisions are made. What shall we do? Answer.

E. SALOMON,

Governor of Wisconsin.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., August 15, 1862 - 5.26 p. m.

Governor SALOMON,

Madison, Wis.:

If you will carefully read the new orders, you will hardly fail to understand that all persons volunteering to this date will be entitled to the advance pay and bounty; that volunteers for regiments partly organized and not filled up will be also entitled to pay and bounty until the 22nd of this month; that volunteers for old regiments now in the field will be entitled to pay and bounty until the 1st of September. In no other cases will bounty be paid. The meaning of the orders cannot be expressed more clearly. When you report what number of volunteers you have, instructions will be given upon the other matters mentioned in your telegram of this date.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., August 15, 1862 - 5.34 p. m.

His Excellency W. SALOMON,

Governor of Wisconsin, Madison:

Arms for the twelve regiments have been provided; 4,500 Enfield rifle muskets of superior quality have been forwarded to-day from New York. Canvas cannot be had for tents, owing to the scarcity of cotton, and you must do as you propose - build temporary board barracks.

P. H. WATSON,

Assistant Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., August 15, 1862 - 5.50 p. m.

Governor SALOMON,

Madison, Wis.:

The Department would gladly furnish experienced officers for the new recruits. But a moment's reflection will convince you that it would be grossly unjust to soldiers who are in face of the enemy to deprive them of their officers, and that it is dangerous to the country to reduce the force before the enemy. The order of the Department is a military necessity that cannot be overcome. In respect to fire companies you need have no trouble. The law of Congress exempts all who are exempted by the State law. But that can only be taken advantage of by those who were exempted at the date of the President's call. All who have joined fire companies since that date remain liable to military duty, and cannot evade it by joining a fire company.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
