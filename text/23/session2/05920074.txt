whether this contioveisy was to be settled, and
in what  mannei      It wis due to the Stiisof

I ought to have too much respect foi the n&hts of

I as a member of Massachusetts which State, fi on

thatapiecedentforthis call, made 11 this mannei,
cannot be found in the whole «gH itivc history of
this countiy and I again wirn the teal fuends of
State lights how they countenance it It is dc-
íogatoiy toeveiy membei of both Houses of Con-
giess fiom Maine, because it vntually picnmes
that they aic f ngetful of her honoi and mteiest
Mi LljNCOLN disavowed any in ention of
arraigning M"ine, or of inteifciing in any way
with hei 1 onoi oi inteiest
Mi PARKS I am well awaie, Mr Speaker,
that the honoiablt gentle man expiessly disavows
any such intent, and I am not the It ss awaie, sir,
that such is tin mfi once that must bo diawn
fiom the lesolution, viz tint the members from
Mime aie deichct to hei honoi md inteiests, and
that they have to take wing and lodge thcmsi Ives
undei the piotect,ng and fostering care of Massa-
chusetts The gentleman says " Would to God
I could sjieak foi Maine on this flooi '" Mi
Speakei, I well know that Massachus tts has a
stiong di sue to take the benighted ptopk of Man e
undei hei caie and p ot"ction, and  hat nothing
p.events but the mdiffaence of the people them
selves to piofit by so high an /«me  1 shou'd
have thoua it, sn, but foi the rosoli tion of yes-
teiday, that the people of the State which the
gentleman lcpiesents must, by this time, have
leaiiieel, by the fiequcnt lcjection of then kinl
offices,and moie jiaiti ulaily by the ev nts if the
last sunimei, that the people of Mamo considei
themselves as of age, and abundantly capable of
fnmi g their own ojimions on publn mitteis,
piotccung their own vigl ts and honoi, and st
curing hei own best inteiests The gentliman
says the honoi of Mune is not m his hands
Tiue, sn, it is not It is hete in the hands of her
Stmtois and Ptopiesentatives and when they
shall piovt licieint to, or insufficient for, the
task confided to them, she will iocill them, and
eithei send others bettei fitted foi the tiust, oi
peihapi call on the geutkn an fiom Massachusetts
foi aid
Mi Speal ei, I agun repeat that I do not op-
pos the pausan of this lesolution because I fear
th it any developments tint might Lcmae'e would
eompiomit the honoi of my State I believe it is
' al ove feai and ibove lepioach," if not, then
let hei suffi i foi it But, sn, I oppose it as setting
a piecedentinjunous, is I b h ve, to State n&hts,
and as being an unauthorized mteifeience m die
affairs existing betwi en one of the sovereign
States of this Union and thtG ner il Government,
which will tend suonsrly, to say the ¡east, to de-
stioyali thatpaihamentaiy com tesy which ought
evei to exist on thjs floor between the R present-
antes of the people of different independent com-
munities
Mi LVANS was ignoiant of the intention of
the gentleman fiom MissachusettsfMr Li^coi v]
j to offei the lesolution uiid"i coi sideration He
contended that the motion was not only propel,
but necessaiy That infoimation was requisi e
to enable mcmbeis from the State of Maine to aet
a id vote undi istandingly on this lmpoitant s-ub
Ijcct Massachusetts (he said) was no volunteer
in the mattei, hei aid had been asked by a special
mission fiom the State ot Mame, and even if it
weie not so any mem) er on that floor, let him
come fiom whit State he might, had a right to
ask foi the infoimation requntd Maine had in-
variably looked to  the   aid of Massachusetts in
I the piogiess of this contioversy She had not
looked in vain, and she had always felt giateful
to that State for the coopei ation and suppoi t which
she had leceived fiom that quarter This was
the first tune that he had evei heaiel Massachu
setts repio tolled foi hei deteimination to stand
by Maine in this contest
Mi PARKS cxpl uned Pie did not reproach
Massachusetts because she had consented to stand
by Mame in this controversy But he did not
thank Massaclmsi tts for coming forwud here
with a piopisitioti on this subject, without eon
suiting Maine or any one of liti membeis on this
flooi
