MAJOR: An intelligent negro who had been taken prisoner from us, and since been employed as a waiter to a captain of the Seventh Virginia Cavalry, arrived here this morning from Berryville. He left there last night. There is one regiment of cavalry and four pieces of artillery between here and Berryville; at and near Berryville, the Second, Third, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and Twelfth Virginia Cavalry; no infantry up to last night; a wagon train of 100 wagons at the junction of the Berryville appears to be the same as yesterday.

I send a note containing other information received from same source.

Your obedient servant,

CHARLESTOWN, October [17], 1862.

I have it from reliable authority, I think, that the enemy are in force at Winchester and Bunker Hill. My informant, a good Union man, certified to by Colonel Miles, a Northern man, says they are sending their wagons here every day and taking all the flour and wheat they can find in the country. They are destroying the railroad between here and Winchester. They were expected here to-day for the same purpose. He says there are from 800 to 1,000 cavalry about here and five guns. They have an encampment of cavalry several regiments 3 miles from here on the Berryville road. This gentleman says there is a very large force between Bunker Hill and Winchester, although he says he thinks they are "packing up," preparatory to a move. This gentleman says he is certain that the enemy were at Winchester yesterday.
