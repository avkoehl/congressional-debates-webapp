[Mr Thohpso n here was desirous of obtaining the floor for
an explana ion, but what he ^id coujd not be distinctly heard
Mr Adams    I say that it is true, I have myself seen the let
ter, and read i£
Mr Thompson- A'lere must bs some mistake, because no
part of the debt1? (aid I have examined and traced them ail) is
Sue to the people of England
Mr Adam-) I ¡>pea'i oi a letter which has been published in
all the papéis of the country it i<t si-mod with the nam* of Gov
ernor McXutt, and never -has been contradicted so far as I
know He says that he expect? the matter will be a subject
fornegotii'ien, and adds, thatagr^at majority of the people of
Mississippi would sooner go to war than yield to the payment
of the debt I cannot take the assertion of the gentleman that
there is a mistake as ¡sufficient evidence ag<uns- i document
vrhichl have seen m various papers, uncontradicted
Mr .Thompson here repeated his explanation The Gov
ernor vuuld not have expected that debts would be made the
subject of ""gouation with England, not one dollai of which
was owing "to any Bn*ish. subject)
Mt Adams Well, itisp ssibie the letter does not nane the
foieignpower with whom the negotiation is to be hell Jit
says that he expects it to become a subject of negotiation I
will not undertake to say that he actually names Great lin

Mexico co íecoveí the ten oi tivehe million  due by litr, and
the gentleman fiom Penttsy Warn i tells us that if wp will only
go to war with England, we shall atone dash sponge our whole
debt of two bundled millions Now, in lefeiente to moral
principles* I must say that I prefer the doctrine of the gentle
man fiom Vugioia I had rather, if I must go to war do it to
recover a just debt than to sponge adebt justly due I make a
deep distinction between the muial principle of the gentleman
from Virginia and the moral principle (if moral it can be
called) of the gentleman from Pennsylvania. I speak of it as a
matter of fact Both gentlemen make motives for war out of
the debts due to us or fiom us But I am now replying more
particularly to the argument of the gentleman from Virginia
I am not willing to go to wai for the recovery of the ten or the
twelve millions ol do'lars due ua by Mexico I think it not ins

my opinion weie a^ked, I should sud s iy that I piefei that some
other individual should occupy the po3t I say nothing m on
position to the eloquent pane^ync^pronounced upon the mdi
vidual my reasons are, that, upernrhe questions m controversy
between Mexico and this country, I know that his views are
such as will notbe very likely to perpetuate a state of peace
between the two cmntries, ox be very advantageous to the union
of these Stdtes, as now constituted
On a subject collateral to, if not identical with, that union, I
have had pome expeiience of the sentiment!  entertained by him,
by the gentleman fiom Virginia, and by another gentleman,
fiom Mai y land whom I do not ni wseemlmplice (supposed to

the gt ntleman in debate, I, too, ha^e ki own him on this floor
and, pethaps,the gentleman fiom Vugiria may siy of me, as
he &aid of my excellent inend from Vermont—that I also have
gi eat reason to apprec ate the gallant valor of his fuend from
South Catohna Sir, bis friend thiea'ene 1 me with the peni

acquainted with I have met him m this House, and fiom what
I have witnessed here, I should give it as my opinion that my
friend from Vermont is more thau a match for him , and I wou d
say bo to his face, it he were here Whether or not I have felt
the power of his lance, 1 leave posterity and tht. world to say
At the same time, I disclaim all feelings of unkmdness toward
the gentleman in question I mu&t say that in the private am'

ternt ry undei the standard of Texas  But I would not make
k a ground of war with Mexico, if her Government should re
ply,4 Your citizens thought proper to jom themselves with the
iorces of Texas, and have expos d themselves to even worsa
treatment than they have received " And, if they did say ao,
they might refer to the case of two British subjects by the names
of Arbmhnot and Ambrister, who once interfered in a certain
war between the United States and the Seminole Indians, carried
on not in oui own territory, but on a foreign territory In that
case, tnese men (Arnuthnot and Ambrister) were not brought to
tins city of Washington, to traverse our süee's in chains, they
were not exposed to th* severity of tiave.ling barefoot foi hun
dreds of miles fto , a course much more summary was ob-
served mtheu case, they were tried by a court martial, and
one of thorn hems a young man, scarcely of ase, the court weie
dispose)1 to let the prisoners off with a pun shment compara-
tively mild and the couit so found, but what did GeneralJack
son do 1 He struck his pen across that line in the finding of the
court, and they were both hung up I never complained of that
decision of General Tackson, though there were many others
who d-d I did not, indeed, specifically defend or support the
act, in itself eonsidered, but as a national question between us
and Spam, and between us and Great Britain, whose subjects
they were I he ground I took by the orderof my Governmert,
not so m jch to pastify the act as to put off the ground of claim
by Great Butain, was thít thefte individuals had intermeddled
in a war they had nothing to do with, in a walnut between ns
and Gieat fhitai^butbetwe^n us and certain Indian tribes;-and
that if they cho-e thus to expose tnemselves, they must abide
the consequence's It was a question of the same character as
that on wmch we are now asked to go to war I did sustain, as
a question of national law the right ol General Jacksen to tieat
them as he did and the Minister of Great Britain at that time,
Loid Castleieagh, told our All nster, Mr Iluoh, that they had
concluded to pas* it over, after many anxious consultations held
by tho British Privy Council But, he said, if I had but lifted
my finger you would havo had to answer that act of General
Jackson by war In that case there was quite as much to be
said for Great Britain had she taken up the quarrel for the
haogmg of those two British su ijects, as for us if we should go
to war for the ten or twelve citizens of the II nted States taken
m the expedition to Santa Fe I say again, if the Governmert'
has ordered our Minister to Mexicj peremptorily to demand tH
release of the American citizens now held as prisoners of war,
and, in case of refusal, to come home, as a signal of the pu
pose of this country to pursue the demand by a resort to war,
they have gone beyond what is right, and, as I believe, have gone
beyond their power
I say, fuither, that in my judgment we have adopted too
menacing atone tn oui negotiations with that power I speak
n >t, of course, with certainty, for I do not positively know, but I
do say,if our Minister has 1 een older ed to return on the condi
tion I have stated, the Givemment have transcended thoir
powei, andlsay,fui hoi, that the Executive department are nof
authoiized t> thieaun anyfoieign nation with war,becaus"
they haie no powet to procl-^n? warrand because that powei is
amoi g the most precious powers held by this and the other
House of Cirgiess, who,undei the Constitution, aie made the
trustee-, of the wai power of the nation—the most solemn trust
that cm be commuted to human hands It becomes this
House to vindicate its own au homy, and to let the JB-xt.cutive
department know that it is not for them to threaten foieigu
Governmentswith wai If a war is coming, and especially if
there is urimediatedanger of its occunence, and if the Execu
ttve is apprized oí ¡he fact, it it> his duty to inform Congress, and
especially this House, of sucn a state of things, and refer to
them the ter-ific question of authorizing war—a question in
volvjng, whenever it comes, the lives, the fortunes, and the
hap} mess of millions It instructions of the kind I have mer
tioi ed navo ^epn given I ^hsll much regre it though I shall
not be displeased that the present Mmistei shall letum

I say that I under&tooJ Lim to afirmthu if he had the power he
would pioliib¡ttljeinvi«ion of Texas by Mexico, and if Mex.tci
would notsubmit tosnch a ltrqauemeut, and should pers'st in
her invasion, he would go to war 1 he gentleman stated, as a
giound for war that Santa Anna had avowed his determination
to "drive slavery beyond the Sabine " That was what the gentle
man from Virginia most appiehended—that slaveiy would ba«
aholrahed in Texas, that we should have neighbors at our doc
not con tarn maten bv that accursed plague spot He would
have war with Mexico sooner than slaveiy should be driven
back to the United States, whence it came ' If that is to be the
avowed opinion of this committee, m God's name let my cor
sutuents know it, let the constituents of all the free States i(
the Union know it—the sooner it is proclaimed upon tht
housetops the better The House is to go to war with Mexico
for the purpose of annexing Texas to this Union Yes; and
the gentleman produced, as a triumphant authoriiy, (not indeed
in bis eyes, for he has not been in the habit of regarding th 1
source of it with much re&pect, but still as good authority,) a
document from a foi mer administration, intended by him to
justify the existing Executive in proclaiming that he was re
solved to do all m his power for the annexatior of Texas Yes,
a predecessor of the present incumbent—even myself, forwanfc
of better authority- wjs lefcrred to, and alleged to have enter
tamed the same feeling, the same disposition for the acquisition
of tnis territory
1 he gentleman was so good as to send me two letters written
by a distinguished gentleman now in my eye, then Secretary of
State, to our Minister at the court of Me vico, I have not had
line to rea I them ovei [A voice ' The evtracts are given m
the Intelligencer ] Fiom th >se letters the gentleman caused
certain extracts to be read with a view to prove that m 1825.,
and again m 1827, instructions had been given to propose to the
Mexican Government a cession oí the teintory of Texas to the
Itio del Norte and a sum of money was to be offered m con
sideration I thank him for citing this paper, it isacorreit
d icumeut I had myself, m the negotiation of our treaty wi h
Spain, labored to set he Rio del Norte as our bourtdaty, and I
ddhered to the demand till Mr Monroe and all his cabinet di ^'
lected me to forego it, and to assent to take the Sabine
And now I repeat what I have said befbre—that before the
treaty war signed it was carried by me, at the command of Mr
Momoe, to General Jackson who, affer examining it wuh the
map in his hand, approved of the Sabine as the boundary
That fact was contested, with the usual candor of the organ o/
the administration, and it was declared that a momber of tha
House went to General Jackson, in person, and he recollected
nothing of the matter   I then sent for the document in which
