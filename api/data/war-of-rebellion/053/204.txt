CIRCULAR.] HDQRS. SECOND DIV., SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,

La Grange, Tenn., October 9, 1863.

The contemplated movement of the troops from this place is hereby postponed until further orders from these headquarters.

By order of Brig. General T. W. Sweeny, commanding:

L. H. EVERTS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

(To brigades and detachments.)

LA GRANGE, October 9, 1863. (Received 10th.)

Major-General HURLBUT:

I reported to General Sweeny at 8 o'clock this evening. At dark there was no movement of the enemy discovered by the cavalry. The enemy gave up skirmishing with me 5 miles this side of Salem at 4 o'clock p.m. General Sweeny issues orders to the cavalry not through me. I believe, however, he is concentrating the most of the La Grange and Corinth cavalry here.

E. HATCH,

Colonel.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tenn., October 9, 1863.

Brigadier General E. A. CARR,

Corinth, Miss.:

If the enemy really mean fight, or are in your judgment likely to stand at all, move upon them with infantry and artillery. I have directed Sweeny to hold Spooner's brigade at La Grange. You can borrow what force you require from Sherman's command, and with our cavalry should be able to break them up.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

CORINTH, October 9, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

I have telegraphed Sweeny to assume command of all troops and attack. He has only 1,500 infantry of his own. Please re-enforce him as far as possible. I have no troops nor cars. I expect the line will be cut soon. Third Michigan started this morning. If you do not approve my orders please countermand them.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General.

CORINTH, October 9, 1863.

General SWEENY,

La Grange:

Assume command of all the troops near you, including cavalry and Sherman's men, and move out and attack the enemy.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General.
