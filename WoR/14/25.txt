
Barnard returns. Whether the Navy can, or not, do anything, I think it evident they cannot before you can ship another division of Heintzelman's to Old Point. I spoke to the President, and he thought this would be best, so as not to keep the means of transportation idle. I would therefore send Heintzelman's second division at once or as soon as you can. His first arrived safe last night and was landing. The Secretary says you should have no difficulty with Wool.

In answer to a dispatch received by me last evening from the Secretary of War I have to inform you that Hamilton's division, which left here Tuesday, will land at Fort Monroe. The arrangements required for its accommodation at that place will be made by the Quartermaster's Department.

It is as yet uncertain what other divisions, if any, will land at Fort Monroe. Should any other troops disembark there, they will be provided for by the staff department of the army.
