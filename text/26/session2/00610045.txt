THE CHARTER Or TEE UTV tfr WASHINGTON
Mr NORVELL, pursuant to notice, asked and
obtained leave to introduce A bill to amend and
continue in force an act for ine mcoiporat on of the
City of Washington The |i 1 was read twice and
Mr N moved us reference toa selecicommittee
Mr MERHICK objec ed to such a reference
True, a bill of a similar character had been so re-
ferred tne last session ot Congreso, to vvh ch he had
consented, because, at that la e period of the ses-
sion, he did not think it possible that the Committee
on the District o Columbia could give it such at-
tention as it required to mature 11, but now, at the
commencement of a session, he hoped this bill
would be referred to th- appropriate committee—
that on the District of Columbia
Mr NORVELL, after «■omc remarks on the con-
stitution of the present Committee on the District of
Columbia, said his wish was to pkue tne bill 111 f>e
ha ids of a committee lhat would be favorab'e to its
objects. It was his misfortune, at the last ses ion,
in reporting this bill from the splect committee to
which it had been referred, to have overlooked an
omission ot the copying clerk, which had since been
made the foundation of an accusation against hm
and other Senators who compo ed th it corami tec
He desired, therefore the reference 01 Inis bill 10 a
select committee, that he might have an opportunity
to set himself right on that po nt.
Mr MERRICK said the Senator from Micm
gan would have amp'e opportunity to ^et himself
right, and to explain this omj> on in llv bi 1 ot last
session, whenever the bill Com„ up ft r diccussi< n
before this body. He did not know ' ow Hut Se-
nator could undertake to as-'Ui íe that the Commit
tee on the District of Columbia wa" hostile to a
new chatter, foi there hud been no evidence to ju -
tify 'he as umption Tne committee oí the last
¡ ession- and the committee of this s ■ssion % as
composed of nearly the same mernb<_r„—it he re-
collected right, wtie in favorof a lemodifica un of
the charter, but th-re wa„ not time to enable ihcm
to obtain the necessary mfo-mation on which to
report a bill, and he hoped now there was to be 110
party organization in rtterence to the chaitcr fir
this part of the District of Colombia It was Hue
that the present standing committee consisted ex-
clusively of Whigs, which was a pioof that the
gentleman who appointed them had confidence m
those appointed, lhat they would do their
duty fairly and faithfully, and he katw of no rea
son now why there should be such a gratui-
tous assumption that the committee was hostile
to the measure, and that tnerefore it shou'd not
have its appropriate reference. He wots'd act on
evety question on its merits, and he would not in-
quire to what f arty the memorialists m git belong
Mr NORVELL had no intention to prolong the
discussion In reference to the remarks of the Sj-
nater from Maryland, that he should disregaul pa1"-
ty influence, and did not look at party distinctions,
he (Mr Norvell) was not solicitous to proclaim
sentiments of that character It was well known
there were certain principles on which parties in
this country were divided, and it was not for him
to admit tha he had no patty bia^ he had a de-
cided party b as, and whenever questions were pre
sented to him m which the distinctive paity prmn
pies were involved, it would govern his ac ion It
it had not been co—if it had not been tint there
were party distinctions—he and the honorable gi n
tleman from Maiyland might not have occupied
their present positions He asked for the ayes and
noes on the question of reference
Mr CLAY of Alabama hsped the gentleman
from Michigan would be grí lifted, when certain
lact  were known, which had mtervr ed between
this and the lis1 se non he thought it was due to
lhat gentleman that a select committee should be
appointed. It was manifestly the lead ng motive
of tne fnends of the b 11 at the last se sion to ex-
tend th* right ci suffrpge to many who had before
been deprived of it the bill was ordered to be en-
grossed, but, m th'copying, one or two clauses had
been accidentally omitted, and the omission was
only ch covered when it w?s too late to rec-
t.fy ti e error, unless by unanimous consent,
vihell was ntt obtained, as a gentleman on
the other side oljtctcd Under these circum-
stances he (Mr Cuy) uoved to lay the bill
on the tab e with ai intimation that at the
precent se «ion it v ould be brought up agam But
what use bad Ic made rf thi ' Why it ha]
been pjbhshel through this Union, that he and his
fnends had attempted to introduce m'o a bill re-
specting the District oí Columb a the principle of
Abolition Ye , the fa s  and Handeious charge bad
b en copied into every dirty party sheet, and 111 his
State especial!}, ¡ hedbeetumputed to him—falsely
and slanderously imputed to h'm—and not only to
him, but the same iccusntion had been made ge
n rally against h s co league and the friends of
unversal suffiage wl o voted with him He
hoped that this bill would be eo nrmttcd to a spe
ciil eommitiee, not only becaus- it was according
to an established parltamenlary pimciple lhat a
bill should be referred to a committee, a majority
oí which, at least, was favorable to its principle,
but that at all events he and his friends might be
permitted to do themselves justice, in view of the
accusations of tho e who had so foully slandered
them.
Mr MERRICK di c'aimi d any hoMih y to the

Mr PRFSTCV oppo ed the special reference,
and argued thn> the bi 1 ought to h  refe red to the
standing committee for the District lie thought
the question ol an extension ol th right of suffice
was one of great import?nce, and one that rcqu red
the piofoundest consideration In his own State he
hid expre sod his opiu on that it wa^. a gre^it \v int
of policy to rest ict the light of suffrage, except as
tocclot in a sUvehoklng S a e, where one half
the workirg cías es were struck out, it seemed to
him to be an odious d stirc ion among the whucs
and he des'red 10 disfianehi e ro one In this pi n-
ciple hp aequiescd—hs pnncip ( he advocated
b it he had yet as a Senator, to be convince 1
wh ther his iscuth Carolina doct ine was apphca
ble to tee District of Columba He would a^k
the people here what they desire, and look to wha'
extent it would pffect their institution*, their habits,
the,r prejudices, and their disposition , he preferred
therefore that this matter should go to the Com-
mittee on the Dis net 01 Columbia
Mr SOUTHARD also advocated th" reference
of the bill to the Committee on the DistnU oí Co-
lumbia. On th  ab ttact question of human rights,
his opinions ceuld not be mistaken, but they must
recollect they were legislating for this District,
which was w.thout repie^entitioti, and they should
look a little further They must consider who it was
here that had a right to vole, and «hat was their re-
sidence here, what was then mtertst here, and how
it would affect the great ms tutions of the South;
and a hundred other questions they must ask them-
selves, before they decided on a measure of this im-
poriance The Senator ui'ght get a special com-
mit ee, lhat would arrive ata conclusion with won-
derful rapidity, bat he assured him that if it were
referred to ihe Committee on the District of Co-
lumbia, that commiuee would reflect and examine,
and tnf n decide according to their best judgments
re pectmg the mteresis to be affected.
Mi HUBBARD said, it occurred to him it was
unnecessary to discuss the merits of ihe bill which
the committee appointed at the last sessioj report-
ed Tn t subject was not ro  b fore them, but it
might be well for the Senate to consider what was
ti e prec se question which they hid to determine.
He had a perfect recollection of the whole history
of this affair, and he wouli urdenake to relate it.
It was m con cjuencc of certain resolutions and
memorials pre ented to this House in the month of
February, 1840, by thf Senators from Ohio, in re-
i?tion to thi very matter, which were referred to
tie Committee on the District of Columbia—a
committee which was constituted neuly as at pre-
sent—and o'l which, as It e as ihe 5'h of June, no
report had been made, that oth r memorials were
presented by the Senator from Michigan, and a
special committee was appointed, of which the Se-
nator from Michigan [Mr Norvell] was the chair-
man Now he [Vlr Hubeard] as the chairman of
theCommUteconCUuns woulu be glad to be reliev-
ed Ircm ihe con ideiation of many claims, by their
inference to a s lect committee, and he believed the
Sena 01 from Kentucky, [Mr Critií,nden,] and the
S nttjr from Mar,luid, [Mr Mi rrick ] absented
to, if they d'd n it reco rmend, thf appointment of a
«e ect comm ttee on th •> subject fne very reason
wh) a bill should be kept b°fi re a standing com-
mittee which had it 111 us care, would induce him
to desire that this bill vhould again go to a select
committee, which hid had 1 in its consideration.
He thought it was not too much to ask for this.
The select committee, of wh ch the Senator from
Mich gan was the head, had had tne memorial, on
which hi b II was b-ised, in the r ci e, they had
made a u p r<. thereon, and he did thuk the subject
s'icul 1 be kept v here  1 v ns last c sien
