We are embarrassed to ship such material to North Carolina to prepare to meet General Sherman's army, and to establish a new railroad construction corps at Pensacola would make new demands upon the marine transportation and upon the resources of this department difficult to meet. I have consulted Lieutenant-General Grant upon the subject, and he replies that we have no time to build railroads there now, and that the supplies called for this should not be sent.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General and Brevet Major-General.
