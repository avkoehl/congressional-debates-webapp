Washington City, May 30, 1862 - 9.30 p. m.

Major-General MCDOWELL, Rectortown, Va.:

I send you a dispatch just received from Saxton at Harper's Ferry:

The rebels are in line of battle in front of our lines. They have nine pieces of artillery, and in position, and cavalry. I shelled the woods in which they were, and they in return threw a large number of shells into the lines and tents from which I moved last night to take up stronger position. I expect a great deal from the battery on the mountain, having there 9-inch Dahlgren bearing directly on the enemy's approaches. The enemy appeared this morning and then retired, with the intention of drawing us on. I shall act on the defensive, as my position is a strong one. In a skirmish which took place this afternoon I took 1 horse. The enemy lost 2 men killed and 7 wounded.

R. SAXTON,

Brigadier-General.

It seems the game is before you. Have sent a copy to General Fremont.
