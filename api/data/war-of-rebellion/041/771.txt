Major General E. O. C. ORD,

Vermillion Bayou:

GENERAL: The dispatch of Major-General Franklin of yesterday was received last night by the general commanding. The condition of the supply departments in the field being now good, the commanding general desires that, if practicable, a compact force be advanced against the present positions of the enemy; that his force be dispersed, and a point occupied which will give us access to Barre's Landing, establishing a new line of communications.

He desires that information be promptly communicated to these headquarters, and to the quartermaster at Brashear, of the time of occupation of such position, in order that a boat already laden and armed at Brashear may be promptly dispatched tot he Courtableau. He also recommends a reconnaissance to the mouth of the Courtableau as soon as the advance of the troops will justify it, as precautionary measure regarding the new line of communication.

examinations of the route west should be continued when practicable.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
