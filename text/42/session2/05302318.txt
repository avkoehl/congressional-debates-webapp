THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 10,
(H. R. No. 1496) to carry out certain pro-
visions of the Cherokee treaty of 1866, and
for the relief of settlers on the Cherokee lands
in the State of Kansas.
Mr. POMEROY. I said yesterday that I
â– would ask the consideration of this bill as the
same provision passed the Senate at the last
Congress and at this Congress, though not
this identical bill, i ask for its present con-
sideration.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Has it been referred ?
The VICE PRESIDENT. It has not been.
There was a colloquy about it last evening just
before the adjournment.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I think a matter of that
importance ought to go to a committee. I
insist on its reference: it will only delay the
bill a day.
Mr. POMEROY. The committee havejust
reported.
Mr. EDMUNDS. But my friend says it is
not the same thing identically.
Mr. POMEROY. There is only one change,
and I will state what it is. They reported that
the Indians should receive a dollar and a half
and a dollar and a quarter for their lands, and
the House bill puts it at two dollars. It is the
only difference between the Senate bill and the
House bill.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Has the House bill been
printed so that we can compare them?
The VICE PRESIDENT. It has not been
printed.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I make the motion that
it be referred to the Committee on Indian
Affairs, and then of course it will be printed
under the rule.
Mr. POMEROY. I have no objection to
that.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will be
printed and referred to the Committee on
Indian Affairs.
Mr. POMEROY. I only say that the com-
mittee have considered it and reported it twice,
and it has passed the Senate twice. Now, if
the Senator desires to have it passed three
times through the committee and three times
through the Senate, I do not object.
Mr. EDMUNDS. All right.
The bill was referred to the Committee ou
Indian Affairs.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill (H. R.
No. 1027) to perfect navigation on the Missis-
sippi river was by arrangement to be laid be-
fore the Senate this morning; but the Chair
understands that the Senator from Minnesota
[Mr. Ramsest] desires that the bill shall go
over un*;il to morrow morning.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Why is it not referred
to the Committee on Commerce?
Mr. RAMSEY. The Senator himself asked
to have it lie on the table and be printed, and
it has been printed.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Now it ought to be re-
ferred to the proper committee.
Mr. RAMSEY. Our committee have had
the matter under consideration a long time,
and have reported the very same bill.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Thisisa House
bill similar, as the Senator from Minnesota
stated, to a Senate bill reported by the Senate
committee on the same subject.
Mr. EDMUNDS. If this is the bill that
provides for selecting pine lands, and having
a general hocus-pocus on the subject of that
grant, then 1 want it referred in the regular
way to the Committee on Public Lauds.
Mr. RAMSEY. I have no objection to
having it referred, but there is no hocus-pocus
about it.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Well, I withdraw the
hocus-pocus.
Mr. RAMSEY. If the Senator fiom Ver-
mont withdraws the hocus pocus, I will agree
that the bill shall be referred to the Commit-
tee on Public Lands.
1 he bill was referred to the Committee on
Public Lands.
FRANCES A. M KINHEY.
The VICE PRESIDENT appointed Messrs.
Trumbull, Scott, and Thurman the commit-
tee of conference on the disagreeing votes of
the two Houses on the bill (H. R. No. 1866)
for the relief of Mrs. Frances A. MeKinney.

Resolutions upon the subject of French spoliations.
Whereas there are now residing in this Common-
wealth many children and grandchildren of enter-
prising merchants who were impoverished by the
seizure of their ships and cargoes in time of peace
upon the sea by French cruisers, in violation of the
law of nations; and whereas the claims of these
merchants were fully recognized by France, and
their collection assumed by the United States, and
they were subsequently released by the United
States to France for full and adequate considera-
tions, under a treaty which relieved the United
Sta.tes from the onerous guarantees and obligations
to which they were subjected by the treaties of alli-
ance and commerce with France in 1778, which ex-
posed them to war with other nations; and whereas
the merchants thus deprived of their property, so
appropriated by the United States, thereby acquired
just claims against the United States for their prop-
erty applied for public uses, under the constitu-
tional provision that private property shall not be
taken for public use without just compensation;
and whereas neither the unhappy sufferers nor their
heirs have received any compensation whatever
therefor, although some of the heirs of those mer-
chants, once in affluence and thus impoverished,
have become charges upon the State, and others are
dependent upon the charity of their friends, and
liable to become a charge to the public, and the
State is interested in obtaining aprovision for their
wants by the recovery of their claims against the
Federal Government as their natural guardian:
Tnereiore,
Jtemhed, That our Senators and Representatives
in Congress be requested to use their best efforts to
recover those just debts so long withheld, and to
aid, by all proper means, the passage of any hill for
tneir speedy and equitable liquidation.
Jtesolved, Tiint his excellency the Governor be
requested to send a copy of this resolution to our
bcuators and Representatives in Congress.
ItiiVUNUB BILLS.
Mr. SHERMAN. I am directed by the
Committee on Finance to report back the res-
olution of the House of Representatives de-
claring the amendments of the Senate to the
bill (H. R. No. 1537) to repeal the existing
duties on tea and coffee to be in contravention
with the Constitution, and to ask that it be
referred to the Committee on Privileges and
Elections. In making this report I will ac-
company it with a brief statement.
This is the first time in the history of the
Government that the power of the Senate to
propose amendments to revenue bills has
been questioned or limited by the House of
Representatives. The Committee on Finance
having already committed themselves upon
that question, thought it best to allow this
matter to be presented to the Committee on
Privileges, a committee organized by this
body to take charge of that cfass of subjects.
So far as the^ommittee on Finance are con-
cerned, we are unanimously of the opinion
that the Senate have the same power to pro-
pose amendments to a revenue bill that they
have to any other bill. The Constitution ex-
pressly declares in so many words that " the
senate may propose or concur with amend-
ments" to revenue bills " as on other bills;"
and from the foundation of the Government
