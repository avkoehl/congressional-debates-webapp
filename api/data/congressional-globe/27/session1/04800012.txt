APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June, 1841.
2Tth Cong.......1st Sess.
Report from the Department of State
Senate and H. of Reps.
piracy cannot, in its progress; or by its success, ob-
tain a claim to any degree of respectability, or to-
lerance, among nations, and civil wars, therefore,
are not understood to hare such a commencement.
It is well known to Mr. Pox that authoring of
the highest eminenc in England, living and dead,
have maintained that the general law of nations
does not forbid the citizens or subjects of one Go-
vernment from taking part in the civil commot ons
of another There is «ome reason, mdc«d, lo think
that such may be the opinion of her Majesty's Go-
vernment at the present moment
The undersigned has made these remark' from
the conviction that it is important to regard est?-
blished distinctions, and to view the acts and of-
fences of individuals in the exactly proper 1 ght
But it is not to be inferred that there is, on the part
of this Government, any purpose of extenuating, in
the slightest degree the crimes of tho e persons, ci-
tizens of the United States, who have joined in mili-
tary expeditions against the British Government in
Canada On the contrary, the President directs
the undersigned to say that it is his fixed resolution
that all such disturbers of the national p ace and
violaters of the laws of their country shall be
brought to exemplary punishment Nor will the
fact that they are instigated and led on to these ex-
cesses by Brit sh subjects refugees from the Pro-
vinces, be deemed any excuse or palliation, al-
though it is well worthy of being remembered that
the prime movers of these disturbances on the bor-
ders are subjects of the duecn who come within
the territories of the United States, seeking to enlist
the sympathies of their citizens, by all the motives
which they are able to address to them, on account
ef grievances, real or imaginary. There is no rea
son to believe that the design of any hostile move-
ment from the United States against Canada has
commenced with citizens of the United fetate  The
true origin of such purposes and such enterprises
is on the other side of ihe line But the President's,
resolution to prevent these tran«gressu ns of the
laws is not, on that account, the les* strong Ii is
taken, not only m conformity to his duty under
the provisions of existing laws, but in full c( n o-
nanee with the established principles and praet ce
of this Government
The Government of the United Stat s has not,
from the first, fallen into the doubt1-, e sewhere en-
tertained, of the tru° extent of the duties of neutra-
lity It has held that, however it may have been
in less enlightened ages, ihe just interpretation of
the modern law of nations is, that neutral Slates
are bound to be strictly neutral, and that it is a
manifest and gres impropr ety for individual to
engage tn the civil conflicts of other States, and
thus to be at war, while treir Government is at
peace. War and peace are high national rela-
tion1:, which can properly be esiabli hed or changed
only by nations themselves
The United States have thought, also, that the
salutary doctune of non-intervention by one na-
tion with the affairs of o'hers is liable to be essen-
tially impaired/if, while Government refrains from
interference, interference r  still allowed to its sub-
ject", individually or in masses It may happen*
indeed, hat person  choose to leave their country,
emigrate to other legions, and settle themselves on
uncultivated land', in territories belonging to other
States. This cannot be prevented by Govern-
ments which allow the emigration of their subjects
and citizens, and such persons, having voluntarily
abandoned their o*n country, have no longer
claim to l's protection, nor is it longir responsible
for their acts Such eases, ther<fore, if they oc
cur, show no abandonment of the duty of neu-
trality
The Government of the United States has not
considered it assufficent to confine the duties of
neutrality and non-interference to the cas" of Go-
vernments whose termor es he adjacent to eaca
other. The application of the prmc pie may be
more necessary in «urn cases, but the principle it-
self they regard as be ng the came, if those ternto
nesbe divided by half the globe The rule is
founded m the impropriety and danger of allowing
individuals to make war on their own authority,
or, by mingling themselves in the belligerant opera-
tions of other nations, to run the hazard of coun-
teracting the policy, or embroiling the reUtion , of
their o#n Government And ihe United State"
have been the first among civilized nat'ons to en-
force the observance of this just rule of neutrality
and peace, by special and adequate legal enact-
ments In the infancy of this Government, on the
breaking out of the E iropean wars wh ch had their
origin in the French Revolution, Congress passed
law:  with severe penalties, for preventing the citi-
zens of the United States from taking part m those
hostilities
By these laws, it prescribed to the citizens of
the United States what it understood to be their
duty, as neutrals, by the law of nation^, and the
duty, also, which they owed to the interest and
honor of their own country
At a subsequent period, when the American co
lomes of an European power took up arms against
their sovereign, Congress, not diverted frfem the
established system of the Government by any tem-
porary considerations, not swerved from its sense
of justice and of duty by any svmpathies which it
might naturally feel for one of the parties, did not
hesitate, also, to pass acts applicable to the Ga«e of
colonnl insurrection and civil war And thebe
provisions of law have been continued, revised,
amended, and are m full force at the present mo-
ment Nor have they been a dead letter, as it is
well known that exemplary punishments have
been írflicted on those who have transgressed
them It is known, indeed, that heavy penalties
■«ave fallen on individuals citizens of t"e United
Slates, engaged in this very disturbance in Cana-
da, with which the destruction of the Caroline was
connected And it is in Mr Pox's knowledge,
als->, that the act of Congress of Mirch 10th, 1838,
was passed for the precise purpose of more effeet l-
ally restraining military enterprises from the United
States into the British provinces, by authorizing
the use of the most sure and decisive preventive
means The unJe-signed may add that it s'ands
on the admission ot very high Bntish authority,
that during th  recent Canadian troubres aithouph
borlies of adventurers appeared on the border, mak-
ing it necessary for the people of Canada to keep
themselves in a state prepared for self defence, yet
that these adventurers were acting by no means m
accordance with the feelings of the great mass of
the American people, or of the Government of the
United States
This Government, therefore, not only holds it-
self above reproach in every thing respecting the
observation of neutrality, the observance of tne
pnnciple of non intervention, and the strictest con-
formity, in these respects, to the rules of interna-
tional law, but it doubts not that tne world will do
it the justice to acknowledge that it has set an ex-
amnle not unfit to be followed by others, and that,
by its steady legislation on this most important sub-
ject, it has d"re something to promote peace and
good neighborhood among nations, and to advance
the civilization of mankind
The undersigned trusts that, when her Br tannic
Majesty's Government shall present the grounds at
length, on which they justify the local authorities of
Canada matt'ckmg and des royins the ' Caroline,"
they will consider that the laws of the United States
are such as the unders gned has now represented
them, and that the Government of the United
States has always manifested a sincere disposition
to see those laws effectually ard impartially ad-
ministered If there have been ca^es in which
individuals, justly obnoxious to punishment, have
escaped, this is no more than happens in regard to
other laws
Under these circumstances, and under those im-
mediately connected with the transaction if=elr, it
will be for her Majesty's Government to show up-
on what state of f-icts and what rules of national
law the destruction of the "Caroline" is to be
defended. It will be for that Government to
show a necessity of self-defence, msiart, orer
whe'rmng, leaving no choice of means and no
moment for deliberation It will be for it to
show, also, that the 1 cal authori íes of Canada,
even supposing the necessity of the moment au-
thorized them to enter the territories of the United
States at all, did nothms; unreasonable or excessive,
since the act, justified by the necessity of self-de-
fence, must be limited by that necessity and kept
clearly withm it It must be shown that admoni-
tion or remonstrance to ihe persons on board the
Caroline was impracticable, or would have been
unavailing, it must be shown that daylight could
not be waited for, that there could be no attempt at
discrimina'ion between the innocent and the guilty;
that it would not nave been enough to seize and de-
tain the \essel, but thai there was a necessity, pre-
sent and me^itab'e, for attacking her m the dark-
ness of the night, wmle moored to the shore, and
wmle unarmed men were asleep on board, killing
some and wounding others, and then drawing her
m'o the current, above ihe cataiact, setting her on
fire, and, careless to know whether mere might not
be in her the innocent w,th the guilty, or the living
with the dead, commuting her to a fate which fills
the imagination with horror A necessity for all
this the Government of the United States cannot
bel eve to have existed
All will see that if such things be allowed to oc-
cur, they might lead to bloody and exasperated
war, and when an individual comes into the
United States from Canada, and to the very
plac  on which this drama was performed, and
there chooses to make public and vainglorious
beast of the part he acted in it, it is hardly
wonderful that great excitement should be created,
and some degree of commotion arise
This Republic does not wish to disturb the tran-
quillity of the world. Its object is peace, its policy
peace. It seeks no aggrandizement by foreign
conquest, because it know  that no foreign acquisi-
tion cou'd augment its power and importance so
rapidly as they are already advancing by its own
natural growih under tne propitious circumstances
of its, situation Bin it cannot adm t that its Go-
vernment has not both the will and the power to
preserve its own neutrality, and to enforce tne ob-
servance of us own laws upon its own ci iZens
It is jealous of its rights, and among others, and
most esp cially, of the right of the absolu e immu-
nity of its territory aga nst aggression from abroad,
and these rights it is the duty and the determina-
tion of this Government fully and at all times to
maintain, while it will, at the same time, as scru-
pulously refrain irom infringing on the lights of
o h-rs
Tiie President instructs the undersigned to say,
in conclusion, that he confidently trusts that this
and all other questions of difference be ween the
two Governments will be trea'ed by both in the
fall exercise of sach a spirit of candor, justice,
and mutual respect as shall give assurance of the
long continuance of peace between the two coun-
tries
The undersigned avails himself of this oppor-
tunity to assure Mr Pox of his high consideration.

Copy  f instructions to Mr   Crittenden, enclosed in

Department of State,

port, m the State of New York, under an indict-
ment for murder, alleged to have been committed
by him in the attack on and destruction of the
steamboat Caroline at Schlosser, in that State, on
the night of the 39 h December, 1837, and his
trwl is expected to take place at Lockport on the
22d instant
You are apprised of the correspondence which
took place between Mr Forsyth, late Secretary of
State, and Mr Fi x, her Britannic Majesty's Minis-
ter here, on this subject, m D cembir last.
In his note to Mr Fox of the 26th of lhatmonth,
Mr Forsyth says "If the destruction of the Caro-
Une was a public act of per'ons in her Majesty's
service, obe) ing the order of their superior authori-
ties, this fact has not be n before communicated to
the Government of the United States by a person
authorized to make the admission, and it will be
for the Court which has taken cognizance of the
offence with which Mr McLeod is charged to
decide, upon its validity when legally established
before it
