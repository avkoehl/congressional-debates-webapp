Making public officers depositories—Mr, Mason.
H. of Reps.
aluem the market to ihe extent of guth new dcm ukÍ—mel o
that sarna extent you postpone the day when it c in return into
use as a pait of the circulating medium Until that day comes,
It is impossible for the banks to pay out specie upon their no*es
They never can do ao until the demand upon them is reduced
to a naked demand foi circulation If I am conect m this
reasoning, the beet that could be hoped, under the proposed
Jaw, would be that it should remain a dead letter upon the
etatute book
I think I have Shown that we could have no return toa ch
culatton of specie under its auspices , and if this be se, do yon
believe, does any man believe, that the law could be carried
into effect 1
What, su, that the Government alone should be paid m ai'
ver and gold, when those \v ho ha\ e the payments to make
receive nothing but uredeemable paper'   How vditi am1 idle
it is to expect any such thing    If, by any chance 01 luc^y
accident, oyer ruling those stern necessities to which all hi man
affairs are subject, the exigency ol the times should have passed
by before youi policy begins, then it might, thus chance
favored, be that the scheme could be carried out    But it be
comes us not to legislate upon such improbable contingencies
I want no bettei evidence of where the Government would be
twelve months hence, under the operation of this law, than
what is now daily passing before om eyes    Theie are, it is
said, (and I presume at least with an appioxnnation to truth,)
now m this country eighty millions of dollars in comed metal
By the existing lav , (as there is no bank paper convertible into
specie,} Government can now receive nothing but com m pay
ment of any part of its revenue    I ask confiden tly, is any pai t
of that revenue eo paid?   With aU this abund ince ol the pie
clous metals, fully three times as much ah we have had at any
former period, do we not all know that none whatever is paid
into the Treasury from any source of íevenue ?   I mean none,
when compared even with the lowest necessity of the public
service    The mint, it is true, does furnish a small supply,
merely sufficient if at all, to meet those demands which com
will alone satisfy    But this does not come in any shape oí
revenue—far from it   It is purchased by Government at mar
kU rates, and a premium paid upon eveiy dollai that is brought
in    Such ts the present state of things, undpr the operation ol
a hard money law, while the only money m the country is in
irredeemable paper, and such must ever edntinue to be youi
condition, underfthe opeiation of any laws that you may pass,
eo long as the money which you requue is banished, by what
ever cause, from the channels of cnculation
I lay down then this position, and defy any refutation That
the GovBrnmentfonust, as a •permanent necessity^ deal in th-u
currency m which the People deal, it is the law of its creation,
and inseparable from its condition It must íeceive what the
People receive, and pay what they pay—a necessity A om which
Government cannot escape if it would, and ought not if u
could
I speak of this as a permanent necessity, distinguished fiom
the necessities ot immediate want It is struggling now
against this veiy want, and precisely as any large capitalist
might equally do, by using the resources of its ciuht, to up
ply the temporary absence of íevenue Have we not just
passed a law, authorizing an issue of ten millions of Tieasuiy
paper, lor this very purposeÍ I mean foi the single pmposo
of rescuing the Government fiom the necessity of coming down
at once to the irredeemable papei of th' banksi And this only
to answer the present emeigency, ioi it will ceitamly follow,
unless that medium can be lest led, in which alone the Govern
ment is allowed to deal, that we must issue at least ten millions
more before we return home from the ensuing session Sir I
went coidiaUy with you in this use ol Government credit, and
I wu\ do so agam finould the emeigency continue But I tell
you faiily and candidly, andl ten the people too, that this
Treasury issut is all that saves the Government now from
coming down at once to bank patier I «rty tlu^ an In u e
youi reven ic 1 iw , exacting gold ind sitvci, an. n u nlc ui
not be enforced If you collect any íevenue it can only be 111
that very paper, because theie is nothing else to pay with
Suppose, then, your law passed, and the cuuency remain,
as under such policy it inevitably must, m the condition that
it now is, whataie you to do? If you could enfoice the law
then, I ask, why do you not do so now?
Why da you not new compel youi debtois to go into market
and buy specie, in older to leplenish the Treasury? So iar
from this, we have a bill now before us, which it is admitted on
all hands must pass, to save the Secretai y from the necessity of
so idle an attempt With more than foui millions of dolíais
now due in New York alone, so fai from exacting payment, we
aro about to give further tune on all bonds due, and to become
due, between this time and the next session of CongiebS
I say, then, confidently, pass what law you may, you cannot
have youi revenues paid m specie, so long as it lemain  at a
premium, and that the very fiist effect of this law, by seating
a new demand, would be to increase the premium and thus
render permanent the very exigencies to which youi legislation
is now actually yielding
But take anothei view of the subject Suppose- the law 11¡
lied out, what then would follow? The impoitei, besides all
other charges for freight, insurance, duties, etc is ltquned to
pay five or ten per centum for specie to pay the duties Cei
tainly this latter would be added té the pnce of the commodity
and thus the whole effect of your policy would be to tax the
people to this extent, m older that Government might de t! in
gold, while they were left to struggle on, unaided agamstall the
ills of worthless paper money
My view of the subject, then, 1 , that by passing this 1 tw now
you postpone to an indefinite period the resumption of pay
ment by the State banks that, until they do resume, the law
must be inoperative, and the Tieasmysuppliedby ]oanq or if
enforced, besides creating a new andhcavier tax upon all foieign
merchandise, the sole effect will be, to enuch the ofhee holdeis
and all who feed upon the public cub, at the expense oí the
rest of the community I know, sn, that this last objection
has been scouted as mere slang, as part of a me  "íabble '
and unworthy of notice But / tell you that it has nevei been
met, and that it cannot beovertkrown I do not believe (and
that disbelief is founded on the experience of the present (lay y
that such a law could be earned out But if it weie, the host
of Government dependents would grow nch undei ir Ihey
would have money woith five or ten dollars more in the hun
dred than the money used by the people, and the people would
be taxed to the extent of this five or ten dollars m the hundred,
to furmeh the former with the better curren y
Now, sir, in all this, my sympathies are with the tax oavert
suid not with the tax gatherers   I go for the interest of those
who are to pay, and not foi those who are- to íeceive I cannot
agree to any policy which might, and I believe would, lead to
these results It is unwise, unjust, and unnecessary, and it
coulo not, and ought not, to stand one day aftei those results ai e
ascertained
I may express myself strongly, but I do not mean to do so
haishly I see mischief and disaster without end, m any at
tempt to legislate now, as you would have us do by this bill,
and it ib to save ourselves from utter deleat and shame, that I
beg you to pause with me, and consider the consequences of
such attempt
Let me, before leaving this pait of the subject, piesent an
tohei view, which to my mind, increases the difficulties to be
encounteied by thepioposedlaw I have, so far, consideied
only th demand arming undei the accruing íevenue, as that
which is to retard the íesumption of specie payment But the
íevenue in anear, that of which we aie to postpone the pay
mt-nt, will corrc«fheavily in aid, to increase this demand at the
veiy out et of the new law, to what extent we do not as yet very
ccitainly know, but, reasoning fiom what we do know, the
promise is sufficiently appalling The duty bonds to bupobt
poned amount, in New York alone, to ttiotp than 7,000,000
dollai * computed to Januaiy next, and, including the other
cities, to moie than $10000,000, constituting, to such extent,
wliaicvei it may be, an obstacle at the outset over and above
what is to be encounteied in its ordinary course
I have heaid it said, howevei, that this veiy demand to be
cieated undei the law will have the eflect of bunging in specie
to meet it, and thus it is alleged that the demand will occasion
the supply I do not deny this in the least degree There is
nothing moie certain m every bianch of political economy,
than that there will be a supply for the demand But legara
foi one instant only what this demand i«, and the fallacy of the
leasoning will appeal at once It is a matket demand, which
is te produce this supply It is an increase only of the same
demand which ha" already banished coin fiom cnculation,
now it is purchased for exportation, then it will be purchased
'oi Government, and the effect will be precisely the same in
both tases—to give a marketable value to specie as merchan
dise, m lieu of the exchangeable value, which it would othei
wise have as money None will pretend that, because Govern
ment will pay it out again, it will thereby cnculate, unless they
can find the teim circulation fully satisfied in a constant round
fiom the custom house to the biokei, and fiom the broker to the
custom house
If it be tiue then that Government cannot command the pre
cious metals throuch its revenue until they leturnback to cir
culUion,the inquiry lemams to be answeicd how that end is
to be attained? I woull answer, fiist, it will be attained even
before a voiy long time, if matteis are allowed to remain,
as lai as Government is concerned, precisely wheie they
now are
he* us keep our hinds off, and tho banks will resume as
speedily is ícwvmg tiade will allow within what period Iwiil
notpioic s to answer but their course of dealing since the
bu pension evinces the ttioiifjost puiposc todo so, at the ear
host pi LCticabh diy fhctocuetaiyol the Tieasury tells us in
his report that since the suspension of payment 'the policy
puisuedbv most of them has been favorable to an early dis
( haigc of then engagements to the Treasury, and to a jesump
tion ol specie p tyments J And again, in proof of that position,
he says speaking of the deposite banks, that "since the 1st of
M ty, then discounts as 1 whole have been reduced about
&20 388 77b their cnculation «4,991,791, and their publiG de
pontes &15,607,31b; while then specie has diminished le&s than
¡5>3 000,000 ¡Such is the encouraging account which the Secie
tnyhim <lf give? us oí these institutions We have already
seen the tieatieductionm exchange since oui session began,
evidencing the íapid extinguishment of the foreign debt, and
tine arietta jmanifested by the approaching market foi the
h mthern staples Even the mesentationof the bill foi an issue
oí lita my papel hadan effect m bringing down exchange
Putting ill the^e tilings together, we may safely árgrtc that me
evil day is passing by an Tall that I uige upon you is to keep
hands oil, and let veiy well alone
fhe íesolution of 1816, now in full force, had the effect, at
that day, of bunging about a geneial resumption of payment by
the banks It will do so again, if Hsopeiation be unaffected
I have shown you alieady the piomise undei it But the bill
pioposes to íepeal that resolution, as the first step in the po
hey of the new law Then, the attitude of Government towards
these institutions was one of encouragment and confidence It
offeied inducements to them to íesume, and invited back the
r mfi lence oí the community The wisdom of that policy was
mam estedbytheiesult Now, the icry leveise is to be at
templed, m lieu of confidence, we piesent disci edit, for en
courage ment menace dtstiuciion I need not add that the same
t-tid cannot be obtained by such opposite meins
But, agun, sir, time is m this bill an entue departure from
the gi eat an 1 loading punciples of the late Admin is nation on
the subject of the cui lency It looks no fuUher than to a sup
ply of specie foi the Government and its dependents There is
¡10 account taken oí the moie impoitint object, of infusing
specie into cnculation foi the common use oi the people Then,
the great ctlort was to enliige the specie basis, by the suppres
sion of small note5 The Government, as the greatest cieditor
ol the bank", sought te effect this by the control incident to
its large deposite The banks were encouraged 111 everyway
toco operate and the ¡states were appealed to foi their aid, in
the common duty of aieformin thecuirency
Many (f them where theie was a bank issue under five
dollai &, met the appeal at once, by a direct prohibition to that
extent
But tne otate of Vn^uua went farther ¡she had long since
lealizei the benefits of a speue < nculation below five dollars,
bv a prohibition of ill papei under that amounf and on the
veiy fiist occasion when the chaiters of hei banks would be
reached,&oiccently abi uimg the ki*it wintci the prohibition
was extended to ten dolíais and to take effect at an eaily day
These were die measures then contemplated foi the improv e
ment of the curt ency, and begun to he earned out by the pow er
ful anl of Sine legWuion Why are they to be abandoned
now'' It v,a admitted then, and it is beyond all question tiue
that specie, either in gold 01 silvei, will not cnculate by the
side of paper If experience of this were wanting, it is abun
darum Vngima in reference to small noteg, as soon as they
weie expelled by hei law, silver took their place And theie
is no doubt that, if her policy could be carried out, by the ex
pulsion of all paper undei twenty dolíais, gold would flow at
once into the vacant channels    All this can yet be done by a
simple adherence to the original plan    But your policy is in
utter disregard of all such intent
The gi eat forcing process now in contemplation will work
the very reverse of what was then so strenuously urged It
will put all our golden dreams to flight, of the halcyon days of
hard money, and the States will be compelled, from sheei ne
cessity, to license once more the very lowest issue of bank
papei Seeing these things as I clearly do in prospect, under
the operation of the pioposcd law, I can have no choice but to
raise my voice against it
As to so much of the bill as conbtitutes the colfectois of tho
revenue, with the Mint and its blanches, depositones ol the
public money, I have but little to say It is certainly subject to
very stiong objections, not the leabt of which is the veiy great
increase oí pationage to which it must give use, and a pation
age of the most dangeious influence, as being so immediately
connected with the public money Neithei is this objection at
all answered when it is said thit the pationage will be lets
than that exercised in the mteieour&e between the Government
and ihe depobite banks, because, by the simple substitute of a
special foi a geneial deposite, all pationage wih be at on e
taken away and on the scoie of safety the diffeience is meal
enlabie
Whethei I regaid then, the pernicious influence which this
bill must exeicise upon the cuireney if now enacted into law,
01 the inadequacy ol its piovisions foi the safe keeping of the
money, I am equally constiamed to withhold my asaent In
the first aspect it has nevei been submitted to the counny anl
has had very little consideiation heie The innovation is too
great, the transition too violent fiom ali pievious usage, to be
thus suddenly met
The people are too deeply interested in the consequences
which may follow, to have this usage changed without the most
matute consideration For myself, sir, 1 want to go home
fiom this whole subject, re infecta It is a new proposition,
presented for the fiist time m an imposing form b} the late
Message, and, before adopted, should be well and thoioughly
canvassed before the country The Piesident himself m pio-
posing it, invites, and the subject is well woi thy of, the fulled
deliberation
Let it be discu&sed, then, as it will be, and as all gieat public
measures ought to be, by the people themselves, in then pn
mary assemblies, and thiough the press, before it i& enacted
into law
No inconvenience can possibly anse from this postpone
ment, first, because the time must necessaidy be shoit as Con
gress will be again in session within six weeks from the ad
journment, and, secondly, because the whole system pioposed
is now, undei the late oiders of the Tieasury in as full and
complete operation as if specially oidamed by the law ui dei
consideration TheSecietary has alieady adopted it, in the
exigency of the occasion, under the discretion chiven to him by
the law oigamzing the Ireasuiy Depaitment Theie i¡s no
occasion, then, for this gieat haste, and theie n> eveiy íeason
why we should foibear
We are told, however, by an honoiablemembei fiom South
Caioltna, (Mi Pickens,) that by oui opposition to the piesent
bill we aie stieugthemng the interest ot that party which seeks
the re establishment oí t national bank This suggestion, en,
has come fiom a veiy íemaikable quartei, I do not allude now
to the member fiom South Caiohna, but 10 a distinguished
statesman irom the '•ame State m the othei wmg ol the Capitol
The Sub Treasuries it is said must be oidaincd at once as the
only saieg laid against the restdiation oí a gieat national bank
mg institution and this vaticination ¡seems to be thiown out as
a sort of bugbeai, to high ten us into instant submission
Sir in my humble sphere at home or m the halls of oui
State Legislature, my opirtons on the subject of a redcr1'
bank need no new confe>si 11 I have ever been an uncompro
raising foe to any such institution I believe the existence ol
such a bank is inconsistent with the purity, and dangeious to
the safety of popular govemme it ihaveevei opposed it 111
everyfoim on gioundsol expediency and, what is above all,
tohx and confirm that opposition, I entertain no doubt what
evei that it has no sanction either in the spirit 01 in the letter
of the Constitution Stiongly committed, then, to such opi
nions, and having uniformly acted up to them m eveiy time of
trial—m the removal oí the depobitcs, thiough the panic era,
and the Executive veto—I am r ot to be frightened tiom what I
have taken as the path of duty by the new bom feaiseven of so
disUnguished a pioselyte
I distrust the quartei, sir, whence the denunciation comes I
have no confidence m that counsel which ¡-.pnr gb iiom the zeal
oí 1 ecent conversion Opinion^ that aie hastily taken up aie
as speedily laid aside, and aie woithy of no reliance whatevei
No, sn, in my humble judgment, the dangei oí recurrence ti 
a national bank is to b-> looked lot in the veiy opposite qn irt^i
~m the immatuie toncepnon and humed execution of tins
bub Treasurj scheme Ido not mean to ptedtct it, beciu e I
would not be undeistood as disparaging the judgment of those
who confide moreieadily than Ido But suppose they should
fail—suppose it should be found impracticable to cairy out the
new Bcheme—that the cunency should grow worse—that bank
paper should continue inedepmable—and tiie People become
wearied out with youi ngid exaction ot coin from them while
nothing but papei is paid them—I ask you, and I put it to the
serious consideiation of the countiy whatiemedy would then
be lound^ You could not fall back upon the State bank=
They had beenjustdivoiced, and common decency would 101
bid the new espousal Wheie then would yoi, find iclugca
Why, sir aa was done oncebefoie 111 the aims of a natioial
bank, and nowhere else
lam not at all answeied in the objections thus pdvaneed,
when lam told that my apprehensions of this laihue aie with
out foundation You íehed as confidently when the pubhc
money was transferred to the ¡state banks that (hey would not
fail Every official report, and every State papei was íeplete
with their commendation We were told that they were equal
to every emeigency m the fiscal opeiadons of the Government,
and furnished us best and safest reliance And yet within two
shorf yeais, the whole system is denounced as an entne iaihire
What better assurance cm you give us now than you offered
theni
Why may not youi new scheme faili I behove that it must,
inevitably must, if attempted now And when it does fail,
I can imagine no possible resource left but that which our
new convei t bo earnebtly deprecates I prav you to excuse me,
then if I do not see wi h his eyes
Sn, in attempting these Sub Tieasuucs now the Govern
ment, if I may so expiess it, is rctieaung to ihe citadel at once,
m the great battle with a National Bank    I see nothing but
