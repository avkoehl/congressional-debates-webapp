enemy's force, and, as the country is exceedingly intricate, I think we ought to be in strength to make victory sure, and I would like another brigade. Please reply at once.

In haste, yours,

HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS, White House, Va., July 2, 1863 - 9 p. m.

Major-General KEYES:

GENERAL: I have received your dispatch written at 7. 30 p. m., informing me that Colonel West had been attacked. You should fight the enemy on the ground you think most favorable to you - at Baltimore Cross-Roads, if you can; if not, then where you are. You should ascertain as early as possible in the morning the strength of the enemy. It is very desirable to hold Baltimore Cross-Roads, as a withdrawal from it opens the road to Tunstall's. I am confident of your ability to beat the enemy with the force you have, but I will hold a brigade in readiness to re-enforce you, if necessary, It is very undesirable to reduce the force here, and it can only be done in case of absolute necessity.

I am, very respectfully, yours,JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

[P. S.] - I send you a map, which I believe is pretty accurate.

GENERAL: Shortly after I wrote my last dispatch to you, Colonel West came in, having been driven back by very superior numbers, as he said. He fell back as far as Mr. Quall's house, where Major Stewart was with me. Colonel Porter is out there now, and is being pressed in. I am expecting them to open fire on me every moment. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. D. KEYES,
