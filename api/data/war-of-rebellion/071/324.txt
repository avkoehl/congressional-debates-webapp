Major General LEW. WALLACE:

GENERAL: Having been ordered to Washington, I leave this p. m., and the command of the troops in the department necessarily devolves upon you. The readiness with which you have co-operated in arranging the defenses and your desire to meet the enemy under my orders showed a zeal not always found under similar circumstances, and I shall remember it.

With great respect, I am, yours, truly,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.

If you will send the 100 men of Clendenin's (Eighth Illinois) cavalry, we have the horses to mount them. The cavalry is much needed here to assist in clearing out the guerrillas.

Major-General, Commanding.
