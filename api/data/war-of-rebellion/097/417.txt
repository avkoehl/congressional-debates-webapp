fired heavy volleys along the line, rendering it impossible for us to take the pits without a heavy force. The developments show they have a very strong force of picket resembling a line of battle. The picket officer reports it fully as strong as it was when we arrived here.

Respectfully, yours,

R. McALLISTER,

Brevet Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, SECOND ARMY CORPS, April 1, 1865.

Bvt. Brigadier General R. McALLISTER,Commanding Third Brigade:

GENERAL: The brevet major-general commanding directs me to inform you that General De Trobriand has been directed to send a regiment to report to you. He directs that you mass it on the high ground to the left of the swamp in readiness to support the line there in the event of an attack. He also directs that you leave works in front of your line, and make the line through the swamp and your whole line very strong by intrenching and slashing. It is important that this be done at once.

Very respectfully,

WM. R. DRIVER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS, April 1, 1865-12.30 a.m.

General WEBB,Chief of Staff:

I find that the dispatch* copied on the next leaf has not been sent you because of a break in the telegraph line. I believe it impossible efficiently to change the directions I have given before daybreak.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, April 1, 1865-12.20 [1.20?] a.m.

General MEADE:

I think we will have an infantry bridge over Gravelly Run sooner than I could send troops around by the Quaker road, but if I find any failure I will send that way. I have sent Benyaurd [two hours ago] with what he thought necessary to make it practicable in one hour, and I trust to that. I am sending to General Sheridan my most available force.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
