Brigadier General WILLIAM N. PENDLETON:

GENERAL: By direction of the Secretary of War, you will proceed with the artillery reserve to Gordonsville, and on arrival will report to General R. E. Lee, commanding army. A portion of my own division moves to-morrow, and it will be well for your artillery to march in their vicinity, if practicable. Such portion of your artillery as may not be needed at Petersburg should be ordered to this point.

Please report to me at the Spotswood Hotel.

Very respectfully, yours,

G. W. SMITH,
