Major-General COUCH,

Harrisburg:

You say the rebel force is 1, 500 at Chambersburg. Is there any other rebel force in Pennsylvania? If so, where, and in what numbers? An early and accurate answer is needed here, to determine movements against the enemy.

The only rebel force I know of in Pennsylvania is the one of 1, 500 that has fallen back of Chambersburg 2 miles. No rebels north of Hancock, as reported. We have reliable dispositions for getting information in the valley north of Hancock. Some of Milroy's stragglers retreated that way.
