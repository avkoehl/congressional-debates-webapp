General WALLACE,

Vernon:

I think it is too late to send to Osgood unless you learn from the operator of their return. Do not your scouts report that part of Morgan's force went toward Madison? Have you sent Love to Madison, or where is he? Capture of Osgood confirmed. Rebels probably marched toward Aurora and sent detachments to cut Indianapolis and Cincinnati Railroad, about ten miles distant. Please answer my dispatch about Burkham's command. Where is he?

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

OSGOOD, July 13, 1863.

General WILLCOX:

I suppose him (Morgan) to be between Harrison and North Bend. This road will fell him before morning, if it has not already. If he is not, then he intends boldly making the circuit of Cincinnati, to cross the river above Maysville.

Major-General.

General WALLACE,

Osgood:

Rebels have succeeded in tearing up Indianapolis and Cincinnati Railroad near sunman. Shryock after them. His force are divided. Do you hear anything of Hobson? Is he moving with alacrity? Where is Duke's force?

General WILLCOX,

Indianapolis:

I have everything ready to move, but nothing started yet. I beg to be allowed to proceed.

Major-General, &amp;c.

INDIANAPOLIS, July 13, 1863-11.10 p. m.

General LEW. WALLACE:

You are at liberty to march across to the Cincinnati and Indianapolis road, so as to support Hobson if he meets Morgan. We are sending troops to Hamilton. Report to me by telegraph on Cincinnati and
