over the whole country, that the prosperity of a part is the prosperity of the whole. In every way, therefore, the utmost care will be taken to teach the inhabitants that we are their friends and not their enemies, and that wherever the authority of the United States exists there is ample security for persons and property. No seizures of property will hereafter be made in any case without written instructions from competent authority, and commanding officers will be held responsible for the good conduct of their men. When in camp there will always be an effective system of camp and police guards, and no men will be permitted to leave camp except upon the pass of the regimental commander. The various camps will be located with a view to the health of the troops, and their sanitary condition closely attended to.
