of Ways and Means) to add to the end of that division of the
bill which relates to the "light house establishment" the fot
lowing amendment*
"For expenses of examining annually thecondi ion of the
light-bouses, four thousand dollars Provided That the com
missions of two and a half pei cent (and any arid all other
commissions) heretofore allowed to the supe an ten dents of
lighthouses be discontinued in rill cases where tiv compensa
turn oí the collector as such and as superintendent oí light
houses, including fees perquisites, official saares of fine foi
failures, and penalties, and commissions, and all emoluments
of office whatever shall amou it togeih0i to one thousand dol
larsor upwards per annum anl the different collectors shall
hereafter dischaige the duty of superintendents as heretofore
required without any additional 01 specific compensation for
the performance thereof except as a.bove stated Provided^
That nothing herein contained ¡>hall be construed to impair or
affixt the 18th section of the act approved 7th May, 18¿2, limit
ing the compensation of collectois surveyor, and udvalaifi
cers to thesum of fnur hundred dollars annually/ r services
performed lor the United S ates m any other office or ca
pacity '
Mr FILLMORE modifiM the amendment, by inserting after
the word "dolíais ' in the second line 'and for superiuten
dents' commission*, at 2¿ per cent $4 000 "
Mr RODNfciYsad, even as t it- amendment now stood  )e

Committee of Ways an 1 Means hadfKed the r baids on that
part of the ight hou>esys em w ichnecorsidered in s mdi

were departing fiom the legul rcoutse of pioceejingtostnke
out this provision, which bad existed a id been in full opera
«on since 1739—a period of more than fif y yeais    Th    du y

The gentleman from Indura [M   Pkofht] had =aid these were
trifling servicer    He entertained a very (ilíeicnt o, in ion on the
subject    He had a knowledge   of the^e  serv a. , ar d  ti i
they weievdiuable    The Committee of Ways and Mean ¡j had
their eyes on a few of tho eofficers, whose balane* \\ le veiy
large   but these were very few, and wi h these few $xcep i ns
ofcolectors at Boston iNew "Vork and i few  of the primpal
ports, he doubted very much wh thtr Lheie was my ^ Hector

Delaware, showing theimpoit    ce of the s<nv cesp^foim^d r v
him, and the unjust and oppressive opeiiKn ot this ai íer i
ment if adopted    He thought tie whole thing wa* wiong with
regard to the amendmer t heie piopns*- 1     They were t >ld this
matter was under investiga ¡on and thaf they were to have a
report on the subject    Let them hive it, bat let them not he
gin this subject by piecemeal, and at the most imporurt part of
the system     Did they «¡upoose that if the-v tookaway the «a! a
ríes  these dunes wou'd be performed without compensation'?
Gentlemen said they could get others wh> would pcifoim them,
andso they might   but  this wouJl b   ajoi   economy   wh°"-e

If they wanted the services propel! y performe \ t1 ey nj4 piy
properly for them    If ihi  matter was. undeistood the commit
tee would never be so unjust as to demand services ofsuch ím
portance  without any   compensation  at   all     He  hoped the
amendment would not be adopted    If it were, he hoped the
maximum of compensation would be increased irom $1000
to «2 000
Mr R moved to amend the prov so by increasing thesum
from $ 1,000 to $2,000
Mr R, SALTOJNSrAlLsaid the-e could not benomore ob
jectionable mode of legislating, or passing new laws than be
attaching them to appropriation bills It was objectionable in
otbei respects They had now been seme three, four, or live
weeks on this appropriation bill theie was a great desire to
get through it, and they werenotinadi position to considei
calmlythis subject Ihe ordinaiy comseof legist uion won a
be that the subject should be refei red to a committee thatt ie
committee report, and the repoif he reierre I to the Committee
of the Whole and theie be discussed be on this l\w was
c^ai^ed, as it referred to one of the most essential and impot
t mt establishments m this Government
If this amendment prevailed, the office of collector was
changed, and it would become a fart of hi lufy to it ten! to the
business of superintendent of light h u c^ at the d'■ciet i >t
the Secretary of the Treasury without ?ny additional com
pensation, and the duty would be much more liable to be tie
elected.
In the district ho repiesented, there were more light houses
than in any othei district in the United-States lheiewere
from ten to fifteen, and he would take an occasion to «ay tha
he ft ad never heard the s lghtest complaint concerning the man
Tier of conducting them, except at one light house He cons!
-dered it entirely unreasonable thatduty ofthis great íe^ponsí
bility shonld be thrown on the office of collector without some
additional compensation, and, as an instance where the amen 1
ment would oppeiate in an oppressive manner, he íefeired
to the case ol the collector oí líos on He did not think
they had information enough to justify themselves m mak
mgan alteration in the cusum house system so important as
this                                                             ,
