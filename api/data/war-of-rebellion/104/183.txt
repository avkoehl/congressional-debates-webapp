General Totten is at Starke's Wharf, and requests that you will send all your mortar wagons for the transportation of eight 10-inch mortars just arrived; also one six-mule wagon to transport his baggage and camp equipage, and asks that you will load him a saddle-horse, his own having broken down. Please report when these means of transportation may be expected by General Totten.
