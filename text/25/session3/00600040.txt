THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 18,
mg to the idea he entertained of a babble, it was j
the same thing as the enlargement of this won- i
deiful paper system,promising great things, mag-
nifying credit, blowing it up, and making mag-
nificent fortunes out of nothing, till, in the end, it
is all blown away by the fiistbieath of reality that
touches it
The question was then taken, and the motion
to refer the petition was lost
Mr BUCHANAN then moved to lay it on the
table, which motion was carried
PAPERS WITHDRAWN AND REFERRED
On motion of Mr. TIPTON, it was
Ordered, That the papers of John Kennedy, on the files
of the list session, be referred to the Committee on Private
Land Claims
On motion of Mr. FULTON, it was
Ordered, That the pipers of James Erwtn, on the files of
the la«t session, be igam referred to the Committee on in
dian Affairs
REPORTS FROM A COMMITTEE.
Mr. WRIGHT, from the Committee on Fi-
nance, to which was referred the memoual of the
piesident and directors of the Philadelphia, Wil-
mington, and Baltimore Raihoad Company, for
the lefundmg of certain duties on railroad iron,
reported a bill for that puipose, which was read,
and ordered to a second leading
Mi W also, fiom the same committee, report-
ed a bill for the relief of Zephamah Spiggot and
James De Krafit, which was read, and oidered to
a second leading
Mr W also, from the same committee, to
which had been refoired the bill making appro-
priations, in patt,insuppoitofGovernm< ntfoi the
year 1838-39, repoited the same without amend-
ment
Mr W stited that, as this bill was one of
some importance, and as a speedy action was
somewhat occessaiy, he would move to consider
It at once
The bill was «ccoidmgly taken up in Commit-
tee of the Whole, when
Mr WALL moved to amend it by inserting at
the bottom of the bill, " and foi the Rtvolution-
ary pensions, under the act of the 7th Jfily, 1838,
the sum of $,250,000 "
Mr BENTON lose to object to the insertion
ol an appropriation for an obitit which ought to
be provided for m a bill of its own, in one of the
ordinary appiopiiation bills foi utirymg on the
operations of the Government He objected to
this heavy appiopnation being slipped through in
this mamiei, without notice, mid almost without
the knowledge of the Senate litre was an ap-
propriation of between two and three hunched
thousand dollars foi an object that had cieptmto
the legislation of Congiess almost without the
notice of any one there, and by the time the
estimates on which it was founded were earned
through, the amount would swill up to two or
three millions It was worth while for Senators
to look back and observe how and in what man-
ner this pension system had giown up to us pus*
ent enormous magnitude. In looking at the pen-
sion laws, it would be found that theie were
forty-one thousand souls receiving moni y ft om tin
Treasury for which they were rendu mg no set vice
whatever The whole was given undi i the as-
sumption that an equivalí nt in p< rsonal buvh os
had Been rendered toi it during the n volutiormiy
war, during the late war with Gnat Bntaui.oi in
some of the Indian wais, and if it wa« only to
those who received their pensions as survivoisof
the Revolution, or who had served meritoriously
jn any of our Wars, he would be the 1 ist man who
would object to giving them Butheappreheiided
the pension system had extended itself tar beyond
these cases He did not know if we hud yet taken
the second step of making pensions hereditary, as
it was in Europe, by giving them to the childicn
of those who were supposed to be entitled to them,
but he recollected that, at the last session, an ap
pea! was made to them to give pensions to Euro-
pean castes of hereditaiydescent,and m another
case an application was made by an individual of
seventy years of age, who claimed to be the or-
phan of a revolutionary soldier He did not know
if they had yet taken the second step in the pen-
sion system, by making pensions heieditary, but
it was enough foi his piesentpuipose to say that
the pension list had swelled up to the enormous
amount of forty-one thousand souls, and he un-
dertook to say that there was not a country on
the face of the globe who had such a number of
persons, in propoition to her population and re-
sources, living on the labor of others, without ren-
dering any kind of service whatevei, but under the
assumption that they had rendered service in for-
mer times The pension list under Washington's
administration amounted to only $200,000, and,
even after the Indian wars of Wayne and St Clair,
it had only increased toaboutthroehundied thou-
sand dolíais After the late war with Great Brit-
ain, a proposition was made to provide for those
survivors of the Revolution who needed the aid
of their country That proposition was not ob-
jected to, and $200,000 was deemed amply suffi-
cient for that purpose. It was urged, on the pas-
sage of the law thus biought forward, that the
amount necessary to provide for these veterans
of the Revolution would only be required for a
few years, and that that amount would diminish
yearly
How mistaken had all these assumptions proved'
They had seen the appropi lations swell up to four
or five millions, instead of two or three hundred
thousand, and the list, instead of diminishing, as
predicted, swell up to an army of over forty thou-
sand In addition to all this, by some turn of
phraseology given to the law of the last session,
and which no one heeded at the time, a gap was
made requiring two or three millions more to stop
If he stood alone, and in such a position, he was
willing to stand alone; he would vote against this
appropriation coming into this bill, which was for
canymgon the opeiations of the Government
Yes, sn, (said Mi B ,) forty-one thousand per-
sons, and foui or five millions—as much as the
whole annuil expense, of the Fedenl Government
undei the administration of Genua! Washington
—was now íequned to pension them, while this
Administration and its friends were daily stigma-
tized with thechargeof extravagance Who could
have thought,when some s( eminqly ti ifhng verbal
alteration was, made in the net of the last session
that we should now have the estimates swelled
up some two or three millions' In England, it
was said that a pensionei never dies, and it is said
so because the pension is hereditary, and goes to
the descendants for one life, two lives, m three
lives, ns the case may In Sir, it seems that with
us tin y not only never dit, but they moreascand
multiply He htard tint when the estimate of
j)iJ00,0U0 was made as the amount sufficient to
providi for the sumvois of tht Revolution, the
complaint was made of the small sum that was
to be expended on such lrileusting objects, and
that a member of the other House in the enthu-
siasm of his gratitude, exclaimed, " Soldieis of
the Revolution, may you live foic\ei "' On that
occasion, some gentleman proposed, as a com-
piomise, that they should live foi nine hundred
and iiincty-nini yeais Now, it seemed that this
compiomise had been earned into effect Accoid-
mg to the estimates made by those persons who
nlcnlate the msmances on lives, the amount of
(hi nnlitaiy popuhtion fifty yiaisago, which had
fuinislud foityom thousmd Miiwvors, must
havi hi en millions For this mimbei of suiviv-
oi s Genera! Washington must have had an army
equal to that of Xertes when he crossed the Hell-
espont
Sti, it is time for us to stop and consider what
we are about So fir as there are real survivors
of the R< volution, who rendered service to their
count!y and need Us aid, he would cheerfully
coiitubute for then suppoit, but to undertake to
make him in heve that sueh a pension list was
founded on anything moie than an imposition on
the sensibilities of the nation, was an undertaking
worthy only of the giaduates of the college of
Laputa
Mr HUBBARD remaiked, that as a fuend to
the object winch the Senator from New Jersey
had in view, he felt constiamed to make an ap-
peal to him to withdraw his amendment to the
appiopriation bill which had passed the House
of Representatives,and which had been,repoited
to the Senate this morning from the Committee
on Finance It was necessary that this bill should
pat>s, and pass without delay He had no doubt
that, at this moment, there were no means now
provided by law to meet the drafts of the two
Houses of Congiess The amendment proposed
would tend to embanass and delay the passage
of this bill, and the honorable Senator from New-
Jersey must be sensible that it was usual to make
provision for the payment of the pensionéis and
annuitants, under the various acts of Congress,
by a separate and independent bill for that speci-
fic purpose
It had not been customary heretofore to mingle
the appropriations for the payment of pensione s
with appropi lations for any othci object He was
prepaicd to give his vote for cariymg into fud
effect the act of July last But if the merits of
that bill were at this late peiiod to be debated on
a proposition to make the necessary appropna
tions for executing that act, he bhould much pie-
fer to discuss the subject, when it should ausp
under a bill independent of all other appropna-
tions He hoped, therefore, that his honorable
friend fiom New Jersey would notuigehis piop-
osition at this time. Let this bill pass unembai-
rassed by any othei appropriations, and he enter-
tained no doubt that shot tly a bill would be brought
forward for the express and avowed purpose of
making the necessai y appropriations for the pay-
ment of pensioners, under the various acts of
Congress Then would be the fit time to test the
merit of the bill of the last session Then would
be the time to see if a majority of the Senate would
vote to withhold the appropuations, and thus
virtually defeat that measure, which is now one
among the public statutes of this Government
When such an opportunity presented, he should
endeavor to show to the Senate that these pension
laws weie not obnoxious to the objections which
had been made against them. He hoped then to
be able to satisfy the Senator from Missouri that
even the act of the last session, which íeceived
his most undissembled approbition, ought now
to be earned into full effect, and that the nppro-
puations for thit purpose should not be with-
held But he was suie that enough had aheady
tianspired to satisfy his honorable fuend from
New Jersey that this is not the fit time, noi is this
the propei occasion to bung hefoie the Senate,
thus incidentally, the incuts of the act of trie last
session He hoped that the Senator would with-
diaw his proposed amendment, and peimit the
bill to pa'-s without objection, but should the
Senator decline so to do, lit should ceitainly not
only vote for his imendmei t, but he would en-
deavor to leply to some of the suggestions of the
honorable Senator from Missoun
Mi WALL was not disposed to occupy the
time of the Senate m reply to the honorable Sen-
ator from Missouri How he has filien into such
an erior in lelation to a law upon our statute-
book, and embracing that occasion to denounce
the pension system, he could not imagine This
law was passed at the last session, but we made
no appropnation to meet it, we come back here,
and the first thing we do is to take cue of oui-
selves We cannot retrace our steps in tnis mat-
ter. The law is already passed, one thousand
applicants have already received their certificates;
and we owe it to ourselves, to our country, to the
pensioners themselves, to pass this amendment
as an act of sheer justice We have passed the
law, and justice requires that we should make
appropriations to meet it
Mr DAVIS expressed his gratification at the
refusal of the Senator from New Jersey [Mr
Wali,] to withdraw the amendment, and said
that, it he had done so, he would have lenewed it
himself Those who had received certificates
under the act of the last session were entitled to
their pensions, and could not be depuved of them,
and as the time when these ceitificates would be
duo was drawing near, he thought it very proper
that piovision should be r.iadeior them in this bill.
Mi D madeafew remarks defending the pen-
sion system generally, and the act of the last
session m particular, and denied that our pension
list was at all assimilated tothatof Great Britain,
where persons were pensioned who had lendeied
no service to their country He asked if those
who fought and bled through the war of the Rev-
olution were to be compared with those who
weie put m the Red Book of Gieat Britain with-
out any merit of their own, and were their wounds
to be no mo'e regarded than the hereditary claims
of the British pensioner >
Mr D , after commenting on the rneiits and
services of the soldiers of the Revolution, and re-
ferring to the depreciated funds in which they
were paid,"asked for the yeas and nays on the
amendment, which were accordingly ordered
