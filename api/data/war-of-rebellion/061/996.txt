HEADQUARTERS CENTRAL DISTRICT OF MISSOURI,Warrensburg, June 30, 1864.

I have the honor to transmit for the information of the major-general commanding a tabular statement of the reports of scouts and skirmishes as a part of the regular tri-monthly supplementary report from the 10th to 19th of June, 1864, being the summary of thirty-two reports, in which there were ten affairs with the enemy, in which they lost in killed and mortally wounded 27 men, 7 horses, and wounded, 1 horse and 2 revolvers, 2 wagons burned, and 12 mules killed. The scouts have marched 3,810 miles (a part of which was on foot) in the ten days. I sent this down as one of our dark seasons, the guerrillas having ambuscaded one small scouting party and one escort party, by which we lost 21 men, but as they are the only cases that have occurred in several months, and as our troops have successfully surprised the guerrillas in numerous instances, it takes away in a measure the mortification of these two successes on their part.

I regret to say that in one instance the loss was in a great measure due to the negligence of the corporal who was in command, through which the lives of the men instructed to his charge have been wantonly sacrificed. The escort and guard duty is very large, as forage has to be hauled from 35 to 50 miles for one-halt of the command and in consequence of the number of depots for stores and prisoners.

I am, very truly, your obedient servant,

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
