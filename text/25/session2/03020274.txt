Hi
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
dclohia and Liverpool packets had been captuied
a^hnost within sight ot one oi your greatest com
niercial seaports This showed that such a cap
ture might have tafeen place, and was a sufficient
evidence that this squadron was necessary for our
defence, as well a*, for the protection of our vessels
in time of storms, and for ascertaining all the
shoals and breakers, and dangerous places which
might now not be known Oar own coast has
never been properly surveyed and examined It is
a fa t well known, that the British Admiralty now
know more about the waters of the Chesapeake bay
than the officers ot our own navy do Then, if
the House concurred vvith him in this conversion
which he proposed, the expenditure made by this
bill will not be wasted, and he lelt confident that
the chairman ot ihe Committee ot Ways and
Means would agree with him that tin" squadion
■h ould afford a bettei school for our navy officers
ihan the Exploring Expedition, because they could
be changed at short intervals, and many more
could be brought into it, than could be into die
other expedition
He was opposed to this exped tion foi many rea-
sons, but mainly becanse, by the piesent organiza-
tion of the Navy Department, to bay nothing of the
incompetence of the head of it, there was no hope
ot carrying out any great measure whatever The
responsibility of that Department was divided be-
tween the Secretary and the Navy Commissioners,
and where this was the case, nothing could be done
as it ought to be done
Mr REED did not eoncur with the gentleman
from Virginia in his «ffort which he was about to
mike to d'stroy the Exploring Expedition He
agieed there was gieat necessity for a coast squad-
ron, but ve believed we had plenty of vessels and
office! s to have that and the Exploring Expedition
aI«o, and he looked upon it as being as impoitanl to
commerce that we should kave survejs made m
distant seas as upon oui own coast, because om
vessels tiaversed tvery -tea, ana went upon eveny
coast.
Mr MONTGOMERY did nut concur with the
gentleman from Virginia in casting censure upon
the Head of the Navy Department He did not
stand there the advocate ot any man, but it was
far fiom him to cast censure on anyone He was
in favor of a squadron being placed upon our own
coast, for the purpose of making «urveys, whethci
they weie north or south, and had always voted
foi these objects, but he was opposed to this scheme
of sending a part of our navy into the South Seas
for the purpose of making surveys and explica-
tions, while our own cna«ts were but little known
by many of the officers of our navy.
He apprehended that the Secretaiy of the Navy
would be found to be more fiee from blame,
when all the facts were known in relation to this
matter, than the gentleman from Virginia was
aware of, and hoped no censure might be cast upon
that officer until the circumstances m relation to
this expedition were all brought to the notice of
the Houv
Mr M concluded by moving to recommit the
bill to the Committee of Ways and Means, with
instructions to stake out the item for the Explor-
ing Expedition
Mt MERCER was opposed to the scheme which
.he gentleman from Virginia proposed, to break up
thisExplonng Expedit on, andhopedit would not be
agreed lp, when brought before the House He
expected much from this expedition, was opposed
to having it broken u" in this waj, when it was
nearly ready to sail, and considered it to be the duly
of thus country, it being the second commercial
country in the world, to add its quota to the rause
of science which he thought would be dona by tins
i leans He looked upon it as being quite as ne-
<v ss,aiy t have a knowledge of distant seas as of
, ,r own waters, and agreed with the gentleman
A om Mas  ichusetts, that we might have a squadron
oi. our coast   without interfering with this other
Aft WISE considered that we ought to put our
b  ,m a respectable footing at home, before we
w«i. afcwsd <sr> ?n expedition of this kind He
thought weo^gM first to make the officers of our
isas f awutuoW «ítíj W own coast, and he be-
lieved it to be a fact, that theie was not a single
lieutenant n it who could pilot a man-of-war into
cm of our ow n ports He con ndered it would be
necessary to make this appropriation in any event,
becaust u provided money to pay these officers,
and ihev would have to be paid whethei they went
abroad 01 not He hoped, however, with that
y ipw, that tliM bill might he over until we had some
action on the proposition he had referred to
On motion of Mr WISE,
The House then adjourned
