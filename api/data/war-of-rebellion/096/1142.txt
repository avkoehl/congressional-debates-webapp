RICHMOND, January 26, 1865.

General B. BRAGG:

The bill creating generalissimo was approved 23rd. It repeals the law allowing staff and clerks to a general assigned. My position and others similar need immediate action. If practicable I suggest necessity of your presence to turn over office and books. I cannot easily carry away your and my baggage without help of a servant. Holiday wants to join you; he is excellent.

JNO. B. SALE,

Military Secretary.

ANDERSON, [January] 26, 1865.

Colonel A. ANDERSON:

I have inspected the line of earth-works from Fort Anderson to Orton Pond. It is thoroughly repaired but bad in design. The other line has not yet been commenced. The works of the fort are being strengthened; only sixty shovels in use.

G. T. GORDON,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Inspector-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA, Wilmington, January 26, 1865.

T. D. WALKER, Esq.,President Wilmington and Manchester Railroad Company:

SIR: I would suggest that you should make arrangements for the removal of the machinery belonging to your railroad. Should it become necessary at any time to evacuate Wilmington I could not permit this machinery to fall into the hands of the enemy, but would, in that event, have it destroyed.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
