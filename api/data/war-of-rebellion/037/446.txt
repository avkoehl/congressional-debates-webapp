GENERAL: Herewith I have the honor of inclosing Brigadier General E. S. Dennis' report of the battle of MILLIKEN's Bend, la fought on June 7, together With a list of casualties.

In this battle most of the troops engaged were Africans, who had but little experience in the use of fire-arms. Their conduct is said, however, to have been most gallant, and I doubt not but With good officers they will make good troops.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

Brigadier General LORENZO THOMAS,
