SNYDER'S MILL, January 26, 1863.

Lieutenant General J. C. PEMBERTON,

Comdg. Dept. Of MISS. and E. La.:

GENERAL: Upon examination of the raft, and information received from the person in charge of it, and Mr. Snyder, who has lived here for a number of years, I have concluded that it will be almost impossible to remove the drift from the raft; and that if will not be absolutely necessary to do so unless the Mississippi River should fall very rapidly, which may not be expected for the next four or five months. Mr. Snyder informs me that generally at this stage of the Mississippi River the current runs up in the Yazoo. The drift is not at all packed, and resting mostly against the end of the raft on this side, which rests against the rocks. A boom is now in position, supporting the SECOND raft, and two booms running from it will support the first one, which will greatly add to its strength. More stone should be put in the crib, against which rests the end of the THIRD raft. It will be necessary to blast the rocks to get the stone required. For this purpose, drills should be sent here as soon as possible. I understand they can be had in Vicksburg. Lumber is greatly required here to construct a depot magazine, and to repair the batteries. I shall write to Yazoo City to send down immediately. Up to this, 1. 30 p. m., no negroes or spades have arrived.

I send a little diagram of the raft to show how it is braced.

MAP.

More chains are necessary to secure the lower end of the first raft, and should be sent as soon as possible. I understand the chains can be had in Vicksburg.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant.

W. S. LOVELL,

Lieutenant-Colonel.
