May 3,
England, and all expense of transporting the
articles to this country; that they are taxed
more than the original cost of the article, ex-
clusively for the benefit of the iron manu-
facturer and iron founderies. Not a dollar
goes to the Government, for none is imported
or ever can be under the present duty of 1}
cents per pound. I was misunderstood by the
reporter upon this subject when continually
interrupted last evening. I said the entire'
value ot' all importations of castings, as shown
by the official statement from the Treasury
Departmeut for the year 1869, was but $27,707,
which was less than in 1868. But these im-
portations are not for articles embraced in
Un'se two paragraphs. They are for the arti-
cles included in the third paragraph below,
which come in at 35 per cent, ad valorem.
Talk about a duty to support the Govern-
ment 1 Can you get a duty upon an article
where none ia or can be imported? And yet
the Committee of Ways and Means, after ma-
ture deliberation, hare proposed to raise the
tariff to 1$ cents per pound. Shall debate be
silenced, and the imposition of the present law
be continued by the motions of the chairman
of the Committee of Ways and Means [Mr.
Sciiexck] to strike out the paragraphs, so as
to leave the duty under the present law, which
is now substantially prohibitory? The present
law is not for revenue. It is robbery of the
masses, under the forms of law, for the sole
benefit of a few manufacturers, who or whose
agents are here log-rolling and by combinations
to press through provisions of this bill in their
interest. Again, sir, the whole quantity of
castings of ail kinds, as shown by the Treas-
ury Department, imported in 1860 was but
1,201,4-36 pounds, or about 500 tons. Not a
pound embraced in the paragraph under con-
sideration has been imported or could be. The
whole amouut of castings imported of every
kind is trifling; and there are others, more valu-
able than those enumerated in these para-
graphs, which undoubtedly make up the amount
imported, and which are not embraced in these
two paragraphs.
But assuming that the 600 tons of cast-
ings imported were all of the articles named
in the paragraphs under consideration, the duty
which the Government received under the
present law, at 1} cents per pound, amounts
to $33 60 per ton, and on O00 tons to $16,800.
Suppose the amount required for use annually
in the United States for stoves, &c., under the
paragraph above to be 100,000 tons, which is
less than 30 pounds to each family, supposing
every five persons to compose a family in a
population of 40,000,000, 500 tons of the
100,000 tons used are imported, and the
Government gets, as we have seen, on that,
$16,800. All the rest is domestic manufac-
ture, which is raised by the tariff to the same
price as that imported, and upon which the
duty is paid. Thus the whole amount used,
domestic and imported, being 100,000 tons,
is increased in value $33 60 per ton, which
amounts on the 100,000 tons used to $3,360,-
000. The people pay this latter amount on
account of the tariff. Every dollar that has
gone into the Treasury on account of the tariff
is on what is imported, which, as we have
seen, is $16,800. In other words, according
to this system, the people pay just $200 to
get $1 into the Treasury.
This estimate does not include the st&tm,
gas, and water pipe in the pending paragraph,
which is used so extensively for gas and water
pipe in all our villages and cities, and steam-
pipe for all your Rteam-worirs and steamboats,
as to which it is clear hone can be imported,
and all the increased price occasioned by the
tariff goes to the iron manufacturers.
I oppose the principle of these high tariffs
Jiecause it is anti-Democratic, because it is
egislation for a class at the expense of the
many. I oppose it because of its tendency
to combine Wealth to influence and corrupt
legislation. The manufacturers understand all
about these protective tariffs. If the people
will not examine and understand it, they must
suffer for their own want of attention.
Mr. SCHENCK. The gentleman from New
York talks about " log-rolling," and says that
not a pound of these articles has been imported
and not a dollar of revenue has been derived
from them. We have had that repeated four
times at least. If the gentleman will look at
the Treasury returns he will find that between
$20,000 and $30,000 worth of duty was derived
from these very articles.
Mr. GRISWOLD. How much on each
article ?•
Mr. SCHENCK. I am dealing with the gen-
tleman's statements for the information of the
House. Not a single pouud has been imported
and not a dollar of revenue has been derived.
That is the gentleman's statement.
Mr. GRISWOLD. I wish to call the gentlo*
man's attention to a fact 
Mr. SCHENCK. Notnow. In 1868 on cast-
iron pipes, vessels, stoves, fcnd stove plates we
received a duty of $22,935 90. That is all the
reply I have to make to such an assertion as
that.
Mr. GRISWOLD. How much on stove
plates?
Mr. SCHENCK. I cannot tell about that
any more than the gentleman can. They are
all in the same item in the present tariff. They
are retained in the same classification in this
bill. There is no distinction made between
them in any returns which have come to the
knowledge of the committee. I have answered
the gentleman so far as the figures are con-
cerned. The present duty is 1}, and I think
myself it is too high to raise it to 1| cents,
aud therefore I propose to strike out the para-
graph and leave the duty undisturbed. So far
as the receipts are concerned, let me say to the
gentleman I do not believe it matters whether
there is a duty on that article. The American
manufacturers can beat the world in cast-iron
stoves.
Mr. GRISWOLD. What, then, is the neces-
sity of having duty on them ?
Mr. SCHENCK. It is not necessary in that
view of iU I have not interrupted the gentle-
man.
Mr. GRISWOLD. I wish to be perfectly
informed if I am correct in my statement.
Mr. SCHEN CK. The only reply I make to
the gentleman is the return from the custom-
houses.
Mr. GRISWOLD. Is not the entire im-
portation of all kinds ofcast iron onlv $27,000?
Mr. SCHENCK. About that.
Mr. GRISWOLD. If the gentleman will
look at the subsequent paragraph he will see
there is a duty of 35 per cent, ad valorem on
all other castings of iron not otherwise pro-
vided for. Is not the whole amount imported
in 1869 about 500 tons? There are 40,000,000
people in the United States, and 8,000,000 fam-
lies; and thirty pounds of this cast iron for
stoves, cooking utensils, &ft., for each family
will not amount to over $100,000. Now, sir,
you can see what proportion it is that is used,
and on which the people pay this additional
tariff for the purpose of giving the Government
a duty upon 500 tons.
Mr. SCHENCK. I would just say that if
these articles are manufactured hero in great
quantities and not imported, and if the compe-
tition in the manufacture brings down the price,
as I know it does, to a very low figure, thepeo-
pl6 are not taxed ita the itHf the gentleman
speaks of.
The CHAIRMAN. Debate oh the amend-
ment is exhausted.
Mr. GRISWOLD. With the^Onsent of the
committee, I Would ftsk the chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means one question.
I would ask him how much of the steam, gas,
and water pipe has been imported?
Mr. SCHENCK. Th6 gentleinan cannot
distinguish between these articles which are
classified together. The aggregate amount is
given in the reports of the Treasury Depart-
ment, and it is the aggregate amount of duty
I have given.
The question was put on Mr. Guiswold's
amendment; and there were, on a division—
ayes 23, noes 68; no quorum voting.
The CHAIRMAN, under the rule, ordered
tellers; and appointed Mr. Griswold and Mr.
Kelley.
The committee again divided ; and the tellers
reported—ayes 41, noes 74.
So the amendment was not agreed to.
The question recurred on the motion of Mr.
Sciienck, to strike out the paragraph.
The question was put; and the motion was
agreed to.
The Clerk read as follows:
On all castings of iron not otherwise provided for,
35 per cent, ad valorem.
Mr. SCHENCK. I move to strike out that
paragraph.
The motion Was agreed to.
The Clerk read as follows:
On all cast iton. or other description of steel, in
ingots, blooms, or billets, and on rolled orharamered
steel in bars, rods, sheets, slabs, plates, bands, coils,
or strips, 3i cents per pound.
Mr. A8PER. I move to amend the para-
graph by striking out "3^ cents" and insert-
ing "2 cents." Mr. Chairman, -I desire to
submit the following tabular statement, show-
ing the quantity of steel imported into the
United States in 1869, other than steel rails,
the classification of the same for duty, the value
of the same per pound, the duty on the same
per pound, the gross amount of duty collected,
and the ad Valorem rate of duty on the several
qualities:

This table shotfs what the importation of
Steel was in 1869. It shows that the importa-
tion of the class of steel payingunder the exist-
ing rates 2.} cents per pound was 25,626j988
pounds, against 19,342,398 pounds of all the
other descriptions of steel. That is a descrip-
tion of Bteel which costs a little more than iron,
probably 1 cent more per pound. It costs in
England $72 per ton. And if the rate of duty
fixed by this paragraph is to prevail, then it will
cost merely for duty in the neighborhood of
$75 or $80, perhaps more, toimportthearticle;
while with the present duty, 2J- cents per pound,
the expense ot importation is $61. Now, Mr.
Chairman, this article enters largely into all the
busindss of life. It makes the tool of the me-
chanic. There is Scarcely an enterprise to Which
it is not essentially necessary. Under these cir-
cumstances it seems to me that the duty as
now proposed is too high. Previous to the
war, up to the year 1861, the duty upon this
artiole was 12 per cent, ad valorem. Under
that rate of duty the manufacturers of steel in
this country flourished and were successful, as
in their memorial to Congress in 18G7 they
themselves expressly declared. In l861 there
was a duty imposed which was said to be a
compromise between the importer aud the
