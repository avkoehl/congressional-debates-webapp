into the United States Treasury on or before the last
day of June in the year to which such payment
related, and ten per cent, on the amounts actually
paid between that date and the last day of Septem-
ber in each year to which such payment related.
A subsequent act, approved May 13,1862, provides
foi the deduction of fifteen per cent, on claims pre-
sented to the United States Treasury Department
for the liquidation of said tax, on or before the 30th
of July, 1862.
The act of August 5.1861, makes it the duty of the
Secretary of the Treasury to collect all or any part
of this tax, in case any State, &c., fails to pay the
same after giving notice of assumption, the same as
though no such notice of assumption had been
given.
Again it provides " that should any of the people
of any oftheStates or Territories of the United States
or the District of Columbia, be in actual rebellion
against the authority of the Government of the Uni-
ted States, at the time this actgoes into operation, so
that the laws of the United States cannot be executed
therein, it shall be the duty of the President, and he
is hereby authorized, to proceed to execute the pro-
visions of this act within the limits of such State or
Territory or District of Columbia, so soon as the
authority of the United States therein is reestab-
lished. and to collect the sums which would have
been due from the persons residing or holding
properly or stocks therein, with the interest due, at
the rate of six per cent, per annum thereon until
paid, in the manner and under the regulations pre-
scribed in the foregoing sections of this act.'
Most of the northern States and Territories form-
ally assumed payment of their respective quotas
and gave notice of their intention to pay the same.
Some of them have liquidated the amounts charged
against them in full, some only in part, while others
have neglected to pay any part of their quota.
in consequence of some of the States being in in-
surrection, and a prospeot of too long a delay of
proceedings under the provisions of this act, Con-
gress, by an act approved June 7,1862, provided fer
the collection of this tux in the insurrectionary
btates by and through United States direot tax
commissioners.
In pursuance of the provisions of this new act
commissioners were appointed for each of the eleven
insurrectionary States, gp assess and collect this
tax, which it was provided should be charged against
the lands and collected from the owners thcroof,
with an addition of fifty per cent, penalty to the
amount of tax charged against each tract or lot.
This tax, according to the original actwastohave
been an annual tax, but Congress by an act ap-
proved July 1, 1862, limited the collections to one
annual tax until April 1, 1865, and by an act ap-
proved Juno 30, 1804, limited it to one year, until
further legislation.
While the tax commissioners, appointed under the
act of June 7,1862, were actively engaged in making
assessments and collecting this tax, and had already
collected about ono half of the total amount appor-
tioned to these eleven States, Congress, by an act
approved Ju y 28,1866, authorized the suspension
of further collection in these States until January 1,
1868, and collections were forthwith suspended by
order of the Secretary of the Treasury.
The time specified in the act expired, but the col-
lections were not resumed; meanwhile most of the
commissioners had been relieved from duty.
Again, Congress by an act approved July 23,1868,
provided for the further suspension of the collection
of this tax in these States until January 1, 1869;
since which no action has been taken by Congress
further suspending said collections, nor have collec-
tions been resumed in any of these States.
In pursuanco of the provisions of the act of June
7,1862, (ho tax commissionersseizcd a large quantity
of lands in some of tho States and sold tho same for
non-payment of tho taxes charged against them;
considerable of this land was bid in by tho commis-
sioners for the Uiuted*States, and has nevor been
rodeomed, to which I will hereinafter refer more
specifically.

The propriety of arranging the data relative to the
late insurrectionary States is obvious from the fact
that an entirely different method of collections was
adopted whereby the amounts collected were charged
against separate tracts or lots of land in the sevoral
States, and the amounts uncollected are charged
against the tracts or lots of land upon which tbe tax
has not been paid.
Again, the amount of tax, &c., collected, and the
amount due fromtheseStates, is given with approx-
imate accuracy.
Sales of lands for non-payment of'the taxes
charged against them were mode by the commis-
sioners, from which the following approximate
amounts, as proceeds thereof, have been received:
Virginia, proceeds of sales amounting to..$113,130 57
South Carolina, proceeds of salesamount-
ing to  370,000 00
Florida, proceeds of salos amounting to... 64,705 87
Arkansas, proceeds of sales amounting
to  48,067 24
Tennessee, proceeds of sales amounting
to  101,970 52
Lands were hid in by the commissioners at those
sales for the United States, still unredeemed, with
the following valuations;
In Virginia;
By the assessment of 1860 valued at  $75,000
In South Carolina:
Bv estimates of the late commissioners  300,000
In Florida:
By the assessment of 1860  25,000
In Tennessee:
By the assessment of I860..  309,000
Making a total of. .$709,000
In Tennessee the lands have been very much im-
proved, and I am informed that the present valua-
tion of the lands owned by the United States under
the direct-tax law in that State will exceed $1,000,000.
For several years after the suspension of the col-
lection of these taxes, the lands which had been bid
in for and still owned by the United States seemed
to be lost sight of, cxcept in South Carolina, where
the commissioners were retained until October 31,
1870. The result is that parties took possession, as-
sumed ownership, and conveyed formal titles, and
parties now in possession, when notified to surrender
possession to the United States, allego that "they
were innocentpurehasera, ignorant of the fact that
