Brigadier General S. M. BARTON,

Commanding Fourth Brigade:

GENERAL: Telegraphic dispatches from General Leadbetter give the assurance that the enemy will attack Chattanooga in force. The major-general wishes that his repulse shall be prompt and decisive, and therefore directs that you push forward your brigade to the terminus of the Kentucky Railroad. You will send forward a courier, giving information in advance of your arrival, that transportation at that point may be ready to take your command to Chattanooga. You will leave the smallest detachment (a regiment or battalion) of your command at Clinton, which, with a cavalry force, will be sufficient to watch the approaches from that quarter.

H. L. CLAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
