FORT DUNCAN, July 5, 1864.

Captain H. M. BURLEIGH,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: The lookout from the mortar battery just reports that the rebels are planting a masked battery on Loundon Heights, to the left of 30-pounder battery. Probably they came down the Hillsborough road. I have the 30-pounder battery to open on it in the morning a little while, if it is still there. He also reports that the rebels tried to cross the pontoon to-day, and would have done so had it not been for our sharpshooters. Is there a good support at this end of the bridge?

Respectfully,

G. F. MERRIAN.
