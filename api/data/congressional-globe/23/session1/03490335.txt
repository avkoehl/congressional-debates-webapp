' law, prescribing the mode of selection, the securi
* íes to be taken and the manner and teims on which
' they are to be employed," the com rnttee deemed
l' proper, m a measure ot s ) much imiortince, to
ascertain from the becretaiy of the Treasury his
opinion and views, in regard to the regulations
proper to be adopte 1 in the e-noloynent of the
State bank as the depositories ot th** public mrney,
and the fi&cal agents of the Go1 emrr ent, and aUo
for his views n reg ird to tne probable effects which
would be produced upon the currency by such reg
ulatnns They ace >rdmgly andiessed a letter ti
the Secietary, leq testing to be fun ished *uh the
information desired, and herewith ieport the an-
sv ei which has been received
In determining upon the mode in which the de-
posite banks shall be selected, the committee are
of opinion that a due íegard to the public indi-
cts will make it proper to leave the se ection, in
the first instance, to the head of tne Tiea--ury De
pal tment, or to some o her per or designated by
law, but when once selected, to put it out of the
power of the Executive to discontinue such  de
pository without the sanction and appiobation of
Congress     Should it, however, be deemed expe
dient for Congress the nselves to desig"ate by iw
the banks which shall heieafter be employed is de
posi'ones, instead of delegatn g the power of selec-
tion, in the fast instance, to an executive officer,
there could be no oLject on to thatmoue, piovided
it be deemed practicable to make the selection in
such manner as to p otect ai d preseive the public
funds to Le deposited theiein
The bill which they report piesunbes, fu^t, the
mode in which, and by whom, the State banl t-
hereaf'=i to be employed as the public deposito
ríes shall be selec ed, secondly, the terms a id con
ditions u[on which they shall be empoyeu, the
duties and seivires they shall perfoim, and the
securities which they may be lequiied to give, in
order effectually topiotect the Government against
possible danger of loss, and thirdly, it pnudes
that when once selected, they shall be placed be-
yond the power and control ot tne executive de
partment, except as far as the safe and piudent
management of the public revenue may lender such j
control indispensable
The bill resti icts the discretion of the Executive,
and places it out of the power of that depai tment
to discontinue the selected banks is placa ot pub
lie deposite to cases of failure on the pait of sa d
banks to comply with the terms and conditions on
which they may be employed, oi to cases in whicn
any of said banks may become unsafe depositones
of the publ c money, and res°i ves to Congi eso t le
uiti""ate control over the whole «ub,ect     By i s
provisions the Secietary of the Tieasury cam ot
during the session of Congress dismiss i rom  ti e
seivice of theTieasury any bank of deposi ewith   I
out having fiict obtau ed the sanction and appio
bation of Congiess, and if during the recess of !
Congress any bank shall fan oi refuse to comply
with the terms and conditions u¡ on which it has
been employed, or, lf.from the penodical i emirs
of its condition and business, or otheiw se, the
Secietary of the Treasury shall deem it necessaiy,
in ordei to protect and preserve the public interest,
to discontinue any of said banks as public deposi-
tones, he is authorized to issue such oideV tern- ¡
piranly, but is required at the commencement of
the next session to ieport iO Congress the reasons
and the evidence upon whicn he has oidered such
discontinuance, reserving to Congress the light to I
approve or reveise such order     Thus all appie
hension that the power of the Executive ovet the
selected  banks may be used as a governmental I
patronage oi for corrupt purposes, is effectually
íemoved     So long as the selected banks shal1 con-
tinue to perform the duties íequned of them bv the '
piovisions ot the "bill, (should it become a law )
so I ing as they shall continue so to co itluct their
b  siness as t5  keep the oubhc funds deposited
theiein secure, they canno   be discontinued at the
will of the Executive, but will be entitled to their
custody as matter ol right, unles   it shall be the
pleasuie of Congre s to wuhdiaw them, or change
the place of íle¡ osite

Tiea^ury in ihe v ews which he had presented in .

sm
m their place This may, doubtless, to some ex
tent, be encouraged and effected through thecollec
tion and management of the revenue Congress
possesses no power to restricttheState institutions
lrom issuing sma 1 notes, but they have the power
to impose as a condition upon wn en any bank
shall be employed as adenci ory, tnatit shall hrtt
stipulate not to issue or use, after a given future
day, not s of the smaller denominat ons, in the
course of its business, and they have a n«ht to
refuse to receive in payment to the United Stat s
the notes c f any bank which shall not cej«e, aftfi
a given futuie day, to issue small notes The lull,
accordingly, contains a mov sion to this effect,
designed to induce the State 1 anus tocto leiatem
banishing from circulation all notes of a less de
nomination than five dolíais, after a given future
day In several ¡states such a prohibition already

Sir I have the honoi t> ht¿i owledge tl e le
cop if join letfi < f the 7 h n tint, and proceed
to leply to me inquines maue by the Committee
of Ways and Means
In my repoit to Congiess at ti e commencement
of the piesttit sess on, assignu j: my rensors foi
"emovirg the depo itas from t'ie Bank of the (Jul
ted Stairs, I exp essed ihe opinion that a cor¡ ora
tion of that descript on was not necessary, eithei
foi the fisci 1 operations of the Government, oi the
generi 1 convenience of the people
One of the aigunents most fiequently urged in
ftvor of the expediency of a B ink of the United
Slates lsthesalutaryinfluence which ltissupposed
to exeit in securing to the countiy a sound cur
lency It is said the Slate banks have a consta it
tendency to ovet issues, and tha' a superior power
is necessaiy to keep them m checrf, and to control
them in this pellicular—t nd tl e argument is con
s'antly and earnestly pressed, that a Bank of the
United States is the fit and appiopnate means to
accomplish this object If theie be ai y force ill
this aigumen ,the r apci cunency fumshed by the
State banks, as well as that issued by the Bank of
the United States, ought now to be in a sound
state
Ihe Bark of the United S ates has been m ex
istence seventeen yeais, and must have airead)
exerted all the influence in relation to t'iecuirency,
whicn can evei be expec ed fiom such an institu
lion And if it exercises a wholesome and salu
taiy contri 1 over the conduct of the State banks,
and restiams them within proper bounds, it has
hi d full ti tie and oppoi un ty to exeit that power,
and the no es of the State banks, as well as those
of the Bark of the United States, oi ght now to
be found in a sale condi ion For it must be ad
mated tiat we have gained but little byehurte ing
ihe Bank ot the United States, ir onty the com
paritively s-na'l poitionof il e paper currency fur
mshei by itself, is sound, while the great mass of
the cuculatmg medium is inheiently vicious, and
liable to be disordered at any moment     It is be
lieved that more than three-fourths of the present
paper currency is furnished by the State banks,
and if solaigea portion of our circulating medium
is unsafe and unworthy of credit, then the Bank of
the United States s either incapable of exercising
the salutary control clamed for it, or it has failed
to perfoim its duty to the public In either event
it is time to look for some othei remedy
Judging from the I est information which the de-
partment has been able to obtain, the paper of the
various banks—including tne Bank of the United
States—in ac ual cnculation in ordinary times,
amounts to at least eighty millions of dolíais Of
this s im the Bmk of the United States furnishes
less than twenty millions, and the\arious State
I banks more than sixty millions, the specie in the
vaults of the same banks, to support this extensive
credit, does not probably exceed twenty five mil-
lions
la estimatng the amount of specie, I confine
nyself to thecjin supposed to be in possession" of
the banks In some of the States the circulation
of lank notes beiow five dollars is prohibí ed by
law, and in tl ese States there is a considerable
amount of specie passing from hand to hand, and
forming a paitof the oidinai y circulating medium
It does not, however, probably exceed four mil-
lions of dolíais This metallic arc llation lessens
by so much the amount of paper, and to that ex-
j tent it diminishes the evil occasioned by the great
I disproportion between the paper superstructure
I and its metallic basis But the coin which is thus
cuculatmg cannot be brought in aid of the paper
currency, when a pan c, or any other cause, sud-
denly throws it back upon the bank for ledemp-
ti( n It cannot, theiefoie, be estimated as a part
r f the mea is to secuie the payment of the actual
papei cucohtion It tal es the place of so much
paper in the mass of the Ciieulating medium, and
ti ereby lessens the amount to be redeemed But
it w ill r ev er fii d its way into the banks, when thur
notes are rapidly letuimrg upon them They
must rely upon the amourt actually in then vaults,
and it is with ¡hit. amount that we must compare
ti e paper circulation, in order to decide whether it
is m a safe condition It is evident that the chief
pait of the paper cuirency of the United States
mmt always be furnished by the Slate banks No
Bank of the United S ates could pi ovide a sufficient
anion t foi ihe whole nation, without giving to it
a capita' of such enormous and stai tlmg magnitude,
that no one, it is piesumed, would seuously pro-
pose it
And if Congress are to legislate, with the view
of secunng to the people of the Unit d States a
sound papei cunency, the condition of the notes
oft! e Sta'e banks is of much more importance to
the community tl an that of any Bank of the Uni-
ted States 1 he notes of the different local banks
form theordinary cuculatmg medium for the great
body of our citizens, and it vvould be unjust to
them to disregard its condition The whole cur-
rency of the countiy should be placed in a sound
and healthy s ate, as far a*> the legit mate authority
of the United States will enable them to accomplish
that object
Undo the authority debated to Congress by
theConstuut on of the United States, they have no
power to estabhsh by law a paper currency, and
the influence which they may lawfully exercise in
securing ts soundness is altogether incidental In
legislating withtn the admitted scope of their au-
thority, they may, without assuming powers not
granted, look to the effect whicn their laws will
produce upon an interest of so much importance as
that of tl e paper circulation nuw floating through
the country
Taking tint, view of the suljrct,thefir¡>t inquiry
is, what is the present condition of the ordinary
cuculatmg medium of the United States' Is the
irreat mass of the paper curiency in a sound and
healthy condition' If it is, we must endeavor to
find means to preserve it m its present state, when
the Bank of theUnued Sta'es shall cease to exist
But if it is not, then it is. obvious that the creation
of a Bank of the United States will not accom-
plish thi& desirable object, and that, even on the
score of expediency, without reference to con-
stitutional objectio is, some other plans should be
de\ scd                                         *
If the estimate I have made of the proportion
between the paper circulation and the specie in
