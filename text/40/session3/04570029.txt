ciency and discipline, and the barracks and
public property in their charge well cared for
and in admirable order. A reduction of the
force corresponding to that of the naval service
has been made, and the entire strength of the
corps, officers and men, is now but 2,500. The
marine barracks in Washington, built of indif-
ferent material nearly seventy years ago, are
represented as rapidly crumbling to decay, and
in such a dilapidated condition that it will be
impossible for the troops touch longer to occupy
them. The necessity for the erection of new
barracks, which has been repeatedly urged, is
again respectfully recommended.
COXCLKSIOS.
In this my eighth annual report it is a satis-
faction to state that the year now drawing to
its close has been one of peaceful but active
cruising on the part of the Navy. Our com-
merce and shipping interests, if less extensive
than they were eight years ago, are neverthe-
less as vigilantly guarded and protected.
It has fallen to my" lot to sustain a greater
responsibility, and to have had a much more
eventful and varied as well as a longer experi-
ence in this Department than any one' of my
predecessors. While I claim no exemption
from error, it is a gratifying reflection that the
duties intrusted to me have been acceptably
performed, and that the record which com-
memorates the services and achievements of
our naval heroes also bears evidence, through
a most important period of our country's his-
tory, of a not unsuccessful administration of
our naval affairs.
On this Department, soon after I entered it,'
devolved the task of creating within a brief
period a navy unequaled in some respects, and
without a parallel, of enforcing the most ex-
tensive blockade which was ever established,
of projecting and carrying forward to success-
ful execution immense naval expeditions, of
causingourextensiverivers, almost continental
in their reach, to be actively patrolled; and
finally, after four years of embittered warfare,
of retiring the immense naval armament which
had been promptly called into existence, of dig-
posingtothe commercial marine the vesselspro-
cured from that service, and of reestablishing
our squadrons abroad in the interest of peace.
The waste of war is always great, but much
of the expenditure of the Navy Department,
which is but a small per cent, of the national
war expenses, is invested in navy-yard improve-
ments, which are worth to the Government all
they cost, and in naval vessels and ordnance,
which have at all times an intrinsic value.
When the fact of this large amount of property
on hand, of the return of millions to the Treas-
ury, of the magnitude of the war, of the vast
operations of the Navy, and of the depreciation
of the currency, and the consequently enhanced
prices with which those operations were con-
ducted are considered, the economical and
faithful administration of the Navy Department
will be admitted.
My acknowledgments are due to the gentle-
men who in their several grades have been
associated with me in the discharge of the
laborious and responsible duties of this De-
partment, for the able and efficient service
which they have rendered. In the choice of
my assistants, of the chiefs of the several
bureaus, and of others who have participated
in the civil administration of this Department,
as also in the selection and assignment to duty
in the Navy of the officers whose meritorious
conduct and heroic achievements have illum-
ined our history and given enduring renown
to the Navy, I esteem myself to have been
most fortunate, and I cannot close this report
without expressing towards each my sense of
grateful obligations, and commending them to
the gratitude of the Government and country.

Beport of the Postmaster General.
Post Office Department,
December 3, 1868.
Sib : The ordinary postal revenue for the
year ended the 30th day of June last was
§16,292,600 80, and the expenditures duringthe
| same period, including service for which special
I appropriations were made, $22,730,592 65;
1 showing an excess of expenditures of $6,437,-
991 85.
The receipts from postages, as compared
with the previous year, show an increase of six
per cent., and the expenditures an increase of
eighteen per cent.
The ordinary expenses, not including mail
transportation for which special appropriations
were made, were $21,555,592 65 ; and the
receipts, including the amount drawn under
the acts making appropriations for carrying
"free mail matter," were $20,092,600 80;
showing an excess of expenditures of $1,462,-
991 85.
The receipts of the Department were, from
postages, $16,292,600 80 ; the amounts drawn
from the Treasury under acts making appro-
priations for "carrying free matter," $3,800,-
000; and under the acts making special
appropriations for "overland mail and marine
service between New York and California,"
$1,125,000; " steamship service between San
Francisco, Japan, and China," $125,000 ;
between the "United States and Brazil,"
$150,000; for " carrying the mail on routes
established by acts passed during the first ses-
sion of the Thirty-Ninth Congress," $486,525;
and "for preparing and publishing post route
maps," $10,000; making the receipts from
all sources $21,989,125 80. The expendi-
tures of all kinds were, as above stated,
$22,730,592 65; showing an excess of ex-
penditures over receipts of $741,466 85, for
which a special appropriation will be re-
quired.
The revenue account stated by the Auditor
(see Appendix) differs from the foregoing
because of his adding to the receipts of the
Department, from all sources, a balance of
$1,494,469 98, standing to the credit of the
revenue account July 1, 1867, but whichisnot
immediately available.
The estimates for the current fiscal year, as
submitted to Congress with the last annual
report, showed an anticipated deficiency of
$3,296,000: to meet which there was then in
the Treasury $2,000,000, being the unexpended
balances of former appropriations standing to
the credit of the Department, leaving the
amount to be provided by appropriation from
the general Treasury $1,296,000. Of this sum
Congress appropriated $800,000.
The expenses during the fiscal year just
closed exceeded the estimated amount, espe-
cially in the item of transportation, and thus
absorbed the $2,000,000 relied on to assist in
meeting the anticipated deficiency for the cur-
rent year. The ordinary expenditures for the
current year were also estimated too low, from
the fact that the Department could not, at the
time the estimates were mad«, anticipate the
extraordinary increase of service established
by acts of Congress. Taking those of the last
fiscal year as a basis, it is anticipated that in
the current year there will be a deficiency of
$8,604,500. There will also be required
$97,000 for service on the route from Port
Abererombie to Helena, Montana, authorized
by the act of July 27, 1868, from January
1, 1869, to June 30, 1869; and to meet the in-
creased liabilities of the Department for ser-
vice on the "overland route," $161,000, making
$3,862,500, which will be required to meet
deficiencies iu the receipts for the current fiscal
year.
The accompanying report of the Auditor fully
sets forth the details of the financial operations
of the Department.
ESTIMATES FOE 1870.
The ordinary expenditures for the year ending Jane
SO, 1870, (including 8645,260 for overland and sea
mails to California,) are estimated at 524,540,413
The ordinary revenue is estimated at an
increase of five percent, on that of the
year just elosed, or  .£17,100,000
Add the standing appropriations
for carrying free mail matter... 700,000
Making the total estimated revenue... 17,800,000
Showing an excess of expenditures of. 66,740,413
to be provided for from the general Treasury.
It will also be necessary to make the usual
special appropriations, as follows;
Mail steamship service between San Francisco.
Japan, and China $500,000
Mail steamship service between the United
States and Brazil  150,000
Mail steamship service between San Fran-
cisco and the Sandwieh Islands  75,000
Comparative statements of revenues and expenditures,
exclusive of appropriations for special service, per
capita:
Revenues from postage, &c.,
1850 $5,499,985 00 23 7-10 cents.
Expenditures, 1850  5,212,953 00 22 1-2 cents.
Excess of revenue  1 2-10 cents.
Proportion of revenue to ex-
penditures  105 percent.
Revenues from postages, &e.,
1860. $8,518,067 40 27 1-10 cents.
Expenditures, I860.... 14,874,772 89 47 3-10 cents.
Deficiency of revenne  20 2-iO cents.
Proportion of revenue to ex-
penditures  57 2-lOper cent.
Revenues from postages, kc.,
1868 $16,292,600 80 42 9-10 cents.
Expenditures, 186S.... 21,555,592 65 55 6-10cents.
Deficiency of revenue  12 7-100 cents.
Proportion of revenue to ex-
penditures   76 per cent.
The following are some of the results of
these statements:
First. From 1850 to 1860 the revenue per
unit of population increased 14^ per cent., or
at the rate of 1^% per cent, per year. From
1860 to 1868 the like increase was 58/ff per
cent., or 7I30- per cent, per year.
Hence the annual increase of revenue for the
eight years of the current decade is, per capita,
about five times greater than the same annual
increase of the preceding decade.
Second. From 1850 to 1860 the ordinary
expenditures per unit of population increased
110 per cent., or 11 per cent, per year. From
1860 to 1868 the like expenditures increased
17| per cent., or 2^ per cent, per year.
Hence the annual per capita increase of
ordinary expenditures for the last eight years
is about five times less than the same annual
increase for the preceding ten years. _
Comparing these two results, relative to the
annual average of the present and preceding
decade, itappears i\ia&,per capita, the revenues
have increased about fivefold, and that the
expenditures have diminished about fivefold.
POSTAGE STAMPS AND STAMPED ENVELOPES.
During theyear, 383,470,500postage stamps,
of the value of $11,751,014, (including

issued. The aggregate value of these issues
was $13,863,124, being an increase of 3j$>
per cent, over the issues of the previous year.
The issue of ordinary postage stamps, as
compared with the previous year, shows^ an
increase in value of 1 ufs per cent; periodical
stamps, per cent.; stamped envelopes,
bearing cards and requests, 53^ per cent;
and the newspaper wrappers, 81^ per cent.
The issue of plain stamped envelopes was 5%
per cent, less than during the year ending 30th
June, 1867; thus showing the preference of
the public for the envelopes denominated
" request" or card envelopes.
The aggregate issue of envelopes was in-
creased duringthe year 14!% per cent, in value.
