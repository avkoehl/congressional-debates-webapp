HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, Tenn., August 23, 1864.

Major-General Burbridge,

J. D. WEBSTER,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., August 23, 1864-1. 30 p. m.

General BURBRIDGE,

Louisville:

I don't believe Wheeler and Morgan are going into Kentucky, but should they you should be prepared for them. Of course I cannot turn back for a cavalry raid. If Colonel Laiboldt held Wheeler at bay with 400 men at Dalton in a redoubt, you surely can hold him in Kentucky with General Ammen and General Tillson at Cumberland Gap and Knoxville. Get your people well in hand, and in no event allow alarm to spread in Kentucky. The enemy cannot spare a large force now to invade Kentucky. It is a raid designed to make clamor and nothing more.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, TENN., August 23, 1864.

Captain J. BATES DICKSON:

Brigadier-General Carter reports from Knoxville that Wheeler's force has crossed the Holston above Strawberry Plains and intends striking the railroad between Nashville and Chattanooga.

J. D. WEBSTER,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND GAP., August 23, 1864.

Captain J. BATES DICKSON:

The rebels have cut communication between here and Knoxville. I had a dispatch from Jacksborough this morning stating that their advance was at Clinton. It is supposed to be Wheeler's command, evidently intending to make a raid through Big Creek Gap into Kentucky, or upon this place; probably the gap from the fact that we have a large amount of supplies and 600 beef-cattle destined for Knoxville.

W. Y. DILLARD,

Colonel.
