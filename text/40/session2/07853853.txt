The motion was agreed to.
DENT, YANTINE & CO.
Mr. WINDOM, from the Committee on
Indian Affairs, reported a bill (H. R. No.
1371) for the relief of Dent, Van tine & Co.,
for provisions furnished to the Indians of
California during the years 1851 and 1852;
which was read a first and second time.
The question was upon ordering the bill to
be engrossed and read a third time.
The bill, which was read, directs the Secre-
tary of the Treasury to pay to Dent, Yantine
k Co., for provisions furnished to the Indians
of Canfo rnia duiing the years 1851 and 1852,
the sum of $25,327 SO, the same to be appro-
priated out of any money in the Treasury not
otherwise appropriated.
Mr. CULLOM. I make the point of order
that this is an appropriation bill, and must
receive its first consideration in the Committee
'of the Whole.
Mr. WINDOM. I hope the gentleman will
not insist upon his point of order.
Mr. CULLOM. This is an old claim; I
insist upon my point of order.
Mr. WINDOM. Because this is an old
claim, aud these parties have been kept out
of what was justly due them all this time, that
is no reason why they should not now be paid.
Mr. CULLOM. 1 insist upon my point of
order.
The bill was accordingly referred to the
Committee of the Whole.
CONTROL OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.
Mr. WINDOM, from the Committee on
Indian Affairs, also reported a bill (H. R.
No. 1375) to transfer to the Department of
the Interior certain powers and duties now
exercised by the Secretary of the Treasury in
connection with Indian affairs; which was
read a first and second time.
The question was upon ordering the bill to
be engrossed and read a third time.
The bill, which was read, provides that the
powers and duties devolving upon the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, under and by virtue of
the fourth section of the act entitled "An act
making appropriations for the current and
contingent expenses of the Indian department,
and for fulfilling treaty stipulations with the
various Indian tribes, for the year ending June
30, 1849, and for other purposes," approved
July 29, 1848, and the powers and duties
devolved upon him under and by virtue of the
laws relating to the investment of moneys in
behalf of the Cherokee Indians from the sales
of land under the treaties concluded at Pon-
totoc, October 20, 1882, and at Washington
city, May 24, 1834, as also all other supervis-
ory and appellate powers and duties in regard
to Indian affairs which may now by law be
vested in the Secretary of the Treasury, shall,
from and after the passage of this act, be exer-
cised and performed by the Secretary of the
Department of the Interior.
Mr. CHANLER. I would inquire of the
gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. \\ indom] in
what stage is the present condition of these
Indian affairs, whether in the handsHif the
military power or the civil power, and whether
this bill relates in any way to the struggle
about this matter now going on between those
two powers ?
Mr. WINDOM. I will state all there is in
this bill as I understand it, aud I think i fully
understand it. By some anomaly the Secretary
of the Treasury now has charge of about fif-
teen hundred Indians in North Carolina,while
the Secretary of the Interior has charge of all
the Indians in every other portion of the Uni-
ted States. I hold in my hand a communica-
tion from the Secretary of the Treasury, ask-
ing that these Indians in North Carolina may
be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Secre-
tary of the Interior. Those two Cabinet offi-
cers have drawn up a bill for the purpose of
accomplishing that result, which bill I have
simply copied, and now report to the House
by the direction of the Committee on Indian
Affairs, who have examined it, and think it
should pass.
Mr. ALLISON. As this bill was read I
noticed something in it in reference to an
investment of the Cherokee trust,fund. I would
ask the gentleman to give the House some
explanation of that matter.
Mr. WINDOM. At the time the Cherokees
were removed from North Carolinia a provision
was made that tho e who remained behind
should have fifty-three dollars each set apart
to them as a permanent fnnd, the interest of
which was to be paid annually. About fifteen
hundred of them remained behind, and they
have been under the charge of the Secretary of
the Treasury, who has been paying to them
the interest on that fund of fifty-three dollars
each. The desire on the part of both the
Interior and the Treasury Department is that
these Indians shall be transferred to where the
others are.
Mr. ALLISON. How are those funds in-
vested ?
Mr. WINDOM. They are simply in the
Treasury of the United States ; they are not in-
vested in bonds at all. We make no provision
with reference to that.
Mr. ALLISON. I would like to ask the
gentleman another questionâ€”whether or not
the Secretary of the Interior can draw upon
this fund under this bill except through the
Secretary of the Treasury? How can he reach
this fund which is set apart?
Mr. WINDOM. He can reach it, I suppose,
as he reaches all other funds that are in the
Treasury of the United States.
Mr. ALLISON. By requisition?
Mr. WINDOM. By requisition.
Mr. MULLINS. Mr. Speaker, it seems that
this treaty whs made twenty or tbirtj years ago
with these Cherokee Indians ; and by the ac-
tion of the Government of the United States,
certain funds were allowed to remain in the
Treasury subject to the order of the Secretary
of the Treasury. This is not a fund to be now
created anew, but it is, as I understand, pro-
posed to draw from the fund that has already
been appropriated years ago for this object.
Itseemsto be now the determination of those
Indians to remove, and to reside with their
fellow Indians who have gone to the country
allotted them in the Indian territory. These
Indians who remained in NorLh Carolina have
been the victims of the most atrocious swin-
dling. Agents have come here pretending to
represent them. One gentleman by the name
of Thomas came here years ago aud drew the
amount due to each Indian and bought some
fifty thousand acres of land and held it in his
own name; and these Indians are now deprived
of every dollar of the interest upon that money,
the property being now levied upon to he sold
for the individual indebtedness of Thomas.
The man has been deranged for two or three
years, and is now, or was recently, in a lunatic
asylum. These Indians do not ask for reim-
bursement of that money ; but they ask this
expenditure out of the interest due to them
upon the appropriation heretofore made, which,
under the contract by the Government, was to
inure to their benefit if they remained in North
Carolina, and they have remained there. I
will say further, that during this dreadful and
bloody rebellion, which is costing this House
so many days of labor in pardoning the men
who were engaged in it, those Indians were
under the stars and stripes of the United States;
and now they come up as the wards of this
Government and ask that this allowance shall
begranted to them out of the original fnnd, so
