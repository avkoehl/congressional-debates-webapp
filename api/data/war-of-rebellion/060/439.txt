HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,January 29, 1864. (Received 12. 45 p. m.)

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I respectfully and earnestly request that the regiments and companies of veteran volunteers furloughed from this army and ordered to report to the superintendent of the recruiting service in their relative States may be directed to return immediately on the expiration of their furloughs. If this is not done I fear it will not be possible to furlough before the season for active operations commences all the re-enlist men now here awaiting furloughs, and those who will re-enlist if they can be furloughed, and unless the men can be promised furloughs it is not probable that we shall have more re-enlistments. More than half the veterans now absent left as three-fourths organizations and are beyond my control.

JOHN SEDGWICK,

Major-General.
