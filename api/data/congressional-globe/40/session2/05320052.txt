Report of the Anting Commissioner of Agriculture.
40tii Cong 2d Sess.
agriculture which has not paid the expenses
of culture must be destructive to all enterprise
and effort in the producer, and yet many a cot-
ton-planter will fail to realize a more cheering
state of facts at the close of the year's opera-
tions; and it will stimulate the efforts of the
British'cotton supply association, which have
increased the India yield by the aid of the war
and our own taxation nearly fourfold in eight
years, and that of Brazil at about the same
rate. Ten years ago the contribution of the
United States to the European supply was
fully four fifths of the total amount; now it is
considerably less than the receipts from other
sources. During ten months of 1867 the im-
ports into Great Britain were as follows:

It is not prob&blc that a monopoly in cotton
production will be regained j nor is it dosirablo
that it siioald. 1 he cotton of this country is
of superior quality, and should bo manu'fac-
largely where it is grown; any surplus
of the raw material would then command re-
munerative prices abroad, and the cotton inter-
^est would still be independent of foreign com-
binations, and far more prosperous than in the
tune when planters made more purchases an-
nually than the proceeds of their cotton would
cover. The factories would make a demand
tor the labor of women and children, and fur-
nish markets which would stimulate a widened
range of agricultural production, making re-
quisite and inevitable a largely increased popu-
lation, and ultimately resulting in larger crops
of cotton than in the boasted days of our cotton
supremacy.
I lie solution of the labor question in the
cotton States is anxiously awaited bv the peo-
V'i ,llie,recent radical change of the system
ot labor has necessarily been attended with
irregularities, espeeialyin the working of large
plantations, and lias led to disappointments
and discouragements; and the operations of
the future will undoubtedly be conducted on a
smaller scale by a larger number of proprie-
tor's, No body of laborers of whatever race
or degree of intelligence, if free to contract
for their own service, can be held in one lo-
cality or one branch of industry or prevented j
from attempts, however weak or unsuccessful,
to assume the part of proprietor. The negroes
of the South have exhibited such restlessness
and evinced a similar ambition to the annoy-
ance of the contractors for their labor; yet in
many cases their employers have accorded to
them a character for stability and industry that
was scarcely to be expected. Time alone will
settle these disturbed conditions ; and patience
and experience in adjustments to new circum-
stances on the part of employers and employes
will aid materially in the settlement.
The introduction of Asiatics to meet the
requirements of cotton production is to be
deprecated, not only because such labor is
unskilled and far inferior to negro labor, but
it will add to the complications produced by
the jealousies and prejudices of races widely
differing in character, taste, and traditional
customs. The assumed disadvantage in the
presence of one inferior race cannot be neu-
tralized by the introduction of another.
As a result of thedoubt relative to the action
of the negro the white man has undertaken
the solution of the labor question, and is suc-
cessfully producing cotton, both by cooperative
and individual enterprises, proving to the world
that the Caucasian can labor without detriment
to health under a southern sun, and laying the
foundation for universal industry and irc.neral
thrift.
There is unexampled activity throughout
this section in search of new branches of pro-
duction, and the fostering care of the Govern-
ment in aiding the acquisition of new fruits,
grasses, and fibers, and in furnishing informa-
tion calculated to facilitate experiments, cor-
rect injurious misapprehensions, and render
these activities successful, will be rewarded by
the return of prosperity to a great section and
in a development that will enrich the country
and astonish the world.
STOCK IMPORTATION,
The cattle-plague, or rinderpest,, having
almost, if not entirely, disappeared in Europe,
it will become necessary to repeal or modify
the law prohibiting the importation of cattle,
no cases having appeared in England for some
weeks, and notice having been given that no
more reports will be made. Stock-growers of
this country desire, after so long a prohibition
of importation, to avail themselves of an op-
portunity for judicious selection of favorite
strains of blood and to secure the result of
recent improvements.
DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS.
The limited appropriations heretofore made
to this Department, have merely enabled it to
inaugurate a plan of operations designed to
further the interests of intelligent husbandry
and protect it in its economic and political
relations with other-industries. Constantly
acumulating evidence of the interest awakened
among farmers in these efforts in behalf of
agriculture attests the vitality and utility of
this branch of the Government service.
Special information, involving scientific, tech-
nical, and practical knowledge, is sought with
great avidity by individuals and associations,
and by directors and promoters of emigration
and official boards of agriculture in foreign
countries, and the monthly and annual reports
arc yearly received with increasing apprecia-
tion.
The system of crop estimates, initiated as an
experiment, and furnishing only approximate
results m the absence of a complete census of
production, have proved sufficiently reliable to
cxcite the ire of speculators, whose purposes
are frequently foiled by their publication. In
the case of cotton, the only product of which
an annual enumeration is attainable, the esti-
mate of last year, of one million eight hundred
and thirty-live thousand bales, was stiikingly
verified.
Great benefits would result from a census by
the General Government, takeu in periods of
five years instead of ten as heretofore; and it
is to be regretted that there is not in each State
a provision for anannua\ census of the princi-
pal farm products, and that in many ot those
States which have taken some action in that-
direction there should be so much neglect and
failure in the enumeration required 011 the part
of local officers, many of whom appear to re-
gard the duty as a labor to be performed or
neglected at pleasure. The schedule,-, to be
