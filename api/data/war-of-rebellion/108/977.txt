General R. E. LEE:

GENERAL: I have just forced the enemy back from my immediate front, capturing eighty prisoners. He still shows infantry and cavalry. I will communicate at once to General Hill and move as you direct, if he can relieve me.

Very respectfully,

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General.

COLONEL: In front of the greater part of my line we have driven the enemy across the Totopotomoy. On my extreme left and General Mahone's right he is still on this side, but I think he will be driven across before dark.

Respectfully,

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,

HUGHES' CROSS-ROADS, June 1, [1864]--7.15 a. m.

[Colonel W. H. TAYLOR:]

COLONEL: Your dispatch of 5 a. m. is just received. I ordered Butler to remain with General Lee for the present, and I will send other troops to the right, if they can be spared. From the inclosed,* just brought, you will see that there is a force in front of General William H. F. Lee. Rosser's brigade is here, ready to move in any direction required. I came here at 5 a. m., as soon as I heard the firing. This inclosed note is the first information I have received. You shall hear further.

I am, respectfully,

WADE HAMPTON,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS,June 1, 1864--2.30 p. m.

MAJOR: Be kind enough to inform General Lee that my command is just in rear of Hoke's right, with pickets and vedettes extending his right. It is impossible whilst the enemy hold Old Cold Harbor to occupy the road from that place via Black Creek Church, &amp;c., as is suggested. My line is therefore along the road from New Cold Harbor
