JAMES ISLAND, July 2, 1862-6.15 p.m.

General PEMBERTON:

Scouts have penetrated to the hedge near Grimball's house. The enemy appears to have disappeared and their pickets gone from that vicinity. Extensive redoubts and intrenched lines are discovered in rear of the large Grimball woods in an unfinished state. There is no one to be seen this side of the marsh near Grimball's. Four boats at Grimball's; a good many at Battery Island. A regiment reported at or near Legare's house. A close reconnaissance has been ordered, and their position will be shelled from Secessionville. As most of them went off from Grimball's in steamers Evans may be able to cut off some who may be crossing from John's Island to-night.

Respectfully,

WM. DUNCAN SMITH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
