Brigadier-General KELLEY,

Grafton, Va.:

The Eighty-seventh Pennsylvania Infantry left Martinsburg last night under orders to proceed to report to you at Grafton. The Twelfth Virginia Infantry will follow, and a battery, being all of Hay's brigade at Winchester. I think it will not necessary to send you more force, but give me frequent reports of the situation. Do you credit the report of a rebel force in Tyler County, or going toward Wheeling? Can they go in there and escape you without being cut off?

Brigadier-General KELLEY,

Grafton, Va.:

If you have enough re-enforcement at the west you may order the Tenth Virginia Infantry and Battery B, First Virginia Artillery, to stop at any points on the railroad east of Grafton where you want them. We must hold all Milroy's troops ready to return if needed; but I think of sending the Ninth Virginia to Scammon, on the Kanawha, and giving Milroy something from here in exchange for it. The battery will leave Harper's Ferry between 12 and 2 to-night, and the regiment of infantry perhaps not until near noon to-morrow.

Brigadier-General KELLEY,

Grafton, Va.:

Another regiment, the Tenth Virginia Infantry, and Battery B, First Virginia Artillery, will leave Harper's Ferry for Granton to-night. I think from your reports you can harldy want more troops in that direction. What is your opinion? We may next require them east of you. It is absolutely necessary that you find out something certain of the movements, position, and number of the rebels. They may suddenly move to the valley or east of the mountains, concentrate, and come down that way.
