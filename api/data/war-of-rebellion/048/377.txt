this side of Bristoe. They belong to Anderson's division of A. P. Hill's corps. They both agree in the statement that Hill's and Ewell's corps left Warrenton yesterday morning at daylight, and marched on Bristoe Station and Catlett's, hill's corps having the left; that these two corps comprise Lee's entire army, not over 30,000 fighting men all told. These deserters are very intelligent and seem to be well posted. I belief their statements can be relied on. They report that one of their divisions was seriously repulsed yesterday. The enemy now hold the Warrenton pike at Gainesville.

Very respectfully,

J. KILPATRICK,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
