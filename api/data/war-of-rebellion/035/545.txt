(Received, in cipher, 7.40 p. m.)

His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

I advise you to relieve Major General A. E. Burnside from command of the Department of the Ohio immediately by telegraph. He has been plausibly pursuing a policy hostile and adverse to your wishes and instructions and those of the Secretary of War and General-in-Chief. Send some thoroughly brave man to take his place. I cordially recommend Hooker, who is a brave man, and will be very popular. We are on the eve of important events, which require you to pursue the course I suggest. We are threatened with mobs and riots and bloodshed throughout our entire Western country. Orders 38 has kindled the fires of hatred and contention, and Burnside is foolishly and unwisely excited, and, if continued in command, will disgrace himself, you, and the country, as he did at Fredericksburg.

Please acknowledge the receipt of this dispatch. I am absolutely right. Douglas was my preceptor.

J. M. CUTTS,

Captain Eleventh Infantry, Judge-Advocate Dept. of the Ohio.
