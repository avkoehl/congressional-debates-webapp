HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, December 28, 1862-11.45 a.m.

Major-General GRANGER,

Lexington, Ky.:

Just heard from Boyle. Fighting going on at Muldraugh's Hill. Morgan's force larger tan reported. Can't you send troops at once to Louisville? If you do not, we may lose that place. A single regiment would help. Have you sent any force to Lebanon? My last telegram, sent last night, not answered. I fear the road is seriously injured.

H. G. WRIGHT.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, December 28, 1862.

Gov. DAVID TOD,

Columbus, Ohio:

Last night I received intelligence from General Boyle, at Louisville, that Morgan had passed our larger posts on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad; had got possession of Elizabethtown, and that more troops were necessary at Louisville for its security. I at once ordered General Ammen to send Colonel Wilcox's regiment without referring to you, as it was too late to communicate. I trust this action will meet your approval. The regiment will be returned for completion of organization, if desired, after necessity for its services at Louisville is passed.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, December 28, 1862-1.25 p.m.

Gov. DAVID TOD,

Columbus, Ohio:

The raid into Kentucky may be more serious than our information has led us to believe, and we may want all the force we can raise. Will you hold any forces under your control ready for service, and notify me of what I can count upon?

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, December 28, 1862-1.30 a.m.

Major-General JACOB D. COX,

Marietta, Ohio:

It is impossible, in my judgment, to increase the force in Kentucky as soon as desirable, and you will therefore detach as much of the force in the Kanawha as you prudently can. So direct it to report to me without delay. I have heretofore spoken of Crook's division. I am not particular about this. Send such troops as you can spare, and reorganize those left in the Kanawha as you think proper, under whatever commander you may select.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
