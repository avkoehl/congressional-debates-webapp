Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report all quiet at this hour. At 11 p. m. last night a small party approached and fired upon my right rear outpost near Sturdivant's Mill. At 3 a. m. I sent a patrol to Lee's Mill and another by Sturdivant's Mill to the Norfolk road, thence to Prince George road, thence in the direction of Lee's Mill until the connection was formed with the other patrol. No enemy was to be seen. At my extreme advance near Gurley's the enemy, as usual at night-fall, advanced his lines to within seventy-five yards of my front, retiring at daylight to the edge of the woods. Nothing else of moment.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOS. C. DEVIN,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

On being refused, on of them became quite indignant, and stated that she had been passed in the day previous, and was told that she would she had been passed in the day previous, and was told that she would be allowed to go out. She further states that she has been in the habit of passing the lines whenever she wished to do so.

General GRANT:

DEAR SIR: A lady friend and myself on the 16th were ushered into your lines by your pickets in order to search for subsistence, as all we have has been destroyed by your army, and are still detained without any real cause, consequently I implore you as chief commander to release us forthwith, as each of us has little children that are suffering for our lone attention. We are at a lady's house who has no means, and we are very dissatisfied, as we are not able to compensate her for her kindness. Your immediate attention to this will be considered by us one of the kindest acts of humanity.

Very respectfully,

MRS. E. M. DANFORTH.
