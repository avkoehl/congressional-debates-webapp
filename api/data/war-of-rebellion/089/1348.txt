SIR: Information has been received that the cargo and machinery of the Agnes Fry, aground below Fort Campbell, can be saved, though the ship must probably be lost.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA,Wilmington, December 29, 1864.

Flag-Officer PINCKNEY, Wilmington:

SIR: The enemy having drawn off entirely since his discomfiture, there is no longer a necessity for the patrol on the river which you kindly established at my request. It affords me great pleasure to convey to you the assurance of my admiration for the conduct of your officers and men serving Battery Buchanan during the bombardment of the 24th and 25th instant. General Whiting speaks in the highest terms of their gallantry and efficiency. When the reports in detail are received I shall be able to lay the matter before the Government in a more formal and satisfactory dispatch.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, &amp; c.,

BRAXTON BRAGG.
