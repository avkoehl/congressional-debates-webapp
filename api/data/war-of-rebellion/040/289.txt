BALLOON IN THE AIR,

April [29], 1863.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: The enemy's line of battle is formed in the edge of the woods, at the foot of the heights, from opposite Fredericksburg to some distance to the left of our lower crossing. Their line appears quite thin, compared with our force. Their tents all remain as heretofore, as far as I can see.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

T. S. C. LOWE,

Chief of Aeronauts.

BALLOON EAGLE, OPPOSITE FREDERICKSBURG,

April 29, 1863.

Professor LOWE:

SIR: In accordance with your order, Lieutenant Libby took the balloon in tow along the river bank. When I was opposite south end of the city, I could plainly see heavy earthworks, and well supported by a large force. These earth works were nearly southwest, in thin wood. Some movements of army wagons; nothing more.

Yours, respectfully,

E. S. ALLEN.
