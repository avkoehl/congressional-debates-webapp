HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,Before Vicksburg, March 2, 1863.

Brigadier General B. M. PRENTISS,

Comdg. Dist. of Eastern Arkansas:

GENERAL: Hold Gorman's DIVISION in readiness to move, under the command of General Hovey, the moment Ross returns from his Yazoo expedition.

I want you to hold the country from the Mississippi River to Coldwater, by way of the Pass, as long as we are likely to use it. For this purpose you can use such of your troops as you may deem proper.

Transfer one of the best old regiments from Ross to Hovey, and send Colonel McGinnis back to his regiment, or the brigade in which it is.

With a few days such weather as we are now having, I hope to be ready for prompt action, and want Hovey, with his old DIVISION, with me. General Gorman will receive orders assigning him to the command of the post, and Hovey to the command of the Twelfth DIVISION (his present DIVISION), Thirteenth Army Corps.

These troops, when they move, will bring with them their camp and garrison equipage, ammunition to the amount of 200 rounds per man, and ten days' rations. Four teams and two ambulances will be all the transportation required.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. GRANT.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,Before Vicksburg, March 2, 1863.

Major General STEPHEN A. HURLBUT,

Comdg. SIXTEENTH Army Corps:

GENERAL: Break up all your garrisons north of Jackson as soon as possible, and hold all your surplus forces in the vicinity of Germantown, or nearer Memphis, if you think proper, in readiness to be ordered here, should they be required.

Do not weaken Corinth, however, and only abandon Jackson, Bolivar, and Bethel when you are satisfied that those forces will be required to hold your east and WEST lines.

The rolling stock should be got over south of the break before abandoning the northern parts, if there is any immediate prospect of getting the road completed.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. GRANT.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,Before Vicksburg, March 2, 1863.

Major General STEPHEN A. HURLBUT,

Comdg. SIXTEENTH Army Corps:

GENERAL: I am now sending transports to bring down the DIVISION of troops which you received notice some days ago to hold in readiness. I hope, general, you will push them forward with all possible dispatch. These troops should bring with them 200 rounds of ammunition, ten days' rations, all their camp and garrison equipage, and four teams and two ambulances per regiment. Any poor mules they may have might just as well be turned over to the quartermaster in Memphis, as this country abounds is such stock and of a good quality.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. GRANT.
