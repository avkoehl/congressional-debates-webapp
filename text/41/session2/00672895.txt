Mr. CARPENTER. Yon have my permis- j
sion. [Laughter.]
Mr. SUMNER. Thank you for that.
[Laughter.] Will the national courts recog-
nize the common law?
Mr. TRUMBULL. Oh, yes.
Mr. CARPENTER. They cannothelp them-
selves.
Mr. SUMNER. The Senator from Illinois
says "Oil, yes." That is a question which
has been discussed greatly from the beginning
of our Government. Now, a simple statute
conferring this power on the courts supersedes
that question.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I wish to say a word 
Mr. FERRY. It cannot do any harm. Let
lis pass it.
Mr. EDMUNDS. My friend from Massa-
chusetts is mistaken in supposing that there
has ever been any difficulty in the national
courts, as he properly characterizes them,
about the power of the conrts to enforce com-
mon-law rights, which are rights of property
everywhere. The difficulty has been in pun-
ishing misdemeanors, because there could be
no common-law misdemeanor against the Uni-
ted States, as the courts have held. There-
fore I assure my friend that there is not the
slightest difficulty in the United States courts
in enforcing all common-law rights of prop
erty.
Mr. CARPENTER. They do it every day
in repeated suits.
The bill (S. No. 205) was considered as in
Committee of the Whole, and reported to the
Senate without amendment.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Let me inquire of the
Senator from Massachusetts whether he wants
the preamble to the bill retained ?
Mr. SUMNER. No; I do uot.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I move to strike it out.
The motion was agreed to.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a
third reading, was read the third time, and
