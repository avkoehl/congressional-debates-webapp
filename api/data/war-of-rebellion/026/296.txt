Immediately on the first driven in to the Jamestown and Edenton roads. Immediately on the first alarm the long roll was beaten, and the troops deployed in line along the breastworks, running right and left from Fort Dix. Third relative conditions continued as follows until the siege was raised: The Sixty-ninth Regiment defending works in front of its camp, on the right of the line; the One hundred and sixty-fourth Regiment next in line and first on the left of the said fort; the One hundred and fifty-fifth at first marched up from their camp in reserve and formed along the works, bivouacking at night between the One hundred and sixty-fourth and One hundred and Seventieth Regiments, and on the left of the One hundred and sixty-fourth.
