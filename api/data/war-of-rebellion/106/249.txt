Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have this day acknowledged by telegraph the receipt of Major-General Halleck's dispatch of the 9th instant, in reference to the occupation of Fort Bridger and Ham's Fork by the troops of Colonel Connor. I had already ordered the reoccupation of Fort Bridger, and I have now sent instructions to Colonel Connor to occupy such other points as he may deem necessary to guard against Indian disturbances on the Overland Mail Route. I would not recommend the entire abandonment of the position now occupied by Colonel Connor, in close proximity to Salt Lake City, where he is erecting temporary shelter for his men.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

If necessary to check conduct so unworthy of those seeking the protection of the Government, you will arrest a few of the worst, holding them in close confinement, sending the leaders, if men of position, to Alcatraz Island.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
