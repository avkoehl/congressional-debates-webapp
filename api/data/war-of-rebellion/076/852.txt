NASHVILLE, TENN., September 12, 1864.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Atlanta:

The order of Major-General Thomas for Colonel Spalding to continue the pursuit of Williams was telegraphed to General Milroy, at Tullahoma. He replies that Colonel Spalding with the Tenth and Twelfth Tennessee Cavalry were left by him at Pulaski on the 7th. I presume by General Rousseau's order that only the Fifth Tennessee went back with him to Tullahoma. He at once started the Fifth Tennessee after Williams, and gave orders for the Ninth Pennsylvania Cavalry, then at Murfreesborough, to follow also and meet the Fifth at McMinnville. The latter went to that place, but returned to Tullahoma last night, not having heard of the Ninth Pennsylvania. Williams they report at Sparta. I have telegraphed to General Starkweather to know if Colonel Spalding is at Pulaski. If there, shall he still be ordered after Williams? Not a word from General Rousseau since the 8th.
