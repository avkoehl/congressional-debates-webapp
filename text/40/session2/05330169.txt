So the House resolution was concurred in.
Mr. ANTHONY. I desire to say that my
colleague, [Mr. SPRAGfE.] who did not answer
to his name, is detnined at his home by illness.
Mr. HENDRICKS. I desire to say that I
was called out of the Senate for a moment at
the time the vote was taken. If I had been
present I should have voted for the resolution.
THE CURRENCY.
On motion ef Mr. CORBETT, the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, resumed the
consideration of the bill (S. No. 148) to raise
the value of legal-tender notes to par, the
pending question being on the motion of Mr.
Morrill, of Vermont, to refer the bill to the
Committee on Finance.
Mr. CORBETT. Mr. President, much has
been said and written upon the subject of re-
suming specie payments. It is a subject of
vital importance to our people, to our financial
standing abroad, and to our permanent pros-
perity as a nation at home. I propose to
discuss the bearing that the present system
has upon our agricultural, manufacturing, and
commercial interests, and our intercourse with
other countries.
It must be obvious to every observing mind
that the large amount of irredeemable paper
currency issued during the war is the source of
all our trouble in returning to an international
gold currency. To foreign Governments and
creditors our balances must be paid in gold or
its equivalent, if the trade be against us, as it
has been for some years past. At the present
time, our vaults being very lean of gold, we
have resorted to payment in interest-bearing
six per cent, bonds, for each dollar of which
foreign capitalists are paying us say seventy-five
cents in gold. For every seventy-five dollars
in gold we are paying foreign capitalists annu-
ally six dollars in gold interest, making eight
per eent.per annum in gold. It would seem
that this is a very large interest to pay to our
foreign neighbors when they are borrowing
money in their own countries for from three to
four per cent, per annum. The question now
arises, how shall we stop this enormous drain
of gold and United States securities ? So long
as gold and these securities are a cheaper re-
mittance than other products of our labor, just
so long will our importers ship gold or United
States stocks, thereby making us a constant and
heavy contributor of the precious metal to the
gold centers of Europe. Let us now see if a
gradual resumption will not remedy this grow-
ing and alarming evil.
The first step toward resumption should be
to issue gold notes in similar denominations to
the legal-tender notes, that shall be payable on
demand. There should at the present time be
issued and put in circulation not to exceed
ninety per cent, of the amount of gold held by
the Treasury of the United States. Exclusive of
the amount held by the Treasury subject to gold
certificates issued by the Treasury our receipts
from customs are now about fifteen million
dollars in gold per month. Let the Secretary
of the Treasury be authorized to sell these gold
notes to the extent of $7,000,000 a month for
legal-tender notes; the legal tenders received
m payment therefor to be retired from the cir-
culating medium of the country, the gold notes
taking the place of the legal-tender currency.
These gold notes would be a representative of
something tangible, would be used to pay
duties on imports, used by the banks as a re-
serve to redeem their own paper, used as a cir-
culating medium on the Pacific coast, used by
people traveling to and from the Pacific, and
to foreign countries to some extent. The
Treasury not being permitted at any one time
to circulate in gold notes more than the ninety
per cent, of the specie on hand this would
make them always good for the gold.
This would practically reduce the present
currency, and increase a currency the value of
which is represented by the gold in the Treas-
ury, thereby nearly doubling the amount of
gold and its representative and decreasing legal
tenders about one third, which must necessarily
bring them nearer one price or value. It would
i cause more gold to flow into the Treasury on
the Atlantic as well as the Pacific slope.
I I estimate that the Secretary of the Treasury
i could issue $90,000,000 of these gold notes
' during the coming year, which, if sold pru-
J dently—say $7,000,000 a month—would prob-
, ably bring on an average thirty per cent,
i premium, making a profit to the Government
j of $27,000,000, which would be equivalent to
contracting the legal-tender notes $2,250,000
per month for twelve months. In other words,
it would withdraw $117,000,000 legal-tender
notes and substitute therefor $90,000,000gold
notes. This will be one step toward a gold
basis, and a very important one. It will
gradually and imperceptibly bring us nearer
the gold standard in all articles manufactured
and in all articles of produce, and enable us
more nearly to compete with our foreign
neighbors and to export our surplus products
in place of our gold and United States stocks,
thereby enabling us constantly to increase our
gold and our gold notes and decrease our legal-
tenders, until our Government circulating
paper currency shall be based upon the gold
in the United States Treasury, and that, in
my judgment, is the true basis.
The United States Treasury should always
be prepared to meet its notes, on demand, in
gold. When that is the case our Government
stocks will be worth dollar for dollar in gold.
This will actually save to the country during
the next four years, in estimated exports of our
United States stocks, by the increased value
upon them, say upon $600,000,000 of United
States bonds, the sum of $150,000,000. What
should we think of a business man who should
continue to issue his notes and never pay them,
and who should live beyond his income, or, in
other words, be constantly expending more
money than he was earning? How long would
his credit continue after it was known to his
creditors ? This is exactly the position that
we now occupy as a nation ; and what is true
of an individual is true of a nation. We must
stop giving our notes to our foreign neighbors;
we must stop sending the gold out of the
country. This we can do when a step toward
resuming specie payments is taken. It then
becomes a necessity to retain the gold in the
country and in our vaults in order to meet our
gold notes. When we take this step the banks
will be obliged to prepare to resume specie
payments, and the sooner they prepare to meet
this contingency the better for them. The
longer the Government and the banks defer
the day for resumption the more difficult it will
be, for the following reasons :
Our receipts of specie from the Pacific are
being very much reduced.

ary 1,1866, to Novomber 20,1866, was... $38,297,350
