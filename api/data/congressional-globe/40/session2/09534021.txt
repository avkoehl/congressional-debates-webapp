crease of commerce in some of the great pro-
ducing and trading nations of the world; and
I will begin with
GREAT BRITAIN.
The United Kingdom has about four thou-
sand miles of navigable waters. For a num-
ber of years prior to 1833 the exports and
imports of that country had averaged about
Four hundred million dollars; but during the
seven succeeding years lines of raitroads were
constructed, which have been added to from
year to year; and the construction of railroads
and increase of commerce is shown to be as
follows:

1865  13.2S9 2,393,000,000
1887  - 2,500,000,000
Thus it will be seen that the commerce of
Great Britain, which had increased but little
for many years, received a new impulse fiom
railroad development, and from $400,000,000
in 1833 reached the enormous sum of $2,500,-
000,000 in 1867.
FRANCE.
Let us now see what effect the construction
of railroads has had upon the commercc of
France, whose people are blessed with about
seventy-seven hundred miles of navigable
waters.
The following figures will show the progress
of commercial development in connection with
railroad construction in that country:

1865  8,130 1,432,000,000

Ilsre it will be seen that commercial pros-
perity kept pace with railroad construction ;
so that from $403,000,000 in 1840 the exports
and imports of France increased to $1,440,-
000,000 in 1867.
BELGIUM AND NETHERLANDS.
I will now bring to the attention of the House
the remarkable effect that the construction of
railroads has had upon the trade of the two
busy little States of Belgium and Netherlands.
While under the Government of the United
Netherlands their commerce reached a point
of considerable importance: but at the time
of their separation in 1830 the total exports
and imports of the Netherlands were nearly
treble those of Belgium, resulting mainly from
the fact of superior means of transportation
by canals and by sea; but in 1835 Belgium
commenced the construction of a wise system
of railroads, so as to give her an outlet into
Germany, Austria, and France.
Immediately production and trade received
a powerful impulse, and with the progress of
her railroad system the commerce of Belgium
increased in a ratio unparalleled by that of any
other nation on earth; the soil was more skill-
fully tilled; valuable mines were opened ; fur-
naces and work-shops were erected, and the
little State, insignificant in point of territorial
extent, outstripping her neighbor, the Nether-
lands, has taken a first-class position as a pro-
ducing and commercial people. The follow-
ing figures may prove interesting as showing
the progress of commerce in Belgium in rela-
tion to railroad construction and the manner
in which she outran the Netherlands in the race
of progress:

1862 1,180  380.000,000
1864 1,350  475,000,000
I now wish to compare the figures showing
the commerce of those two countries, calling
your attention to the fact, Mr. Chairman, that
the Netherlands constructed no considerable
extent of railroads until as lato as 1856. And
that she possessed vastly superior advantages
over Belgium in the way of water communica-
tion, by means of her extensive canals and by
the river Bhiue, commanding the trade of Ger-
many:

This enormous production and interchange
of wsahh is theresult of the labor of a population
of a little more than four million five hundred
thousand, on a territory of eleven thousand four
hundred and two square miles, Belgium being
in fact but little larger than the State of Mary-
laud.
INDIA.
Mr. Chairman, I now propose to detain the
House for a short time while I examiue very
briefly the progress of railroad and commercial
development in the distant and almost, unknown
British province of India. That vast, fertile, and
populous region has for more than a century
been under the domination of Great Britain,
and is now controlled by a Governor General,
who, iu the name of the Queen, under the in-
structions of a secretary of state for India,
makes and administers the laws for one hun-
dred and fifty million people.
The climate and productions of a considera-
ble portion of India are very similar to those
of our southern States, and it lms long been
the earnest wish of British statesmen to stim-
ulate the production of cotton in that distant
province so as to compete with our country in
the growth of that great staple. As long ago
as 18-19 the British Parliament incorporated
railroad companies for India. For many years,
however, very slow progress was made under
the lead of private enterprise; in 1850 about
two hundred and twenty miles of railroad had
been completed, and it is probable that under
the same management five hundred miles of
railroad would not have been completed at
this day. British statesmanship, however, con-
ceived the grand design of securing the con-
struction of live thousand miles of railroad in
that vast empire by Government aid. Eight
great companies were incorporated, and the
Government guarantied the payment of S366,-
000,000 five per cent, bonds to aid in the con-
struction of the roads. The rebellion in this
country causing a great dearth in the cotton
markets of the world greatly stimulated the con-
struction of these India railroads. Early in
1863 the India cotton regions were penetrated,
and the crop of that season was brought to the
coast by rail, and to-day a net-work of four
thousand nine hundred and forty-four miles of
railroads is about completed in that country.
Let us see what effect the construction of these
railroads has had upon the commerce of India.
The following are the figures :
Year. Imports. Exports. Total.
185 8 5151,000,000 $133,000,000 $289,000,000
185 9  172,725.000 152.660.000 335.385,000

186 5  247,570,000 347,430,000 595,000,000
The following figures show the value of the
exports of raw cotton for a series of years:
185 9  $20,000,000
186 0  27,000,000
1861   35,000,100
1862   107,000,000
1863   168,000,000
1864  183,812,000
The enormous expansion of British produc-
tion and trade at home and in India is really
one of the marvels of this great age of progress,
and is to be attributed to the wise development
of their railroad systems. Let us contemplate
for a moment these amazing commercial re-
sults. The United Kingdom has a yearly
trade of $2,500,000,000, India has a yearly
trade of $595,000,000, making a grand total
of $3,095,000,000.
UNITED STATES.
Mr. Chairman, I now come to examine this
subject with reference to our own country.
The people of the whole civilized world recog-
nize the fact that no nation in the' 'tide of time''
has ever made such grand material progress
as has the United States of America. The
people of this country know that we owe much
of our prosperity to the construction of rail-
roads, but many persons, no doubt, have not
examined the statistics of commerce and rail-
road construction, to mark how steadily the
trade of this country has kept pace with the
increasing facilities for internal communication.
Following, 1 give a table showing the progress
of railroad construction and commercial devel-
opment in the United States:
Years. Miles of railroad. Total exports
and imports.
1830  41  8160,000,000
1840  2,197  239,226,000
1815  4,522  232,000,000
1850   7,475   330.000,000
1855 17,398  536,625,000
1860   2S.771  762,300.000
1866   37,027 1,003,000,00ft
Here we see the commerce of the United
States, which in 1830amounted to $100,000,000,
reach the enormous sum of $1,003,000,000 in
1866. And while Great Britain, India, France,
Belgium, and the United States had a total
commerce in 1840 of $1,471,000,000, in 1866
their commerce reached the startling sum of
&6,003,000,000.
An examination of prior statistics, shows that
this marvelous growth of commerce is far in
excess of the increase of population in those
countries, and can only be accounted for upon
the self-evident proposition that productive
industry is developed and stimulated by an
increase of cheap and convenient means of
transporting the fruits of labor to market.
And now, Mr. Chairman, let us explore this
great maze of figures, and ascertain, if possible,
the law which has governed the growth of
enterprise, industry, and trade in the coun-
tries I have named. I affirm that production
and commerce iu Great Britain, France, India,
Belgium, and the United States—the leading
commercial nations of the world—has kept
pace with the progress of railroad construc-
tion. I give the figures of the pro rata increase
of exports and imports of those countries since
1833, for each mile of railroad constructed, as
follows:
r, t . Yearly exports and imports
Countries. ,^er Iiale 0f railroad.
Great Britain $110,000
France  69,000
India  65,000
Belgium  33,000
United States  25,000
As I have just shown, the total exports and
imports of those countries increased from 1840
to 1866, a period of twenty-six years, $4,532,-
000,000, while the increase of railroads daring
the same period was sixty-three thousand and
eighteen miles, which gives an average increase
of $71,000 of commerce for every mile of rail-
road built. And, sir, startling though these
figures appear, I challenge an investigation as
to their correctness. And I affirm that for
every mile of railroad constructed in the United
States our exports and imports are increased
to the extent of $25,000; and assuming that
§10,000 of this sum is composed of articles pay-
ing a duty of thirty per cent., we find that the
annual revenue of the Government is actually
increased to the extent of $3,000 in coin lor
ever}'mile of railroad constructed. And, sir,
the experience of the last thirty-six years
demonstrates the fact that this increase of com-
merce produced by railroad construction is not
ephemeral, but enduring, and that it enlarges
from year to year with the permanent improve-
ment of the country.
And now, sir, I come to the consideration
of House bill No. 847, entitled '• A bill to aid
in the construction of the International Pacific
railroad, from Cairo, Illinois, to the P.io Grande
