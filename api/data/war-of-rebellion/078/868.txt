PALMETTO, September 24, 1864.

Brigadier-General ADAMS,

Selma, Ala.:

I suppose General Taylor does not understand the position of this army as it now covers Opelika. Therefore you will countermand your instructions, and Armistead's brigade will move without delay to Phillips' Ferry, as previously ordered.

J. B. HOOD,

General.

Ten thousand or 15,000 bales of cotton at Griffin. Had I not better remove it before I have the track taken up? Rails are being taken up above Griffin rapidly.
