this evening a scout into Loudoun, and should have heard from him by this time in the event that he was approaching Sandy Hook or Berlin. I have no information of any other force with him.

Respectfully,

HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,December 7, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

It was Sandy Point, instead of Sandy Hook where the force of guerrillas was reported. Sandy Point is in or at the east side of Manassas Gap. There was a report also that a raid was intended on the Winchester road at Charlestown or Summit Point. These reports are given for what they are worth.

No officers have arrived from General Wright. I have sent the men of the Sixth Corps to Washington, in charge of Lieutenant-Colonel Hunter and three other officers, with suitable guards. They ought to arrive there all right. I shall send to front to-morrow morning some 400 men of the Nineteenth Corps and General Crook's command.
