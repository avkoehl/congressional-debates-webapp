G. K. WARREN,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, August 4, 1864.

General BARTLETT:

I wish you would push your picket-line to-night out just as far as possible, so as to get a view down into the ravine, and have them throw up earth to cover themselves. We must fight to do this, if necessary, as the whole line seems to be getting scared by mining rumors, and we must have a view into the ravine.

Very respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOS. J. BARTLETT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
