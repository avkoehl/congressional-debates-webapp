Second Veto Message—Mr. Pioffit.
H. oí Reps.
ihe-victor^-so hardly achieved. I consider, sir, the speech de
iiveied"tfiis<riyby the gentleman from Virginia as calculated
to do mich mischief by its* excessive violence and pergonal
allusions And even the conciliatory lancuage used by the
Executive lias been misrepresented and scoffed at; and the gen
t}eman, alluding to it, says that the President whtningly asks
oí Congress "compassion and forgiveness" Sir, there is no
SHGÍy language made tase of fa the message; the gentleman must
fenow thia There is nothing approaching it Then why aun
btíteto the President such humiliating conduct? It is, to say
ihrfjeaSt of it, «stremely reprehensible and grossly unjua, as
tending to place the executive in a false position beioie the
CO«fltry. The gentleman must know that thousands who po
rase his iamarks will imbibe from them false impressions, and
««rely he could not wish that.
K «hall now proceed, Mr Speaker, to investigate the chaiges
&f ft personal character made by the gentleman, regretting bin
cerely^the necessity I am under of engaging m such unprofitable
d&CUSfliOO.
1 "wish to call the attention of the House and of the eoun
try^to* one particular feature of the chaige uf perfidy which
the gentleman from Virginia has preferred against the Pi est
de^*& He says that this is not the first time that John Tyler
¿as been thus charged, and the charge proven lie says that
John Tyler was elected to the Senate of the United States m
1827, over John RanrOlph, by an act of peifidy I will not
stop, sir to defend the Legislature ot Virgm a from thi odioue
imputation on us honor, I leave that to its notable Repre-
sentatives of both parties The gentleman's, colleague [Mi
Oilmbr] has already expressed his indignant disbelief in the
assertion. But, sir what must we think of ihe o, en declara
tí >h made on this floor by the gentleman [Mr Botts] that he,
having been benefited politically by theneason, ought not to
complain of the traitor? Sir this is a startling an astonishing
avowal of a strange species of political morality Have tve
not tallen, on evil times, when such an admission can be openly
made in an American House of Repiesentativesi What, sir'
the beneficiary of treachery and treason announcing to the
world that treason, and openly admitting that he ought not to
complain, because the political benefits derived Pom that
treachery mured to himself and his party* Sir, however much
I must regret to hear su^h language made use of in ^is Hoese,
Still, if it is to be used, I am glad that it has been done in th s
i>pen manner It carries upon its face a refutation The avowal
of the gentleman is "per se" sufficient to put the country on
its gaard against this and similar charges Sir, the gentleman
read us an extract from a pamphlet to prove this alley at on, but
he favored us not with fhenama <>f the author It may be that
It iseneofthoseanonymous productions of paity malignity or
personal pique so o ten spit inn the political arena by dtban
pointed aspirants for place and powei A pamphlet, sir, it, the
gentleman's evidence against John Tyler, who has been in | oh
tical life for thtity yea is, and who has filled all the lushest
offices in the gifr of his native State and of the nation Why,
sir, the gentleman can find pamphlets and letters, and news
paper productions charging General Washington with tow
ardice and treachery, JefTe.son with corruption and peifidy,
and our beloved Hamsun with defalcation, and treason and
base poltrooneiy And does not every honorable man look
«pon these vile effusions with loathing and contempt unuttei a
ble? But, sir, I shall now call upon the gentleman to explain
to the country how it is that he has been the constant warm,
and ardent supporter of John Tyler ever tunee the act of
treachery which he says was perpetrated in 1827* I sav, sir,
that the gentleman, when a membei ot the Legislature of Vir
fnnia, voted for Jehn Tyler for the Senate of trie United States,
ong after this act of perfidy, as the gentleman now says, had
"been proven
[A voice here exclaimed, "Is it possible?"]
Mr Proffit continued Yes, sir, it is possible; the gentle
man did vote for John Tyler for the Senate of the United otatts
He can deny it, if I misrepresent him He used evei y ejcert.on
o secure the election of that man, who, as he now eays; was
guilty of perfidy y ears before And sir, this is nut all The
gentleman voted for John Tyler for Vice President at the late
  ection He was one of i he most active and efficient supporter?
of the man who, m 1827, as he now asserts, wasguiltv of irea
Chery Bull have not done with the gentleman He was a
prominent member of the Whig Central Committee, composed
ofrnembersof Congres, which committee upon moie than
one occasion, vouched for the purity of the character of Guie
ral Harrison and John Tyler    Sn, if he knew of John Tyler's
Serfidy, he is responsible to this nation for not avowing that
nowledee previous to ihe eUction; and, sir, he has been fauh
less to his trust m suffering John 'lyter's name to stand in
ecribed upon the Whist banner as one without spot and withou
biemieh But I have still another evidence to rebut the gentle
man's charge of perfidy, and that evidence has been furnished
by himseli to day He lead to tins House a letter addressed by
him to the President, marked 'private and confidential," in
which letter he expresses feelings of friendship and sentimen s
of regard towaidshim It was written, «n, during the time the
first Bank bill was in the possession o*" the Execume He m
formsthe Piesilent in that letter chat if hf vetoed he Bank bill
the Cabinet would immediately resign and that le(the Piesi
dent)could not form dnotherfrnm the Whig lanks If sir the
gentleman really heheved the President capable of perfidy, how
comes u that he is in piivate and confide ntial coriespondence
with him wtthm the last four weeks?   What becomes of his
Srofessionsof friendship, voluntinly made public m thi4- House/
ir, the countiy will pidge of these chai ees and of the «pint
whicn actuates him who makes them But anothei feiturein
this matter has been exposed by the genikman He tells the
President in his Jettei thus fortunately given to the public,
"that if he vetoes fhe Bank bill, his Cabinet wd] jmmediiely
resign, and that he cannot form another from the Whig party ;
ísow what becomes of the charge made in this House am! in
the otherend of the Capitol andm the public nress thaticabal
was here formed, the object of which wi^to hi^a'cup the Whig
party, dissolve the Cabinet, &c ? It appeal , sir, by the gen
t'eman'e own letter, that'he scheme of di^niv ng iba Cabinet is
one agreed upon bvhm Felf and Ilia- fuend« and not only h¿f
but that the President sha I he prevented from foimmga new
one composed of WI113* And now, sir, who con6* 1 utt the ca
bal? Who is it that charges the President with a desirp to form
a coalition with the Opposition par y, and ye openly avows that
anew Cabinet could not be formed ofgentvmen oí the Whig
partyl Camtbeprssible, Mr Speaker tint a p'an is deter
mined on to compel the President to call gentlenvn of the Oj ■* >
sitioo into his Cabinet that an opporturity may be afforded f">r
tJema>nCmghim,and thus to add to the grots injustice all eadv
done to his mouves and actions? If so, I tell gentlemen their
<■ hf mine will fail J hey cannot drive the Pteeident frt m his
de'crmination to maintain his position, and m punty and ho
nest> to adnnn'ater the Government upon the principles on
which he came into pov* ei
Having thus hastily glanced, sir, at the ielative positions of
the gentleman from Vngiria and thePiesident of the United
States, lea'! upufl the gentleman for his proofs of the charge of
paifidv Vr i f sn I demand, in die name of justice, proof I
demand in the name of the country
i Here Mr Botts said that if Mr Proffit would give him
the remaindei oí the time to which Mr P was entitled, he would
gue proof ]
Mr Pr ffit continued No, doubt, sir but the gentloman
would be glad to take the floor from me No doubt he would
lejoice th it 1 should ceaseto hold him to proof of his chaiges
He wou1 , T pieeume, lead us more extracts from newspaper",
moie qi 0 apons from pamphlets Jle, m, has had possesion
of the floor for an h>ur, and a* hough he opene I with a derla
ration that he po sussed u deriaote evidence, sti'l sir he failed
to present any thing but a pamphlet and a quotation horn the
Richmond Ei quirei concerning a dinner to Mr Giles, neither
of which approached ihe al egation of perfidy Sir, let the
gentleman hand me his prooi1- and I will read them to the
House, and here, unprepared as I am, 1 undertake 0 refute
them Si>,there is not the slightest evidence against lohn Tv-
ler He was elected to the Sena'e because the Le^Hdtuie of
Virginia, well krowing his honesty and correct principles, he
lieved that he would honor his native Mate in the hign office
to which they called him He received many vott shorn those
who differed with him politically, but that, sir, is pi oof of the
high chai acter he maintained even with his poll ical oppo-
nent You and I sir, hive received, when candidates many
Totes from those who i'iffeied from us in politics I) d we ever
dream of hemg charged on that -icoimt with perfidy?
Leaving, then, the gi inleman toreconcite his support of Mr
Tyler with his thrge of perfidy, and aiso to settle with his
own conscience fur having n ade the charge unsustamed by
proof,I proceed to notice an jther statement made.
The gentleman hassaid that an offer of support was made to
the President by the Opposition pdity through the Richmond
Enquirer, if he, the President, wnold abandon Whigpnnciplee,
and the gentleman quotes a letter from Mr Rue hie on the sub
jectofthe Bank bill He then proueds to charge the President
with having accepted the overiure«i and instances a  proof of
Mr Tyler's perfidy to his party the fact of Mi Lund Washing
ton and some dozen othet cleiks being íeinstated m the Gent
ral Land Office, aftet having uet.11 di-=mis^ed by the Secreuiy
of (he Tie miry He «<*'v=s th-vt the clerks immediattfy pit,
ben'edthem^elve^ totns President and declared that "although
they were hostile to Genera! Harrison and the principles of the
Whig paity, still they wtr< pc< d Tyler men " He tays that,
upon this statemen1 tney were forthv.it' reinstated Again,
sir, I call upon him for proof Give me the proof sir, that the
President reinstated thet-e cle-ks because they were his friends
[Here Mr Botts paid he would, and whuj *redm Mr Frof
fit's ear ]
Mi Proffit continued Sir, the gentleman whispers m my
ear He loudly piefer* charge^ and then whispers pioofo
Let the gentleman tell this House—let him'ell this countrj —
not whispei to me, sir, what the House may think an answer
to my call. !->ir, injustice 10 the Ptesideiu let him prove his
charges m the face ol day I dei y thi'  accusation against the
President He never reinstated Mr Was! irgton at all That
gentleman never was, in truth, formally di mipsed Heie
ceived notice that his services would be dispensed with, and
he a^ked the Commissioner of the Gerrral land Office for a
suspension of the arder that he might have time for interces-
sion Time was grantea him, and the Pie ¡dent requested the
Commissioner tnsL&pend action in the ca< e of the clerk?, and
the Commi sio 1er acceded to ihe President's request, but he
never inteifered with the authority of the proper officeis of the
Treasury Department, and I refer the gentleman to the Com-
missioner to sustain tbesta'ementl have made Sow, sir, what
becomes of this charge? The gentleman willrolieve me from
an unpleasant situation by te'hng the ilou^e what he whisper-
ed to me If it be a secret, he ought not to have told me If
it be not, let the world know it Open charges should not be
made on «ic'et information, and yet, sjr a giave chaige of
perfidy to thi, Whig paity is based upon SMch shallow authority
as this
I call, sir, upon the crenileman from Virginia for proof of ar>-
0  her chttree made by h m
He says that the President, "inspired by a mad ambition, and
with a view to secure his own íe.ekction, had detached him-
selt from his party and his friends, and thrown himself into the
arm« of the Opposition " £11 where are the evich rices that
the President has ever declared a wi*h foi re election? Where
has he given cauee fot the accusation that he I us thrown him-
self into the aims of the Opposition? I call upon the gentle-
man for proof He rffered none when on the iloor, he issilent
now sn     Then I call upon the gentlemen r>f'he opposition

viilually or as a paity? (Numerous voces here answered
"Nevei, lever") No, sir never has Jonn Tyler for one
moment forgo en the principles on which ne was elected, or
his duty to his cojrtry The gentleman says that he has been
vis ted by Oppo*i 1 m mem^eio Yev,su, his house has Ireen
as open c.s his eart He hat, treated all men, Whigs and Op-
position, with kindness, with couitesy %\ ith hot-pnality, and for
this he is charged With going over to the Opposition Phis is
his sole offence

for a continuation of power, no party piesses supported from
the public tieasure, no violations of law, or ittempted avoid,
anee of it; and yet, sir, he is accused of abandoning Whig
principle^, because he e-on^uentiousiy d ffers with Congress on
the chai acter of a. fiscal ¿gent of the Government yrt assuring
us oí his anxious wish to es ablish an agerit which will meet
the wants of thenatiou I say, su, that the President feeis as
deeply and sincerely on this subject as an) member on this
floor.
[Mr Madshall of Ke itucky a^ked Ml P if he would tell
the H< use what the Piesident was m favor of]
Mr Proffit sa-d I sir, am not authorized to speak for the
E\ecuuve I do not pretend to b^ an exponent of his parti
cular view , but, sir,if Iundeistand'hem, he is m favoi of a
fiscal institution hfvirg for its ob,ect t^e collection safekeep
ing, and disb rsementofthe public money, ¿nd which shall
be free from all constitutional ubjection J hope sir that this
explanation is sau^actoiy to my friend horn Kentucky
[Great laughter 1
[Mr Botts asked Mr P for the proof!
Mr Proffit I, sir, am better prepared than the gentle-
man from Vnginia Irefei hnn to the message of the Presi-
dent, theie he will find his opinions openly avowed. And,
sir, it is identically the language nml by Gen Harrison on
more than one occasion, and to whicr I leferrtd some days
Bince, and should I have time, \Mil again refresh the memory
of the Hou^e by quoting
If the gentlen an fiom Vngima is at a loss fer proof of this
charge, I will proceed to ant ther, and it may be that he will
be better fortified on his ntxt point
He say-a that a similar chaige of tieachery was preferred
against $sr lylei some thieeyeais since and &o unpopular did
it render him that he could not have obtaireda nomination for
the mo t inferior office m the State, and in confirmation of this
he states that the Vngima delegation at the Harnsburg Conven
tion did not vote for Mr Tyler Now, sir, every person on
this flooi knows that he was nominated by the unanimous
vote of that body, not oi ly without any wish on his par* but
in direct opposition to his expressed wishes and remons^rpnees,
the Virginia delegation, our of mo'ives of delicacy, remaining
silent on the subject The gentleman says that "the Virginia
delegation could not go back and tell the people they \oted foi
such a man" And yet, su, Vnginia íesponded to it nobly,
enthusiastically John Tyler's name was echoed m praise by
evei y Whig, and even his political ad verbal íes spoke of him with
respect And, sir, 'such a man" was supported warm iy by this
very gentleman, who has now b0 many thaiges of peifidy to
prefer, and that people, who would rot vote lor him for the
most insignificant office as he asserts voted for him for Vice
Presdentofthe United States Wai, sir, until the gendeman's
speech reaches Virginia, and you will leceive an indignant de-
nial of this charge from the Harbours, the Leigh\ and other
noble sons of Virginia who represet ted that patriotic State fn
the Convention at Harn-burg Vou will see, sir, whether the
thousands who voted for John Tylei for Vice President consi-
dered him the perfidious traitor the gentleman seems to mti
mate But, =11, I am unwilling to do the gentleman injustice
If he has any semblance of proof to su&tain this chaise, I will
pause to receive it If there be none, I pass on to eximme
some o'her of his statements
The next is rather an insignificant one, but it will serve to
open the eyes of the people t  the system of warfare urged
upon ihe Piesident The gentleman says that the President,
daring the canvass, avowed sentiments totally different from
those now enteitained by him, and that a letter proving the
fact is how in the possession of a member of this House,and
ready 0 be produced. Sn, I wis happy to hedr this It
looked hke faun ess, I watted anxiously to see that let'er, art!
was cei tain that it would be forthcoming, parti* ularly as 11 was
m the House when the genileman was speaking Bet, iir, it
was not produced Now, sir, 1 demand that thi letter be lead.
Io it in the possession of the gent'emarfi Who has ni Wha',
aHmute'J The letter on this floor, sir, and yet, when chai*
Jenged to produce it, a guarded sil nee leigns among those so
clamorous m charge*' Well sir, the honest people of this
country mu^t judge of ihese things
The President is chaiged, sir, with a desne tor oesees not
only the sword of this nation, but also the purse That is to
say, he wishes to combine in himself powers inimical to the
free institutions of the Republic This charge ip based upon
the faUthat, by tne repeal of the Sub Treasury bit!, the cus-
tody of the public moneys is placed in the Treasurer of the
United States, no Bank bill having beccrre a Jaw The Presi-
dent is accused of having signed the bih ret eal ng the Inde
pendent Treasury law, and of having vetoed the Bank bill with
a view of obtaining the ru^ody of the public mot ey bir, what
an absurd iccusation is this? Pnsr, \our public puree is
empry, the Givtinmerthas ^carcelv money enough to pay the
calls daily made upon it, at das for theswoid, we all km w that
the President cannot call a single r an into ervice without
authuity 'rom Congre & But, emce this muter has been
bioaehed, I, sir, will give the causes which led to this state
of things
Immediately on arriving at Washington a dettrin nation was
evinced o rer eal thetíuh Treasury hi 11 at the earliest day The
distinguished Senator fiom Kentucky [Mr Clay] introduced a
bill for that purpose Itwashumed through the Senate with
an avowal that it muti go to thePiesdent and íeccve his
sanct'on on the fourth day of July —the very day on wtichtr-e
bi'l to be repealed receded the signatuie of the late Exec '1 e.
It came to this Hou«e, and was re c red to the Committee of
Ways and Me^ns, but on tbenestday was perceived that a
blunder had been committt-d, and the b* 1 was sent to the Fi
nance Committee There, sir, it lemamed ior Wf?ks, the
fourth oí July passed,but nota woid wis said about the bill
As Tden changf jdd taken place n opinions Tne*e was a
