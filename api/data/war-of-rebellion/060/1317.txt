Respectfully returned to Adjutant-General.

On General Beauregard's arrival at Weldon he was met by one of my staff officers, who carried a written memorandum for his guidance in a conference with the general. This conference covered all points of interest and importance in the department, and was intended to put the general more fully in possession of the views of the Government and of the state of affairs in his department than could any written communication.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.

ORANGE COURT-HOUSE, April 27, 1864.

General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE:

General Imboden reports General Averell in command of troops in vicinity of New Creek. He cannot, therefore, as reported, have gone to Kanawha. General Imboden will keep you advised.

R. E. LEE.
