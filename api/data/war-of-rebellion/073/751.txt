My Second Brigade was repulsed by one brigade of cavalry and two of infantry near Poplar Springs. They attacked the fortifications. I have lost severely both in officers and men; among the rest Colonel La Grange.

NEAR SMITH'S HOUSE, May 10, 1864.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that my command skirmished heavily with the enemy all this morning, driving them back to the fortifications on Potato Hill. When we reached the base they opened two pieces of artillery. I think their force was cavalry and mounted infantry. My loss yesterday was 136 enlisted men and 11 officers killed, wounded, and missing; Colonel La Grange wounded and a prisoner. Twenty-five of our wounded were brought off the field. The enemy's loss was more severe than ours. The force attacking consisted of three brigades, and our men were simply overpowered. Most of the loss is in killed and wounded, many of the wounded having fallen into the hands of the enemy. I will send you a report as soon as received from brigade commanders. I am now on the left and front of Cox's division, Twenty-third Army Corps.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. M. McCOOK,

Colonel, Commanding.

GENERAL: I received your dispatch directing me to move with my column to support a brigade and battery at 10.30 p. m. It was dated 4.30. No brigade or battery has passed on the road indicated as yet. I have sent a note to General Stanley about it. My command was engaged several times to-day and lost about 40 killed and wounded. I drove the enemy to the ridge on General Stanley's left, but could not dislodge them. I am doing all I can to cover the left and have every road regularly patrolled. I have a courier between here and Stanley's headquarters, over which you can send dispatches.
