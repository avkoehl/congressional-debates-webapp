Making public officers depositaries—Mr. Wall.
Senate.
oí New Jersey, both houses concurring, by a very
large majority, passed the ioifowmg resolutions -
' w Ueieas the present crisis m our public affairs calls for a
decided express) n of the voice of the people of this State,
ami whereas we consider it the undoubted right of the Legts
latuiea oí the scveial Slates to instruct those who represent
then interests 1i the councils of the nation in all matters which
intimately coi tun ihe public weal, and may aftect the happi
ness or well being of the peop'e    Therefore,
' I Be it revolted by the Council mid General Assembly
otilas S/We, That, while we acknowledge, with feelings ol
dev mt ¿latitude, out oblieauons to the Great Ruler 01 nam ns
foi his mercies to us as a people, that we have been preserved
like fr im foieign war, from the evils of m ernal commotions,
uid the machinations of designing and ambitious men, who
would prostrate the fan fabric of our Union , that we ought,
nevutheless, to humble ourselves m his presence, and implore
his aid lot the perpetuation of our Republican institutions, and
for a continuance of that unexampled prosperity which om
i oj niv h is enjoyed hitherto
' ¿ Resolved, That we have undiminished confidence m
the nte=rtiv and fiimneos of the venerable patriot who now
holds the distinguished post of chief magistrate of this nation
an 1 whose purity of purpose and elevated motives have so
oiten received the unqualified approbation of a latge majority
ol his fe'low citizens
' i Re all d That we view with agitation and ahum the
existence and eig-mtic power of a great moneyelmc rpjia
tío i which threatens to embairass the operatuns o! the Go
voinment, and, by means ol its unbounded influence ujK>n
the omreic/ of the country, ti scat er distress and m n
thr ugh mt the community and that we, theieforp, solemnly
oelieve the pi&ent Bank of the United States ought not to be
lechartered
4 liesohed That our Senators in Congress be mstiucted,
and our members of the House of Representatives be requested,
to sustain, by their votes and influence, the course adopted by
tl e->ecietary of the Treasury, Mi Taney, in relation to the
Ba lk of the Ijnitetl States and the deposites of the Government
moneys, believing, as we do, the course of the fcecietary to
have been constitutional, and that the public good required its
adoption
'"i Resohtd That the Governoi he requested to forward a
eopvofthe above resolutions to each of our Senatoisand Re

Those reso'utions were presented to trie Senate
on the tit entieth of January by my respected pre-
decesor [Mr Frelinghiysen ] On the twentv-
sev jith oí January, that gen leman addiessed the
Senate, and among other things, said.
I know that I shall have the sympathies of the Senate, when
1 tecali to them the instiuctions lately transmitted by the Le
gislature of the State which I, m part, have the honor to repre
sent This is a gieat national question, of common concern to
us all, for these instructions are multiplying, and call certainly
lioinme sir for distinct and respectful notice The lmpoit of
these instructions, I admit, sir, cannot be mistaken The terms
ais unequivoeal and plain to any apprehension They instruct
us to sustain, bv our votes and influence, the course of the Se
cretary of the Ticasury m the removal of the deposites

puiposes, and cast himself, with all his fame, and all the confi
dence of his countiy, into the crisis, and sink or rise, assuecess
1 ah crown his intrepid conduct "
On the fourteenth of February, 1834, my col-
league, in presenting a memorial to the Senate,
sill1
He hadbcl eved and he was of the same opinion ^till that
th- I e-íislamie, m adopting the resolutions which had been for
wai led o him had giossly erred in their representation of the
p bin voice and he had now m ins hand two of the evidences
( i vheir eiror instiucted, then, as he had been, fey the Legis
la mt of the State lor what he conceived to be Executive
usurpation, and chaiged by those who elected that I egisiature
io appose such isurpatioil, he had a consolatory reflection, in
tí e conviction tlm the course he had pursued would be sus
ta ned by a majontv of the people "
0>i the twenty-first of March, 1834, my colleague,
in a speech delivered in the Senate, said:
Theie is another tribunal before which we [himself and his
re ¡league, Mr Frelinghuy&en 3 shall meet most cheerlully
one aceuseis, and as cheerfully abide the veidict and judgment
which shall be lendered after the healing, so far as they shall
a ect us personally, however we may feel forthe laweand n^ti
tutiois of our country That tribunal is the people of New
.Teiae), whom we most solemnly believe and think we hav¿
ab mdant evidente foi oui belief, were uotcorrectly represented
.n hose instructions Asjam is it truethatthe Legislature has
a right, in disiegard ol popular opinion, and against the wishe*
of then own constituents, to control the other agents of those
constituents^ Is the power vetted in toe Legislature on tl is
point independent of the people of the Sta^l Are they m that
themasters of the people! I had supposed that the people wre
the source of power, and that their will was as controlling m its
action on the m' mbers of the Legislature en this subject as on
any other, and that their commands were only to be regarded as
valid, when they conformed io 'he lnslinctions and commands
of tiler coneiituen s This may be skepticism, but I beg to
=ay that it is oí J Republican'sin and Democracy not that of
m idem day which seems to require that the will of a few who
hantsii to be in a Lcislature or are leaders ofa party, should
boob^nd, iHdispite of ihe opinions and wishes of the people
Mi, be'ieving as I do, that my corsuiums disapprove the act
of the Executive,f should be ntuiliy of treason towards them, if
I obey ed the orders of o.hers in approving that act against my
own judgment '
Mr President, an issue was thus fairly formed
between the Legislature of New Jersey and my
honorable predecessor and colleague It was tried
before that great tribunal which they selected in
October, 1834 They had a fair hearing, for they
both addressed public meetings of the people in
different parts of the State, and no one appeared
against them The people rendered a verdict and
judgment against them. 1 hey e'ected an increased
majority, if I lecollect ngnt, of the friends of the
Administration a-dthe principles involved m the
instructions—at all events, a large majority. The
wheel did not come to a whirl that year.
How did my colleague and my predecessor fulfil
their pledge to the public? Did they obey, or re-
sign?   Let the records of this Senate speak.
But the Legislature of that j ear gave them leave
to imparl for one year.   They did not mstiuet.
In October, 1835, a new election for members oí
the Legislature took place, whose duty .t was to
appoint a Senator in the place ot my predecessor,
whose time expired on the 3d of March following.
It is well tnown to the peop e of New Jersey
that the name of my predecessor and my osvn were
pet oefore the people ot New Je^'ey as opposing
candidates for that office, ana both v. ere put in no-
mination by the Whig part} I, sir, was not se-
lected for any particular affection w hich they en-
tertained for mc, but to gratify other feelirgs. I
was held tip before the public in such otlious co-
lors that I had not the option of declining the high
honor, had I been disposed to do so, without com-
promittmg my own honor and character, and that
of my party Sir, I should not have been a can-
didate at that time had I been left to my own voli-
tion, although it was the only office I desired my
own affairs required my attention I became thus
the repiesentative of the principles of the instruc-
tions oi 1834, and the friends of those principles
triumphed b> a large majority The question was
submitted directlv to the people, and they gave
ju igment.   I am here to cairy it into effect.
The Legislatuie of 1835, the same which elected
me as Senator on the 7ih of November, 1S35,
passed the following resolutions

I came here, Mr President, with these instruc-
tions in my hand, coming ttesh from the people,
and iterated and reiterated both by tne people and the
Legislriture. What were the}, sir? That the peo-
ple and Legislatuie ot New Jer>ej had unqualified
confidence in ihe mtegnty and firmness of General
Jackson, and in his purity of purpose, and elevated
motives.   That the Bank ol the United States had
disturbed the currency of the country, and scattered
distress and rum throughout the community, and
ought not to be rechartered. That the removal of
the deposites wai constitutional, and required by the
public good, and that the Senators of New Jersey
weie required to sustain, by their votes, the course
adopted by the Secretary of the Treasury in relation
to the Bank of the United States, and the deposites
cf the Government money.
After these first instructions were leceived, on
the twenty-eighth of March, 1834, my honorable
predecessor and my colleague voted directly in the
face of them "that the President, in the late Execu-
tive proceedings in relation to the public revenue,
had assumed upon himself authority and power
not conferred by the Constitution and laws, but in
derogation of both."
The resolutions of 1835 instructed the Senators
to vote for expunging that resolution, as not war-
ranted by law It had been passed by those Sena-
tors in defiat.ee of the clear and decided expression
of the people and Legislature of New Jersey, under
the assumption, bj the Senators, that it was not in
conformity to the will of the people The people
and the Legislature desired them, if they could not
obey, to resign. Altnough pledged to resign in
such an event, they would neither obey nor resign.
New Jersey then had no \ oice on this floor, though
she spoke in instructions. Where was then the
solicitude of the honorable Senators from Ken-
tucky, and the other Senators on thii floor, who
now manifest such sympathy for the voice of the
people of New Jersey? Their eloquent tongues
were mute, if not engaged in furnishing arguments
to coloi disobedience and contumacy
Sir, w e have seen that the recusant Senators took
issue before the people of New Jersey upon these
great questions, that they pledged themselves to
ab de t le \ erdict ana judgment of th<it tribunal,
ar d surrender their offices if it passed against them.
Did they do so^ No, sir, and what was the ground
assumed by my co'league to lustily his non-fulfil-
ment of his pledge1 It was, that instructions were
not binding, and that the instruction it expunge
was unconsututtonal. But h<" had estopped him-
self from making any such defence. In his inau-
gural address as Go vemor of New Jersev made on
the 29th of October, 1834, a part of nmch I have
read to you, as it ¡3 provide fir the very case, he
declares, m speaking ol constitt. ttonal obligations
' But my ownjudgment is not to be deemed miallible, Ihe
will of the ofñ^ei is not the Consumum Ihe people ofiSew
Jetsey made the Constitution They havea right to say what
was their meaning and when they havc ''aid it either b> them
se ve^ or their constitutioi al arenis, meir decision is binding
even upon he conscience* of those who have to act for them

This, Mr President, is the h.story of the doc-
trine of instruction in New Jersev, as believed m,
and practiced bj both paites My honorable col-
league was supposed to be the iottnder of that
school, but he treats his scholars very much as
the Pitnce of Denmark treated the courtier Po-
lomus Insirucuons are like a cloud, which first
assumes tne shape of a camel, then a weasel, and
finallv, "is veiy much like a whale "
Eut, sir. his school is not original, he has
undoubtedly bonovved from the horn book of the
honotable Senator from Iltnmcky, [Mr. Clay,]
who sajs that he believes m instructions under
certain qnal ficatious. What those qualifications
were he has not told us, but it is tan to infer, from
his practice, that the qualification is, vv hen he likes
them, or when they please him.
Mr President, upon the subject of instructions,
I acknowledge that m\ colleague has the advan-
tage of me. He is the best mstraued Senator m
this body, and if he obev s reso ntions, it is claimed
as a merit, ai 1 ii he disobe s plain, positive in-
struction*-, stands recusant lor three j ears, promises
obedience, and then again disibeys, it u, such high
merit as to entitle htm to the thanks of the Le-
gislature," for Ins untiring and able defence of the
nghis oí the Sute and the people " Sir, upon the
subject of ins i uctions, he is clotaed with popish
infallibility, while I  lot obeying am to  be doomed
