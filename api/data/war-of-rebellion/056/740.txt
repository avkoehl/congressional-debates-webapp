HEADQUARTERS, November 23, 1863.

General B. BRAGG:

The enemy has heard that you were re-enforcing here, and is making a diversion to prevent it. Let the troops come on and let us finish this work.

J. LONGSTREET,Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS, November 23, 1863.

Maj. Gen. J. WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: I send your orders received from General Bragg. You will have to turn over the command to General Martin and repair to General Bragg's headquarters. I think it doubtful whether you will have much to do below, and suggest that you telegraph to General Bragg for authority to return to us as soon as the cavalry can return; direct General Martin to bring it back, leaving the usual picket at Kingston.

I have just heard of a large number of hogs that we might pick up if we had our cavalry back. General Bragg now telegraphs that the re-enforcement for the enemy is doubtful and at all events is but small.

Let the cavalry make the diversion down the river-that is, a brigade-after capturing or dispersing the enemy's force at Kingston, and let the rest return to me as soon as possible.

Very respectfully,

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

The last ten wagons captured by you are not yet received here.

BRAGG'S HEADQUARTERS, [November 22, 1863.]

General LONGSTREET:

The general commanding directs that General Wheeler will turn over the cavalry with you to General Martin and return here. He will bring with him any regiments belonging to the brigades, as well as the artillery, over and above the two batteries allowed the two divisions with you. General Wheeler is to assume command of the cavalry here.

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Maj. Gen. JOSEPH WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: Permit me, general, to hope that the intercourse which has for more than a week existed between us may be soon renewed
