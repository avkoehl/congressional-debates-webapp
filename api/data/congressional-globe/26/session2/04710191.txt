may be applied. It propones to mete out lo ihem
the same remedy which it applies to other traders
If they become insolvent, and are unable to pay
their debts, or if they become dishonest, and refuse
to pay them, the bankrupt law takes hold upon the
property of the corporation, winds up its affairs,
and distributes the effects amongst its. creditors. It
does the same things with brokers, merchants, and
other traders. The bicker, or merchant, or private
banker, can as well argue that the law destroys their
trades, as can the corporation. It leaves them all
with their franchises and privileges unimpaired.
The broker has the same right, under his licence,
to resume his trade afier hr. effects have been given
up, as he had before. So also the merchant and
private banker, and so also the incorporated bank-
ers, have all their franchises left unimpaired
Their common name—their common seal—their
right of succession—the exemption of tluir indivi-
dual property—all these, which constitute their cor-
porate being, remain in full force and existence—
none of them are impaired, much less destroyed If
their effects are gone, they have still the right to
proceed upon iheir charter, procure other capital,
and again commence operations under the same
corporate existence. The body corporate still ex-
ists, with all Us immunities, faculties, and func-
tions as well after the bankrupt law has spent its
force as before.
My conclusion is, that the argument of the Sena-
tor from Sou'h Carolina is unsound, in the first
place, in denying to a bankrupt law that suprema-
cy to which it is entitled, and, in the next place, in
regarding the bankrupt law as the exercise of a
right destructive of the right of the States to create
corporations.
But there is still anothei argument somewhat re-
lied on to show that we have no power to apply a
bankrupt law to corporations It is said thit, up
to the time our Constitution was formed, no in-
stance is to be found, either in England or Ameri-
ca, iu which a bankrupt law hid been applied to
corporations. Hence it is inferred that the fra-
mera of the Constitution did not design to include
corporations. The fact may be, and I believe is,
true, that no such instance can be found, but it
by no msans follows, that an exemption oí trading
corporations is the nece sary consequence It
could hardly have been anticipated by the framers
of our Confutation, that, in little more than half a
century, nearly a thousand banking corporations,
and tens of thousands of other trading corporations,
would spring up under the patronage of State au-
thority. The true question is, whether, if they had
foreseen the evils that were to arise by tin  abuse
of corporations, they would have grante i 10 them
a special exemption from the operation of the
bankrupt power. It is indisputable, that trading
corporations come within the scope and purview of
the bankrupt policy, and it is altogether probable
that, if the present state of things could have been
foreseen, instead of exempting, they would, with
even more clearness, have granted the power.
The result of my reflections on this subject is,
that the power to include banking and other trading
corporations in a bankrupt law is clearly delegated.
I regard it as a power ot great value, and the only
one in the Constitution which enables this Govern-
ment to furnish a corrective to the abuses of State
banking. I regara it as unfortunate for the coun-
try, that it has been suffered to he dormant so long
in the Constitution. Much of the distress which
the country has suffered from time to time frem the
excesses of paper currency, might have been
averted by the application of this remedy, and, I
trust, the time is not very remote, when it will be
called into exercise, to operate as a permanent
check upon the acknowledged evils of our banking
system.
But, as well satisfied as I am of the existence of
this power in the Constitution, and of i s great
value, I would be far from making an appli-
cation of it at the present moment Whatever
excesses the banks may have been guilty of in
times past, and however much we miy be dis
posed to censure their misconduct, we cannot shut
our eyes to the fact, that, in their excesses, they
but went along with the spirit of the times.
That they stimulated the public mmd, and fur-
nished the means lor speculation, cannot be denied,
but, at the same time, it must be admitted, that
the state of the public mind seemed not only at
the time to justify, buv even to demand a liberal
policy of discounting by them. In iheir present
crippled condition, and in the present embarrassed
condition of the country, it is a serious question,
whether any measure should be taken to coerce
the banks to a speedy and rigid collection of
their debts They are suspended, and unable to
resume, because their debtors are suspended,
and unable to pay to lliem their debts A bank-
rupt law, either to lake immediate effect, or to
commence at a future day not remote, would in-
evitably operate to increase very largely the exist-
ing embarrassmen's of the people. A system of
prompt and rigid collections would necessarily
comrrence wuh he banks against their debtors,
and, from them, ex end throughout the whole com-
munity It i« estimated that the debts now due to
the bank* in the United States amount to about five
hundred millions of dollars It is impossible to
calculate the íramenae distress which the sudden
enforcement of the collection of this vast amount
of debt would produce There is no remedy for
the dlstresse^ ot the country which can be furm>h-
el by legislation. Any attempt at it must aggra-
vate the hardness of the times The establishment
of a National Bank would but mciease the present
embarrassments. The pissage of a bankrupt law
applicable to batik.  would have the same effect.
Mutual forbearance, renewe 1 industry, and rigid
economy, are the only certain remedies for the re-
covery of the country from us present distressed
condition. When these mfa hble remedies shall
have effected a restoration of the times, and ena-
bled the tolvent binks to resume in good faith,
then, in my judgment, would oe th? proper time to
subject them to the operation of a bankmpt law.
It would then operan, not to the destruction of the
State banus, or to the aggiavauoa of exis mg em-
barrassments, but as a check on future banking
excesses, and a preventive ot future suspensions.
If I should be ca'led on, under such circumstances,
to decide upon a bankrupt bill, I «hall most cheerfully
give it my support. But, at present, I cannot con-
sent to exercise even that valuable power, when
the consequence^ would be so fatal.
APPENDIX.
Since the foregoing «peech was delivered, my
attention has been drawn to a repoit, submitted to
the Senate b, the Secretary of the Treasury on the
12th of February, 1841, showing the losses of the
General Government and of the people of the
United Stales, from the use of banks and bank pa-
per. The facts contained in thisdocument present
the evil* of our banking sys'em ia so strong a
view, and prove so conclufively the necessity of
some measure that will regulate or check the abuses
of that sy-tem, that I feel myself justified in ap-
dendms the following statements, called and con-
densed from that document-

The income or gross profits of banks are de-
rived not only from loans of the capital, deposites*
and circulation ovtr and above the specie on hand,
but from, exchanges, and a larger interest than 6
per cent, m all cases, and hence, it is estimated,
that the annual gross profits must average 12 per
cent, on the capital For the last ten years, the
estimated average bank capital, yearly, has been
$235 000,000, on this amount, a profit of 12 per
cent per annum gives $28,200,000 each year, and
|2s2 000,000 for the ten years.

REMARKS OF MR.  PIERCE,
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE                        f
In Senate, January 28, 18J1—On the following/e-
soluftpn-                          /
Resolved, Thafthe Committee on the Post Office
and Post Roads be instructed to inquire in(o expe-
diency of changing the rates of postage on4ewspa-
pers which are sent less than thirty miiei from the
place ot their publication
Mr. PIERCE said he deitred to (say a single
word upon the resolution wiuph harj, been submit-
ted, not upon the suggestion office proprietors of
newspapers alone, but in consequence of lexers re-
<eivid irom othtr persons equally, perhaps more
d eply, interested, although in a different way. He
regarded the subject as important, and desited to
draw to it the at'ention of the chairman, and a¿k as
ear y consideration on the part of the Committee
on the Poat Office aad Po«t Roads as they could
with convenience bes'o.v Alterations in the exist-
ing law  were doubtles, required far beyond that
contemplated in the resolution Changes in the
rates of letter postage, so far at least as to strike
off ths i)u/grar/rctc¿tons, the quarters, halves,   and
