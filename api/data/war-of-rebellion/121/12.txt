ADJUTANT AND INSPECTOR-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

January 5, 1865.

Respectfully referred to Brigadier-General Winder.

Please see indorsement from the Secretary of War.

By command of Secretary of War:

H. L. CLAY.

[Third indorsement.]

Respectfully returned to the Adjutant-General.

This subject has already been a source of great concern (see my letter of December 21, 1864, from Columbia*). In that letter it was suggested to remove the prisoners either to Alabama or Southwestern Georgia. Since then, however, events have transpired to render both those places unsafe, in my opinion, and I know of no place south and west of the Savannah River that could be considered safe. (See my letter of January 24, 1865). Every effort will be made to remove prisoners from Salisbury for the within and other reasons. There are, however, only about 8,000 prisoners at Salisbury.

Respectfully,

JNO H. WINDER,

Brigadier-General.
