that is all, then force them; they will clear out. Communicate across at Quarles' Ford with General Burnside. Major Roebling will go with you.

Respectfully, yours,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

I will send other troops to take your line while you are gone.

G. K. WARREN.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS, May 24, 1864-1 p.m.

[General G. K. WARREN:]

GENERAL: I have arrived at Quarles' Mills and Ford. It is a sort of falls, but infantry can easily cross. I communicated with General Burnside, and he has sent Crittenden's division, which is now crossing. The enemy's skirmishers have been in my front, as I advanced. Major Van Buren, of General Burnside's staff, reports the enemy strongly entrenched. The enemy does not yet know of our movement.

Very respectfully,S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, May 24, 1864-2.15 p.m.

General CRAWFORD:

You need not advance farther; extend your skirmishers out toward the railroad and see if you can connect with our cavalry. I sent a regiment down the railroad just after you left here. Try and develop in this way as much of the enemy's front as you can, perpendicular to the river. If you hear firing on your right it will be caused by our cavalry.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS, May 24, 1864-2.30 p.m.

General WARREN:

GENERAL: I find from the residents that we are at Waltham's Mill [now destroyed], and that Quarles' Ford is about 1 mile above us. The enemy advanced his skirmishers on my right, but they were driven in. He is evidently making new dispositions. Burnside has just ordered Crittenden to face the force opposite Willcox, who is at Ox Ford. A large proportion of Crittenden's force is dismounted riflemen. I fear lest communication with you on this side the river be cut off.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

There is yet one brigade of this division to cross.

S. W. CRAWFORD.
