a new ^ATIO^ a cxcHCQur i
Mr EVAN^ said that ^evri-al days a>o a i cmonal, niopos-
mgaplaifora National Exchequer of the Urn 1 states had
been referred to the Committee on TWnce This memorial
■was presented by the Senator from Omu, [Mr Allcm, j and was
VberesaltofthG deliberations of Jacob Benner  but ltapp^arcd
fiom thejournal that it emanated from a woman This was a
mistake, the name of the place where Mr Benner resided hav-
ing been taken lor the name of the memorialist Therpfme
there was, as a consequence, some doubt about the petition
being genuine The committee, however, had looked into the
subject, an! had msttucted hirrf to move that they be die
charged from it  further consideration Whatever might be
its merits, it was certainly a novel plan, and proposed to e3ta
bltsh a National Exchequer, the capital to be $200 000 000, and
under an apprehension that there was not asufficiency of gold
and silver in the country for this purpose, the memorialist de
signed to dispense with these metals and substitute a coinage oí
copper asa legal tender in payment of debts, and it was sug
gebted to purchase twenty milhonsof pounds of copper out of
which to manufacture the two hundied millions worth of cur
rency, thus making one pound Sf copper, after being coined,
equal in val ue to ten dollars The* e were many reasons urged
in favor of thi3scheme, one of which was that ¡be currency that
would be afforded would not be drained off by foreign nations,
as was now the case with gold and"ilver He moved that the
commiftpebe discharged ftom the furthel consideration of the
roemonsl
Mr ALLEN «laid that it was doe to himself to say that if he
had not be ícved that the memorialist was serious as to the e^ s
tern whirh had been suggested, he would not have presented it
to the Senate 1 he scheme was certainly an extravagant one,
but fi jwever pecuhn were the views of the memotiahst, they
wptp not more se than those of gentlemen moie conspicuous
th in h n'self The memon?listand all of hi^ family were re
pnectable persons, and it was no' hisde&ign t> impose upon the
Pénate onv'nvial matter, bfsides be was a worthy man and
from all h° fMi Allen] knew, a sensible one, bjt on tie fi an
cial and Exchequer projects oí the day, he had taken thehbeity,
common to the understanding of statesmen, to mJu'ge in hs
¡nngiration
Theromm ttee was discharged fiom the further consideiation
of the memorial
Several adveise reports of commtttee1! were taken from the
table and concurred nbv the Senate
On motion of Mr KING, it waa
Tie-solved, Tha'the Committee on the Public Lands be in
s'ruct^d to inquire into the expedienc> of authorizing William
Waller to purchase at the minimum price fractional section

PARAGE Ol THE DISTRICT BANK BILL
Mr CLAY moved that the isena'e now take up the bill from
the House, which, as amended yesteidiy and ordered to be en
fios-td, aiuhoii7es the banks in the District of Columbia to re
ceive ami piy out depreciated bank paner for one year, or
until tre banks in Baltimore or Richmond lesume specie pay

"VI  KING objected he desired to go on with the oi den of the
da3 duiui2 the nwmnst hour If the t*ank bill «should be 'iken
up at thiis tin e, a discussion might arise which wojld continue
througnniit the day
Mr CLA.Y said that at one oVlock be wanted to take up the
lesoiutmns m relation to the tariff, and he again moved that
they pr ceeú to dispose of the bank bill, as th* Senate
was piobably asfull now as it would be at any time during the

Mr Mí-PORFRTS observed that be had offered li=">merd
•n'nlwi'i h view of pffecnng a chansre m the piovi-, ons of
thpactot -septpmber last, by removing th* re rut ions which
opciated S3 unjustly and mimiously against sellers on the
pdbhc Sands He did this under toe hope thattht chmgp pio
pose it"  be eff fed would remain asa permanent provision of
law on the statute book, governing the subiort of pre eruption
Thi19 nevpr could be the case with resar 1 'o the prnvt^ons of
the act of last session It never could become the settled policy
oí the Govern ment It waa an act which had already met the
condemr-ation of the people, and if it was not changed now,
the question would be agitated from time to time mi it was re-
pealed. He pointed out how im unously it affected the dozens
of nine States, and those, too, who were least able to bear it—
poor men who had immigiated from the old SUt.es with their
families anu settled on small tracts of land, and expended all
their means in buildings and other improvements to provide a
permanent home He denounced the infraction of their pos«
sessions a*  unjust and odious m the extreme, and contended
that no Government could have a moral right to tieat such
citizens in the manner they weie tieated under the provisions
of the pet He maintained that it was the duty of the Govern-
ment, when it foundits legisla ion operating unjustly, to retrace
its steps Such was the operation of this law, and it had now
become the patuouc duty of Senators who had voted for its
enactment, to yield their prejudices, and make atonerrent by
repealing- the odiou° restrictions of the law There was not
oneof those restrictions that had not met the unqualified con-
demnation of the people He contiasted the policy of this act
with the established policy of tins Givernment heretofoie, and
showed that more iniquitous and injurious restrictions coulcí
not be devised—restrictions more at war with sound principles-
of political economv ihan tho^e complained of
Avance, in its wildest fea s, never conceived the policy of
selling from these settlers then improved lands to fill the cof-
fets of the public Tieasuiy, till the act of the last session,
which owes its origin to distribution and the dominant party.
Let it be remembered who it wa^ passed that act The story
his been told in thousands of ¡og cabins, the mmatesof which,
will long remember it Within the la<*t sixmomhs, the effects
of its impression on their hearts had been told intones ofthun
der He uiged that this was not a trivial question, nor one af-
fecting a small and obscure po tion of the citizens of this Union;
it affecte 1 immpduteiyor remotely five millions of people,
com prisma no ordmaiy sha^e of the bone, smew, and muscle,
which made up the strength, the energy, and the power of th* 
countiy The settltrs on thp public lands foimedaclass if
citizens who had pecu lar ciaima on the G ivernment foe en-
couragemen Yettheactof distnbution, in fourteen or fifteen
of its provision", was an act oí legislation agam t them—an act
of the most uni,ust and fiagitiout. eharactei Many of thes 
provisions weie at war with the spirit and genius of this Go-
vernment, and openly unconstitutional—particularly that
which coerced a citizen on accountof rights secured to lum by
the Con-tuution—rights of locomotion and perfect free-
dom as to the po^ssion of, and liberty to do what he please 
with, his pioperty, for it denied a man owning
land by inheritance, donation, purchase, or marriage—land
that might be useless or unsaleable, from settling on the public
domain upon the same terms as oth°r citizens, or, if such a.
man had been a settler, and spent his money and labor on im-
provements to make a home tor himself and family, in perfect
ignorance of this law, or at so remo'e a point irom any land
office as not to be able to learn its i evictions, he might be dis-
possessed by a new comei, who should erect a «hanty on his
farm, and occupy itbut three 'ays He 'urther remarked, that
the class of citizens who ompo3td the settlers on the public
lands, m advance of theo being offered foi sole, was a class ac-
tive, enterpiisin"", industrious, honest, and independent, who 
would as peaceably, yet determinedly, assert their rights and
maintain them, as any member of the Senate itself, should his
rights be invaded by an iniquitous and detestable enactment.
Already had large meetings of most respectable citizens, who
had settled on the public lands, taken place m Illinois, at which
resolutions vvue [ assed ¡-howj ig the utter impossibility of car-
rvmg the provisions of this la / oomplained of, into operation.
He read several of these iee< ¡ulions, and called upon the Se-
nate, before it was tro late so lo modity the act as to remove
fiom ltthe fi-atuirsof mju^ti e which necessarily I d to such a

Mr CLAY agamc^piesoed his des. re to take up the special

Mr KING leminded him that the bus'ness jiei ding mist

The question being taken, theie appeared—ayes 12, noes 10;
but no quoi urn havAi g voted, 
Mi CLaY e^ p eased a hope that gentlemen would vote one
way ortheotbei If it was the disposition of the Senate not to
act upon his resolutions, he would abide by it
The question was again taken—ayes lb, noes l1—and the bill
was laid upon the ta tie, and
The Senate accoi dmglj proceeded to the cons'deration of the
resolutionsoí Mr Ci_a"í, to mciea&e the tanff above the maxi-

of i rartical economy by ab dishing useless offices, by lopping
oft ali unrece&-aiy expenses ¡n Congress and all the Depart-
ments of the Government and by repealing the distnbmioiiact,
so as to tender any increase ot the ttnff above the compromise
art or any new burdens on the pe tple, unnecessary
The first tesoi ition w-isread, as follows
Hesoherf, That it s the duty of the General Government,
m ( ond-ictina its administration, to piovide an adequate reve-
nue within the yeai to meet the cu.rent expenses of the yeai,
and that any expedient either by loan or by Treasury notes, to
supply, m time ol peace a deficiency of revenue, especially
dur ngsuccesHiveyeais, is unwise, and must lead to } eimcious
consequfnces
The CHAIRassked if the Senate were ready for the question

Mi KING lemarked th it various amendments had been pro-
posed to the íesoiu ions by tbt. Senator ¡rwii J>ew \uik, [Mr.
Wright ]
Mr (. L^Y said Oat the amendmen's did not apply to the first
ie:>olution, and as no objection had been nadetu it, he hoped
that the question would be uken upon Hat this time
Mr CALHOUN observed that as some gentleman might de-
sire to address the Senate upon the subject, he would move to
postpone the further cor sideiation of the resolutions until te
morrow.
