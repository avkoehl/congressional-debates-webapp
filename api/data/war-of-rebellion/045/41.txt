[General BUTTERFIELD?]

The following dispatch has just been received from headquarters Second Division. It will be forwarded to General Barnes, with instructions to send a copy to General Pleasonton.

Captain GEORGE RYAN,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Division:

The enemy have relieved their pickets from the mouth of the Rapidan up to our extreme right. An hour And a half ago the captain in charge of our pickets at United States Ford reported to me that half the Rappahannock, on the south side, is very muddy. This was first observed about 4 o'clock. I sent an officer to examine the river as far as the mouth of the Rapidan. As I Expected, this muddy water comes from that river. The inference in my mind is that a column of rebel troops (probably cavalry) have been crossing the Rapidan at no great distance above its mouth since 3. 30 or 4 o'clock. Respectfully, your obedient servant, P. H. O'RORKE, Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
