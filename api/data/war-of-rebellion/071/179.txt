BALTIMORE, MD., July 10, 1864-11 p. m.

Brigadier-General RICKETTS,

Ellicott's Mills:

GENERAL: I have been trying to raise the telegraph operator at Ellicott's Mills for two hours past, but without success. Everything depends upon my being able to keep open instant communication with you. Please send an armed guard to look him up. Take him to his office. Keep him there constantly with a guard over him. If he becomes refractory put him in irons until he is ready to go to work. If you have no information of the approach of any enemy toward Baltimore on your roads, use Captain Leib's company of mounted infantry for vedette and scouting duty, and order Colonel Clendenin to report to me with his command to-day. I will send him back to you in a couple of days.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General, Commanding.

BALTIMORE, MD., July 10, 1864.

Brigadier-General LOCKWOOD:

GENERAL: General Morris directs me to inform you that Governor Bradford suggests stationing of vedetts and lookout on prominent points in the vicinity of Baltimore, and to recommend this suggestion respectfully to your consideration. Governor Bradford states that there is such a point at his country residence, commanding a wide view of the country and approaches, which might be beneficially used.

By order of General Morris:
