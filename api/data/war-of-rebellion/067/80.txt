MANGOHICK CHURCH,

Ten miles from Hanovertown, May 27, 1864-5 p.m. (Received 7.30 p.m., 28th.)

Everything going well. Whole army was withdrawn north of the North Anna during the night without loss or disturbance. All the corps are now far on their way to crossing of the Pamunkey. The Second, Third, and Fourth Division of the Sixth Corps are already near this place, followed by Hancock's corps. The Fifth Corps, followed by the Ninth, has also made a long march, taking the road by Moncure's plantation, and has not yet halted. At 9 a.m. Sheridan, with the First and Second Divisions of cavalry, took possession of Hanover Ferry and Hanovertown, finding there only rebel vedettes. The First Division of the Sixth Corps, under General Russell, arrived at 10 a.m., and now holds the place. By this time, no doubt, Russell has so far fortified himself as to be able, with his 6,000 men, 10,000 cavalry, and thirty cannon, to resist any attack that is likely to be made upon him. Remainder of Sixth Corps will be pressed forward to place with all possible rapidity. The men are much jaded with hard work and night marching. By to-morrow night the whole army will be south of the Pamunkey, and either the White House or New Castle will be our base of supplies. General Ingalls thinks the latter. We have no news of enemy. Weather fine, and roads perfect.

P. S.-General Lockwood, with six regiments, 1,900 men in all, reported yesterday. His troops were assigned to the Fifth Corps, except the One hundred and eighty-fourth Pennsylvania, assigned to Second Corps. Ninth New York Heavy Artillery, 1,750 strong, reported on the 24th, and were assigned to Sixth Corps.

HEADQUARTERS,Mangohick Church, May 28, 1864-7 a.m. (Received 6.30 p.m.)

Everthing goes finely. Weather splendid, clear, and cool. Troops coming up very rapidly, and in great numbers. The whole army will be beyond the Pamunkey by noon. No news of Lee's movements. Breckinridge is at Hanover Court-House with a force variously reported from 3,000 to 10,000 men. Wickham's and Lomax's brigades of cavalry are also there. After seizing Hanover Ferry yesterday, Torbert captured 75 cavalrymen, including 6 officers, and might have captured more could he have caught them. Rebel cavalry is exceedingly demoralized, and flees before ours on every occasion. Total number of new troops added to this army since re-enforcements began to arrive is not quite 20,000.

Secretary of War.
