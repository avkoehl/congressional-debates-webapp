I think it due to General Barton that a court of inquiry be granted him.

ADDENDA.

CAMP NEAR RICHMOND, February 29, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

GENERAL: The report of Major-General Pickett of the recent operations against New Berne contains the most injurious allegations against my course in conducting a part of the movement. Grave charges have also been made in the press and on the street. I have the honor to apply for a court of inquiry to investigate the matter, and that it be called speedily. I desire but few witness; they are convenient, not engaged, I believe, in any way to prevent their attendance. The events are recent. It is of incalculable importance to me that the imputations under which I am oppressed should be removed.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. M. BARTON,

Brigadier-General.
