Revision of the Schedules of February and March last.

Since the adoption of our last schedules for the months of February and March the financial bills passed by Congress taxing the currency have seriously impaired the value of the old issues of Confederate Treasury notes. At this juncture large numbers of horses and mules were impressed and paid for in a currency which was in a few days thereafter to be taxed 33 1/8 per cent.

The Board of State Commissioners having adjourned, and one of its members behing out of the State, it could not be convened in time to review our schedules of prices. Under this state of facts we have re-examined and rearranged our tariffs of prices, so far as we have been advised of recent impressments, proposing in this mode to remedy any diminution of valuation which may have resulted from the action of Congress upon the currency. Therefore we assess the average value of artillery or wagon horses or mules impressed since the passage of the currency bill of they 17th February last at $600. This award will entire each person to receive higher compensation, accordingly as each horse or mule recently impressed may be considered
