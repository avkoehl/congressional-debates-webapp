The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair under-
stands the Committee on Commerce desire it
to be passed.
Mr. CORBETT. Yes, sir; we desire it. We
wish it to be passed.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair under-
stands that the Senator from Minnesota asks
the bill to be withdrawn. It will be with-
drawn.
Subsequently, at Mr. Ramsey's request, the
bill was considered as in Committee of the
Whole, reported to the Senate, ordered to a
third reading, read the third time, and passed.
REMOVAL OF DISABILITIES.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The naval appro-
priation bill is before the Senate, the pending
question being upon concurring in the amend-
ments made in Committee of the Whole.
Mr.ROBERTSON. TheSenatorfromMaine
has kindly consented to yield a moment to allow
rne to give notice to the Senate that to-night,
after the_ Army bill is passed, I shall call up
Senate bill No. 969, for the removal of political
disabilities.
This "bill" contains the names of some four
thousand penitent men asking the forgiveness
of their political sins. Christ, in his Sermon on
the Mount, says:
"Ask, and it shall bo given you; seek, and ye shall
find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you."
Now, sir, these political sinners have asked,
sought, and knocked through the mediation
of the committee of which I have the honor of
being the chairman, and in the name of that
committee I ask that the door be opened unto
them, and they be restored to all the rights
and privileges of citizenship.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will
state that these notices do not bind the Senate.
The Senator from California [Mr. Cole] has
given a, notice, and so has the Senator from
Nevada, [Mr. Stewart,] but in the pressure
of business Senators must rely upon a vote of
the Senate.
PERSONAL EXPLANATION.
Mr. ANTHONY. With the assent of the
Senator from Maine I wish to make a state-
ment to the Senate.
On looking at the Globe this morning I find,
correctly reported I have no doubt, as the
Globe reports are always correct, someremarks
I made yesterday morning on the bill to incor-
porate a land company in Colorado, in the
course of which I compared the difficulty which
bills of that kind, unobjectionable, as it seemed
to me, encountered, while bills that contained
large privileges and grants went through with
facility.
It has been suggested to me that those re-
marks imply some reflection upon the Senators
who spoke against that bill ; and although I
do not see how it is possible that they are capa-
ble of such construction, yet, not on account
of those Senators, for they do not need it, but
on my own account, to protect myself from
such imputation, I desire to remove any such
possible inference. Nothing could have been
further from my intention, as nothing could be
further from the truth. I have no doubt that
those Senators who spoke against the bill acted
upon the same motives as those who spoke for
it, that is, a desire to promote the public ser-
vice; and to one of those Senators the friends
of this bill are under obligations for suggesting
amendments which, without at all impairing
its value and efficiency, removed the objection-
able features so far as to bring it within the
limits which made it acceptable to the Senate.
â€¢ liquidation of national banks.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I ask the
Senator from Maine to yield to me a moment,
to pass a bill which was reported yesterday
morning. I am willing to insert the amend-
ment suggested by the Senator from New York
[Mr. Conkling] to House bill No. 2062.
There being no objeclion, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, resumed the consid-
eration of the bill (H. R. No. 2062) to require
national banks going into liquidation to retire
their circulating notes. It requires every bank
that has heretofore gone into liquidation under
the provisions of section forty-two of the na-
tional currency act, to deposit lawful money of
the United States for its outstanding circulation
within sixty days from the date of the passage
of the act; and every bank that may hereafter
go into liquidation is to deposit lawful money
of the United States for its outstanding circu-
lation within sixty days from the date of the
vote to go into liquidation; whereupon the
bonds pledged as security for its circulation
shall bo surrendered to the association making
such deposit. If any bank shall fail to make
the deposit and take up its bonds for thirty
days after the expiration of the time specified,
the Comptroller of the Currency is to have
power to sell the bonds pledged for the circu-
lation of the bank at public auction in New
York city, and after providing for the redemp-
tion and cancellation of the circulation, and
the necessary expenses of the sale, to pay over
any balance remaining from the proceeds to
the bank or its legal representative. But
banks which are winding up in good faith, for
the purpose of consolidating with other banks,
are to be exempt from the provisions of this
act; and the assets and liabilities of banks so
in liquidation are to be reported by the banks
with which they are in process of consolidation.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I move to
insert " six months" in lieu of " sixty days."
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate as amend-
ed, and the amendment was concurred in. The
amendment was ordered to be engrossed, and
the bill to be read a third time. The bill was
read the third time, and passed.

SCHOONER L. S. DAVIS.
Mr. DAVIS. The Committee on Claims, to
whom was referred the bill (S. No. 971) to
carry into effect the decree of the'circuit court
of the United States for the southern district
of New York in the case of the schooner L. S.
Davis and her cargo, have instructed me to
report it back with an amendment changing
the amount appropriated, with a recommend-
ation that it pass with the amendment.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will
state that a bill has come from the House of
Representatives covering the same case. The
Senator from Kentucky desires to propose
from the Committee on Claims an amendment
to the House bill.
Mr. DAVIS. Yes, sir.
There being no objection, the bill (H. R.
No. 2209) to carry into effect the decree of the
circuitcourt of the United States for the south-
ern district of New Y'ork in the case of the
schooner L. S. Davis and her cargo, was read
twice, and considered as in Committee of the
Whole. It proposes to direct the Secretary of
the Treasury to pay into the circuitcourt of the
United States for the southern district of New
Y'ork in the suittherein ofAlexander if. Doug-
lass, libelant, against the schooner L. S. Davis,
her tackle and cargo, the United States claim-
ants, the sum of $21,371 20, being the amount
of the decree to the libelant in the cause against
the claimants; to be disposed of by the court
according to the decree therein.
Mr. DAVIS. If the House bill is before
the Senate, as 1 desire that it may be, I move
to strike out the amount named in it, and in-
sert the amount in the amendment to the bill
I have reported. My motion is to strike out
Â§21,371 20 and to insert $18,780.
I will state the reason for the amendment.
There was a ship lost at sea loaded with cotton.
This schooner came to her assistance and res-
cued the ship and the cargo, and the parties
tiled their libel in the district court for the
southern districtof New York forealvage. The
district court decreed that they were entitled
to salvage both upon the vessel and upon the
cargo, but declined to give a specific lien on the
cargo for the satisfaction of the s.tlvage. The
cause was taken to the circuit court for the
southern district of New York, and the circuit
court affirmed the judgment of the district court
below, giving the lien for salvage. The case
was then taken to the Supreme Court of the
United States, and the Supreme Court affirmed
the judgment of the circuit court. Now, the
salvage given to the libelants by the decree of
