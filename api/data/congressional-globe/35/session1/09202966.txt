THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 11,
of Collins & Co., to builtl others, in case of accident to
these. They did not agree to insure them against the peri)
of the seas."
Another plea is that the Ericsson did not com-
plete her trips within the time stipulated by the
contract. Says the Attorney General upon this
point:
" II. But the Ericsson did not make her trips in as short a
time, by several days, as the vessel for which she was sub-
stituted. i submit that this is not the point. The question
is, did she make them as speedily as the contract required ?
No time is stipulated for. Fourteen days is as clearly within
the agreement as twelve. Apply the legal criterion here
again. The United States could not sue the company for
canying the mails in the Ericsson, instead of the Pacific;
because the Government assented to a substitution, and the
-Eiicshon was probably the best substitute that could have
been got. As the original vessel might lawfully have taken
tburteen or even twenty days to each voyage, the substitute
can do likewise, with equal impunity to the owners."
The Attorney General concludes his clear and
convincing opinion with these words:
" Hut, inasmuch as they have kept their covenants literal-
ly, and as there is no evidence that can justify a suspicion
of bad faith, I see nothing in the case on which I can rest
my conscience in advising you to withhold from them the
money which the Government has promised to pay them."
Such are the facts of the case, and I put it to
any gentleman upon this floor, to say if it is not
clearly just that we should give Collins and his
associates what ia justly their due ?
Mr. SMITH, of Virginia. I move to strike
out the appropriation, and insert in lieu thereof
" one cent." I reduce the amount as low as I
can get it, as an evidence of ray opinion of this
case.
When Collins & Co. undertook this contract,
it was well known that it was to maintain Amer-
ican reputation and characterby successfully com-
peting with the great rival which was before him
—the Cunarders. The first compensation allowed
was $19,250 for a round trip between New York
and Liverpool. After having been in operation
some two years, they brought the Baltic up the
Potomac river, gave rich entertainments, and
begged Congress to increase that allowance to
$33,000, because, as they alleged, they could not
attain the object originally intended, without a
larger bounty. Under the influence of various
considerationsthe additional allowance was made.
They undertook to have a certain number of
steamers, and they never did have that number.
They were always short, one at least.
Mr. JOHN COCHRANE. 1 wish to correct
the gentleman in that respect.
Mr. SMITH, of Virginia. I cannot yield. I
have but five minutes. Let rne say that this con-
tract, thus solemnly incurred under a pride of
country, never was carried out. I have in my
hand a statement showing the average time made
by the Collins line and its rival for the year 1856,
and it shows that the average time is against the
Collins line. I-Ierc is the statement:

Finally, sir, however, they lost, first one, and
then another, of their steamers. They came here
and asked of the Postmaster General to substitute
an inferior service—acknowledged to be inferior
—abandoning the project on which our bounty
was accorded to them by the generosity of Con-
gress, and introducing an inferior service. Why,
what would you think of the man who had con-
tracted to supply a post-coach service, and who
afterwards asked you to pay the same price when
he got down to abuggy,and ultimately to a mule ?
That is the illustration. They come here and
demand of us to reimburse them for this inferior
service—inferior to that which they contracted to
supply. Last year they filed a memorial before
Congress, declaring that, unless they could have
certain indulgences, they would abandon the con-
tract they had made. They have abandoned that
contract. For a long time before they abandoned
that contract, they did, in the manner I stated,
perform an inferior service; and let me say to the
committee here, that the Postmaster General, un-
der the ad vice of Attorney General Cushing,made
this reduction. And, sir, after the adjudication
of the question at the time it had to be acted upon,
they come here now, and under the opinion of the
present Attorney General, who cannot find it in
his conscience to insist on the deduction which
has been made, they ask us to reimburse them.
For what? For services rendered ? For contract
complied with ? For running off the Cunarders ?
No; but for surrendering the ocean to them. For
abandoning the service. For not, in fact, fulfill-
ing the considerations of the advance made. And
we are asked now to give $147,000 to this com-
pany thus derelict to the obligations of that pride,
patriotism, and duty which they owed to their
country and to themselves. I trust, Mr. Chair-
man, it will not be the pleasure of this committee
to do any such thing.
Mr. ENGLISH. I propose, Mr. Chairman .
to make a remark or two in reply to the gentle-
man from Virginia; and I must say that 1 think
the gentleman from Virginia has, without intend-
ing it, done these contractors injustice. I do not
understand, in reference to this claim, that there
has been any violation of contract on the part of
Mr. Collins and his associates. Now, the facts,
as I understand them, are about as follows: in
1856 the Pacific, one of the vessels of this line,
was lost. Mr. Collins wrote on to the Navy De-
partment for information as to what he was to do,
in consequence of the loss of this vessel. 1 have
before me now a copy of his letter. It is dated
New York, February 11, 1S5G. He says:
" Should we not hear from the Pacific to-morrow, we
shall have to a-sk jour consent to make the beit possible
finangcment we can for the steamer to take the place of
the Pacific ; and trust, by return mail, we shai! receive your
sanction t > dr> so,'1
