27th Dong......1st Sess.
Revenue Bill—Mr. Aledill.
H. of Reps
he wants money for such purposes, and yet the
honorable chairman and otheis refer to a period
embracing such objects a  the measure of their fi-
nancial calculations
Bat, Mr Chairman, if the democratic scale
of expenditures must be taken as a standard by
those who clamored so much against it, let us see
at least that it be justly estimated What, then,
were really the disbursement!, of the administra
tions ot Jackson and Van Buren, which were so
vehemently denounced to the country i Does
their annual average amount to any thing like the
sum estimated by the chairman of the Committee
of Ways and Means, the financial organ of the
present administration m this House, as the pro
per scale of federal economy i The following
tab e will answer, as given by Mr Ewmg himsell,
m the document already cited

Thus it will be seen that the whole expenditure^
of the Government, during theadmmistrationsof
General Jackson and Mr Van Buren, including
those for the extiaordmary purposes which nave
been mentioned, averaged a little over twenty one
millions of dollars N w, although he estimates
the innual receipls of the Tietsun at only
$10,209,000, as the "lav 3i p escnt stand ," al-
though many of tne old pensioners have desc nded
to the tomb, although the public buildings are
almost completed , although trie Indians have been
removed, and the titles to their lands have been
extinguished, and although the Florida war is
approaching to a close, and is, at any rate, carried
on upon a much smaller scale, while, too, w ages
are comparatively low, and prices have fallen,—
still the honorable chairman of the Committee of
Ways and Means is not content to take the average
expenditure of the two preceding admin is1 rations
as the basis of his estimates,, but selects the last
four years for his standard, durmgwhich the largest
portion of these expenditures for prominent and
extraordinary objects were incurred Notsansfied
with $21,000,000, he proposes to expend some
$28,000,000 annually during this model-admims
tration of economy and reform' He resorts for
his example o the administration which was so
loudly condemned, and selects a period of the most
extraordinary disburse nents as tne basis oí his es-
timates i Sir, is there no room for improvement,
for retrenchment, for reform 1 Really this is treat
mg the people who had been taught to expect so
much from electioneering promises with a degree
of levity, it not contempt, which is hardly credible '
But why not at least take the last year of Mi Van
Buren's administration as the basis of his estimates^
The whe^e expenditures m 1840 were a little over
$22,000,000, which -Has a reduction of «3,000,000
upon the expendituies of 1839, and of more than
$9,000,000 upon those of 1838 The extent of ex
penditures proposed bv the late Executive for the
present j ear was only $20,000,000 , while an opm
ion was entertained that still further reductions
could be made, as the effects of those years of ex-
pansion already adverted to continued to pass away
In his annual report to Congress of December, 1840,
the Secretary of the Tieasury (Mr. Woodbuiy)
savs
"The arguments in favor of somefioitho diminu-
tion m our expenditures, and the general items m
which the reduction is considered most compatible
with the public interests, were so Ail v exhibited in
the last two annual reports as to render a lepen
tion of them unnecessary It was then believed
that the laws could be altered j>o as to admit of
safely curtailing the appropriations at once, to such
an extent that the expenditures need not exceed, in
the aggregate, seventeen oi eighteen millions
v early    After more of the pensions terminate, and
the removal of the Indians is eompWed, they could
be beneficially contracled to even, less 1han lliat amount
Such a reduction as is first <ulverted to seems there-
fore proper to be adopted now, sine e it could be ef-
fected without the probibiluy of injury to any use-
ful national establish men t, would promote public
frugality, and supersede the necessity either of
higher tariffs, di'ect taxes, or permanent debts "
We aie told Mr  Chairman, that this extraoi-
dinary session of Congress was called for by the
necessity of replenishing an exhausted' treasury,
without which the wheels of government must have
been brought to a stand    That is tne pretext, but
not the motive    A necessity which did not exist is
created by this very session    The admimsttation
was provided wilh ample means to meet the ex-
pend rtuie cal'ed foi by the appropriations of the
last session     In order to sustain this assertion, I
have b it to lesort to the report of (he Secretary of
the Treasury himself    That report states—

We shall have       -          -          -       1,936,891 77
which is the sum that will be left in his hands at
the end of the Year, after meetm  all the legitimate
and known charges upon the Treasury toi 1841
It appears, then that with the economy which
chai actenzed the last administration, and which,
from its high pietensions, was peculiarly incum
bent upon the present one, there were ample funds
in the Treasury to meet all the demands upon it,
and that there was really no necessity foi the call
of this extra session which, of itself independently
of its icts, is to add a serious item in the expendí
tures ot the y ear, and is, therefore, any thing but
sn economical measure I will not now insist upon
that magnificent disregard of minuti  which per
mits a Secietiry of the Tieasury to overlook a
sum of more than half a million of dolíais, in his
anxiety to present the most disagreeable picture of
the public finances, with the effect—1 will no* say
intention—of throwing odium on the past adminis-
tration, and justifying the ex'i avagance of the pres-
ent , but I think that it warrants us m looking en
this lepoit m the least favorable light
Having;, then, disoosed of the plea of necessity
for i sorting to the expensive and inconvenient ex
pedient of an extia session, we are thrown upon
the other motive or pretext—that of relieving the
" suffering people,' which it now seems is to be
effected by taxing the necessary comiorts and con-
veniences of life, as the bill "before us proposes,
some eight or ten millions of dollars Strange íe
lief this, indeed' The treasu y is first to be ex
haustedby distributing among the States, thrpro
ceedo of the public lands, and the deficiency thus
created is to be supplied by onerous taxes upon the
people at large'    One hand is thrust into their
pockets to give, while the other is inserted to take—
but, alas ' a larger portion. If the amount were
the same, the operation would be only silly; but
rest assured that this economical administration
does not take all this trouble for its meie amuse-
ment The juggler does not toss his balls from
hand to hand without thmkingof the shillings which
are paid bv the spectators at the door What is
meant by rebel, is, under scarcely plausible pretexts,
to give away four or five millions of dollars nom-
inally to the States, but really to corporations at
home and bankers abroad, while the deficiency
is to be made up by taxing the whole people to
nearly doub'e the amount upon their tea, coffee,
suBar, salt, molasses, and other articles of common
use But let us examine a little more particularly
this " relief" that is offered to an expectant people,
at this (more than in one sense) extraordinary ses 
sion of Congress, which is foievei to dissipate their
sufWmg, to change then tears into smi es, and
con\ ert their lamentations into accents of joy. The
long-sighed lor " change" has come, and let us see
what it nas broughtwith i' The political millenium
has arrived, and we have betore us its first fruits.
The bill before us, Mr Chairman, is drawn up
in accordance with the views of the Secretary of
the Treasury, as will be pert eived by the following
passage Irom his report to the present session of
Congress
' But as it may not comport with the views of
Congress to go into a revision and adjustment of
the customs so long before the act of March 2d,
1833, comes to have its final and permanent opera-
tion, the undersigned would respectfully recom-
mend, as a emporary measure, the levy of a duty
ot '20 pel cent advaloiem on all articles which
are now f lee of duty, or w Inch pay a less duty than
70 per cent, except gold and siher, and the articles
specifically enumerated in the 5th section of the act
of March'2d, 1833"
By the recommendation of the Secretary as well
as by the piovisions of the bill before u>, tea and
coffee which are now fiee, are hereafter to pay a
day of twenty per cent ad valorem, or one-fifth of
their actual v alue Thus, then, to supply money
for the exoibitant and unca.led for demands of this
most economical administration, as well as for the
e--pecial benefit and behoof of scheming corpora-
tions at home and clamoio is loan mongers abioad,
the nene ' hard-workmp- people ol this country,
whose unmtemí! t ng toil uea es a'l that we enjoy
oi squander, must pay a tax ol twenty per cent.
upon their tea and coffee,—their " luxuries," for-
sooth as if it were all but sinful for the poor man
to enjoy such a treat What gentlemen understand
by the teim >uxw>y, I am at a loss to imagine Re-
strict us to absolute necessines, and the list of our
wants is but small maeed Luxury is a comparative
term The savage, the slave, the serf, would un-
derstand it very differently from the fiee born
American Tea and coffee are articles ot univer-
sal consump ion m this happy country,—yes, happy,
if the schemes of the monopolist and the stock-job-
ber do not soon reduce it to the condition of less
fortunate lands —Ireland, for example, where it is
a " luxury' to eat salt with potatoes Tea and
coffee may be luxuries to the rich and the idle,
who have so many means of s ímulating the jaded
appetite, but to tile childien ol labor, infield and
forest, the renovating bowl and frtgrant cup, which
" cheer but not intoxicate," furnish a comfort and
solace not easily dispensed with Go into the hum-
blest hovel in the suburbs of your towns—enter the
simple cabin which dots the almost verge of settle-
ment , and you will find the luxuries whichthisbill
propos s to tax for the ' ehef of the people," re-
garded as among the necessaries ol life
In the selection oí alucies lor taxation, care
should evei be had to choose such as will bear with
least 1 aidship upon the laborious and less fortunate
members of society Even in monarchical Er-
gland, the and of privileged classes, policy as well
as humam'v has to a certain pxtent sanctioned <h s
benevolent pimeipie, ird I believe that the exist-
ing aw scan be greatly improvedin this paiticular.
But i is utterly outraged by the bill before u%
which is not only marked by great inequality, but
'i e grossest injustice to the mdusin   is poor    The
rt cíes seiec ed for ircieased taxn ion  are those
illumed by the laboring mar aid his family,
«!>ile tnose vvlich are left fre= or at a rate ot less
than twenty per cent, are man/ of them, such as
administer chiefly to th  vmty or pleasures of the
rich
This bul levies a tax of twen'y per cent upon
