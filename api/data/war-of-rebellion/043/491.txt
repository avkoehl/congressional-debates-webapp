chief ambulance officer-I was indebted for the energy which was displayed in their respective departments. Acting Medical Director [James T. Calhoun established his hospital and removed the wounded under the most difficult circumstances, but with great professional ability and success. To Lieutenant-Colonel {Julius Hayden, chief of staff, who was untiring in his duties, assisted by Major {Samuel B. Hayman, commissary of musters, my especial thanks are due.

Grenough, acting aide-de-camp, who conveyed my orders with precision and exhibited great coolness under fire. List of casualties at Wapping Heights is herewith inclosed. The loss of the enemy on that occasion was estimated at 250 killed and wounded, and the same number of prisoners.
