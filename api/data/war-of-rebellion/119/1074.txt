FORT MONROE, March 18, 1864.

SECRETARY OF WAR:

Unless there are specific charges against Morgan's officers, confined in the Columbus penitentiary, I think it would advance the public service to have them released and sent to me at Point Lookout. Will you please order it?

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, March 18, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER, Fortress Monroe:

There is reason to believe that Morgan is organizing another raid and it is inexpedient to release his officers before their regular turn. I had ordered them to Fort Delaware some days ago.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

FORTRESS MONROE, March 18, 1864.

SECRETARY OF WAR:

I had not intended releasing Morgan's officers at all, only to get them out of a penitentiary, as reprisals were informally notified to me and I did not wish to yield after formal action of the rebels.
