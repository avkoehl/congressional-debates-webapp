for action, something may be done, which shall produce um
formity of legal regulations at leas), at the same port
Important questions giow out of this subject    Does Con
gress constitutionally possess this power to regulate the p¡iot
age of the ports ol the countryi   If so, haa the resumption of
the power, by the pa&sage of the law of 1837, suspended the
Íiowerof the Stateb to legislate m this matter? I© the exutmg
egislation of the states ye<, m force, or has the law of 1837 sus
pended it, where that I v. applies'' These are question  of an
imponant character, and it is the sirr plestju<-t ce nut to the
pilots of the port of New York alone, b it to the city of i\ew
York, and to the State of New York, that the*? questions should
be settled—that Congiess ahoukUct fully or not ac at all m this
matter
When this bill should come up while he dd not delire that

Btitution, that the Exect uve shall cause the laws to be executed
he would have considered it a great abuse to issue a commission
and appoiotpffieeis under that clause, wi bout the authority of
Congi ess But the practice of invebtigatmg abuses, or supposed
mai pi actives, in this way, had grown into use long since in the
Executive Department, and no doubt in this instance mere pre
cedent had been followed He, howefer, consideied the clause
in the Constitution restricted the Executive to the charge of Sf-e
ing that the laws are faithfully executed by the officers of the
Government constitutionally appointed, and did not reach to the
issuing ofcommisa ons, appointment of ofiiceis, and fixing their
salaries,by the Executive, wtthoutthe authority of Congiess If
this piactice shouid be persisted in, hosts of officers migKbe
appo nted f r any other purpose, and the powers of Congiess
thereby be in a great degree superseded by the act of the Exe

WW bad been the condition of the VVhigsf They had a Chief
Magibine m po^ei who retained m omcp almost all of
the friends ol the foenatoi, and the public transactions were
oveied vn h a veil which, to the Wh g% was impenetrable
The Seratoi knowing ttieir condition, had asked them to point
to the abu«e¡> which they had promised to expose, but he would
say to the gentleman, that, in due time, and soon, he would
see some of th se abuses which for the last twelve years, had
been gradually gt owing up, m the New York custom hou e
ebf-eciafly lie had seen one of the (ommi«sioners, and had
bepn U 1 by him that although two hundred and fifty pages
had been written, theirieport was not yet completed, butthat
it would he, in the course of a few days and then sent to Con
grcss But why this impatience to call foi the report at this
rime? Had gentleman lost all confidence m ihe President and
his two vctoc*? If they had, he hoped that they would here

adoiation to the Fvecntive for his services to the country m

wou'd have the report m a few days, and then they would hear

Mi   PIERCE replied that if there were abuses <?uch as the
feenator conceived he was not the man to resist then exposure
no matter to whomoi hy what party commit'ed

Was   not   the   custom house filled by Democratic Whigs,

Mr M ANGITM    As far as I know
Mr BUCHANAN said that the office of First Comptroller was
given to that gentleman by Genera! Harrison, (whose decease
no man sincerely lamented more than he did ) and why had not
that gentleman been appealed to, to ferret out some of these
abuses? But let Senators inquire of the head of the Treasury
Department, and aseertim the extent of the abuses arid, when
they did so, if theydtdnotfind himasready as any Senatorio
correct them, he was mistaken m his own opinion Let them
have the facts, and then it would be time enough to crimínate
and recriminate, and he presumed that all abuses had ceased
since Mr Curtis went into office, but still they ought to lookaud
see how he had proceeded
Mr CIAY was very soiry that the Senator from Pennsylva
ma seated as he was near him and his (Mr Clay's) friend'',
had not, imbibed some of the principles which actuated the
Whigs upon his side of the chamber, and he had hoped that a
hi tie of those pnciples would have reached the Senator's hear*;
but the Senator wonld still attach himself to the other side, not
withstanding all his (Mr Clay's) kind attentions    They had,
however, gained something, and he gave the gentleman credit
for his candor m assenting to his (Mr Clay s) principles with
regard to the appointment of the commission    The Senator
was, so far as that was concerned, a good Whig and he corgia
tulated him on the conversion, and hoped that he would he re
stored to religion and fo patriotism once more    But the Senator
seemed to have got too much in his head about Presidential
candidates and, according to his (Mr Clay's) recollection, this
^am^waitwout never was a candidate for the Vice Prcs den
cy—-
Mr BTTCHA'NAN    You don't read the newspapers
Mi  CLAY said that he read too many of them, and that his
friend from Pennsylvania had been reviewing this subject with
too much scrutiny and mcetv  But whefe was thobleephsseye
of eternel  vie; lance that watched over the Treacuiy l>epart
ment \,hen Sam Swartwont was nominated foi the Vice Prest
dency, and pievious to which fiauds had been committed at
the custom house?   He would, however tdke the occasion to
say that he believed that Mr Van Burén wat, originally opposed
to the appointment of Mr Swartwout, and he i ad understood
that the Senator from Pennsylvania was also opposed to the
appointment, still the selection was made by the man of the
iron will    It was impossible foi gentlemen to escape from re-
sponsibility    less'e Hoyt was appointed by Mr Van Bum ,
but the appointment was made against the consent of tht- Sena
toi fiom New York    With regard to the incieiseof the cost of
collection at New Yoik, the per cent   was 1 43 under the col-
lec'or hip of Jonathan Thompson hut under that of Swartwout
it was 2 67    If the Senator would not he responsible for this,
wonld he answer foi Je^selloyt'?
Mr BUCÍUN-1N    No sir
Mr CLAY    What in the Devil are you respon&ible fort   He
was a thorough eoin  Loco T co, he never had "any Whig sym
pathy, and yet the Senator had no sympathy forHoyt    Does
the Senator charge the Whiss with responsibility?
Mr BUCHANAN    1 don't know
Mi CLVY said that he would be extremely happy to kiiowt

Mr   BUCII \ls AN "aid that the 8 nator fi om Kentucky had
