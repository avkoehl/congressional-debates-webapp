Brigadier-General DOUGLASS,

Mexico:

Have telegraphed Fisk about the First Iowa, and asked troops to watch from Keytesville. You have Bill Anderson. Use everything you can to destroy him.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

SAINT JOSEPH, July 30, 1864.

General J. B. DOUGLASS,

Mexico, via Saint Louis:

While you were in a state of siege at Columbia the storm was so threatening in the northeast that I ordered Colonel J. T. K. Hayward, Thirty-eighth Enrolled Missouri Militia, at Hannibal, into active service, and authorized him to call out such force as the emergency required, and direct movements until you could get to your headquarters. The colonel called citizens and militia and General Rosecrans sent him 500 stand of arms and ammunition; therefore, I fear we shall have serious trouble in the northeast unless we speedily pitch into the increasing guerrillas. Colonel Hayward had better be kept on duty until I can organize one of the volunteer regiments in the northeast. I have given him supervision over a sub-district, consisting of Scotland, Knox, Clark, Lewis, Shelby, Marion, and Ralls Counties, to be called the Sub-District of Hannibal. You will please make your orders accordingly. Authorize him to call out such militia as the exigencies of the hour may demand, and hereafter order him direct from your headquarters. Communicate with me freely by telegraph, and keep me well posted of the condition of affairs in your district. Are the bridges on the North Missouri railroad well guarded? Do you want to raise and command one of the twelve-months' regiments?

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT JOSEPH, July 30, 1864.

General J. B. DOUGLASS,

Mexico, via Saint Louis:

I have ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Draper, Ninth Cavalry Missouri State Militia, to Macon, as commander of a sub-district, consisting of the counties of Putnam, Schuyler, Adair, Linn, Macon, and Chariton, to be designated the Sub-District of Macon. You will please order accordingly. The remaining counties can be designated the Sub-District of Mexico, under such officer as you may select. Lieutenant-Colonel Caldwell will be at Mexico as soon as the bushwhacker hunt in Chariton is over.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

MACON, July 30, 1864.
