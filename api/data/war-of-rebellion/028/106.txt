gap is a strong position, and will require considerable force to dislodge them. He saw no infantry force.

The Eight Illinois captured 2 rebel cavalry soldiers this afternoon in the direction of Philomont.

Your dispatch of 12 m. received.* Shall send out in the morning in the direction you speak of. It is probable Longstreet passed through Ashby's Gap, and that they wish to hold Snickersville Gap for some purpose, as there is also a road from Snickersville to Aldie through Philomont. The road is good to this place, and it would be well to push some brigades of infantry this way.

Very respectfully,

A. PLEASONTON,

PURCELLVILLE, October 28, 1862 - 9.15 a. m.

Information, through Union people, places Hill's command at Upperville, and that troops have been passing through that place for some days. their pickets extend as far as the Snickersville and Aldie turnpike, over which they do not allow any one to pass north or south. I judge they are holding Snickersville Gap until they have time to pass through Ashby's, which is the next.

I have parties in the direction of Aldie and Middleburg, and shall soon know more. It would be well to send some infantry and force these fellows out of Snickersville Gap. My force is too small to do that and cover the roads in front. Indeed, more cavalry here just now would be of the greatest service.

I have the country covered to the Catoctin Mountains, this side of Leesburg. Everything appears quiet toward Leesburg.

Very respectfully,

A. PLEASONTON,

Brigadier-General, &c.

General R. B. MARCY.

P. S. - I sent you the map of Loudoun County last night. Did you get it?

PURCELLVILLE, October 28, 1862 - 1.10 p. m.

My scouts drove the enemy's pickets out of Philomont this morning, on the Snickersville and Aldie road, and they to the direction of aldie. A considerable force is reported at Middleburg.

The rebels have a signal station on the mountain to the north of Snickersville. Philomont is some 7 miles from here.

My people are pushing on toward Aldie for more information.

Very respectfully,

A. PLEASONTON,

Brigadier-General, &c.
