to move his command, and gave him orders to cross Stone's River and attack their flank. I also ordered Generals Wharton and Martin to attack their pickets, and develop any change they might be making. These arrangements occupied nearly all Wednesday night.

At daylight Thursday morning I started to reconnoiter the front in person. A portion of Colonel [Baxter] Smith's regiment drove in the enemy's pickets at Readyville. I got a fine view of their camps, and could count distinctly some two hundred tents. No doubt many more were there, as they seemed to extend in a wood near Stone's River. I could not see any fires, men, wagons, or horses. I therefore notified Lieutenant-Colonel [P. F.] Anderson, commanding Smith's regiment, and directed him to press in the pickets again, and report the result. When I hear from him, I will report again. I then rode along our line to Bradyville, and from thence, between our line and that of the enemy, to Fosterville, at which place I arrived at 4 o'clock this morning. After resting about three hours, I went to the front with General Martin, whose brigade had driven in the pickets yesterday, and found the enemy strongly posted.

We have out scouts this morning, and if I find any change, I will press out with the entire force at my disposal.

Some prisoners taken near Bradyville state that they were at the depot at Murfreesborough day before yesterday, and they thought but few troops were moving toward Nashville, but they thought some troops were moving toward Triune or Franklin.

Very respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

JOS. WHEELER,

Major-General.
