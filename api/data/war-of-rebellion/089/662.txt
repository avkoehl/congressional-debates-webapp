Major-General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: Eight deserters, two white men refugees, four negro men, and one woman came into my lines during the night. The deserters represent Wallace's, Gracie's, Ransom's, and Wise's brigades, of Johnson's division. Two of them are from Mahone's division, which they say holds the extreme right of their line or is in reserve. They all represent that the enemy are making no movement at present. The man who has been furnishing facilities for refugees and negroes to cross the river into our lines is among the party. The negroes state that the enemy are daily expecting a movement on our part. I send you a Richmond paper of the 18th, which they bright over. The Richmond paper states that when last heard from Sherman was at Jonesborough, on his road to Macon.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

One of our men of Gibbon's division penetrated the enemy's line at 11.30 last night through the abatis without detection. The enemy were found still occupying their picket-lines lightly, and the rifle-pits in the usual force. I merely send this as a corroboration of what the deserters and refugees stated this morning. I was aware of the facts before this, but was waiting official information.
