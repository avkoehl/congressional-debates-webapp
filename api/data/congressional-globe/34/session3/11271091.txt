But it is said that the government has done a
great deal to foster and aid railroad iron, and
something should be done to encourage railroads.
I deny that the Government is now doing any-
thing directly for railroad, or any other iron in-
terest. The Government has its revenue system,
under which foreign iron, together with a large
class of other articles, is charged a duty of thirty
per cent. The Government gets the money, be-
cause it must have it to pay its expenses; and the
iron enjoys the incidental aid. But the same re-
lation exists between the Government and nearly
every other interest in the country, and I am sure
it will not be pretended that the iron interest is
the least meritorious.
But, sir, I intend to show that the Government
has given more acres of land to railroad compa-
nies or aid 111 the construction of railroads, than
the railroads have paid dollars of duty into the
Treasury on their iron ! I shall show, also, that
the land thus donated is worth more money than
all the railroad iron on which duties have been
paid! I shall also make it appear that the rail-
roads to which vast donations of land were made
last summer, can and will most certainly become
the principal beneficiaries under the proposed law.
Not content with getting the land which belonged
to all the States, they now ask additional bounty.

I have made this calculation of the value of the
lands at the rate of $2 50 per acre. My best judg-
ment is that double that sum will be realized. I
have observed that Illinois lands are advertised at
rates ranging from five dollars to twenty-five dol-
lars per acre. At five dollars per acre these lands
will yield the enormous sum of $103,939,964.
Now, let us look at the other side of the picture.
The following table exhibits the quantity and
value of railroad iron imported into the United
States, annually, from 1831 to 1856, inclusive,
the amount of duties which accrued thereon, and
the aggregate quantity, value, and duty for the
whole period:

Thus it will be seen that the Government has
given 20,787,993 acres of land to aid in the con-
struction of railroads; whilst the total amount of
duties collected and retained in the Treasury, on
railroad iron, so much the subject of complaint
in certain quarters, is but $15,799,617, being a
fraction over an acre and a quarter for every dol-
lar of duty paid.
The total value of railroad iron imported into
the country from the beginning up to the present
time, as shown by the foregoing statement from
the Treasury Department, exclusive of duties,
was #58 ,091,793; making, with the duties paid
and retained, §73,891,410.
The total value of the lands given for railroad
purposes, valued at five dollars per acre, as shown
by the foregoing statement, is not only double
and treble the amount of duties paid on the im-
ported iron, but exceeds the amount of duties
and the total value of the iron by more than
thirty millions of dollars.
More than fifteen millions of acres of land have
been granted for railroad purposes during the
present Congress. And it must be obvious that
the railroad companies enjoying this vast bounty
would become, in addition, the principal benefici-
aries under the bill now pending. Complaints as
to the incidental protection given to the manufac-
turers of railroad iron by our revenue laws comes
with a bad grace from such quarters. I have no
means of ascertaining the facts; but I am just as
confident as a man can be of any proposition not
susceptible of demonstration, that if the truth
could be shown, the States receiving this large
body of lands have paid into the Treasury less
than twenty per cent, of the meager amount of
duties realized from railroad iron, as already
shown. And yet it is insisted that the settled
policy of the Government shall be disturbed, and
a cherished branch of national industry paralyzed,
if not crushed, to stimulate the construction of
railroads. Sir, the constructian of railroads is a
just and necessary enterprise. Railroad facilities
have added millions upon millions to the wealth
of our country, and have advanced all the ends
of civilization, and greatly enlarged the produc-
tive capacity of the nation. But no interest has
been more cherished; none has enjoyed near so
large a share of credit and generous confidence.
No other enterprise has accomplished so much
with so small an amount of real capital. Indeed,
sir, railroad bonds have almost monopolized the
money market for years past, to the exclusion of
all other interests. The iron manufacturer or
merchant, forced into market to raise money,
usually finds his principal competitor in some
railroad corporation, hawking its bonds about at
from fifty to seventy-five cents on the dollar.
But now, sir, I wish to show what progress
we are making in the manufacture of railroad iron;
and also to exhibit tlie relation that the home
production bears to the entire consumption, and
to the imported article;

The mills at Cleveland and Detroit have just
gone into operation, and are said to be of a ca-
pacity equal to 10,000 or 19,000 tons per annum.
Several other mills would have heen established
at more distant western points, where they are
greatly needed,as at Chicago and St. Louis, had
sufficient confidence been felt in the stability of
the present legislation. Three rolling mills at
St. Louis of capacity respectively of 6,000,3,000,
and 1,000 tons, would have been provided with;
apparatus for rolling rails, but for the same ap-
prehension.
The production of railroad iron in Great Britain
is about four times that of the United States. The
total iron production of that country per annum
amounts to about three millions of tons, and the
production of the United States to about one mil-
lion. Great Britain and Ireland has 8,480 miles
of railroad, and the United States 21,690 miles.
Which of these interests needs aid and stimulant
—the manufacture of iron, or the construction of
railroads? The annexed tables show that we
have excelled all Europe in the construction of
railroads:

In the United States at the same date, as I find

sources, there were 24,476 miles m operation, or
2,066 miles more than in all Europe !

I have always held the opinion, Mr. President,
that stability in the policy of the Government,
as to the rate of duty on foreign articles coming
in competition with our home productions, was
almost as essential as the nature of that policy.
Nothing is so paralyzing as instability. The pro-
; duction of iron is a heavy business, requiring a
i large amount of capital, and several years of time
