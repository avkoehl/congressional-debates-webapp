SPECIAL ORDERS.] HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 11, 1864-10 a. m.

The wounded men now with this army will be sent to Fredericksburg under the direction of the chief quartermaster and medical director. A train for that purpose will be organized under the immediate charge of Asst. Surg. H. A. Du Bois, U. S. Army, of the Artillery Reserve, consisting of the empty wagons of this army as far as possible and of such spring wagons and ambulances as are that kind of vehicle. It is expected that all who can walk will be required to do so. If any cases can speedily return to the ranks to duty they should not be sent away. The train of each corps or command when ready will be reported to Assistant Surgeon Du Bois, at Silver's, on the Fredericksburg road. The train should leave this afternoon and information should be sent to Dr. Du Bois of the number of wounded that will probably be placed in his charge, and the hour they will be ready to be moved, that no unnecessary delay occur. A sufficient number of medical officers and attendants, medical and hospital supplies, and two days' rations will be sent. The ambulance train, officers, surgeons, and attendants will return as soon as possible, their services being required with the army.

By command of Major-General Meade:

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
SPECIAL ORDERS.] HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 11, 1864.

Corps commanders are authorized to take advantage of the trains ordered to be sent to the rear to return to their respective States any regiments or independent companies whose term of service has expired, or will expire within a week from this date. Such regiments and companies will be ordered to report to the superintendent of the recruiting service, in the States to which they belong, for muster out and discharge. The term of service-three years-of a regiment or company, the Pennsylvania Reserves excepted, with respect to which organization a special decision has been given, will be reckoned from the date of muster into the service of the United States. In computing the term of service of a regiment, when the companies were mustered in at different dates, corps commanders are authorized to compute the term of service from an average date, but they will satisfy themselves in all cases as to the actual date of muster in of an organization before sending it home for discharge.

By command of Major-General Meade:

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
