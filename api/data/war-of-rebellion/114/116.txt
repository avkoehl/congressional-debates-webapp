Captain WILLIAM McMICHAEL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the Missouri.

SIR: I inclose herewith a remarkable document presented at our out-guards to-day by Captain George of the rebel army. Captain George is permitted to go to Saint Louis as a prisoner on parole to report to the general commanding the department for his decision.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. S. --Captain George since my writing the above states that he is not nor has he been in the Confederate Army. He was a Camp Jackson prisoner since which he has not taken up arms. He now simply claims the right under the Price-Fremont exchange* to return to his family in Saint Louis and should he desire to do so to join General Price and the Missouri State troops.
