for the liberation of MoLeod, and that gentleman had himself
moved to print the communication received in answer to
that call, and refei it to the committee of which Mr P had
been appointed chairman It was by that gentleman's motion
that the correspondence had been thrown on Mr P's hands
Nor should he ever forget that the motion had been accompa
med by the mover with some pretty bellicose remarks, which
had been followed by others m a still higher strain from another
gentleman from New York, now at the head ol the General
Post Office, ¡Mr Granger J Mr P had risen at the time, and
entreated gentlemen to keep quiet, intimating that very inte
resting questions might grow out of the communication re-
ceived, and thatamoie reserved and prudent tone should be
observed m regaid to them A gentleman from Kentucky on
his left [Mr Underwood] had then risen and delivered a very
remarkable speech, indeed, on the motio-i of reference, m
wmen he had chalked oat an outline of what the report ought
to contain, and had declared that the whole nation would hold
Mr P responsible for the tone and positions of any report that
might be presented
Ihusit had been entirely by the act of gentlemen on the
other side in politics that Mr P and the committee had been
made parties in the matter He had thought it, at the time, a
course somewhat impolitic %nd prematuie, but the case had
been thrown upon him, and that with very solemn warning too
as to his responsibility under it And was he, when placed m
such circumstances, to shrink fiom his duty? The Speakei
had placed him at the head of an important committee gentle
men on the other side had ehosen to make agitating speeches,
and had then thrown the papéis into his hands to be reported
on Mr P was sensible the question was of a delicate nature,
and he had been desirous of waiting till the trial of McLeod
Rh mid have been decided, arid although he had been held up be
fore the nation by the party leaders in that House and out of it,
and by a )e uitical party press of this city as an agitator, prepared
to scatter firebrands through the country, he had urged the mex
pediency of pressing the question to hasty action at that time
But, instead of giving time for the trial of McLeod, the gentie
man from New York, [Mi Fillmore j and a colleague of his,
not now in this House, [Mr Monroe,] had called upon Mr P
for a report, adding that the country wasjexpecting and looking
foi it at his hands Well did he knew that a thousand hireling
presses stood ready to de iou ce him as timid and cowardly,
and as not daring to take that lofty stand which became a
country jealous of its rights and well able to maintain them
Mr P bad accordingly produced the report, but it had been
prepare 1 an i presented without a word of consultation with
the Admnistiation then at the head of affairs, he discharged
them horn every thing like the remotest intention of casting an
em.bairast.mg question upon those who were to succeed them
in the possession of power It was due Mr VanBuren and his
Administration, if there were any blame to b** attached to the
report, to say that he, Mr Van Buren, must not bear it Foi
Mr Pickens knew the delicacy of his situation in relation to the
administration about to comeinto power at that time-hehad
therefore not consulted the tht,n President, directly or indnect
ly, or any membei of his Cabinet—nor had he consulted any
one m or out of power, except his colleague on the committee
He did not wish any public nv>n either in or out of the Cab.
net, to beai any ol the blame of that report W hatever blame
was to be attached o it it must fall on him (Mr Pickens)
entirely, an 1 no gentleman ever saw it, or knew its substance,
except the committee, until it was read to tin  House At least
it never was to Mr Ps knowledge This was due to the late
Administration a^ they had been traduced by a thousand de
magogues, for attempting to embauass theu successors, nor
withstanding he (Mr P ) had made a similar declaration upjn
the reception of the íepor , v. he i it was first read in the House
No' sir, it wa=? not because tne report was impolitic that
it was denounced—it was because it was true, every woid
of it
Yes, «tr1 those whip er editois and drivelling oiatois, who
Uveas whining sycophants upon powei, may denounce that
report, but while there is spirit in the laud to vindícate the
country s lights, that report wi'l find a response in everv fiee
man's heart I should have basely betrayed my country's
honor, if I hid shrunk from the responsibili íes that had
been tniown around me by the action oí this Houoe The
principles m that leport were punciples which gentlemen now
in the majority nere had never oenied Mr P challenged them
now lo rise and deny the facts there stated oi any one of them
They hal never been denied ei h*r by the finish pres^, or in
the Paihamentaiy deba'es They had denounced the repoit,
not because it s ated what was not true, b jt what was true, be
cau«e it called public attention, both here and ther , to the am
bition of the British Govern nent, and to the danger arising to
all other nation*, irom the growth of the aggie *ive policy of a
great mi naiy powei that seemed about to uvetshaduw the
eaith It was this which had wodnded the national pride It
was this which stuck m her dignity, and produced so stioig a
feeiins against the report
M- P complained that altioneh all his portion in the matter
had been forced upon him bv the Whigs themselves, he had
been de íeunced by a tnousand demagogues, and by ten thousand
demagogues, and by te i theu and abandoned presses, as an agi
tator, seeking to bu 1 inebrands m evey diiettion an I rpcklpss
of kindling the flames ol was between two great a id powerful
Christian nations What could he ha'e done le  l Was he
basely to lefuse t) vindicate his ountij s right , when it had
been made his official durv to sus am hei hoior^
He could no entire ya^iep with hi* colleague [Ml Rhett]
in what he had said as tú i he issue between the cu u ntnes being
such that ore or o hei of thein mu«t recede or sacrifice it-,
honor He considere 1 the tlermnd by Mr 1 ox as having been
made in a íemarkably cauti >u> mamiei The language was
guarded, and he did not eonsi Id it as pieclu ling all adjus mc it
of the question without luectly iban lomng the gioumMaken
Great delicacy ind eaution weie manifest in the choice of Ian
guage, and Mr P dil not think the Government so enure y
committed as his coileaac sceme i to suppose
Mr Pickeks thei alluded to the íecent decision of the Su
preme Couit oí New York anl'uid it was an able opinion
thatnevei coi Id be g inward hete ji hi Gieat Britain He
trusted that Mel eo 1 would be tne i it wasdie to the inde

he hoped that he wojld have a fan hearing—ind above all it
wa^duetothepeop eoi New Yoik— to their character—to our
iiee'and Glorious institutions—i hat he should have in impartial
trial
Mr McKEON ruse to speak
Mr MORGAN lose to a question ol order
Mr McKEON begged him to wait until he had said some
thing fiist
Mr MORGAN said his object was not to interfere with his
colleague, but he íaised the point now that the chair migbt de
termine whether debate on the McLeod affair was in order on
the forufication bill
Mr McKEON knew that it was a question on which the
country felt deeply He approved of Mr Pickens's report,
fully and heam¡y Hebtushe 1 to near any difference of opinion
as to the principles ol that document It was worthy of the cha
ractcr of the country, and it did not become us to quail before
the insolent and arrogant powei of Great Butam
Mr McKeon had no idea that Great Britain would be so
anxious (o declare war against us The great interests she
had at stake would induce her to considpr well before she war
red against this country, even if McLeod be not released or
acquitted accoioing to her request ¡?he must have learned
before this that we were not to be intimidated Mr Fox had
demanded the immediate lelease of McLeod That had been
denied He sent home for instructions and from England he
received orders to again demand McLeol's libeiaaon He
again wa-- told that thK mm could not be íeleased Mr Fox
must have patience He had already waited since last Novem
ber, when McLeod was ímpnsioned McLeod was in the hand's
of the judiciary of the *5ta c of New York, and out of theu
hands could not now be taken by any power on earth, with
out the consent of her authorities The Butish Minister must
know this to be the state of the case Mr McKeon wished
that the true situation of this case in New York should be
known It wasj n >t tne subject of party division in New
York
Mr BRONSON of Mame ro c to a question of order, and said
he was not to be put down
Mr McKEON said he wished the gentleman to tell him what
was m ordei
Mi BRONSON said he must confine himself to the f u tífica
tions in the bill
The House now peimitted Mr McKeon to pneeed in
order
Mr McKEON The Executive of tnat State- had a cone
spondence with the Executive Depai tment of the United States
and approved of the course of Mr Va i Burén a d Mi lursyth
The Legislature of that Xatp hal ippioved fie course of the
Governor of the state, and now we have evidence that the Ju

United States Mi Forsyth, and of Goveinoi Sewaid, weie
correct, an f that McLeod must be trie 1—and tried he will be

two gentlemen from that State on it, but not one Jrojn
Pennsylvania^ nor from Delaware or New Jersey
Thus, sir, lb Pennsylvania, the second State in the
Union, arid whose metropolis is the third or fourth
in commercial importance, without a single representative
whose voice can be beard m the Executive councils of the na-
tion, or m any one of the important committees of this House
To her repiesentatives, therefore, on this floor, must she alone
look for the protection of her rights and interests Mr B said
he did not wish to be understood as intending to cast any cen*
sute upon the piesent President for the manner in which the
State of Pennsylvania had been overlooked or neglected m the
Executive councils, he did not considei him as j/ei fully re
sponsible for the formation of the Cabinet, as they had been
forced upon him
Mr PltOFriT here called Mr Brown to order, and a long
discu bion on order ensued, which occupied the commuted for
more than an hour
Itappearel that the Chair had not particularly noticed the
remark of Mr B relative to the Cabinet, and had decided that
the general tenor of Mr B's argument was relevant, and, there-
fore, m order
Mr PROFFIT took an appeal from the decision, and m re
ducmg the ground of the appeal to writing stated it as though it
rested exclusively on the reference to the Cabinet being forced
upon the Piesident, and the Chair was represented as having de
cided these words to be relevant and in order
lheCHAIR denied this He had not noticed the expres-
sions, if he had, he should have ruled them out of order, as irre
levant
Mi PICKENS warmly insisted on the right of every mem
ber to assail the Administration, either m its measures or mo
tives
The CHAIR admitted this He desired to be distinctly un-
derstood is sustaining the point of order as now presented by
the gentleman from Indiana, not on the ground that members
were not at nb**ity to discubs the formation of the Cabinet, gi
their measnips or motives, but simply because such a discus
^io i was not relevant to the pending amendment
After agieatdeal of desultory conversation—
Mr BROWN, took an appeal from the above decision of the
Chair, and said he impeached the motives of no one but merely
stated facts The force alluded to as having actuated the Pre
sident was such as the President had himsell acknowledged m
his, message—the force of previous arrangements made by
General Hain on and Mr B  read from the President's mes
age to prove the truth of what he had alleged
íhis second appeal was aigued at length i; y Messrs BROWN,
PICKiNS.PROJflll, D\WSON, MALLORY, and SAL-
ÍONSTALI,
When the question being put, the decision of the Chair was
sustained—iye¡s 71, noes not counted
Mr BROWN was then allowed to proceed, and said he sup
posed it would be in trier for him to show the piopnety of
the amendment he bad oflered, if n was not to speak of the
tabisiet or the commi tees By the vote of yesterday, all
appiopria ions for Fort Delaware on the Pea Patch had been
Hticken out i f tho bill, and it was evident none would be made
until the title to that island was secuied This would take
sometime and if the title was now settled, it would take some
vea«-s to rebui d the fort Under these cucumstances he would
a k the committee if it was right oi proper to eave the city of
