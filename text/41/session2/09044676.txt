Estimated expenditures by Post Office Department out of receipts

:
"■Note.—This item is explained as follows: The Post Office Department estimates were misunderstood by tho Treasury Department and erroneously printed in
the book of estimates. These estimates, as corrected by tho Post Office Department, arc as follows: •
Amount required to bo appropriated out of postal revenue $20,878,961 79
Amount required to be appropriated out of general Treasury   ;.  4,702,131 21
Amount required to be appropriated out of general Treasury lor steamship subsidy  725,000 00
Total  26,306,093 00

It will be seen that the balance in favor of
the estimates of the present Administration
for the next fiscal year over those made by
the last Administration for this fiscal year is
$8,098,245 12. It is but fair to state that this
difference is found by the Treasury Depart-
ment correcting their own mistakes in their esti-
mates submitted to this Ilouse to the amount
of §32,000,000. All these mistakes in the esti-
mates were made against themselves. There
is a correction also of the estimates made for
the present year by the last Administration,
an omission having been found of about nine
million dollars.
These corrections being made, the difference
between the estimates of the past year made
for this year and the estimates of this year made
for the next, is, as I have stated, §8,098,245 12
in favor of the estimates made in the first year
of the present Administration for the coming
year.
And now I will call the attention of the
House to the work of the Committee on Ap-
propriations. I promised, on behalf of the
committee, that, if sustained by the Ilouse,
they would reduce the expenditure, not only
below the estimates made for the next year, but
also below the appropriations made for the pres-
ent year. It was suggested, Mr. Chairman, that
The appropriations for the present year were
made at a very low figure for the purpose of
embarrassing the present Administration, and
also in view of a large unexpended balance.
However it may have been as regards the mo-
tive alleged, it is true that_the estimates were
made in view of a large unexpended balance,
and in many instances were actually below the
current balances, with the expectation that the
difference would be made up by appropriations
already on hand. It was with this fact before
the committee of the low figure at which these
appropriations were made for the present year
that they have addressed themselves to tho
work of redeeming the pledge which they made
of cutting down the appropriations, not only
below the estimates of last year, but also below
the appropriations which were made last year.
And I take some pride, Mr. Chairman, in
submitting the result to the House. The esti-
mates for the year ending June 30, 1S71,
exclusive of what are called permanent appro-
priations, were $155,090,727 62. For these
tho committee have reported to the House
appropriations amounting to $141,753,502 45,
giving a difference in favor of the appropri-
ations ieeornmended under the estimates
for the coming year of $13,043,225 17. The
appropriations for the present year were
$143,741,447 19. The committee have recom-
mended in the several bills which have been
submitted to the House, and all of which have
passed the House but the present one, appro-
priations for the coming year, as I have already
stated, of only $141,753,502 45, being a reduc-
tion from the appropriations for last year of
$6,987,044 74.
This, it will be observed, Mr. Chairman,
does not include the permanent appropriations,
such as those provided in the standing laws for
the payment of the interest upon the public
debt, the collection of the customs, and the
like. If these be added, in order to ascertain
the sum total of estimates on the one side and
appropriations on the other, we should have
the following result. Tho estimates for the
