who asks yon the favor of being allowed to apply hie torch to
your house, that he may show the skill with which he can
quench the flame, or like that of (he inventor of the life pre
server, who should corae to the captain of a ship in the midst
of the ocean, a 3d say to htm, "Captain, I pray you to allow me
to scuttle the vessel forthwith, that you and youi crew may en
joy the opportunity oftrymg the efficacy of my new patent
life preserver I assure you there is no danger, sink your ves
eel, and, *ake my word for it, you shall all reach the shore in
safety " bo the gentleman from Massachusetts may brn g us
m here aieportmoat ably drawn up, and one hat shall lully
satisfy this House and the lorty six men oí Haverhill fht the
Union of the States ought not just i ow to be dissolved, but m
ayearortwu new discontents may an e some ethers cuonof
tne Union may b come lists -untied and hiving their minds
soured, the firs thing that wi 1 i res"itits,elrds aremedv will
be to draw up a petition to Congress for a di^so'ution of the
Union All they hdve todo will betoerciose it to the genie
man from Massachusetts, an i he will feel himselt under the
most sacied obliga ions, htm which he cannot discha ge him
sell, to present it m tbsHoise and toe i the who e question
must he gone over again For one, I prefer to ree ton t etre
sent broad basis of the Unnn to relying on anyof theia
tiocmations of the gentlcifn fiom Massachusetts 1 had
rather bear the ills we have than fly to otl ers tha we know
not of
But supposing the memonal to he referred, and the gentle
man to repoitupon it, of whdtcoroi will tl e report be? Aie
we quite sure of that! lam inclined to flunk that thecomp e\ on
and tone of the repoit wi'ld^pend vei> much on what vein the
gentleman happens tobe mat the the time liahei think that,
if he should have been disciissu g the treaty making power and
its intervention from the di struction ofs tvery in 'he feotith, ti e
tenor of the report may not bes very favorable But if, on
the other hand, the gentleman should chinee to be m the vein in
which he was yesterday, when he disclaimed all coincidence
in the prayer of the petition, (a disclaimer I was very ilad
to hear,) then we might hope that the íepoit would be favor
able, and that he woald say to the petitioners die tirre is not
yet"
Now, my great objection to th s who'e procied ng is, that i is
calculated to familiarize the public mind with hei lea of bleak
lng up the Union The people of the United Mates know then
rights,and 'knowing dare man tain them Hiere is no
doubt or difficulty on that point The great t biects amy, and
aim of Congress should be to h°al, as f u as po sit Je, all local
disonlents anl soften andpntai end to ah "cctio a! iifel
enees and difficulties One gteat ettort ought to betopicvmt
such a crrus fiom evei arriving as might pi esent an nduce

and sectional jealous es and discontei t Wi en the n ghty
wave of levolution shall once n&e, you and f, and the gentle
man from Massachusetts, and his reports and our resolution",
will all be hut as so many feathers floating on its surface
Does it become us, then, to agitate the water? ¡shall we do any
act which shall encomage the people to calcu ate the value of
the Union and weigh in their m nds th" question of its dissolu
tion? Or shall we not rathei, in compliance with the sacied
advice of the father of his country, frown down the flr«t allu
sion to the subject?
I confess that, for one, I prefer to rest on things as they are
as long as I can, and wmle Í would not indulge any unnece a
ry distiusiin íegard to the gentleman lrom Massachusetts I
still think that hisaction would depend too much on the fell
logs of the moment to be willing to repose my confidence ori
him.   I have been too long accustomed                    _ „,
"To trace

and to anticipate then disturbance and contention I therefoie
invite the II >use to put an end to the subject, which they can do
effectually, if tney please Who wants ai argument m favor of
preserving the Union1 I see no indications oí a civil wai—I
heat of no armies in the field, no banueis of rebellion float ng,
no popular assemblies, no state ordinances, no committees of
safety There is not a ripple on the surface of th  wi le spread
nation Seventeen millions of people die quiet, and 11 a state
of perfect repose No, I beg pardon forty six men of Haver
hill think that the Union should be immediately issolved, but
with this deduction, the remainder of the seventeen millions
rest qui'e content with the Constitution [A laugh J For
whom, then, do we want an aigumuit! Tor the seventeen mil
lions, or ior the iorty six men of Hiverlul ? They I believe
insist 'per/as aut m fat that there shaP be an immediate
dissolution Well íeahy if it has Co  e to tha point, if the dis
satisfaction of these foitj ei\ nenof Haverhill has reached so
dangerous a point as, without an argument to control tnem, to
threaten us with thiowiog down the Union about our eais, I
think both a more idtional anda cheaper mude of proceeding
will be for this House to depute the h moiable gentleman fiom

these fotty six men assemble and let the honoiablo gentleman

I must be pardoned if I still en ertam some do ibt I am not
in favot of divulging secrets, oi repeating p rvate conveisa

ter of a somewhat public character from a man I do not per
sonally know, but who was once a Senator of the United
States,andwho lsthesonof a Senator of the United states, en
closing to me a letter written to a Senator by the gentleman
fiom Massachusetts, under date of the 15th Decernbei 1808
which I shall now take the liberty to read, having been not
merely authorized butierjuested by the writer of the letter to
do so Trie gentleman having resigned hi3 seat m the Senate

letter to a Mi Anderson, then a Senator fiom the State of Ten

' The event has shown that, in my calculation of the firmness
of the Senate I was not mistaken The system of submission
to Bntish insolence and usurpation, wh ch has been preached,
and prayed and resolved, and petitioned, and i emonstrated m
this pai t of the country for the last eighteen months, finds m the
Senate thanks be to God, the same mvincioie spirit of resist
anee which it found at the last session of Í ongre«s The will
and infliienc of my constituents has bad its full constitutional
lanse, and they have had the beet opportunity to manage their
