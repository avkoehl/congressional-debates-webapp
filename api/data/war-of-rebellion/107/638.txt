and reflects the highest credit upon the officers and soldiers whose energy and perserverance have accomplished it. The services of Captains Barstow and Willard, of the staff, cannot be too highly estimated, but much credit is due also to Major Brown, of the Staff, Captains Conrad, Shannon, Henry, and Feaster, of the Pennsylvania Reserves. Colonel Biddle and his officers, especially Lieutenants Andrews and Kennedy, of the Ninety-fifth New York. Also Lieutenants Kennedy, of the Ninth Pennsylvania Reserves; Lampman, of the Thirtieth New York; Rogers, of the Sixth Wisconsin; Uffendill, of Fourteenth New York; Sexton, of Second Wisconsin; Thomas, of Sixth Wisconsin; Harter, of Nineteenth Indians; Ramsey, of Eighth Pennsylvania; Pennypacker, of Fourth Pennsylvania, and many non-commissioned officer and privates who, in consideration of valuable services, have been detailed permanently as members of a construction corps for future operations of a similar character. The services rendered by E. C. Smeed, L. M. Wright, I. R. Nevins, G. F. Speer, W. R. Fulton, and Samuel Langmaid, civilians, and foremen in the construction of the work, must not be overlooked.

The above report is very respectfully submitted by,

This flood will inevitably retard any bridge operations. I will try to have one made to-day and I can cross my command on one.

General MARCY, Chief of Staff:

I have order another 100 men to Dispatch Station. The guard at the bridge does not belong to me. The details for fatigue are very severe upon my command. I have completed two bridges over the Chickahominy to-day and shall have two regiments employed to-morrow on the road through the swamp.
