VIENNA EXPOSITION.
Mr. SCHURZ. I have been directed by the
Committee on Foreign Relations, to whom
was referred the joint resolution (H. R. No.
170) to enable the people of the United States
to participate in the advantages of the inter-
national exposition to be held at Vienna in
1873, to report the same back with amend-
ments ; and I ask the unanimous consent of
the Senate for its immediate consideration.
No objection being made, the Senate, aa in
Coi&raittee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the joint resolution. In order to enable
the people of the United Stated to participate
in the advantages of the international exhibi-
tion of the products of agriculture, manufac-
tures, and the fine arts, to be held at Vienna
in the year 1873, the joint resolution appropri-
ates $100,000, or so much thereof as may he
necessary, for the purpose specified, which
sum is to be expended under the direction of
the Secretary ox State. The President is to
appoint a number of practical artisans, not
exceeding twelve, who shall attend the exhibi-
tion and report their doings and observations
to hint, and whose actual and reasonable ex-
penses, not to exceed $1,000 each, are to be
paid from the fund. The Governors of the
several States are requested to invite the
patriotic people of their' respective States i o
assist in the proper representation of the
handiwork of our artisans, and the prolific
sources of material wealth with irhich our
land is blessed; and to take such further
measures as may be necessary to diffuse a
knowledge of the proposed exhibition, and to
secure to their respective States the advant-
ages which it promises.
The first amendment reported by the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relajtiqna Was in line nine
bf sectioa one, u> strike out "one" and
insert " three*" so aa to. make the appropri-
ation $300,000. . â¢ "
Mr. CHANDLER. I hope that amend-
ment will not be adopted. I. am opposed to
the whole thing. We have appeared at these
expositions abroad in several instances and
have found that foreigners take possession of
our inventions and pay us nothing in return.
