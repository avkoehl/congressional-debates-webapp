had his headquarters, there is no necessity for keeping more than picket guards in the bottom lands in front. If this is so, it would relieve a large part of your force from under fire and leave them ready to assist any place where they might be required. It would enable you to hold a greater length of line and move the whole of the Army of the Potomac to the left. Please give me your views in this matter.
