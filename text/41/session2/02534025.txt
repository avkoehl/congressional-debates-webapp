crease; therefore there is no danger in reducing
taxation $50,000,000 a year without injury to
the credit of the Government, and then obtain
sufficient revenue to pay yearly the interest and
a reasonable portion of the principal of the
debt. This would be a great relief to the
people, and all classes of citizens, directly and
indirectly, would feel the good effects of it.
The very great inequality of the income tax
law now in force demands the attention of
members of this House, and when it is called
the most fair, just, equal, and popular tax of
all levied it must be that those who pronounce
it such have not properly examined it in all
its bearings or they would have discovered
its inequalities and actual injustice. From
the last annual report of the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue I take the following figures,
showing the proportions paid by the several
States and Territories of the income tax col-
lected during the fiscal year ending June 30,
1809. The figures give the net amounts credited,
a total of $120,064 0-1 having been refunded to
the several States:

Of this total of $8-1,109,829 28 iucome tax
over seventeen millions, or about one hall,
was collected in twenty of the two hundred and
thirty-five revenue districts, as follows :

Eighteenth district of Ohio  456,004 63
Fitteenth district of New York  431,235 38
Total  517,000,277 01
This leaves two hundred and fifteen revenue
districts to contribute the other half of the sum
total. Of these less than fifty paid over §100,000
each; about fifty paid from g&0,000to §100,000 ;
forty from $25,000 to £50,000; and about sev-
enty ranged from $25,000 down to a sum less
than $1,000.
A comparison of the above tables will ex-
hibit in a strong light the gross inequalities of
taxation under the present income tax law.
The first district of Illinois paid $1,686,602 75
against $646,887 66 paid by the other twelve
districts of the State combined; two districts
in Massachusetts, the third and fourth, paid
about as much as the remaining eight districts;
three districts in Pennsylvania paid more than
the twenty-one remaining, and the first dis-
trict paid more than the seventeen districts of
the State combined; one district in Rhode
Island paid more than the whole Stale of
Indiana; one district in New Jersey, the fifth,
paid more than twelve of the thirteen Illinois
districts combined, more than thirteen of the
New York districts combined, more than six-
teen of the Pennsylvania districts-combined,
more than the States of Iowa, Wisconsin, Min-
nesota, Kansas, and Nebraska put together,
aud more than the whole amount paid by the
States of North Carolina, South Carolina,
Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Texas,
and Arkansas, with a cotton ciop bringing them
over two hundred millions in gold. Only one
district in Illinois paid as high as $100,000, and
only one in Indiana, one in Iowa, one in Wis-
consin, one in Missouri, two in Michigan, and
five in Ohio reached that figure. It will require
the census figures of 1870 to show where wealth
is accumulating; the revenue returns on in-
comes serve only to show the direct receipts
above the $1,000 exemption.
According to the Commissioner's last annual
report California, with only three meuibeis of
Congress and about six hundred and fifty thou-
sand population, pays more income tax than
the States of Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Wis-
consin, Kansas, and Nebraska combined.
The little State of New Jersey, with her five
members of Congress and population of eight
or nine hundred thousand, and taxable prop-
erty in proportion, pays more income tax than
the wealthy State of Indiana, and almost as
much as the State of Ohio, more than any of
the large and populous States in fact, save New
York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Illinois,
and Ohio. New Jersey paid more than Indiana,
Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan,Wisconsin, Kansas,
Nebraska, and West Virginia combined, and
nearly as much as all the late seceded States to-
gether. When the taxable wealth of the great
Northwest shall be ascertained under the new
censusNew Jersey gains will be foundan insig-
nificant fraction in comparison, though all the
time-under the income tax law she is paying as
though her increase was the greater. During
the last seven years the State of New Jersey
has paid nearly eleven million dollars of income
lax. The people in my district and through-
out the State are getting uneasy under these
heavy, unequal, and unjust taxes.
Among the many letters received in regard
to the injustice of the income tax one says:
"A family resident here consists of two brothers
and two sisters, unmarried and of full ngo. They
jointly own real and personal properly worth more
than half a million dollars. Probably one third of
it is unimproved city lots, the bahvneo mortgages,
United States bonds, and other securities. _ They arc
entitled to deduct taxes on all bills tor paving, curb-
ing, and culvertmg, and an exemption of $1,000 for
each of them. The result is, the family pay about
fifty dollars income tax, the same as a clerk at a
salary of 82,000 without any property. Can there bo
justice in this? "
Mr. Speaker, it is time that justice was done
in this matter, that the unequal burdens borne
by the people were stopped.
Bearing on this subject, 1 take the liberty to
quote from the Washington coirespondenee of
the Newark Daily Advertiser, the writer having
evidently very carefully examined this whole
matter, which presents very valuable facts and
statistics, and can be considered leliable :

"Until the consus of iSTOshall be taken, it will not
be practicable to determine tho relative advance of
tho respective Slates in population and material
wealth ; but it'tho ascertained increase between the
years 3350 and I860 bo anywhere nearibe measure,
or the grea.t expectations of the rapidly growing agri-
cultural States of tiie West be any guide, tho older
States will next year be found by the census marched
far behind in both increase of population and aecu*
mulated property, real and> personal. Hence, in
comparing the percentage of income tax paid by tho
respective States, tho new States, or the great agri-
cultural districts ot tho country, cannot suffer injus-
tice in tho uso of the ratables of 1860 as the basis of
comparison, as under it tho same rate of increase is
allowed for all, though few will claim anything like
as groat an increase in the old States as in the mighty
West. Upon this liberal basis the following tablo
will exhibit tho pcrcentageof population and of real
estate and personal property, winch should at least

than twice as large as tbo total real and personal
