Public Building at Syracuse, New York—Mr. Due.ll.
Ho. of Reps.
cover nearly one thousand acres> The State
reservations occupy about seven hundred and
fifty acres, and private individuals own about
two hundred acres; the remainder is wasteland.
The State of New York, through the superinten-
dent of the salt springs and his deputies, sinks
the wells, pumps the water, and distributes it
among the manufacturers, inspects the salt,
weighs and brands the packages into which the
salt is packed, and collects the State duties.
A very large sum of money is invested in the
manufacture of salt.
There are no less than forty-four thousand
vats for making coarse salt by evaporation by
the heat of the sun, each vat being sixteen by
eighteen feet. There are three hundred and
sixteen fine salt blocks, where salt is artificially
made by boiling; there are also four large mills
where table and dairy salt is manufactured.
The vats and blocks are valued at $4,700,000.
The State wells and pump-houses are valued
at $200,000, and there is an actual cash cap-
ital employed in conducting the works of
$1,450,000, making in the aggregate $6,200,-
000 invested in these salt works. But, Mr.
Speaker, their interest to the city of Syracuse
does not rest here. The salt-works give employ-
ment to five thousand men ; they pay anuually
over eighty-six thousand dollars in royal-
ties to the treasury of the State of New York,
$80,000 for canal-tolls, and $350,000 for freight
on lake, river, arid canal. An enormous trade
is carried on in the articles necessary for pack-
ing the salt, as well as in coal and lumber.
In the year 1870 there were used 200,000
tons of coal, 23,000,000 barrel staves, 7,000,-
000 barrel-head pieces, 12,000,000 barrel
hoops, 200,000 yards of bag cloth, 2,000 kegs
of packing nails, and 3,000,009 feet of lum-
ber for repairs to vats, sheds, reservoirs, and
buildings. Nearly nine million bushels of salt
are made every year, and even this amount
might be largely increased, as the wells have
a capacity for producing annually fourteen
million bushels. The value of the salt annu-
ally manufactured at the Onondaga salt springs
foots up at over twenty-five hundred thousand
dollars. And I state another fact, Mr. Speaker,
which has a direct bearing to show the justice
of the claim I now make for this appropriation
of $250,000 for a Government building at Syra-
cuse, and it is this: under the internal revenue
act in force from 1862 to 1870, the manufac-
turers of salt at Syracuse paid into the Treas-
ury of the United States, in the way of tax upon
sales of salt and special taxes as manufacturers,
more than eight hundred thousand dollars.
I append a statement showing the number
of bushels of salt made at the Onondaga salt
springs from June 20, 1797, down to and in-
cluding the year 1870, to illustrate the great
importance of the salt-producing interest to
the city of Syracuse :

Mr. Speaker, although I have occupied con-
siderable time in explaining and itemizing the
facts connected with the manufacture of salt,
this is but a small part of the business of Syra-
cuse. There is hardly an article which is
called for, or which has a sale in market, which
is not manufactured in that city. Its rolling-
mills, machine-shops, iron-works, glass-works,
factories of various kinds, require a large
amount of capital, and give employment to
thousands of mechanics and laboring men.
The wholesale trade of'the city is estimated at
$65,000,000, and is divided among some forty
branches of industry. I submit a carefully
prepared estimate, showing the wholesale trade
of Syracuse:
Dry goods    18,000,000
Groceries and provisions 10,000.000
Oil  4,000,000

The city of Syracuse has a deep interest in
the subject of general education. All classes
of her citizens, regardless of political or social
prejudices and preconceived theories, have
united in the purpose of securing to all the
benefit of free schools, and cheerfully respond
to the taxation necessary. She may point
with pride to her schools, her seminaries, and
her university, as an honorable proof of the
liberality of her citizens, and that the cause
of education is among the first objects of
public interest.
Mr. Speaker,' my colleague from the Albany
district, [Mr. Perry,] who urged upon the
House some days ago the claims of Albany to
a public building, remarked that the citizens of
Albany are a philanthropic people. He spoke
of the hospitals and orphan asylums of that
city in words of just commendation, and I
desire to say here and now that Syracuse is
not behind the capital of our State in the num-
ber and character of her charitable instita-
tions. While business prospers, and thriftfol-
lows industry, her people are not absorbed in
mere selfish enjoyments; the fountains of
benevolence and charity opened during the
war now flow in other channels for the benefit
of suffering humanity. Private munificence
was never more liberal in its endowments, and
every good cause is supplied with warm-hearted
and zealous friends. The people of Syracuse
are ever ready to incur any expense that neces-
sity demands to make most ample provisions
for the poor and dependent classes.
I desire in this connection, Mr. Speaker, to
allude to a circumstance which will illustrate
better than anything else the character of that
people for benevolence. Before the gr'eat fire
at Chicago had been subdued the citizens of
Syracuse were called together by the mayor,
and at that meeting a resolution was unani-
mously adopted requesting the common coun-
cil to bond the city in the sum of $25,000 for
the relief of Chicago. The request was promptly
complied with, and the further sum of $25,000
having been added by private subscription, the
whole was forwarded at once to the suffering
people of that unfortunate city.
I will now proeeed, Mr. Speaker, to give
some facts to show that the interests of the
Government require the erection of a public
building at Syracuse, as contemplated by this
bill. It is absolutely necessary that there
should be a suitable building in which the
postal business of the United States may be
properly transacted at Syracuse. This is the
most important distributing office in the State
ot New York, except the city of New York,
and has the poorest accommodations of any
distributing office in the State. The post
office is kept in a block of which a portion
of only forty by fifty feet is rented to the Gov-
ernment for its use as a post office. In thia
space arc crowded the clerks, letter carriers,
local agents, besides all the necessary fixtures
and other matters connected with a large post
office. There is no room for the postmaster,
nor private room of any kind for the use of
his deputy or of special agents, and no store-
room or cellar-room.
In order that the House may understand
something of the amount of business trans-
acted at this post office, I submit an official
statement from the postmaster on that sub-
ject. It is for the year ending December
31, 1871:
Letters received through the mails and delivered
by carriers     1,543,500
Add number delivered at the office  251,525
Total   -1,775,025
Number of local letters received and deliv-
ered by carriers      147,732
