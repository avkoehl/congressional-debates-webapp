FORT MONROE, VA., March 28, 1866.

Major General NELSON A. MILES,

Commanding District of Fort Monroe, Fort Monroe, Va.:

SIR: I would respectfully report that the health of Jefferson Davis is better than at last report. He complains less of the fullness of head, and he has slept much better since the matting has been placed upon the floors surrounding his prison room, thus deadening the tramp of the sentinels. His appetite, too, seems to be improving somewhat.

C. C. Clay is decidedly improved since last report. His diarrhea has sufficiently diminished to warrant the statement that he has recovered from it. He is improving in strength and appetite, though he has some asthmatic symptoms, which are not, however, as severe as those he had prior to having received the parole of the fort.

Your obedient servant,

GEO. E. COOPER,

Surgeon, U. S. Army.

POST HOSPITAL, Fort Monroe, Va., April 4, 1866.

Major General N. A. MILES,

Commanding Military District of Fort Monroe, Fort Monroe, Va.;

SIR: I report the health of state prisoner Jefferson Davis to be as on last report. The only complaint made by him is of muscular weakness and insomnolency.

C. C. Clay seems to be improving both in health and spirits. The parole of the fort has been of great benefit to his general health.

Your obedient servant,

GEO. E. COOPER,

Surgeon, U. S. Army.
