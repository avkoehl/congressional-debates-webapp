I determined to move with my whole command to that place, and accordingly set out on the morning of the 8th. After proceeding a few miles a formidable blockade was encountered, through which it was necessary to cut a passage. General Duffie reported his command as unfit for further operations, as his infantry had but one day's rations, and was so exhausted as to be able to march only 10 miles per day. My own infantry was encumbered with the prisoners, captured property, and materiel.

I therefore ordered General Duffie to retire to Meadow Bluff, and Colonel Moor, with the Twenty-eighth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, Tenth [West] Virginia Volunteer Infantry, and Keeper's battery, to return to Beverly, taking with him all the prisoners and such of the wounded from the battle of Droop Mountain as could be transported. Colonel Moor brought from Hillsborough 55 of our own and 1 rebel transportation, Assistant Surgeon Blair, Tenth [West] Virginia Volunteer Infantry, and supplied them with all the rations, hospital stores, and medicines which could be spared. His command reached Beverly on the 12th, bringing with it all the prisoners, property, &amp;c., which had been captured up to the arrival of my command at Lewisburg.

With the cavalry, mounted infantry, and Ewing's battery of my command, I moved via White Sulphur Springs to near Callaghan's passing through the battle-ground of Rocky Gap on my way. At White Sulphur I retook the wounded of my command who had been left after the battle of Rocky Gap in August last.

At Callaghan's on the morning of the 9th, I learned that General Imboden, with from 900 to 1,500 men, was at Covington on his way to re-enforce Echols at Union. Not deeming his command of sufficient importance to delay my march, and knowing the impossibility of bringing him to a fight, I sent two squadrons of the Eighth [West] Virginia Mounted Infantry, under Major Slack, to drive him away from my line of march. This was accomplished after a sharp skirmish, in which Imboden was reported wounded and 1 lieutenant and 20 men of his command were captured.

From Callaghan's I moved by Gatewood's up the Back Creek road to Franklin; the main body of the command moved through Hightown, while the Fourteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry went through Monterey and joined me about 8 miles beyond that place. At Hightown I met Colonel Thoburn, with a brigade of infantry and two pieces of artillery, whom I directed to return to Petersburg. My command reached Petersburg on the 13th, where it was supplied with rations and forage. On the 17th, I arrived at New Creek, bringing with me about 150 captured horses and 27 prisoners, exclusive of thos e which were sent from Lewisburg with Colonel Moor. Several hundred cattle were captured on the march.

I inclose a list of the losses of my command.* I regret to say that upon it you will find the names of Lieutenant Weaver, of the Second, and Lieutenant Daniels, Battery B, First [West] Virginia Light Artillery, who fell before the enemy in the performance of their duty. Captain Coburn, of the Third [West] Virginia Mounted Infantry, was also fatally wounded.

The conduct of the officers and men of my command, with a few exceptions, was excellent. The success of the infantry attack was
