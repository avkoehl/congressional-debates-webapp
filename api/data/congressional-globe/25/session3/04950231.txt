error by the decision of its present course A new
crisis hasaruved I stand upon the cot respond-
ent between Mi FoisythandMr Fox, to which
this affair has given r se Whatevei misconcep
tion there may have been concerning this,on the
pait of any oificer of the Butish Government, or
in this coun ry, there is, at any rate, no such
agreement Gieat Btitain can plead misconcep-
tion no longer She must now enter upon a new
couise of measures She has not exercised
hitherto exclusive 01 foicible jurisdiction on the
Aroostook, she must now cease to claim the light
to do so heteaftci, undei this pietendcd agiec-
ment, which the United States nevei made And
the conclusion to which I come on the whole mat-
ter is this the undei standing actually had has
either been misconceived, oi willfully misintei-
preted, by the British authorities or officers in
Ameuca It does not seem even to have been
so understood in England At the veiy outset of
the alian, in 1827, the proposal for an undei stand
nig, it appeals, came from Mi Canning, who
" suggested the propuety of abstaining on both
sides, pending the suit, fiom any act of sover-
eigntyovei the contested temtory " Heie is//tc
suggestion ot ihe undo standing And whatevei
¿latements of it occur in the coriespondenoe of
the subordinate functional íes of the two Govern-
ments fiomthat time to this, I have a lcmaikable
dcclaiation, made by Loid Palmerston, the pres-
ent Foieign Secietaiy, in n debite in the House
of Commons, on theJ4th April, 1S37, as I find it
reponed in the London Times

These two declarations are each very different
fiom that ot Sn John Hatvey, who undertakes
an asseition by foiceofexclusivt juiisdiction, not
only unsuppoited by, b it in ditect opposition to
the deelaiauon of Loid Palmetston In resisting
this pielension of Sn John Harvey, the Govern i
mint of Maine is i ght,as he is wholly wiong in
miking the ¡uetensiin it is a pietension which
cmnot and will not be tolci ttcd by the United
fbtates
In regard to the conduct of the government of
Maine, theie is one important consideration to
be borne in mind      There is a question of State
lights, at the bottim of this      I hive heard it do
n ed whether Maine had any con litutional ¡now ei
to do what she has done     Such is not my retd
ing of the Constitution    Each State has an inde   ,
feasible light to the  integrity of her teintoiy,
which the United States cannot cuitad but with
her  consent     Each  State   has  an  indefeasible
n ht to delend the integrity in arms, if need be,
oy her own force, if that ot the United States be
not at hand    Struck, she must md should stiike
Such   is  the   s-acied   right  of  self preservation,
sanctified by the great chii*ci of the Union, and
by the fust pimeiples of human action, winch ire I
supeiior to all the constitutions on earth     The
Constitution contains the following cliuse
" No State «hill, vvi lout the eoi^ent ot Cmgte lay
anv duty ot tonnage keep troops or <Unps of war m time
of peace, enter into my agieemem or compact with anuther
State or with a foreign Power or engage 11 uar unless ct
ually miaded, or in such imminent danger as mil not admit
of delay "
I shall not inquire whether the Governor and
Legislature of Maine did or not stait in the best
possible mannei     That is a question passed    The
wheel of time hasiolled over it, and, in the piog
ress of events, we have i cached another and a
gi^ver issue      Sir John Hancy is in the act of
inv idi i  the Statt of Maine, and invading it un-
dei pretensions which neithei the peace nor the
h nor of the Uní ed States  can tamely enduie
The State of Maine possesses, under these en
cunislmcs, full constitutional power to aim in
hei own defense, and to withstand and repel hos
Ule invasion     The power is expressly given to
her by the Constitution, and herein, at least, the
law is not silent amid the dm of arms She had
the power, and she has judged, as she might and
must, whethei oi not the exigency had airived
foi the exercise of the power, and, having armed
heiself, has invoked the aid of the Federal Gov-
ernment in defense of the integrity of hei own
soil and that, of the United States
Of the pait which it now becomes the duty of
Congress to perfoim, I shall say nothing atpies-
ent, because I do not wish to anticipate oi pre-
jadgo the action either of the Committee on For-
eign Allans or of the House
Mt   PICKENS lose and said he desned to
i trespass foi as short a time as possible upon the
attention of the House     The subject under then
I consideiation was painfully delicate and deeply
lntcicsting He desired to say nothing that would
precipitate  u , directly  or indirectly, into that
I which all wise men would like to avoid Mr P
legietted that gentlemen had thought it necessaiy
to go into the details of the past histoiy of this
contioversy, he would íathei avoid thatatpies-
ent He had listened with piofound attention to
what had fdlen fiom the venerable gentleman
from Massachusetts, [Mi Adams,] and he en- |
UK ly agieed with him in one obseivation partic
ulaily, and that wis, thatat piesent he was will-
ing to " foigot the post " It was a íem nk full
of wisdom and patuotism He also desired to
forhe ii an examination or censure of what had
occurred in the pi ogress of this unpleasant con
tioveisy Mi P would prefer to meet the pres-
entstate of the question—to stand upon the issues
now made—andactundei the cucumstanceswith
which we were suiioundtd The gentlemm
[Mr Adíms] had obseived that he undcistood
the message of the Picsidint, now befiue us, I
made apioposition to lea\ethe adjustment of this
contioveisy to the governments of Maine and
New Btunswick, tLc In this he thought the
gentleman hid misundeistood the message            I
Mr  P  had had no oppoitutnty of judging Us
contents, except by the hasty reading given of it
by the Clerk at the desk, and he had conveised j
with no gentleman as to its substance, but he un-
derstood that part which the gentleman refened I
to as rathei advising and expressing a hope that I
both the Governors of Maine and New Biuns
wick might pause, and that those who had been
captuied on  both  sides  might  be  mutually re- |
leased, and that the militia oideied out might be
r eaceably dishandi d    It was rathet an expression
of desne that things might tike this direction,
and the affan   be terminated, thin leaving it, as
was supposfd, to New Biunswick and Maine to
settle and adjust it     I his was his undcistanding
of that part of the message
But the gentleman [\Ii Advms] had pronounced
the message too picific foi him Now, the pacific
ter dency of it''if it were so) was to him (Mi P )
Us high at recommendatu n He thought it was
due to the dignity of the matters involved that it
should be pn ific He could see no objection to
i s pacific character at piesent He depiecated
the allusions mad to the piobabihty of wai, we
should move with delicacy on that point He
hid listened with deep pain to that poition of the
remaiksofthegentk man fiom Maine [Mi LvvNs]
which intimated that, if the Piesidcnt supposed
that peace could be piescrved, he was mistaken
The gentleman hid sa d it was nov/ too late tor
that, for the conflict of aims had iheady taken
place, in all piobabihty, on the fiontiei He
hoped and ti usted tint m this the gentleman was
mistaken     Others had mide similar íemaiks
He earnestly desired that peace might be pie
served, and he had no doubt it could be    Imbe
cihty and indecision now, at this junctuie, would
bung wai,  but decision and firmness would pie-
serve peace and our honor too   As to the contro   ,
veisy of the past, he would desue to say but little,
he would, however, take this occasion to say that
he had examined it, and, as to the question of the
location of the tiue line, undei the tieaty of 1783
there was not a juiy of twelve men, even m Lng
land, who, under oath, could lefuse us a veidiet
upon the facts of the case, it was a question too
cleai for contioveisy     And as to the possession
of t'lcpnticulii section ofcountiy wheie the con
flict hid taken place, it hid f)i Unity yeais bem
settled by our citizens undei giants iiom Massa-
chusetts. The pretensions of exclusive junsdic-
tion set up by Gre it Britain arose from the ground
that she considered our soveieigntyas commenc-
ing only fiom the Declaration of Independence
oi the tieaty of peace, and that, theiefore, in all
disputed terntoiy, she would exeicise jurisdic-
tion fiom the claims of prior soveieignty This,
Mi P considered lathei a fiction The treaty
of 1783 was signed by independent equals
He would here say m the past Mame had beea
wronged—deeply wronged—by whom he would
not now say, but he would say she had also
wlonged herself
The gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr Cash-
ing] had alluded to other points of difficulty be-
tween us and Great Britain, and to one in which
the South was vitally interested Yes, he held
in his hand the correspondence aecently published
between the Butish Cabinet, through Lord Pal-
meiston, with our Minister and Government, it
related to the vessels that had been driven by
storm upon the coast of Bermuda, with slaves
from this section of country, destined foi New
Orleans, and which had been seized by the British
authonties and liberated
The SPEAKER intimated that it was aot in
ordt r
Mr PICKENS said he did not intend to dis-
cuss it The Butish Cabinet, in this coirespond-
ence, had taken the ground distinctly, and so
communicated it to out Government, that they
could not, undei any cucumstances, recognize the
light of piopeity in peisons 1 hey had conse-
quently, in the case of one of the vessels, (the
Lnterprise,) postively lefused indemnity, because
it happened aitei then act of emancipation to the
West India Islands.
Mi P had peiuü,ed this correspondence with
the deepest indignation Tne Government had,
by it, set up the light to decide for us in what
our propei ty should consist It stiuck a high-
handed blow at our independence But he would
foibeai to pursue the subject, and only say that,
rather than submit to its anogant assumptions,
he would prefer to see the country, from the Fa-
tapsco to the Sabine, laid low m one smokmgrum.
This was one amongst the many points at issue
between us and Gieat Butain, to which the gen-
tleman [Mi Cushing] had alluded The con-
tioversy on the noitheastern boundary had pre-
sented a tangible issue before us, and, he thought,
the moie decided the movements were, the better
for the peace of the two countues He thought
the stiong militaiy movemenis of Maine, if con-
ducted with judgment, would tend to prevent
conflict, that if only small numbers on both sides,
and equally divided, weie to meet, there would
be gieatei danger of conflict of arms He, there-
foie, differed liom the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts furthest fiom him [Mr Lincolv] in his
censuie ujaon the Governor of Maine in his call
foi a stiong aimed force
Mi I INCOEN said that Mr P had misun-
derstood him, that he íeferred to the fiist move-
ment to drive oil trespasseis, and meiely said
that that was i milnaiy movement
Mi PICKENS was glad to understand this
from the gentleman, and what he intended to ad-
vance was, that the most decided movements at
this junctuie would be, in the end, the most
peac able He deprecated anything that might
firally tend town between us and Gieat Butain,
he hoped theie would be no occasion to make
that last sad appeal But if it was to be foiced
upon us, he would pledge his all upon the con-
test In this mattei, to a transient observer, at
fiist sight, Maine might seem to be alone inter-
ested, but we aie all bound together under a sa-
cred compact, we beiong to a common Confed-
ciacy,and have a common country, and although
I repiesent a remote section, yet the cause of
Maine is our cause And if wai must come,
(which may God in His mercy avert1) although
it would be desolating m its effects to my sec-
tion of country, yet we had met such events be-
fore Oui treasme hid been advanced, and our
blood shed, in a war for those who weie remote
from us we could do it again, notwithstanding
their unkmdness to us Not only does our
honor call in the piesent case,but it is so " nom-
inated in the bond, 'and dieadful as its effects
may be upon my countiy, yet you shall cutfiom
