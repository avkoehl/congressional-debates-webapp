i his letter was written by Mr Jefferson, before it was cer
tiiiily kuown that he would be elected President of the United
Staus Alter lie was installed into office, unlike those who
call theuiseives his disciples, he acted out the principles
which he prolessed as will appear fiom the following circular,
which he caused to be issued to the officers of the Federal Go
vernment
'•The President of the United States has seen, with dissatisfac
tion officers of the General Government taking, on various oc
casions, active parts in elections of ihe pub'ic functionaries, whe-
thei ot the General oi ot the State Governments Freedom of
elections being esse mal to the mutual independence of Govern
ments, and of the different branches of the same Government, so
viuuh cherished by the mo=t of our constituents, it is deemed
improper loi officers depending on the Executive of the Union
to attempt to control or influence the free exercise ot the elective
right This I am instructed, therefore, to njtify to all officers
within my Department, holdin  their appointments under the
authority ol the President directly, and to desire them to notny
to all subordinate to them The right ol any officer to give his
vote at elections as a qualified citizen, is not meant to here-
strained, nor, however given, shall it have any effect to his pre-
judice but it is expected that he will not attempt to influence the
votes of others, nor take any part in the business of electioneer
ing,that beine deemed inconsistent with the spirit of the Consti-
tution, and his duties to it *'
Mr Speaker, it will be seen bv the circular from which 1 have
read that Mr Jefferson required the officers of the Government
who held tneir appointments under the authority of the Presi
dent, ' not to take any part in the business of electioneering, nor
attempt to influence the votes of others—that being deemed in
consistent with the spirit of the Constuuti n, and their duties to
it " But now an attempt "o prevent, by legislative enactment,
those abuses which Mr Jefferson declaiedtobe 'inconsistent
with the spirit ot the Constitution," is denounced asa flagrant
violation ot that instrument, and is declsied to be a measure as
odious as the sedition law, 1 the officers of Government,
amounting in number to ntarly o le hundred th"usand, are re-
quired to contribute regular y a portion of theirsalanes for elec
tioneering purposes, a"d are taught to know that they cannot
render a more acceptable service to the President than by taking
an active ' part in the business ol electioneering," and by sue
cessful exertions ' to control the votes ot others " With what
propriety sir, can those win practise and tolerate abuses so
corrupting m their tendencies, claim to be the disciples of Jef
ferson and den mnce their political opponents as ' apostates
and Federalists!" But, sir, I forbear to comment upon such
g ar ng inconsistency, and will proceed to draw, from a moie re
cent < en id oi our history, facts to sustain the positions which I
have assumed My colleague, no doubt, remembers well the
famous report made by a select committee of the senate during
the hrstsession ol the nineteenth Congress, to which was refer
Teda proposition lo inquire into the expediency ot leducing the
patronage of the Exe~ut ve Government of the United States
Thatcomi nttee was composed of the leading men of the JacK
eon Democratic party ol that period Mr Benton was its chair-
man audMr Van Buren and Judge White were m mbersofit
That committee, after examining caiefully into the degree and
a mount of patronage "then exerci edby tne Piesident," arrived
a the conclus'on that it "might and ought to be diminished by
law,' and for that purpose the committee reported six bills, and
proceeded to urge reasons lor their adoption, as follows
' The committee do not doubt but that there are other
brarchesof Executive patronage, in addition to those which
are comprehended in the provisions of these bills, which may
be advantageously regulated by law Far Irom thinking that
fiey have exhausted the subject, they believe that they have
only opened it, and that nothing moie can be done at this time
than to lay the foundation of a system, to be followed up and
completed hereafter In coming to the conclusion thatExecu
tive patronage ought to be diminished and reg lated on the
plan proposed, the committee rest their opinion on the ground
that the exercise of ?reat power in the hands of one man, has
a constant tendency lo sudy Ihe purity of uur institutions, and
to endanger the liberties of the country "
How different were the opinions entertained by that commit-
tee upon the subiect of Executive patronage Irom those ex-
pressed by my colleague in this debate1 But I will proceed
with the report Aftei descanting upon the jealousy ot power,
and of the influence of patronage, which had charectenzed our
ancesiers, and attributing to that jealousy many ot the safe
guards which the Constitution provides for the picservation of
treedom therepoit p i ceeds as follows
' Thee immittee believe that they will be acting in the spirit
of the Constitution in laboring to multiply the guards and to
strengthen he barriers against the possible abuse of power If
a community could be imagined in which the Wws should exe
cute themselves—in which the power of Government should
consist in the enactment of laws—in such a state, the machine
of Goverment would carry on its operations without jar or
Inction   Parties would be unknown, and the movements of the
political machine would but little meie disturb the passions of
men than they are distuibed by the operations ot the great
laws of the material world But this is not the case The
siene «dints from this imaginary region, where laws execute
themselves, to the theatie ol real lite, wherein they are exe
cuted by civil and military officers, by armies and navies, by
courtsol justice, by the collection and disbursementof revenue,
with all its train of salaue", jobs, and contracts, and in this
aspect ol the reality we behold the working of pationage,and
dscover the ieat>onirhy so many ¡¡land ready in any coun
try, and m ullages, to flock to the ¡standard of power,
WHERESOEVER AND BY WHOMSOEVER IT MAY  Eb RAISED "
Ihe r poit   then proceeds to poitray  the great and dance
rou6 extern ol piwei an l patronage   then wielded by the Fe
d ral KxecutiVL, and l redictsits rjpidinciease toan almost in
ca culable extent, unless Congi ess could be prevailed on to in
terposeits powei t) le-^ram that tendency in the action ot our
system of Government     \nd to exenij)lify then viewot the
subject, tho committee read from the ' Blue Book ' of the Re
public, which corre-ponds with the Red Book " ol Monarchies,
to show the greatness of Executive power and patronage, by
exhibiting the extent ct that powei and influence in a single
branch of the public seivice,  in  the customhouse at Ntw
\ork      \t that time,  (l 2b) there were employed in that
custom liontc one hundred and seventy four officers, whose
annual salaries amounted,  m the aggregate, to the sum of
$'20l,6i)2,and the amount of revenue collected at that custom
tiouse, ¡n ihe same \eai,was $b 766 753 32    In ihe year 1839,
the number of offi eis employed in the custom house at New
York was lour hundred and ninety seven, whose annual coin
pensauon amounted, in the agertgate, to the sum of $540 b!5,
and the amount ol revenue collected at tha' custom house, in
the same  yeai,was 87656 826 77     Mark the enormous in
crease in the rumbei ol officers, and the amount of their com
pensauon ' whilst the amount of  revenue  collected at that
customhouse is less m 1839 than in 182b1   Yes, sir, those
who were so much alarmed at the extent of Executive pa
tionagp, power, and influence, can see nothing m its rapid and
unparalleled increase to excite their fears    It was then dange
rous to the public libeity, but now it is a most harmless thing
After making this exhibit, the committee proceed to comment
upon it as follows
"A formidable list indeed ' formidable in numbers, and still
more so from the vast amount of money in then hands The
action of sucha body of men, supposing them to be animated
by one spine must be trcnendous in an election, and that they
will be so animated, is too plain to need demonstration Power
over a man s support is power over his will The President
has power over thesupiwrt of all these officer"", and they again
have power over debtor merchants to the amount of ten million 
of dillars per annum, and over the support of an immense
number ot individuals, profession il, mechanical and day labor-
ing, to whom they can, and will, extend or deny a valuable pri-
vate as well as public patronage, according to the part they shall
act in State as well as Federal elections Still this is only a
branch—a mere prong—of Federal patronage in ihe city of New
York The same Government has, in the same city, a branch of
the United States Bank, wielding a capital of many millions, a
large military, naval, and p >st office establishment, a judiciary,
with its appropriate officers, presses winch print the laws and
public advertisements, and a long list of contractors and job
beis "
Such, su, was the frightful pictuie of Executive power and
patronage in the year 1326, as diawn by a committee of the Se
naie ol which llr Benton was the chairman, and Mi Van Bu-
ren a member The committee then proceed to warn the Se.
nate and the countiy of the fatal consequences which were
likely to result from such an accumulation of power and pa
tionage in the hands of the President, as follows
"Every wheie, to the extreme frontier of the remotest State
or Territory, Federal patronage will be found, in degree and
torce, proportienate to the population of the place, and foiever
augmenting with the increasing p'iwer of the Government Dl
nnnution of patronage is not thought of, the state of the cus-
tom house in New York is already pregnant proof of th s Tho
power ol patronage, unless checked by the cigoi ous i^teiposi
tionof Congress must go on increasing, until Federal influ
ence, m many parts ol this Confederal y, will predominate in
ele tion<-, as comoletely as British influence j redominates in
Scotlandapd Ireland, in rot'enborough towns, and in the gieat
naval stations ot Portsmouth and Plymouth "
And again, in another part of the leport, the commutes say of
Executive patronage, that—
"Its workings will contaminate the purity of all elections, and
enable the Federal Government eventually to govern throughout
the State- , as it they weie so mary provinces of one vast em-
pue    The whole of this great power will centre in the Ptesi
¡lent     Ihe King of Ineland is the 'fountain of honor,   the
President of the Unued states is the source of pationage    He
presides over the entne system ol Federal appoimments, jobs,
andcomracts    He has power over the suppart of those who
administei the system    He makes and  unmakes them    He
chooses from the circle of his friends and supporters, and may
dismiss them, and, upon all the principles of human action, will
dismiss them, as often as they disappoint his expectations   His
spirit will animate their actions in all the elections to State and
federal offices    There may be exceptions, but the tiuth of a
geneial rule is proved by the ex option    The intended check
and control of the Senate, without new constitutional or statu
tory provis ons, will cease u operate    Patronage will pene
trate this body, subdue its capacity of resistance, chain it to the
car of power, and enable the President  to rule as easily, and
much more securely, with than without the nominal check of
the Senate     If the President was himself the officer of the peo
pie, elected by them, ayid responsible to them, there would be
less danger Horn this concentration of all power in his hand-.,
but it is the business of statesmen to act upon things as they are,
and not as they would wish them to be    We murt look forward
to the time when the public revenue will be doubled, when the
civil and military officers of the Federal Government will be
quadrupled, when its influence over individuals will be multi-
plied to an indefinite extent, when the principle of public ac
tion will be open and avow ed— the President wants my vote, and
I want his patronage—1 will vote as he wishes, and he will give
me the office I wish for    What will this be but the government
of one man? and whit is the government of one man but a mo
narrhy'!   The nature of a thing is in its substance, and the name
soon accommodates itself to the substance    Names are no
thing    The first Roman Emperor was styled Emperor of the
Republic and the last French Emperor took the same title, and
their respective countries were just as essentially monarclnca •
betore as after the assumption ot these titles "
The report Irom which I read then proceeds to expatiate at
length upon the necessity of diminishing Executive patronage,
and cencludes as follows
' In the country for which the committee act, the press, (with
some exceptions,) the post office, the armed force, and the ap
pointing power, ire in the hands of the President, and the
Piebideut himself is not in the hands of the people The
President may, and in the current of human affairs will, be
against the people and, in his hands, the arbiters of human
fate must be agains them also This will not do Theposst
bihty of it must be avoided The safety of the people 'Is the
supreme law,' and, to ensure that safety, these arbiters of hu
man late must change position, and take post on the side of the
people "
Mr speaker, the principles contained in the report from
which 1 have been leading were promulgated to the people of
the United States by the Jaekson Demoeialic party, in the year
182b, as the Hue cieed of their jwlitical faith, and the people
were taught to hope and believe that, by entrusting the powers
ol the Government to that party, they would secure the correc-
tion ol the abuses so ably set forth m that leport, and save the
tree institutions ol their country Irom the corrupting anil fatal
consequences winch they were assured would lollow, if they
laileo to elevate the i eformen, to power In short, sir, they
were made to believe that, by bestowing the confidence which
was asked at their ands, all abuses in "the administration of
Lxecunve patronage" would be reformed, that the expendi-
tures of the Government would be retrenched to a most eco-
nomical standard, and that the Federal Government, m all its
various depaitments would be so administered as to restore it
to us primitive simplicity and purity The people approved
the principles which were thus prolessed, and confided in the
promises which were thus made The people of Tennessee,
especially, were almost unanimous in thus approving and con-
fiding, and, to secure ihe triumph of principles so sound, to
accomplish reforms deemed to be so necessary, they rallied
with unexampled unanimity and enthusiasm to the support of
Andrew Jackson for the Presidency. He was elected by an
overwhelming majority, ai d, in his inaugural address, he ac-
knowledged the object which the people had in view in ele-
vating him to that high and responsible station, by saying.
"The recent demonstration of public sentiment inscribes on
the listofExecutwe duties, in characters too legible to be over-
looked, the task ot reform, which will require, particularly,
the correction of those abuses that have brought the patronage
of the Federal Government into conflict with the freedom of
elections and the counteraction of those causes which have
disturbed the rightful course of appointment, and have placed,
or continued, power In unfaithful or incompe ent hands "
Mr Speaker, these w«re the principles which brought Gen.
Jackson into the Presidential chair Ten years have elapsed,
during which time the party which professed so patriotic a de-
votion to t e maintenance ot these principles have been in pos-
session of all the powers of this great Governmont Have they
redeemed the pledges which they made to the people1) Where
is the retrenchment, the reform, which they promised! They
have violated and disregarded all the pledges which they made.
They have repudiated all the principles which they prolessed
when they sought the confidence of the people They now
practise, justify, and defend all the abuses which they pledged
themselves to correct, and denounce as Federalists and apos-
tates all those who still adhere to the principles which they hypo-
critically professed, and who insist upon carrying those princi-
ples into practical operation Surely, sir, the time has come
when public sentiment ought again "to inscribe upon the list of
Executive duties, in characters foo legible to bt overlooked, the
task of refoim, and especially the coirection of those abuses
which have brought the patronage of the Federal Govern-
vient into conflict with the freedom of elections, and the
counteraction ol those causes which have disturbed the right-
Jul course of appointment, and have placed or continued
powei m unfaithful or incompetent hands "
Does my colleague require additional evidence to establish
my position that the Whigs of Tennessee, whom he denounces
so bitterly, are cont nding for the same principles, in regard to
Executive patronage, which have ever been professed by the
true Republican party, and which were professed by the leaders
of that party to which he belongs, when they were seeking
power) II he does I lurnish it to him in the followlog ex
tracts from the speeches and circulars of a man whom my col-
league delights to eulogize—I mean Governor Polk, of Tenpes
see In a speech which that gentleman delivered on this Boor,
March 13, 1826, whilst the contest tor the Presidency between
General Jackson and Mr Adams was pending, he said
"lam bold to say lam of the number who are of opinion that,
if this happy Government is ever destroyed, which God forbid,
it will be by encroachments and abuse of power, and by the ai
luring and corrupting lrfiuence of Executive patronage "
And in a circular which he addressed to his constituents in
1827, he expressed his opinions in relation to the power and in-
fluence ol the Federal Executive as follows
"In relation to the extensive patronage of the Executive, my
opinion is that it is already 'too great, is increasing, and ought to
be diminished '"
"This is not a contest between men alone Great and vital
principles are involved It is a contest between power and right.
The issue is in tact joined between the people in vindication of
their rights on the one side, and the power and patronage of
public rulers on the other "
"Those who aienot for the people, and for popular rights, are
against them, and may be justly termed servile adherents ol
power, however obtained, and by whomsoever exeicised
Let my colleague contrast these sentiments and opinions witn
those advanced by him, and entertained and "««««j™ ¡¡J"16
