Numbers 234. Report of Brigadier General Robert Toombs, C. S. Army, commanding division (temporary), of the battle of Sharpsburg.

WASHINGTON, GA., October 25, 1862.

GENERAL: The day that the army, commanded by General Lee, left Leesburg and marched toward Maryland, you notified me that I was assigned to the command of a division, composed of my own brigade, General Drayton's, and Colonel G. T. Anderson's. When Major-General Longstreet's command arrived within 4 or 5 miles of Hagerstown, I was ordered to send forward one of my brigades to that point, take possession of Hagerstown, and to hold it until further orders. I asked permission to accompany this brigade, which was granted by Major-General Longstreet. I took with me, for the execution of this order, my own brigade, then under the command of Colonel Benning, of the Seventeenth Georgia Volunteers, leaving Brigadier-General Drayton's and Colonel Anderson's brigades with the main body of the army.

I then received orders to march immediately to Sharpsburg, which I did, and reached there before daylight on Monday morning. On that day I received orders from you to detail two regiments from my own brigade (the only one then with me), and to order them to Williamsport for the protection of the wagon-train, which left me with but two regiments only, and one of those (the Second Georgia) was very small, having less than 120 muskets present for duty. With these two regiments I was ordered by you to occupy the most eligible position I could find on the Antietam River, near the bridge on the road to Harper's Ferry, in order to prevent the enemy from crossing the river. From this position I was ordered to fall back when it should become necessary, by my right flank, and to hold a hill about 400 yards below the bridge and immediately on the river, as long as it might be practicable, and then to fall back and take position on your right in line of battle, with four other brigades of your command, about 600 or 800 yards in rear of the bridge. With these orders I took possession of
