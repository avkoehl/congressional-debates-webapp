The State troops of South Carolina referred to by you go out of service six months from the date of muster. Reference must therefore be had to the company muster-rolls to ascertain that fact.

CHARLESTON, January 30, 1864.

General S. COOPER:

Telegram does not enable me to decide matter of discharge of State troops. Governor Bonham claims, in letter of Secretary of War, dated June 6, 1863, term of service began August 1; troops on that make urgent claim they were fully organized on July 31, but were not called out by these headquarters to take the field, until about September 1; mean time remained at home. Question is, shall they be discharged six months from August 1, or from date each regiment quit home, or my question [be] left to discretion [of] these headquarters to decide? There is much excitement about it.

THOS. JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
