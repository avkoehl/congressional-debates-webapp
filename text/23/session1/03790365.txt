THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
865
the Constitution has intrusted to the superintend
ence oí the President. He is an executive officer,
and Congress cannot make lum any thing else
This requires no illustration Gent'emen may
talk till doomsday, but they nevei can argue us
out of reason and common t>ense But I must do
them the justice to say, that this has been the most
desperate contest between the subtilties of lawyers
and common sense that ever I had the good or bad
fortune to witness
Now, sir, as to this union of the puise and
sword, of which we have heaid so much What
la a union of the purse and the sword ' When the
same branch of the Government has the right of
raising armies and of raising money to support
those armies Has the President claimed thei ight
of enlisting a single soldier, or of raising a single
dollar of money byway of taxation, but under tne
sanction of the laws of Congress'
Mr Speaker, the gentlemen on the other side
w.U, in their cool moments, be ready to acknowl-
edge anothei thing—that the Secietary of the
Treasuiy had a light to remove the public depos-
ites from the Bank of the United States for good
and sufficient reasons, and that he has a right to
judge in the fii st instance of the sufficiency oí those
reasons Well, sir, if this be true, it was all I
wanted to direct mem the vote I was about to give
Por if the Piesident has assumed no unconstitu-
tional powers in this tiansaction, if the Secretary
of the Tieasuiyhad a legal right to remove the
deposites, then I thought the question of then res-
toration was merely a question of expediency on
the part of Congress Fo>% granting, by way of
argument, that the removal was inexpedient, ii did
not follow that the restoration ought to take place
If the President or the Secretary had committed a
foolish act, it did pot therefote follow that Con-
gress ought to commit another folly Let us sup-
pose for a moment that the deposites had been
lemoved for a notoriously insufficient reason, but
that after the removal, and before the restoration,
a sudden calamity had befallen the bank, by which
it had become an unsafe place of deposite for the
public money Would Congress be bound to re-
stóle the deposites under such circumstances '
Certainly not It might censure the Secretary, it
might give the bank damages foi the injury done
it, butit would not thiow away the public money
by placing it in an insolvent insii'ution Theqo.es-
tion of a restoiation was, then, as I thought, a dis-
tinct one from that of the lemoval And if the
bank was not to be rechaitered, I thought the de-
posites ought not lo be íestored For, under such I
circums'anues, a restoration could be of no benefit
to the bank, and would tend to increaserathci than ,
relieve the distresses of the country Why, sir,
I was willing to take the story of the bank itself
upon this question What did the bank and the
advocates of the bank teh us*' That, unless the
bank was to be lechartered, it must go on from
day to day, from week to week, and from month
to month, curtailing its business and contracting us
discounts, in order to be able to wind up its affairs
at the end of its charter Well, su, what, under
suchcircumstances, would have been the effect of
a restoration of the deposites' Would it have en-
abled the bank to enlarge its business by extending
its discounts ' Certainly rot, sir, if what the bank
told us was true, that it roust continue to contract
us discounts, if it was not to be rechaitered, unless,
indeed, it has the very singular faculty of enlaig-
mg and contracting its discounts at the same
time
What, then, would have been the effect of a res-
toration' It would have been simply taking the de-
posites away from banks where they can be dis
counted upon, and where they aie, to a certain
extent at least, discounted upon, and putting them
back into an institution wheie they could not be
discounted upon, but where they would be locked
up in its vaults, and withdiawn fiom the use of
the commercial community How, then, could a
restoration of the deposites, if the bank was not to
be rechartered, have tended to relieve the distress
of the country' Shall we be told that it would
have effected this object by restoring public confi-
dence ' Public confidence is a plant of a very deli-
cate nature, and sometimes of a very slow growth
Gentlemen have been very successful in destroying
it Whether they can make it revive and germi-
nate again at pleasure, lemams to be proved.    A I
restoration of the deposites could only tend to
restore public confidence, in so far as it would
be a measure of lelief to ihe community, and that
it could pioduce no such relief I have already
shown
Again, if the d eposites were to be restored with-
out a recharter of the bank, they would have to be
removed again at the end of the charter, and thus
the countiy would suffer under the pressure of a
double removal
It seemed to me, sir, that the discussion upon
this question was one of a very extraordinary char-
acter We weie told that the whole countiy was
upon the verge of bankiuptcy and rum, that dark-
ness and gloom had settled down upon our present
prospects, and that a still heavier cloud of disaster
and dismay was hanging over the horizon of our
future hopes We were told that the country had
been plunged at once from tne heights of prospenty
into the lowest depths of wo, that our merchants
are broken, that our commerce is ruined .that oui
manufactuies aie abandoned, that the arts are
paralyzed, that labor is without its reward, that
industry has become no better than idleness, and
that all about us is one wide spreading scene of
deso'ation and rum Nay, more, sir, we were
told that the worst of the evils have not yet hap-
pened , that the portentous signs of a revolution
aie shaking their horrid tresses in the sky, that
the elements are becoming convulsed, that the
earth is quaking undei our feet, and that, ere long,
the fires of the volcano will buist forth, carry-
ms, in their awful nam, destruction and death
An 1 what, sir, have we been told is the cause of
all these calamities' Is uthat Heaven, provoked
at our ingratitude, and wearied out with our ob-
stinacy and crimes, is withholding its blessed in-
fluences from us ' Are the fountains of the wateis
dried up, and heve the fruits of the earth been
blasted and shrivelled under the burning influence
of the sun' Has pestilence walked abroad through
our land, and changed the countenance of health
into palei ess ' Noi,sn No disease is destioy ng
the health, no famn e is consuming the lives of our
citizers The spring again returns to us in its
loveliness, and the earth is reviving in beauty
Has, then, a foieign foe invaded oui sril Have
tre minions of despotism come fr>m beyond the
Atlantic to lavage our fields, to bum out cities, to
s'aughter oui countrymen, and to trampl  our
liberties and Constitution in tne dust' No, sn
No foreign foe has invaded our soil, and thesound
of the trumpet is not heaid in our land Is it,
then, civil- dissensions and internal commotions
that have jiroduced all these evils,' Sir, the very
fear of them had long since passed away What
is it, then, what is it, 'hat thus, as it were in a
moment, m the twinkling of an eye, has plunged
us at once into this gulf of wo' It is, say the ad-
vocates of the bank, it is the act of one bold, bad
man It is he, who, with more than the cruelty
of a despot, and the power of a monarch, has
changed this scene of happiness into one of mis-
ery
And what remedy has been proposed for all this
evil > Hwis the vio'ated Constitution to be vin-
dicated' Hnware the insulted laws to be avenged '
How are our Itbeities to beiescued from thegrasp
of this remorseless usurper' By restoring the
public deposites to the Bai k of the United States
Good heavens. Mr. Speaker, is this high sounding
prologue to a tragedv , thus to be followed by the
contemptible scenes ot a farce' Is it thus that the
violated Constitution is to Le vindicated ' When
the barnerb of the law aie broken down, and the
usurper is udmg n tuumph ovei the field, are we
to sit here deliberating and coolly resolving that
these things ought not so to be' When thefoun
dations of the Republic are shaking, and the Con-
stitution trembling under our feet, shall we cling
hold of the Doric pillars of the bank, and hide our-
selves m its vaults for safety' It gentlemen really
believed what they said, why did they not pio-
pose some meas i'e worthy of themselves and the
country ' Was there not one among them all, sir,
who dared devote himself to his country, and, like
the Roman of old,jump m*o this yawning chasm,
to propitiate her angiy duties' Shall I be told
that the President has a devoted majority m this
House, who will sanction all his measmes' Has,
then, the patr.otismof the gentlemen come to this,
that they  will not propose a meaeuie, which,
according to their own principles, ought to be
piopobed and carried through this House, simply
because they doubt its success' I will give the
gentlemen more credit for their patriotism If
they really believed the Constitution had been
violated, and that our liberties had been taken
from us, they would not have stopped to calculate
the consequences, to reckon the probabilities of
success, they would have rallied around the stand-
ard of our liberties and the Constitution, with a
determination to rescue them from the grasp of
the usurper, or perish in the attempt
It seems to me, sir, that the comae pursued by
the opposition, on this momentous question, has
been a very disastious one for the country; and I
do not believe it will turn out to be a very fortu-
nate one for themselves If one half of what we
have been told, both in and out of Congress, be
tiue, no measure has been proposed at all ade-
quate to the occasion If the Constitution has been
violated, and our liberties lnvaled, then the first
measure ought to have been the punishment of
the usurper But gentlemen have not chosen to
occupy that ground Thev have abandoned the
high and honorable course which, according to
their own principles was open to them, and have
descended to fight the battles of the bank, instead
of the Constitution Well, sir, if the removal of
the deposites has been effected by a violation of
the Constitution, their restoration by a rote of
two thirds of both Houses, would show the disap-
probation of Congress of the act of the Executive,
and repair, in some measure, the injury done the
bank But would that be sufficient' If the Con-
stitution has been violated, if our liberties have
been taken from us by the high handed measures
of a usurper, is it enough merely to show our dis-
approbation of his acts, bat to leave him in posses-
sion of an office which he has abused, and which,
if he be as bad as they represent him, he will abuse
again ' Well, sir, having abandoned that ground^
the gentlemen have proposed a restoration of the
deposites The restoration of tne deposites has
been the great end, and they have urged the viola-
tion of the Constitution as the means to accom-
plish that end The bank has been the first con-
sideration with the gentlemen, to which the Con-
stitution is but secondary and subservient They
have not attempted to impeach the President, and
why' Because, 1 suppose, they will tell u3 there
is a majority in this House who will support him
in his measures What, then, have they done'
Why, they have tried to gets restoration of the
deposites, and to relieve the distresses of the com-
munity And how have they attempted to effect
these two objects' They have tried to effect a
restoration of the deposites by irritating that very
majority upon which the restoiation must depend,
and they have attempted to relieve the distresses
of the country by telling the nation that it is utter-
ly ruined They have abused the President to
conciliate his party, they have manufactured
panics to lestore pub'ic confidence Do they sup-
pose the nation to be so blind as not to see through
all this,' Do they think to hide their designs by
so thin a disguise' it is nothing but the old story
of the ins and the outs They have dragged forth
the old fashioned, lumbering stage coach of the
opposition, newly gilded and varnished up, they
have pam'ed the bank arms upon its panels, they
have mounted the bark coachman upon the box;
and they have placed the bank fooiman, in livery,
behind And they are driving on, sir, at a very
merry rate, amid the huzzas of the town All this
will do admirably well, as long as they are going
over smooth pavements and macadamized streets
But when they have once fairly got out of sight of
the exchange, when they have passed the bounds
of the city, and left the subuibs behind, when they
have come out into the rough, uneven roads of the
country, give me leave to tell the gentlemen pas-
sengers that their good for-nothmg, crazy old
vehicle, will break down, and leave them flounder-
ing m the mud Nothing but the people's line will
run there
The memorial which I have the honor to pre-
sent to the House is signed by about 4,600 inhabi-
tants, principally legal voters in my district They
state that the commercial and manufacturing por-
tions of the district aie suffering under great pecu-
niary embarrassments, which trey attribute to the
hostility of the Executive to the Bank of the 0mted
