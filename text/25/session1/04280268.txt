These accumulations in the banks of the South and the West
are the more unaccountable inasmuch as on the 4th of July,
1838 an act of Oongiess supplemental y to the depo ne act Wd"
passed expie*5sly authorizing the Secietaiy of the lYea ury to
make transfer^ from the banks in one State to the banks m ano

That the transfeis might h ive been made with perfect ease,
and the balances in the southern and western b-^nks ledueed,

take to prove
It will be tecollected that the deposites of the public moneys
were removed from the Bank of the United States towaids the
close of'heyeai 1833 It will also be remembered that this was
precisely the time of the extinction of the national debt Until
that time theie could be no considerable accumulation of public
