strong line of works and a considerable force. Colonel Kerwin learned that Hampton's Legion and part of Hill's corps had passed down the Boydton plank in the direction of Dinwiddie Court-House. I have sent a prisoner from Sixteenth North Carolina Cavalry to you. The division is bivouacking on the high ground near the Cummings house. One brigade holds the fords. My headquarters are at that house.

Very respectfully,

N. A. MILES,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

General MEADE:

The mail-carrier has arrived. I have sent him, with two other prisoners to your headquarters. I sent the mail half an hour ago. The mail-carrier belongs to the Sixteenth North Carolina Battalion, Dearing's brigade. He says they moved down to Stony Creek Station day before yesterday; that he was left in small camp, and Dearing's brigade and all the cavalry moved along the railroad in the direction of Weldon; that he heard yesterday afternoon that Hill's corps had passed through Dinwiddie Court-House yesterday morning, moving against our troops that were on the Weldon railroad; that some wounded men were brought in yesterday afternoon, saying that there had been some fighting, in which the enemy had the worst of it; this is all I could get out of him and all I think he knows. I could get nothing specific from him as to what divisions of Hill's corps had moved. The other deserters knew nothing of any special import.

General WILLIAMS:

I understand that a move of this command was to be executed to-morrow. I have received no information on the subject officially. What about it?

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
