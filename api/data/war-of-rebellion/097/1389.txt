RED HOUSE, April 8, 1865.

The PRESIDENT:

Evacuation of Richmond completed in order on the morning of the 3rd. General Lee concentrated pretty well about Amelia Court-House on the 5th, but enemy occupied Junction that evening, and our forces moved during the night and morning of the 6th to Rice's Station. During the morning we captured some 800 prisoners, but in afternoon met a serious reverse, and portion of the army forced across the Appomattox at High Bridge and other points.

I left General Lee at Farmville yesterday morning, where he was passing the main body across the river for temporary relief. He will still try to move around toward North Carolina. There was very little firing yesterday, and I hear none to-day. No definite information as to movements of enemy from Junction toward Danville. Stoneman's advance reported yesterday to be near Liberty. Lomax reports enemy in considerable force advancing up Shenandoah Valley. No new from Echols, but he is supposed to be close on Stoneman's rear. General Lee has sent orders to Lomax to unite with Echols against Stoneman, and to Colston to make firm defense at Lynchburg.

The straggling has been great, and the situation is not favorable. Generals Gilmer, Lawton, and St. John are with me. We will join you as soon as possible.

J. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Secretary of War.
