Colonel GEORGE CROOK,

Commanding Third Brigade, Lewisburg:

Your report of your victory over Heth is received. I congratulate and thank you and your command for your brilliant conduct, and shall immediately transmit the intelligence to department headquarters. I shall urge forward transportation to enable you to move in co-operation with this line. Keep me fully informed of all passing near you. Your retaliation upon the citizens who fired on your wounded will be approved.

HDQRS. ARMY IN THE FIELD, MOUNTAIN DEPARTMENT,Franklin, May 24, 1862.

The general commanding congratulates the army on a new victory in the department, won by the skill and bravery of our soldiers against the superior number of the enemy.

The Third Brigade of General Cox's division, commanded by Colonel Crook, was attacked yesterday morning at Lewisburg by General Heth with 3,000 men, and after a lively engagement the enemy were routed and fled in confusion.

Colonel Crook captured cannon, 200 stand of arms, and 100 prisoners. Our loss was 10 killed and 40 wounded.

The results of this victory will be important. The general commanding is confident that the forces now under his immediate command but lack the opportunity to emulate the gallantry and share the glory of their comrades of the Army of the Kanawha.

This circular will be read at the head of every regiment or separate corps in this command.

By order of Major-General Fremont:

ALBERT TRACY,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
