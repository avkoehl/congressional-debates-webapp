General BRAYMAN,

Commanding at Cairo:

What is the date of the latest news you have from General Banks' expedition up the Red River, and what is its purport? Answer in cipher.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

CAIRO, ILL., April 18, 1864.

(Received 10.40 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

General A. J. Smith, of the Sixteenth Army Corps, was within 30 miles of Shreveport at last accounts. General Banks' expedition had not overtaken Smith. General Sherman has sent for Smith to return immediately and go up the Tennessee. I presume he is overtaken by the messenger. I will report as soon as I hear about General Banks' force.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
