APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
35th Cong....2d Sess.
Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
Senate & Ho. of Risps.'
there was no other alternative. During the pe-
riod when the Government itself, through its own
agents, undertook the task of providing for cap-
tured negroes, in Africa, the cost per head was
very much greater.
There having been no outstanding appropria-
tion applicable to this purpose, I could not ad-
vance any money on the agreement. I therefore
recommcnd that an appropriation may be made,
of the amount necessary to carry it into effect.
Other captures of a similar character may, and
probably will, be made by our naval forces; and
I earnestly recommend, that Congress may amend
the second section of the act of March 3,1819, so
as to free its construction from the ambiguity
which has so long existed, and render th*e duty
of the President plain in executing its provisions.
I recommend to your favorable regard the local
interests of the District of Columbia. As the res-
idence of Congress and the Executive Depart-
ments of the Government, wc cannot fail to feel
a deep concern in its welfare. This is heightened
by the high character and the peaceful and orderly
conduct of its resident inhabitants.
I cannot conclude without performing the agree-
able duty of expressing my gratification that Con-
gress so kindly responded to the recommendation
of my last annual message, by affording me suffi-
cient lime before the close of their late session
for the examination of all the bills presented to
me for approval. This change'in the practice of
Congress has proved to be a wholesome reform.
It exerted a beneficial influence on tiie transaction
of legislative business, and elicited the general
approbation of the country. It enabled Congress
to adjourn with that dignity and deliberation so
becoming to the representatives of this great Re-
public, without havjrfg crowded into general ap-
propriation bills provisions foreign to their nature
and of doubtful constitutionality and expediency.
Let me warmly and strongly commend this pre-
cedent, established by themselves, as a guide to
their proceedings during the present session.

To this estimated deficiency on the 30th June, !
I860, should bo added the sum of $3,838,728, :
which will be required for the service of the Post'
Office Deparlment during the present fiscal year.
This latter amount is not taken into the foiegomg
estimates, but is asked for by that Department, :
as will appear from the letter of the Postmaster 1
General accompanying the annual estimates. ,
When my last annual report was submitted to !
Congress, I explained the'em^rrassments tinde'f
which the estimated receipts into the -Treasmfy
were made. A new tariff act had just gone iftfo
operation, under circumstancesgrowing'outdftBie
then recent revulsion in trade and basiftess^HyRicli
made all calculation as to Its effect upon iHe fev-
j enue doubtful and unsatisfactory. This 'opimdn
i was frankly expressed to Congress.at tfere time.
| The present estimates are submitted undersome-
1 what more favorable circumstances, and conse-
; quently with greater Confidence in their correct-
ness.
The tariff of 1857 has been in operation more
than a year, and in ordinary times the experi-
ence of that year would afford reliable data to
judge of its effect as \yell upon the trade of the
country as the revenues of the Government. The
continuance of financial difficulties during a large
portion of the time, however, and the effects of
it, operating to a great extent during the whole
period, create serious difficulties in forming a
satisfactory judgment upon the question. The
present estimates are based upon the opinion that
a reaction in the trade and businesst)f the coun-
try has commenced, and that we are gradually,
but steadily, returning to a healthy ana prosper-
ous condition. There seems to be a concurrence
in the public mind on this subject, if we may
judge from the genVral tone of public sentiment.
The files of the Department furnish strong evi-
dence of its truth. Our exports forthe year end-
ing the 3(>th'of June, 1858, were $324,644,431—
being a reduction from the preceding year of
only $38,316,261; whilst the imports for the same
tunc were $28'2,613>150—being $78,276,991 less
than the ye or before. This balance in favor of
exports over imports was doubtless appropriated
to the payment of our foreign debt, thus reliev-
ing the country, in part, of that source of em-
barrassment. It exhibits a large margin for an
increase of importations when the business and
necessities of the country shall demand it. The
. restoration of confidence and reaction of trade
■ have already been manifested in this regard.
fty referring to the receipts from customs at the
port of New York, for the months of October
and November, 1856, the year preceding the re-
, vulsion, the same months of 1S57. the year of
revulsion, and the same months of the present
year, I find that the receipts of those two months
in 1856, were$6,202,227: in J857, were$2,028",210;
and in 1858, were #3,830,819. Whilst the coun-
try has not recovered entirely from'the disasters
of tiie last year, the increased receipts of the
present year indicate a decided reaction, and the
promise of a certain and speedy return of pros-
perous tunes.
The foregoing estimates contemplate a defi-
ciency in the means of the Government which,
by the 30th June, 1860, will amount to the sum of
#7,914,576. Provision should be made by Con-
gress, at its present session, to supply the defi-
ciency. In what manner shall ltbe done ? A loan
for this purpose is not deemed advisable, in view
of the addition already mndc to the public debt.
A revision of the tariff of 1857, and the imposition
of additional duties, is the only leniedy, unless
Congress shall take some action to relievo the
Treasury from a portion of the expenditures it is
now required to meat.
In revising the tariff, the same principles should
direct and control the action of Congress^that
would be considered m the adoption of an original
act.
j do not deem it proper to enter into any ex-
tended discussion of the theoretic principles on
which a tariff act should be fiamed.
They may he briefly stated. Sue!) duties should
be laid os will produce the required revenue by
imposing on the people at large the smallest and
the most equal burdens.
It is obvious that this is most effectually done
by taxing, in pieference to others, such articles
as are not produced in this country; and, among
articles produced here, those in which the home
product bears the least proportion to the quantity
imported are the fittest for taxation. The reason
is that, in taxing articles not made in the country,
the whole sum taken from the consumer goes into
the Treasury, while, in the other class, the con-
sumer pays the enhanced value not only on the
quantity imported, but on the quantity made at
