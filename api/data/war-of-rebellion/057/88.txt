treated in wild confusion. We followed the enemy about 1 mile, when, in wild confusion. We followed the enemy about 1 mile, when, night coming on, we were ordered back to camp.

I cannot speak too highly of the bravery displayed by Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, of the Second Michigan Cavalry, and Major E. G. Savage, of the Ninth Pennsylvania Cavalry. To the first is due the honor of checking a victorious enemy with a mere handful of his regiment, and to the second of leading the charge of the Ninth Pennsylvania while driving the enemy from their strong position in the woods.

In this action the Ninth Pennsylvania Cavalry had 2 killed and 4 wounded. In the Second Michigan there was no loss, though for more than one hour they sustained their position under a hot fire of the enemy. The First East Tennessee Cavalry had a few days before been detailed upon other duty, and was not in the action.

Respectfully submitted.

Colonel, Commanding.
