GARNETT'S MOUNTAIN SIGNAL STATION, February 2, 1864.

Major-General NEWTON:

Commanding First Army Corps:

We intercepted the following message from the rebel signal station on Clark's Mountain:

Colonel Skiner wishes to be placed on a board to examine the cases of cavalry-men of Imboden's command claimed by Steuart's brigade. It is approved? Colonel S. applies for an extension of leave of absence four days. Is it approved?

PITZER,

Major, Aide-de-Camp.

Respectfully,

WIGGINS, and CAMPT,

Signal Officers.

WASHINGTON, February 2, 1864-10. 30 a. m.

Brigadier-General LOCKWOOD,

Baltimore, Md.:

As you have forwarded one battery and one goes from here, I think they will be sufficient unless others should be asked for.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

CUMBERLAND, MD., February 2, 1864-10 a. m.

(Received 11. 45 a. m.)

Brigadier-General CULLUM,

Chief of Staff, Washington:

Colonel Mulligan reports he drove back the enemy on the New Creek Valley road yesterday evening, and that he is reported falling back on the Patterson's Creek Valley road this morning. Our force is pursuing. Troops arrived from Harper's Ferry this morning. More on the way. Railroad and telegraph yet safe.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, February 2, 1864-8 a. m.

Brigadier-General SULLIVAN,

Harper's Ferry:

Your telegram received. Nothing from Mulligan this a. m. All quiet here. The enemy reported in Romney, 500 cavalry. I trust your cavalry will reach there to-night. I think you had better hold the balance of the troops at Harper's Ferry. I cannot learn the strength of the enemy. Deserters differ widely; some say 10,000, some 20,000. The force I think is large. The One hundred and twenty-third [Ohio] arrived and go to New Creek this a. m.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
