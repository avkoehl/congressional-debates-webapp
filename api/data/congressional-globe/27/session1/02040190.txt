#«33,064,449
During the remainder of the year what amount would be re
tóeivedto meet this balance of $33000,0001 That most be a
patter of supposition, but in the opinion of the Secretary there
were data to justify the anticipation of $14,670,000 take this
from the $33,U00,0Q0, and it would leave a balance or the 1st

there was another item to be added On the 1st January,

notes of $6 087,274 So that/Ae actual amount of Govern

There were some appropriations which had already been
made at the present session, and there was, beside, a bill (No
8) which hepresumed would pass, appiopriatmg two millions
A portion of this money was for the national defences, andaf
ter the insinuations which had been thrown out by some gen
tlemen, in reference to the pacific tendencies, if not the rusil
lammous course of the present Admims'iation, he hoped gen
tlemen would not refuse to vote money for putting the coun
try m an attitude to meet an enemy    Al er assuming a war
tone in that House, he took it for granted they would not lefuse
the national defences     The  bill contained, however, some
Other provisions, it provided for giving the pay of volunteers
who had died m the Florida campaigns to their widows and
children    Would gentlemen, by refusing appropriations like
this, try to make political capital at home,it the risk of the honor
of the Government and of the whole country?   tie ti usted not
Not a dollar had yet been paid to his own constituents, the
Georgia militia, who had mounted their horses and served m
six successive campaigns    Their own State, compassionating
their sufferings, had interposed, and advanced &208 000 for then
relief, and Georgia now asked that this sum might be refunded
to her    Where were the Representa ti ves from 1 ennessee, Ala
bama, and Florida1*   The bill must pass, it never could be re
fused    Add these two millions, and it made the entne sum
626,394,044
Mr D had thus arrived at the same result with the gentle
man from Kentucky, who had preceded him [Mr Davis] The
result was a matter of figures a question of arithmetic, and not
a picture oí the imagination
The gentleman from Virginia, however, the former chair
man of the Committee of Wavs and Means, (a gentleman for
Whom Mr U cherished the highest personal respect and es
teem,) had spoken of the amount of unexpended appropriations
as justly to be considered an item of credit in the Treasurer's
account Mr D would admit that it might become such, and,
therefore, he would deduct that amount fiom the giand aggre
gate he had just given statin  the sum at $12,700 000 it would
reduce the amount of debt and liabilities of the Government for
the present year to 814,3a8,184 How was this to be paid? Gen
tlemen on the opposite side said it ought to be met by a new id
sue of Treasmy notes the fuends of the Administration con
tended thatu was better to bonow the money, and let the peo
pie know how they actuallj ¡stood Mr 1) held the lattei opi
nion Let there be no deccpti  n The American people Wf re
magnanimous, and they were an honest people They disliked
concealment, they abhoired hypocrisy let the Government
ask them, and then leply would pro >ab!> be, ' What do ye u
want this money for1" 1 tie answer was ea v We want n to

and died m your beivice, anl lastly to buy munitions of wir
wherewith to defend your lives and yum piuperiy Let them
understand this and they would assent with pleasure and
alacrity to so just a demand
Mr D satd, in conclusion, that he knew it was unpleasant to
gentlemen who were fi lends of the last Administration to lu ar
it said they had left their successors heavy debts to pay, and
he freely admitted that for many ol the &\ propnations which
went to make the amount, he and his Whig mends had voted
with gentlemen on the other aKle, on i he wished now to -see
the money expended and the objects effected foi winch it had
been given
He then adverted again to the claim of Geoigia and of Mis,
soun for money advan ed by those state-, to p iy their votun
teers he had prepared an amendment to covei both íheie

half a million Ihese moneys were due ovei the whole conn

vices and then refuse to pay for them He ü usted gentlemen
would not be so illiberal as well as so unjust to the pauy in
power as to refuse the bilí now befoie the committee
Mr ATHERTON agreed with the gentleman from Georgia,
that it was the best way to deal openly ind honestly wuhihe
people, and he thought the people would be inclined to apply
this asa test to the professions of then Repiesentatives htre
When gentlemen charged the former Administiation with hav
ing brought the country in d^bt they would look to see whether
those who undeitook to show tint, by figures weie un ionn m
their calculations Cut if they found me man stating the debt
at one amount and anothet at another (june diffejent, they
would and very reasonably too begin to su pect th it theie was
some delusion in the whole ¡statement The report ot the Se
cretary u&elf, if it came out in difluí en t paits of Hto different
conclusions, was certainly such a document as led otheia who
baaed their calculations upon it to very diffeient íesults One
inferred from his statements that thp debt w is thirty oí o mil
lions, another made it sixteen millions,, ano her stated it
at twelve millions How could the people tiust such
guides?
Mr A here referred (o calculations which had been made at
the close of the last session as to the probable 1 abilities of the
present Administration, when it shoui 1 come mto power and
one gentleman from New lork [Mr BarnvrdI whose speech
hequoted, had estimated thprn at not less than foity millions
Now estimates to be credible must not only come tothesime
results, but they must agree in the items which made uuo
But the printed speech of the hononb e gentleman and there
port of the Secretary of the Treasury di 1 n^f isrree The foot
mg was nearly the same but he items m then columns were
very different 1 he Secretaiy included in hi^ e-^i nttes loui
millions to be speculated on by hr^ iers, or placed m baikst>
be discounted upon, and three millions f>r the expenses and
the appropriations of this present exti i session of Congres ,
neither ef which were in the contectuie& of the gentleman nom
New Hork, and, therefore then coming to a similar general re
suit was no proof in itself that eithei was coi re< t
Other gentlemen estimated very differently In fact, there
was nothing in which these gentlemen seemed to agree save
this that the last Administration had bequeathed to the present
an enormous load of public debt The gentleman fromGeor
gia made its amount fourteen millions, but m that he did not
agree with the Secretary, who made it but twelve millions
How could thev all be 'rue? Seeing such discrepancies, the
people would begin to doubr whether there was in reality any
debt at all Ore fact was well worthy of notice the Sccietary
nowhere in his reporttola Congress how much the public debt
actually was
Mr R referred to the speech made by Mr Evans last ses
sion, in which he had taunted and ridiculed the late Admims
tration for neglecting the wants if the country—for acting m a
miserable, niggardly spirit, and especially aimed his shafts at
the ex Secretary for recommending a vigorous system of re
duction in the public expendituie    He had been answered by
a gentleman from Virginia, (Mr-----------,) who reminded him
of the adage of l>r Franklin,' a penny saved is a penny gamed "
The gentleman might have srone higher into antiquity and
quoted from a Roman economist, who had truly declared
"Magnum est vectigal parsimonia "
It was very extraordinary that the Secretary should ask
Congress to boriow four mi lions of dollars and pay interest
upon it, that it might lie idle in the Treasury, or, what was
moreptobable be put in the hands ol brokers for purposes of
speculation, oi be deposited as a balance to trade upon with
some ' fiscal agent" Deduct these foui millions and the
amount needed would be reduced, according to the Secietary
himself, to twelve millions deduct from this again the amount
of Tieasury notesyettobe issued, and it would bring down the
sum to six mill.ons deduct from this another balance of three
millions (the Reporter could not hear for what) fand it would
reduce it to thiee millions, from this deduct one million of
Treasury notes out and that would not be presented within the
year, and it would diminish it to two millions Then the Se
cretary had acknowledged an error oi half a million, m his
communication to the Senate, and there was anothei half mil
lion in Treasury notes which had been charged twice these
made a million take this from the two millions, and the for
midable amount of deficit to be provided for shrank to owe
million And if the expenditures of the Government were not
to increase, there would be no deficit at all, and therefore,
there had been no need whatever for calling the present extra
session of Congress A gentleman from Kentucky (Mi ---------)
had said, at the very opening of the session, that if this Con
gress was not going to chai ter a Bank, he was ready at once to
go home It was not to meet any exigencies of the Tiea
sury thattív3 session had actually been called, however con
venient an excuse such an alleged necessity might furnish
the nation
Mi A here went into a calculation to show what annual
imouU of expenditure would be incurred at the tare asked for
by the ¡Secretary and came to the conclusion that, as he wanted
eleven millions, to be expended m three months, it was at an
annual rite of expenditure of no less than forty four millions
The chaumanof the Committee of Way& ind Means had
said that it was certain the estimates of the Secretary woul 1 not
be too high for a test had ah eady been hum hed inthee\nen
se* of this session The Secretary ha i estimated them at but
©350 000, whereas they already amounted to &390 000, and Mr
A would be agteeably suipnsel il they did notmn up to at
least S'íOO 000 li this was a test of the accuracy of the Secre
tary s euimues he did not think the result very giitifymg
Theie was one thing to be considered however in palliation of
this wide departure from exactness it might be desirable to
impiess the countiy with an idea that an extra session would
not be attended with any veiy gieat expense
Rethought the wai estnn ite m theiepoit entnelv too large,
the money would not be expended withmthe pies<mt yeir \
Secretaiy of the Treasury, however, eouldcieite a deiiut at
anytime he pleased and to whatevei amount he had only to
dtoositehis money in the han Is of disbursing agents The pie
sent *"secu tary of Wat understood that sou of thing veiy per
fectlv six e he had been engascd m investigations with a view
to fix the practice on the last Administiation He adveited to
the complaint that works of internal imriovement had been
stopped and theimplements sold, andjustifud tlialprccedjre
on the giound that Congiess ha 11 lonoume 1 the conducting of
such woiksby the General Government tobe unconstitutional
As to its being beneath the dig nty ol the Government to be
coming fiom scssi m to session to Co gres isking fn theb
berty to issue Treasury notes, it was the people who were the
masters of the Government, and not the Government of the
people It wa& not economical doctrine to hold that the Go
vernment must be kept largely in funds When it had plenty
of money it would be lavish in its expenditui e, foi it was a po
litical Uuth m JI countnes that a rich Government and a poor
people went usually togethci If the means of the Treasury
were short, it would take care to husband its means The best
place for the nation s money was the pockets of the people
He viewed the proposition in the bill as connected v*ith othej
measures which were intended to accompany it and a r radical
statesman would not confine his view to this as an isolated
measure, but would look at the sin rounding circumstances It
was connected with the land bill and W3s, in ¡act, & propos tion
to b >rrow money to distribute if among the States it would go,
not to the people from whose labor it came but to Legisla mes
and co> poiations or to laise thestoeks of the State m niaiket,
or else for works of internal impiovement oi a [ariia' loci)
and circtim en bed chaiacter Then it was ai=o connected
with a bill to tax notmeielythe luxim^sof the rich, but the
necessaries of the poor—tea sugai molasse" anl salt He in
veisrhed against the paymei t oí heavy taxes by one class of
people for th* actu il bfnefit of anothe class Gentlemen call
ed tins protection, but that was only adding i isult to iniuiy
In referente to the lemai lis made by Mr Sergeant a few days
since Mr A insisted that inequality in taxation was a sound
and \alidargument in favor of economy and lor keeping the
Government within the limits of the Constitution He strenu
ou<=ly denied that such arguments tended to disunion or evince!
any want of affection for the Constitution but the contrary It
was the c iv  ilidators who were thp tiue nulbfiers ¡v i A
warm'y insiste 1 that the present bill was in effect a bill to as
sume the debts of'he States which had been openly advocated
on the ground that it would relieve the totales trom their em
barrassnert But how could ltd > this, unle sby discharging
their deb si And what was trie difference whethei the General
Gove nment enabled the States to do this, or the Government
did it for the State*? He referred to a certain ominous corre
spondence between European bankers and the President of the
United States
I     Perhaps those gentlemen had this very distribution bill in
view    Mr A also quoted the letter of Mr  Williams to the
Secretary of the Treasury
[Mr Fillmore asked him to read Mr Ewmg's reply ]
1 he reply was read
Mr A nextr^adMr Webster's reply to the President, m re-
lation to the letter of the Butish bankers, stating that such let
ters required no reply, and that none had been given j hia
Mr A considered as a great dereliction from duty, and insisted
that Mr Webster ought to have replied and enlightened these
gentlemen by letting them know that the General Government
had no control ovei the States, and could not compel them to
pay their deb s
[Some explanations here passed between Mr A and Mr Bar
nard, to whose speech the former had referred ]
Mr A said that if the Rothschilds should take one hundred
thousand dollars of this loan, and happen to hold the bond of
one of the States for a hundred thousand dollars, if that State
should get a hundred thousand dollars m the distribution o! the
lands, and should give it to Rothschilds to take up us bond,
would not this be an .assumption of State debts? The mode
might be covert an i insidious, but that would be the result
Mr A insisted, in conclusion, that the loan was wholly unne
cessary, and only went to create a large national debt He
would not accuse gentlemen of wishing lor such a debt, but if
he was m favor of a high tauff, and a splendid system of inter
nal improvements, and for enriching the few at the expense of
the many—if he desired to make the nch richer, and the poor
pooler, and by taxing equally poor and rich to benefit the rich
and weaken the poor, then would he be in favor of creating a
national debt, as an entering wedge to such a system
Mr PRO!1 FIT now obtained the floor, when
Mr niLMORE, Chan man of the Committee of Waysand
Means, who had introduced the bill, stated that he had an
amendment to offer, and, as there lacked but about half an
hour to two o'clock when the bill must be taken out of Com
mittee, he entreated Mr P to yield him the floor, for the pur
poseol moving it
Mr PROFFIT, after complaining of his hard fate, and his
earnest desire to speak upon the bill, said he would not refuse
such a request, and yielded the floor
It was claimed by Mr GAVE JOHNSON, but the Chair, af
tei a discussion on order an appeal from Mi Johnson, and the
withdrawal of the appeal, ga^e the floor to
Mr FILLMORE, who ollered some amendments in modifica
tion ofthe bill
Mr F declined any attempt at reply to the numerous speech
es mado on the other side, and went on to state that the amend
mentshadnow been offered with the approbation of the Com
mittee of Ways and Means  That committee had differed some
what m opinion fiom the fiist, as to the form ofthe bill—many
of the membcis desiring that the loan should not extend beyond
the political life of the piesent Administration, during at least
oneJSPresidential term, so that the present Administiation might
while in power, discharge all the debt bequeathed from the^
last    And Mr F had been of opinion that the bill, even in its
present form, would practically effect that object    Some gen
tlemen, however, preferred that it should so appear  on the
face ofthe bill ltsell, and it had now been modified accordingly
As, however, the leduction of the dutation oí the  loan would
íeqtitre a higher rate of interest, it had been fixed at six instead
of five pel cent    Ihi-. he consulted as a very tuning matter,
in companion withdischaiging the debt, ->nd, besides, sis per
cent was no moie than the Government was nowpaying on
Tieasury notes
Mi T could not now go into a general discussion He only
desired the committee to uke a common sense view of the
subject The voice of the gentleman from Virginia [Mr
IojnesJ had often been heard m that hall, appealing to the Re
presentatives of the people to provide ways and means for the
Tieasury, beyond the oidmaiy revenues of the Government,
and seldom had it pleaded in vain Why this suddenchange*
Why did those Repiesentatives now hear, from the same high
ly íespectable quaiter that all such additional ways and means
weie utterly unnecessary1* What change had taken place in
the country within one short vear7 When there had been a
deficit before, it must immediately be provided for There
was a deficit now, but how differently did the same gentleman
aiguci
Mr t then next idverted to the gi eat falling off in the reve-
nue under the opfraüon t f the compromise act From ovei
six millions they had fallen down to three million one hundred
and fifty eight thousand only four tenths of which fell in be
fore the Utt f July He stated the total reduction on the cus
toms to amount to seven millions and a half The previous
Administration had used up all the current revenue besides
seven millions extra, which had been m store when they came
into power They had thus used up fourteen millions extra,
and still left the Government m debt By what sort of magic
did they suppose the Government was still to meet all de
mandsaftei such a reduction^ Then, besides there were three
millions and a h°If taken off by the land bill for distribution
With a diminution, then, of from sixteen to eighteen millions,
gentlemen still expected to make the country believe that the
meansof the Seeietary of the Treasury were ample and abun
dant A great confusion of ideas seemed to prevail as to the
terms appropriation and indebtedness There might be appro
pnation without indebtedness, and theie might be indebtedness
without appropriation Supposing Congress should appropri
ate a large sum for works not to be begun till some future time,
during that interval there would be an appropnation, but not
strictly a debt On the othei hand, a wnrk might be v^iy
necessaiv, and the Government under actual obligation
to perform it and yet no appropriation made for it
There would be a debt, but no apptoL nation There
was now a large amount of actual debt to be ap
propnated for There was no time now to go into a
detailed examination of ihe iepoit Gentlemen had tried to
makesorrpthmgojt of alleged discrepancies between the state
ments of the Pieaidertand those of the Secietaiy But these
differences could be readily explained The President m his
s atements had rejected all fractions below thousands and when
a number of items thus cui tailed came to be added up there might
be a consi ¿ei ab e diffei ence Besides this, there was a mistakem
the last paragraph of theme>ssaee,iu one ofthe items of a column
of figures it was a cletical mistake The clerk had corrected
it in the item itself but had forgotten aftei wards to make a cor
responding coriecüon in the looting of the column Although
the gen leman from Virginia had charged the report with beine
calculate 1 to deceive, what proof had had he brought of such
position1* Why, foisooth, that the President had estimated the
¡    means of the Tieasury at fourteen millions, while the Secre
