A board or commission charged to awarda just compensation to loyal owners in the State of Maryland whose slaves enlisted in the military service of the United States has been in session at Baltimore, Md., since December, 1863. The whole number of claims presented to October 4, 1864, is 1,015, five of these being for men drafted.

Up to October 1, 1864, 244 of these claims had been passed upon by the commission; of these nine were rejected, and upon the remainder awards were made proportionate in each case to the term of service which the recruit had prior to enlistment owed to the claimant. Twenty-five of the accepted claims, amounting in the aggregate to $ 6,900, have been paid by the disbursing officer attached to this Bureau. Unpaid claims amounting to $ 47,800 are now on file in this office.

For a more detailed statement of the disbursements in connection with this Board your attention is respectfully invited to the report of the disbursing officer, Captain LeG. Benedict, assistant adjutant-general of volunteers, which is herewith.*

By the death of S. F. Streeter, esq., late president of this Board, the Government has lost a servant justly distinguished for his integrity and efficiency.

The Board recently appointed by the Secretary of War to investigate similar claims arising in the State of Delaware, has commenced its sittings. Only eight claims have yet been presented.

Brigadier General L. Thomas, Adjutant-General of U. S. Army, who has superintended and directed the organization of nearly all the new regiments raised in the slave States and States in rebellion, will, it is presumed, make a detailed report of his operations.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. W. FOSTER,

Assistant-Adjutant-General of Volunteers.
