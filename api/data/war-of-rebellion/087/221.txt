mediately after dark I withdrew my command, in accordance with orders, the Tenth Corps covering the movement, and marched my two divisions by Point of Rocks to my old camp, near Petersburg. The cavalry moved by Broadway Landing, reporting to the major-general commanding when they had crossed the Appomattox. The Tenth Corps returned to its former camp. The night was extremely inclement, and the roads were in an exceedingly bad condition, but my command arrived at camp in very good order between 6 and 7 a. m. on the 21st. The subsequent operations have already been set forth in my report of the battle of Reams' Station, August 25, 1864.*

The death of Major-General Birney has rendered it impossible for me to obtain any detailed report of the operations of his corps. Brigadier-General Terry, whose division led the assault on the 16th, was commended for his gallantry on that occasion.

The reports of Generals Mott, Barlow, and Miles are herewith inclosed. No report has been received from General Gregg, commanding cavalry. Colonel G. N. Macy, Twentieth Massachusetts Volunteers, is particularly mentioned by General Barlow for good conduct. He was severely wounded during the attack on the enemy's position on the 15th. He had only returned to his command on that morning, having been absent from wounds previously received. My staff were active in the performance of their duties during these operations.

I append a list of casualties in my own corps. I regret that I am not able to include the casualties of the Tenth Army Corps and the cavalry, having received no reports from them.

I am, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 12, 1864.

GENERAL: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this corps between the 22nd and 26th of August, including the engagement at Reams' Station on the 25th of August:

It is proper to premise that the Second Corps, with part of the Tenth Corps and General Gregg's cavalry, had been operating on the north side of the James River from the morning of the 14th instant, engaged daily in skirmishing with the enemy and on several occasions in considerable affairs, which at an earlier period of the war would have been dignified by the name of battles. General Mott's division (the Third)
