prevailing in this country of the strength of Spain
at flint time.
I desire, now, to call the attention of the Sen-
ate to a few extracts showing what was the es-
tablished policy of the Government down to the
time of the Ostend manifesto. It was not con-
fined to any one Administration. U was not con-
fined to Mr. Adams, or Mr. Clay, or Mr. For-
syth, or Mr* Webster, bat Mr. Buchanan himself
participated in it, Mr. Foisyth writes, in 1823:
"TotliiP plain rennnk. I could onlv  ep!y that, Without

Spun ; Uni he wa- no doubr awan; that there could be no
mi-undei =tcuidin2 between the two Government* on this
point without a roiemiee to Washiy^ton.5' !
This policy of our Government was summed ;
up by Mr. \Vebster, in the year 1843, in his dis- .
patch of January 14, while lie held the office of
Secietary of State. lie says:
"Tlse Spani-h Government had Ion? hern m po^f=<15=r-ioii 1
of the policy and wi-ho ol tin- Govenu.n'uf in ie aidto
Giibr*, wiueh hnve uevei been enansed, ;i:>d ha1- been re- '
peatedly told that the United Starednevei would penmt ,
the occupation or thnt Hand by IJnti^h a<renN ortmee-,
upon aiiv ptoiext whatsocv er ; and that, in the event ol any
attempt to wre-r it Horn hei,-he mi^ht ^eeuielv lelvup.ui 1
the whole naval and nnhtaiy ic-ouicch. of thi> country to
aid in pi (Serving or rceovenng it." ;
In the year 1846, on the 17th of June, Mr. 1
Buchanan wrote to Mr. launders; and at this I1
time he seems to hove imbibed somewhat of the 1
epirif, and to have copied r;<>mr-what of the man- 1
ner of those gioat masters of diplomacy who had
pieeoued him. He says: i

to the pt'^ent, eonds'ion and iutuie prospect-- o: Cuba. The ,

He then goes on to nay that v.ve can never con-
sent that she shrJI become a. colony of any Euro- ■
pean Powei : and add?:

Gjut'-d Status, upon the pajment oi a fait and lull eoiir-i'i-
eiiUion."
He then proceeds to give instructions as to the
manner in which thai negotiation shall be con-
ducted. This nohcy continued down to the year
1834, when yon will find, on examination, a sud-
den and an entire change. That was the period
of the Ostend manifesto, when three puitlcinen,
clothed in cuslomaty suit* of diplomatic black,
made their appearance ot Ostend, whence they
issued this remarkable document, and you will
tmm see an entire change m the spint nf our ne-
gotiations. If Spam had been aware of the mis-
sion of these soble-rohed diplomatists, when they
fluted from Aix-la-Chapelle, ami alighted at Os-
tend, she might have felt as the Roman shepheid
did, when the hoarse note ol the sinister raven,
from the hollow oak on the left, predicted the loss
ot his possessions. What is now the lan^ua^u
u.std lowatds Spam? I quote from the O&tend
manifesto:

The question which he says must bo answered
in the affirmative in older to justify us in wrest-
ing Cuba fiom the possession of Spain is this: ,
4' docs her possession seriously endanger our in- }!
tenia! peace and the existence of our enenshed
Union." Thnt very question they there proceed '
to answer in the affirmative in another part of the
same document. T find, in a previous part of the
sam--1 paper, this expression of opinion on the part
of its distinguished authors:
Indeed, the Union can never enjoy repose, nor po?se«s
reliable M-eunty, a* long as Cuba is not embraced within
it.- bouiidas
That answers the question which has been put
by thcs'i gentlemen, most emphatically in the
affirmative. That seems to be a decisive expres-
sion of opinion in regard to the necessity of„our
occupation of Cuba as a matter of self-preserva-
tion.
1 do not see how the question could be an-
swered moie affirmatively than Mr. Buchanan has
proceeded to answer it in this Ostend letter. Then,
in ins judgment, the time has actually come when
we shall be justified in wresting Cuba from the
possession of Spam, on the sum* pitnciple that
you would tear down the burning house of vour
neighbor to protect your own. Here, then, is an
cntne and complete change in tlie policy of this
Government m ie^ard to the management of this
negotiation. But the change is not confined to
the policy of the negotiation, but also extends to
the manner of conducting it. Up to that time,
there had been manifested the most conciliatory
spirit towards Spam*, a careful avoidance of any-
thing likely to wound her sensitue honor had
"been manifested, even by Mr. Buchanan him-
self. Look at his mstiuctiotis to Mr. Saunders,
in the first instance, to show how very carefully
everything offensive was to be avoided:

Mr. Saunders, in iep!v, mfoi tus ATt. Buchanan
how strictly lie b;td folio a ed his adv.ee on thirf
subject. []e says he made the appioaches in the
most delicate and eaivlnl maimer: that in the first
interview t!m Minister did not know that lieactu- ;
ally \wis talking of cession; tluH he snj>posed he '
was talking of guarantee, so dehcau-'v did he np-

in v h;eh the rv^ot letmn was eonditcu.d. Mr.
Mi rev was somewhat .va.";vi:;ed when he found

fnui m wn-stm^ the Mand of ('uha from fcjpsnn; ,
and he expressly :.i-'ti uci- Mi.Saule to inform
th'i Spamsh Min'isN y that our aneieot policy does ■
still conumio to exist, notwithstanding the tone ,
of tho Ostend mamiesto mi^ht l-ad him to sup- ;
pose that ir had been abandoned by our Govern- ►
ment. Now, what is the piesent mode of con- j
ducting this negotiation r I iiave shown you i
1 how it was formerly conducted, not only as to its
! ultimate policy, but, also, as to the manner of ne-
1 gotiating. The change, f think, is as great in the
j manner as in the uhimate policy. And, in the first
■ place, look at the President's message. Instead.
; of the conciliatory tone which had been previously
i held, he begins by exaggerating pending*difficul-
' ties. He informs us, m his message, that our
: relations with Spain are very unsatisfactory. He
: then goes on to state to Congress, in several por-
tions of his message, what aie thegucvaiices notv '
existing against Spain; and,rafter all, he only
■ makes out that there is a debt of about one hun-
1 dred and twenty-seven thousand dollars which
; has not been paid; and he intimates that Spain
. has a demand against us of a larger sum, includ-
; ing interest in the celebrated Aimstad case* In
the debate which took place in the upper IIouso
- of the Cortes on this subject, the Minister of For-
1 cjgn Affairs stated that he was utterly astonished
■ when he read this message, and found that the
condition of the negotiations between the two
, countries was not in a satisfactory state. Ho
said he was not aware of any cause of quarrel
whatever; that everything, as he supposed, had
been settled. He received this message with as-
tonishment. It was all new to the minister who
had the care of the matter in Spam.
Then, how is the question treated in the report
of the honorable Senator who has reported this
bill? In what manner docs he attempt to commence
thus negotnition with fcjpain? Does he follow
. oufrthat conciliatory spirit which has heretofore ^
been shown? He knows very well how to ne-
go:iato. When he holds the language he does to-
■ wards Spam, His not because he is not well aware
that it is not the way to inducc a leluctant nation
to part with a valuable possession. I beg leave
to read a few extracts from that leport, to show
Imw the nonoiable Senator from Louisiana [Mr.
Nudelt.] thinks it pioper to conduct this negoti-
ation. This i epoi t will be caiefully read in Spain.
It will be thete as soon a^ it can be conveyed, if
it is not there aheady. He says, on the 12th page
of the report:
'• But even tln'-e ai cuniont- will not be pressed upon un-
wuhmjeais, Our mun>fei wili not broach the r-uhioct until

diate nun
Now, It is perfectly evident that the honorable
Senator could not have supposed this to be a con-
ciliatory mode of conducting the negotiation. He
inf'oims Spam that she is in the condition of a
bankrupt who has parted with the largest por-
' tion of ins estate, and must now sell the remain-
der in order to save the family mansion. This
idea has been followed up here m debate. The
other Senator from Louisiana [Mr Benjamin]
has taken a somewhat similar course. The Sen-
ator from Gemgin [Mi. Toomhs] who, I think,
can condense about as much contempt and scorn
into his ian^ua?^, if ho entertains such a senti-
ment, any member on this floor, has used very
extraordinary and remaikable language. He says:
'• youu^. tlniwii'i. wioiou* nations aif p-urchaseis; the
weak, the tcio'e, 'lie d"ciei>is, ate ^oher^ It ha- alw.iy-s

That will also 50 to Spam, with the report of
the honoiaijle Senator Tn.ni l,miiMain.
We are told tlmt all this 1.3 not insulting; that
Spain has no right to complain or it. Noiv, sir,
I have no idea tlut a proposition made in diplo-
matic language to any nation to sell one of its
possessions, is, 111 its.'lf, to be considered insult-
ing or offensive, though it may not always be in
very good Uate. 11, pethtipb, would not be in-
