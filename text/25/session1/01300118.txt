CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
arguments of the then President, contained in these
•instructions, to aid the people m forming a correct
estimate of the importance of Texas to the United
States. I do not now propose to argue the merits
of this great question, but I desire to spread before
the people the information contained m the argu-
ments of far abler men, which I here find prepared
to my hand.
But, sir, I apprehend the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts is mistaken in the course he has propos-
ed, if his object is to have all the correspondence
relating to the annexation or purchase of Texas,
printed on this occasion. He complains that the
correspondence is garbled Let him then call, by
a resolution, on the President for that which he
says is suppressed. He can not, by his motion, if
he succeed m carrying it, have that printed which
is not furnished the House.
Mr. ADAMS observed that that would best ap-
pear by showing the House these documents He
wanted all or none. He was opposed to sending
forth garbled extracts as the basis of opinions on a
subject so momsntous The genfeman from South
Carolina had proposed to print extracts fiom the
< deouments favorable to his own peculiar views on
the great question at issue, and not the entire docu-
ments, "jhe President of the United State , m obe-
dience to the call of the House, sends cei tain pa-
pers. The gentleman from South Carolina propo-
ses to print a part of them. Mr Adams said his
proposition was to print the whole He had a right
to argue that the gentleman proposed to print such
extracts as favored one side of the question rather
than the other No conclusion could possibly be
drawn from what had already been communicated,
and the people had a right to all the light that could
he shed upon the subject.
Sir, (said Mr. Adams,) I say on my muherity,
that if such a proposition was ever made on the
part of the United  States to the Government of
Mexico, it was received in such a manner as to
show that it was offensive in the highest degree to
that Government.    If, as  the gentleman from
South Carolina intimates, some   parts of those
documents prove one thing, there may be othei
parte of them which go to prove directly the con-
trary.   If any inference is to be drawn from the
instructions referred to against the mterestsof my
constituents, or against those of that gentleman's
constituents, we ought to have also the answers to
the propositions referred to, and not draw infe-
rences from that which is communicated to us,
which might be entirely refuted by that which has
not been communicated.    ' repeat that, if there
ever was such a proposition made to Mexico, it
was received in such a manner that it never was
repeated, and never ought to be repeated    I have
very strong reason to believe, fuiiher, (said Mr.
A.) that at one time the late Executive of the
United States was deluded into an expectation that
the Mexican" Government weie ready to make a
cession of territory 10 the United States, and, in-
deed, in one of the documents lately communicated
to this House, the Minister from Texas affirms
to the Secretary of Stats, that the late Executive
of the United States was so confident of the aequi-
S'tion of Texas, that he offered to Mr Hotcjiins
G. Burton, or North Carolina, the commission of
Governor of that Territory     [Mr   Adams -was
here reminded by the Speaker that he was trans-
cending the pioper limit of debate  upon a mere
question of printing papers ]  Well, (Mr A said,)
he must then fall back upon the ground of natural
justice, which he said would sufficienily msta n
his argument that all the papers, if am, ought to
go together to the American people
Mr Adams having demanded the 3 eas and na> s
on the motion to amend the resolution, and they
having been ordered to be taken—
Mr. CAMBRELEING moved for tht orders of
the day.
TREASURY NOTE BILL,
The House then resumed the consideration of
the " bill to authorize the issuing of Treasury
notes "
The question pending being the amendment oí
Mi. UNDERWOOD, to authorize theSecietary oí
the Treasury to issue only three millions and a
half of Tieasuiy notes until the bonds ol the Bank
of the United States had been offeed for sale for
three months, exclusive of interest.
Mr. CAMBRELENG appealed to the members
on all sides of the House to bring this measure to
a conclusion. He did not suppose the gentleman
from Kentucky (Mr Underwood) reallv meant to
embarrass the Treasury of the United States, but
his amendment, if adopted, would be the most ex-
traordinary proposition ever adopted by Congress.
His proposition was to authorize the sale of three
bonds, amounting each to about two millions of
interest Now there was not a capitalist on ¡he
face of the earth who Mould bid for them Even
the Bank of the United States, with all its capital,
could not raise the means to do it, \\ ithout the aid
of the Bank of England, for the simple reason that
the bonds could not be divided
Now, what would be the effect of this proposi-
lion? Here was a bill before the House taking
fiom the Secretary of the Treasury the powei to
draw drafts, which destroyed, m one single instant,
the power to diaw for one single dollar to pay the
public creditors, -«ho uere now waiting for these
Treasury notes By the amendment he had the
right to issue only three millions and a half of
notes in the last quarter of the year, thus tying up
his hands for three months, except so far as his re-
liance upon these three millions and a haff only for
the expenses of ihe Government during that time,
w'ien, according to the estimates, at least ten mil-
lions will be required for Ihe same period This
would, m effect, bankrupt the Treasury
Mr C said tie wished too to reach another bill
of primary importance, the divorce bill, before they
adjourned, for he was anxious not to leave the
Treasury and the finances in their piesent unregu-
lated condition In a New York paper he «as
made to say that he nevei intended 10 bring that
bill up lie must have been mistaken in «hat he
said, since he argued quite the reverse
Mr UNDERWOOD had undei stood that there
were capitalists prepared to purchase the bank
bonds, and after a few more words m its support,
he modified his amendment by staking from it the
word , "exclusive of interest "
Mr. LEGARE briefly opposed the amendment,
but remarked upon what he called the unnecessary
course of the Secretary of the Treasury m wi ltmg
to brokers and others about the sale of the notes
before thev were authorized to be issued
I Mr SERGEANT aho remarked, that the Secre-
¡ tarv of the Treasuiy had taken a view of this bill
not vtairanted, either by the languase of the bill,
or by the views of member ot that House, so far
as those views had been disclosed That gentle-
man had vi ntten to brokers and others, all over the
country, to inquire of them at what rate it would
purchase those notes, wheieas there was no autho-
rity m the bill to sell the notes at all
The authority or power of the Secretary of the
Treasury was confined to two points In the first
place, he could only issue them to creditors of the
Government, m satisfaction of £Kl>ts,on their nomi-
nal amount, with the interest thafmay then have
accrued The next pow er was the power to bor-
row upon the hjpothecation of the notes
On the*e points Mr S do elt at some length As
to the constitutional pow ei of the Government to
issue these bills he had no doubt in the world It
had as much constitutional power to do that a to
charter a national bank With reference to th>
wants of the Treasury, he preferred that they
should borrow money of that description, which
■h ould answer the purposes of the Treasnpr
Mr CAMBRELENG said a few uord<¡ in re-
ply to Mr S and gave notice of hii intention to
enter more at large on the subject of the gentle-
man's present and late speech m support of a na-
tional bank, when the divorce bill came up The
gentleman'? argument about the people's money
and the Government's money, was a merely mlcap-
tanthimone, designed to produce an effect upon the
elections in Pennsylvania
Mr C. agreed nilh the gentleman that the Secre-
tar} oí the Treasury had not properly construed
the act now under consideration, for if lie had con-
strued it proper!), there never could be any depre-
ciation whatevfi of these note      Theie vas no
power given in the bill to sell the notes but to boi-
row money upon them
Mr PICKENS made an urgent appeal to the
House, that, considering the lateness oí the session
and the important mea^uies behind, they would
vote on all the propositions now betoie it on this
bill. He declared his intention of voting against
the bill himself ii it embraced ínteres'.
Mr MERCER opposed the bill
Mr UNDERWOOD a am modified his amend-
ment, so as o authorize the Secretary of the Trea-
sury to exchange the bonds with the Bank ol the
United States for smaller bonds
Mr GHOLSON replied principally to the re-
marks of Mr BELL on Saturday last, and spoke
in opposition to the establishment of a national
bank, and m support of the bill, without the
amendment, under consideration. He insisted that
the bill was opposed, and was intended, if possible,
to be defeated, for the express purpose of piomoting
the object to charter a national bank.
Mr BELL spoke briefly 111 reply.
Mr REED animadverted upon what he termed
the miserably erroneous estimates of the Secretary,
and argued against the necessity of passing the
original bill without the amendment, viz to sell the
bank bonds
Mr GHOLSON rejoined to Mr Bjtll, but his
remarks were cut off by the hour having arrive 1
for taking a recess, when the House adjourned till
4 o'clock                     ---------
[PVEVIM, SÍSSION ]
On the Speaker resuming the Chair, a quorum
not being piesent,
On motion of Mr McKAY, a call of the House
was ordered The Clerk commenced calling the
roll, when, a number of the absentees arriving, a
motion prevailed, dispensing u nh all further pro-
ceedings in the call, and the House íesumed the
onsid-Titioi   11"
TEE4SURY NOTR BILL
The question being on the amendment of Mr.
Uvderwood
Mr GHOLSON resumed his íemarks Me was
in favor of granting indulgence to the banks, m
order that they might extend indulgence to then
debtors The gentleman from Tennessee (Mr
Bell) had said something about " Government be-
ing forced into terms," if it would not comply with
the wishes of the banks Did the gentleman
mean to hold out a threat that the banks would in-
crease the distress which now prevailed, by creating
anarchy over the country, if their terms were not
complied with Well, let them do so He cared
not for such threats, neither did he represent a
constituency that was to be influenced by measmes
of intimidation He was sure the administration
were not to be frightened into terms. The object
of the amendment was to benefit the United States
Bank, andfto enable it to reap a benefit to the in-
jury of the country
Mr CURTIS, among all the measures of relief
proposed, preferred the ongmal House bill brought
m by the chairman of the Committee of Ways an I
Means, and he had not been satisfied with the rei-
sons given by that gentleman foi abandoning it,
and introducing that of the Senate He was ot
opinion that the present measure was only calcu-
lated to relieve the Government, whi'e it would
certainly embarrass the people He had a right to
suppose, from the report of the Secretary, that it
was intended to convert a certain portion of the
Treasury note--, bearing interest, into specie The
effect would be that the merchants who had specie
deposited in the banks would draw it out to pin-
chase the notes. The banks, being thus deprived
of their specie, would be effectually pi evented
from resuming specie payments The banks rt-
1 ed on the co-operalion ot their depositors to en-
able them to resume the payment of specie, by
allowing it to remain m their vaults, but their plan-,
would be dustrated by the adoption of this bill
without the amendment It had been said that the
Treasury notes would serve for foreign remittance^,
but in his opinion, that would not be the case, o < -
mg to the short period they had to run Besides
the puce of exchange on London vas now but
about fourteen per cent and he was informed that
