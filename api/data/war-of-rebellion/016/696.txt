CAMP NEAR BUNKER HILL, VA.,

October 2, 1862.

Report of the part taken by the Thirteenth Regiment South Carolina Volunteers in the battle of Ox Hill, Va., on September 1:

Monday, September 1, the brigade, after a march of several miles, was suddenly brought to a halt near Ox Hill and was at once formed in line of battle. The Thirteenth Regiment was on the extreme right. We were ordered to load and fix bayonets. The brigade in part then advanced in line of battle under a galling fire of the enemy to a fence in his front. The fence was thrown down and orders given to commence firing by file. In a short time we were ordered to a wood near by in the rear and instructed to prepare for a charge. The regiment again advanced to its first position, and here, from exhaustion and the effects of a wound received on August 29, I was compelled to turn over the command of the regiment to Captain Duncan.

Of its further movements I cannot speak from personal observation, but am informed that no advance was made and that the regiment lay upon the ground till a late hour at night, and then moved out to bivouac.
