Your dispatch received. I have just reported. I would have done so this morning, but I did not leave bridge till 6.15 this evening, when crossing was completed.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, March 26, 1865.

Major-General HANCOCK, Winchester:

The modification of General Stevenson's order is satisfactory. My attention was called to the subject by complaints of West Virginians, who thought that except in certain cases parties shuld be suffered to remain. As the matter is under your observation I leave it with you.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WASHINGTON, D. C., March 26, 1865-1 p. m.

Major-General HANCOCK, Winchester, Va.:

General Grant is opposed to giving up Winchester for the present. If Lee should fall back to Lynchburg your forces will be required in West Virginia. If he shuld move against Sherman your available forces will be required elsewhere. General Grant cannot decide definitely till Lee's plans are more developed. He wants you, however, to be ready for the field at any moment with all your available forces. The number you can take with you will, of course, depend much upon your line of operations, which cannot be determined at present. In regard to organizing the Eighth Corps, on one has yet been suggested as corps commander. Do you recommend any one? I have telegraphed to General Grant for his opinion.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
