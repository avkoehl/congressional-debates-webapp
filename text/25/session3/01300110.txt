THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 14,
public opinion, as well as every othei in relation
to them, is open to the freest inquiry He did
not, himself believe that they expressed public
opinion as to many of the important topics on
which they undertake to declare it He believed
the people of the State had heard with utter sui
pnse that the subject of the expunging resolu
tions had been introduced It was a topic that
had not been bioughtbefoie them at the election,
and therelore could not have been anticipated
Again, he did not believe they expressed public
opinion, as no question had ever been brought
more directly and immediately bef ne the people
of North Caiolina than that wab, at the elections
m 1834, involving the course of President Jack-
son in íegard to the Bank of the United States,
and the justice of expunging the cemente pi o
notinced against him fion the Journals of the
Senate
The Legislature, at its session of 1834, in obe
dience to that public will, commanded then Sen
atois.by expiess mstiuctions, to vote foi it   The
people elected two successive Legislatmes which
latified and íeaffirmed, m effect, that decision, as
the resolutions remained unrevoked by them   It
would, therefoie, be in deiogation of the well
known political consistency of the people of Noi th
Carolina to suppose that a decision so well con
gideitd.and so delibeiately made, had been ic
versed by them     Wo Piesident had evu   been
more strongly sustained than was Piesident Jack
son, at thiee successive elections, by the people
of that State, whose well earned fame the icsolu
tions which the Legislature had passe d aimed so
strong a blow at   He eould not, tlieref >it, admit
that ins constituents had abandoned then long
eherishedpoluical attachments,and wert piLpaie d
to aid in sacrificing the public character of the
honest soldier and patuot statesman     lie could
not consent, theiefore, to record, by his vote, a
sentence so derogatory to the people and to the
Legislatuit of 1834, to whose favor he was in
debted for his reelection     To resign would, ill
his opinion, be a tacit admission, on his pan, that
the people had changed their opinion on this ques
tion, and an acquiescence in the charge of nicon
Bistency against them, (which it involved,) which
he should considci it a dtpartuie from his duty
to do, unless acting undei instructions that left
him no othei alte i native
He had declaied, in his speech on the constitu
tional Tieasuiy, and on other occasions, that, if
instiucted by his Legislature, hi would obey or
resign   He hud list d tin wind in tint sensi which
Donveys a meaning umveisully acttel on and un
del stood by tin Republican paity of thise mntry,
and had like wise asseitcd it, m his spite lies, to
be a duty, m the absinre of instiuetions, to puisut
the dictates of Ins own judgment    In the abtente
of instruction-;, theiefoie, his decision as to the
present lcsolutiotis, which did not iceogm/c, in
any pan of thou, that light, wasentnely consist
ent with his often íepeatcd declarations on that
bubjeet
Tht couisc which his colleague and himsilf
felt bound to take, fioui  a high  sense of public
duty, on this occasion, involved not  simply the
question of what was due to themselves and then
own principles—not simplj  a question of mere
paity asee ndency, but it involved questions of fai
moie   transeendant  impoitiiiei      It  nivlived a
great ptmciple  of populai  hbeity     If they 11
signed then seats, tht y indirectly aided in utack
nig the gieat fundamental right of nistiuetnn,
which the resolutions, on then fact , not only at
tacked, as he  had aheady shown, but, by tht 11
unquestionable   tendency,   \v< nt   to   ovei throw
Ihey, in effect, as  he had shown, contained   a
denial of that doetune     Poi us,  thcicfiic,  to
acquiesce in them, by obedience 01 it situation,
would aid m subverting a punciple long coime
crated in the Rcoubhcan creed     If they suifeied
thtmsehes, by liidm etion, to be duvtn fiom the
post winch the public had assigned  them, he
could not peimit himself to doubt that the very
paity  that  hid  passed  the ¡esolutions, would
point to them to ptove that their political Ji lends
had novel admitted the doetune of instruction
We should thus be accessoiy to the establish
merit of the doctrine that the people, through their
Legislature, had no right to instruct   We snould
tl us comiibuti to establish the doetune that Sen-
uoi  of the Pedeial paity, if hereafter elected
fiom the State, would be licensed to disobey in-
structions, and should be irresponsible to the
people, as they would no doubt quote these very
resolutions to pi ove that instructions were no part
of then political cieed It would, therefoie, he
íepeated, be, in effect, an attack on the doctrine
of instruction, if we acquiesced in them either by
obedience or resignation, and would be a surren-
der of a great question of public liberty. Thus
we should be placing m the hands of a political
party, aheady denying the right of instruction
and asserting other dangeious doctrines in regard
to popular rights, an immense engine to beat down
those lights It was placing in then hands an
instrument which would serve as a sword to use
agiinst then political adveisanes, and would at
the same time be used as a shield to shelter and
jnotect themselves, when m power, fiom instruc-
tions He, theiefore, should consider the aban
donment of his post, under such circumstances,
as an abandonment of his duty to the people
whom he represented, and as betiaymg a want
of fiiunless to meet tht, crisis He could not le
I spect lumstlf if he were to do it, and he smceiely
i trusted that Ins lnghmincled and intelligent con
stitutnts would apj reciate his motives and the
dehcicy of his situation He had been sustained
' by them with a fhmness and fixedness of pur-
pose, foi a period of more thin nincyeais, through
j many trying and difficultevents m public affans,
J that impitssed him with an indelible sense 01
¿latitude
He had never sought office nor desired it for
himself, noi had any of those conni cted with him
c voi, thiough his meins, enjoyed office undei this
oi the past Admimstiation Ho, theiefoie, ap
pealed to his constituents to decide how fai the
chaige of " pmly senility" applied to him, or to
his public course In order to remove all doubts
as to the motives which actuated him, and to
show that he desired his public couise should be
tested by the populai will of his State, at the first
State elections which nitcivened, he had cometo
the deteimmation to íesign his seat in the Senate
of the United States to the nextLcgislatuicof his
State, when they should assemble, tor the residue
of his term then icmaining
Mr B  said that he felt deeply, and to its fullest
extent, the gre it responsibility of his pi esent sit
uation   Hut at agieat cusís m our public affairs,
when the very existí nee of fiee Government was
at stake, when an evident efloit was making to
I stupthe people of then political soveieignty, and,
in effect, to tiansfi i it to the buikmg corpoiations
if the tommy, he should daic to do his duty
To falter undei such circumstances, and in such
I a c nsis, and to shutik fiom a just responsibility
fiom a feai of consequences, would, while it be-
j tiayed an  unbecoming timidity, be tieachciy to
those who had committed to him their deaiest
lights and mteiests     His course, therefore, was
take n   and it was for his constituents to decide on
| it, mil to that decision he was piepaied to yield
I with entne dtfe renoe
j     Mi   STRANGE said   It is with great reluc-
tance, Mr   Piesident, that I occupy the public
j time and attention  of the Senate , upon mitteis
I which se e in propeily to icst between om constit
uents and my colleague and myself     Two  em
sideiatnns, however,   piomj t   me  to occupy a
poi tion of both   The one is, the established piac
Ui e, so f n a  I un able tojudge, prevailing m this
body, on like occasions, and the other, its being,
in my judgmi nt, the most conv erne nt and íespect
fui mode of throwing immediately before out con
stituents om puiposes, with a shoit statement of
the ltisons which govern us     I find myself in
one  of the most lesponsible positions I have evei
occupied, and my anxious wish  Ins been soto
act is to insuie, at least, the unwaveung appro
| batioii of my own conscie nee   From my political
adicrsaues, I have learned to know, by sad ex
peiience, that I have no favor to hope for, and
i         ven justice to expect     Act as I may, my
conduct will be misiepiesented and my motives
impeacned Even fiom my political filends, I
have leason to appiehend division m their judg-
ment of my coutse, while I know they will do jus-
tice to my motives
The resolutions just lead come fiom a source
entitled to my highest respect and most deferential
consideration They are from the Legislatuieof
a State to which lam deeply indebted, ways with
out numoei Though but an adopted son of that
State, she has heaped upon me kindnesses far,
very far, beyond my deserts, and I have enjoyed
golden opinions far beyond my merits from all
sorts of people Though not a native of the
State, theie has my heart found the objects of its
tendeiest affections, and thither does it tuin in-
stinctively when that magic woid " home" stirs
within it those holy associations which no other
word has powei to awaken Coming, then, fiom
such a source, how gladly would I have found
myself able to follow in any dnection to which
they might point ' how cheerfully have reposed
upon such a counselor, and thrown off the re-
sponsibility of acting upon my own fallible judg-
ment' Had thpse resolutions been couched m
terms of command, no alternative would have
oeenleftmebutobedienceoi resignation Coming,
as they do, meiely in the language of counsel or
advice, I should unhesitatingly follow that coun-
sel could 1 do so consistently with my sense of
duty and my own self íespect But the first two
of these resolutions counsel me to that which not
all the tenors of an «ufo deje could induce me to
perform Gracious heaven' to place upon the
everlasting lecords of my countiy my own dec-
laiation that I had violated hei Constitution, upon
the infamous motive of party servility' No'
sooner would I bite off my tongue, and spit it back
in 'he faces of those who had counseled such in-
famy, how evpi high and dignified the stations
they migh t fill No ' conscious as I am of having
been actuated in what I did by motives the high-
est, the puiest,thc most patnotic, I am proud to
li ive my name associated with the act, and am
content thatposteuty in ly ¡udgeof meby ltalone
Mistaken I may hi\e been, but never was cor
ruption fuither fiom my heait If those were
coirupt who did the deed, what weie the Legis-
latures of the noble States who commanded it to
be done> I myself, in the part I acted, but con-
formed to the express instiuetions of the Legis-
latuie of North Caí ohna A Legislature elected
when that question was distinctly before the
people, and, notwithstanding those instiuetions
were given, a Legislatuie a majonty of which
was favorable to those instiuetions was again
elected I could not, therefoie, with proper re-
spect to the Legislatuit and people of North Car
olma by whose command the act was done, cen-
sure it in the manner pioposed, if there was
nothing else to restiain me
Par be it from me, in thus remarking upon the
resolutions, to impeach the motives or impugn the
conduct of those who passed them My own
opinion is, that family quanels should nevei be
carried beyond the paternal domain, and, if I have
anything to complain of in the tempei, language,
oi substance of these íesolutions, on a different
theatci will that complaint be made Here, at
least, it is my wish and my puipose always to
speak respectfully of those whom the people of
Noi th Caí olma shall see fit to elevate to high
places
The terras of the íesolution having placed con-
formity to them entirely out of the question, it
remains to be consideieel what is my alternative
course Weie I at liberty to consult the sug-
gestions of impassioned personal pude, I should
oeitamly resign It is always easier to retreat
fiom a difficulty oi dangei than to encounter it,
and abide the issue When a man gets into a
political difficulty, the shades of piivate life have
many attractive charms, and upon them he is apt
to cast a wishful eye Foi my pirt, 1 acknowl-
edge that I fee! myself in a political difficulty,
from winch I would willingly u treat, if 1 might
do so with piopnety But the question is one of
duty simply, and not of choice If it is not my
duty to resign.it is my duty to lemain heie One
oi theothei isclearly obligatory onme,and which,
is the question As I said before, had these i es-
olutions been couched in the language of com-
mand, obedience or resignation would have been
my duty I accepted the tiust I now hold, under
the full knowledge that those who sent me heie
expected me to obey instiuetions when re ceived,
oi resign Such is the cieed of the political party
thatelected me, and Ishould disappoint their ex-
pectations if I refused to act upon that principle,
but, on the othei hand, I should be guilty of ti each-
eiy to them if, upon any othei ground than a high
sense of duty, I sui rendered the post to which
they have assigned me If the legislative elec-
tions m North Carolina weie shortly to occui,
my position would  be clear of all difficulty     I
