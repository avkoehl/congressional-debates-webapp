HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865-7.40 p. m. (Received 8.40 p. m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Captain Sheridan, from Sheridan's cavalry, is here, and is directed to you by a staff officer. He reports that General Sheridan is just north of Dinwiddie Court-House, having been repulsed by the enemy's infantry on the dirt road running north and also on the road running northwest from north of Dinwiddie. General Sheridan states that if he is forced to retire it will be on the Vaughan road. The staff officer leaves here to report to you.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865-8 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

From what Colonel Kellogg, the bearer, says it is evident Sheridan cannot hold Dinwiddie and will have to fall back to-morrow. If I do not contract my lines, cannot Ferrero [Turner] be sent at once out the Vaughan road to support Sheridan? I think this will be the quickest thing that can be done.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
