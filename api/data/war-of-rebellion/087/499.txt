Mott's division; sixth, the wagon train. A battery will accompany each division. The whole will move at 6 a.m.; the cavalry as much sooner as practicable. The route will be just south of the Yellow Tavern, of the Gurley houses, of the Smith house, and of the Temple house, and then turning south along the Jerusalem plank road to the crossing of the Nottoway River, at Freeman's Bridge. General Gregg will use a brigade of cavalry or a sufficient force forward to protect the right flank and cover the rear of the wagon train, watching and holding all the roads toward Reams' Station and the roads coming from the Rowanty Creek until the train is past. General Ayres will furnish a brigade of infantry to accompany the wagon train as guard. The train will be under Colonel Thomas, at the Gurley house. The ambulances of division will accompany the division.

By command of Major-General Warren:

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NOTE.- During to-morrow headquarters will be at the head of General Crawford's division.

HEADQUARTERS,Nottoway River-4 a.m.

Generals MOTT and CRAWFORD:

General Ayres is massing his division about a mile from the river. The bridge is nearly laid and the engineers are making another. General Mott, if delayed in his march, can mass up as close to General Ayres as the nature of the country will enable him to do. This will enable General Crawford to close up on him.

Very respectfully,

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
