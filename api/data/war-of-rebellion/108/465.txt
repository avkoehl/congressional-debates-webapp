LEESBURG, VA., February 7, 1862.

Hon. J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War, C. S. A.:

SIR: With the approbation of the general commanding the Army of the Potomac, three forts were begun at this place. One is complete, capable of holding 400 men and twenty-four guns. It can only be taken by a regular siege. Another is about half done, and a third has a good deal of work done on it. These three forts, when finished, properly manned, and supplied with ordnance will secure this wealthy county and effectually prevent the long-contemplated flank movement on Manassas. I would therefore respectfully ask for an increase of force here, and for guns of long range to be placed in position in the forts.

With great respect,

D. H. HILL,

Brigadier-General.

Wha kind of guns are wanted for these forts?

[J. P. BENJAMIN.]

[Third indorsement.]

Two rifled guns of long range (4-inch and 6-inch rifled guns) have been sent. Besides those he has received, within a short time, three 3-inch rifled pieces. Same kind of guns would answer, and 8-inch siege howitzers, which are being made here slowly.
