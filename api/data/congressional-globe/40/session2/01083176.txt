,, on Appropriations, to whom was referred the
- bill (S. No. 465) for the erection of school-
houses and the maintenance of schools in the
District of Columbia outside of the cities of
washington and Georgetown, instruct me to
report the same back and ask to be discharged
from its further consideration, and that it be

desired, to move this on the miscellaneous
appropriation bill.
The report was agreed to.
Mr. MOREILL, of Maine, from the Com-
mittee on Appropriations, to whom was referred

the Special Commissioner of the Revenue to act
as superintendent of the Bureau of Statistics
in the office of the Secretary of the Treasury,
asked to be discharged from its further con-
sideration, and that it be referred to the Com-
mittee on Finance: which was agreed to.
Mr. SUMNER, from the Committee on
Fo reigu Relations, to whom was referred the
message of the President of the United States,
communicating a report from the Secretary of
State, in relation to recent, events in the empire
of Japan, moved that itbe printed ; which was
agreed to.
He also, from (he same committee, to whom
was referred the petition of Stephen G. Mon-
tano, submitted a report, accompanied by a
bill (S. No. 5-53) to pay Stephen (x. Montauo,
a citizen of Peru, an unpaid balance of money
awarded to him by the mixed commission
authorized by the convention of January 12,

BILLS INTRODUCED.
Mr. MOREILL, of Maine, asked, and by
unanimous consent obtained, leave to intro-
duce a joint resolution (S. R. No. 146) author-
izing the sale of certain bonds belonging to
the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians, and the
adjustment and payment of certain claims
against them; which was road twice by its
title, and referred to the Committee on Indian
Affairs.
Mr. FERRY asked, and by unanimous con-
sent obtained, leave to introduce a joint reso-
lution (S. Iv. No. 117) for the relief of Jona-
than S. Turner: which was read twice by its
title, and ordered to be printed.
Mr. SHERMAN asked, and by unanimous
consent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S.
No. 5o4) to promote commerce among the
States and to cheapen transportation of the
mails and military and naval stores ; which was
read twice by its title.
Mr. SHERMAN. In regard to the refer-
ence of that bill, I have consulted some mem-
bers of" the Committee on Commerce, to whom
some might suppose it should properly go, or
to the Committee on Post Offices and Post
Roads. As the bill is a very important one,
proposing to construct railroads from the city
of Washington in different directions, and as
there is a great deal of dispute about the right
to do so, J will move that.it be referred to a
select committee ; I do not expect any action'
upon it at this session, but with a view that the
select committee may turn their attention to
the subject and report early iu the next ses-
sion.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Of how
many shall the committee be composed?
Mr. SHERMAN. Seven, to be appointed
by the Chair. The committees' to whom the
matter woidd naturally be referred haveagreat
deal of business on hand.
The PRESIDENTjwtepore. It is moved
that the bill be referred to a select committee
to consist of seven members.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. SHERMAN. I also move that the bill
be printed.
The motion was agreed to.
Messrs. Siiep.max, Sumxer, Chandler, Ram-
sey, Stewart, Buckalew, and Vickers were
appointed the committee.

the treaty with those tribes of April 28,1868, and to

REMOVAL OP POLITICAL DISABILITIES.
Mr. STEWART. I move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of House bill No.
10-5!).
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
consider the bill (H. R. No. 1059) to relieve
certain citizens of North Carolinaofdisabilities.
Mr. STEWART. Mr. President, there are
before the Senate several reports from the
Judiciary Committee on this subject; one to
relieve citizens of North Carolina 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Would it
not be well to have the bill read first?
Mr. STEWART. Allow me one word of
explanation. There have been reported from
the committee several propositions of this sort;
a bill to remove disabilities from citizens of
North Carolina, and also, a bill to remove dis-
abilities from citizens of Alabama. The com-
mittee have considered a large number of other
names in an informal way, arid I desire to pro-
pose, iu lieu of the bill that is before the {Sen-
ate, an amendment, in the nature of a substi-
tute, containing a variety of names. I twill be
unnecessary, therefore, to read the original bill.
The substitute that I offer contains all the
names embraced in the bill, and also combines
all the bills that have been reported, and those
that have been sÂ«nt to the Judiciary Commit-
tee on this subject.
Hie PIlESi'lJENT pro tempore. The read-
ing of the original bill will be dispensed with
unless it is called for by some Senator, and
the substitute only will be read.
The Chief Clerk proceeded to read the
amendment, which was to strike out all after
the enacting clause of the bill and to insert
the following in lieu thereof:
(Two thirds of each House concurring therein,)
