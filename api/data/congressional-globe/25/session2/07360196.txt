H. oí Reps,
tended e* dently to prevent the commission of certain
acts, which, in lie judgment of the committee,
were in \ íolation of our national obligations. The
possession of the means, connected with the unlaw-
ful intent, constituted the case which the commit-
tee intern ed to i eich. The only, or the best mode
to accom pish this object, was to pursue the same
mode as that which had long prevailed in all simi-
n\ ca"s—as in. the case of persons having in pos-
session implements for making counterfeit money,
with intent to use them for that purpose In that
case, the possession ot such implements, or of the
counteileit money itself, afiorded evidence, to some
extent, ol the unlawful intent, because Mich posses-
sion nai unusual,and, in general, unnecessary, ex-
cept to accomplish the unlawful act, but in this tas 
•he r>osse°sionof arms affords no such presumption,
our Constitution and laws presume that eveiy citi-
zen has arms and niuaitions of war, hence thete
was much more need in this than in ordinary cases
to have proof made, showing the "facts and circum-
srances"—some overt act from which unlawful in-
tent could be interred And what is still more sin-
gular is, that the bill does not make the act unlaw -
ml for the imputed intention of doing which the
citizen is made liable to have his property seized,
and is hold to grv e bonds and sureties An> one
may lawfully have in possession the articles enu-
merated, with the intent to use them in the manner
described He may carry that intent into effect
and be conscious of violating no law of his coun-
try, and subject to no punishment And yet certain
officers are required to seize that pioperty, if they
íhmk it probable hemtends to use ltm that manner
The bill dep-rls from the ordinary and well-tried
usages of penal jurisprudence Those usages have
the advantage of long experience,—they have been
raeulded to utility and safety by the judgments of
courts and the learning of counsel It seems to me,
said Mr L that in ordei to cany out the recom-
mendation of the President with prudence and safe-
ty, and effectually, the act should first make it an
offence to procure the arms, &c with the intent ts
make that use of them which its object is to pro-
hibit, and should attach a pioper penalty for tint
offence The individual offending would then be
subject to be arrested for violating a penal statute,
under ordinary process of law And the act might
then, with much propriety, for greater safety, and
as an additional penalty, authorize the seizuie of
(he property thus intended to be applied to unlaw-
ful purposes But, even then, it must be done un-
der judicial process bitch a law, he could not
doubt, would prove a lar more effectual preventive
measure than the p'esenf bill, oy exposing its vio-
lator to the arrest of his person as an oñender, and
exposing hirn to pains and penalties, as well as the
seizure of his prcperty, while it would preserve the
constitutional rights of the citiren, and conform to
die established usage of our civil jurisprudence
The third section of the bill presented another
'«ature, which vas also liable to the most serious
objection That section nude it the duly ol the
numerous olucers designated m it to sewe the
arms of iny body of armed men who should come
■Within our limits and jurisdiction, and who had
been engaged in carrying on hostilities against any
conterminous country w ith which we are at peace
This secuoi ts too extensive in its application
instead of securm? us against being involved in
fore gn quarrels, its literal execution would, in
some cases, lead Us into ihem He would suppose
n. case, to I'lustrate this view of its application
Suppose a \ at should exist between the English
Government and some other foreign power, (say
Russia, or any other European nation,) and a na-
tional sh p o' tne latter, which had been engaged in
hat wai, should put into the port of New York

By the provwons of this third section, ¿ W0Hlíl te

them This clearly was too palpable a violation
of the laws of nations and the lights of belligerents,
to have been intended by the framen ot this bill
and ) et there does not appear to be any escape from
that construction of it as it leads
Mr L said he regretted extremely tint he hid

NORTIICAS1TRN BOUNDARY
SPEECH OF MR FAIHFIELD,
Oi   Mum
In the House of Representative1!, Match 8,  1S13—
Upon die subject ol lhe Northi isiern Boundary
Mr  FAIRTUXD  Hidrevse.il the Iloiw   as (ol
lows
Mr Srf mi r I am in f ivor of the bill winch
my colleague [Mr t * t\s| proposes to introduce
What is u, sir' Why, it simply provides ihat the
President cause the Northeastern boundary line of
the United Slates " tei be accurately surveyed mil
marked, and suitable monuments in be cieetirt
thereon, at such points as may be deemeel neces^a-
r) and important " Anil it is n measure so just
and reasonable in itsell, and so linpe ratrvely de-
manded by the circumstances of the case, that I
trust no meinbe r in this House w ill feci a disposi-
tion to oppose it
In Maine, there is but one feeling upon this sub-
ject That btale, sir, feels that she has suffered
deep and enduring wrongs at thc hands ol the Bn
tish Government She knows that she has been
illegally and unjustly deprived of the property and
jurisdiction in i poition of her teiruorv, that the
valuable timber upon that territory has been the
subject of plunder and vv isle, that her citi/cns have
been sei/cel and imprisoned in foreign jails, without
law and without right aid lhat the nition guilty
ol the^e muliiphe 1 in I gre>s-, outrages not only tie -
mes re Iress but re fosos oven to agree upon a mode
by which the legahl) oí heraciscm be tried anel
in amicable adjustment of the duliculties can be
effected That Stale also feeK that "she has not
been treated by the Geneial Government is she has
endeavored to deserve ' though, m her complaints
upon this subject, she goes a hltk father bac k than
my colleague found >t for his purpose to go
This, sir, is no party question in Mame I  ]•>
true, there have been several attempts to make it a
party question but these attempts have always
proved abortive And this bill, introduced by mv
colleague, was jgreed upon b\ the delegation from
Maiae without regard to politics or part), anel j
introduced in pursuance of an arrangement be
tueen them It was with extieme regr«t, there-
fore that 1 found my col'eague disponed to mike it
the basis of an attack upe the Administration—to
mingle it with party politics, and, -perhaps, to send
a speech home, to co operate with similar eflorts
making there Sir, I think no good can come of
this course in any waj, and I regret exceedingly
that it should have been tnought u ise to adopt it
gut this regret, great as it was, did not exceed my
su>-pi ise end astonishment a hearing him eulogise
the Adminestiation of )82f>, while condemning, m
seveie teims, the succeeding one, in refeience to
ihen reipectn e aclion upon this subject The first,
it is said, nobly asserted and maintained our rights;
while the other, bv concessions, frittered away, and
finally abandoned them Sit, I think this declara-
tion will be received with some surprise at home,
too tor the general opinion there, as 1 have sup-
posed, has alwa)s been dnee tly the reverse of this.
Anel, as the dooi to this investigation has been
opened, I trust I shall he pardoned for walk-
ing in, and as'iing the House to go back with me
'o a period somewhat beyond that, to which it seem-
ed to be conven ent for my colleagse to extend hi 
inquiries I will then endeavor to show, that
Maine has been exceedmgl) ill tieated, not only by
the Bntish Government, but by our own Govern-
ment, and by that Administration, too, which has
received the warm encomiums of my colleague
In eloing this, I beg the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts [Mr Adams] to believe that it will not be
from any feelings of personal nnkmdness or dis-
lespect to him I shall refer to Ins acts, merely as
a put ol the history of the case, and only because
I fed compelled to it, by the course of my col-
li i«,ue upon ibis subject Besides, if 1 succeed in
mj attempt, it wni affoid an additional reason for
the passage of the bill, foi, corresponding with the
extent of wrongs suffered by Mame, will be the
me asure of her right to redress. II she has been
dovhly wronged, then is she doubly entitled to iehe}
bit, if I have not totally misapprehended the hts-
lorj of this matter, almost every step in. the pro-
,icss of the case, taken by the Administration al-
ludftl to, was adveise to the interests and wishes of
Maine, and, m most instances, against her solemn
protest lint Administration did little or nothing

tention of the [I u e to a tow prominent ones In.
the lie it) ol Gli nt it was provided that commis-
sion! is sliou'el 1 e appointed to ascertain that point
in the highlands Is ing due north from the source of
neb! ( ioix, constituting the northwest angle of
Nov a Se otia, and to survey the line extending from
the souice of the St Croix to the highlands, and
aloiu lhe highlands to the northwestermnost head
ol C mneciicut river These commissioners having
been appointed m conformity with the treaty, ex-
tendi- el their official labors ihrough a period of about
five )ears, without being able to agree, and closed
then commission by making repoits to their respec-
tive Governments In the progress of the case, a
vast number oi documents lclatmg to it were col-
lected, winch, with the statements or argumeit of
the commissioner, vveie deposited herein the na-
tional archives Copies of these documents Mame
was exceedingly anxious to obtain, and, as eaily
as 183b, moved in lhe malter, by the Legislature
authoring the Governor to piocure them, and at
the same time malting an appropriation of $500 to
defray lhe expense of it, should there be any.
And will it I e believed, su, that our Governor per-
seveied i i his efi iris foi a period of over two and
a hall )tars before he succeeded m obtaining
tliem'i f lis reejuests vveie presented m a variety of

Mr ( lav, then Secictiry of Slate, pmiraciously
refused to furnish them, or have them furnished'
May 29, J827, the Governor, having disconti-
nued his unsuccessful efforts with the Secretary of
State, addressed himself directly to the President.
In answer to this call, m October following, the
copies were furnished, two and a half years having
been spent m the accomplishment of that desirable
object In support of these statements, I beg leave
to refer to documents now before me.   Ctoveruoj"
