Sept 1837.                      APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                              179
25th CoNG....lst Sess.                            Making public officers depositories—Mr. Clay.                                                     Senate.
of that lofty heroism, that devoted valor, that burn-
ing patriotism which characterised former and
better days. True, sir, we develope more physical
resources, but is there moie sentiment, more virtue,
more honesty? What is it that constitutes a gieat
people1 Is it power—is it wealth—is it numbers1
No, sir! It is virtue—valor—devoted patriotism—
arms—eloquence, and letters These are the quali-
ties that have covered otheis with immortality, and
kmdle in the heart of man all that is noble and
spirit-stirring.
All society seems now to receive its hue and cast
from those who hold the moneyed power of the
world. Even our interior villages, painted as they
are, and dressed up in all their show, receive, in
submission, their fashions from the dandies of
Broadway, and kneel m reverence befoie the molten
images that idolaters raise up for worship in Wall
street and London. The tendency oí all these
things is to constitute society into one living mass,
and I war against it, because, if it succeed, my
peculiar section, and ihe peculiar institutions
existing in it, will be overwhelmed
In reference, Mr Chairman, to the details of the
bill under consideration, I will only sav lhat, upon
that point, I have mv own peculiar no'ions But
the bill asserts a gieat principle for which I con-
tend—that principle which I believe to be identified
with the liberties of this countiy. I will go for it,
and hold the admimstiation responsible for its
details. I do not choose to propose any amend-
ments in those details for, if it be bunghngly or
injudiciously arranged, I will not be held «sponsi-
ble. I go for it, sir, because it asserts those princi-
ples which belong to the Constitution of my
country; but I leave the details to the administra-
tion to execute, and I shall hold them iesp msible
for it. I go for that great leading feature which
separates this Government fiom all connection
whatever with State banks, or any great mother
institution here. I am lor it, because I have seen
the fatal consequences upon the Government and
banks themselves
Sir, we have had these institutions,  as I said
before,   entering directlv and indirectly into the
political canvass of the day, dispensing power, and
controlling, as I believe, to a great extent, the elec-
tive franchise , and we have seen the results, and
heard the shouts of triumph ¡aised around the fu-
neral pile here upon which the  Constitution was
placed, and a fiendish joy seemed to light the coun-
tenances of hundreds, even while the smoke thereof
rose as a sweet incense to that popular idol which
we were all called upon lo ki eel down and worship
before, as the only true and livim? image of demo-
cracy     And am I now to put this Government in
the same position agamí    Let gentlemen beware
how they  unite  the  political with the  banking
power again     Have wc not seen enough to give
us lessons of wisdom in the dreadful consequences
that have resulted from warring uoon the institu-
tions oí the country1   And,  sir, in  this conflict
who have been  the greatest suflprers1     The in-
dustry of the country—men who have vested their
all in the enterprise of the day, and who hate been
left to the meicy oí contending foes     It is lo sepa
rate these, and to avoid this result in tmure, thai I
am for this bill, for who can iook at the future and
not see how some bold and designing demagogue
ma  desire to rise into power, and contend for po-
litical influence, by calling up the  lasest passions
and piejudices against any   institution  which you
may deem to be stable and fixeci1    lie may wage
a war of extermination, aid may ride over the
laws of ms country     I desire no such conrlict, m
which the hones'y, the mdus'ry, and the entei prise
of all will be lelt to the nurcy of ¡action copend-
ing for power over an institution in whicn the des-
tinies ol this country, thiough its cuuency, are to
be placed.   And if such a content should come, I
could not with   any  heart sustain an  institution
which I believe to  be agamst Ihe Constitution and
the liberties of the country
Mr Chairman, my fnend (and I use die t rm in
no idle manner) from Vngima, (Mr Wise) the
other day, warned me that, on this measure, 1
should be "left m the luich " S r, on a question
of this land, affecting ihe liberties of my countiy,
I never stop to inquire whether I shall be " left in
the lurch" or   not    I never slop to inquire who
may be with me ot who may be against me, on a
question of lhat character. All 1 ask myseli is, js
it a constituiii nal proposition, and if it be light and
correct lo maintain it, I never stop to inquire who
is with me or who is against me The mere tri-
umphs of party I disregard. I throw aside party
considerations where a gieit question is concerned,
m which the liberties and destinies oí the people
and the Government are involved On such a
question, sir, I subscribe to no party creed. Let
me also say to those gentlemen who suppose lhat
the tide of popularity upon which they aie now
floating,is for ever to set m one direction, that they
will find the future full of bitterness and disap-
pointment.
Let them not labor under the fatal delusion that
the letter writers and newspapers of the day are to
create lhat popularity which is to endure through
time. Let them rather look to that deep, settled,
abiding opinion which is to come back to us from
the enlightened and reflecting free men of this
country—come back to us upon ihe settled convic-
tion of what is true, of what is constitutional, of what
is for the gocd of the Government and the people
Let us all look lo (hat deep and fixed public opi-
nion, formed upon enlightened conviction and
sound discretion Allow me now to sav, in the no-
ble language of Loul Mansfield, lhat those whi
have foiegone that pleasing adviser, and given up
theirmindsto be the slave of evei y popular irnpuls ,
I smceiely pity. I pity themsull more íl their vanity
leads them to mistake the shouts of a mob for the
trumpet of fame Expenence might inform them
that many who have received the luidas of a
crofld one day, have been vw'cd with its execra-
tions the next And many who, by the popular ty
of the times, have been held up as spotless patt lots,
have nevertheless appeared upon the historian's
page, where truth has triumphed over delusion, the
assassins of Liberty.
SPEECH OF MR. CLAY,
Of Kentucky.
In Senate, September 2S, 1837—The bill "imposing
additional duties, as depositories in certain caseb,
on public officers," being under consideration—
Mr. CLAY rose and addicted the Senate up-
wards of thiee hours     Wc cannot undertake to le-
port all that he said     We must content ouiselves
with exhibiting a view of his argument, employ ing
generally the language in which it was expressed
He commented by observing that, feeling an anx-
ious desire to See some effectual pian p esented lo
conect the disorders in the cuneney, and to restoie
the prosperity of the country he had avoided pre-
cipitating himself into the debate now in progress,
that he might attentively examine every remedy
that should  be proposed, and ímpiiuaily weigh
eveiy consideration uiged m its support     Ino pe-
riod had evei existed in this country, in which the
future was coveied bv a darker, denser, or more
impenetrable gloom     JNone, in which the duty was
so imperative to discard all passion and prejudice,
all paity ties, and previous bias, and look exclu-
sively to the good of our afilio ed countiy     In one
íespect—and he thought it a foituiuu" one—our
present difficulties are distinguishable fro n for ner
domestic troubles, and  lhat is  then   universality
Tney are felt, it is true, in diflerent degiees, but
they reach eveiy section, even State,eveiy mteie-t,
almosteveiy man in the Uiiion     All feel,see,heai,
know then existence     As they do not arrav,like
our former divisions, one poition  of the confeder-
acy against anotner, it is to be ho; cd that common
sufferings may lead to common sympathies and com-
mon counsels, and that we shall, at no distant day,
be able to see a clear way of de'n erance     If the
presant state of the country were pro luced by the
fault  ot  the People,  if  it puxeeded  from the.r
wasteful extravagance and then   indulgence of a
reckless  spirit  of   ruinous speculation,  if public
measuies had no agency whatevei in bunging it
about, it would nevertheless be the duty of G iverti-
ment to exert all its energies and to employ all its
legitimate powers to devise an efficacious lemedv
Rut if our present deplorable condition has sprung;
from our rulers, if it is to becleailv tiaced to their
acts and opeiations, that duty bee >mcs mfinitelv
i! more obligator , and Government wou'd be faith-
less to the highest and most solemn of human trusts
should it neglect to perform And it i« not too ti ue
that the evils which surround us are to be ascribed
to those who have had the conduct of our public
affairs i                                                              >
In glancing at the past, (continued Mr. C) no-
thing can be furthei from my intention than to ex-
cite angry feelings, or to find grounds of reproach.
It would be far more congenial to my w shes that,
on this occasion, we should forget all former un-
happy divisions and animosities But, m Older to
discover how to get out of out difficulties, we mmt
ascertain, if we can, how we got into them.
Prior to that series of unfoitúnate measures
which had for its object the o- eithrow of the Bank
of the United States and the discontinuance of its
fiscal agency for the Government, no People upon
earth ever enjoyed a better cuirency, or had ex-
changes better regulated, than the People of the
United Slates Our monetaty system appeared to
have attained as great peiiection as any lhi> g hu-
man can possibly reach. The combmati in of Uni-
ted States and local banks presented a true image
of our system ot Geneial and State Governments,
and worked quite as well. Wot only withm the
countiy had we a local and a geneial currency per-
fectly sound, but m whatever quaiter of the globe
American courneiee had penetrated, there also did
the bills of the Bank of the United Stales command
unbounded credit and confidence Now vve aie in
danger of having fixed upon us, indefinitely as to
time, that medium—an uredeemable paper curren-
cy, which by the universal consent of the commer-
cial world is regirded as the worst How has this
rev eise come upon us1 Can it be doubted that it
is the result of those measuies to which I have ad-
vened1 When at the verv moment ol adopting
them, the very consequences which have happened
were foretold as inevitable, is it necessary to look
elsewhere foi then cau e1 Nctdr was prediction
more distnctiy made, never was fulfilment moie
lueial and exact.
Let us suppose that those measures had not been
adopted, that the Bank of the United States had
been rechartered, that the public deposites had re-
mained undistuibed, and that the Treasury order
had never issued is there not every reason to be-
lieve that we should be now in the enjoyment of a
sound eunency, lhat the public deposites would be
now safe and loiIncoming, and that the suspension
of specie payments in May last would not have
happened1
The President's message assorts that the suspen-
sion has proceeded from ovei-action—over-tiadmg
—the indulgence of a spit it of speculation produced
by bank and other facilities I think this is a view of
the case entirely too superficial It would be quite
as correct and just, m the ins anee ot a homicide
poipetratel by the discharge of a gun, to <illege
that the leaden ball, and not the man wh i k' elled
the piece, «as responsible for the murder The
Hue inquiry is, how came that excessive over-tia-
dmg, and tho ,e extensive bank facilities which the
message describes1 Were they not the necessary
and immediate consequences of the ovei ihrow of
the bank, and the removal fiom its custody of the
public deposites1 And is nx this proven by the
vast multiplication of banks, th increase of the line
of their discounts and accommodations prompted
and stimulated bv Secretary Tanav, and the great
augmentation of their circulation which ensued?
What occurred in tke State of Kentucky, in con-
sequence of the veto of the recharter of the Bank of
the United States, illustrates its effects thioughout
the Union    That  State had suffered < reatl^   bj
banks     It was geierally opposed to tne rc-estab-
hshment of them     It had found Ihf notes oí the
Eink of the United States answering all tne pur-
poses of a sound currency at home a il abroad, and
it was perreelly coateti'ed with them     At the pe-
nod of tne vets, it had but a single bank, of limited
caiital and circulation     Aft/n it, the State, reluc-
tant to engage in the banking s\ stem, and still cher-
ishing hopes of the creation ol a new Bank of the
United States, encouraged by the supporters of the
late President, hesitated about the incorporation of
new banks     But, at length despairing of tne estab-
lishment of a Bank of the United States and finding
itself exposed to a currency in bank notes from ad-
acent States, it proceeded to establish banks of it*
