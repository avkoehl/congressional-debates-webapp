H. of Reps.
by creating abroad the necessity of sending specie
to the United States, by balancing, m oth"r woids,
the demand now setting against vis, bj one m onr
favor, and this I would effect, either bv instituting
a temporary loan, the securities oí wh'ch might,
and would go abroad, or by a sale in London of the
bonds of the Bank of the Uniled State*, which we
now hold
The rate of exchange which at present exposes
the specie of our mixed < urrency to a foreign dram
has varied in five and twenty ycais fui'y per cent ,
foreign Mis which have recently Deen twenty pel
cent abo\ e, ha tug been, in 181 2; twe 15 p"r c. nit
belo\  par
Since our arrival here, foreign etchaige has
fallen 5 p Ji cent, and the prcriiaro. gran for ecra-
veiarig current bank notes m o sp°<.ie has falle 1, m
amount one ha'f The p-ice of Ae bans, notes oí
this Distuct, which|\vere 10 peí cent below specie,
m value are now with n 5 pei cent of par
From the best intelligence we have received,
though all information on such a subject is hable to
great uncertainty, between five and six million of
specie have been exported to England in payment
of the foreign debt of our mei chants, and has eon
tributed, with other causes, to produce that improve-
ment of the foreign exchange to which I have re-
ferred Instead of causing a further depieciation
of our paper currency, this large remittance of
specie, or gold bullion, by helping to restore confi-
dence in the mtegi lty and solvency of our merchants,
has ielaxed, as might have been expected, the pres-
sure of their creditorsfrom abroad, and diminished,
to that extent, the demand for specie
With thisevidenee before us, it cannot bedoubted
that a loan of six millions, by supplying the means
of remittance, or a sale m Europe of the bonds of
the Bank of the United States, which we held to
that amount, would most essentially contribute to
the same happy result
If it be objected that the fust expedient, which i<r
the more simple of the two, and more likely to prove
efficient, would create a new national debt, I reply
that we are reduced to a choice of evils, and the
issue of Tieasury notes, eithei Avith or without in-
terest, is the creation of a debt to«he extent of their
nominal sum, whether they are made to bear mtet-
est or not They are, some time or other, to be re-
deemed by their íeception m dtschaigc of the public
dues, or their payment in specie
So far as they may serve for a currency at home,
they will directly interfere with the resumption of
specie payments, by supplanting that of the ban'to
If the silbad *t speculation, and not, therefore, c ur
rent m the course of ev h-uige,, thev lutvc every
quality oí the mere evidences of ana'ional debt,
with ml a capacity to be used for remittances abi oad
The proposition toissui suchnoies, it js remarka-
ble, 'It- late e\C"tilive menage retomm-nds, m the
stme hteath, \\ ith nhieh it denounces, as unponnlai
the. ueation ol aiipwdebt, "ad the friends of the
administiauon follow in the cry, Tid talk of a party,
who regard "a national debt as an 1 íotial blessing "
Tins is but a ~vival of a s> de slander upon the
fust Secreta)y oí the Treasury, which was without
the slightest foundation m truth, was both contra-
dicted bv his ii tends, and denied by himself, but,
nevertheless, utteied by his enemies, until it was
believed
Bat toe sale of fh= bonds of the Bank of the
United States, amounting to near Six millions, and
beaung an interest of six pel cent, isfree from any
conceivable «bjcction, except that of one of my
colleagues, (Mr Tones,) who charges the motion of
my fnend iromKenltu ley (Mi Underwood,) with
an attempt to convert the Tieasmy 11 to a " shaving
shop,' I trnote his words Tías the honorable
member forgot the íecommendation of the Secre-
tary oí the Treasuiy, in December last, to invest
the unexpended surplus revenue, mbtate stocks
or does he not remember, that for more than forty
years of the foriv nine, which have elapspd since a
solid foundation v. as laid foi the public credit, the
Chief Justice oí the United States, the VicePresi
dent, Secietary of the Treasury, and Attorney
General, as Commtssioneis of the Sinking Fund
were empowered by law, to purchase daily, m the
money market, evidences of the public debt, which
arose from, loans negotiated in die sane market,
by one of those officers, acting «íththe anproba-
tionof the President"* To the epithet, which my
colleague has applied to those ordimn operations
of every Government, I have onlv to ie,iiy, that an
epithet <snot an argument, though it often conceals
the want of one
Mr Chairman, I believe that confidence at home,
would result from the establishment oí confidence
abroad, and as lemittances to the amount of five
milhons,have raised our depreciated paper currency
to withm five percent of par, the sale of the bonds
of the United States, by creating a toreign credit
of six millions, would raise that currency to par,
m aU the Atlantic, and the greater part of the
Western States It would injure no public interest,
since the Bank of the United States has, for a sim-
llai purpose, offered for sale in the foreign niaiket,
similar securities, having a shorter time to run
Thev are now, as I understand, selling m London,
within two per cent of their nominal par value,
which is six per cent above the real par of ex-
change If objected, that the bonds which we
should offer in the same market, aie each of a very
large amount, let an effort be made, with the as-
sent of the bank, to leduce their sums by increasing
their number
The president and directors of the bank could
have no hesitation in so far aiding the Govern-
ment, to effect a purpose so important to their in-
stitution and to their countiy at large, with whose
prosperity their own is so intimately blended
Such a transfer would not place their bonds in
hands mote unfriendly than those which now hold
them, and the foreign being much lower than the
domestic rate of mteiest, should the bank desire to
prolong their time of payment, such indulgence
could be more readily purchased, and on cheaper
terms, 111 England, than at home
Viewed m eveiy aspect, and I have long con-
templated the measuie Inow urge upon the com-
mittee, I cannot resist the conviction that it would
lead, in a few months, to the restoration of specie
payments by the gieater part of the banks in the
United States , and the moie especially, if it be ac-
companied by the manifestation of a temper, on
the part of Congress and the Executive, friendly
to the banks and the mercantile class of the com-
munity
It does not follow, because a part of those banks
have been impi udently conducted, that their debt-
ors should be punished So far as I have been able
to leain their history, they have been led astray b)
the action of their own Government, they are the
victims of a policy which originated avith the Ex
ecutive, and has been countenanced by Congress
A leading motive to the substitution of the
measure which 1 have labored to recommend, for
the bill on oui table from the Senate, is, that the
layer is part of a system adverse to the curl encv,
the banks, and the country
To sum up the whole of my objections to this
bill, in a few words, it involves a breach of faith
as wanton and reckless in its motives, as it will
prove pernicious 111 its consequences

said deposites ot my parttheieof, 01 may, at hit, discretion
al'ow ihe coins formed at the Mint to be given foi their equiva
lent in money "
(A) Among the causes and remedies of the present embar
rassoienls the repoit enumerates, in the 27th page, ' a foreign
debt meielv commetcul whose balance against us, after all
pioper deductions for heights profits and similat considera
uons, probably exceeded the aggregate of thir y millions of
dolíais '
On the 19th page of the same repoit, the Secietary says, that
' the objection usually urged aaainst an early resumption of
specie pivmeits by the bank", that the tmfavoiable balance of
Irade aga nst this country would in that event, cause some of
the specie m the banks to be drawn out and shipped will, how
ever true in point of fact, possess much less force when it is
cmsilerel thtt thi delay has not prevented the expo t of
specie On the contiaiy considerable sums which were in
ordinal 1/ en cu/atwn, have, since ihe suspension, been with
drawn aad a p >r i n of hem sent abroa 1, wllne their place is
bal'v s ion led with depiec ated papei   '
(i) Ol former sin pluses in the lieasmy, the «euetary ays,
in the 28 It na<*e or his lettei of Septeml er 3 1837, " That sin
plus was of en dep ec ated and the only sound and legal pie
ventives «till appear to this Depar ment to he the measures
befoi e enu net ated for preven ing its accumulation , and after
it had 1 nd<>sj.ine<lly happei ed the wisest disposal of it was
suppose 1 to be 10 ei pend as fast a-, useful, on piaper objecls
of a public charactei, and, in the mean time not to leate it in
th  deposite hank=, but to invest it in State stocks "
Those measutesare pointed out in Mt Woodbury s report of
the 6th of December, 1836, in ihe follow ing language
"Ast e present surplus had chiefly arisen from an earlier
sale of argei poittons of the public lands than had been ex
pected, it seemed to this Department judicious to suggest com
pletiog witn it, sooner than had been contemplated, the project-
ed fortifications and naval establishments of the country, im
proving more rapidly the navigation and security of its com
mercial bays and livers; erecting, where needed, appropriate
cus om and watehouses as well as suitable marine hospitals,
court houses, and post offices "
In the preceding annual leport of the 8th of December, 1835,
speaking on the same subject, Mr Woodbury lays down ttco
general principles, which are suggested as proper to have a
material bearing on the whole subject
"Fir t That whatevet mode may be adopted, it woi Id con
foim tothespuitef the act of Maich, 1817, which has been in
successful operation evei Mnce the u'•pluses became likely to
be large and frequent, and which íequired, before the invest
meat of them m purchase or extingu shmerit of the public
debt, that enough should be Itf m the Treasury tq meet all
outstanding appropriations, and two millions moi e to secuic
facility and ptomptitude m its vanous and distant opetatiotis
'And secondly That, lollowmg the analogy of the abeve act,
which sepaiates he investment of any surplus from pecuniary
profit, entltely from ihe management of ihe public deposites,
ana ihe deposite banks, it would leave the Dank agents of the
Treasuiy as they and alt its othei fiscal agents from the found
an >n of the Government have beeo left, wholly disconnected,
so fai as practicable, in regaul to then agencies with the dan*
getous lelation ol bonoweis from the Tieasury, for reloanmg
and for pi ivale gam "
By the "outstanding appropriations," mentioned in the
first of his two pimciples, Mi Woodbuiy meant, it is piesum
ed as Mr Crawford is known to have done, such outstanding
appioptlations as would l squire disbursements withm the year
Ihe fourth sectionof theact of the3d ofMaich 1819 provided
" 1 hat, after the year 1817, whenevei theie shall be, at any time
after an adjournment of Consress, in any year, a suiplus of
money m the Treasuiy above the sums appropriated for the
semce of such year the payment of which, to the commission
era of the sinking fund, will leave m the Treasury, at the end
of the year, a balayicc equal to two millions of dollars, then
such surplus shall be and the same is hereby, appropriated to
the «ink ng fund, to be paid at «ueh times as the suuation of the
Tieasury will be't permit, and shall be applied by the com
mlssioneis theieof to the payment of the public debt "
The balances m tbe Treasury, afier the end of 1819, was
$2,079 992, and of each of the years 1818 1820 and 1821, was
less than $2 000 000 as it again v. as at the end of 1824 Withm
the eight years of General V\ ashmgton's administration, the bal
anee at the end of the year exceeded a million but twice, and
never reached a million and a quarter
(to To disembanass an aigument aheady overladen with
quotations, ihe following paragiaph from Mr Woodbury's re
poi t of December, lb34, lelauve to the Mint, is here inserted m
anote designed to confiim the views aheady piesented of the
gro s mismanagement of that institution under color of a legal
sanction
" The new coinage has, as yet, been confined principally to
the half and quartet eagles, and has equalled, m all, about
tlnee million one hundí ed and fourteen thousand and ninety
do'la?s,oi in few months more than foul times the annual
average coinage of gold for many years past "
' The demand for other coins has also been promptly met
thi oughout the year To aid m caí rymg the new law into effi
cient operation, this Department, last August, placed in the
hands of the Dnector of the Mint, under the act of April 2,
179¿, twenty thousand dollars, and ten thousand more in Sep
tembei, as it was needed, and could be, withoutinconvenifvce,
spared fiom the Treasury By this couise, many have been
enabled, at once, to realize funds finm th- n deposite of bullion
ol coin, and the Mint to continue its operations unmtimupt
edly, and to supply pro nptly, when desired, coins already
prepai edfor cu culation "
. - is considered proper to invite the attention of Con
^.es* to a thai gt in the law respecting the organization of
ti e Mint establishment so as hereafter to prevent ita operations
11 refining and coining foi others fi om being a tax on the
Treasui y, and any longer swelling the larg e amount of our
aunual expcnili'iu e 1 his could easily be effected by impos
m^ a duty or seignoragc of about one per cent on the prompt
coinage of silvei, and one fourth per cent on that of
gold the pres nt coinage ot copper now defraying its own
expense T is would be no more burdensome to the persons
holding bullion than the delay now allowed for the recomage,
and which delay of forty days, (or one half per cent discount
it dehveied in five day,; and consequent loss of interest, could,
with such a seignoratre, and the advarces now authorized from
tbe Ireasury, be, without inconvenience, reduced to eight or
ten days, and the whole establishment be thus sustained by its
oiirteamings without much if any, increased co6t to either
individuals or the public But in such case if the cost should
evei be inciea^ed to individuals, some additional inducement
will beheld out to jfuevent either the exportation or melting
of eui com which have been so great, before the late change
in the law, as to have ielt m deposite and circulation, m this
country, an amount ot it not exceeding that eti uck m two or
thtee out of the forty years during which the Mint has been
in operation The expenses and labors of the Mint, equalling-,
on an average, about twenty thousand dollars a year, or eight
hundred thousand dol'ars in all, excluding buildings, have thus,
except foi about two yeais, been entirely lost to the country "
Let ihe reader contiast this with the " smallest sum deemed
pi opcr by the Secretary, in his letter of September the 5th,
and the amount of gold comed m the present year by the em
ployment of a million of dollars
