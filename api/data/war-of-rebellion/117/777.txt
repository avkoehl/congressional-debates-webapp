QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Richmond, June 17, 1862.

Honorable G. W. RANDOLPH, Secretary of War.

SIR: A telegram received to-day from Captain McCormick, assistant quartermaster at Lynchburg, states that it is almost impossible to obtain supplies to feed the prisoners of war at that place. I deem it my duty to submit that the difficulty of maintaining prisoners is most serious and that the growing deficiency in the resources of the Confederacy, so far as commissary stores are concerned, will render the speedy exchange of prisoners of war or their disposal otherwise absolutely necessary.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. C. MYERS,

Quartermaster-General.

[First indorsement.]

COMMISSARY-GENERAL:

What has the quartermaster at Lynchburg to do with feeding prisoners? I have reason to expect a speedy exchange and do not wish to incur unnecessary expense in moving the prisoners about.

[G. W. R.]
