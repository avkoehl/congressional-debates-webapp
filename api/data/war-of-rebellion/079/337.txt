Pigeon Mountain. No rebel force had passed WEST from La Fayette, and [there is] a rumor that it had gone east. I do not believe the rebel army has gone WEST of Lookout Mountain, though some cavalry may be threatening Carpenter's Ferry. I think Wagner's DIVISION will be sufficient to take care of that and Bridgeport, at least for the present. I will hold Morgan's here until Colonel Warner arrives.

CHATTANOOGA, October 17, 1864 - 9. 45 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville:

I have just heard from Colonel Watkins, commanding cavalry brigade. He entered La Fayette yesterday about noon. Cheatham's corps left that place about daylight this morning, moving south. He says the whole of Hood's army is this side of Taylor's Ridge, and understood to be going south.

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, TENN., October 17, 1864.

Major General John M. SCHOFIELD,

Chattanooga:

As soon as General Steedman gets his troops adjusted so as to permit Wagner's and Morgan's DIVISIONS being relieved I wish you to take these DIVISIONS and join General Sherman, as he has directed in his dispatch to you. There is a large number of cattle at Chattanooga to go froward to the troops, of which I would like you to take forward to General Sherman as many as you can.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, Commanding.

CHATTANOOGA, October 17, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville:

I have arranged with General Steedman to relieve Wagner in the morning, and will march to-morrow as you direct, taking as many cattle as the troops can take care of. I have not heard from General Sherman since Colonel Warner left him. Scouts report no enemy WEST of Lookout Mountain to-day.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, TENN., October 17, 1864.

Brigadier-General WAGNER,

Bridgeport:

Have your troops and trains ready to move early in the morning. Your whole DIVISION will probably move this way. Give me about daylight your latest information.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
