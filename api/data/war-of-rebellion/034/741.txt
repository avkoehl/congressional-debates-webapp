Was ordered to Lawrenceburg from Indianapolis, and then to report to you. Rebels said to be advancing in force to cut Indianapolis and Cincinnati Railroad at this place. Have been skirmishing with their advance. Am in line of battle. Think it is a small force for the purpose of destroying the railroad. Will come on to Lawrenceburg tonight and await orders there.
