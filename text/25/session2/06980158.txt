Making public officers depositen ies—Mr. Smith.

Senate.
Uon of these bounties, but are obliged to pav then
neighbor bankers, not more mentones, and pei-
haps not as much so as themselves, for their credit,
loaned to them in the shape of paper money, manu-
factured at their pleasure, and obliged to submit,
many times, to the most degrading humiliation,
even to persuade the banks so far to condescend to
aid them, as to loan them their credit, by giving the
most ample and undoubted security.
And, said JVJCr. S if a bank made a depository
of the public money fails—and it is now quite a
common occurrence—whether it be through disho-
nesty, oi unwarranted Iward and speculation,
what remedy has the Government except upon the
bond taken lor the repayment of the money? And
no person will often become surety, but such a-, are
connected with the bank, and when tint fails, they
fail also; the surety may apparently be ample when
taken, and entirely worthless when the failure
takes place. The Government can institute no in-
quiry into the conduct of the bank man ígers, it has
no power to call them to account, and howevei
great the fraud, and howevei great the loss, the
Government has no remedy except on the bond, oi
by some civil action Conscious of the impe in-lia-
ble shield afforded them, is not obliquity almost v
sure consequence? And, il Icist, an, they not much
moie likely to he guilty nt I uid than the public
ofheer, who has not only his nonoi it stake, and
that of his family, but is civilly liable to the lull
extent of his present pioperty, and also to all fm-
ther acquisitions and is also liable criminal!), and
to be separated from his family, and all tint is
deal and valuable m this hit, and lo become tin.
mtimateof thieves, robbers, and all the outcasts and
hopeless depreditors upon the lights of man The
Government not only sustains ihe peeumary loss,
without the means o( repining it, but Me puniie
sustains infinitely gieater injtiiies, by uidire'iily be-
coming the mstimnent of piopigating, engcnlir-
mg, and inflicting crime upon the community, an 1
which fills every social interstice with its bilcful
effects
Much pains lias b<en liken to ptejndice tht peo-

and how does this irctiih upi n the lights of the

The States alone have powet to continue flieni,
discontinue them, or new organize them, a? ihey
may find it foi their interest to do, unless the h inks
have become an independent e'tale, and are be y ond
the reach of the Government which cr< ued them
And why should the binks complain of this? Have
they any moie n^ at to demand of the Government
its countenance and supp nt, thin hue individuals
who aie not incoipouted' If they hive, upon

to pay all just demands upon them If the Go.crn
ment goes to war, the individual comes to its ant
they go into the field and fight the battles, thej pro-
duce the wealth,pay the taxes, and enrich the coun
try And will any one claim that if every man was
his own banker,  and issued  bills at his pleasure,
and when he found it for his interest, that the Go-
vernment ought to mike them depositaries of its
monev, and íeceive all their bills or notes in pay-
ment of the public dues' Mr S said the officers
ot the Government formerly received, kept, and
paid out the public money with quite as little loss
as has occuned since banks became fiscal agen Is of
the Government Previous to the rtcharten ng ol
the United States Ban >. in 181G, the gieatest partof
the public revenue \ is collected, kept, -md paid
out by the officers of the Government And what
makes them more degenei ated and less capable
now' Has the influence of the banks made them
degeneiate, or what is it to be attributed to? Or is
it to be found onl> in the imagination of the
bankets, w hose cupidity has been sh upened by the
lnoulinate inteiest they have iccemed by means of
the public deposites
The Opposition have been more clamoions upon
the subject ol exchanges, than almost any thing
else Commeire, they said, must wholly fail, mi*
less Government made some pio\ ision to aid the
merchants in exe hanges Nothing would legulate
them, they said, but a bank, or banks, and there-
lore Govermmnt was bound to take the banks

the Senitei, undpr such unnaturil regulations,
wouid be much meire imperfect than he now is
If in making seimes long speech, hi" functionar es
•-hould neglect their duty, or rathei ¡.ervice, or by
icason of an advers* interest they might have,
ihou4d neglect to supply him with the life-sustain-
ing fluitl, his speech would be cut short, ana he
would be obliged to ait down in the midst of if; awl
why? because his hfe-bood was at the coateol of
others, to whose interest or will he was compelled
to conform. Mr S said, if this be a fair compari-
son, it is not difficult to see that the nation, Without
the control of its life-blood, would be as impotent
and powerless as the man who should be depen-
dent on others for his blood.
What act would tend more directly to consoli-
date the Union, and break down thee independence
ol the States, than the system of State banking, if
the State Governments and General Government
were compelled to have a mutual dependance on
each other in their banking operations; moved by
a self-acting machine, which would pervade every
part of community, and would he interwoven with
every interest, whether it be in individual transac-
tions, or the concerns of the State or General Go-
vernment1 No scheme was ever devised, in his
opinion, which was so well calculated to corrupt
and demoralize the people, and subject them to the
entire control of the anstocracy of the country, not
only the wealth of our country, but the concen-
trated and united wealth will be directly wielded,
as an irresistible power, to control the people in all
our elections What class of men, or what indi-
viduals, aie theie m community, who will not, to
a veiy consideiable extent, be subject to their con-
trol? The banks thus fortified, by the aid
and support of the State Governments, and gua-
íantieel by the General Government, will be vest-
ed with the power of concreting and secreting the
life-blood of the body politic both of the State and
General Governments They can produce a ple-
thora at their ploasuie and will, and by that means
pataly/e and ilústrate the fuactionsof the Govern-
ment , eir they can, at their pleasure, as their inte-
rest, politic il desires., or caprice mty dictate, cause
i eh[>lelion, and lints inn down and prostrate the
poweis of the Government The great body oi
ihe people will be made to feel, directly or mdi-
leelly, tins gigantic power, placed in the hands of
that class of people pointed out in the letter of
A'exatider Hamilton to Mr Jefferson, before al-
luded to, (the wealthy,) as bsmg the only firm sup-
porters oí Government, wherein he shows his pre-
ference for a monaiclncal Government, and thj
federal party have ever since followed hi his foot-
steps, and which they have indicated a resolute
determination in build up and ¡support Not only
the people, m their individual capacity, and m
their oidmary transactions, will be subject to the
control of these soulless and bodiless creatures, but
the Government*, both State and General, will be
wholly at their mercy, and may be disposed of at
their pleasure It is always said that money is
the smew of war, and that it cannot be earned on
without it it this is so, it will be quite easy to see
what condition the ooantry would be in, in case of
a war, by recurring to ihe conduct of the Federal
party during the last war with Great Britain, and
ninety-five in a hundred of the banks aie now in
the haneis and under the contiol of the same party,
anel probably will remain so
Mr S said that we may see the peculiar charac-
te i of the patuotism of ihe Feeleral party, so much
hoisied of, am! how ieaely they are to manifest it
' by being always at tin ir post in the hour of dan-
ger," when the country is i ívaded by a public
enemy He would read an extract or two from
their publications during that war, when the coun-
try was compelled to draw upon all its resources to
save its melepenrlence, which is a fair specimen ot
their pitrio'ism at this time, as well as then Ex-
ttaet from a R iston paper "Let no man, who
wishes to continue th" war by actne means, by
vo e oi lending money, dare to prostiate himself at
the ilnr on tne fast day, for they are ac ually as
much partakers m the war as the soldier who
thrusts the bayonet, and the judgment of God will
await them " Extracts from the Boston Gazette,
Apr I 14, 1814 "Will Federalists subscribe to
the loan? Will they lend money to our national
rulei s It is impossible ■ first, because of principle;
and, secondly, because of principal and interest. Il
they lend money now, they make themselves parties
to the violation of the Constitution, the cruelly op-
pressive measures m relation to commerce, and to
