ported it AH this could be learned from these
documenta if they ever saw the light We had
a salt tax of about twenty cents a bushel m
1797-98, when we had a Federal Administration,
a standing army, and the alien and sedition law,
but when Mi Jeffeison came into office, he rec-
ommended that the salt tax «should be " sup-
pressed," using the term that is applied to vice
Mr B then read the law repealing that tax, which
he said he should make the model of the bill he
was about to inti aduce
When this tax was put on again, it was put on
as a war tax, and he well remembered the saying
of the venerable Nathaniel Macon, which was
characteristic of the man, that though it went on
as a wai tax, it would be hard to get it off as a
peace tax Mi B said he proposed to offer for
the consideiation of the Senile a bill which would
be a copy of the one just read, and heie (he said)
we can nut one finger on the lunge on which the
whole question turns It was the fishing bounties
on which the salt duty íested, and which had
kept it in existence to this day He now gave
notice to the Senator from Massachusetts, [Mi
Davis,] that he would bring up this question, and
then enable the gentleman to maintain the posi-
tion he had taken by him this day, and he might
prepare himself for an answer Before a man
can get this fishing bounty fiom the Trcasuiy, he
must take an oath that he has paid in equivalent
on the salt duty, and it was beciuse these fishing
bounties would have nothing upon eatth to stand
on, after the duty is repealed, that such gieat op-
position is made to so just and necessary a meas
ure Yet, sir, while the South and West is not
only taxed, but the whole business is thrown into
the hands of the regrateis to extort what they
& lease, and stint the countiy, the people of the
fortheast make money out of it Mi B heie
madevanous statements to prove that the coun-
try was stinted in the article of salt, and referíed
to the fact thit the pork market at Cincinnati
opened at $6 50, and fell to $4 50 m consequence
of the want of salt to cure it, and this, too, while
pork at New Orleans was selling at twenty seven
dollars
Mi MORRIS said that, in accordance with the
suggestion, he was willing to withdraw the mo-
tion to rescind, with a view to the oidei being
reconsideied, and the subject íeferred to the ap-
propriate committee He would remails that he
thought the Senator fiom Missoun was in staiten
in the cause to which he attiibuti d the depiession
of the price of pork in theCmc nniti mirktt He
had never heard in that section of the country
that the tax on salt was considered oneious
The price of pork had fallen, not inconsequence
of the salt tax, but punupally on account of the
exertions of the fuends of a sou id currencj ,
among whom the Senator from Missouri boie so
conspicuous a part It was the substitution of a
sound and healthy cuntncy in place ot the ex-
parded paper system which hid led to the fall of
puces The farmers do not like papei, and they
are now getting something like money for their
produce This was the reason and foi tlieeffoits
of the Senator on that occisión, ind his agency
in bringing about this state of things, he has my
most hearty thanks He concluded by laying he
would withdraw the motion to lescmd.if he had
the unanimous consent of the Senate to do so
Mi CLA! , of Kentucky, objecte 1 ind as the
motion could not be withdiawu but by unanimous
consent, the question on it was taken, and decided
in the affii mauve—jeas 23, n lys 35
After the consideiation of eKfeutive business,
the Senate adjourned till Wednesday
To the Reporters foi the Mohe
Gemlf-kis, Statistical statements, m de m debite ire
difficult lo tit reported with iccuracv and therefor it v  la
east !or set eral errors to creep into your report of inv re
mirks on the «alt duties a few days a„o I here correct
s >me of them is bem,, materia* to the sense of what i slid,
m 1 11 at old g i nig ( rroneous i uoimation
1 \  to the t u uuitv oí salt imported into the United
State  the report represents me a  saying ten million
bushels, when jt should be live to six million, and about
the banie quantity made at home, so that the whole supply
of the Union wis ten or eleven million bushels, the whole
of which would be needed for our twenty million sheep, if
salted as the English sheep are
2   As to the prices to which salt had risen, on some oe
casions, in Missouri the report says, three dollars for fifty
pounds weight, which fifty pounds weight might be put into
a half bushel measure T his is correct, hut it required cir
cumotantiahty as to time and place, to wit that it occurred
in November last, and about one hundred and fifty miles
above St Louis
3   Aa to the price of salt in Louisville, as I came on to
Congress this fall the reportiscrihes me'fl "íOas the price,
it should be one dollar, with the qualification of being easily
put into a half bushel measure
4   The report speaks of the putrescent, bitter, and poi
sonous ingredients, which remain more or less in ill salt
made by the boiling process m eonti idistmction to the nit
ural crystahzing proees undt r solar evaporation This is all
right only bitter should be bittern
5   As to the amount of the fishing bounties and allow
anees the report ascribes to me the sum ol half a million
per annum as their probable amount, it should be a quarter
of a million
6   As to the duty on salt in England when it was abol
ished In Parliament the report <=avs sixpence a bushel, it
should be thuteen shillings and sixpence
7   As to the price of mc«s pork in New Orleans and pork
falling in the northwest, while rising m the market to which
it was to be sent the report says the market m Ohio opened
at $6 50 and fell to $4 SO per hundred, while mess pork in
New Orleans rose to $20 a barrel, and ihis becausp of the
scarceness and dearness of salt Tfirs is all right, except
that mess pork ro e to fg27 a barrel in New Orleans
Yours, respectfully,           THOMAS H  BENTON
