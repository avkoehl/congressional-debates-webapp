it. Shall it move at once? There is distant artillery firing in front, and to my right of Reams' Station I should think. Of course, I abandon my line on moving.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 29, 1864-12.15 p.m.

Major-General WRIGHT,Commanding Sixth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you send a division to Ream's Station at once to support General Wilson. You will follow and support this division with your whole corps. General Gibbon is ordered to take the left of the Second Corps at once. General Sheridan is now moving up from Fort Powhatan to the crossing of Warwick Swamp by the plank road, and an officer has been sent to direct him to move as rapidly as possible to Reams' Station. He is advised that you will send a division there and follow it up with your corps. Colonel Bryan should be directed to throw out a force toward Reams' Station at once, in connection [with] the movement of your division, and to communicate with Wilson and with these headquarters. Impress upon him the necessity of prompt, frequent, and speedy communication with yourself and these headquarters.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 29, 1864-12.30 p.m.

Major-General WRIGHT,Commanding Sixth Corps:

As General Gibbon will draw in his pickets from your left over to Blackwater Swamp, and as the pickets of your left will be drawn in before the Second Corps can replace them - if, indeed, they can replace those of your left at all - Colonel Bryan should replace your pickets and extend across as well as down the plank road. I will send to join Colonel Bryan all the cavalry we can get here.

The commanding general directs that you leave your pickets out, as you will return as soon as Wilson is relieved. The plank road should be well picketed with cavalry.
