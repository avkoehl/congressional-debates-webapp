General HOOKER:

All dispatches to Sedgwick been delivered. Last ones just run to him for life. He is on Sumner's old battle-ground, held in check apparently. Advised me at 8 o'clock that he would form column of attack and push. Gibbon is with him. I have pushed him all that I felt justified.

General SEDGWICK:

I am just advised by Ingalls, date United States Ford, 8.45:

Terrible conflict; enemy in great force in their front and right, but at that moment they were repulsing him and driving on all sides.

General Hooker is safe, so far. Ingalls says we shall be victorious. What from your column of attack?

Another dispatch from General Hooker:

Communicate with Sedgwick. We are driving the enemy, and only need him to complete the job.

Hastily, yours,BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

Please acknowledge above, and date and hour.

MAY 3, 1863-10.15 a.m.

General BUTTERFIELD:

Your two dispatches received. There is no cavalry here for patrol duty, and the men at the telegraph station are worn out by constant patrolling. The communication again open to United States Ford. From appearances, our troops are gradually pushing this way.
