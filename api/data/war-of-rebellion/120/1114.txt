FRANKFORT, KY., November 9, 1864.

His Excellency A. LINCOLN, President of the United States:

General John B. Houston, a loyal man and prominent citizen, was arrested and yesterday started off by General Burbridge to be sent beyond our lines by way of Catlettsburg for no other offense than opposition to your re-election. Stay the hand of this second Paine and save your Administration the odium and your country the shame of such iniquities. You are doubtless re-elected, but surely it cannot sanction this ostracizing of loyal men who honestly opposed you.

After getting them all ready at the depot we were notified by telegraph not to send them and had to take them back to the stockade. Many of these poor fellows, already broken down in health, will succumb through despair.
