JNO. WITHERS,Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS LEE'S CAVALRY DIVISION,

ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,

August 23, 1864 - 2.30 p. m.

Colonel SORREL:

COLONEL: Advance of enemy reported by Lomax turned out to be a small reconnoitering party, who have gone back. Lomax's scouts report no enemy this side of Shepherdstown. Will encamp on Smithfield pike near Cameron's Depot, in supporting distance of either flank. General Early has desired me to take charge of all the cavalry whilst General A[nderson] and he are together. There is no doubt most of enemy's cavalry are on their right flank.

Very respectfully,

FITZ LEE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS VALLEY DISTRICT,August 24, 1864.

General BRECKINRIDGE:

GENERAL: As the enemy is reported advancing on Gordon's left and front, General Early directs that you move Gordon to meet them, and Wharton to support him, except the brigade which is watching the trains.

I am, general, respectfully, & c.,

A. S. PENDLETON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

AUGUST 24, 1864 - 7.15 a. m.

Lieutenant-General EARLY:

GENERAL: I have Terry's brigade in line between Shepherdstown and Leetown road, with remainder of Gordon's command and Wharton just behind, waiting developments. Lomax is on Shepherdstown road, and I have a picket on Leetown road. I don't hear anything of the enemy, and believe it was another cavalry stampede. I learn that Lomax has sent McCausland out to hunt for the enemy.

Respectfully,

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General.
