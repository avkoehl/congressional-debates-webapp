1863, to repel the invasion of the State by the rebels under Morgan, I beg leave to report that there have been received and audited, and ordered paid by the Governor, to date, 587 company pay-rolls and 216 separate individual accounts for militia service, showing an aggregate of 49,357 men paid, and a sum total of $212,318.97. The number that reported for duty each county, so far as the accounts have been rendered, together with the aggregate amount paid to each county is exhibited in the following tabular statement, by counties, of the number of militia in service during the Morgan raid, and the amount paid the same:

In addition to the foregoing, you should be advised that many companies that responded promptly and performed efficient service for from one five days have return-rolls, and declined payment for the service rendered in defense of their own homes. Still others have never made out rolls of pay, generously donating their services to the State. The entire militia force of Harrison County through Mr. [S. B.] Shotwell, secretary of the military committee, unanimously declined payment for the very important service they rendered. There are, however, rolls, outstanding that have been returned on account of some defects. I have information of about seventy companies that have reported for pay, most of which will be ultimately paid. They will increase the number paid to upward of 55,000 men, and add $20,000 to the sum total.

The returns received from the militia ordered out on the 11th of November for the defense of Johnson's Island, are too incomplete for anything more than the general statement that it is believed $10,000 will pay for the service.

All of which is respectfully submitted.

HENRY S. BABBITT,

Auditing Officer of Morgan Raid Claims for the State of Ohio.
