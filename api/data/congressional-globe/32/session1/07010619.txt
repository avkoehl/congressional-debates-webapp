MEXICAN CLAIMS.
Mr. MASON. I am instructed by the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, to ask that that com-
mittee may be discharged from the further con-
sideration of a number of petitions which I hold
in my hand, addressed to the Senate, praying an
examination or inquiry into the manner in which
the claims against Mexico were examined and
treated under the late commission which sat under i
the Mexican treaty. If the Senate will indulge me j
for a moment, I will state that the petitioners ask I
that the committee, to which were referred these
memorials, may have power to prosecute their in-
quiries by sending for persons and papers. The
Committee on Foreign Relations, however, have
considered it impracticable to conduct their inqui-
ries in this mode, and, on consulting with gentle-
men connected with these matters, it seems to be
acceptable to them that the subject should be re-
ferred to a select committee. The Senator from
Louisiana [Mr. Downs] proposed such a refer-
ence. He is not now present; and unless some
other gentleman is disposed to move that they be
referred to a select committee, I will ask that the
Committee on Foreign Relations be discharged
from the further consideration of these memorials,
and move that, for the present, they may be laid
upon the table.
The committee was accordingly discharged from
their further consideration, and it was ordered
that these memorials be laid upon the table.

ELECTORAL VOTES.
Mr. BORLAND by unanimous consent, asked
and obtained leave to introduce a joint resolution;
which was read, as follows:
Joint Resolution in relation to the number of electoral
vutes each, State uill be entitled to in the presidential
election qf 18o2.
Be it resolved, fyc., That the number of electoral votes
to which each State shall be entitled in the election of Pres-
ident and Vice Prudent of the United States in 1802, >hall
be equal to the nwtnher of Senators and Representatives to
which each of v<md States will be found entitled by the ap-
poiuomnent under the enumeration of 1*50, as provided by
the act tor "taking the Seventh, and subsequent Ce -
( suses," approved May23, 1850.
j The resolution, on the motion of Mr. Borland,
i was lead a second time, with a view to reference.
| Mr. BORLAND. If it be in order, Mr. Presi-
: dent, I will remark, for a moment, upon the char-
; acter and object of the resolution, before 1 move
| its reference.
We have printed, and upon our desks this morn-
ing, a communication from the President of the
United States, laying before us a report from the
Secretary of the Interior, showing why he has
been unable to perform the duty of making the ap-
portionment of Representatives upon the basis of
the new enumeration, as required by the act of
May 23, 1850; the reason stated being the defec-
tive returns from the State of California. This
communication has been referred to the Commit-
tee on the Judiciary. In connection with it, and
as a part of the action of the committee and of the
Senate in regard to the questions it raises, and
requires'to be settled, I think the declaration con-
tained m this resolution is most importantâ€”neces-
sary, indeed, on account of peculiar circumstances
to enable the people of the several States to exer-
; cise the elective franchise in the ensuing presiden-
! tial election.
| I have hesitated to bring this question before
| the Senate, and should not have done so'but for
j the magnitude of its interest to all the States, and
j particularly to the State I have been sent here to
J represent; and further, for finding that opposite
! opinions on the subject are entertained alike
throughout the country, as indicated by the news-
paper press, and among the members of this body.
For myself, I have held from the first but one
opinion; but as I am always disposed to distrust
somewhat my own opinions, especially upon ques-
tions like this, when I find them not concurred in
by gentlemen whose capacity to judge of such
questions I greatly respect, and concede to be, in
general, greatly superior to my own, I desire this
difference of opinion to be decided by the authori-
tative action of Congress.
In my own opinionâ€”which with some diffi-
dence I submit to the Senateâ€”the Constitution,
the act of 1792, and the census act of 1850, taken
together, clearly and certainly establish the posi-
tion assumed in my resolution, that the number of
electoral votes which each State will be entitled
to give in the ensuing presidential election, will be
the number of Senators and Representatives to
which it will be entitled by apportionment under
the recent enumeration; that is, that the election
will be held and the votes given upon the basis of
the census of 1850, and not that of 1840. In sup-
port of this opinion I refer to the Constitution, and
the legislation under it on this subject. Providing
for the census, or enumeration of the people, the
Constitution prescribes:
" The actual enumeration shall be made within three
years after the fir^t meeting of tiie Congress of the United
States, and witnm every subsequent term of ten years, in
such manner as they shall by law direct."â€”Const. U. S.j
art. 1, sec. 2.
Until the first actual enumeration, the number
