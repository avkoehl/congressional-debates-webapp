THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Jan. 31,
rence, and,SJ,pn account of the appropriation
which formed the subject matter of the obnoxious
alteration Legislation should be simple: straight
forward, and according to rule Theie were laws
laid down for the pioceedmgsof legislation—rules
which were founded on reason, and any mode of
legislation which violates those ules must violate
the reasons on which they ate founded.
Both Houses had legislated so badly on this
subject that they had now reduced themselves to I
the predicament of being compel'ed to choose
between two evils The basis of liberty and éffi
ciency in legislation is, that the members of the
Legislature should have the light of fieedom of
debate, and the right auxiliary of ¡ejecting or
adopting any amendment which might m any
manner 01 by any person be proposed Yet by
the proceedings of the conference, the House was
completely piecluded fiom the power of noticing
the a nendment, without reacting the whole bul,
aiid weie ilebaned the fieedom of debate on the
subject
^sain with iegard to the appropriation made
of §5 000 by the compromise, he does not so much
consider the amount of that sum as the principle
on which it had been foisted into the bill. An
appropiiation for any, ihe most extianeous pur-
pose, might have similaily been intioduced—one
(for i istance) for dealing all the nveis of the
country, oi ineieising all the salaries, which he
informs us is contemplated, of the executive offi-
ceisof the Government lie would object equally
to one dulliti so appropuated as to one million A
small sum should not thu3 be stolen no more than
a large Important consequences often result fiom
sma'l beginnings No one(asMi Chytom lllus
tiated h s posi ion) can succeed in hits attempts at
i eduction, if theie have not been compliances
gianted to him
In conclusion, he said that it would be bettei to
reject the bill than to pass it with such an ol jec
uonable amendment as that lepoited by the com-
mit ee, even at the risk of having the appropua-
tions defeired He expected the House would
ultimately be obliged to act as had been done in j
the ca^e lepoited by Mamnus Scnbleius—begin
all its pro< eeilings de now
Mr SUlIIERLANDconsidercditrlu'iculousto
advocate a i ig d adherence to parliamentary usage,
else would this countiy sanction a painted cham-
bo , ik ft r good to depend on rules founded
on leason But the reasons which may sanction
rules foi one Legislate may not be «Iculated to
found rules foi a Legislature of a different coun-
try lie is moie solicitous to fíame rules legu
lating the legislative pioctedings of this countiy,
fiom reasons more immediately affecting the in
teiests and customs of the countiy, rathei than
fiom any foreign reasons', howevei appropriate
they might have been to institute the rules foi
other pioccedings
Mi  S cited son e cases from the English Par-
liament, in the íeign of Elizabeth, and one fiom
the Legislature of IVnnsyl/ama, to show.occoid
ing to the piactice theie, that the power to add
new sections, to bills was given to their committees [
ot conference.    These committees, if he might be
allowed the teim, possessed the majesty of both
Houses, and they weie often resoited to as mea 
ures of expediency, to prevent, as was the case in
this instance, the loss of abi'lupon which the two I
Houses might have diffeied     He fully concurred i
in the opinion expressed by the Speaker, that the
present quesuo  was not strictly one so much of
oider as it wa" of discretion, and which it was
for the House to sanction or not, as it thought
proper
Mr II \R.D!N contended that it was not con-
sistent with the dictates of common sense to sup-
pose that i committee of confeience could right
fu'ly originate any new clause to a bill
Mi FOLK expressed his regret that this ques-
t on had been—instead of being discussed on its
ments—-embatrassed with so many points of order.
However, as an opinion on these points had been
given by the Speakei, it was unnecessary for him
now to entertain them He justified the commit-
tee fir havi ig recommended the piopcsiuon, as
it v, is ma'e by them, with a sincere desne on
the s past to Futile the differences which existed
bcatei ti e House , and which might have caused
the io s of tne entire bilí     Tins was done m
good feeling; but as their acts were not binding,
it was for the House to decide whether their rec-
ommendation was to be cairied into effect They
had considered all the circumstances connected
with the question, and he entreated the House
would now decide it fairly upon its merits, as if
any defect should be found to exist hereafter, it
could be provided for by another bill, which was
better than to have the present bill lost.
Mr J ft ADAMS requested the title of the
bill should be read
The title was read accordingly.
Mr A then called for the reading of the entire
bill, which being also read, he insisted tuat the
insertion of the clause íecommended by the com-
mittee was' in total variance with the tule of the
bill, which was an act making appropiiation for
the seivice of Government, in part, foi 1834, and
he asked what possible connexion was theie to
wairant such a proposition as a library subscrip-
tion in a bill of this character'
Mr POLK remarked, that if the honoiable
member examined the bill he would find that the
pioposition was f irly connected with the clause,
making a limitation to the puichase of books,
&c
Mr ADAMS would alsocontend that even that
clause ought not to have been in the bill, as it was
inconsistent with its title. The piesent question
was one not only of oidei, but one that involved
the principle of legislation, consistency, and the
very honorof Congress, which was bound to main-
tain, when it passed any bills, that there should
be some connexion between the t.'lecf the bill and
Us piovisiors If the worst came to the worst,
that the House adhered to then ongu al intention,
by wh'ch the presenf bill would be lost, anothei
could beiejjorted in thegeneral appropiiation bill,
«id this he believed would hasten, not retard, their
measures
After a few brief remarks fiom Messrs E

BARD, VVAY¡S¡C, BATES, LANE, and FOOT,
i and aiter two ineflectual motions foi adjournment,
the question on concurung with the vote of the
Committee of the Whole on their agieement to the
pioposition made bythe committee of confeience,
was put, and decided in the negative

heretofore refused to recede, it was not in oider to
renew it
Mr BEARDSLEY rose and moved an adjourn-
ment, which prevailed
And the House adjourned
