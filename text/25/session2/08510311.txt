25th Covg — 2nd Stbs.                                            Resurrection Notes—Mr. Roane.                                                                   Senate.
would not it this late hour, and protracted stage of
the debate, trespass on their time and patience
But, having formed a very decided opinion in fa-
vor of the measure under consideration, and con-
cluded, only a few moments since, that it was per-
haps ray duty to say some hmg, I rise thus unex-
pectedly to assign, in such language as the occasion
may prompt, the reasons which control the vote
I shall give
Mr President, I have ever been a strict con-
structionist of constitutions—most especially of our
limited Federal Constitution—so much so, as to
have opposed measures merely because T thought
them unconsti'utional Nay, sir, I have ever ac-
knowledged the justice, and felt the force, of the ex
cellent rule just adverted to by the Senator irom
Tennessee, [Mr White] that it is best not to vote
for a measure when the mind entertains even a
doubt oí the constitutional power to pass it I hope
I shall ever abide by this safe and sound rale
Entertaining these sentiments, the very first mo-
ment that the sound fell upon my ear, that there
were constitutional difficulties in the way of this
bill—that the Congress of the United States does
not possess the power to arrest this outrageous
fraud, perpetrated under tne cloak, but in reality,
in defiance of a law it had passed—I was struck
wuh astonishment, and at once resolved to review,
calml/ and dispassionately, the opinion I had form-
ed I have done so I have listened, not only
with a profound and anxious attention, but with a
jealous vigilance, to every word and argument
used to establish the proposition, an 1, sir, I must
be permitted to «.ay, that s > far from being convinc-
ed that there is any sjch constitutional impediment,
I have not been able to find even " a loop or hinge
to hang a doubt upon" as to the right
Sil, I voted ag<i list the passage of the law incor-
porating the ¡ate Bank of the United States I am
one of the few members of either House of the
present Congress who voted against that law, and,
perhaps, the only one who voted against it on con-
stitutional grounds I then thought, as I now think,
that Congress had no power whatever, either ex-
press or nnpliel, in the Constitution, to pass such
a Ian But, sir, when I voted against that law
because I thongnt it unconstitutional, I little
dreamed that w h n the twenty years within wmch
the operations of the Bank it created were limited,
should have rolled around, we were then lo be told
tnat it is uneons tutio tal to compel it to wind up
its concerns that we should then hear it pro-
claimed, on the floor of either House of Congiess,
that the immense amount of paper money which
that Bank was thereby authorised to issue and
keep in circuhtion 'or twenty jtars only, might,
by any conceit able mimgement, tuck, or finesse,
be kept in oire ílation foi an indefinite period of
time
What, Mr Pres dent, is m°ant—what do we un-
derstand—« hen vv e speak of " w mding up a con-
cern'" Is it not, let me ask.of the very essence ot w md-
mgf up the affairs , or concerns of a bank, that it should
collect and pay if  debts, and, abo/e all things,
draw in and cancel its promissory notes'! Has
the late Bank of the United States, or its agents,
or trustees, 0r executors, it you choose the term,
done this? Have they attempted to do it, or any
thing like if* On the contrary, have they not
done exictly the reveise, in direct and known vio-
lation of the law which gave it existence1 Have
they not at this moment out, and in circulation
among the people, millions of the identical notes,
struck by the plates of the late Bank of the Ijnited
States, signed by its officers, and issued by the au-
thority of its legitimate directors, acting under a
law of Congress' None deny these facts, and none
deny the miqu 'y of the transaction,} et are wegrav e-
ly told, that Congress has no power to arrest the
progress of the evil, for ooth—because the bank
is dead—-because its charter has expired' And,
su, we--houidbe told by these same gentlemen that
neither the State of Pennsylvania, or any other
State of this Union, has the powei to arrest it
Does not erery person know that those who took
posspssion of the notes of the late Bank of the United
Slat' , on the expiration of its charter, became its
trustees or repiesenlitives, to wind up its concerns,
and as such, were responsible for their faithful con-
duct to the law under which they were ap-
pointed, and under which the bank w nose con-
cerns they were deputed to close, lived and
d ed' When Congress, sir, incorporated the
late Bank of the United States, they acted but as
trustees or agents of the people, and, as such, made
for and in behalf of them two pledges—one was to
the company thus incorporated, to guarantee to
them, so long as they complied with the provisions
of their charter, all the privileges and immunities
it conferred upon them The oiher was to 'he peo-
ple, that after the term of twenty years had elapsed,
all those exclusive privileges and immunities «should
cease, and the vast amour-t of paper money issued
by the bank, should be withdrawn from circula
tion, unless tney, the people, should choose to re-
vive and extend its charter The people have not
so chosen But the first pledge has been fully re-
deemed They have submitted most quietly to the
en'ire fulfilment of the law, and the bank has been
secured by the judiciary department, whenever it
was necessary, in the full enjoyment of all its legal
rights Has the second pledge been redeemed'
Has the paper money put in circu'ation by it or its
representatives m pursuance of a law of Congress,
been withdrawn and cancelled in pursuance of the
same law' No, is the ready and undeniable an-
swer from every lip. Yet are we told that outra-
geous as is this proceeding, m defiance or aosence
of law, Congress has no power whatever to inter-
fere' That, gross and palpable as is the fraud,
Congress cannot euher prevent it or punish its
perpetiators' Who I ask m the name of com-
mon sense, and cimmon justice, and common
honest) , can punish it, if Congress cannot' If it
be an offence at all, it must be an offence against
law, or within the reach of law, and ad
will ddmi1 thii it is not an offence against a I w c 1
any State of this Confederacy on ?n) fjre gn
nation Were not these notes ong nally ísued o y
authority of a Ian of Congress, and are they n t
continued in circulation in the teeth of a plai i yn
visien of that same law, wh ch,I conten!, is m fu'l
force so long as one single o«ie of them is permit
ted U perform the functions of a circulating me
dium
I am asked, Mr President, to put my finger on
the clause in the Constitution which grants the
power sought to be exercised by the bill on jour
table? I in return ask those who can put their fin-
ger on the ciause in the Constitution wh ch giatls
the power to establtsh aNattonal Bank, to show me
the clause which withholds the power to limit its
charter, or, when it has expired, to wind up its
affairs' Surelv, sir, it is most unreasonab'e to
require thjse who deny any power vvni'ever in the
Constitution to establish a Na'ional Bank, to show
a clause in that instrument which giants the poner
to compel a National Bank to wind up us con
cerns' The honoiable Senator In m Tennessee,
[Mr Whitf] has truly told us that those who
claim the powei to establish a Na'ional B pk, hive
rambled through all the mazes of the Constitution, I
and have located their right, simetimes m one, and
sometimes in another of its c au'e-., until it had
been called, not unaptly, a vagrant power Call
it, sir, b> whit name you will, a "vagrant," or I
even a "squatter," it affords bo reason to m" to i
grant it a "pre-emption right "                                  j
Mr Pres dent, I pretend not to show an\   clause i
in the Constitution which gran's the  speafie  tung |
contemplated by the bill on j oui table     1 am free ,
to sai, that I do not derive the power to pass that j
bill from inv hteial clause, or specific grant, m the |
Constitution       I, who detiv th° right ot  Congress
to piss mepe viable laws, and contend for its power
to a'iei, am nd, repeal, or enfoicc, the laws it dies
pass, am it no loss for ponei to pass tne 'nil under
consKkis'ion, it goes with, antis i  pirt o1"  the I
powei of legislatioi granfd to Cong'essbv the Son- |
st tution       It is   iftheveij  iss'nee c   legislation
that i vice o« mis h ef growing  out   it  cue  law,
should be ibated or punished bv ant ther liv, that I
where one livv his tpentd a doortoi tnu i, another j
law should shut it     I contend, sir that every pait
and parcel of the bank law of 1810 which has not j
been fu'fdh ¡, oi itpea'ed, is now in  lull   toice and
effect, and I further contend, thU th?' section of it
which provides that the bank  it treated should|
within two ye^rs after the period of its limitation,
wind up its concerns, has neither been repealed nor
complied with, and is therefore m force, and that
if further legislation is necessary to compel a com-
pliance with its provisions, it is not only (he right,
but the duly, of Congress to afford it. That bask
was allowed two year* to wind up its conceros and
close its business If, instead of closing them in
one day, as they pretended to do, they had gone on
tn good faith to draw in and cancel all its
outstanding notes, and had been unable to
perform the duty within the time limited,
does any person doubt the power of Congress
to have extended the time' Why, then, when
they have acted nelortovsly with bad faith,
and have permitted the two years to run out
wi hout an effort, and, as is now apparent, without
the slightest intention, to withdraw its notes from
circulation, can not Congress compel them to com-
ply with their engagements, audpunish them for a
continuance of such open and flagrant violation of
law and duty?
But, Mr President, we are told, in answer to
every objection to a conanuance of this fraud, that
it is not the late Bank of the United States char-
tered by Congress, but the n'w Bank of the United
States chartered by the State of Pennsylvania, that
perpetrates it It is, sir, an unwarrantable imputa-
tion on the vigilance and fidelity of the constituted
authorities of Pennsylvania, to suppose for a mo-
ment that such can be the fact. The Bank of the
United States chanered by that State, is expressly
prohibited from issuing notes of a less denomination
than ten dollars, under pain of an immediate for-
feiture of its charter Most of the millions of the
paper of the late Bank of the United States now m
circulation are notes office dollars, and I therefore
repeat, that it is a violent presumption to charge
that Bank with such folly. My life on it, that if
ti  constituted authorities of Pennsylvania were to
charge it with this \ idation of its charter, it would
promptly ieuy it It would say, "Shake not your
gory locks ai me, you cannot say 'twas / that did
it " And go, sir, to the direetor- ef the late
Bank of the United Stafs, and charge the ret upon
them, and their ready and evasive icplj will be,
'We do not issue these nows Thj charter un-
der which we once acted has exptred The Bank
we once directed is defunct1" And thus, sir, they
"palter in a double sense," aad by the vilest equi-
vocation, peipetrate, and may ptrpehmte a fraud,
unless Con5ress interposes its power to prevent it
The time has been when the good old maxim " qm
fa-tt per ahum facit per se" was mtelligib'e and valu-
able, but modern bank ie°rei demma and hocus poeus
nullifies its salutary princ pie with the same ease
and complacency with which it has heretofore de-
fied jour laws, and disiegarded the plainest obliga-
tio s ef commercial morality.
The whole *mount of the game played by the
la e Bank is this I make mjself trustee or agent
fcr myself, and by that mi olution of terms, and
consequent eonfusion of ídtas, they are enabled to
assume or shift obligations, as interest or policy
may dictate Nieholas Biddle and Co president
and directors of the Bank of the Lmied Stales of
Pennsylvania, become trustees or agents for the
s-iine ¿sicoolas B ddle ana Co directors of the late
Bonh of the ¡JíiiíeJ Staffs, and by quibbling,
trickery, anfcunning, one is made to mean two,
and tuo to mean one, as occasion may prompt
Suppose, Mr President, that the State of Penn-
sjlvama hid not chartered her bank and instead
< t th t Bank undertaking to w md up the affair 
of the late Bank of the United States, that v ou and
I or other individuals, had assumed that dutj
think you that by issuing and reissu ng, «at would
h<n e been permitted to keep m c rculation mi'lions
of the notes oí that Bank up to this tune or the
end of iimp' And u not, to what other law but the
livv ot Congas* should we be amenab e for the at-
empt to do so? Suppose that the Bank of ti e
United States of Pennsvlvama should forfeit its
charter, and cease to exist is it pretended that
there would be no power to withdraw from circula-
tion 'he notes in question, and that sue might, bv
another dei ,ce, keep m circulation as long as «t.
pleased, all the paper she now has o it'
Mr. Preudent, I, as chairman el the Cc mmittee.
