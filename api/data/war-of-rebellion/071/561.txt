HDQRS. DEPT. OF WASHINGTON, 22nd ARMY CORPS,August 1, 1864--12 p. m.

DEAR GROVER: The cavalry scouts report the enemy advancing on the Rockville road toward Tennallytown. It is not known in what force. General Halleck wishes you to move at once with your command to that place. I hope none of your command has left town as yet. Stop all that you can and take them with you. Call at my office as you come along. I will be here.

Yours, truly,

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.

GENERAL: Immediately after sending you the sergeant's report, I sent for and getting this brigade in shape, I sent for the corporal, whose report is as follows:

Was stationed at Rockville; patrolled to Offutt's Cross-Roads; was relieved at 4 o'clock. Mail captured at Poolesville between 2 and 3 o'clock. Enemy lying in woods there, in wait for wagon train, infantry and cavalry. Some Maine cavalry brought in four of Mosby's men just before he left, after which he heard three shots. Citizens leaving, coming this way. Rumors all make it Longstreet's corps. Stage horses sent this way.
