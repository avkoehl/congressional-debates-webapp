the right of your picket-line, if you have not already done so, to connect with it in the advance position. He captured 100 prisoners, with very slight loss to us.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General SHERMAN:

A rebel scouting party which came into Decatur this morning informed the citizens that the railroad had been cut by our cavalry at a place called Jonesborough, as it was understood by Colonel Garrard, who brought the report.

General ASCHOFIELD:

I am starting for the right. It may became necessary to shift you to the extreme right, in which case our left will be back of Pea Vine creek, from General Wood's right back to the rebel lines, with a detachment at Buck Head, but this I do not propose till General Garrard is back.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., July 30, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

I have over to the right to-day. Our troops are on the Sandtown road. The enemy must follow that movement, and if they hold a force on your left front, it is only for effect. They will weaken about General Stanley. I will come over to-morrow. I hope to hear of our cavalry to-morrow. When it is back, I will probably shift you over to the right.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,July 30, 1864-8 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The enemy has shown more force than usual in his main works in my front to-day, and has been erecting a battery a short distance in front of his old works on the railroad brigade, where I pressed him closely on the 28th. Colonel Garrard reports no movement on our left, except a small body of cavalry, which he drove from Decatur this morning.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
