BOLIVAR, TENN., September 20, 1862.

Brigadier General JOHN A. LOGAN, Jackson, Tenn.:

I have this morning moved Lauman, with five regiments, twelve pieces of artillery, and 400 cavalry, toward Grand Junction. They will either find and fight the enemy or the rebels will pass our flank or disperse. I want the wagon road to Jackson put in order. Will you see to it in your district?

If they pass us in force it will be downstream toward Brownsville.

[S. A. HURLBUT,]

Brigadier-General.

BOLIVAR, September 21, 1862-11 a. m.

Major JOHN A. RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

General Lauman and command 5 miles from Grand Junction. Cavalry advanced as far as Grand Junction, finding no enemy, but best information that portion of force lately in vicinity had left in direction of Corinth, leaving about 2,500 at Davis' Mill. Lauman has orders to attack, if sure of the results, and destroy Davis' Mill and will probably do so this night or to-morrow morning.

I learn from scouts that Villepigue and Jackson's cavalry left day before yesterday for east, probably Corinth. Force at Davis' Mill under command of General Bowen.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Brigadier-General.

BOLIVAR, September 21, 1862.

General GRANT:

General Lauman sends me a verbal message by an orderly that the enemy are flanking him on the left, and is rapidity falling back. He is 6 miles below. Shall I move the rest of the division out or wait for him to come in? Stores here are of great value, and I dislike to leave them without guard. Answer at once.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Brigadier-General.

BOLIVAR, September 21, 1862.

General GRANT:

General Lauman is attacked 10 miles below here, as I learn by orderly sent in by Colonel Noble with verbal message. I have five regiments here. Shall I move them from this post? Answer at once.

BOLIVAR, September 21, 1862.

General GRANT:

General Lauman's command has returned all safe. The cavalry and some infantry followed close up as far as Van Buren, where a few well-directed shots scattered them. Further particulars will be sent by mail to-morrow.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Brigadier-General.
