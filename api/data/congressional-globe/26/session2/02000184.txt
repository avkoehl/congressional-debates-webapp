CIVIL AND DIPLOMATIC APPROPRIA1IOH BILL
On motion of Mr. JONES ot Virgin a, the House
resolved itself into a Committee of the Wnole on
the state of th? Union, (Mr Bell in the chan,)
and resumed the consideration of the bi 1 making
appropnat on* for the civil and diplc matic ex
penses of the Government for the year 1841 The
question pending was the motion of Mr Green lo
strike cut all the items of appropriation having re-
ference to the Branch Mint  of North Carolina,
Georgia and New Orleans, and the expenditures
connected therewith
M<\ BYNUM, being entitled to the floor, com
menced his remarks by sajinglhathe had deter-
m ned to remain a silent spectator in the House for
at least one session His peculiar situation, and
the recent development of events-, had induced him
to adhere to that res lution But since he had a -
tended to the debates in ihe Hous-, such had been
ihe extra rdmay, unprovoked, unju t course pur-
sued by certain gentlemen, that, to reman longer
silent, when he had an oppoitunny of speaking,
would, in his opinion, be a dereliction of duty—an
act of treachery, if not ireason, to the portion of
country of which he was the representative on the
floor of Congress
Mr B said the  immediate  proposition before
the Houce was to s nktj out a small appropriation
for the continuation of the mints south of the Pt-
tomac    It was  not the amou it of 'money  that
added consequence to the motion—¡bat was írsig-
nificant within itse f    Had that been the ca«e, I e
would have been ihe last man in the House to open
his mouth, but he thought he. orrceived in this ms
tion   of  ihe   gentleman   from    Kentucky,   [Mr
Green,] (although Mr B   did  rot know  it was
even Mr G's intention )  an  msidiou  desrn, an
msidiouo attempt, to strike down the onlv prospects
which the country had for a permanent, consutu
tional, and stable currency for  the people of the
country.
Particularly and emphatically (said Mr B ) did
this proposition affect, most «ensfbly and deeply,
the portion of the people of the country whose le
presentative he was He alluded to the great grow-
ing, agricultural, planting, and producing ín'eres's,
which, if he had not mistaken the signs ot the
tim^s were now prostrated at the feet of the non-
productive, non-laboring, non "gncultura!|portion
of the country
Mr B after some remarks in regard to ihe de-
sign of the framers of the Constitution, said there
was a certain fowl, which, when chased from ihe
fields, set up the cry of "caw1 caw ''" with as much
meaning and regularly as the notes of Opposition
gentlemen in their cry of profligacy1 correption'
extravagance' as apphtd to the present Administra-
tion
Mr. B then demonstrated the means which were
at the disposition of those who complained so much
of the extravagance of the Administration to
correct the abuse, and referred to the
political complexion of several standing commit-
tees of the House Upon the Committee on Ex-
penditures m the Department of Stata, there were
three Whigs and two Democrats On the Com-
mittee on th" Expenditures m the Depar ment of
ine Treasury, three Wbigs and two Democrat*.
O i the Committee on Expenditures m the Depart-
ment of War, three Whigs and two Democrats
On the Committee on Expenditures in the Depart
ment of iheNav}, three Whis;-. and two Demo-
crats On the Comm ttee on Exp^ndituies in the
Department of the Post Office, three Whigs
and two Democrats On tbe Committee on
Expenditures on the Public Buildings, three
Whigs and two Democrats The chairman
of each of ihe committees was a Whig, and Mr
B contended that if all the charges of profl gacy
and cor-uption bad been true, thue was every op
portumty for those who made them to call the com-
mittees together, and make investigation, and es-
tablish their position
Mr B illns'rated the dangerous tendency of a
Bank of the United States, and showed wherein
ihe operations of banking institutions generally
acted upon the productive interests of the country,
depressing labor and supporting the non producers
a' the expense of the laboring portion of the
country
Mr B. in the course of his remarks, incidentally
alluded to several other subjests, and proved con-
clusively, from the report of the Secretary of the
Trea.ury, mide m compliance with a resoluuon of
the Senate, that the people had paid a tax to the
banks, since the organmation of th* Government,
sufficient to carry en its operations,tit

Mr B replied to the remarks of several gentle-
men who had preceded him, and concluded by ex-
pre sing the opinion, that should the Independent
Treasury law be repealed, (which he would consider
tantamount to a repeal of the Constitution) a Na-
tional Bank would be erec ed upon us rums, and
wield its scppira over the country, and make its
power perpetual
[The remarks of Mr B are in a coarse of
preparation, and will be given hereafter ]
Mr TILLINGHASTadvocated th  amendment
He considered the Mint at Philadelphia sufficient
for a 1 practical purposes, and that these branch
mint=, at suah distant portions of ihe Republic,
were a useless expense
Mr WILLIAMS ef Norti Cirolma opposed
the amendmpnt H  was in 'aver of giving
ih~ branch mints a fair trial, beberé abolí hing
them
Mr HABERSHAM al o oppo ed the amend-
ment and replied with much force to the objecliens
raised by Mr Tili inghast
Mr EVERETT objected to the proposition to
strike out, for so long as the law authoriz ng these
mints existed, the House was bound to make the
appropriation If gentlemen objected to them, the
proper course was to repeal the la*
Mr. COOPER of Georgia said that he would add
a few remarks to those made by h s col eague from
Habtr ham county
I find, Mr Chairman, (-said Mr C ) the esta-
blishment of these branch mints to have been a
part of your policy for several years The motion
to strike out involves a change To justify this
change, it should be shown or admitted by the friends
ot the policy, that the reasons foi creating them were
unfounded, or that those reasons have failed to
operate What were those reasons1 The gentle-
man from Vermont has intimated to you, as he did
last session, that ore reafon was to protect the la-
boring classes m he gold region This I do not
agree to, for, with equal propriety, the sama might
be assigned as a reoson for establishing the princi-
pal Mint at Philadelphia which was established be
foie the di coveiy ot gold in North Carolina and
Georgia
Again foreign gold is Kct taxed by th s law to
enhance ihe value of our gol3, but competes fairly
at the Mint with the domestic Therefore, the idea
of protection is misapplied h re The pre umption
is that the objects of the law were to diffuse a me-
tallic currency amongst the mass of the peop e, and
to give to those States which produced the gild the
full benefits of that product, free e f the taxation in-
cident to an exportation to a frre gn ma ket This,
sir, is carrjmg out the principle ot free trade on
terms of equality
But establish your Mint exclusively at Philadel
phia, and whit is ihe effect'   The en ire product of
gold in Georgia, North  Carolina, Alabama,  and
Tennessee, will be shipped to PhiHcUlphia, just as
cotton, rice, or tobacco is to New York or Europ
