The Tariff—Mr. Marshall.
Ho. op Keps.
It is no answer to this to tell me that of
gome articles of woolen production the prices
are as low as when the infamous tariff on
woolens was enacted. Since then our currency-
has approached 80 per cent. nearer to the gold
standard, and the consumers are entitled to
the benefits of this difference. And besides
this the constant tendency of modern civiliza-
tion is to cheapen the prices of staple articles
of manufacture, and it is restrictive legislation
alone that would deprive the people of the
great advantage thereof. It is really amusing
to hear the advocates for monopoly claim as
the result of their oppressive taxation those
changes which are produced by the apprecia-
tion of our currency, discoveries in mechanics
and chemistry, improvements in machinery,
cheaper modes of transportation, diminished
cost of raw material, and all those things, in
fact, which go to make up the progress of this
wonderful age. The true tost is, are we deriv-
ing the benefits of tliia progress ; can we now
procure articles of consumption as cheap as
the people of other nations ; or does the tariff
step in the way as an obstruction to prevent us
from doing so ?
A PROHIBITORY TAX.
But the duties on a large number of articles
that enter into the general consumption of the
people, many of them absolutely necessary for
their comfort and happiness, are so diabolically
high as to be absolutely or virtually prohib-
itory, cutting off all importations, and conse-
quently all the revenues derived therefrom. In
such cases there is a double fraud and robbery:
a robbery of the people of their substance, and
a robbery of Government of its revenues. Such
are the duties laid upon many of the articles
of woolen manufacture, such as the flannels,
shirts and drawers, shawls, blankets, druggets,
carpets, &c., that go into the general consump-
tion of the masses. The enormous tax laid on
these articles, amounting in some instances to
over 200 per cent, and in the aggregate to
many million dollars, is collected regularly
from the consumers, just as the tax on coffee
and tea is collected, but with this important
difference: that not one dollar of this immense
tax paid on these manufactured articles goes
into the public Treasury, but every dollar
thereof goes from the pockets of the consum-
ers into the tills of the manufacturers. _ This
is 11 protection protection of homo indus-
try;" the very devil of protection in its worst
and most objectionable form, with its horns and
cloven foot exposed to public indignation. But
whatever form, or under whatever illusive and
captivating disguise it may appear, it is the
same child of fraud and sin, the spoiler of an
unsuspecting and credulous people.
WASTEFULNESS OP MIS SYSTEM.
But it should be noted here as an additional
objection to this system of taxation that a con-
siderable portion of the sum thus taken from
the people is a positive waste and destruction
of property of which no one receives any bene-
fit. This is so to a greater or less extent in
all cases where the domestic manufacture could
not be conducted here without the duty or pro-
tection. Suppose that a certain manufacture
requires a bounty or duty of 30 per cent, to
make it a merely ordinarily remunerative busi-
ness, and that with less it could not exist with
profit. A duty of40 percent is laid; thegoods
are enhanced to that extent in price; the con-
sumer pays the tax of 40 per cent, upon the
entire domestic production as well as foreign,
but the manufacturer derives an extra profit
of only 10 per cent. The other 30 per cent,
is absolutely lost by the operation. It is in
fact, that much of the capital of the country
blotted out of existence. Suppose the amount
paid on domestic production by the consumers
by reason of this tax to amount to $4,000,000.
Of the 40 per cent, of which this is made up the
manufacturers get as their clear profits but 10
per cent.,or one fourth. The other three fourths,
or $8,000,000 of the capital of the country, is ab-
solutely annihilated by the operation, as much
so as if it had been swallowed up by an earth-
quake. Indeed thifs waste is going on all the
time under the operation of the tariff, even in
those manufactures that would prosper here
were no such thing as a tariff known. For as
the tariff is laid on almost innumerable articles,
it enhances greatly the cost of all production,
and of the tax laid or bounty given for any
given manufacture but a portion inures to the
benefit of the manufacturer, the residue being
absolute waste. And when we assert that the
money of which the consumer is despoiled goes
directly to the protected class, it is always to
be understood in connection with this explan-
ation.
The system, too, debauches and demoral-
izes both capital and labor, and discourages,
where it does not destroy, economy, diligence,
invention, and that close application and atten-
tion to all the details of business which become
necessary under free competition. Why should
these virtues be cultivated ! The Government
has taken charge of this industry and has de-
termined that it shall be a remunerative one.
If it does not yield a handsome profit at 20 per
cent, all that is necessary is to run to Congress
and the bounty or duty is promptly increased
to 30, 40, 50, or even 100 or 200 per cent. The
effect is obvious aud its bad influence upon our
whole industrial system manifest.
PROTECTION DRIVES OUR PRODUCTIONS FROM THE MAR-
KETS OF THE WORLD.
The greatest curse, however, inflicted upon
the business of the country by this system re-
sults from the fact that by enhancing the cost
of production in every branch of industry we
are" necessarily to a great extent driven from
the markets of the world. And even where
we can still compete with other nations we must
do so under great difficulties and without that
profit that would otherwise be ours. To com-
pete successfully for the sale of our productions
in the markets of the world we must bo able to
produce as cheaply and sell as low as other
nations. This is too self-evident to require
illustration. But a protective tariff enhances
the cost of all productions, and necessarily
and inevitably tends to deprive us of our best
and most extensive markets, lleason should
teach us this much without experience, and a
disastrous experience has come to fortify the
deductions of reason.
With the great increase of our population,
and with all the heavy burdens we have im-
posed upon ourselves to bolster our manufac-
tures, official statistics show that our annual
export of domestic manufactures has actually,
under the operation of the present tariff, fallen
off within eight years nearly §10,000,000, a
fact worthy of the attention of the gentleman
from Pennsylvania, [Mr. Keixey,] who par-
aded here the other day with great solemnity
the wonderful fact that our citizens are now
actually competing with other nations in the
sale of horseshoe nails, shovels, axes, sausage-
mills, rat-traps, Yankee notions, aud a few
other articles, and evidently thought that this
exportation of domestic manufactures was a
thing of recent growth, and that we were in-
debted to the marvelous virtues of tho Morrill
tariff for tho fact that we could export one dol-
lar's worth of our own productions ; and the
gentleman predicted that if we would give a
tittle more protection we would soon be driv-
ing with our manufactures the English, the
French, and the Germans out of every market.
The gentleman always takes it for granted, as
an unquestioned fact, that all the '' industries''
of the country—and by that he means manufac-
tures and coal-digging, for he evidently does not
think that anything else is an industry that
all the industries of this country are the cre-
ation of the tariff; yes, of the Morrill tariff;
and that there would never have been a man-
ufacturing establishment in this country if the
beautiful invention called a tariff had never
been discovered; that all this wealth of iron,
and copper, and coal, and timber, and cotton,
and wool, and water-power with which God has
so wonderfully blessed our land would have
remained disused forever; that our people have
not the talents, the energy, the ingenuity, or
the perseverance to utilize these great resources
without the miserable tinkering called protect-
ive legislation.
If the honorable gentleman had studied the
history and laws of trade as he should have
done he would know that manufactures took
root in our country during the colonial period
with the other infant industries, not only with-
out protection but in the very teeth of adverse
British legislation, and that they would grow
with the growth of the country if a tariff had
never been heard of; that neither they nor
any other industry need what is called protec-
tion for their healthy growth and development;
that this is an age of wonderful energy and
activity; that the demand for and consumption
of coal and iron are increasing with extraor-
dinary rapidity; and that with the tariff stricken
from the statute-book the demand would be
greater, the cost of production lessened, and
tho actual increase of production doubled with-
in a few years from this time.
The honorable gentleman will doubtless be
surprised when I inform him that during the
low tariff of 1857, the lowest we have had
since 1816, we not only had manufactures in
our country, but we were actually exporting
largely of our domestic manufactures; and this
export was increasing rapidly until the pas-
sage of the Morrill protective tariff, since which
time the exports have fallen off $10,000,000.
I refer the gentleman and the committee to
the table which I herewith present:
" The decreasing export of domestic manufacture*•—

turey from tho United States for tho twclvo fiscal

1808  37,856,723
" .From 1857 to 18b0 tho increase was nearly 16} per
eont., at which ratio tho exports of 1868 would have
amounted to about $71,000,000. If wo assume 10 per
cent, as the ratio of increase for threoyears, itwould
have been about 360,000,000, whilo they attained but
the sum of $37,8^6,723."
It will be seen from this that our exports of
manufactured articles are now only about one
half what they would be if protection had not
obtruded its destroying presence.
I will also invite the attention of the gen-
tleman to the table which I here present of
tlie export of certain staple manufactures for
the years 1857, 1860, and 18G8. The high
protective tariff, it will be remembered, was
enacted in 18G1, and it is interesting to see
how rapidly our exports of these articles in-
creased under the low tariff, and how wonder-
fully they have declined since the adoption of
the high tariff now in force:
