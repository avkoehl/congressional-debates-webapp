SIR: You will please find inclosed copy of telegrams this day sent to Major-General Burnside and W. W. Wright, superintendent Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad.

DECEMBER 18, 1862.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Colonel Clarke reports by letter that there is great difficulty in procuring hands for the work at Aquia; that labor is scarce and high. If there is no other important service for them to perform, I would suggest that one regiment of the engineer troops, or, perhaps, one brigade, be sent to Aquia Creek, to assist in finishing the new wharf and connecting railroad. They can cut piles, load and handle timber, and grade road. They should report to W. W. Wright, who will have instructions as to the dispositions to be made of them.

H. HAUPT.

DECEMBER 18, 1862.

W. W. WRIGHT,

Aquia Creek:

If any engineer troops are sent to you, place as many as can be employed under charge of Anderson, to construct new road, cut piles, and load lumber. Clarker's men, of whom the advance guard will leave to-day, will be best employed upon the wharf. I will give you further and more specific instructions by letter.

H. HAUPT.

General-in-Chief.
