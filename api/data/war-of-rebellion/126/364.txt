A statement of quartermaster's property on hand, received from officers, purchased, manufactured, captured, taken up, &amp;c., issued and transferred, sold, died, lost, expended, &c.

A statement of clothing, camp and garrison equipage, ditto, ditto.

A statement of the number of miles of land and submarine telegraph line constructed, repaired, abandoned, &c., and a statement of the number of telegrams transmitted over said line.

Since my last annual report I have been on duty as assistant quartermaster and assistant superintendent U. S. Military Telegraph from June 30, 1864, to September 30, 1864, in charge of lines in Department of Arkansas, and from October 1, 1864, to June 30, 1865, in charge of lines in Departments of Missouri, Kansas, and Arkansas, as per your orders.

My monthly and annual "line and cable reports" give a detailed statement of the number of miles of line constructed, repaired, abandoned, &c.

Although the lines under my control for the last nine months of the year ending June 30, 1865, embrace a large territory, we have managed to keep them almost constantly in operation, day and night, to the full satisfaction of all officers from the division to the post commanders.

As the country became more settled and peaceable I gradually reduced my expenses, and, although I have always had sufficient force for emergencies, I have rarely permitted a man to be idle a signal day.

Since I have had charge of the lines in Missouri, Kansas, and Arkansas (1,702 miles) I have operated, constructed, and repaired them at about an average cost of $15,000 per month, and I am weekly reducing expenses without detriment to the service.

When it is taken into consideration that these lines are all single-that is, one wire on one set of poles (which requires twice as many operators and repairers as double wires)-and that the country has been full of thieving, wire-cutting guerrillas, while U. S. troops have been "few and far between," I think that my expense account will compare favorably with any other telegraphic department in the United States.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. CLOWRY,

Captain A. Q. M., and Asst. Supt. U. S. Military Telegraphs, Missouri, Kansas, and Arkansas.
