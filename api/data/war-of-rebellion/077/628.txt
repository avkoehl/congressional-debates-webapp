STEVENSON, ALA., October 2, [1], 1864.

Captain RAMSEY,

Asst. Adjt. General, Major-General Thomas's Staff:

The First, Second, and one regiment of the THIRD Brigade, and Barnett's battery at this point. As soon as the trains are arranged will move out on the Huntsville road. Guerrilla attack on this road about twelve miles from here, tearing up track, destroying 2 or 3 cars, and killing 1 or 2 men. Construction train has been sent out to repaid road. No telegraph communication with Huntsville. No commissary supplies here. I have ordered some forward with THIRD Brigade, which I hope will be pushed forward promptly. I learn the Huntsville road is almost entirely unprotected. If I find all right at Huntsville, shall I hold my trains and return by rail to Stevenson? Shall probably be here long enough for an answer.

JAMES D. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General.
