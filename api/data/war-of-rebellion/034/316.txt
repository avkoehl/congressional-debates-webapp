Numbers 15. Reports of Colonel D. W. Chenault, Eleventh Kentucky Cavalry (Confederate).

IN CAMP ON JIMTOWN ROAD,

Eight miles from Monticello, April 29, 1863 - 6 a. m.

As previously reported, the enemy crossed the Cumberland in force yesterday at two points. We skirmished with them until dark last night; lost no men, except 4 sick and 4 pickets. I will fall back to a point near Albany, where they cannot flank me from Burkesville, as I learn from Colonel [J. J.] Morrison that there was heavy cannonading at Celina on 28th. He is still at Albany. Major [R. S.] Bullock is white me, with Colonel [R. S.] Cluke's regiment.

Yours, in haste,

D. W. CHENAULT,

Colonel.

General JOHN H. MORGAN.

GENERAL: The enemy ar eon this side of the river, and pressing hard upon me - three regiments if infantry and one of cavalry. Without help I shall not be able to hold this point long. I have written Colonel [J. J.] Morrison for re-enforcements. Do not know whether I will get them or not.

In haste, general, yours, &amp;c.,

D. W. CHENAULT,

Colonel.

General JOHN H. MORGAN.

[P. S.]- I have only about 600 men and [John S.] Scott's two bull pups.

TWELVE MILES FROM MONTICELLO,

On Jimtown Road, May 1, 1863 - Sundown.

GENERAL: I hasten to inform you that the enemy have driven me to this point. Early this morning Colonel [J. J.] Morrison moved up from Albany to my relief with [John] Pegram's brigade. They ambushed him, and have taken all his artillery, except the two bull pups I had with me. His forces are very much demoralized.* I shall move with all dispatch on to Livingston.

Yours, in haste,

D. W. CHENAULT,
