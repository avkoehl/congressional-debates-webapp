DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,

September 1, 1864.

Respectfully returned.

I am not aware what the design is at Plaquemine to call for this regiment. This place is not now within my control in any way, but if it be intended to carry out the recommendations of General Andrews at Brashear and Berwick, which I have strongly recommended with certain additions, I do hope that this regiment will be ordered there in order that important point may be thoroughly secured as soon as possible. If that recommendation is to be carried out it should be done at once. If not, it should be immediately known, so that Berwick may receive an addition to its present armament to thoroughly secure it.

T. W. SHERMAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
