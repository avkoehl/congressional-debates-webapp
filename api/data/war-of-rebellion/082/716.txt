Colonel ABBOT:

I have telegraphed to General Ingalls for cars to carry seven of your Parrotts, ammunition and detachments, to City Point. Hunt says they go there-the guns and ammunition. I have telegraphed for a locomotive for the heavy mortar. The Coehorns and siege mortars cannot be sent to-night; time will not allow.
