Major General WILLIAM NELSON,

Commanding, &amp;c., Louisville, Ky.:

General Ketchum informs me that five Illinois regiments are under orders for Louisville and ten more will be sent next week. Granger's command is gone. Two hundred wagons are on the way to Louisville or being loaded on boats for that place. Make requisitions loaded on boats for that place.

Have you any intelligence from Buell and is the surrender of Munfordville certain? Send back the boats for troops.
