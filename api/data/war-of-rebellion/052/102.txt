Captain LEE:

Six deserters came in this morning from Seventh Mississippi;very difficult to get away;rebel pickets doubled and increased vigilance. Brigade opposite much demoralized;have not received re-enforcements;nothing that looks like a move at present. Say that Johnston has re-enforced Bragg at Chattanooga with 10,000 men,and more coming there. Brigade on quarter rations. Ladies under way,expected at 11 o'clock this a.m. Will there be a train up?

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Stevenson, August 21, 1863-11 a.m.

Major-General CRITTENDEN,

Dunlap: All your dispatches have been received. Thank for your prompt movements and reports. Hope to know the news your way soon. Rebels pickets the river strongly opposite us. I think you will draw them toward Chattanooga. News from Charleston merely contained favorable progress of siege. Rebel papers say walls of Sumter pretty well pitted. Thomas and McCook reached here yesterday.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

TRACY CITY, August 21, 1863.

General GARFIELD:

Palmer and reconnaissance left yesterday. The only report received is from Palmer,who was as Poe's Tavern yesterday at 5.30. Wilder was with him,and moved forward this morning. He found a picket at that point,attacked it,wounding 2,took several prisoners,and wheels of rebels wagons;ha hears of no enemy this side of the river,trough they are as high up as Harrison. Certainly the rumors are numerous,yet none look to the immediate evacuation of Chattanooga. Not a word from headquarters since leaving Manchester.

L. T. CRITTENDEN.

By order of Major-General Crittenden:
