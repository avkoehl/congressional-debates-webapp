Major-General EWELL:

GENERAL: The general commanding Valley District directs that if your troops have rations cooked for to-morrow you have rations for the 6th cooked and put in their haversacks, so as to have two days' rations. That you also have them provided to-day with ammunition, &amp;c., for active service.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. S. PENDLETON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

RICHMOND, VA., June 4, 1862.

General THOMAS J. JACKSON,

Commanding in the Valley of Virginia:

GENERAL: I return to you my congratulations for the brilliant campaign you have conducted against the enemy in the valley of Virginia. Were it practicable to send to you re-enforcements it should be done, and your past success shows how surely you would, with an adequate force, destroy the wicked designs of the invader of our homes and assailed of our political rights. From the Honorable Mr. Boteler i have learned something of your probable movements. At this distance it is not possible to obtain such exact information as would justify a conclusion, but I hope you will not find at Front Royal a force which you cannot overcome. The only aid which seemed to be in reach was such as could be collected at Staunton. The commanding office at that place has been directed to gather all he could and move down the valley to communicate with you. Such a movement may have an effect on the enemy beyond its real value. But it is on your skill and daring that reliance is to be places. The army under your command encourages us to hope for all which men can achieve.

Very respectfully and truly, yours,

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
