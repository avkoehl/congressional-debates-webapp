Will you suggest to the lieutenant-general to have all regular approaches at the salient discontinued and have them begun at other places in the line to prevent attracting attention until he has examined the ground and made up his mind for himself?

Colonel BURTON,Fifth U. S. Arty., Chief of Artillery, 18th Army Corps:

COLONEL: In view of the increase of the enemy's mortar fire on my front, I most respectfully request that an addition of from four to five 8-inch mortars may be added to the artillery of my line that I may keep a preponderance of vertical fire. Only by keeping down the enemy's fire can I escape from a most severe daily loss of life.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
