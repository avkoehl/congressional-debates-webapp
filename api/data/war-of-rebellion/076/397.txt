these circumstances shall I forward the battery? I have no particular use for it here, but it is in poor condition. All right about Parson Johnson, and Mead reported with 250 men north of the river, between Flint and Paint Rock. Anderson after them with about 400 of his regiment. I don't believe Forrest dead, nor expect him here, though some of his men have very recently been killed by my scouting parties in Middle Tennessee. Hammer at Atlanta; we rejoice at every blow.

DECATUR, ALA., August 6, 1864.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Major-General Sherman having asked what troops can be spared from this district, I have notified him and Major-General Rousseau that the Tenth Indiana Cavalry could be replaced by a regiment of colored troops if there was one disposable to relieve it. Colored troops will do for the block-houses. As there is no probability of the Ninth Ohio or the Fourth Tennessee returning to this district, I do not think it advisable to part with more cavalry. I have the honor to report the Third Brigade, Sixteenth Corps, as being relieved from duty here and now en route for the front; same reported to Major-General Rousseau.
