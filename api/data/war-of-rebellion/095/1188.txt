I have the honor to be, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Started from camp the evening of 27th of March, 1865; marched all night, crossing both the James and Appomattox Rivers; arrived at the Second Army Corps encampment March 29, 1865, relieving part of that corps. Left camp the evening of the 2nd [1st] instant; marched to the left on Hatcher's Run; prepared for a fight. April 3 [2] was ordered to support Sixth Army Corps, and during the day made, with our division, a charge on Fort Gregg, within the enemy's line. Lost 16 killed, 45 wounded. Took up the line of march the 4th [3rd] instant along with the army.

At a skirmish near Appomattox Court-House, April 9, 1865, there was 1 commissioned officer and 6 enlisted men wounded.

There has been but very little straggling during the late march.
