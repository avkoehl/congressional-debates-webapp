To show the increase directly clue to rail-
roads in the values of the country, permit mc
to read a short extract from the recent speech
of General Walbridge, made in Cincinnati:
" Iu a period of seventeen years the rmleaso of our
railways had increased uearly four hundred pel* cent.,
their tonnage one thousand per cent., with a eoi re-
sponding increase of value. The population ot ihe
country m the meantime hadinereasedfioin twenty-
tour to thiriy-aix millions, or at tne rate ot titty per
cent. Iu other words, tho increase ot the commerce
ot the country borne upon railroads has been two
thous.mdioLd frr«.sitcr to that of our population. In
1851 thetreight moved upon all the railroads equaled
tour huadredand seven ecu pounds per head ox pop-
ulation. Ifs v« luo oqu^lcd say thirty-one dollars
per head. In ISiS the unmade equaled two thousand
seven hundiedand seventy-seven pouuds per head,
having a value of $J10 p«r head. The increase of the
tonnage of railroads tor the period named has been
wholly a creation oftheso works, as there has at the
same time been a very large increase of merchandise
moved uoon the watei -courses of the country.

road then in operation in the United States equaled

The results achieved in a single State will be
found, ou examination, to be quite us striking as is
the aggregate tor tile whole nation. There were in
the State of Illinois iu 1831 iwo hundred and titty
miles of ramvay, too cost ot' winch was about seven
million live hundredthous.uiddoihirs. Tuctouiiago
ot these ro.tds, only just opened, could not have
exceeded one liuudred thousand tons, liavingavaiuo
say of $15,000,000. At the close ot 186? thero ,.ere
three thousand two hundred and lifty miles of rail-
road in operation in the State, having a touuuge
traffic of nr. loj,st fivemillioii tons, possessing a value
of at least $750,000,030. Xhcoostof i ho roads equaled
SloO,000,000. The value of the comrno ce transported
over them in one year equaled very nearly six tinges
their cost. In 1851 the number of pounds of mer-
chandise transported by these roads equaled about
two hundred pounds per head of population.
"Iu 1^67 tho tonnage trail-ported exooeded four
thousand pounds, or two tons per head. The value
of the touaago per head ill 1851 was about HI teen
dollars i in 1807 it was equal to $330 per head. This
unexampled increase was wholly due to the con-
struction of railroads, as there has in tho meantime
been a very large iucreaso in the tonnage on tho
water-courses of tho State. It will be boi ne in mind
that the tonnage of railroads of this State consists
almost entirely of the pro >uets of agriculturo which
will boar transportation lor only a comparatively
small distance over oiduinry roads. These products
are now forwarded, on an average, twUo hundred
miles before reaching a m iiket.
"The population ot Illinois now makes ono fif-
teenth ot that of the whole Country. It now defrays
ono fifteenth ot the whole burdens of tho Uoneral
Government. Its proportion of tho Federal taxes
equals iZl.OOO.OUO annually. Its ability to pay this
vastsuni is almost entiiely duo to the railroads that
have been constructed withiu it during tho past
fifteen years.''
Grand as this progress is, a greater growth is
before us. Europe is sending us her hardy and
industrious sons, with their trained hands and
heads, to assist, us in the work ot'development.
Since the war ourown young men seem inspired
with greater iiope and vigor. They are no longer
found idling their days away in small towns, or
listlessly si rolling lVoni place to place seeking
amusement. The game ol marbles and quoits,
even at Ba.scoui'sgrocery,is becoming obsolete,
'l'he young rneu are at work, cheerfully and
earnestly. The railroad enterprises of the land
are being pushed on with increased vigor.
Through routes and great trunk lines will not
suffice. Every village must now have its iron
track; and East, West, North and South the
iron horse is rinding his way up and down all
the valleys, over the hills, undei the mountains,
wherever the farmer, the mechanic, the miner
or the merchant can liud prolitahle freights to
draw. The great corporations are putting out
their feelers in every direction, and at no time
have these enterprises commanded so much at-
tention oradded so much to values. The Paeilic
road is beingpushedon with unparalleled speed.
This year will see its completion—the grand
est work of all the ages and races of man,
destined to add value untold to our territories
by their settlement,by the opening of the mines,
and by the increase of business ; destined to
change the great currents of commerce from
China and the Indies, and make them tributary
to us ; destined to make our great seaports
the centers of the world's trade, and to give to
New York and San Francisco that comparative
importance once held by the great ports of the
Levant, Venice, Genoa, Marseilles, and after-
ward by the cities of Holland and the Hanse
towns, and more recently by London,Liverpool,
Havre, and Glasgow. The great silver and
gold lodes of our western mountains will be
traversed by this thoroughfare. Where we now
get ninety millions a year of precious metal we
will get three hundred.
We have but just begun their development.
The hardy miner with his pick upon his shoul-
der, driving his ox team over plain and mount-
ain, desert and river, more than a thousand
miles, hauls his quartz-mill and his supplies
and tears the glittering treasures from nature's
great store-house in her remotest solitudes,
unbroken before by the voice of civilization.
When the railway train can take tools, machin- !j
ery, and supplies in and ores out; when miners |
and farmers, merchants and manufacturers, j
can pour into those rich regions as they now ,j
throng Hie highways of our central Stales. ,j
it is but reasonable to suppose that the gold ■
product will be more than quadrupled. jj
Let him who is eager lor specie payment '■
look iu this direction for it, rather than into II
the formal enactments of the statute-book.
Here it is no dream. Here it will be a grand
reality. The southern States are to be devel-
oped by free labor, and the national growth in
this direction must be vast. Slavery having
impeded progress there, where the advantages
ot climate and production are urtequnled in
our country, cotton will aid totiirn the tide of
foreign gold in our favor. Tobacco, sugar,
hemp, rice, as well as wheat, corn, cattle, and
hogs, the thousand products of the field, or-
chard, vineyard, pasture,andplantation, areyet
to crowd the markets ot tlie South, where in-
dustrious hands guided by intelligent heads,
inspired by the fruits of free exertion, find the
amplest rewards. To-day that region furnishes
a more inviting field to the immigrant than
any portion of the Union. Soil, water, tim-
ber, minerals, overhung by the sky of Italy
and favored by the most delightful climate,
tempt mankind to enter and possess thetn.
Here is growth ; here is gold ; here is specie
payment by divine right. When that region
supplies itself with breadstuffs and meat, with
wool, cattle, horses, and mules, and yields a
surplus to be added to the great staples of
export now made, as it can and surely will, we
may expect substantial help in paying off our
debt and appreciating our currency.
This vast development, East and West,
North, center, and South, is in the immediate
future. Thirty years of prosperous national
life will see us with double our present popu-
lation and treble our wealth. With such ail
increase, such sure coming prosperity, why
should we burden ourselves with the payment
of a debt which posterity can discharge with-
out an effort? Why should we waste our .
strength in ineffectual struggles to give present ^
value and currency to our promises which are w
well secured, and which long before they fall
due will be worth their face in gold ? Let us
make haste slowly. The world will find out
our stability and strength, and give to ns in
greater measuret,ban to venerable monarchies
that slow growing confidence which we deserve.
Adopt such a policy as that, the demand
for the precious metals will bo diminished,
while the supply is increased and the way to
specie payment is open. Authorize, no such
contracts payable in gold, either at their face
or at a premium, or in any shape whatever,
for either measure will vastly augment the
demand. Cut, down, by the passage of a fund-
ing bill, the rate of interest, and thus dimiuish
the demand. Cutoff all imports of luxuries
possible, diminishing the drain still further.
Ou the other hand, develop the country—open
every avenue of improvement. Unlock the
vast mir.es of the West and pour out their
treasures. Encourage our manufacturing in-
terests. Foster foreign trade; send abroad
our cotton and whatever we may have to sell,
and turn the tides of commerce in our favor.
Enable the people to pay their taxes by a lib-
eral policy ; do not cramp them by contraction
in any form. Expand the currency to meet
the reasonable wants of community. By all
these means increase their individual wealth
and ability to pay debts, and the country
will rise in credit and power with tham,
and it never will without them. Having thus
increased the supply of gold we can talk
rationally about resumption. This is the grad-
ual and easy method which increases the
power to pay without increasing indebtedness
and without destroying the prices of labor and
property, and, instead of cutting down paper
to a gold standard, elevates and enhances it
till it becomes its equal.
Iu the primal days of Earth it is said that a
wide waste of waters slumbered upon the whole
face of the globe ; but the day came when the
convulsions of nature broke the vast strata of
iocks that underlav th$ ocean and heaved
islands and continents toward the surface. At
first, the summits of the mountains peered
through the waves, and gradually, in slow years,
lliegreat plains, dripping and oozy, were lifted,
inch by inch, to the sun. And then Morning
came aud sang lier song, aod purple livening
