THE CONQRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 27,
during his absence, had, it was said, informed the
prmteis that the appendix was not considered a
part of the leport There was some mistake in
this With whom it originated he knew not.
Most certainly his colleague, [Mr Mann,] who
had,dunngMr T 's absence, undertaken to super-
intend the publication of the report, had stated to
the foreman in the office of the National Intelligen-
cer, that the appendix was to be attached to the
i eport On his i eturn to Wabhington on Monday,
Mr T was surprised to find the report of the
majority published without an appendix, while
the appendix designed for the minority report
was at ached to it He went to the office of the
National Intelhgencer for an explanation He there
learned that the appendix to the majority report
had been omitted by mistake It had now been
properly arranged, and the House would no doubt
have possession of it to-morrow Mr T said he
did not understand the motive for the introduction
of this small matter into this debate by the gentle-
man from Connecticut It could not ceitamly
affect the merits of the grave questions which the
House would soon be called to dehbeiate on
When they arose it would be time enough to enter
on this discussion
Mr E EVERETT wished, he said, to make a
shoit explanation in defence of individuals who
were absent, ind weie accused of negligence of
duty     He meant the public printers
Mi THOMAS explained that it was far from
his intention to mipule any negligence of duty to
the public prmte-s
Mr EVERETT did not undeistand any grave
charge to be made,  but that one was left to be
mferied It had not been oidered by the commit
tee that the journal should be pnnte.d It was
bent down with the appendix,¿nd the business of
Betting up the types of the journal was commenced
Happening to be at the punting office, he sug-
gested to the prmteis that it was not intended to
publish the journal, but told t! em not to rely upon
ins impression, but to consult one of the majority
of thecomm Uee This was done, and hibimpies-
sion was fully confiimed The fact was ascei-
lamed that tie jouual was not oideied to be
published By a subsequent determination, the
punter was ordered to punt the journal, and we
now had it on oui tables
The gentleman says that the appendix of the
leport of the majnuy would not sun that of the
minority lie did not know whether to considei
this remaik as exceptionable or not The appen
dix of the minority was not extracted fiom the
journal It wes a series of communications
between the two committees, ananged in clnono
logical order He had supposed that the oidei
and ruleof the House would i «quite both of tnese
reports to be printed in one pamphlet, whethei it
was so directed in the lc-olution or not The
views of the niinonty were a part of the report
He had been a member of two committees—the
retrenchment committee in 1828, and the commit-
tee on the appomonment bill, and he well íecol
lected that the views of the minority of those com
mittees formed a part of tne report He had
understood that, in 1828, the Clerk was requested
by the majority of the retienehment committee to
separate their i eport from that of the minority, but
he said it was a thing unheard otyand he tefused
to do it without the special order of the Speaker
The Speaker was applied to foi the order, and did
not give it Which ever way the question was
decided, the people should hear both sides from
him In order to facilitate his labor in sending
the reports to his constituents, he wished to have
but one pacicettoholdand butoneaddiess to write
Mr  THOMAS remarked, that it was errone-
ously supposed that he intended to reflect upon
the printer of the House    He tiad said that no
inconvenience had íesulted from his having given
a cony of the original report for publication, and
no en or had Leen committed by the printer of the
House n consequence of that cncumstance   The
public printer had a copy both of tne appendix
and the j jurnal, but he seemed to be at a loss to
conceive why the appendix  should  be printed,
as it consibted of extracts from the journal    This
error of the printer   had   not, as the gertleman j
fiom Connecticut supposed, grown out of the fact |
thai a copy of the repoit had been furnished to the I
Globe                                                                             ¡
Mr MANN said that having had something to
do with the transaction, he felt called upon to
explain what part he bore in it If there was any
error oi mistake at all on the subject, it had sprung
from two editorials in the Intelligencer, which he
regarded as idle and pestiferous wind, knowing
that as they applied to himself they were unmerit-
ed It became necessary that there should be a
copy of the original repoit, and that it should be
corrected for the press He was himself, in the
absence of the chairman, labouously engaged on
Friday in performing this duty When it was
completed, he carried the report and documents,
and the journal, to the office of the public printer
on Fiiday evening He did not find him there,
and the next morning he carried them again, and
left them with a person in the office Will the
public printer say that they had not the documents
in time to print them and lay them on our tables'
The pnntei,he al o said, knew very well that the
original report was in the hands of the clerk who
was, copying it, for he was there The young
man labored diligently until twelve o'clock on
Friday in the work, when he [Mr Mann] assist-
ed him to finish it, and corrected it in the Globe
The censure of the gentleman from Connecticut
must fall upon him foi the inconvenience which he
supposed the public printer to have suffered from
the detention of the papers
Mr ELLSWORTH said the gentleman was
wrong in supposing that he wished to cast any
censure on him He had spoken of a circum-
stance which to him appeared surprising, that a
document, which the House ordered to be printed
on Thuisday morning------
Mr MANN     Thuisday evening, sir
Mr ELLSWORTH On Thursday afternoon
It was surpnsing to him that the document then
ordeied to be printed, did not reach the public
printer till Saturday morning The original pa-
péis were taken away and detained till Saturday
It did appeal to him as if some pains had been
taken that the report should appear in the Globe,
without the correspondence and without the report
of the minority
Mr MILLER, said, that if the gentlemen had
all made their explanations, he would submit a
few remaiks, although he regietted to protract a
debateatthisimpoitantpeuodof the session As
related to the mistake that had occurred in regal d
to the printing of the appendix, annexed to the
repoit of the majority of the committee, he did
not believe that much censure ought to be attached
to any one He undei stood that some mistake had
occuired, by which the journal of the committee
had been blended unintentionally with the corre
spot dence between the committee of this House
and the representatives of the bank That it was
subsequently discovered,when the type wei e partly
set, and the correction of this error had caused the
delay Such mistakes may occur without any
bhme being attached to any person With regard
to the question immediately before the House,
that of ordering both documents to be punted in
one pamphlet, he viewed it as of very little ím
portance Toi himself, if they were punted sep
arately, he would send them both togethei to such
of his constituents as the number punted would
enable him to supply He was not afraid to trust
them with both sides of the question He pre
sumed that oth,er gentlemen would puisue the same
course
The present motion appeared to have no other
object than that of compelling members to send
them both together He thought this matter
might be ti usted to the discretion of gentlemen
themselves, and if members weredisposed to sepa-
rate them they could do so, notwithstanding they
were bound together with a small cord
In point of fact they weie separate documents
and had separate appendixes This he knew
when he made the motion, and that had induced
him to submit the motion in the form he had
He thought if the House punted an equal num-
ber of each report it ought to be sufficient to repel
the chaige of a disposition to print and circulate
partial infoimation at the expense of the nation
According to strict piihamentary proceedings, the
views of the minority were not considered a report,
and leave would have to be obtained to present them
to the House A different practice, however, had
prevailed m the House, and he was not disposed
to disturb it It was, perhaps, one that was
founded in good sense But as the reports were
separate and distinct documents, he could see no
obligation on the part of the House to unite
them The decision that the House might make
on the question was to him unimportant. He
would, therefore, not trespass on the attention of
the House
Mr BURGES was surprised, he said, that gen-
tlemen who considered this motion so unimportant,
should yet be so much opposed to it It was the
usage of the House to print in one view the reports
of every member of a committee The people
wished to have the truth, and the whole truth
No one could vote against this motion without
wishing to separate the allegations against the
bank directors from their defence, &c
Mr CHILTON supported the amendment of
Mr Briggs—when
Mr MILLER said he had no intention of
sending forth garbled information to the people
Wheie reports had been printed separately, as
was the case with the majonty and minority re-
poits of the Committee of Ways and Means the
present session, he had felt it his duty to send
them together He had no idea that his motion
would give use to so much debate, and was per-
fectly willing to accept the amendment as a modi-
fication of his motion
The question having been stated upon filling
the blank with the highest number proposed, —
thirty thousand—
Mi PINCKNEY was m favor of printing the
largest number of both reports, he was particu-
laily anxious that the minority report should be
extensively circulated, as it contained, as far as it
went, sound and constitutional views
Mr MASON inquired whether it was in order
to discuss the contents of either of the reports
upon the motion before the House >
The CHAIR replied,upon a question of print-
ing a document, the subject of it was open to dis-
cussion to a certain extent
Mr PINCKNEY proceeded- He wished to
assign his reasons for voting to print the largest
number They were, perhaps, not the same rea-
sons which would influence other members The
only objection he had against the report of the
minority was, that it did not go far enough in
its constitutional views, but it went far enough to
show the monstrous powers arrogated by thi
House, which involve the hbeities of the people
They will see in the measures which may be adopt
ed—unless the people themselves fly to the rescue—
the fetters which were forging for them, and i
they had a particle of regard for their liberties left
they would use and repel this attempt to subjugate
them He was anxious that the report of th«
minority of the committee might be extensively
i circulated in the State of Pennsylvania It was
I that State which had placed General Jackson in
the presidential chair He wished that State to
see this pioposition to prostrate her sovereignty
and drag fourteen of her most respectable citizens
¡ before the bar of this House Her citizens would
be able, by this attempt to degrade that State, to
understand the tyranny of the Administration
I The people of the State already know that every
class is involved in unpiecedented distress by its
measuies—they had  seen the attempt made by
the President to disgrace the Senate------■
|     The SPEAKER called the gentleman to order
Mr P said he was assigning the reasons why
he chould vote for printing the largest number of
this document Ihe citizens of Pennsylvania
might not know that it was now proposed to give
tins House power over the personal liberty of her
citizens They well knew their property was at
the disposal of Congress—they might not be aware
that their personal liberty was also at our disposal
They know that her meritorious sons, Messrs
Ingham and Duane, had been ignomimously dis-
missed from office without cause, but they may not
know that it was contemplated to drag fourteen
of hei most distinguished citizens as criminals
before this House He wished the people of that
State to read the reports and determine whether
they would permit this to be done—whether that
State will not interfere and rescue the personal
rights and hbeities of her citizens from being in-
vaded m the manner proposed------
The CHAIR interposed    This was a qaestion
