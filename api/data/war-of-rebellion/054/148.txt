Question. Was I not marching in the direction of the front to Wauhatchie, and did I not stop there when I had received your communication made to me?

Answer. I think I have stated and I will repeat that each time on meeting Colonel Hecker I found him marching, and I will, it was to the front and toward Wauhatchie.

Question. State the moment Colonel Hecker halted him column

Answer. I do not think I can give the exact moment of Colonel Hecker's halting his column, but I think it was just before his meeting General Hooker.

Question. By whom did you report that Colonel Hecker's brigade was stopped?

Answer. I cannot state positively that I reported by whom Colonel Hecker's brigade was stopped.

Question. Did you hear me mention at any time that I met swampy roads, or complaining about the roads over which I had passed?

Answer. I recollect no such complaints.

By the RECORDER:

Question. Was there anything either in the roads or in the ground adjoining the roads which would impede the passage of troops between where General Hooker and Colonel Hecker were, and where you met General Schurz?

Answer. The nature of the ground was such in several places, and a thicket in one place. I remember it was such in one place that it would impede troops in the night-time considerably.

Question. Where were these places which would have impeded troops in the night-time?

Answer. There was a portion of the ground which was boggy and had a thicket upon it of several rods in width which was near to the Tyndale Hill.

Question. What do you think is the distance between the place where you left General Hooker and the place where you met General Schurz?

Answer. I should think it somewhat more than a quarter of a mile.

By General SCHURZ:

Question. Did the two brigades march on the same road, namely, the Second Brigade, Second Division, and Colonel Hecker's brigade?

Answer. I think they marched upon the same road until within a quarter a mile of where I met General Hooker, at which point the Second Brigade, Second Division, turned to the left.

By the COURT:

Question. Do you know whether the Second Brigade, of General Steinwehr's division, preceded Colonel Hecker's brigade?

Answer. I am quite confident that it did, because it was pointed out to me at the time, somewhat in advance and considerably to the left flank of Colonel Hecker.

Question. At the time you met General Hooker with Colonel Hecker had the assault been made upon Smith's Hill by the Second Brigade, Second Division?

Answer. It had certainly been commenced.

Question. Did you know that General Steinwehr formed line of battle fronting Wauhatchie?
