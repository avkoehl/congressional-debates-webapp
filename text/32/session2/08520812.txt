JOHN WILSON, Acting Com. ad int.
Mr. DUNHAM. I move, Mr. Chairman, to
strike out " 1825." It seems to me that this case
can be presented in a few words, so that every
member will understand it. In 11S25, a treaty was
made with the Shawnees of Missouri, by which
they made certain cessions of their territory to
this Government, in return for which the United
States, among other things, agreed to convey to
them, in fee-simple, a tract of land fifty miles
square, lying west of the Mississippi, to be occu-
pied by themselves and such of the Ohio Shaw-
nees, a different and distinct band, as chose to
emigrate there and occupy it in common with
them. That whole fifty miles square was to be
conveyed by patent to the Missouri Shawnees.
The considerations for it moved from them, the
Shawnees of the Ohio not having anything in the
world to do with it. By this treaty the Shawnees
of Ohio had the right conceded, without paying
any consideration therefor, to go into that territory
nnd occupy it in common with the Shawnees of
Missouri, by whom, and not by the United States,
the right was conceded to them. Some years after-
wards, namely, in 1831, a treaty was made by the
United States with the Shawnees of Ohio, by
which the latter ceded their valuable lands in that
State to the Government.
The amount of the net proceeds of the sales of
those lands which came into the Treasury, is the
amount proposed to be given to those Indians by
the amendment which was adopted a few minutes
ago. The Government retained that amount on
condition that it was to convey to them one hun-
dred thousand acres of land in fee-simple for their
own exclusive occupancy and use within the fifty
miles square, which had been previously sold to
and paid for by the Missouri Shawnees, " but if
there should not be a sufficiency of good lands un-
occupied by the Shawnee Indians, (that is, the
Shawnees of Missouri,) who had already settled
on the tract:" then said one hundred thousand
acres was to be laid off on land contiguous thereto.
Well, then, if the one hundred thousand acres
have been conveyed to them out of that tract,
every lawyer in this committee must see that
the money retained from the Ohio Shawnees out
of the proceeds of the sale of their lands in Ohio i
was improperly retained, because the Shawnees of
Missouri had paid for the whole of that fifty miles
square in 1825; therefore the Government took that
money from the Ohio Shawnees without any con-
sideration whatever. It was a privilege granted to
them not by this Government, but by their breth-
ren of Missouri long before. But one hundred
thousand acres have not been and cannot be con-
veyed to them within said fifty miles square, ac-
cording to the terms of the treaty. The patent
which has been read is not a patent for one hun-
dred thousand acres in fee-simple to them for their
sole use and occupancy, but it is a patent to them
and the Shawnees of Missouri jointly, for the
whole fifty miles square, and only gives a right of
cooccupaucy which was theirs before. No man
can for a moment suppose that this fulfills the
treaty stipulation to give them one hundred thou-
sand acres in fee-simple for their sole use and oc-
cupancy, nor could the Government comply with
it by any attempt at a conveyance of land within
that fifty miles, for it had nothing left within it to
convey. It had long before parted with its whole
right and tide therein by the treaty with the Mis-
souri band. It has, therefore, retained this money
without any consideration, as it retained it under
pretense of giving what did not at the time
belong to it to give, and which already belonged
to the Indians by a previous treaty. True, the
Government might have given the one hundred
thousand acres out of contiguous lands, but it has
never done so, and as it has since conveyed to
other tribes the best if not all the good lands con-
tiguous, and as the Indians have, by its own act,
become settled where they had a right to settle,
with their brethren of Missouri, it is but just that
it should now leave them there and pay to them
this money, and I think this course much better
for the Indians.
Mr. HOWARD. The gentleman from Indiana
has a singular idea of the law of real property,
and I am at a loss to know where he has derived
his learning. In the first place, the treaty of 1825
vests in the Missouri Shawnees and those of Ohio
a certain tract of country. The gentleman says
that the patent was to be issued to the Missouri
Shawnees exclusively. That is a mistake.
Mr. DUNHAM. The gentleman misunder-
stood me, if he so understood me. I did not say
that the patent was to be issued to the Shawnees
of Missouri exclusively; I said that the consider-
ation for that whole land moved entirely from the
Shawnees of Missouri, and the other patent was
to the Ohio Shawnees.
Mr. HOWARD. The gentleman is at fault all
around. The title vested by force of treaty has
been tested in similar cases in the Supreme Court
of the United States in at least twenty cases, and
it has been decided in the supreme court of Ohio, I
that a patent was not necessary where the land
was granted by law. What is the legal effect of
the treaty of 1831 ? In order to have divested any
right which accrued to these Indians under the
treaty of 1825, it would have been necessary for |
the treaty of 1831 to have stated expressly their โข
title to all except one hundred thousand acres is !
hereby relinquished and divested. It does not con-
tain any such provision. When these Indians went
there they had a right to demand a division, and if
there had not been one hundred thousand acres
left to them within the grant, then the Government
ought to have made it up. When they arrived
there, instead of that they saw that the treaty of
1825 gave them eight hundred thousand acres, and
therefore they did not call for a division, settled as
one tribe, and elected to take as tenants in com-
mon under the treaty of 1825. Any lawyer who
reads the patent will see that it is issued in entire
conformity with the treaty stipulations of 1825.
What is the ground of all this claim ? They have
not only got one hundred thousand acres, but they
have received nearly eight times that quantity, and
you now attempt to give a construction to the
treaty under the pretense of giving them ยง66,000,
which, if it had any effect upon the title, would
divest them of their property. To make this ap-
propriation without some explanation in the act,
is to cast a cloud over the title of the Ohio Shaw-
nees, and will in all probability lead to a conflict,
if not to a civil war in the tribe, as to who are the
owners of the land, when both branches of the
tribe are tenants in common.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. DUNHAM. I will withdraw my amend-
ment by unanimous consent.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I object.
The question was then taken on Mr. Dunham's
amendment, and it was not agreed to.
Mr. HALL. I move a pro forma amendment.
It is not my purpose to discuss the merits of the
amendment offered by thegentleman from Indiana,
[Mr. Fitch.] Whether it is proper to appropri-
ate $66,000 to these Shawnees, or not, is not the
question now before the committee. Thegentle-
man from Texas [Mr. Howard] proposed to add
to the amendment already adopted by this com-
mittee, that nothing in that amendment shall be
construed to affect the rights secured to the In-
dians under the treaty of 1825 and 1831. Let us
see how that amendment, if adopted, will operate
under the treaty of 1825. The Indians acquired
the right to a certain tract of land west of the
State of Missouri, for the benefit of both the Mis-
I souri and Ohio Shawnees. There is no doubt
about that. But in 1831 we stipulated that these
Ohio Shawnees should receive one hundred thou-
sand acres of land to themselves. Now they come
here and say this : that, by the act of 1825, they
1 acquired a joint interest with the Missouri Shaw-
nees in this tract of country west of the State of
Missouri. They say, therefore, that by the treaty
of 1831, they were entitled to something more
. than that, and that they cannot have without
taking land outside of these limits; and hence the
committee, recognizing the claim of the Shawnees,
have agreed to give them $66,000. If you adopt
the amendment of the gentleman from Texas,
why, these Indians may come up next year and
say that they have still precisely the same rights
to one hundred thousand acres of land that they
now have, although you paid them ยง66,000, be-
cause the proviso says that this shall not impair
their rights to an}' land secured to them by the act
of 1831. Now they say that the lands secured to
I them by the treaty of 1831, are not within the fifty
I miles square granted to the Missouri Indians in
1825, but outside of that. I am willing to accord
to the Indians every right which they acquired by
the treaty of 1825; but it does appear to me, that
if you adopt the proviso so as to secure them the
right under the treaty of 1831, you give them
$66,000 for nothing in the world.
; The object of giving this $66,000 is to buy out
the right of the Indians to what they claim under
the treaty of 1831, and if you do not extinguish
the right granted by that act, this appropriation is
a mere gratuity for which this Government re-
ceives no consideration whatever. I am not willing
to appropriate this money in this way. If the In-
dians have received really all they were entitled to
by the treaties of 1825 and 1831, you ought not to
appropriate a dollar. If they have not received one
hundred thousand acres of land under the treaty
of 1831, then they are entitled to pay for it. This
$66,000 is given to pay them for those rights
secured to them in the treaty of 1831, and yet the
gentleman proposes in the very next breath in
which this money is appropriated for that purpose
that we are to provide it shall not go to extinguish
the rights under the treaty of 1831.
Mr. HOWARD. It is not my fault if the ap-
propriation is made to a wrong state of facts.
There is no evidence yet produced in the case that
these Indians have not been able to get their one
hundred thousand acres. On the contrary, the
whole tract comprises one million six hundred
thousand acres, of which, being about half of the
whole tribe, they are entitled to a moiety. The
evidence is conclusive that if they had called for a
division, they could have obtained the one hun-
dred thousand acres. It was not their interest to
pursue that course. It is perfectly conclusive, from
the papers in the case, that when they get there,
their friends recommended them to mingle with
the Missouri Shawnees, and not to call for a di-
vision. That was the advice of the surveyor. So
far, therefore, from saying that they did not get
the one hundred thousand acres, the reverse is
true. Under the treaty of 1825, they are to have
the land in fee-simple, so long as they continue
to reside on and occupy it. Every lawyer will see
at once that the tenantcy in both cases is precisely
the same, and in no respect different. The title
under the treaty of 1831, is one hundred thousand
acces in fee-simple so long as they occupy it. In
each case the tenure is the same. There is, there-
fore, no foundation for the claim, in my estima-
tion, and it seems to me to be wrong. If you
give them the money, give it to them as a do-
nation, and not under the pretense that they have
no title to the land. It is not true as a legal prop-
osition, and the practical effect of such a construc-
tion by us can be only to produce dissensions and
difficulties in the tribes as to the title and owner-
ship of the land.
Mr. HALL. I withdraw my amendment.
Mr. MEADE. I move to strike out the sum
named, and insert 850,000.
The CHAIRMAN. Nothing can be stricken
