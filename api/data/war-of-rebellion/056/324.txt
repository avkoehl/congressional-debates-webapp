Upon information of any attack in force threatened there, your garrison at Pocahontas must push on to Corinth, and you must move yourself, and that rapidly. A few days will bring forces to Columbus which will clear the upper country down to Jackson. Ascertain from prisoners and all other sources the probable strength of the enemy.

General Grierson:

My latest information of the position of the enemy was that he was moving from Grand Junction toward or to the south of Saulsbury. Artillery is reported as having been heard to the southeast of here about one-half hour ago.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Colonel Hurst, at Grand Junction, informed me by courier about 5 this morning that the enemy was moving on him in strong force. I directed him to fall back on this place if too strong for him. Have just learned that the enemy is falling back toward Saulsbury, and that Hurst is pursuing.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Major Whitsit, in command of detachment of Ninth and Sixth Illinois, just arrived from Saulsbury. The enemy did not capture any trains, but tore up the road for some distance, burned tied, and bent rails; but no very serious damage. Hatch skirmished with them two or three hours this morning, and they have retreated south. Will send you more definite information as soon as possible. Force reported about 2,000. Nothing heard from Tuttle or Mizner.
