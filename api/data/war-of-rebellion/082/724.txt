HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,July 31, 1864.

General Turner's division is en route to City Point.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,July 31, 1864-8.45 a.m.

Major General E. O. C. ORD, Eighteenth Corps:

Turner was not ordered to be sent to City Point. He was ordered here. The copy of the telegram I sent you is all right on this point. I have headed off Turner and he is now here in person.

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,July 31, 1864.

General MEADE:

The state of Burnside's front required I should leave two divisions, colored and Stannard's, in Burnside's trenches. They were to be sent me to-night. Have not come. If Turner leaves I have but Ames left. Can your order Burnside to send me Carr's division at once?*

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS,July 31, 1864-3 a.m.

General MEADE:

Burnside reports it almost impossible to relieve either of my divisions to-night; hopes to do so to-morrow night. As he is so reduced would it not be well to give Warren some of his front?

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-general.

JULY 31, 1864-8 a.m.

General ORD:

Were your men all relieved last night and returned to you?

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS,July 31, 1864-8.40 a.m.

General MEADE:

Two brigades of First (Burnham's) Division came back this morning, enough to prevent enemy thinking from the two moves of Hancock and Turner out of trenches that we were evacuating. General Turner's division has gone to City Point.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
