Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS,

Devall's Bluff:

The scout returned this morning, having been thirty miles south. The only information obtained was that parties of the enemy, from twenty-five to fifty strong, were hovering in that vicinity. Officers of Colonel Clark's command returning from Austin state that they were informed the prisoners were sent to Augusta.

Very respectfully,

ADOLPH ENGELMANN,

Colonel Forty-third Illinois.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, August 27, 1864.

Captain SELLS:

It is rumored Shelby is moving into Missouri west of Black River. If so, he may throw a force toward Bloomfield to divert attention. Send scouts toward the Saint Francis south and west of you early to-morrow and keep me posted of any movements. Do not be surprised, and instruct the parties you send out to act cautiously.

H. M. HILLER,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
