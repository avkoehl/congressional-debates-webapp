A few words more, before he concluded The Whig party
came into power, promising to restore confidence to the coun-
try, to reg > i !aie the exchanges, and bring about universal pros
penty Hjw had these promises been kept? Instead of
restoring confidence, the? had, by repealing the «iub
ireasury and giving aid to insolvent banks, fixed
upon the country an incurable curse, in the shape
of irredeemable paper currency instead of brmemg pros
penty to the country, they had, as they all knew, brought it
to the verge of bankruptcy, causing disasters that it would
take many years of (he mild and beneficent rule of Democracy
to remove Thank God, the day star was breaking upon us
Thank God that he saw the dawn of better days for the country,
and that a spmt was roused among the people that would, eie
long, sweep away the last vesti%e of corruption and misrule
from our beloved country. He had no intention of pressing
this subject lurther. He could, if time permuted, enlarge upon
it, much to his own satisfaction and the satisfaction of his con
stitueots, and was confident, if he did so, that it would meet
thPir approbation He did not, when he obtained the floor, la
tend to say half as much as hp had done, but when once up,
many subjects pressed themselves on hia attention, which he
could not refrain from giving a passing notice, though he had
done son rather a desultot y manner He would, theiefSre, in
conclusion, merely say that it would give him pleasure to \oto

to doso consistently with his views of what the honor and inte

tect who should weaken the foundation of his building just in
the same propoition as he increased the weight of the super-
structure?   The most tioughtless would see that m the end the
whole must sink in rums, and yet his folly would not be greater
than that committed m the construction ef our monetary sys-
tem, undet the fall of which so many of the most enterprising

But as haid and as unmerited as heiegarded their fate, he
could not comply with tHe request of the respectable signers
of the remonstrance which he had usen to present He feared
that the act, if permuted to go into opeiation, would increase,
ratherthandimmish, theamountof distress It might, indeed,
shift it from one class of citizens to another, but with an in-
ciease, rather than a mm^ati  n, of the evil Without pretend-
ing to trace conspquencesm detail, hp would make a few re
marks explanatory of what he believed would be its effects in
this connection Ne one estimated the amount of pioperty
which must be broueht under the hammer of the auctioneer,
should the act go i to operation, at les'* than one hundred mil
lions of dohars "Where, he would ask, is the money to be
* found to make this mighty transfer of property, without im-
mense sacrifice to all concerned, and a universal depression of
the puce of proper'y ail over the country? And what, he
would again ask, would be the effects on trade and
business, of withdrawing so large a portion of the money
of the country, as would be required to make the transferí
Could the sound banks stard its operation? Woulá
they not again suspend, and who could describe the calamitous
effects which must follow? Add to this, the incalculable waste
of property m tire hands of the trustees of insolvent estates,
from ignorance mdiff íencc frauds, peculations, and the rapa*
cious chñisea of attorneys an 1 officeis, and some idea may be
formed of the extent of the disuess which must follow this
mistaken attempt to relieve the dMrcsed On this point, we
are not witnout experience Under the former bankrupt act,
not a centscaice'y was ever di/ided among the creditors efthe
insolvent and what "fis m^ble hope can there be of amore fa
vorable result under t¡ e pre em?
But I have ««till -trorger objections agams* complying wiih
the reque t of those who have selected me as ihe organ
through which to piesent this ien onstrance I believe
the act to be unconstitutional, as far as it piopises to
comprehend the ca^e of insolvent debtors According
to my conception, the power conferred by the Con
«Utution, is limited to bankruptcy, in contradistinction to
insolvency It is well known, that they constituted (as they
still do) two distinct and separate chapter* in the code of British
laws, at the time the Cinatitution was adopted They both, in*
deed, grow out of the relation of debtoi and creditoi—-butout
of distinct aspees of that relation Bankruptcy looks to the in-
terests of the creditor, and always originates with him Its oh
iect is to secure his merest On the other hand insolvency
locks to the debtor, and originates with him and has for its ob-
ject fo relieve the hone t, but unfortunate debtor, who has be
come mcap?ble of plying his debts The one takes Us source in
the po icy of tnde, and th*1 other m the dictates of humanity.
The States, in oelegatmg the former, tetainedthe latter, as pait
of then reserved poweib wuch in his opinion they are as fully
comt etent to exercise now, 3s *hey weie before the adoption of
the Cons ¡tution The idea that ihe powers of this Government
extended to insolvency, a^ well as bankruptcy, is of i ccent on
gin Ifhedid not mistake it did not date back farther than 1827,
and then it was opposed by all the oithodox members of this
botlyofthe school to which he belong1', with few exceptions
But he exprés ed his opinion fully on this subject a few eessiors
iso, and would not now dwell longer on it
lam, said Mr C in conclusion, one of those who have
such reverence for the Constitution, that I shall never consent
to stretches powers to i emedy any canicular evil, however
great or urgent In thusrigidlv adhering to its letter, lam go
verned not oily by the dictate^ ol conscience, but the highest
principles o*" humanity, fhr I solemnly believe, that on a scru
pulous adhPience to its piovisionsdepends the duration of our
system of C ivernment, and on that the balety and happiness ef
ourselves and our posterity But if my opinions were less ri
gid and I would be induced to ieiax in any case, one of the
veiy last in which I could be induced to do so,
would be to s íe ch its powers over the all prevailing rela-
tion of debtors and credifors I see dangers thick and
fearful m extending the powers, of this Government, overthe
wtde extent of that relation Already we witness attempts
after att^mf *3 n t^is Chamber, to extend it fai beyond ihe
extent of tl u relition as between individuals by embracing
política  bodies incotporited by the fetateb, and that, too, on
piinupie^ which, if once admitted, would, in my opinion,
override the anthouty of the fetites, ana give this Government
a vtrtual snpfrrib'on of a!! their acts With a construction
far Ieas forced, than (hat wtwh would admit such principles,
th's Government might buns into the voittx nf a Bankrupt
