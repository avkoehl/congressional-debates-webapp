HEADQUARTERS ENGINEER BRIGADE, March 31, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have just been informed that the four officers ordered to report to Captain McAlester to superintend the erection of batteries have, trough some mistake, not yet left. Must they go to-night? I would say that this will leave four companies of that regiment without officers-Ninety-sixth U. S. Colored Infantry. The detached officers from the Ninety-sixth and Ninety-seventh that I requested to have returned to their regiments have not yet arrived, consequently they are short of officers.

Respectfully,

J. BAILEY,

Brigadier-General.
