LITTLE ROCK, May 9, 1864-9 a.m.

Colonel W. R. JUDSON, Commanding, Fort Smith:

General Thayer's division left here two days ago for Fort Smith. He leaves here himself to-day, and will go by boat to Dardanelle. You will concentrate your forces in Fort Smith, and hold the place until re-enforcements arrive. Colonel Lynde, Ninth Kansas Cavalry, is here; his regiment is ordered to remain at Clarksville until further orders. Keep scouts out so as to hear of the approach of Thayer's troops.

By order of Major General F. Steele:

W. D. GREEN,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO., May 9, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING:

When will the re-enforcements for Bloomfield reach here? What do you think of evacuating Dallas and sending the force there to Bloomfield? Would afford more protection to that country than a weak one at Dallas. I could nearly as well feed them at Bloomfield as Dallas, since both have to be fed from here. The quartermaster says he cannot feed any more than are now out unless he has more transportation. But for this I would send another squadron from here.

J. B. ROBERS,

Colonel, Commanding.
