OFFICE OF CHIEF ENGINEER,

DEPARTMENT OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,

September 10, 1862.

Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: I have the honor to ask your consideration of an important question in connection with the obstructions that have been placed in the James River at Drewry's Bluff, viz: The leaving of a pass -way for our gun-boats and floating batteries to go below the works. It is possible to provide such a pass-way, to be closed by a movable obstruction on the approach of superior naval forces of the enemy; but such an arrangement will be by no means so safe as to have all parts of the work fixed and immovable. A storm or a freshet might occur at the time when it became necessary to close the opening, rendering it impossible to maneuver the movable parts, or the occurence of storm or freshet might sweep away these less stable parts at any time prior to the hour of danger, and not allow sufficient time to replace them. The replacement in the presence of an enemy would be an impossibility, and under any circumstances would require more time than would be needed to remove a portion of the fixed a portion of the fixed works sufficient to give passage
