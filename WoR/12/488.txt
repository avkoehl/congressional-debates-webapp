
and removed from my observation. Its loss was 8 killed, 70 wounded, including the colonel, and 37 missing.* It was under fire from morning until night.

Since writing the above I have obtained the following return of casualties:

Fifth Regiment, Colonel Starr, commanding.-Killed, 2 lieutenants, 7 non-commissioned officers and privates; wounded, 1 colonel, 1 captain, 7 lieutenants, 58 non-commissioned officers and men; missing, 28 non-commissioned officers and men.*

Sixth Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel John P. Van Leer commanding.-Killed 1 lieutenant-colonel, 1 lieutenant, 37 non-commissioned officers and privates; wounded, 4 captains, 3 lieutenants, 71 non-commissioned officers and privates; missing, 26 non-commissioned officer and privates.*

Seventh Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel E. A. Carman commanding.-Killed, 1 lieutenant, 26 non-commissioned officers and privates; wounded, 1 lieutenant-colonel,3 captains,5 lieutenants,and 77 non-commissioned officers and privates; missing, 9 non-commissioned officers and privates.*

Eighth Regiment, Colonel Adolphs J. Johnson commanding.-Killed, 1 major, 1 lieutenant, and 34 non-commissioned officers and privates; wounded,1 colonel,4 captains,6 lieutenants,and 114 non-commissioned officers and privates; missing, 4 non-commissioned officers and privates.*

Recapitulation.-Killed, wounded, and missing, 2 colonels, 2 lieutenant-colonels, 1 major, 12 captains, 25 subalterns, and 456 con-commissioned officers and privates; aggregate,498.*

The loss of the service of Colonel Johnson and Lieutenant-Colonels Van Leer and Carman and Major Ryerson is a very serious one in so far as the future service of the brigade is concerned. They had the respect and confidence of their commands and proved they well deserved it. I have yet to learn if the brigade can be handled in evolutions of the line with such a destitution of field officers. To risk a reputation so dearly earned without them, until those taking their place have learned their duties, would be injustice.

I append hereto a list of casualties.*

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
