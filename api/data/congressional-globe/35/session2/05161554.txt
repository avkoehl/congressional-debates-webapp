for the free and exclusive use of actual settlers;
"Which was ordered to lie on the table.
Mr. CRITTENDEN, presented the petition of
Tal. P. Shaffner, praying that the President, or
the Secretary~c>f the Navy, may be authorized to
render him such aid as may be practicable in car-
rying out his plans for laying a telegraph between
Europe and America, via Greenland, Iceland, and
the Faroe Isles, by permitting the Government
ships to transport his surveying party; which
â– was referred to the Committee on Naval-AfFairs.

in the public works; which was ordered to lie on
the table.
PAPERS WITHDRAWN.
On motion of Mi*. JONES, it was
Ordered, That Vnginia Waldron have leave to withdraw

COAST SURVEY REPORT.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Some* days ago I made a
motion to reconsidcr the vote by which the Sen-
ate ordered five thousand extra copies of the
coast survey report to be printed. I should like
to have that motion disposed of, and I ask for its
consideration now. I shall not discuss it. I sim-
ply desire to have the estimate of the expense of
the publication, which is on the Secretary's table,
read; and to have the yeas and nays on the ques-
tion of printing the extra numbers.
Mr. FITCXi. I must object to the present con-
sideration of that. Here is my desk loaded with
reports which must be made. If the gentleman
chooses to throw a difficulty in the way by insist-
ing upon his motion on so trifling a matter, and
yet which is doing injustice to the public service,
he alone is responsible.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Does the Senator
from Indiana insist on the regular order of busi-
ness ?
Mr. FITCH. I do.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I make the motion to test
the sense of the Senate.
Mr. CRITTENDEN. I desire to present a
petition.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I give way for that pur-
pose.
Mr. CRITTENDEN presented a petition,
which is given above.
MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE.
A message from the House of Representatives,
by Mr. Allen, its Clerk, announced that the
House had passed a bill (No. 890) making an ap-
propriation for the payment of the expenses of
investigating committees of the House of Repre-
sentatives; in which the concurrence of the Senate
was requested.
REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
Mr. BAYARD. The Committee on the Judi-
ciary, to whom was referred a petition of citizens
of San Francisco city and county, relative to the
SantiHan grant, have instructed me to ask that
they be discharged from its further consideration.
The committee have had no time to give the
whole matter that consideration to which it is en-
titled; but their inclination is that some bill, not
such as is contemplated by the petition, buta bill
which shall not violate general principles, might
be fiumed to guard the lntcvcntsof the petitioners
without trespassing on the rights of others. At
another session, it jnay be in the power of the
committee to report such a bill in time to prevent
injury; but at this time it would be useless to
hope for the passage of such a bill, even if its de-
tails could be perfected. I move, therefore, that
the committee be discharged from the further
consideration of the subject.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr.BAYAR.D. Tin; same committee, to whom
was referred the bill (fl. It. No. 886) to protect
timber growing upon lands of the United States
reserved for mihtaiy and other purposes, have
.directed me to repoit it back with a recommend-
ation that it pass, and ask for its present consid-
eration. It is a bill to which, I think, there can
be no objection. The object is to provide, by
penal enactment, against the cutting and stealing
of timber from military reservations, which has
been found to be, from the statements-of the De-
partment, a growing evil. It can injure no one;
it is for the purpose of protecting the timber on
the military reservations of the United States. I
hope the bill will be considered at once. I think
it can be passed in two minutes.
Mr. FITCH. I must interpose an objection
to any motion to consider anything except what
is strictly in order.
Mr. BAYARD. Can the objection of a single
Senator prevent the consideration of the bill at
the presenttime>if a majority of the Senate choose
to take it up, it being a bill reported back after its
second reading?
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Fitzpat-
rick in the chair.) The bill having been just
reported cannot be considered to-day, objection
having been made.
Mr. STUART, from the Committee on Public
Lands, to whom was referred the bill (S. No. 559)
to ratify and confirm certain entries of the public
lands in Alabama, under the act of August 4,
1854, reported it with an amendment.
He also, from the same committee, to whom
was referred the petition of A. Edwards, reported
a bill (S. No. 607) to provide for the final settle-
ment of the accounts of Abram Edwards, late
receiver of the land office at Kalamazoo, Michi-
gan ; which was read, and passed to a second read-
ing.
Mr. STUART. As the bill which I have just
reported simply provides for the adjustment of
accounts as they were certified in 1849, and thfe
the payment of a small balance to a very old and
worthy gentleman, I wish to ask the indulgence
of the Senate to pass it now.
Mr. FITCH. I must object, as I have some
reports to make. I should not be so urgent but
for the fact that the inflexible Senator from Vir-
ginia [Mr. Hunter] will insist at twelve o'clock
on the regular order.
Mr. HUNTER, from the Committee on Fi-
nance, to whom was referred the bill (H. R. No.
713) malcing'appropriations for sundry civil ex-
penses of the Government for the year ending
30th of June, 18G0, reported it with amendments,
and gave notice that at twelve o'clock he would
cad it up.
Mr. CLAY, from the Committee on Com-
merce, to whom was icfened the bill (S. No. 568)

ernment piers at Chicago to use the same for
commercial purposes, and keep the same in re-
pair, asked to be discharged from its further con-
sideration; which was agreed to.
Mr. PEARCE, from the Committee on the
Library, who were instructed by a resolution of
the Senate to report what progress has beenmade
in completing the publication of the exploiing ex-
pedition under Captain Wilkes, what amount of
appropriations for the work remain unexpended,
and what amount will be necessary to complete
the same, submitted a report on the subject; which
\fras ordered to be printed.
Mr. FITCH, from the Committee on Printing,
to whom was referred the joint resolution (S. No.
11) relating to the public printing, asked to be
discharged from its further consideration; which
was agreed to.
Mr. FITCH. _The same committee, to whom
was referred the memorial of Pryorte Heiss, pro-
prietors of the States, praying that steps be taken
to enforce the provisions of the act of 3d of March,
1845, in relation to the publication of proposals
for contracts, have instructed me to report that,
if the statements of the memorialists be sustained
on investigation, legislation will very probably
be necessary; but they ask to be^liseharged from
its further consideration at this time, for want of
time to examine it', i make that motion.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. PITCH, from the same committee, to whom
was referred the memorial of William Pettibone

discharged from its further consideration; which
was agreed to.

was recommitted the motion to print the letter of

ably be abolished. And the committee were the
