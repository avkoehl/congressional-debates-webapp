BALLOON IN THE AIR,

May 1, 1863-11 a. m.

Major-General SEDGWICK,

Commanding Left Wing, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I can see no earthworks on the Bowling Green road.

Should judge that the guns had been taken from the earthworks to the right of Fredericksburg.

Another train of wagons is moving to the right, on a road about 1 mile from beyond the heights opposite Franklin's crossing.

The enemy's barracks, opposite Banks' Ford, are entirely deserted.

The largest column of the enemy is moving on the road toward Chancellorsville. The enemy on the opposite heights, I judge, considerably diminished.

Can see no change under the heights and in the rifle-pits.

I can see no diminution in the enemy's tents.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. S. C. LOWE,

Aeronaut.
