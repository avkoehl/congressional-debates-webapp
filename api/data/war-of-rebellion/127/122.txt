In order to aid him in the discharge of this important duty, I herewith transmit the names of the several officers appointed by me and the positions severally assigned to them, designating such as have received a military education and have been in the public service; also such as have had military experience without a military education. *

All the lieutenant who have not been designated as having received a military education are highly recommended as young gentlemen of character and as well qualified. Some of them are personally known to the Secretary of War. All the foregoing appointments have been conscientiously made, with due regard to the qualifications of the appointees, and have been as well distributed through the State as circumstances would allow. If not inconsistent with the views of the President and Secretary of War and their duty to the public service, it would be a source of gratification to the persons appointed and to me that they should be allowed to retain the positions assigned them, or receive such other appointment as the President shall deem proper.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. B. MOORE.

THE HONORABLE THE PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF THE CONVENTION OF THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA:

In pursuance of my appointment by your body as commissioner to the State of Delaware, I have visited Dover, the capital of that State, and, to the best of my ability, discharged the trusts you confided to me. On my way thither, at Washington City I learned from those most competent to give information the state of public sentiment in Delaware in regard to questions connected with the object of my mission; that a large majority of the people were aggrieved at the aggressions of the Northern upon the Southern States; that their sympathies and interests were with the latter, and that on the withdrawal of Virginia and Maryland from the United States, Delaware would unquestionably follow them and unite her destinies with the Confederate States of the South. I learned also that the Legislature of the State, then in session, was not regarded as a true exponent of the sentiments of the people on these points, and was advised to address myself to the Executive. On reaching Dover I found that one branch of the Legislature, the Senate, had a majority of one known and recognized as Democrats, and the other branch a majority of one, though not elected such, called and regarded as Republicans. After a long social and satisfactory interview with His Excellency Governor Burton, and a consultation with a number of the leading and prominent men of the State most friendly to the objects of my mission, all of whom concurred in the opinion that the objects I had in view would be most promoted by addressing myself to the Executive, I concluded to make no application for a hearing before the Legislature. Accordingly I addressed a communication to the Governor setting forth the objects of my mission and briefly discussing the advantages that would result to Delaware by her union with a Southern Confederacy, and inclosed therein the documents I had been instructed to lay before the constituted authorte.
