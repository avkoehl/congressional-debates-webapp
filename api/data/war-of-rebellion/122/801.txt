this State. Those regiments which have not yet a minimum number of men are authorized to fill up, which is being effected very slowly. Should our army advance to Southern or Southwestern Kentucky they will recruit very rapidly. There are no other than three-years' men enlisted in this State. These regiments and factions of regiments are either in the field, or will be in the course of this month, save two or three fractional ones.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAML. GILL,

Acting Adjutant-General.
