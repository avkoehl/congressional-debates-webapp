Major-General HUMPHREYS:

MAY 13, 1864.

[General G. K. WARREN:]

GENERAL: I directed the picket-line to be relieved with some show. The enemy was closely observed. He has not left my front. All along his line the men are discharging their muskets to clean them. A row of fires is visible along his intrenchments. He has strengthened his picket-line. Last night the left of mine was driven back. Shall I still send out a force? The battery last established threw shell into the right of my pits last night.

Very respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

[Firt indorsement.]

The position referred to by Crawford is the one occupied yesterday by the enemy in front of Warren.

MEADE,

Major-General.
