Mr CLAY remarked, that lie said at the time the act was pass-
edj that it wife in the power of Oongrc&s to repeal it, and it wab,
in his opinion, the platform upon which the country then stood,
and the means by which the country was restored to brotheily
affection and union, and it had the sanction of all manufactu-
rers exrept, aa he observed at that time, political manufactu
rers He assumed the Senator from South Carolina that when
this subject should be taken up, he meant to discuss um that
spirit of duty to the country and m that spirit of Uuthandgcnu
me patriotism, by which he had always endeavoied to regulate
hia whole conduct on this and all other questions of pubhe im-
portance He moved that the memorial be íeferred to the Com-
mittee on Manufactuies
Mr CALHOUN regietted that the Senator had thought proper
to make any reply to the remarks he (Mr Calhoun) had made
He did not intend what he had =<aid fói arguments, but merely
wished to state^the grounds on which he had acted, and did
not think hts remarks called forreply But since the Senator
had thought propei to reply to him, it became nesessary to
make a few additional remarks in answer He did not a¿ree
with the Senator that there was a necessity for going beyond
twenty per cent or to violate tlie compromise act If it was done
it wouldnotbe awoik of necessity, but of choice Surrender
the land fund, lop off the additional estimate* for the year, and
introduce a rigid system of retrenchment and economy, do all
that, and the Senatoi will find much less than twenty per cent
would be required to furnish ample means foi conducting the
affans^f the Government on a liberal scale, leaving a sufficient
urplus to pay off the debt m the course of a few years
As to the statement of the benatoi that the tamt of 1824 and
that oí 1828 were opposed on the ground that they would dimi
msb, and not mciease the revenue, he would find, on revi rtmg to
the speeches on the occasion, ti athe ísgieatly mibUken Such
consequences might be attnbuted to the sy-,tnn itself if carried
out to the extent which his friends at that time < ontemplated
He must remember the detlaiation frequently made at the time,
and by himself imong others that the protective toysiem would
not be completely carried out till every aiticle that could be
produced at home should be piohibited iiom abvoad If
carried to that extent, the effect? would ha* e been a
great reduction oí revenue from imports, and a re
sou to internal taxes, as was (then predicted But it
would be a gieat mistake to suppose that the revenue would not
increase wita the mc-ieas* of duties if smuggling and frauds
could be avoided, m piopoition to the amount ol the imports
If, for instance, anavetage duty ol 30.40, oi 50 per cent belaid
on any amount of impoits, it would yield a coi responding
amount ui revenue, if there be no fraud or bmugghn * High
duties would, indeed, teduce the exports., and, by consequence,
the impoit5 , in the long íun, and thus, reduce the anvmnt of re
venue i rom any given rite of duty In confirmation of this he
referred to ihe fact that the revenue did rise with the increased
duties of 1828 lie would state that, under the tat iff ol 1828, the
average duty on the a agrégate of impoits, lncmdm? free and
all, wv. little shoit of 50 nei cent and the amount of gio<*sie-
venue wa¡> upwaids ol thnty one million-,, on an impoiutiou ol
about *nxty ioui millions
Althatvtiy time, the expeu lituus of the Govern nent not
including the debt, were about hfteen millions, ami ti  te wis i
surplus at once, contraiy to the declaration of the senator ol
fifteen millions beyond thb ordinaiy wants of iht. Government,
after the debt was paid It was this sui plus, after the disehar„(
of the debt, togethei with the necessaiy operation of tin emu
mous taníí of 3828 that caused thu expulsion of the enrrency
which caused the apt culation in tbo public land% and mcieastd
sogreatlv the íeveuue from that qimrtei It was but the effects
of the protective system Had that system never been adopted,

that he had not yet seen that report The measure itself waa
the most important of the &ession, and an opportunity should,
therefore, be afforded to scrutinize the report, before it was pre
