General EASTON,

Kinston Bridge:

I am sending wagons down for the supplies, and shall put a regiment at work at this end. Look to increasing the transportation by water up Neuse River as near Kinston as possible and we can haul from there. This to be in excess of the capacity of the railroad. All my army is now here and coming in.

Major-General.

Colonel WRIGHT,

Morehead City:

Report to me the condition of the railroad. Employ at any cost laborers to put both the Wilmington and New Berne branches in order. Hire three gangs at each point, to work each eight hours, calling it a day, so that you may do three days' work in twenty-four hours. My army is now coming in and all will be here to-day and to-morrow. I was much disappointed that this was not already done. Cars must carry into Kinston at once supplies. I will put an engineer regiment at once to work from this end. You can have as many details as you want. Expedition is the thing.

Brigadier General L. C. EASTON,

Chief Quartermaster, Morehead City:

GENERAL: I have made junction of my armies at Goldsborough a few days later than I appointed, but I find neither railroads completed, nor have I a word or sign from you or General Beckwith of the vast stores of supplies I hoped to meet here or hear of. We have sent wagons to Kinston in hopes to get something there, but at all events I should know what has been done and what is being done. I have constantly held out to the officers and men to bear patiently the want of clothing and other necessaries, for at Goldsborough awaited us everything. If you can expedite the movement of stores from the sea to the army, do so, and don't stand on expenses. The reshould always be three details of workers, of eight hours each, making twenty-four hours per day of work on every job, whether building a bridge, unloading vessels, loading cars, or what not. Draw everything you need from Savannah, Port Royal, Charleston, &amp;c., for this emergency, and don't let the delay we had at Savannah recur. Remember that we want the stores and nothing else. We don't want a pemanent establishment at Morehead city, at New Berne, or here. Our wagons are our store-houses. I must be off again in twenty days, with wagons full, men reclad, &c.

Yours, truly,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
