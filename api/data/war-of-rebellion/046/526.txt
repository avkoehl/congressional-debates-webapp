Malloy, Company D, acted with conspicuous coolness and bravery, and was severely wounded in the neck near the close of the action. Lieutenant W. F. Murphy, Company K, acted well during the engagement. Captain W. R. Bell, Company B, was among the first to get his men in position when the order was given. He and his entire company fought well . The conduct of many of the non-commissioned officers and men attracted my attention.

I will mention here that Lieutenant-Colonel Hobson, and Adjutant [J. R.] Latta rendered me valuable service during the action, and did much to get the men promptly in position, and remained at their post faithfully during the action.

I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,
