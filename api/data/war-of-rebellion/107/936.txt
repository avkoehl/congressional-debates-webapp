HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,November 6, 1862-1 a. m.

Brigadier-General STONEMAN,

Salem:

The commanding general directs me to inform you that General Bayard has been directed to move to Warrenton to endeavor to turn it and to gain if possible the line of the Rappahannock. You will therefore be obliged to picket your front with your own cavalry. Endeavor to maintain your communication with General Sigel's cavalry on your left and with that of the Ninth Army Corps on your right.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. D. RUGGLES,

Colonel and Assistant Chief of Staff.

Brigadier General A. PLEASONTON,

Commanding Cavalry Division:

General McClellan says do your best to hold Jackson in check if he is there, or at Loura [Luray] if he goes there, but do not lose sight of the importance of cutting the Loura [Luray] road, which is a matter of great necessity. Reynolds will probablyt be in Warrenton to-night or early to-morrow morning. Please send a party to communicate with Reynolds at that point to-morrow morning, but tell them to be careful and not get cought, as we may not gain possession before to-morrow.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Brigadier General A. PLEASONTON,

Commanding Cavalry Division:

The general commanding desires me to inform you that he has reliable information that Lee is at Gordonsville. G. W. Smith is in command at Warrenton, and it is reported that there is nothing but cavalry there. A captain is in command at Culpeper, so it is reasonable to suppose that the force there is small. Burnside and Reynolds are moving on Warrenton, but will probably not reach there before to-morrow. Burnside's right will rest on Waterloo. Sigel sends two divisions to-day to New Baltimore. Franklin at White Plains and Couch near you.
