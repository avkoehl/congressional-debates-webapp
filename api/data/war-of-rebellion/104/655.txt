MORROW'S STATION, May 7, 1865-7 p. m.

Brevet Major-General UPTON:

GENERAL: The command is here, just going into camp. I have received at this point copy of dispatches from General Wilson, Macon, and yourself, Augusta, both dated 6th instant. General Wilson thinks I had better send one regiment to or toward Newnan, while your advises indicate that it is or was at Powellton. If so, of course no force should be sent to Newnan. I have had repeated orders till now to push to Atlanta. Have obeyed them. I left one company at Griffin and one at Jonesborough. Both have good officers and strict instructions to keep a good watch and report. A company went also from Griffin to McDonough, with orders to keep to the right and go to Atlanta, informing me meantime of anything which may be of interest. I wish for specific orders, for I do not see the way very clearly. Will you send to-night? The country is very poor and no supplies to be found. At Griffin there are 5,000 bushels of corn, one-third damaged; 1,400 sacks included in this report. The assistant quartermaster says it belongs to the State of Georgia. There are also 7,000 suits of clothes and some medical supplies, &amp;c., most of which are said to belong to same party.

Yours, most respectfully,

E. F. WINSLOW,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
