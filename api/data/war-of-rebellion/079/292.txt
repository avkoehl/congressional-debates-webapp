ROME, October 15, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I sent two brigades, one section of artillery, and one regiment of cavalry toward Summerville as directed. Struck the enemy three miles above there, where they showed artillery and strong line. Captured General Allen's inspector-general, who says there are three brigades of cavalry at the bridge and Wheeler's command near Dirt Town. Citizens report Hood is now coming back and that there is infantry near Summerville. Will advise you further.

JNO M. CORSE,

Brigadier-General.

ROME, GA., October 15, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

All back safe. Drove Allen's DIVISION to Dirt Town and developed five brigades of cavalry guarding a train that is passing north through Dirt Town gap. No infantry could be seen or heard of. The impression among the prisoners is that the army is going to Tennessee. Our cavalry went twelve miles, leaving the infantry at Kinney's Creek, eight miles from here. Heard cannonading in direction of Snake Creek Gap. Wheeler was at Dirt Town this morning.
