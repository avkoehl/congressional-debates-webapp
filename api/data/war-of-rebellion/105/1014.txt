HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,San Francisco, Cal., April 19, 1862.

Brigadier General LORENZO THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: Colonel Carleton is on his march. I presume by this time that most of his troops have reached Fort Yuma, and his advance beyond that place. Colonel Carleton's command has been supplied with everything deemed necessary for a successful campaign. He has a wagon train (200 wagons), his own regiment (First Infantry), First Cavalry (five companeis), and Shinn's battery. The Fifth Infantry California Volunteers is being concentrated at Fort Yuma as a reserve and support for Carleton's command. Major Drum is still absent - probably now at Yuma inspecting the troops in that quarter. Troops in good health. I have nothing special to report. Everything is quiet.

Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
