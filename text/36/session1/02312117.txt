1860.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
111?
Mr. STANTON. Well, I cannot stand that.
The amendment to the amendment was with-
drawn.
Mr. BARKSDALE. I move that the commit-
tee do now rise.
The motion was not agreed to.
Mr. COLFAX. I wish to say to the gentleman
from Kentucky, that I am perfectly willing to have
a separate vote upon this or upon any otherprop
osition in the House.
Mr. BURNETT. I move to amend the amend-
ment of the gentleman by adding, " upon trips
where the mail service was rendered." I have
no disposition to weary the patience of the com-
mittee, but I want gentlemen to understand fully
the propositions upon which they are called to
vote. The gentleman, in reply to my remarks,
entered into an explanation; but he finally an-
swered the question in response to the gentleman
from Ohio, but he could not let the matter pass
without making a fling at the Postmaster Gen-
eral by remarking that he ought to have discon-
tinued the service everywhere. When his De-
partment was crippled by the action of that side
of the House, when he had no appropriation made
for that Department, when we had left him with-
out money, when he was anxious to give the
country all the necessary mail facilities, he de-
termined to provide the countfy with such mail
facilities as he could, and he did it; and yet the
gentleman, instead of giving him credit for it,
must make a fling at him.
Mr. COLFAX. No, sir; no fling.
Mr. BURNETT. Ill the exercise of his discre-
tion, he determined to economize by reducing the
service where it could be done, regard beinghad to
the best interests of the country. He reduced the
service in every section of the country. What
were the reasons which induced him to pursue
that course ?
The Department was crippled, and had no re-
sources, and he was determined to cut olF those
routes which the public interest could dispense
with; and I have not heard of a single instance
where he has done it, in which the postage came
to anything like what was paid for carrying the
mail; and I venture the assertion, that the postage
derived on the routes of which the gentleman from
Missouri complains, do not equal the cost of the
reduced service; and yet gentlemen complain be-
cause the Postmaster General, in his discretion,
undertook to economize in the service, and cut
down service where it was not needed.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I am op-
posed to the amendment. It leaves the matter sub-
stantially as it is in the bill. I am for providing
by law for the payment of those contractors who
have made their trips, where the Postmaster Gen-
eral has refused to give them the mail. There are
many such cases in my district, where the ser-
vice has been curtailed by the Postmaster Gen-
eral;yet the contractors, relying on the faith of
the Government, have made their trips, although
the Postmaster General refused to give them the
mails.
I therefore oppose the amendment to the amend-
ment; and I hope the committee will vote in the
amendment of the Committee on the Post Office
and Post Roads. I appeal to the friends of the
mail service to stand by the friends of the prop-
osition, to stand by the friends of the Committee
on the Post Office and Post Roads, and to vote in
their amendments.
Mr. HOUSTON. I appeal to the friends of the
mail service to rise.
The question was taken on Mr. Burnett's
amendment to the amendment; and it was rejected.
Mr. MAYNARD. This is an important bill.
It appropriates a good deal of money. It is very
evident that we cannot mature the bill this even-
ing. We may force the bill through; but I sub-
mit whether it is wise or proper to legislate in such
a way. We have been m session now six hours
and a half. I therefore move that the committee
do now rise.
Tellers were called for, and ordered; and
Messrs. Matnard and Buffinton were ap-
pointed.
The House divided; and the tellers reportedâ€”
ayes GO, noes 40.
So the motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose; and Mr. Branch hav-
ing taken the chair as Speaker pro tempore, Mr.
Dawes reported that the Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union had had under considera-
tion the Union generally, and particularly House
bill No. 503, to supply deficiencies in the service of
the Post Office Department for the fiscal year end-
ing 30th June, 1860, and had come to no conclu-
sion thereon:
And thereupon, on motion of Mr. ASHMORE,
(at half past five o'clock, p. m.,) the House
adjourned.

ADMISSION OF KANSAS.
Mr. GREEN. From the Committee on Terri-

mittee had referred to them a letter from the Pres-
ident of the Kansas constitutional convention,
communicating an enrolled copy of the constitu-
tion of Kansas, adopted at Wyandotte, July 29,
1850. At the same time, there was also referred
to the committee House bill No. 23, for the ad-
mission of Kansas into the Union. The committee
have instructed me to report the same without
recommendation, for such action as the Senate
may deem proper. At the same time, it is my
duty to notify the Senate that I shall move several
amendments, designed for the better protection of
the rights of the people of the United States, and
for the maintenance of good faith with the Indians
located under special treaties. I send up the docu-
ments, and move for the printing of the proposed
amendments.
The motion to print was agreed to.
Mr. GREEN. It is my duty also, in accord-
ance with a promise made, to move to make this
bill the spccial order for next Thursday, which I
think ought to bo done, to give the Senate proper
time to consider the subject.
Mr. COLLAMER. I suppose the chairman
of the committee means to fix Thursday of next
week.
Mr. GREEN. If you say so.
Mr. COLLAMER. Say Wednesday.
Mr. GREEN. I have no objection to that.
Mr. COLLAMER. Let it be postponed to
Wednesday of next week, at one o'clock, and
made the special order for that time.
The motion was agreed to.

ninety-seventh section of said act.
HOUR OP MEETING.
Mr. GREEN. I move that the standing order
of the Senate be changed, so that the regular hour
of meeting shall be eleven o 'clock instead of twelve.
I think we can do more business if we make the

lies over; but I shall press it at asutoequent time.
