1 he "subject" here pies* nted is ways and means For what
object^ To leleem the loan Ibis is so plain it admits of no
lllustrat on—so t ue that none can deny it— m btuuiv just that
the "amendmer f," and the piosposition ( undei considtratien,"
can íesfond to one and the same question So that it you pet
sonify each, and ask them the question " Wkut come ye up
for?" both must give one and the s me answer, which is this
"We were ordei cd hereto supply the icat/s andneans" if
you ask again "What is your object?'3 Ihe an&wer is, "To
stand as a pledge foi this loan "
The "sub)prt" and the ohjpct of the amendment being the
same with^lhose of tne proposition "undei (onsideia jon," the
two propositions aio not different within the meaning of the
rule, therefore the amendment is in oidei, and the Chan ought
to be sustained
It is true, that m one case, the subject rnaHer is introduced or
called into being by the formility of sales—whilst in the o*her it
is brrught from customs The foim vaite^ but the sul ]ect is

The only object of this fifth section was, hereaftet-j whert
others should demand in a separate bill that the public land*
shall be pledged, that ihey shall have it in their power to turn
to thisfifiheection, andsay theie is no necessity to pledgeih%
public lands, because we have already pledged the revenue!
horn customs That was the only object on the face of ths
earth that he could see in this fií h section, unless it did pro-
vide the ways aad means to redeem the stock If so, why did
the gentleman ask, Will you require the Secretary of the Trea-
sury to prevent these bonds fiom depreciating, whiistyou have
not provided the ways and means'* Such "peculiar" enemies
to an Administration he had never seen These were tests of a
gentleman's professions He knew that to commit this Admi-
nistration to b s bands was giving the lamb to die wolf
Mr TILLVORE had hoped m mercy, after alt that was said
by the other "peculiai" fuendsoi the Administration the other
dav, that these ' peculiar Inends" would think the Committee
oi Ways and Means had been sufficiently torn on this mat'er.
But it see mad not, and they were now chaiged with being the
' peculiar" enemies oí this Administration And on what wae
(hat opinion bastd? Where waa the act to which the gentleman
referí ed as evidence ei hei that the committee or the chairmaft
o( the Committee of Ways and Means was a "peculiar*' enemy
of tl is Administration? What act was it iliat the gentleman
had refeireduit Waa it that the Ccmmittee of Ways and
Means had seen fit to lay before this House and before the
country the statement from the Secretary of the Treasury that
showed that the Tteasury was bankrupt, and that asked from
the hands of the Representatives of the people alaw that should
authorize him to supply its wan si This, then, was the "pecu-
liar" crime of (he 'jecu'iar" enemies of this Administration.
And he believed this was the only crime at at] events, that had
b°en stated But he was wi'hng—and m this he would speak:
foi a majority oí the Committee of Ways and Means—that their
conduct should be compared with the conduct of the honorable
gen leman from Virginia
What had been the course of the Committee of Ways and
Means in referet ce to this Admmistiauon thatshould call down
on them denunciations from that gentleman? Where had they
been found wanting in not only attempting to sustain this Admi-
nistration so far asitwab light, but to sustain the honor and cre-
dit of oui common country?
When the first communication was made to the Committee
of Wavs and Means nom the Secretary of the Treasury stating
that the Tieasutywas empty, what did that committee doi
Did they they delay action on the subject—did they put it off",
eithei in committee or in the House? Wo On the contrary,
with the utmost despatch, at their veiy first meeting after this
communication, they repotted a bill for supplying the wants of
the Tiea ury They weie then infoimed that a loan would not
~'pply thepicentexigenciesof heTieasuiy, thattheloan could
not be negotiated in this country and that it was then necessary,
to supply the pressing wants of the iiea^ury, to issue Tiea ury
note4:, to which it was well known a majority of the committee
weie opposed Di 1 the committee n-iusc to comj ly with this
urgent demar ¡of the Tieasury of this Administration, of w'nch
they were chaigedwith being the £ pecuhv" enemies! Within
tweuty four hours they lepoi teda bil authorizing the itsue of
Tieasury notes that wasdeminde 1 by this Administration And
«hat was the fir&t movement of the "peculiar" friends of this
Admmis a'ton m aid of that pioject? lit, need not say to
th se now heie that when this bill came up for consideration
the very fust move was to tack ton a proposition to repeal the
land bill, and thereby to drag m o discussion a question which
could not an! ought not to be settled without long diacus-
s o wnilstthe Treasury and this Administration weie sinking
in L nkraptcy and infamy
That was the difference in the couisc die gtntleman from
Virginia had pursued in sustaining this Administration and
the cienit and honoi of the com uy, and tí ecouise of the Com-
m ttee of Waysand 3VXe,?ns
