COLONEL: I have reports from Major C. McDermit, commanding Fort Churchill, May 1, 1865. There is trouble between the white people and Indians near the Sink of the Carson, forty miles ortheast of Fort Churchill. The major has gone there with twenty men to settle the difficulty, and as soon as he returns he will go to the Truckee and Pyramid Lake to settle difficulties of the same kind, and after that he will go to Walker River Reservation, where it appears that the friends of the two Indians who murdered Stewart and Rabe have murdered one of friendly Indians who assisted Captain Wallace in arresting the muderers.
