DISTRICT OF FLORIDA,

Camp Milton, March 18, 1864.

COLONEL: In compliance with your order of this date I have the honor to submit the following report:

In the retreat from Camp Finegan on February 8, I lost at the Twelve-Mile Station, 4 miles above the camp, two 3-inch iron rifled guns, and at Baldwin one 3-inch iron rifled gun. I can also state that Captain Dunham lost at the Twelve-Mile Station two 6-pounder bronze guns. I will further state that the condition of my horses was bad, and that when ordered to move my battery in retreat I was compelled to leave one of my caissons, forge, and battery wagon, in consequence of their condition, resulting from the effects of a disease prevailing among the battery horses at the time and the want of long forage.

I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. F. ABELL,

Captain, Commanding Co. B, Milton Light Arty.

Colonel R. B. THOMAS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
