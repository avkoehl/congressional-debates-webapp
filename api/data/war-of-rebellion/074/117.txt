enemy surrounding it, to prevent it being withdrawn from the position where it was captured, and immediately afterward, by direction of Major-General Logan (General Smith being at the time on another part of the line), organized a body of his troops from his reserves not in position, and led them forward to the recapture of the battery and that part of our line situated near his own, then in possession of the enemy. The movement of the troops, under General Woods in this action was pronounced splendid by General Logan, who witnessed it. It was made suddenly and with the greatest vigor, and struck, the enemy's left immediately in flank. General Woods directed it in person. The battery and line were retaken and the enemy compelled to retire precipitately. Captain De Gress was present to retake possession, of the guns and turn them on the discomfited enemy which he did with the most terrible effect, as they were moving off the field in confusion. It was no surprising, since the line had been so much weakened by the withdrawal of Colonel Martin's brigade to re-enforce General Dodge, commanding Sixteenth Army Corps, that he should gain advantage over this part of the line. The action resulted so quickly that re-enforcements were not able to reach the point until after the two guns of Company A, First Illinois Light Artillery, had been removed from the line and taken to the rear by the enemy. Lieutenants Smyth and Raub, of the battery acted with the utmost gallantry, using their pieces until the enemy had quite gained their situation, when Lieutenant Raub was killed instantly and Lieutenant Smyth taken prisoners. It was afterward ascertained from prisoners that Lieutenant Smyth was killed before reaching the rear of the enemy's lines.* General Smith, who was present at the time on the center of the line where Battery A was posted soon caused the troops to rally at that point and almost immediately retook the position abandoned by us a few minutes before with only the loss of the two guns mentioned.

The Fourth Division, General Harrow commanding, since about 1 o'clock had been hotly engaged with the enemy, who was pressing him at almost all points. As soon as the enemy was discovered in the rear of the Seventeenth Corps, he caused some of his artillery to be reversed and opened with a great deal of effect upon them, in some measure deterring their movement, and thus allowing the troops of the Seventeenth and Sixteenth Corps to be disposed to meet the approaching body of the enemy in the rear. General Harrow maintained all parts of his line, though at a severe loss. In the engagement with the Fourth Division the gallant and meritorious Colonel Lucien Greathouse, Forty-eighth Illinois Volunteers, nobly gave his life at the head of his gallant command, urging them to defend their position at every hazard. He was shot through the right breast, and almost immediately expired. Thus passed away a young, gallant, and fearless officer, a sacrifice upon the altar of perpetual Union. The dispositions of General Harrow during the engagement and the manner in which his troops were commanded, elicited the hearty commendation of Major-General Logan in my presence, as did likewise, the conduct of Generals Woods and Lightburn, commanding First and Second Divisions, respectively. The battle lasted with more or less fury until night-fall, when the corps rested in possession of all the positions held by the troops at any
