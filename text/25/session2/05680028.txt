poiatmg in his inaugural address " en or of opi-
nion may be toleiated while reason is left free to
combat it." What is the pietext for thef>e resolu-
tions? The same, the very same that produced the
gag laws If the iieedom ot speech is tolerated, if
the freedom of He press is not abridged, it the
right of petition is not silenced in the non-slave-
holdmg Stales, if the people in these St ites speak,
write, pint, assemb'e or petition on any sublet
conneckj nth sla\trj, thfy lie "inteimeddlmg"

within the denunciations ot thest c-e utuns, 01
the assumption that the Union is end iiqoed, In
arraying one people against ano lici Sn, would
not the same pretext not only abndce but acunlly
silence the press of this nation'? Look at yom
leading party presses eveiy wheie do they not pub-
lish daily mflimmatoi), and, not unlrequently
false matter, calculated to array tne people again11
each other, and, in the language of these ¡evolu-
tions, to weaken the Union1 And yet who is pre-
pared to establish a censorship over the press? He
would not say who, but he would say, that, in his
opinion, the resolution1-under consideration assert
the principle in terms not to be misundeistood
He (Mr S) was asked why he had offered the
amendment' He would, with gieat pie isuif, res
pond to (he inquiry He had man} íeasons for m-
tioducingit lie would gnea lew of them, lirst,
because he wished the antidou to go with the
poison, if euhei was to be sent forth as the doo-
tnnes of the fiepublic Secondlj, because the
pimciples contained in the amendment were
such as he loved to ie<ui to and cherish Be-
cause he had some anxiety to asoeitaiu whelhei
the ancient landmarks weic still left standing imídst
the revolution of parties, or whether they had been
eiased by the political tornado that has swept over
the land, wiethei he had read the Deelaiation of
Independence, the Constitution of the United
States, and the history of his country in vain,
whether those doctrines and fundamental princi-
ples have become too old fashioned for (he times,
and whether he had to study a ntw political cieed
before he could discharge his dutv to his Stale and
the nation heie These «ere some of the lei ons,
he hoped they would be oonsileied a suiliciftil an-
swer to the niqiui) Senators fave i ible to the re-
solutions ha\c betn pleased to cxpiess then ic^iet
that the amendment his been (¡Tend To those
gentlemen he had onH tosí/ that he i -,ult d tie
mtioducticn of the rtsolu ons is honestly as they
legielted the mtioduclion of the amendment, he
would, therefore, with the censent of the Senators,
set off his regret against theirs lie had hoard
with surprise the Senator from Michigan (Mr
(Noivell) the moment his amendment had been of-
fered, inquire of the Chair whethrr a motion to
postpone it indefinitely would be m older The
zeal of that Senator is rather unaccountable lie
had, to be sure, been walking in the footsteps of
the mover of the resoluinns on this subject, but
he (Mi S ) supposed that the courtesy lint had
been exlen led to him on the i"trodu< tion ot li
miniatme lesolulit ns would have ad eJ htm ol
what was due tootheis, even if he wis opposed to
then measures
Mr S said that he had no olhei feelings than
those of personal kindness foi that Senator, but
that it struck him as unkind and uncourteous in the
Senator to take the course he did líe (Mr S )
did not object to any want of order in the inquirj,
but ot that courtesy which is due on such occa-
sions He had voted for the printing of the resolu-
tions of that Senator, and yet a motion to indefi-
nitely postpone them would also have been in order
The Senator does not know whether his resolutions
come up to the enlarged views of him, (Mr S )
To this he would only say, that he really could not
say whether they did or did not, as he had never
read them He had heard them at the Clerk's ta-
ble until he had become satisfied that they «ere
a mere miniature reflection of the great light
emanating from the resolutions of the Senatoi from
South Carolina The Senator from Ohio (Mr
Allen) expresses himself opposed to the amend-
ment, and says he greatly prefers the amendment
that he offered This is very natural, it is to be
expected.   Nature herself prompts all animals to
nourish, protect, and love their own offspring in
pieference to the progeny of others, and he cer-
tainly had no disposition to find fault with this
manifestation ef that Senator's regard for the laws
of Nature, but really the objections of that Senator
were rather unexpected He sav s the amendment
to which the amendment of that Senator is offered,
is, as a lawyer would say, de hors the record, or, in
othci words, not connected with the subject-matter
of the íesolutions Why, sir, does not the Senator
himself know that his amendnent was drawn after
the amendment offered b} him'(Mr S) Ifoneisout
of the record, is not the ol'iet' The Senator has not
even the meutof oiigmality in his a neiidmcnt. The
Senator says we might as w ell resoh e that the Koran
is not the evidence of the Christian's faith as to adopt
the amendment offered by him, (Mr S ) To this, he
would merely say, that if the doctrines of the De-
claration of Independence, the doctrines of the
Constitution of the United States, of the Jefferso-
nian party of that d ly, of those great political,
fundamental, and constitutional tinths contained
m the amendment, bear the same relation to the
doctimes held by that Senator, that the Koran
does to the Christian íehgion, then the Senator was
correct m the conclusion to which he had come,
but not otherwise lie would leave the Senator to
dec ide the matter foi himself
The Senitor from New Hampshire (Mi Hub-
b ird) has been pleased to say that the amendment
had not the ment of novelty in it, and that it was
intended to embarrass the passage of these resolu-
tions The latter charge, in its offensive sense, he
had so fully answered before, that he would merely
say to that Senator now, that he could scarcely
claim for the charge (he mei it of originality, as it
had been made by the Senatoi from South Caroh
na, (Mi Calhoun,) and, after having been met by
him, (Mr S ) and refuted, it was honorably aban-
doned by that Senator If, however, the Senator
from New Hampshire wishes to be understood in
a sense not offensiv e, b( (Mr S ) would say, that
ííiíí'iwill always embairass its opposers, and in
that sense the amenddment u as introduced to
embari iss the passage of the resolutions The
Senator says that the amendrnmthas not the merit
of novelty, and he has read from a paper from
the gianite Stile to show tint during the progress
ot the usolutions of that State similar amend-
ments veie offered W< 11, su, admit the fact, and
whild es a prove1 Why, sir, merely that those
gieat fun limintal principles tre cherished yet,
even m JVw Hampshire, by aponion of the people
But, sir, does the Senator chim for himself any
eiedit for diseovciin, that which he (Mr S ) had
avowed from the outsel, that his amendment did
not contain noveltus, that the doctrines were prima-
ry, fundamental, constitutional and vital political
truths' Sm, has noielty any special merit m the
eyes of that Senator' If so, the Senator from
South Cirohnu has prepaied a feast for him, and
he is welcome to enjoy it
But sir, theie is another avowed principle in
these resolutions 'hat most not be passed in silence
It issnmcs that it may become necessary for this
nation to attach territory (Terns) to the Union, for
th" purpose of protecting and extending the domestic
institutions (slamiy) of the South This is a solemn
question, and one which he hoped would be
promotly met and as promptly decided He would
not now anticípate the arguments upon it, but he
begged to be excased for sd}ing lhat it was a most
odious principle to hum, and suflicient, in his mind,
to alarm the friends of freedom every where He
would take this occasion, however, to say, that he
had no connection whatever w ith the Abolitionists,
nor did he even know any of them , he believed
them, so far as he could leain, to be a highly re
spectable portion of our fellow-citizens, yet enter-
taining, as he honestly believed, mistaken views
of this great question. They certainly could not
be apprized of the fact, that the very course they
had marked out for themselves, and which they
were pursuing, if reports speak truth, on that sub-
ject, was the worst possible course to attain the
object they have in view, if it he merely, as he
supposed it was, to induce the master to liberate
his slave Sir, does not this people see that the
consequences which have already grown out of
their course have been so far from producing the
happy results which they had promised themselves
to witness from their exertions, that excitement,
mobs, and death have followed in their train 1 Do
they not see that the master, instead of loosing his
hold on the slave, has taken a firmer grasp * Do
they not see that this question may root the Re-
public to the centre' Do they not know thai
should they be instrumental in exciting the slave
to deeds of desperation, they would be morally
accountable for the act 1 Do they not know that
the Constitution itself was founded upon a com-
promise , that the slaveholdmg States wejre a party
to that compiomise, and that neither this Govern-
ment, nor any of the non-skveholdmg States, has
any thing to do with the institution of slavery m
these States, but that it is a matter exclusively for
their own íegulation, and any interference with it
by non-slaveholdmg States can produce no good,
and may do great harm, and is, therefore, unwise
and impolitic, to say the least of it' He could only
give his opinion, he could not control this matter
He would say to the citizens of the non slavehold-
mg States, /mnds off; leave this matter as the Con-
stitution left it, preserve the harmony of this peo-
ple, and stand by the Union as it is If our insti-
tutions are moie to our liking than are those of
these States, let us rest contented with our situa-
tion, and not, by any act of ours, aggravate the dif-
ficulties of our brethren of the South, where we
can do no good, and may do much harm. Sir,
(said Mr S ) wink he openly avowed the convic-
tions of his mind on this important subject, he felt
it due to the occasion and the South to say, that
while he would extend to them the full force of
their constitutional guaranties, m the protection of
their domestic institutions as they noU> are, he wished
the Senators specially representing that interest to
understand, distinctly, that he would cavil on the
ninth pai t of a hair, on any question going to ex-
tend the principles or boundary of slavery one inch,
and he would submit it to the calm and solemn
consideration of those Senators, whether the South
was not greatly instrumental in exciting and aggra-
vating this matter Why not rest contented with
their constitutional security1* Why come into this
body asking to extend the territory and principles
of slavery, when they well know that of all the
subjects under the heavens there is none so well
calculated to excite and arouse the feelings of the
non-slaveholdmg States' Whether it be fanaticism
or not, the facts arc the same Why resort to un-
usual, summary, and unconstitutional trials, con-
victions, and executions of those who maybe even
guilty ot opposing the institution of slavery? Do
they not see that wnde the course of the Abolition-
ists inflames the South, then course is calculated to
inflame the North, and to even make Abolitionists of
those who would not otherwise take any part in
the matter' Do they not see that this fire can ne-
ver be extinguished while fuel is continually
added to it' Would it not be well—nay, more,
as they regard the Union, as they regard the peace
and harmony of this people, aie the parties, as
much as lies within their povv er, not required—to
withdraw the fuel and extinguish the flame' He
vv as well apprized that neither the Abolitionists nor
slaveholders may thank him for his advice in this
matter He knew his inability ti reach the feelings
or instruct the judgment of either He stood here not
the advocate of a particular sect or section of this
great Kepubhc, on this question, but as the advo-
cate of the perpetuity of the Union, of the freedom
of speech and of the press, of the equality of man,
of the right of petition, of those constitutional, fun-
damental, and political truths, contained in his
amendment, which were erected as the landmarks
of this gieat Republic, by our ancestors,and conse-
crated with their blood, and he felt satisfied to point
his countiymen to them as altogether worthy of
their confidence and regard
Mr HUBBARD explained, and was understood
to say, that he did not intend to charge the doc-
trines of Jefferson and Andrew Jackson (as con 
tamed m Mr Smith's amendment) with wanting
the merit of novelty.
Mr. BENTON thought the whole subject had
better be referred to a select committee, with in-
structions to report at some future day; jMemisiBg,
