re-enforcements have been placed in Fort Pickens, in obedience to orders from the United States Government. Lieutenant Worden must have given these orders in violation of his word. Captain Adams executed them in violation of our agreement.

PENSACOLA, April 14, 1861.

Honorable L. P. WALKER,

Secretary of War:

Lieutenant Worden assured me he only had a verbal message of pacific nature. The re-enforcement of Pickens was preceded by signal guns from there. What caused it I cannot ascertain. Worden's message may have had no connection with the move. He was in Pensacola when the move was made. Five thousand men here now, and two thousand more coming. Subsistence, forage, and transportation should be hurried. You can now spare the supplies from Sumter, which is ours.

HEADQUARTERS TROOPS CONFEDERATE STATES,Near Pensacola, Fla., April 14, 1861.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL C. S. ARMY,

Montgomery:

SIR: It is a matter of impossibility for me to keep you advised of the arrival of troops. They come under such various orders, and fail so often to report at all, that they are [here] for days sometimes before I hear of them. As near as I can ascertain this morning, by a visit of a staff officer to each camp, the inclosed statement of my present strength is very nearly accurate.* I am obliged to receive them by order, and let the muster rolls be made a afterwards.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BRAXTON BRAGG,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN L. WORDEN,

Lieutenant, U. S. Navy.
