any of the great interests of the countrj On the
contrary, he thought it beneficial to all, and he
really hoped it would be permitted to pass He
would, however, cheerfully acquiesce in the will of
the majority
Mr CLAY testified to the liberality of the Sena-
tor from New York, (Mr Wright ) He absolved
him fiom all party feelings in relation to tVe pre-
mature passage of the bill, but he submitted to the
better judgment of the gentleman, whether it would
not be better to give time to act understanding^ on
the matter. He could not agree vi ith his friend
from Pennsylvania, (Mr Buchanan) that ihe bill
did not conflict with the principles ¡aid down m t'ae
compromise act The abolishing of credit, on
the one hand, and the extension on the othei, were
clear violations of the spirit of that act. Again,
he was not prepared to say what the warehousing
system might be, it \yas a new and untried experi-
ment, and should therefore be approached \uth
caution The Senator from Pennsylvania thinks
it will have a tendency to stpady the market, he
(Mr C ) was by no means certain that such would
be the case Instead of goods remaining 11 Eu-
rope, they would be thrown in immense masses
into the warehouses here, where the dealers could
raise or depress the price at pleasure At all events
he would like to have the views of sound practical
men, of the mercantile and manufacturing inte-
rests, before he entered on an untried experiment
The relative charge oí storing between Liverpool
and the ports of this country, would have so im-
portant a bearing on this matter, that Senators
must see the necessity of having all the light that
could be afforded, and he therefore hoped sincerely
that the bill w ould be postponed until the first Mon-
day in December next
Mr BUCHANAN made a short reply, stating
his. inability to vote for the postponement, and re-
iterating his convictions that the bill w ou'd prevent
fluctuations of the pnces of foreign commodmes—
the great cause of injury to home manufactures
Mr BAYARD thought the bill had a tendency
to disturb the compromise act It gave the impor-
ter a credit of three years at his option, which must
be considered as beneficial to the importing inte-
rest, it enabled the foreign manufacturer to fill the
warehouses with goods and deluge the markets at
pleasure No interest could thnve where theie
wa¡> such an eternal shifting It was the ever vary-
ing policy of this administration and Go\ eminent
that created the present embarrassment The com
promise act had been passed with the solemn un-
derstanding, that the feaures contained in it were
to remain inviolate for a given number of years,
he theiefore thought it sound policy not to touch
any subjects that could by any possibility be con-
strued into an infraction of its pimciples He
would therefore vote for the postponement
Mr. NILES said there was some weight to be
attached to the remarks he had heard from the op-
posite side in relation to the abolishment of the
credit system He was glad to hear it admitted
that we looked to all the great interests of ihe
country. He thought it had been said that we
looked only to the interests of the Treasury He
■vvas pleased to say that the measures of that body
had already made a salutary change, and this was
one of the measures to be acted on to settle public
opinion He was anxious that this bill should be
added to those already passed, because m his opi-
nion it would do much to give people that confi-
dence m Congress which he was sorry to sav had
been wanting for some time It had been said there
were no feelings m this body lor the people, and
that idea had been spread far and wide, with a
view to strengthen the assertion He felt con-
vinced, however, that the people were well satisfied
with the measures that had emanated fiom that
body , and there required but this one to pass to
make them the crown and glory of this Congress
He thought it would do much 10 raise the value of
glory, which his friend from Georgia (Mr King)
had said, on a late occasion, was so much depre-
ciated. 4Te had no idea that the Executive should
engross all the glory, but insisted that the Senate
came in, for its share
It had been said that confidence alone was want-
ing to heal every thing; but it was bis impression
that stability ia, quite as much wantirg as confi-
dence When the people saw a uniform system of
legislation, they would conform to that legislation,
and deduce good from the evils they had been made
to suffer through the banking system Such was
their native activity and energy, they would rise
«upcrior to every crisis The bill before them was
fraught with good to the mercantile and manufac-
turing interests, and he therefore hoped it would
not be postponed
Mr CLAY would suggest to the gentleman from
Connecticut (Mr Niles) whether it v, ou'd not be
better to economise his glorj, and reserve a little
for the next session, and he put it to Mi N
whether he ought not to join m postponing this
matter, lest he should have no subject for g'ory in
the coming day
The question was then taken on the postpone-
ment oí the bill to the first Monday m December
Mr CLAY having asked for the yeas and na>s,
theie appeared for postponing 15, against it 23, as
follows

The bill having been reported to the Senate as
amended, m Committee of the Whole, tne ques-
tion was taken on ordering it to b-s engrossed for a
third reading by yeas and nats, when theie ap-
peared for it 28, against it 5, as follows

Mr WRIGHT moved to take up the bill extend-
ing the time on merchants' bonds, which had been
returned from the House of Representatives with
an amendment Mr W explained that the Com-
mittee on Finance had eximined the amendment,
and were of opinion that it ought to be con-
curred in
Mr KING of Alabama moved to lay it on the
table, that he might examire it, pledging himself
to call it up to-morrow The motion was adopted,
and the bill laid on the table
Mr WRIGHT said he felt it his duty now to
move to take up the bill i evoking the charters of
certain banks in the District of Columbia, and for
the suppression of small notes therein
Mr NORVELL uiged the postponement ot the
bill to the regular session He adverted to its
character, and said that if the stern and rigid
features of this bill could be applied to the banks
of New York, (by which the example of suspend-
ing specie payments had been set,) he should
be entirely willing so to apply them, and he would
follow up the application to all the banks that had
followed that peínicious examp e But it must be
perfectly manifest to every Senator who had re-
flected upon the subject, that while the neighboring
State banks refused io redeem their bills with
specie, the banks of this District could not keep
their vaults open tuenty-four hours It would,
therefore, be useless, it would be vain, it would not
produce the desired effect, to urge the passage of
this bill at the present time It not only required
an impossibilily of the banks, but, in their efforts
to comply with the wishes of Congiess, they would
have to press their debtors The people of the
District weie without a representation m this or the
other body The bill would oppress them, and, as
they had no special representative to support their
interests here, they deserved the particular conside
ntisn of eveiy Senator It could be productive of
no evil consequences to postpone the bill to the
regular session, and, in conclusion, he would make
a motion to that effect.
Mr WRIGHT said the bill before the S nste
had two objects in view one to coerce at as early
a day as practicable, a resumption of specie pay-
ments by the banks, the other to suppress the
worthless paper rags which had become almost the
exclusive circulation of the District Over the
banks of this district, Congress had exclusive con-
trol, and the question involved no constitutional
objection If, however, gentlemen thought it loo
severe on the banks, and that some consideration
w as due under existing circumstances, he was not
disposed to resist such modificat ons as might be
offered If sixty days was too short a period, that
might be extended to a longer term, he was not dis-
posed to act harshly with these institutions, but he
considered it the duty of Congress to coerce as
speedy a resumption as possible, but above all was it
incumbent on them to discountenance and suppress
the issues of individuals
Mr KENT thought the banks of this District
is as good and sound a condition as those of any
other in the country, the Bank of the Metiopohs
had done what few others had, that had beenhonor-
ed with the deposites Almost its first step after
the suspension, was to cancel its debt to Govern-
ment
Mr BENTON did not think it was generally
understood in the Senate, that these banks had ai-
read) had three continued renewals within the last
eighteen jears In the first one given, it was ex-
pressly stipulated lhat if, at any time, they should
fail lo redeem their notes m specie, it should be the
duty of Congress to revoke their charters It was
also stipulated, that they should not issue or reis-
sue any notes of a less denomination than five
dollars, and yet we had seen that ihey had not only
suspended specie payments, but had been issuing
notes of as low a stamp as twenty-five cents As
their charters would expire m July next, it w as the
object of the committee to force a resumption be-
fore lhat period
He did not believe Congress was disposed to per-
petuate thoseáinstitutions, they were, in his opinion,
quite unnecessary, as Government di-bursed more
hard money than could be absorbed in the District.
But, if we did not require them to wind up, we
should, at least, force them to a resumption before
their charter expires We already saw another
bank issuing the no'es of a defunct institution, and
so far as he was concerned, he was unwilling to
leave the people to individual action, to obtain their
money afer their charters had expired It had been
said that the people of this District had no represen-
tation When he saw ihe honest and industrious
móchame toiling fiom morning until night cracking
stone, and paid in wretched irredeemable paper and
shin-plasters, while this body was paid m gold, he
felt indeed that the people had no representation
We had been told that one of these banks had paid
up its debt to t>e Federal Government, and how
was it paid' Why, in wretched depreciated paper,
which the Government had received, and pushed
on the needy and helpless laborer, who, with his
starving family, was obliged to take that or no-
thing, and who would be glad to get it, even though
it were fifty per cent below par By this mode of
paying, the bank had made fifteen per cent out of
the Government, and now thought it a hardship to
be made to redeem its notes of five dollars With all
the profits made out of the Government and people,
they did not put themselves in a condition to re-
deem their p'edges He would not only give his
voice (o make them pay up, but to keep out of
circulation that moral pestilence, a smn-plaster cur-
rency What, asked Mr B would be the exam-
ple to the States, if w e, where we had the control,
did not exercise it to bring about a healthful me-
dium of exchange1 Would it not be saying to
them, " do likewise, and continue to deluge the
whole country with shin-plasters'?" If a htt'e more
time was asked, he had no objection to grant it,
but he would lift his vo ce agamsi any postpone-
ment of the bill, and agamsi fixing a reasonable
p nod for ihe resumption, as he had no idea of
leaving the people to piomote the interests of the
Sawyers by suits against these institutions after
their charters had expired.
Mr KENT said the currency was no worse
here than in other portions of the Union, it was in
