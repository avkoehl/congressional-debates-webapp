manding general from his troops, to diminish his moral as well as official control, and to harass him with the constant fear that his most matured plans may be marred by orders from the Government which it is impossible for him to anticipate..

I respectfully request that your will forbear to exercise your power upon these points. You instructed to my "skill and judgment," as you kindly express it, a work full of hazards and difficulties; may I not ask that you will extend your confidence in me to those matters of minor detail which legitimately belong to my position..

I appreciate fully the demands upon your time and attention by the great pressure upon all our lines of defense which you so vividly present in your letter of the 25th ultimo . By leaving to me the exclusive control of the military arrangements appertaining to my command here you will be relieved of much that must divert your mind from that general supervision which is the part of your exalted station. .

From all I can learn, the disposition to re-enlist is not very general. I will do what I can to stimulate it into activity. Care must be taken, however, not to reduce our force so much as to make its very weakness the inducement to the enemy's attack.

I have written, sir, in no spirit of captiousness, but with perfect frankness, in order to remove any causes of misunderstanding and to secure concert of action between us. .

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,.

General S. COOPER, Adjutant and Inspector General:.

SIR: We are beginning to feel the want of the arms recently sent to Richmond under orders from the War Department. One regiment all early has 23 men returned from hospital who are without arms. The recruiting directed in General Orders, Numbers 2, will give is men who cannot be armed unless a part at least of the arms referred to can be returned..

Permit me again to remind the War Department that a division and five brigades (including those of two members of Congress, Senator select) are without their proper generals. The great number of colonels and other field officers who are absent sick makes the want of general officers the more felt..

Several of the colonels of this army are well qualified to be brigadier-generals. Besides Cols. A. P. Hill and Forney, whom I have mentioned before, Colonels Hampton, Winder, Garland, and Mott are fully competent to command brigades.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,.

SIR: The execution of War Department General Orders, Numbers 1, will greatly reduce the strength of the "one year" regiments of this army. They constitute about two-thirds of the whole number. I respectfully
