HDQRS. ARMIES OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES,Richmond, June 7, 1864.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Marietta, Ga.:

I inclose you herewith copy of a note this morning addressed to the President, which will explain itself. The object is to place before him the real condition of affairs with you. I send a copy also to General Lee.

The force in front of Lee in Virginia was composed of four corps, Sedgwick, Hancock, Warren, and Burnside commanding. Just now it is increased by about 12,000 men from Butler's force, under Baldy Smith. From this you will see the work on hand, and be able to judge better than I can what should be our policy. Grant has been so much crippled by his constant repulses (of which he sustained a very severe one yesterday) that I apprehend but little damage from him now.

Very respectfully and truly, yours,

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT:

Mr. PRESIDENT: The condition of affairs in Georgia is daily becoming more serious, and though the enemy there has for a few days been quiet, I fear it is only to avail himself of heavy re-enforcements. The force under Sherman is composed as follows, viz:

(1) Palmer's corps, (2) Howard's corps-Rosecrans' old army consolidated; (3) Hooker's corps-the two from Virginia consolidated; (4) Schofield's corps, from East Tennessee; (5) Logan's corps, F. P. Blair's, Dodge's division-McPherson's command. These have been joined by (6) A. J. Smith's corps (Seventeenth), from Red River, and Major General S. D. Lee reports another infantry corps (Sixteenth) from Red River now moving from Memphis, and that he had recalled the force ordered by him to Johnston's support to oppose its progress.

Should all these forces concentrate on the Army of Tennessee we may well apprehend disaster. As the entire available force of the Confederacy is now concentrated with our two main armies, I see no solution of this difficulty but in victory over one of the enemy's armies before the combination can be fully perfected, &amp;c.

BRAXTON BRAGG.
