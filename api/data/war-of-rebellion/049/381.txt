CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

October 25, 1863.

The attention of corps commanders is directed to the distribution and use of the prisoners on the march. They will be distributed to the troops and trains so as habitually to precede the heads of columns of trains, to repair the roads, prepare the crossing of streams, &amp;c. When the trains are separated a suitable distribution of the prineers will be made.

In the recent operations it is understood that few if any pioneers accompanied the supply and baggage trains, and various delays occurred for the want of slight repairs on the roads and crossings of streams.

Care will be taken to select faithful and energetic officer for pioneer duty.

By command of Major-General Meade:

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
