PULASKI, June 1, 1864.

Major POLK,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Nashville:

Have we any forces from Memphis, or in that direction, moving this way? Fighting is expected Saturday [or] Sunday at Leighton; that our forces drove the enemy to Town Creek and fought them Sunday. Some of the dead had been seen at Florence. How is this? Think Rowett's cavalry and Ninth Ohio, at Decatur, should be on the river. Artillery should be here, as before advised.

JOHN C. STARKWEATEHR,

Brigadier-General.

BURNT CHURCH, OR CROSS-ROADS, June 1, 1864.

General SHERMAN:

I saw General Thomas this morning and he informed me that General McCook was ordered to act vigorously against the enemy on the Acworth road and to co-operate with me. Arrived here I met General Elliott, who informed me that General McCook will not move until General Schofield has occupied the Acworth road. General Schofield says he may not get on the road to-day. I shall move at 12 m. and comply with your wishes if possible, irrespective of co-operation or assistance, neither of which do I expect. In case you do not hear from me by dark you may calculate that my communications with you are cut off. I shall send to your new headquarters selected this morning by Colonel [Captain] Aunderied.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

GEORGE STONEMAN,

Major-General, &c.
