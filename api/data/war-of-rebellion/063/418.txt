FRANK S. BOND,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, May 3, 1864.

Messrs. HILL, FINCH, AND PARKER,

Committee of Machinists and Blacksmiths:

GENTLEMEN: Having informed me of the promptitude and willingness with which the members of your association yield to the public necessity, forbidding further contest with the proprietors of shops having Government contracts, &amp;c., you desire to know if I think the public interests would be injured by your going elsewhere for work. I think an amicable and friendly understanding between yourselves and the capitalists, in which they would give you satisfactory assurance of their intention to deal with you and treat you in the spirit of justice and liberality, would be best for all parties and for the public interests.

I should therefore feel obliged, as a public servant, and out of regard for the just interests of this city and of all concerned, that you should take this course, and go to work as usual, and I should be very much disappointed if pursuing this course you are not met in a corresponding spirit by your former employer.
