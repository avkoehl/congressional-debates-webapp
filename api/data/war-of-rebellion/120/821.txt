Whether any of the goods shall be sent to other prisons than Tyler must depend upon the discretion of the officers charged with the distribution, as well as upon your facilities of transportation.

CHARLESTON, September 13, 1864.

General BRAGG.

Many Yankee prisoners now here profess to be highly indignant with their Government for not exchanging them, especially since the report that it will exchange those whose terms have expired, and they express an earnest desire to take the oath of allegiance, and many of them to join our army if we will permit them. Can anything be done in that way?

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
