25th CoNG....lst Sess.                                Making public officers depositories—Mr. Webster.                                                      Sfenate.
nected with the circulation, that the late administra- j i
lion tras led u^ to where we now are The very first it
charge that the late President ever brought against ¡
the bank, was, that it had not maintained a sound and
vmfoim currency Most person'., probably, will
think the charge quite unfounded, yet this was the
charge Its dereliction of duly, or its want of abi-
lity to perform what had been expected from it—
its failure, in some way, to maintain a ,gooü cur-
rensy, was the original professed cause of dissatis-
faction And when the bill for rcchartenng the bank
was negatived, it was not on the ground that Govern-
ment had nothing to do with the national curren-
cy, but that a better provision for it might be made
than we had in the bank The duty was not to be
disclaimed, or thrown off, or neglected, newagents,
only, were to be employed, that it might be better
performed The State banks would do better than
me nationtl bank had done, the President \i as con
fident of this, and therefore he rejected the national
bank as an agent, and adopted the State banks
And what he so constantly promised us would hap-
pen, he as resolutelv maintained, afterwards, had
happened Down to his last message, down to the
last hour of his administration, he insisted upon it
thatthe State banks had fulfilled all his expectations,
and alt tl eir own duties, and had enab'ed the Go-
vernmeut to acoomplisn, m the very best mam ei,
the great and lmpoi taut object1- of «urrency and ex-
chaage We have the same head of the Treasury,
sir, w ho has repeated and echoed all these state-
ments, whether of piopheay or fulfilment, in suc-
cessive reports, some of them not less tersely and
intelligibly w ntten than that now before us, and '
we have heads of other departments who concur-
red, I presume, from time to time, in the oiigmal
statements, and in the faithful echoes of them,
from the Tieasury All these functionar es have
been laboring with the utmost ¿eal, as they pro-
fessed, to perform then constitutional ob'isaaon of
luinishmg the country with a good cunency, with
a better currency with the best currency, and
they have dragged Congress, dragged the country,
and dragged themselves, into difficulty, perplexity,
and distress, m this long and hot pursuit And
now, behold, they draw up all at once, and declare
that the object of all this toil and struggle is one
with which they have nothing at all to do'
But, as the last Message of the late President
was loud and warm in its praises of the State
banks, for the good services which thty rendered
to currency and exchange, so, no doubt w ould the
first Message of the present Prtsident ba>e com-
mended, with equal earnestness, the success with
which Government had been able, by means of the '
State banks, to discharge this important pait of its
duties, if the events of May last had not left that
subject no longer a topic of felicitation By the
suspension of specie payments, all vv as changed
The duty of Government was changed, and the
Constitution was ohanged also Government was
now to give up, and abandon for ever, that very
thing winch had been the professed object of its
moot assiduous care, and most earnest pursuit, for
eight long and arduous years'
Mr President, when I heard of the suspen ion of
she baris, I was by the side of the Ohio, on a jour-
ney, in the eoir e of which I had occasion, fre
qutntly, to express my opinion on this new state oí
things, and tho«e who may have heard m°, or
noticed my i email s, will bear witness th t I con-
stantly expressed the option that a new era had
commenced , that a question of principle, and a
question of me highest ímpoitanc, hod arisen, or
would immediate'y arise, that nereafter the dis-
pute would not be so much about means as ends,
that the extent of the constitutional obligation of
the Government would be controverted, m short,
that the question whedier it was the duty of Con-
gress to concern itself with the nat onal currency,
must, inevitably, become the leading topic of tie
times So I thought whenever I had the plea ure
of addiessmg my fellow citizens, and so I feel and
think now I said often on these occas ons,
and I say now, that it is a question which the
peop'e, Ly tne rutilar exeicse of the r ckctive
franchise, must decidí The subject is one <i so
much permanent importance, and public mcr have
become so committed, on the one „ide or the other,
that the decision must, as I think, be made by
the country We see an entirely new state of
things We behold new and untried principles of
administration advanced and adop'ed We wit
ness an aiowed and bold rejection of the policy
hitneno always pievailm . The Government has
come, not to a paus , but to a levulsion It not
only stops, but it starts back, it abandons the course,
which i has been pursuing for near fifty jea]s,?nd
it reproicnes l'self with having been acting all that
time, beyond the limits of its constitutional power
It was my second proposition, sir, thit the Mes-
sage, the bill, and the amendment, taken toaethei,
deny, in substance, that this Government has
any power or duty connected with the cu'reicy,
or the exchanges, beyond the meie legulation of
the coins
And, sir, s this not true1 We are to judge of
the Message by w hat it omits, as well as by what it
ptoposes Congress is calKl loge hei in a gieat
commere al crisis. The whoe business ot the
country is arrested by a sudden disoider of the
cmrency And what is proposed? Any thing to
nstore this currency Any Ih ng with a dnect
v ew of producing the resumption of pavment bj
the banks? Is a single measine offered, 01 sug-
gested, the main purpose of which is aenei ii re-
lief to the countij? Wit one No, sir, not one
The administration confines itsmeiHiresto the Go-
vernment itself It pioposes a loan, by the means
of Treasury notes, to make good the deficiency m
the re\enue, and it proposes secuie \auls and
- rong boxes, foi the sife-keeping of the pubhi
mone>s, and hcie its paterurl caieeids Do s the
Message propose to grapple, in an) wav, with the
main evil of the times? Seeing that that evil is
one affecting the cunency, dce5 the Message 1 ke
that of Mi Madison, in 181), adi re sit eifdirut

ril relief It h oks out for the interest of the Go-
vernment, as a Government, and it looks no fur-
ther Sir, let me turn to the message itself, to
show that all its recommendations, and, indeed, all
the objects in calling Congress together, are confined
to the narrow and excusive purpose of relieving
the wants of Government
The Pres dent says that the regulations estab
lished by Congress for the deposite and safe-kecp-
mg of the public money s ha\ in; become inopera-
tive by the suspension of payment by the banks,
and appiehending that the same cause would so
d minish the re enuo tint the receipts mti th°
Treasury would nit be sufficient to defray the ex-
penses of Government, and as questions were a'so
expected to alise respecting the October ínsta'ment
of the deposite to the Stales, and doubting whether
Goveinment would be able to pay its cieditoi  in
specie, or its eamvalent, according to lm,hefcli
it be his duty to call Congress together These aie
the reasons (or ctl nig C n^res Thev aie ai

Inthent t place, let us see what i le isure h=
MesjT^e lec m lien Is to C rgress In its own
language, the objects demanding itsaltention are—
"To regulate, by law, the "nfe-keeping, tiansfer,
and disbursement of the public moncv , lodes g-
ii U the funds to be received and paid by die Go-
\emmnt,tc enable the Treasun tome1  prompt y

And now, sir, Jet ns si    ( i \  iat  sn unds i  is

d mes i or iuti n  cxcls"?      It is, it d el ii
ihoiued to regíate,by law, the commerce between
the S ates, and to proviele a general standard of
value or medium ot exchange in gold and silver,
but it is not its piovince to aid individuals in the
tiansfer of their iunds, otherwise than through the
facilities afforded by the Post Office Depaitment
Vs justly might it be called on to provide for the
transportation of their merchandise "
And again
" If, therefoie, I refrain from suggesting to Con-
gress any specific plan for regulating the exchanges
of the countiy, relieving mercantile embirrass-
ments, oi interfering with the ordinary operations
of foie gn or domestic commeice, it is from a con-
viction that such measmes are not within the con-
stitutional province of the General Government,
and that their adoption would not promote the real
and peí manent w clfaie of those they might be de-
signed to aid "
Tht Presidert, then str, declines to recommend
any measure foi the relief of commerce, for the rt-
s oiation of the currency, or for the benefit of ex-
changes, on the avowed ground, that, in his opi-
nion, such measures are not within the constitutior-
al pow er of Congress, He is distinct and explicit,
and so fai entitleel to credit He denies, broadly
and flatly, that theie is any authority in this Go-
vemmen to regulate the cunency and the ex-
changes, bey end ihe cart of the com The ques-
t on, then, is fairly staled It can not be misunder-
stood, and we are now to see how Congess, and,
what is much more important, how the country will
settle it
Mr Piesident, if, in May last, when specie pay-
ments were suspenefed, the piesident of oneoi the
ban! s had cal'ed his council of duectors together,
informed tVm tiat their affairs were thteatened
wi'h elinger, hat they conhl not collect their debts
in speeie,?i d might not be able to pay their cred-
* ism sr cie, and recoxmended s teh neasures as
he t ou lit tieii interest requited hispo "y, in all
tin , non d base been no n oie exclusively confin-
ed to the interests of his corporation than the policy
of the Message is confined to the interests of this
great corporation of Government Both in prac-
tice, thtrefore, and on principle, m reality, and
avowedly , the administration abandors the currency
to its fate It surrenders all care over it, declines
all concern about it, and denies that it has any
duty connected with it
Sir, the question then comes to b  thts Shall one
of the great ponéis of the Constitution, a power
essen* al to it, on any just plan oi theory of Go-
veinment, a power which has been exercised fiom
the bcgtnm g, a povvei absolutely necessary and
ind peisab e to the propel legulai on of the com-
merce of the countiy, be new surrendered and
aban loned foi evei? To ti s point we h? i e come,
