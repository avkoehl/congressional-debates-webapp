Brigadier General J. P. HATCH,

Commanding Department of the South:

GENERAL: I transmit for your perusal a letter* which was handed me after seeing you yesterday. Is it your impression from this and your own information that the rebels will be likely to increase the force of Sumter so as to render it a serious inconvenience to the works ashore or to the vessels? I would suggest, is consistent with your own views, that General Schimmelfennig be requested to come here and give his views personally. Will you do me the favor to return the letter after perusal?

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. DAHLGREN,

Rear-Admiral, Commanding South Atlantic Blockading Squadron.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, S. C., May 5, 1864.

Rear-Admiral J. A. DAHLGREN,

Commanding South Atlantic Blockading Squadron:

ADMIRAL: In answer to your letter of this morning, I must say that I believe that the intention of the enemy is, if possible, to draw us from the north end of Morris Island. It is probable that should they succeed so far as to silence our water, batteries, they may cross to make a successful raid upon the squadron. General Schimmelfennig will be directed to come here for conference, as you suggest.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. P. HATCH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
