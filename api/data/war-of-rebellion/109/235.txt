HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST TENNESSEE,Pittsburg, April 12, 1862.

[General THOMAS:]

GENERAL: I am directed by Major-General Halleck to organize a force for special service to-night. You will therefore report one brigade of your command on board the steamers White Cloud and Universe this evening with one days' rations. The lateness of the hour prevents sending this through Major-General Buell, commanding. You will please therefore notify him of this detail. No artillery and but one company of cavalry will be required. Instructions will be given after your troops are embarked.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

Washington, D. C., April 13, 1862-10.15 a. M.

THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary, New Madrid:

I would be glat if you would give more full and detailed information in respect to army movements and military operations than I have been favored with of late. Your dispatches are so few and so meager as to afford very little information to this Department, and as the object of your mission was to obtain accurate and full details, I have been much disappointed.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
