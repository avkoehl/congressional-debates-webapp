BURNING OF THE GAROJINE
.The resolution submit ed by Mr Allex on Friday last, was
ta%n up and read, as foi ows
Besolúed, That the Presiden* of the United States be re-
quested $> inform the Senate, if, in his opim ni, it may be done
without detriment to the public mteiest, what proceedings, if
any, h%v| taken place between this a d the British Government
íelativeJo the matter ofthe Caroline, and the arrest and de
mand offácLeod, since the date of his last communication on
this subject, and to lay before the ¡senate a copy of the corre
spondence which may, sub equently to ihatdate, have passed
between these Governments relative to the same matter*?
Mr RIVES doubted the propriety of the passage of the reso-
lution at this time when the negotiation was now pending.
Th" President ofthe United states he said, in his last message
upon the subject, had informed the senate ofthe delicate and
important nature of the question involved, and that negotia-
tion upon th<- subject was m progress and was not then termi-
nated, ml held out the expectation that when ltwaseompleted
further communication would be made It it was a question
of so much delicacy at the time of that message, at the com-
mencement of the session, it was still more so now, when the
negotiation must have arrived almost at its crisis He also re-
marked that a special mission had been appointed by England
to adjustall the matters mdispute, and it would therefore be
doubly inopportune todo any act which would in the slightest
degiee tend to embarrass the negotiation He thought it highly
improper to make the call at that time, and moved to Iay°the
resolu ion on the tab e but withdrew the motion at the sue
gestión of
Mr ALT N, who said that one material fact «cerned to have
been entirely o veilooked by the Senatoi from Virginia, and it was
tn the resolution is made conditional, and requests the Presi
dent to make this communication to the Senate orly incase in
his judgment, it may be dune without prejudice to the public'm
tereists This re^eivatio i was om which was invariably made
inca&eswhere information of this kind was asked lor, forthe
reason tha the President may have a knowledge of facts which
would make it imprudent to give publicity to matters which
form the subject of negotiation with foreign Governments This
fact, therefore, it seemei1 to him, would be a&uftrcientanswer to
the ob]ecuon& made by the senator f om Virginia But he (Mr
Allen) did not believe that the publication of those regotiations
which had taken, place between the Executive Department of
this Government and thellnti i Government upon this subject
could by any possibility n fltct an imuiv upon the interests of
this Government iney had had the facts already communi
cated, the chief purport of those facts being the invasion of our
terruorj the burning of cur propeity, and the murderof our
people bv subjectsof the Bntish Government The country had
seen the Ik od uf hei citizens shed nd other outrages committed,
and although foui yeai^ ha 1 passed away srnce the perpetra'
tion of those acta, they io not yet know whether even the sha-
dow of an apology has been made for them They had s°en the
culpnt, oi supposed culprit, demanded befoie hit> innocence
coiikl be attested by a legal investiga ion and they had seen in
inswer to tha demand a concession made, which he believed
wa-> not justifiable either in refer me to the facts of the ca^e* or
of international law, applicable to these facts—that it would be
the duty of this Government to surrender the accused, if the re
sponMbilitv of theacts weie assumed by Great Britain The
w lole matter, fiom beginning to end had been, m his opi-
nion, treated w>th the most peilec: indifference to the
interest as well as the honor of this Government, and in such
a manner as he believed the people would not much longer to-
lerate He asked fb the mfurmat on because he wished toas
certain the «tate of the negotiation at this time, to see what the
British Government had proposed to do in reference to these
aggressions, now that the culprit, or rather the accused, had
