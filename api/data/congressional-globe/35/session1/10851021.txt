PATENT OFFICE REPORT,
On motion of Mr. JOHNSON, of Arkansas,
the Senate resumed the consideration of the res-
olution, which was reported by him on Monday
last from the Committee on Printing, to prmtten
thousand copies of the i>port of the Commissioner
of Patents, for the year 1857, on arts and manu-
factures.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Arkansas. I wish to state
but one or two points in regard to tins subject,
and then I shall ask for the action ot" the Senate,
which I hope we shall be able to get before the
exoiration of the morning hour. The whole
body are familiar, at least to some extent, with
the subject of public printing, and the abuses and
extravagance that have attended it. The com-
mittee propose to cut down the number of copies
of this document, printed by order ot the Senate,
from twenty-seven thousand to ten thousand.
The saving that will be achieved by this reduc-
tion will be upwards of thirty thousand dollars.
The number which will iuure to each Senator for
the purpose of distribution among his constitu-
ents will be about one hundred and thirty, sup-
posing eight thousand to be printed for the use of
the Senator;,; and, besides, we propose to furnish
two thousand copies to the Interior Department,
which may, under a proper system of distribu-
tion, dispose of them for the public good.
There is, then, a saving proposed by the commit-
tee to this extent. Gentlemen can give it what
value and whatconsideration they please. If they
cannot support the Committee on Printing in their
efforts to reduce the expenditures which have been
so enormous hitherto to this branch of the public
service, the committee may come to the conclu-
sion that they may as well cease to speak of tho
abuses of the system. The committee think that
from one hundred and twenty-iiveto one hundred
and thirty copies to each Senator are sufficient.
We are now aware that a vast number of these
PatentOffice reports are lost altogether to the pub-
lic service. Senators are aware of the fact that
they can be bought throughout this city, at least
in a number of places, for fifteen cents per copy.
I am assured, since I made this remark the other
day, that they have been repeatedly bought at a
less price than that; and yet they cost Congress
some seventy cents a volume to print them in the
first place.
An amendment was offered on Monday by
the Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr. Wilson,]
which he, at the proper time, will explain. I shall
support the amendment, and I believe it ought to
be adopted.
Mr. CAMERON. The cost of congressional
printing has suddenly increased so largely as to
be now a subject of serious interest to the whole
country.
In 1847, only eleven years ago, the whole sum
paid for paper, printing, and binding amounted
only to ij>64,691 96. This was under the contract
system, when the work was given to tho lowest
bidder. Some three or four years later, this sys-
tem was changed, at the instance, mainly, of per-
sons interested in high prices.
The new system was a mixed one. The prices
were fixed by the law, and the Government under
it has become the purchaser of paper and other
materials. The office of Superintendent of Print-
ing lias been established, and that officer become
a functionary of the Government, in many in-
stances irresponsible to any authority, though
nominally responsible to the Committee on Print-
ing of each House. He buys the paper, orders
the engravings, and controls the expenditure of
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
It is not my purpose to inquire into the manner
in which the duties of that office have been ful-
filled; much less is it my wish to impute willful
wrong to any one connected with the management
of the public printing. I desire only to draw the
attention of the Senate to the enormous cost of
the work, with the hope that the present com-
mittee will be sustained m their labors of retrench-
ment.
The cost of printing, paper, and binding, from
July 1, 1656, to March 4, 1857, amounted to the
sum of $1,958,210 42. The binding, alone, for
that period, it will be seen, was more than six times
as much as the whole cost of paper, printing, and
i binding for the year 184T.
The cost for the year just ended I have not beer*
able to obtain; but it is probably over a million
and a half of dollars.
A great deal of this extravagance of expendi-
ture has arisen from the loose manner in which1
Congress has ordered the printing oi reports by
otricers of the Ai my and Navy, and other func,-
tuiiiaues sent upon exploring duties. It has been
enumion, as I am told, to direct the printing of
such reports without examination, permitting the
officer to complete his report while the work is
progressing m the hands of the Printer. Sueh has
been the course with the Coast Survey, the Japan
expedition, the Mississippi and Pacific jailioad
report, and many others.
The Coast Survey report cost, for printing and
materials, for the year 1856, the enormous sum
of $78,441 70.
Giiliss's report has already cost over one hun-
dred thousand dollars; and the estimated cost of
the whole work as ordered is ยง149,107 97.
The Japan expedition report, which has-been
completed and paid for,cost the sum of ยง240,486 72.
Of Emory's Mexican boundary report, one
volume has been printed, and has already cost
$107,580; the second volume has been ordered,
and is estimated to cost $104,5)0โmaking, m all,
the sum of $212,000 for that work.
But the Pacific railroad report is beyond all
