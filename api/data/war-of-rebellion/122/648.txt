cannot be restored. On the whole, the arrangement made is the proper one, and to the Federal Government eminently just. I assumed responsibilities, and have no interest or passion to gratify. If the impression gets through the skeletons of regiments and companies in the State that they can appeal to Washington when I order them to consolidate, I will be powerless. If possible, do send us some guns. Can you not give us some of the Enfield, or other guns as good? That was a very good arrangement made for Rippey's, McLane's, and Mann's regiments.

Honorable A. G. CURTIN, Harrisburg:

Fill up Colonel Power's regiment and send it. Do whatever you may think necessary to get the men into the field.

THOMAS A. SCOTT:

You will do me a great favor if you will send some of our regiments, about to start, South, particularly Hartranft's, which starts in morning. Power's, White's, Hartranft's, Guss', and Coulter's go to-day and to-morrow. Do have some good guns sent on at once.

Governor of Pennsylvania.

Honorable A. G. CURTIN, Harrisburg:

Please give me the order in which your regiments will leave Harrisburg. State name of colonel, number of men, and whether fully armed. We can use two or three regiments to go South. Answer immediately.

THOMAS A. SCOTT.

HARRISBURG, November 15, 1861.

Honorable T. A. SCOTT:

Hartranft's first, White's second, Coulter's third, fully armed. Power's and Guss' have gone, and McCarter's on Tuesday. The three last are not fully armed. The regiments average 950. I repeat my request for more arms.
