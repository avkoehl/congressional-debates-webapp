Colonel CHAMBLISS:

The post at Culpeper having been broken up, the general wishes you to cause cars, whenever reason exists to apprehend danger, to be run back. He wishes nothing accumulated in front which it would be necessary to abandon; but, if more convenient for you, does not object to your using the store-house for any small supplies which can be readily loaded and run back, if necessary.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,R. H. CHILTON,

Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General.
