to the Old Capitol Prison. The papers are for the most part letters from distinguished men for his release, testifying to the loyalty, &amp;c., of McMurdy, his family and friends. Also a report dated Provost - Marshal's Office, Washington, D. C. October 30, 1861, signed E. J. Allen, stating that McMurdy has been released by order of the Secretary of War.

This person [Thomas White] was arrestes as appears by a letter from his brother - in - law, R. W. White, forwarded to procure his release on parole, on the steamer Platte Valley in November, 1861. The said letter represents that he was confined in military Prison at Saint Louis. There is no other or further information about the man in the Department of State, wherefore it is inferred that he was held by the military autorities either as a prisoner of war of for some military offense.

Ewdard B. Cuthbert, of Beaufort, S. C., was taken prisoner at Port Royal of Ladies Island nea Port Royal, in November, 1861, and sent to Fort Lafayette. The Department of State has not received any information from the military authorities in regard to this prisoner placing him in any different light from that occupied by others captured by them. A statement made on behalf of the prisoner by his wife shows that he escaped to Charleston after the bombardment of Port Royal and returned voluntarily on his own business as she alleges when he was taken. It does not appear whether or not be entered within the lines of the Government forces before he was captured. His wife says he was unarmed, though it would seem from her statement that he made resustance as she says he was " overpowered. " No allegation of criminality as a spy has been made against him nor it is known that he is in any other way culpable than as a rebel in common with all the residents of Beaufort and vicinity. The said Cuthbert remained in custody at Fort Lafayette February 15, 1862, when in conformity with the order of the War Department of the preceding day he was transferred to the charge of that Department.

W. Oswald Dundas * was arrested November 1, 1861, on complaint of Major De Zeng, or the First Long Island Volunteers, and confined in the Thirteenth Street Prison in Washington, D. C., and was transferred to the Old Capitol Prison November 7, 1861. Dundas was in the habit id leaving his home near Bladensburg, Md., early in the evening on horseback and returning late at night. When arrested he claimed to be a gentleman a right to go where he chose; that he was not in favor of the United States Government for it oppressed his ocuntrymen and admitted that he was a secessionist. Dundas refused to take the oath of allegiance to the Federal Government but would cheerfully swear to support the so - called Confederate States Constitution and was proud to be called a rebel under the present existing circumstances. He remained confined in the Old Capitol Prison February 15, 1862, when in accordance with an order of the War Department of the preceding day he was transferred to the charge of that Department.
