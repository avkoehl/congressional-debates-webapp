General GILLMORE:

We have dismounted two guns on Sumter and injured one this a.m. But two remain. We are firing with great accuracy.

LOOKOUT.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, September 1, 1863-12.15 p.m.

General GILLMORE:

I am glad the batteries are doing good execution. I hope you will give me the full benefit of your fire, as I intend to be in action tonight, if nothing prevents. I would advise great care in handling the hand-grenades, as 1 of my men was killed and 2 wounded by a very ordinary accident.

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.

MORRIS ISLAND, September 1, 1863-1.40 p.m.

Admiral DAHLGREN:

I have ordered all the heavy guns to operate on Sumter until dark. Many of them are considered unsafe, and must be fired with a slowmatch. My lookout reports the firing to-day as remarkably accurate.

GILLMORE,

General.
