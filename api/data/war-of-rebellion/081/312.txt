in my front. My artillery will compel the enemy to keep the force now in front of me where it is, as the cannot move it out of the intrenchments in daylight, our command of the ground being too complete. Even our musketry reaches the ground he would have to move over.

General WARREN:

I think it would be advisable to move the two brigades you can spare to the rear of Griffin's left. Gibbon and Barlow have both been broken, but now repaired, but if a formidable attack is made we shall require support. Let the brigade commander report to General Birney, who is near the Jones house on the plank road.
