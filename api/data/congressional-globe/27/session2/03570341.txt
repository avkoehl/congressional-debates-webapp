Mr CLAÍ said ho should be extremely happyto learn the
wishes of the Senate, or of individual members, as to a desire
which they misht entertain of addressing the Senate further
upon the subject of mese resolutions If any such desire exieU
ed, of course he had no disposition to oppose the slightest obsta-
cle, b it ii no Senator intended to pursue the dissussion, he
would 1 ke to say a few woide m conclusion of the debate, but
in enrsi ration of the lateness of the hour, he would defer what
he had to say until to morrow
Mi WRIGHT said, in oiderthat the Senator might labor un-
der no misapprehension, he would stale that he had no desire to
pursue the general debate further, but the Senator must be
aware that when the amendments came to be considered, they
would without doubt produce a conversational debate.
Mr RIVLS said it was rot his intention to prolong the pre-
sent discussion, but he desired to have an opportunity of sub-
mitting somt amendments to the resolutions, in order to record
the views I e entertained upon the subject
■Vn CLAY observed that he should not, certainly, rxnsider
the conree which was susgested by the Senator from Virginia
asatalldepaiting from the proper courtesy and custom upon
such occasions The first question, however, would be upon
the amendments proposed by the Senator from Hew
toik, unless it were proposed to amend his amend-
ments He rose, however, more for the purpose of
saying that if u should meet the views of the Se-
nate, as he hoped it would, the debate should be closed, and
that they should defer taking the final question until Tuesday
next <bi teesons which he believed the Senate would appreci-
ate it v as desirable to have a full expression of the sense of
that bo'y upon the resolutions and as threo Senators
weie iHnvoiddbly absent, it woujl be proper that the vote
