Major General H. W. HALLECK:

If General Foster is relieved General McPherson or General Schofield would suit me to fill his place, but both are ranked by generals already in the Department of the Ohio. I would recommend, therefore, the appointment of General W. F. Smith to major-general, and rank dated back to his first appointment and he given the command. If it is in contemplation to give General Smith a higher command, either of the officers named or General Parke will suit me.

U. S. GRANT,
