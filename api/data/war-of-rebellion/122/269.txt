EXECUTIVE MANSION,

June 13, 1861.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR:

MY DEAR SIR: There is, it seems, a regiment in Massachusetts commanded by Fletcher Webster, and which Honorable Daniel Webster's old friends very much wish to get into the service. If it can be received with the approval of your Department and the consent of the Governor of Massachusetts I shall indeed be much gratified. Give Mr. Ashmun a chance to explain fully.

Yours, truly,

A. LINCOLN.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR:

MY DEAR SIR: I think it is entirely safe to accept a fifth regiment form Michigan, and with your approbation I should say a regiment presented by Colonel T. B. Stockton, ready for service within two weeks from now, will be received. Look at Colonel Stockton's testimonials.

Yours, truly,

A. LINCOLN.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, June 13, 1861.

Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD,

Secretary of State:

SIR: This Department wishes to procure from France a sample of Napoleon gun, or one of each caliber, both rifled and smooth bored, if there be more than one caliber and kind. Will you be so good as to make known to the U. S. minister at Paris the wishes of the Department in this respect and to request his aid in carrying them out? As you will see by the inclosed copy of a letter from Mr. Forbes,* Mr. W. S. Stilman is recommended as a suitable agent to procure the sample gun or guns.

As regards payment, I would suggest, as probably the most convenient way, that our minister be authorized to make a draft on this Department of the amount, to be charged to appropriation for ordnance and ordnance stores and supplies. It will be well to procure also samples of projectiles for rifled cannon of different kinds, if there be more than one, which are used in the French service, with notes as to the modes of rifling both field and heavy cannon and of using them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

DETROIT, MICH., Juneorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

The Third Michigan Regiment leaves to-day for Washington via Cleveland, Harrisburg, and Baltimore, fully equipped and armed, including ammunition.

JOHN ROBERTSON,

Adjutant-General.
