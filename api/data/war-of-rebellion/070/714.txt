RICHMOND, May 4, 1864.

Major General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Dublin:

General William E. Jones will not move so as to endanger the iron or salt-works. His instructions have been modified in reply to his dispatch, but enemy is pressing on Johnston from Knoxville, and nothing short of sternest necessity should keep Jones from following. He should also thereby cover roads into North Carolina to prevent cavalry raids feared there. Telegraph a reply.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.

[Indorsement.]

MAY 4, 1864-9.30 p. m.

Will answer as soon as General Lee answers my dispatch of this date. Have dispatched General Jones to wait till I hear from General Lee.

J. C. B.

Answered this May 5, after receiving General Lee's dispatches.

Major-General BRECKINRIDGE,

I am ordered by General by General Bragg to push my cavalry forward in Tennessee. I have notified him of the state of affairs here and asked if I must withdraw my support to you. My bridge will be near Jeffersonville to-day. Morgan is near Saltville. Both are to move to you if needed.
