thesesettlers In thefirst place,theFlondasettlers
are to be—not soldiers—but cultivators, the land
they are to receive is nota bounty for enlistment,
but the pay which they are to receive at the end
of then service It is the object for which they
labor, and the íewaid which is to compensate
them foi their toil and risk They go to the
counti y to get it. They stay theie until they get
it They choose it themselves, and, when they
choose it, it is to live upon it How different
was the case of the soldiers ftom all this They
had no choice of their land, it was distiibuted to
them by lot, (yid tens of thousands of the grants
were not worth a cent, the soldiers were at an
lmmensedistancefiomthe land—a thousand miles
ormore ftom it—they knew nothing about it—in
many instances weie not able to get to it—they
were beset by temptations and dn>couiagemeitts
—and gave up for a trifle what they knew noth-
ing about A most defective law permitted eva
sions, and the sales, though nominally declared
void before the patent issued, weie easily made
to assume a valid foini
All this is different in this bill These settlers
■will not be, like disbanded soldiers, scattered
ihiough the towns and cities, a piey to specu
lators, but they will be at their stations in Flouda
—in then block houses among Indians—when
no speculator will overcome Instead of a lottery
drawn by a boy to distribute unknown Undt.

Having read these sections of the bill, Mr B
appealed to the Senate to say if the objection of
the Senator from Kentucky was not entirely in-
applicable The case was wholly different from
that of soldiers of the regular Army What
happened to these soldiers cannot happen to the
settlers under the bill They would not sell their
lands for a tnfle, if they could, and they could
not, if they would The widow and the heirs
at law, oi the settler himself, or any subsequent
purchnsei, aftei the land was alienable, c in easily
set aside the sale and that without limitation of
time, and recovei m the same suit, all the nilei-
mediate rents and piofits If the soldleis'bounty
lands of the late war had been placed under the
same guaitls, and they had been rtquutd to go
and make then own selections and then own en
tiles, they would never have been squandered

INTERI ERLNCf IN EI ECTIONS
SPEECH OF HON. J. C  CALHOUN,
OP  SOUTH  CAROLINA,
In the Sfnate, Februaty 22, 1839,
On the bill to pre vent the interference of certain federal
office is in elections
Mi   CALHOUN said
Mi  PuLsintNi   I bt long to that political school
which legalds with a jialous eyi the nationagc
of tins Government, and believes that the less its
putionage   the   bettii, consistently with the ob
¡e cts fot which  the Government was instituted
Ilms thinking, I have made  no political move of
any ímjioi tancc, for the   last twelve or tlinteen
years, which had  not for its  object, dneetly oi
iiidnectly, the reduction of patronage     But, not-
withstanding this, I cannot bung  my mind to
sujiport this bill, decidedly as 1 apjnove of its
object     Among othci difficulties, theie is a con-
stitutional objection, which I cannot suimount,
and which I Bhall, without furthei remaik, pro
cecd to state and consider
Thi3 bill jnoposcs to inflict the penalty of dis-
mission on a large class of the officeis of this
Government, who shall electioneer, oi attempt
to control oi influence the election of public func
ttonarics either of the General oi State Govern
ments, without distinguishing between then of-
ficial and individual character as citizens and the
question is, has Congress the constitutional light
to pass such a law' I hat, again, involves a
pi tor and still more genet al question has this
Government the authority to ntteifcie with the
electoial lights of the citizens of the States?
In considering tins general question, I shall
assume, in the fiist place, what none will deny,
that it belongs to the States sejiarately to determ-
ine who shall, and who shall not, exercise the
right of suffiage, and, in the second, that it be-
longs to them, in like mannei, to regulate that
light, that is, to pass all laws that may be neces-
sary to secute its fiee exeicise on the one hand,
and to pievent its abuse on the othei I next ad-
vance the proposition, which no one in the least
conversant with our institution?, orfamihai with
the Constitution, will ventuie to question, that as
fdi as citi-ens aieconcerned, ¡/us light belong?solely
to the States, to the entue exclusion of the Geneial
Government, which can in nowise touch or mtei-
ferc with it without tianscending the limits of
the Constitution Thus fai theie can be no dif-
feience of opinion
But a citizen may be also an officei of this Gov-
ernment, which bungs up the question, has it the
light to make it penal for him to use his official
power to control or influence elections > Can it,
for instance, make it penal in a collector, or other
officer, who holdsabond, in his official character,
on a citizen, to threaten to enforce it, if he should
refuse to vote for his favorite candidate? 1 regaid
this proposition as not less clear than the pre-
ceding Whenever the Government invests an
individual with power, which may be used to
the injury of othei3, or the public, it is manifest
that it not only has the right, but that it is in
duty bound to prevent its abuse as far as prac-
ticable But it must be borne m mind that a cit-
izen does not cease to be one in becoming a Fed-
eial officer This Government must, accoidingly,
take special care, in subjecting him to penalties
for the abuse of his official powers, that it does
not lnterfeie in any wise with his private rights
as a citizen, and which are, as has been stated,
under the exclusive contiol of the States. But
no such care is taken either in this bill or the
substitute proposed by its author N either makes
any distinction whatever between the official and
private acts of the officer as a citizen The bioadest
and most comprehensive terms are used, compre-
hending and subjecting all acts, without disciím-
ination as to chaiacter, to the proposed penalty.
Under its piovisions, if an officer should express
an opinion of any candidate, sav of a President
who was a candidate for reelection, whether fa-
voiable oi unfavorable, or to whisper an opinion
i elating to his administration, whether good or
bad, he would subject himself to the penalty of
this bill, as certainly as if he had brought the
whole of his official power to bear directly on the
fieedom of election That a bill containing such
broad and indiscriminate provisions, transcends
the powers of Congress, and violates, in the offi-
cer, the electoral lights of the citizen, held under
the authority of his State, and guarantied by the
piovision of the Constitution which secures the
iitedom of speech to all, is too clear, after what
has been said, to require additional illustration
It cannot pass without enlarging the power of the
Government by the abridgment of the rights of
the citizen
But, it may be replied, that there are instances
where the Government has subjected its officers
to jxnalties foi acts of a private character, over
which the Constitution has given it no contiol
Such undoubtedly is the fact, and its right to do
so, in the instances íeferred o in the discussion,
cannot be denied, but all such cases are distin-
guished ftom that under consideiation bylines
too bioad to be mistaken In all of them the acts
piohibitcd were, in the first place, such as were
incompatible with the official duties enjoined, as
in the case of the prohibition of commissaues to
purchase oi deal m articles similai to thoi>e that
aie made then official duty to puichase, m order
to prevent fiaud on the public And in the nett,
the acts prohibited involved only civil lights, be-
longing to the officer as an individual, and not
political lights, which belong to him as a citizen,
riie foimci he may yield at nleasuie, without dis-
cieditor dibgiace, u«t the latter he cannot sut-
íendei without debasing himself, and giving up a
sacied ttust vested in him, bythe Slate of which
he is a member, for the common good, nor can
this Govemment demand its suitendei, without
tianscending its powers and lnfungmg the rights
of the States and their citizens
It may also be said that, in mosteases, it would
be impossible to distinguish between the official
and the political acts of the officer, so as to sub-
ject the foimer to penal restraints without inter-
fering with the lattei, and that it would, in prac-
tice, lender ineffective the admitted right of the
Government to punish its officers for the abuse
of their official poweis It may be so, but little
or no evil can result Whatever defect of right
this Government may laborunder, m such cases,
is amply made up by the plenary power of the
States, which has an unlimited control ovei tie
electoral rights of its citizens, whethei officeis of
this Government or not To them the subject
may be safely confided It is they who are par-
ticularly inteiestcd in seeingthatarightso sacied
shall not be abused, noi the fieedom of election
be impaiied We must notfoiget that States, and
the people of the States aie our constituent  and
supeuois,and wc but their agents, and that if the
light in question be abused, oi  the fieedom of
