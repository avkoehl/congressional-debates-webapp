Some citizens of Loudoun have proposed to me that if I will arm then and give them the means of living away from home for awhile they will kill or capture the band. The band consists of Mobberly, Riley, S. Mocks, and Tribbet. All of them have murdered our soldiers time and again. The band originally consisted of about fifteen men. During the last summer we have killed most of the band, leaving these four men, who are the head devils of the concern. I think promising these men a reward of $500 for each of the others, dead or alive, will clean out the concern. The Government could readily afford to pay $50,000 for them and save the amount in the prevention of the destruction of public property in six months' operations of the band.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION, April 1, 1865.

General STEVENSON:

With reference to your dispatch of this morning the general desires me to say that you can arm and subsist the men you refer to, if you are satisfied that it is for the interest of the service. He does not think it proper to offer a reward openly, but will reward the men liberally in proportion to the service they may render. From all he can learn he regards the men of Mobberly's gang as outlaws, and if the citizens desire to rid themselves of them the general will assist them liberally, and the men engaged, besides their reward, shall be provided for while it is necessary for them to remain away from home. The general desires that the whole matter shall be kept secret.

Captain Guion informs me that there is a rebel force of about 200 in the vicinity of Gauley. They were at Mountain Cove at 4 p.m. They are Amick's, Alstead's, and Thurmond's men, or so reported. I have sent re-enforcements to Gauley.

LOUP CREEK, April 1, 1865.

Colonel J. H. OLEY,

Commanding, &c. Charleston:

I have just learned that a party of rebels under Captain Amick has been committing some depredations in Nicholas County, in the vicinity of Captains Mann's and Ramsay's camps, their men being absent in Greenbrier at the time. There were about forty of the rebels. The most damage done by them was stealing a few horses. They did not stay long.
