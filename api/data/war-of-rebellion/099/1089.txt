R. F. HOKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS HOKE'S DIVISION,February 3, 1865.

Colonel ANDERSON,

Assistnt Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have been disapproving applications made by officers for furloghs because the number absent now is far greater in proportion to that of the men. The state of feeling of our troops is such that we should guard against all reasons for complaint. The effect is bad when men see that officers are allowed to go home indiscriminately. I am indused to change any opinion about the division infirmary, and will give the matter a personal inspection if you can postpone action for a day or so, but if it is brokenup the most stringent orders will have to be given to transfers. Will the hospitals of the city fafford accommodations for the sick and convalescent? If an action should take place hospital room would be wanted, and all occupants would at once be transferred, but this we can discuss unless you desire immediate action.

Very respectfully, yours,

R. F. HOKE,

Major-General.
