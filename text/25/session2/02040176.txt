Mr GILLEY and Mr WISE made some mu-
tual explanations
_ Mr LOOMIS said he should vote for this in-
vestigation, not upon ihe strength, however, of the
anonymous communication, but because the cha-
racter of members of the House was concerned
He was for investigating the subject in the most
direct manner possible, by bringing Mathew L.
Davis to the bar, and requiring him to testify as
to what he knew about that paper Mr L moved
an amend nent to that effect
Mr DUNCAN said he was opposed to going
into the investigation    We have come here for
higher and more valuable purposes than to resolve
ourselves, da> after da/, into a court of inquiiy
to investígate our own characters, and at the ex-
pense of the public's money, and to ihe neglect of
the public business     He asked if the ¡ un had rose
during the present session vwthout bringing to light
some base calumny against some member of this
House, or the House aggregately, over the signature
of some one of the base, corrupt, and penniless scoun
drels who beset jour Capitohn hungryswarms  He
asked if it was intended to investigate every baso
charge that made its appearance, if so, we must
abandon the business of  the public entirely, how-
ever inteies in,' an 1 impoit ml it might be, and in-
stead of bung a. Huuie ot Representatives, consti-
tuted to sene the public, resolve ourselves into a
great couit of inquiry, not to try othei-, (the legiti-
mate object ot eveiy  judicial tnbunal,) but titiy
ourselves, and pronounce judgment in our own
case and behalf    Sir, I hope no such policy will
be adopted or commenced    This scurrilous, duty
communication is the  production of one who is
■well known by the term of the "Washington Spy '
This man, who now sits overlooking you from the
gallery, brooding calumny and detiaction, black,
base, and  foul, is  th"  apologist and eulogist of
Aaron  Burr—(He is wot thy of such a purpose )
But we are told by the gentleman from Maryland,
(Mr ÍENiprn,) that this investigation ought logo on,
the charge he understands to come from a respect-
able source    A resppctible somce1"    The gentle-
man from Maryland would  not  mike  the «.mo-
ment   of respectability, if  he knew the genonl
chaiacter of the "Washington Spy,"   he  would
not defame and  blacken  the term "respectable"
designedly, by applying it to a reich so ba.se and
degiaded as the Washington Spy now in my evt
Perhaps the ge llleman from Maryland has bet n
taugh', as has jour humble speaker, to revele the
head that is bald, and  the eye that is  dimmed by
age, and from this Kudible veneration was led to
the abuse of the term  "respect ible," of whnh he
has just been guilty     Sir, Elisha had a bald head,
he was a just man, and feared God, but does it
follow that every man who  has a bald head  is a
just man, and has the fear of God befóle his eyes,
or is entitled to the appellation of "respectable '
It is probable that   Elisha's eyes had giown dim,
and that if spectacles were in his day d scovoie I   ¡
lie wore them, but I mil f-k my fu>nd hom Mnj    i
land,if every  nnn   «ho   wears  «pedicles  is a 
honest an Ian upn"ht man      N ,  sir   nelim   i '

the coimlrj n quire,  tint  the autlnr of this hie
slander, is a seonn Iril,  aim, and a co   ard, than |
the fact that he  has  withheld his pi-«per name
If you hear of a man at the city < f Georgetown,
passing himself off by the name c f A B—at the citv
of Aletandna    by  the  name of C  D—at v< ui
Navy Yarl b, th« name ot L i — and at Bladens   :
birg by the n'ii e (t  G H, what othei concl ision I
would > iu be lile ¡   t> come to in reía ion to th-t
man, ot'er than that he is a horse thief, a coun-
lerfe ter or some b^se felon wh «merits i resident p
my our Dime,   pemtemi in     Surh k n 1 of chi-  ¡
ncter is pre-tnted to us in thepers n of the Wa'h- j
mgton Spy       Cut, sir, this is not the  place to ti 5,
him   I say we have higher duties to perform here
not  the duties that  appertain  to   oursehes,   but
those that appertain to the country
Further, sir I deny that any thing wnich th-
Washington Spy may say or publish is win thy ot
an investigation in this House or elsewhere I si}
so because I consider him so morally d prayed,
CONOHSSIOittL GLOBE,
and so degraded m the estimation of every honora-
ble and high-minded man, that he is literally mca-
ble of the crime of slander. I mean by this, sir,
that he is so notorious a liar, and so generally
known to be such, that he is incapable longer of
tellintr a falsehood. A gentleman asks me how
that can be. I answer, that a falsehood is a moral
perversion of the truth for the purpose of deception;
but the Washington Spy is so notorious and de-
graded a liar that he can no longer deceive; there-
fore, the object or purpose intended fading, the
falsehood fails with it Sir, I shall vote against
the original proposition, and if any member will
move to lay the proposition and all the proposed
amendments on the table, I will vote for the
motion.
Mr REED was in favor of investigation, but
not in the mode proposed by Mr Dromgoole, for
that would defeat the object intended.
Mr PRY said, according to his notion of this
matter, he thought the House would best maintain
its honor, its dignity, and its character, by abstain-
ing from any notice of the effusions of the newspa-
per scribblers who infest this hall, and treat such
publications with that contempt which they, when
impeaching any of the members, ceitainly meiit
If the editor of the New York C muer and En-
quner, or any other person, wishes to make a jour-
ney to this city, and remain heie a lew weeks in
th* chaiacter of a witness before this committee,
which it is. proposed to íaise, so as to come here at
the public expense, I, for one, am not disposed to
gratify them I do not say that is the design I
speak (or a contingency
If the "apparition" that has haunted this hall
since I hate been a member of this House, which
Ins been designated to me as the " Spy," h is any
chaise to make against any member ofthis House,
let him make it, let him publish his name, It I h m
openly accuse him of whatever crime with which
he may be chargt able If i membei wt re thus
charged, and thought himself aggiieved, and woo'd
ask an inquiry, I would giant it, but I am utterly
opposed to the House taking notice of any newspa-
per slang, to the exclusion of the important business
of the country In ordei, therefore, that the House
ma\ dispose of this subject, an 1 go on to refer Ihe
petitions which now load our tables, I mova the te-
s dution and amendment- lit on the table
Mr WISE asked for Ihe vas and nays, which
wcie orlered, and weie—jeas 14, nays 170
The question then tecurredupon Mr LOOMIS'S
amendment
Mr McKENNAN said the investigation hid
become neces ary, for olheiwise the charge might
rest upon himself, or upon the Speaker, or upon
anj other member
Mr TILLMORE was well assiiitd that the
House was not the proper body to investigue tilth
charge, though he thought it bctkr that the name
of the individual should be staled to the House,
and then the truth of the charge m ght be inquired
into bi a committee Mr F w is oppr< d to send-
ing 'lie ímttei to i seeiet committt e l) sit and i ol
1 et testimony on the character of an uid wtlnl
without his having an opportunity of I  ing h* aid
in his defence
Mr POPF was in favor of hiving the report of
a committee oí investigan n as a pieluninaiv sl p,
and then it would be the pr< p r time for the House
to take direct co-mi/anre of the subject
Mr THOMAS remarked upon the injustice
there had been done to som  one inemlvt of the
House whom he knew not, but the discussion
hav mg progressed 11 th s pi mt, he w ishrd the reso-
lution so amended as m cause, the untcr to app^ir

dressed to him m the gallery, and they proposed an
amendment in which his name was distinctly men-
tioned. Mr B. also went on to show that« would
be much more unjust to the person implicated to
have his name given at the bar, and heralded forth
upon every wind, than to have it disclosed to a
committee, which committee would instantly notify
him of the lact
Mr BYJNUM had no doubt the charge had been
made ft on a mere rumor, with no other founda-
tion, and to bring so lying a scamp as the propaga
(or to the bar oí the House, -would be only elevat-
ing him to consequence. A similar charge had
been made by another New York le'ter-wnter, that
the respectable member from Baltimore (Mr. Mc-
Kim) had been favored with a contract, when there
was not the remotest foundation for the calumny.
Another had charged that the members of ihe
House had purloined the money missed by the Ser-
jeant-at-Arms, and both those writers were admitted
to seats on the floor, and to mingle with the mem-
bers As to the present subject, Mr. B was op-
posed to bringing the "Spy" to the bar, and was
opposed to the whole investigation, because he
would not condemn a member of that House upon
such testimony
Afiersome further remarks from Messrs JENI-
FER, FILLMORE, REED, and McKAY, at the
suggestion of the latter gentleman,
Mr WISE modified his proposition, by restrict-
ing the investigation to members of the House, and
by bringing Mr. Davis to give the name at the bar
Mr DROMGOOLE withdrew his amendment.
Mr. RIVES moved to insert after the words
" mernbar implicated," "it a member of this
House "
Mr PATTON moved an adjournment   lost
After some remarks by Messrs BOON and
TURNEY, Mr RIVCS'S amendment was agreed
to.
Mr UNDERWOOD then gave notice, that if
this icsolution should he rejected, he would move the
original one
Mr THOMAS then moved an adjournment lost
—ayes 72, noes 91
Mr UNDERWOOD then moved to mseit the
original resolution as a substitute
Mi  WISE prefened the original himself
Mr CUSIIMAN then demanded the previous
quest on, being on the substitute agreed to a¡¡
above, which was not seconded by the House—

Mr. CRARY moved an adjournment- lost 76

Mr WISE moved to strike out the words " if a
member of this House "
Mr UNDERWOOD accepted of this as a mo-
dification, on the understanding that a motion
would then be made to insert it
Mr HAYNES then moved to mseit the words
"if a member of this House "
Mr THOMAS called for the yeas and nays on
this question   which were onlered
After a fe v remarks by Messrs MERCER,

tlem n, and without taking the question,
The House adjourned at quarter past sit o'clock,
