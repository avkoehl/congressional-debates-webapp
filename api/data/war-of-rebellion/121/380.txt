He was seen by ne of our returned officers at Pittsburg on his way. Lieutenant Lumpkin was unable to ascertain the cause of this proceeding. It is said to have been done in pursuance of special orders from Washington. I will thank you for any information upon this subject. Will you not cause Lieutenant Lumpkin to be delivered to us?

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN E. MULFORD, Assistant Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I again bring to your attention the case of the Honorable J. B. Heiskell. He is in close confinement in the penitentiary at Nashville, Tenn. It appears that he is held under the charge of treason against the United States. As we have released all political prisoners, I ask that he be discharged without any further delay. If it be the purpose of your authorities to keep him in prison, I will thank you to inform me why it is dne and what it is that so distinguishes him as to make him an exception in the rule you are applying to other political prisoners.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,
