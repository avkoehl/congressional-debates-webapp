The enemy came out and attacked Warren between 10 and 11 a. m., but were repulsed with great ease. No loss reported on our side except General Culter, slightly wounded, and Colonel Dushane, killed. General Warren reports 400 prisoners captured that he knows of; there may be more. I am expecting a heavy attack this afternoon, and preparing for it.

Everything quiet to-day. There were indications all day of the enemy collecting his strength to attempt to drive our forces from the railroad. The effort may be made to-morrow. I suspended about 2 a. m. to-day the order for an attack which had been prepared and was to have been made at daylight. Yesterday's operations cost the enemy very dearly in killed, wounded, and captured, whilst our loss was very small.

Our position on the weldon railroad now seems entirely secure. One division of infantry and the cavalry have been working worth, destroying the road as they go. They met some opposition to-day from the enemy's cavalry and were consequently further re-enforced. Prisoners taken since the last repulse of the enemy repeat the report of W. H. F. Lee being mortally wounded, General Clingman losing a leg, and General Sanders killed. These reports, however, may not be reliable.

CITY POINT, VA., August 24, 1864.

Yesterday evening the enemy engaged our cavalry which was protecting the party destroying railroad near Reams' Station. General Gregg was about one mile and a half west from the station and maintained his position, the fight lasting from 4.30 p. m. till 9 p. m. He reports his loss at 75. Earlier in the afternoon colonel Spear, commanding brigade of Kautz's cavalry, had a sharp engagement with the enemy's cavalry on the Vaughan road near Reams' Station, and, nortwith-standing largely superior forces against him, maintained his ground, inflicting heavy loss on the enemy. He reports over 180 of the enemy's dead left upon the field. The road is now thoroughly destroyed to
