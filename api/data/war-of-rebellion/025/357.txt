There is said to be in Jackson a cotton-buyer from Cincinnati by the name of Handy, who at home is known as a secessionist. He is reported to have made overtures by which he would smuggle through our lines quinine. Arrest him.

HDQRS. THIRTEENTH A. C., DEPT. OF THE TENN.,La Grange, Tenn., November 23, 1862.

Brigadier General I. F. QUINBY:

General Brayman telegraphs that a man from Somerville, who knows Jackson, says that he is there with cavalry, three pieces of artillery, and several hundred infantry, waiting for re-enforcements from farther west of there and preparing to come in this direction. They probably intend to break both roads. Have you or can you obtain any information of the truth of same?

By order of Major General U. S. Grant:

JNO. A. RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MOSCOW, November 23, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

I was informed just at dark that there was to-day a large rebel cavalry force at Hay's Bridge, about 6 miles west of this place. These, in connection with the report just received that Colonel Lee had already been sent toward Somerville, led me to believe that the rebel force has got south of the Wolf River. They could have been intercepted by sending out a force to guard Hay's Bridge. I will send out all of my disposable cavalry early to-morrow, hoping to catch them.

I. F. QUINBY,

Brigadier-General.
