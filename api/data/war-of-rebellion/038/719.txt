RICHMOND, April 7, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Reports received here lead to the belief that Rosecrans will be largely re-enforced. Under existing circumstances, what number of troops, if any, can you send, for temporary service, to Tullahoma, with due regard to the safety of your positions?

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

JACKSON, April 7, 1863.

President JEFFERSON DAVIS:

Telegram just received. On 3rd April, learning large number empty boats were being sent down from Memphis, I telegraphed General Johnston, Suggesting it might be to re-enforce Rosecrans. I still think this possible. Latest official reports represent enemy as probably leaving Tallahatchee; also that he is landing in large force at Greenville, moving down Deer Creek by land, and endeavoring to get through Hushpuckanaw into Sunflower River. It is said, in Memphis, Grant will also attack Vicksburg, in front, in a few days. Attempt on Port Hudson is abandoned for the present. I am moving a brigade from there farther north, but do not think it safe, under existing circum-stances, to diminish force in this department.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 7, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston, Tullahoma:

Enemy certainly leaving Tallahatchee. Negro captured from them says all the fleet is going to Helena. Hartford, Albatross, and Switzerland 4 miles above Port Hudson. Probably try passage to-night.

Captain I. N. BROWN, C. S. NAVY, Yazoo City:

Letter of 31st just received. Will direct General Loring and Stevenson to turn over cotton-boats to your command. They should operate below Yazoo City.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 7, 1863.

Major-General LORING, Fort Pemberton, via Grenada:

There is reason to believe it is intended to attack Vicksburg in front. You must send a strong brigade to Stevenson at once. Turn over cotton-clad boats to Captain Brown, of navy. They must not be used as transports for troops. Assist him all you can. Shall telegraph to Yazoo City to send up boats for a brigade, including field artillery; also General Maury.

Major-General STEVENSON, Vicksburg:

The following just received from General Chalmers:

PANOLA, MISS., April 7, 1863.

I have received news from two sources from Memphis that Grand is about to attack Vicksburg in front, and that he will pretend to retreat. One says a spy has been
