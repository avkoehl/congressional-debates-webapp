that the country destined fbr the residence of
this people shall be fore\er "secured and guar-
antied to them " A. country west of Missouri
s.i d Arkansas has been assigned to them, into
wnch the w h te setikments ire not to be pushed.
No political communities can be formed in that
extensive n gion, except those w hich are estab-
lished bv the Indians th mselies, or by the
United States for them, find with their concur-
rence \ birnrr has thus been raised for their
protection agntnst the encroachments of our citi-
zens, nrd gn mi ng tht Indians, as t u as possible,
from tliosi tuls wInch hive brought them to
their present condition- summary authority has
been given, by Inw, to destroy all ardent spirits
found in their country, without waiting the
doubtful result and slow process of a legal seiz-
ure I consider the absolute and unconditional
mterd etion oi'this árpele among these people as
the firs' anil grctt stt p m their melioration. Half-
way m"isur<s will answer no purpose These
cannot successfully contend against the cupidity
of the seller and the overpowering appetite of
the buyer And the destructive effects of the
traffic are marked in every page of the history
of onr Indian inn rcourse.
Some general legislation seems necessary for
the regulation of the relations which will exist in
this mw state of things between the Go* eminent
and people of th  United States and these trans-
planted Indian tribes, and for the establishment
among the latter, and with their own consent,
of some principles of intercommunication which
their iiixtaposition will call for; that moral may
be subst>tu ed for physical force, the authority
of a few ind simple laws for the tomahawk, and
that an end may be put to those bloody wars
whose proseemion seems to have made part of
their social system.
After the further details of this arrangement
are completed, with n Tery general supervision
over them, they ought to be left to the progress
of events These,I indulge the hope, will secure
their prosperity and improvement, and a large
portion of the moral debt we owe them will then
be paid.
The report from the Secretary of the Navy,
showing the condition of that branch of the pub-
lic service, is recommended to your special at-
tention     It anpears from it, that our naval force
at present in commission, with all the activity
which can be given to it, is inadequate to the pro-
tection of our rapidly increasing commerce    This
consideration, and the more general one which
regards this arm of the national defense as our
best security against foreign aggression, strongly
urge the continuance of the measures which pro-
mote its gradual enlargement, and a speedy ¡n- '
crease of the force which has been heretofore em-
ployed abroad and at home     You will perceive,
from the estimates which appear in the report of
the Secretary of the Navy, that the expenditures
necessary to this increase of its force, though
of considerable amount, are  small compared to
the benefits w Inch they will secure to the coun-
try;
As a means of strengthening this national arm,
I also recomnrif nd to your particular attention the
propriety of the suggestions which attracted the
consideration of Congress at its last session, re-
specting the enlistment of boys at a suitable age
in the sen ice In this manner a nursery of skill-
ful and able-bodied seaman can be established,
which will be of the greatest importance Next
to the capacity to put afloat and arm the requisite
number of ships, is the possession of the means
to man them < fliciently, and nothing seems better
calculated to aid this object than the measure pro-
posed. Ar an auxiliary to the advantages de-
rived from our extensive commercial marine, it
would furnish us with a resource ample enough
for all the exigencies which can be anticipated.
Considering the state of our resources, it cannot
be doubted that whatever provision the liberality
and wisdom of Congress may now adopt, with
a view to the perf< ct organization of this branch
of our service, will meet the approbation of all
classes of our citizens
By the report of the Postmaster General, it ap-
pears that the revenue of that Department during
che year ending on the 30th any of June last, cx-
ieeded its accruing responsibilities, $236,206,and
that the surplus of the piesent fiscal year is esti-
mated at $476,327 It turther appears that the
debt of the D< pnrtment on the 1st div of July
hist, including the amount due to contractors
for th< qiuuter then just expired, was about
$1,064 381, exceeding the available means about
$23.700. and that on the 1st instant about $397,077
of this debt had been paid, $400.0')! out of post-
ages ace ruin? before hih , and $187,086 out of
postages ace ruing since In these pa\ merits are
included $67.000 of the old di ht due, to banks
After making thest pivments, the Department
had $7 i,0(H) in bank on the 1st instant The
pleasing assurance is given, that the Department
is entirely free from embarrassment, and that by
collection of outstanding balances, and using the
current surplus, the remaining portion of the
bank debt, and most of the other debt, will prob-
ably be paid m April next, leading thereafter a
heavy amount tobe applied in extending the mail
facilities of the country Reserving a consider-
able sum for the improvement of existing mail
routes, it is stated that the Department will be
able to sustain, with perfect convenience, an an-
nual charge, of $300,000, for the support of new
routes, to commence as soon as they con be estab-
lished and put into operation
The measures adopted b\ the Postmaster Gen-
eral to bring the means of the Department into
action, and to effect a speedy extinguishment of
its debt, as well as to produce an efficient admin-
istration of its affairs, will be found detailed at
length in his able and luminous report \ided
by a reorganization on the principles suggested,
and such salutary provisions in the lawsVegulat-
mg its administrative duties, as the wisdom of
Congress may devise or approve, that important
Department will soon attain a degree of usefulness
proportioned to the inciease of our population
and the extension of our settlements
Particular attention is solicited to that portion
of the report of the Postmaster General which
relates to the carriage of the mails of the Uni-
ted States upon railroads constructed by private
corporations under the authority of the several
States.    The reliance which the General Gov-
ernment can place on those roads as a means of
carrying on Us operations, and the principles on
which the use of them is to be obtained, cannot
too soon be considered and settled     Already does
the spirit of monopoly begin to exhibit its natural
propensities, in attempts to exact from the public,
for services vv Inch it supposes cannot be obtained
on other terms, the most extravagant compensa- I
tion.    If these claims be persrsted in, the ques-
tion may arise, w hether a combination of citizens, I
acting under charters of incorporation from the h
States, can by a direct refusal, or the demand of
an exorbitant pnce, exclude the United States
from the use of the established channels of com-
munication between the different sections of the
country; and w hether the United States cannot,
without transcending their constitutional powers,
secure to the Post Office Department the use of
those roads by an act of Congiess which shall
provide within itsolf some equitable  mode for
adjusting the amount of compensation'   To obvi-
ate, if possible, the necessity of considering this
question, it is suggested whethent be not expedi-
ent to fix, by law, the amounts which shall be
offered to railroad companies for the conveyance
of the mails, graduated according to the average
weight, to lie ascertained and declared by the
Postmaster General     It is probable that a liberal  i
proposition of that sort would be accepted              i
In connection with these provisions in relation
to the Post Office Department, I must also invite
your attention to the painful excitement pro-
duced in the South by attempts to circulate |
through the mails inflammatory appeals addressed
to the passions of the slaves, m prints, and in
various sorts of publication?, calculated to stim-
ulate them to insurrection, and to produce all the
horrors of a servile war                                             I
There is doubtless no respectable portion of  I
our countrymen who can be so far misled as to  [
feel any other sentiment than that of indignant  I
regret at conduct so destructive of the harmony  I
and peace of the country, and so repugnant to
the principles of our national compact, and to the
dictates of humanity and religion     Our happi-
ness   and prosperity essentially depend upon
peace within our borders; and peace depend*
upon the maintenance, in good faith, of those
compromises of the Constitution upon whie.h the
Union is founded
It is foitunate for the country that the good
sense, the generous feeling, and the deep-rooted
attachment of the people of the non-slaveholding
States' to the Union, and to their fellow-citizens
of the same b'ood in the South, have given so
strong ard impressive a tone to the sentiments
entertained against the proceedings of the mis-
guided persons who have engiged in these un-
constitutional and w icked attempts, and especially
' against the emissaries from foreign parts who
hive dared to interfere in this matter, as to au-
thorize tht hope that these attempts will no longer
be persistí d in Rut if tht se expressions of the
public will shall not be sufficient to effect so de-
sirable a result, not a doubt can he entertained
that the non-sin velioldmg State->., so far fiom coun-
tenancing the slight! st mte rfeience with the con-
stitutional rights of the South, will be prompt to
exereise their authority in suppressing, so fir as
in them lies, whatever is calculated to produce
this evil
In leaving the care of other branches of this
interesting subject to the State authorities, to
whom they properly belong, it is ne\ertlieless
proper foi Congiess to take such me asures as will
prevent the Post Office Department, which was
desigm el to foster an amic ible inteicourse and
correspondence between all the members of the
Confedei.icy, from heme used asan instrument of
an opposite character The General Government,
to which the great bust is confided of preserving
inviolate the relations ere ited among the State s
bj the Constitution, is especially bound to avoid
in its own action anything thntnny disturb them
I would, therefore, call the special attention of
Congress to the subject, and íespectfullv suggest
the propriety of passing such a law ns will pro
lubit, under sevi re penaltu s, the circulation in
the southern States, through the mail, of incen-
diary publications inte nded to instigite the slaves
to insurrection
I fi It it to be my duty, in  the first message 
which I communicated to Congress, to uigc upon
its attention the proprn ty of amending that part
of the Constitution vv Inch provides for the election
of the Piesident and th<  Vice President of the
United States      The leading object which 1 had
in view was the adoption of some new provisions
which would secure to the people the performance
of this high duty without any intermediate agency.
In my annual communications since I have in-
forced the same views, from a sincere conviction
i that the best interests of the countiv would be
promoted by their adoption    If the subject werf
an ordinary one, I should have regarded the fail-
ure of Congress to act upon it as an indication
of their judgment that the disadvantages which
belong to the present system were not so grea*
as those which would result from any attainable
substitute that had been submitte d to their con-
sideration.   Recollecting, however, that proposi-
tions to introduce a ne w feature in oui funda-
mental laws cannot be too patiently examined,
and ought not to be received with favor until the
great body of the people are thoroughly imprcs' ed
with their necessity and value as a remedy for
evils, I feel that in renewing the recommendation
I have heretofore made on tins subject I am not
transcending the bounds of a just deference to the
sense of Congress, or to the disposition of the
people.     However much wc may differ in the.
choice of the measures which should guide the
administration of Government, there can be but
little doubt in the minds of those who are really
friendly to the republican features of our system,
that one of its most important securities consists
in the separation of the legislative and executive
powers, at the same time that each is held re-
sponsible to the great source of authority which
is acknowledged to be supreme in the will of the
people constitutionally expressed   My reflection
and experience satisfy me that the framers of the
Constitution, although they were anxious to mark
this feature as a settled and fixed principle in the
structure of the Government, did not adopt all
the precautions that wertf necessary to secure its
practical observance; and that we cannot be said to
have carried into complete effect their intentions
