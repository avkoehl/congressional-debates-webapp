tention, on the south side of the river has compelled me to hold this side at every hazard. If the enemy should assume the offensive, and I am assured by reliable persons that in view of my position such is his intention, my force present is altogether inadequate, consisting of only 15,000 men. I have to request you, therefore, to come forward with all the available force under your command. So important do I consider the occasion that I think it necessary to give this communication all the force of orders, and I send four boats, the Diana, Woodford, John Rain, and autocrat, to bring you up. In five or six days my force will probably be sufficient to relieve you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. C. BUELL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

The steamers will leave here at 12 o'clock to-night.

MARCH 1, 1862.

General McCLELLAN,

Commanding, &amp;c., Washington:

Yours of yesterday and to-day received. I have two division, say 18,000 men, with thirty-six pieces of artillery. McCook's division will cross to-morrow. Wood will close upon him I think by the day after. I have sent the troops back to Clarksville. Johnson will not stand at Murfreesborough; in fact is preparing to get out of the way. I hope to be able to crowd him a little. Their plan seems to be to get the rear of the Tennessee, and in positions ot concentrate either on Halleck or me. I will say more about this when my information is clearer, and until then I cannot well determine my movements. You are aware that, and until then I cannot well determinate my movements. You are aware that, for reasons given some time ago, Carter's is the only column moving toward East Tennessee. I have not heard of his being beyond Cumberland Ford.

D. C. BUELL,

Brigadier-General.
