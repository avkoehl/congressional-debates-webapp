The prisoners of war from Tennessee appeared to be trued and earnest in their desire to becomeloyal citizens, and the board does not hesitate to recommend that all those whose homes are within our lines should be allowed to take the oath of allegiance and return to their families. The prisoners from Kentucky are also recommended to be released on the same conditions, viz, oath and bond.

As the prisoners from Arkansas, Alabama and Missisisppi are comparatively few in number and as the temptation to cross our lines to reach their respective homes would be very great and might be productive of injury to themselves, if not to the Government interests, the board would respectively recommend that they be retained at least for the present.

The board has made every exertion to get this report off at the earliest moment in order that if its recommendations be approved the oath could be administered by the proper authority, and the transportation to Camp Douglas, Chicago, of such number as may be released rendered unnecessary. The balance could be readily transferred to Camp Douglas, thus freeing the guard now employed at Camp Butler.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
