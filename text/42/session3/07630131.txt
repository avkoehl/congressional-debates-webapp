LouisviUe, and Portland Canal—Mr. Dodds.
Ho. of Reps.
that a portion of the people of this country
thought a man infamous who did not believe
in the divine right of slavery. Members here
were almost ready to expel a man as infamous
and unworthy of a seat on this floor if he
opposed slavery. How long will it take, in
times of great passion or excitement, to get a
large dominant party in this House wrought
up to such a pitch that they may expel the
minority from this floor for not believing as the
majority does? In times of great religious
excitement men may be expelled because they
do not believe in the true church, if you adopt
the doctrine that this House holds the peroga-
tive of determining whom constituencies shall
send to Congress and whom they shall not, or
if we attempt to add to or take from the quali-
fications prescribed by the Constitution.
Ther6 is another fact in this case which I
would like to impress upon this House, and
that is the entire absence of any proof or pre-
tense that either Mr. Oakes Ames or Mr. James
Brooks failed either by their votes or other-
wise to do their duty as members of this
House. The record is open. Here is the
Globe; look at their votes.
Louisville anfl Portland Canal.
SPEECH OF HON. OZRO J. DODDS,
olf ohio,
In the House op Representatives,
February 22, 1873,
On the bill (Jt£. R. No. 3922) making appropriation
for the repair, preservation, and completion of cer-
tain public works on rivers and harbors, and for
other purposes.
Mr. DODDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to the
floor to ask the indulgence of the House
while I submit a few considerations which to
my mind seem should be conclusive in de-
termining our action upon tbe amendment
proposed to the bill by the gentleman from
Indiana, [Mr. Holman.] The Louisville and
Portland canal, to which that amendment
refers, is a work in which the commerce of the
constituency I have the honor to represent ou
this floor is largely interested. It is a work
which not only affects the commercial pros-
perity and material interests of my people, but
those of all the States bordering on the valleys
of the Ohio and the Mississippi as well. The
necessity of such a work to the inland commerce
of the great West to provide a safe transit around
that natural obstruction in the Ohio river, the
falls at Louisville, Kentucky, was early felt,
and accordingly a company was incorporated
by the Legislature of Kentucky, forty-eight
years ago, (in 1825,) authorizing and empower-
ing it to build this canal.
No public work in the country so affects the
internal commerce of the States west of the
Alleghanies and east of the Rocky mountains
as this; and the truth of this statement will at
once be apparent from the fact that the build-
ing, the enlargement, and the improvement
of this canal have occupied the attention of
Congress and employed the best engineering
skill of the country at various and frequent
periods since 1825. There is no public work
with which the Government has ever in any
way been connected the merits of which have
been more fully discussed by the press, more
thoroughly investigated, and concerningwhioh
the documentary information and statistics are
more complete, than this same Louisville and
Portland canal.
It is proper in this connction that 1 should
sketch in a few words, as briefly as I may, the
history of this great undertaking.
HISTORY OF THE WOEK.
The Legislature of the State of Kentucky,
as already stated, by an act dated January 12,
1825, chartered a corporation by the name of
the Louisville and Portland Canal Company,
authorizing it to construct a canal around the
falls of the Ohio river at Louisville, Kentucky,
providing that the capital should be $600,000
divided into shares of $100 each, and giving
the right to said company to levy tolls on
vessels passing through it. Subsequently,
in 1829, the capital stock was increased to
$700,000, and in December, 1831, the com-
pany becoming embarassed for means, was
authorized to extend its capital stock to an
amount sufficient to complete the canal and
pay the interest on its cost. By the acts of
Congress of May 13,1826, aud March 2, 1829,
the United States subscribed for a thousand
and thirteen hundred and thirty-five shares
respectively, and in December, 1831, acquired
five hundred and sixty-seven shares more, un-
der and by virtue of the provisions of an act
of the Legislature of Kentucky, as its portion
of interest and dividends derived from the col-
lections of tolls.
The canal was constructed and has ever
since been in successful and profitable opera-
tion, and the tolls collected under the limit
of the charter granted by the State of Ken-
tucky yielded so much larger revenue than was
necessary to keep it in repair, that by joint
legislation of the State of Kentucky and the
United States, and by the consent of the indi-
vidual stockholders, a plan was entered upon
to make the canal free to the uses of com-
merce except so far as was necessary to keep
it in repair. This plan was inaugurated in
February, 1842, by an act of the Legislature
of Kentucky, the provisions of which were
accepted by all the stockholders, including the
United States. Under the process of purchase
the individual stock was all acquired, and
in January, 1855, the company tendered the
same to the Government of the United States,
through the Secretary of the Treasury, on the
conditions of its amended charter. The Sec-
retary, there being no express legislation by
Congress authorizing its acceptance at that
time, requested the president and directors of
the company each to retain one share of stock
(for eligibility) and to manage it under the
charter until authority might by law be con-
ferred upon the Department to receive it.
During this period the commerce of the
Ohio had enjoyed a wonderful growth. Ac-
cordingly the Legislature of Kentucky, in De-
cember, 1857, again amended the charter of
the company, authorizing it to construct an ad-
ditional branch canal extending to a safer por-
tion of the river than the main canal, and of
sufficient capacityto pass the largest class ,of
steam vessels navigating the Ohio. It thus
appears that from 1842 to 1855 the net income
of the canal was devoted without objection to
the purchase of stock held by individual stock-
holders, and by this process the Government
of the United States became the owner of all
but five shares of the stock. The following
tables of statistics, for which I am indebted
to the report of Hon. W. D. Gallagher,
special agent of the Treasury Department,
dated September 30, 1867, show the financial
history of this work, the amounts paid by the
Government at various times for stock, and
the different amounts of stock and cash
received by the Government in shape of divi-
dends. And I desire in this connection to
tender my acknowledgment of the very valu-
able aid I have received in the investigation
of this subject from the able and exhaustive
report of Mr. Gallagher, above referred to,
and from those of the officers of the engineer
corps of the Army, which reflect great credit
upon their professional ability as well as their
zeal and industry in the discharge of duty:
