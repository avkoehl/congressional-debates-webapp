THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
877
Mr. FOSTER. I would ask the Senator from
NewYoik whether the bill, in his judgment, makes
any change in the existing law in regard to the sit-
ting in one district by ajudge of another district?
Mr. HARRIS. I suppose not.
Mr. FOSTER. It makes no change in the ex-
isting laws on that subject?
Mr. HARRIS. I am sure it does not.
Mr. FOSTER. I am not aware of any objec-
tion to the bill.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading. It was read the third time, and passed
Mr. HARRIS. The title should be amended
so as to read: " A bill in relation to district judges
of the United States."
The title was so amended.
CAVALRY ORGANIZATION.
Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts. 1 move to
take up the bill for the better organization of the
cavalry forces. We nearly finished it the other
day, and I think we can dispose of it in a few
minutes.
The motion was agreed to; and the considera-
tion of the bill (S. No. 153) for the better organ-
ization of the cavalry forces was resumed as in
Committee of the Whole.
Mr. WILSON, ofMassachusetts. I understand
an amendment is pending which was presented by
the Senator from Wisconsin, [Mr. Doolittle.]
I propose, after consultation with the War Office,
to move an amendment to reach the object intended
by the Senator from Wisconsin, and my amend-
ment will be in the form of an additional section:
Jiiul be if further enacted, That the officers and enlisted
men necessarily discharged from servico by tliis act sliaJl,
ill addition to the allowances granted by existing laws, re-
ceive each three months' extra pay.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I withdraw my amend-
ment, and will consent that this amendment of the
Military Committee shall be adopted, as it accom-
plishes all I desired.
Mr. GRIMES. I should like to know whether
the Senator from Massachusetts intends that his
amendment shall cover pay and allowances, com-
mutation for rations, quarters, forage, &c., or only
the pay proper ?
Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts. The pay.
Mr. GRIMES. Ifitineludes all the allowances,
it will amount, for a lieutenant, to about three hun-
dred and seventy-five dollars.
Mr. WILSON, ofMassachusetts. I understand
it to mean simply the pay without the allowances.
Mr. CLARK. It is better not to leave any
question about it.
Mr. GRIMES. Say " pay proper."
Mr. WILSON, ofMassachusetts. Very well;
let it be so modified.
The amendment as modified was agreed to.
Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts. I propose
to add, as an additional section:
Â«5 nd be it further enacted, That all officers of cavalry, who
have been, or may hereafter ho, appointed in the volunteer
forces in the service of the United States, shall be examined
by a boaid of" officers, to be appointed by the Secietary of
War, who shall be familiar with the tactics and organiza-
tion of the mounted or cavalry service of the United States
Army.
The object is simply, in making this consolida-
tion, that there shall be a board to pass upon the
officers, so that we may select the best officers
possible The provision is general in its terms,
and is supposed to be all that is necessary to be
done.
The amendment was agreed to.
The amendment of the Military Committee, as
amended, was agreed to, us follows, viz.: strike
out oil of the original bill after the enacting clause,
and in lieu thereof insert:
That the cavalry forces in the service of the United States
shall hereafter be organized as follows: each regiment of

The bill was reported to the Senate as amended,
and the amendment made as in Committee of the
Whole was concurred m.

ment the other day to this bill, which I should
like to have read and acted upon.

The Secretary read the amendment, which was
to insert at the end of the second section the fol-
lowing proviso:
Provided, That in reducing said regiments to the number
prescribed in this act, reference shall be had to the Federal
population of the States in which said regiments have been
raised, so as to give to each State its proportion as near as
may be.
Mr. MORRILL. Upon some consultation with
the chairman of the Committee on Military Af-
fairs, I am induced to withdraw the amendment.

reading, and was read the third time, and passed.
