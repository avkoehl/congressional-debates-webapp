with large force. He was informed by some of Boone's men and some women. I have sent engine back for the train there, with orders to bring the men back, with all bridge guards at the several bridges, to Edgefield Junction, and there to await orders. I think Morgan's intention is to send part of his force there to destroy bridges on Edgefield and Kentucky road, the main body to remain at Gallatin until the party returns. If it would not leave this place in too great peril I would like to take two regiments and part of Bush's battery and move on to Gallatin, with the expectation of encountering Morgan's force at Gallatin. Will this do? Answer.

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 16, 1862.

Colonel MILLER, Nashville:

Yes, go promptly. You must expect that an effort will be made to cut bridges in your rear. That will not be serious if you defeat the enemy. Fall back as soon as you have driven away the enemy and take position behind the bridges and observe the enemy. Two regiments from Murfreesborough will move to Nashville temporarily. Inform Sidell and have them posted.

Major MURRAY,

Commanding Third Kentucky Cavalry:

Send four companies to Reynolds' to escort a train to Fayetteville. At Fayetteville cavalry from Winchester will meet and relieve you. If it should not, however, you can continue on with train to Decherd. Answer.

General NEGLEY, Columbia:

Have the men of Kennett's cavalry, who went to Nashville for horses, come down; if so, where are they? What is your cavalry at now?

JAMES B. FRY.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 16, 1862.

General NEGLEY, Columbia:

You had better send Kennett's cavalry on to the regiment; it is wanted. Let it and the Third Kentucky come by Cornersville and try to break up that nest.

JAMES B. FRY.
