CITY POINT, April 28, 1865.

Bvt. Brigadier General J. C. KELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

It was understood between General Meigs, Rucker, and myself that all the unserviceable stock, such as captured animals, should be sent to the Washington depot for disposition. I have here some 3,000 unserviceable horses and mules awaiting transportation. I suppose some 500 animals with old wagons and harness could be sold at Petersburg or this place to farmers with good results, should the general see fit so to direct. I am told General Ord has ordered some to be sold in Richmond. The rule should be uniform and I should have charge of such matters under the general's orders.

CITY POINT, April 28, 1865.

Colonel R. N. BATCHELDER,

Chief Qmr. Army of the Potomac, Hdqrs. Major-General Meade:

I desire you will have forage and subsistence to a moderate extent accumulated at the Junction to ship to Danville for the Sixth and Cavalry Corps, as soon as the road are in working order, say be Monday next. There is a shed and track for the five-feet gauge at Burkeville. So soon as sufficient stores can be accumulated at the Junction the track back to this point will be made five-feet gauge again, and this point will be the depot for Danville and Lynchburg. Therefore put in depot as soon as possible sufficient to answer some days, and notify the superintendent of the railroad when you have sufficient. Please also communicate with Colonel Bradley. The road from Burkeville to Manchester is being repaired, and trains will be run over it by Wednesday next, but the main supplies will be forwarded direct from this depot.
