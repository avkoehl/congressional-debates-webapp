BATON ROUGE, December 29, 1864.

(Received 4.45 p. m.)

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL, DEPT. OF THE GULF:

I am informed by the navy officer commanding the gun-boat near this post that orders have just been received from Captain Cornwell, commanding this naval district, to stop all passing or ferrying between this post and the opposite shore, not respecting military passes unless they come from General Canby. I presume there is a misapprehension in the case, as I see no reason for naval commanders to regulate the action of military authorities. I can easily stop the passing of any boats whatever, if so desired. I respectfully ask for instructions.

G. L. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
