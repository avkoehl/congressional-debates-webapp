was at Price's headquarters last night left him at Tetesaw Plains, about twenty miles north of west from Marshall. The whole army was moving in a compact body, the trains in the center, wagons moving two abreast, about 250 in number; had a drove of about 1,000 cattle. He also reports that Clark's division crossed the Missouri, moving south, at Glasgow day before yesterday; that the enemy were censuring an officer for not capturing a steam-boat, as he stopped for dinner and did not get a battery in position in time and the boat passed. did not learn that any boat had been captured. All Price's command was armed. Learned that they have now more arms than ever.

I am, very truly, your obedient servant,
