General BUTLER:

I have only two 20-pounders and two 3-inch guns. The 20-pounders have been firing all the morning. The 3-inch guns were sent out two hours ago, but I have not heard from them yet. Will hurry them up.

Have been unable to obtain reply from Fort Clifton for two hours. There are but three guns in sight from here. There were six this a.m.

Do you wish firing continued at present?

Major-General.

JUNE 16, 1864-9.30 a.m.

General SMITH:

The enemy evacuated our front at daylight this morning. I am sending out a division to demonstrate on the railroad to cut off the track if possible. I have ordered the gun-boats to open on Fort Clifton, which is the firing you hear. Burnside is within five miles.

B. F. BUTLER.

NEAR PETERSBURG, VA., June 16, 1864-10.30 a.m.

Major General W. F. SMITH,

Commanding Eighteenth Army Corps:

Push the reconnaissance in your front with the view of ascertaining the best point and manner of advancing this evening at 6 p.m., if such an advance should be ordered. Make all preliminary preparations for such an advance, and at the same time hold all your forces not necessary for holding your present line ready to re-enforce the left, in case of an attack from that direction. In the absence of myself and General Meade, General Hancock, by virtue of seniority, will have the general command of all the troops now in position about Petersburg.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
