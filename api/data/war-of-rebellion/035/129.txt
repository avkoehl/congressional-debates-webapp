Brigadier-General DAVIS,

Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: Brigadier-General Granger's force is supporting and covering you. The object of your expedition is to relieve Steedman's front and cut up any inferior force of the enemy close by. The main purpose accomplished, your force and that of Brigadier-General Granger will return, in supporting distance, your advance (which will be posted about 2 miles north of Versailles, at the point where the Eagleville road turns to the right) commanding both Versailles and Eagleville roads. Granger's rear near Salem. All your movements should be prompt and vigorous. A squadron of cavalry will be sent you in the morning, with which you will keep up constant communication with these headquarters.

By command of Major-General McCook:

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Murfreesborough, March 10, 1863.

Major General GORDON GRANGER, Franklin:

The following, forwarded for your information, was received from General Steedman this morning, dated Triune, March 9, 1863:

The enemy who appeared in front of my command yesterday disappeared during last night in the direction of Spring Hill, where I have no doubt they have gone. Major Tracy, of the First East Tennessee Cavalry, crossed the Harpeth this a. m., land traced them in that direction some 5 miles beyond College Grove. He learned that the forces consisted of portions of portions of Wheeler's and Van Dorn's command, numbering some 6,000 or 7,000; that they came from the direction of Franklin, and I therefore judge they were the same that defeated Colonel Coburn.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

SPRING HILL, VIA FRANKLIN, March 10, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Your dispatch received. I reported to you on my arrival here everything I knew of importance. I shall always do so. Van Dorn's force has gone to Columbia, and I will either catch it or drive him over Duck River. I think he will make a stand at Rutherford Creek. It is storming furiously, so that our march is necessarily slow. I can't learn of any force in the direction of Raleigh or Chapel Hill.

G. GRANGER,

Major-General.

SPRING HILL, VIA FRANKLIN, March 10, 1863.

General ROSECRANS:

The road from here to Chapel Hill is very bad, particularly from Raleigh Hill on. There is no passable road from Raleigh Hill to Riggs', so there will be no way to get Sheridan back, except by Franklin, Brent-
