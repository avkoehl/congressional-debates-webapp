better criterion is us productive wdusti/ A man who acquires
property accumulates wealth, and when he has done this, he
can soon convert it into money The man who has but d hun
dred dollars, will find that at t>ix pei cent it would support him
with the necessaiíes of life for a month, but if he weie to ex
pend it in Government lands, it a dollar and a quarter an acie,
and apply his labor upon those lands, the pioduction would not
only support him and his family, but the^uiplus of hi^piodue
tions would enable him annually to mercase ht¡? wealth But
he must have either the capital m money or the capital crimed
by his credit, for, if then is neithei capital nor rredir m the
country, to allow him m establish himself, he must be for evei

question is, how will the people be enabled to pay off all their
debts, which amount to many thousand millions, with only
eighty millions of specie, if you foice by your policy bank pa
