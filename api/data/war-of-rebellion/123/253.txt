CHICAGO, July 26, 1862-8.45 a. m. (Received 10 a. m.)

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The Board of Trade have raised a bounty fund of $30,000, and have recruited a full battery of artillery and are rapidly filling up a regiment. I deem it of great importance that the battery be promptly accepted. Answer for great war meeting to be held to- day.

ISAAC N. ARNOLD,

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., July 26,1 862-3.30 p. m.

Honorable ISAAC N. ARNOLD,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., July 26, 1862-3.30 p. m.

Governor MORTON,

Indianapolis:

Governor Curtin's call for nine and twelve months" men was not authorized by the Department, and is sanctioned only from the necessity occasioned by his premature action, and efforts are being made to correct it in Pennsylvania, which, I think, will succeed.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

INDIANAPOLIS, IND., July 26, 1862.

Honorable P. H. WATSON:

I am painfully surprised by the spirit of your two dispatches received this morning. From the doubts and hesitation expressed by your inquires I should infer that the requisitions made in behalf of the State are regarded in the light of favors, to be strictly scrutinized, and granted, if at all, with hesitation. I cannot organize artillery companies without being able to assure them they will get guns, nor can they drill without guns.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor of Indiana.
