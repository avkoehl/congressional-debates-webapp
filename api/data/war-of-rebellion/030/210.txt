C. GODDARD,

Major and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS LEFT WING, December 20, 1862-7.15 p.m.

Colonel J. P. GARESCHE:

The following dispatch just received:
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH DIVISION, December 20.

LYNE STARLING,Assistant Adjutant-General:

The firing in the front was by the enemy. A force of cavalry approached our outposts, supported by four pieces of artillery. I have sent out sufficient force as re-enforcements. The other troops are in line of battle. I anticipate no trouble.

VAN CLEVE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Fifth Division.

T. L. CRITTENDEN.

GALLATIN, December 20, 1862.

Captain CHARLES R. THOMPSON:

I am rather inclined to think it is a blind. We learn to-day that some move is being made toward Kentucky. It may be, however, intended to make an attack on the road higher up than this point. We will have more information on the subject this evening or to-night. Will dispatch you as soon as scouts come in.

SPEED S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.

GALLATIN, December 20, 1862-midnight.

Lieutenant-Colonel GARESCHE:

General Reynolds with myself were taking of attacking them in the morning, but concluded it would not do to have Gallatin so much exposed. Our information is that they have infantry, cavalry, and artillery, but not certain information as to numbers. We could not make Hartsville at any rate by 7 o'clock. We have ordered scouts out in every direction. We have given notice to our commands to be ready for any emergency. We could go, and would certainly go, if our force at the town was large. It would, under existing circumstances, be dangerous to undertake it.

SPEED S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Nashville, December 20, 1862.

Brigadier-General GRANGER,

Bowling Green:

Though Morgan appears to have no force near Hartsville, he may have taken circuitous route. Look out sharp, therefore.

By order of Major-General Rosecrans:

J. P. GARESCHE,

Chief of Staff.
