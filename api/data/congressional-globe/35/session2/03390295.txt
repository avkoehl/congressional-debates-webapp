ties who would undertake their management and
repairs.
Mr. FBNTON. If the gentleman will permit
me 
Mr. NICHOLS. I will yield the floor to the
gentleman in a moment. Let me follow this out.
What followed, sir? When you granted us the
lands, acting under a false sense of values, under
a speculative idea of improvements in prospective,
the State enhanced the price of her lands; she in-
duced the General Government to do so too. Your
maximums and minimums drove out the actual
settler; and, sir, as a consequence, one of the fairest
and most fertile portions of my State remains
unimproved. It remained a wilderness, almost,
for years, while the advancing tide of population
from the East passed us by and built up empires
west of us. We are shorn of our natural life, our
natural prosperity, by these improvident grants
of land. Take }Tour bounty land system, and
what has it clone ? I have seen men who cared
very little about the grants to them, and who said
that it would take more than the land'was worth
to go and locate their warrants. Where did these
wanants go? Look to your new States and Ter-
ritories, and there you will see your banker, your
speculator, your moneyed men, who, having pro-
cured assignments of these warrants, have taken
up the fairest portion of the national domain with
thousands of these land warrants so assigned to ,
them, and who thus are interfering with the pros- j
penty and welfare of those communities. Make
your pension system as improvident as you have j
made your bounty land system, and you will in- 1
flict the deepest injury upon the country, and
those who come after us will not remember the :
legislation of Congress to bless it, but to curse it.
If your pensions are not gratuities, what are i
they? Some gentlemen have called them debts,
Are they debts ? It so, why wait their payment ;
until thousands of your debtors have paid the '
debt of nature, whom you cannot pay now, and
whose children and widows have for yeais dragged
out, as you say, a life of toil and penury ? if a .
debt, then the debt was due when tho service was
leudered and the men discharged. Why did you
not pay U thwi ?
Sir, in this history of this Government this is '
the iirst efToi t to quarter men upon the Treasury,
whose conditions are those of health, strength,
and prospenty. Some may be poor; but such as
ate poor from' the effects of services rendered, are
provided for by existing laws. If they are poor 1
j'rom other causes, and have received their pny
and boumv land, can you still give more5 The
people's money: Taking the substance of the
igass, r^xini^ the n:\tion, to bestow upon a class
gratuuiu", after you haw; first pa*d all due them
Oil their e<;ntia<"ts, and have also bestowed upon
them bounties? 2s o, sir; 1 sincerely trust in;
Heaven that this thing may stop with us; and |
that our independence may not be destroyed, and ;
oursuiKtance eaten out by such a system as this.

The following is a statement of the piobable ,
number of beneficiaries, and the amount of money
per annum involved m the bill of Air. Sa\aoh, as
ongiiially introduced. The table explains itself; ;
and it will be seen is founded upon the three ;
months' basis, as ongmally repotted: \
Tabu: D.—Sho-.m^ the force employed in the vat of 1810 j
(, one. for a period of three months' or ujiu-aids, and the \
an-rar.it of j'-etuio as involved '<</ theproasions oj the House ;

Monthly Annual
Amount. Ammint.

If to this be added the amount of
pension for Navy and manne

sixths of force calculated for in
table L  89,640 00 3,075,680
$923,108 2.3 $11,077,299
Or amount involved m granting pensions under the House
bill for military and naval service in war of 1812, §-11,077,299
pei annum.
To show how little reliance can be placed upon
these estimates, and how much the actual con-
dition of our people set mortality laws, and calcu-
lations founded upon them, at defiance, I append
: the results of previous estimates as verified by the
| actual experience of the Pension Office. The ex-
| tract is taken from the report of the Secretary of
