very strongly. Held this position until the 2nd of September, when we closed a long and severe, but brilliant, campaign by a triumphal entrance into the fallen city of Atlanta.

To officers and men I must accord the nighest praise. All did their work well and cheerfully. Subjoined is a list of casualties during the campaign.

Respectfully submitted.

Report of Colonel John T. Lockman, One hundred and nineteenth New York Infantry.

May 4, agreeable to orders, broke camp in Lookout Valley and marched about five miles and bivouacked near Chattanooga Creek at night-fall. May 5, regiment detailed as train guard. Marched about twelve miles and bivouacked at midnight. May 6, moved at 5 a. m. and marched about eight miles and bivouacked near Pea Vine Church. May 7, moved at 4.30 a. m. and marched fifteen miles; bivouacked in Dogwood Valley. May 8, pursuant to orders, we left camp at 11 a. m. and took the road leading to Dug Gap. My regiment was assigned the advance. The usual precautionary measures were taken, and when about one and a half miles distant from the gap, a strong line of skirmishers was sent out to the right of the road. As we approached the gap, some of my men engaged the rebel cavalry near Mr. Hall's house, and secured 1 horse, the enemy making good their escape through the thick undergrowth which lined both sides of the road. The brigade was formed in line of battle to the right of the junction of the roads which led to the Dug Gap road, and orders were sent me to deploy my whole regiment and skirmish as necessity required, and to cover the front of the brigade. I skirmished on a line parallel to the road leading to the gap, and in crossing Mill Creek the skirmish line inclined to the left, parallel with the road, and the brigade line to the right. As soon as I discovered the position of the two lines, I hastened to the brigade commander in person and report. The brigade commander directed me to push on, and, if possible, carry the gap with my line. I returned to make the disposition, and when the brigade moved forward I pushed with a small party up the road, and received the first fire of the enemy, which wounded the leading skirmisher.
