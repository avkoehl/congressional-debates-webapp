Major-General THOMAS:

The Second Tennessee picket the lower fords, and the mounted men of the Twelfth and Thirteenth U. S. Colored Infantry patrol above. The One hundredth have no effective mounted men, as they have no saddles; have directed them to get some without delay.

Major-General STEEDMAN:

Do you think you could throw your force of 5,000 men on Tuscumbia, Ala., and destroy the enemy's pontoon bridge, by using the Memphis and Charleston road to convey your troops rapidly to Decatur and moving light from there? By relaying the pontoon bridge you could take your troops and artillery across at Decatur.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
