SWARTWOUT'S DEFALCATION
REMARKS OF HON. J. L. MARTIN,
OF ALABAMA,
In the Hobse of Representatives,
February 7,1839,
On the Resolution providing for the appointment
of a Committee to inquire into the Defalcations
of Samuel Swartwout.
Mr MARTIN said he felt it to be his duty, as
his course would differ upon this question nom
that of most of those with whom he acted generally
upon this floor, to state his reasons foi the vote
which he was about to give He was in favor of
appointing the committee by the House, and he '
greatly preferred that it should be by the viva voce j
vote of the members, but, if that mode could not
be adopted, he would then go for the election by
ballot He was not induced to this course from
a want of the fullest confidence m the Presiding
Officer, very far from it He had full confidence
that by that officer the committee would be hon-
estly and fairly appointed, and that the investiga-
tion to be made by such committee would be as
thorough as that which would be made by a com-
mittee appointed by this House He had seen
nothing m the course of the Speaker to bring any-
thing like a doubt to his mind upon that subject—
certainly not in the appointment of committees of
a similar character heretofore, with which he had
been acquainted Other considerations influenced
his course than such as are confined to this House,
or any of as member* Party feelings weie high,
and party stnfes fierce, in almost eveiy part ot
the Union Crimination and reciimination is the
order of the day, not only upon this floor, but
elsewheie That, upon chaiges without proof,
he might not be disposed to íesort to this unu
sual mode of appointing a committee, although he
might be disposed to go tor the investigation asked
This case (he said) presented a different state of
things altogether We ai e not left to suspicion or
conjecture upon this subject nor to charges of gen-
tlemen heie We see that the treasure of the na
tion has been abstracted by one of its officers to
the laige amount of some million and a quarter of
dollars, that this process of abstraction his been
going on for the space of seven years and mire
The investigation here proposed must necessarily
involve the conduct, not only of the defaulting
officer himself, but other high functional íes of this
Government, whose duty it was to ascertain and
detect such abuses The question was thus len
dered one of grave importance, and one to which
the eyes of the country would be dnected He
felt, therefore, that it was due to the importance
of the subject that this House, on all sides of it,
should be satisfied with the investigation proposed
to be made,and that the country, too, should have
such a report fiom the investigators as would leave
not the shadow of a shade of doubt or si spicion
even of its correctness, or that the whole transac
tion was not fully disclosed and presented to them
Can this desirable result be fully attained by an
appointment by the Presiding Officer, especially
aftei the objections which have been made upon
this floor, in the apparently earnest protests of gen-
tlemen which ha\e gone forth > However coriect
the result might be upon such appointment, yet,
sir, doubt might be entertained,and clamor would
iertan I y be tailed aga nst it
If, then, (said Mi M ,) the committee was ap-
pointed by the votes of the representatn es of the
people, there will be no ground for objection or
doubt whatever    Gentlemen would be deprived
of the pretext for calling it a whitewashing commit
tee, allocked pack, together w«h various other ad
captandum hulgus epithets which are so liberally
used here, in regard to those which have been
heretofore constituted in the usual way
Mr M said, in the examination which he had
made into the subject of this defalcation, he must
confess he had been struck with astonishment at
the great length of time through which these ab-
stractions had continued, and at the very large
amount which had been purloined without detec-
tion It had impressed him with the fear that
there was something wrong, either in the admin-
istration of the Treasury Department, or in its
organization He could not bee how it was pos-
sible that a well-organized department, adminis-
tered with a proper vigilance, could be thus ím
posed upon He did not wish to be understood
as doubting the honesty and integrity of the head
of the Treasury Department, for he did not enter-
tain any such feeling, nor did he intend to utter a
suspicion of dishonesty as to any suboidmate of
his, but he could not say, however, that he did
not entertain doubt of the proper vigilance in those
whose duty it was to supervise the returns and
accounts of the collector
Mi M would not go into the examination of
how the failure to detect this fraud had happened,
or who was to blame for it, that would be the
legitimate business of the committee, and upon
full proof on both sides, as well in behalf of the
Goveinment as of that of the individuals impli-
cated, that committee will be able to give us a
much more correct result than we can possibly
come to here When the facts are reported to
this House, we shall find but little difficulty in
piovidmg a remedy hereafter in like cases He
said he was not foi shielding any man, nor did he
believe, or even suspect, that the Administration
party was All, he had no doubt, were for the
investigation of this outrage, and for the preven-
tion of its recurrence Por himself, he said, he
had always gone for investigation when honor-
able members upon this floor took the íesponsi-
bihty of making charges against any of the public
officers of the Government, that in such cases he
went upon the ground that, if the charges were
true, it was pioper that they should be brought to
light, and the delinquents punished, if untrue,
that the responsibility ot making the charge might
rest upon the individual making it This he
thought a safe lule of action, it certainly would
be, it, upon the coming m of the report, the sub-
ject could be so viewed and treated by this House
This, howevei, was not generally the case, and
certainly it was not in regaid to the committees of
1836-'37, of which the gentleman from Virginia
[Vlr Wise] had spoken some days ago The
lesulf, in each of those instances, had been that
the House had lost sight of the report of the com
mittee in the trial of the members of it, and upon
charges preferred by those who had been disap
pointed in their expectations in the investigation,
and, too, at whof^e instance the lrquiry had been
bet on toot by the appointment of the committee
and in that way they had succeeded in warding
off the weight of lesponsibihty which should have
been placed upon them by the House and the
country He said he went for irquiiy, and also
for a stuct responsibility from every quaiter upon
which lesponsibihty should properly rest, and he
said it was with a view as well to stuct investi-
gation and satisfaction to this House and the coun-
tiy, as to such responsibility, that he would give
his vote upon this question in favor of the ap-
pointment by the House of this committee
Mr M said he knew nothing, personally, of
the course of the committee of which the gentle-
man from Virginia [Mr Wise] was chairman
He had nothing to say for or against that com-
mittee Of the other committee, of which his
friend, also from Vngmia, [Mr Garland,] was
chairman, he had the misfortune to be a member
fne gentleman from Vnginia [Mr Wise] was
also a member of the same committee, and of course
knew all its proceedings That gentleman, he said,
a few days ago, when andressitio' the House upon
the question now undei consideration, referred to
tl is committee, and the one of wl ich he [Mr
Wise] was chairman, and to their proceedings, as
he has unon many occasions heretofore, in terms
certainly not very respectful to the committees,
and still less to the Speaker who appointed them
In this instance, doubtless, he intended a rap upon
the knuckles of the Speaker, but it is done
much over those of the committee He charges
them to have been a " stocked pack," " sex tres
committees " In these remarks, (Mr M said,)
he knew the gentleman alluded to the political di-
visions of the members upon those committees,
and with no intention of personal disrespect, and
in the same sense the remarks heretofore were
made by that gen tleman, as he had no doubt, and
certainly they were, so far as he (Mr M ) was
individually concerned, for that gentleman had
so stated upon the floor, with regard to himself
In referring to the proceedings had by those com-
mittees, the gentleman remarks " Every throw of
the dice was still sea; tres," &c
Mr M said he was sorry the gentleman had
not made the distinction between the committees,
which he must have known existed jn their course
of action, if he has properly characterized those of
the committee of which the gentleman himself was
chairman, for he cannot but know that the journal
of the committee of which the gentleman from Vir-
ginia [Mr Garland] was chairman, will not bear
him out in the charge that " every throw of the dice
was sex tres " That gentleman well knows that
every question proposed to be put by himself, or a
gentleman from Tennessee, [Mr Petton,] (who,
with himself, managed the whole examination,) to
any of the witnesses called before us, if within
the reasonable construction of the resolution under
which we acted, not to say a strained construe
tion of it, was voted for by the chairman of that
committee and himself, (Mr M ,) which of
course gave the majority in its favor And he
defied a solitary instance to the contrary to be pro-
duced from that journal He said the rule which
he adopted for his own government, when he went
upon that committee, was, to err on the side of
inquiry, if he erred at all, and that, in looking
over the journal of that committee, as he had done
recently, if he found anything to regret in the part
which he bore upon that committee, it was found
in permitting improper questions to be put to wit-
nesses, by the aid of his vote, none, certainly, on
the otnei side He said, under this btatement of
facts, which the journal of the committee would
show, he would appeal to any gentleman to say if
that committee was obnoxious to the charges made
by that gentleman
Mr M said, if further proof could be neces-
sary or desired by any gentleman, he knew he
could safely refer to his friend from Virginia,
[Mr Garland,] who was then present, to sustain
him in everything he had said upon this subject,
that that gentleman and himself generally voted
together upon the various questions submitted for
the decision of that committee, and in many of
the instances in which he and his friend [Mr
Garland] felt it their duty to oppose the proposi-
tions of the gentleman from Virginia, [Mr Wise,]
and those submitted by Mr Pfvtoj., they weie
accompanied in their votes by the gentleman from
Louisiana, [Mr Johnson,] who was, according
to the gentleman's own showing, one of the
"tres " He submitted it to that gentleman to say
whether he was acting fairly in his remarks, by
thus including in his denunciations this committee
Was it fair to do such gross injustice, even for the
purpose of effecting other objects' If he wished
to rap the Speaker over the knuckles, was 1* fair
to do so at the expense of those against whom
he had no ground of charge? He said he asked
nothing of that gentleman byway of favor, he de-
manded justice only, and that he expected to have
accorded to him He said he trusted he had heard
for the last time those sweeping denunciations of
that gentleman against all investigating committees
appointed by the Speaker, and that, if any de-
served such denunciations, the gentleman would
hereafter make the proper distinction He said
he was desirous not to be misunderstood in the
remarks which he had made, that as he had not
spoken of the course of the other four members
upon the committee whose conduct he had justi-
fied, it might be supposed that he thought then
conduct reprehensible He did not so intend to
be understood, for he held no sucn opinion In
the review of the journal which he had taken, he
