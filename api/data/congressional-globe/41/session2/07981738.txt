spirit meters.
Mr. ALLISON. I ask the unanimous con-
sent of the House to offer the following pre-
amble and resolution:
Whereas the use of a mechanical devico known as
a spirit meter has been generally, and is yet by many
officers of internal revenue, including the Commis-
sioner thereof, regarded as a necessary adjunct to the
work of the ganger for correctly determining the
quantity of spirit passing within a given time from
tne worm of a still to the cisterns of a distillery; and
whereas after careful and prolonged investigation
by a commission appointed under a joint resolution
of Congress, approved February 3,1868, and tho prac-
tical trial of a large number of such devices, one was
finally adopted by the late Commissioner under the
authority conferred in section two of the act of July
20, 1868. " imposing taxes on distilled spirits and
tobacco, and for other purposes;" and whereas un-
favorable reports as to the mechanical construction
of this instrument, as to the metal in part of which
it was constructed, and also as to its working quali-
ties in practical use at a distillery, are stated to have
so multiplied upon the hands of the present Commis-
sioner several months ago as to induco him to sus-
pend its attachment at distilleries, andalso to modify
the regulations concerning thesupply and use of the
same, so far us for the time being to prevent the
man ufaeturer from realizing on certificates of deposit
now standing in the hands of collectors of inter-
nal revenue, payable to the order of I. P. Tioe, for
meters delivered i and whereas for the purposeof ob-
taining reliable information as to the correctness of
those reports, and of ascertaining the practical value
of the meter in the light of experience, the Com-
missioner appointed a committee to make the neces-
sary investigations and experiments in one of the
largest spirit-produciDg collection districts in the
United States, (as stated in his annual report for the
past year;) and whereas it is understood that this
committee has completed its work and made report,
and also that the clerk of the Commissioner's office,
under whose general direction the test experiments
were conducted, has reported specifically as to tho
results of the investigation : Now, therefore,
He it retolved, &c.. That the Commissioner of In-
; ternal Revenue bo respectfullyrequcsted tocommu-
j nicate to this House at as early a period as may be
practicableâ€”
1. The rules and regulations concerning spirit
meters adopted by his predecessor and in force at
the time the present Commissioner assumed theduties
of the office.
i 2. The objections which were found to exist in the
supply and use of the meter adopted under such
regulations.
3. The steps taken by him to investigate the valid-
ity of such objections and to ascertain tho bestmeans
of correcting them where correction Iras deemed
necessary.
4. The results of such investigations made by tho
office, and tho conclusions arrived at by the Com-
missioner.
5. Tho alterations made by him in the regulations
governing the delivery, attachment, and uso of the
meter, together with any alterations concerning the
same points now in contemplation by him.
6. The opinion of the Commissioner in regard to
the utility of any meter for measuring spirits while
in process of production; and what legislation, if
any, is in his opinion needed in order to secure to
the Government, the greatost advantages that may
probably be derived from the use of a meter, as
a means of preventing fraud upon the revenue in
the production of spirits and the collection of tax
thereon; and also in how far, and with what prob-
able advantages, the same or a similar auxiliary may
be applied to use in the production of malt liquors,
and tne collection of the tax thereon.
