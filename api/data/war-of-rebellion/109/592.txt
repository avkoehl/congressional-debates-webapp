Brigadier-General GARRARD:

An orderly of General Kimball reports seeing two companies of rebel cavalry just east of Wright's house, and not far from the match factory. Have you any scouts or vedettes in that quarter? It is rather bad to have those fellows penetrated so far to our rear behind our flank. They may be the advance banner of a bigger force.
