GENERAL MEADE'S HEADQUARTERS,

April 2, 1865-6.45 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Humphreys' attack was suspended last night, but as soon as I heard of our success on the right I ordered him to push out and to do all he could. I presume his skirmishers are engaged by this time.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

GRANT'S HEADQUARTERS,

April 2, 1865-6.45 a.m.

General MEADE:

Wright can put in everything he has except the garrison of inclosed works. Ord is pushing by the shortest road to help Wright. I heard from Sheridan at 12.30 this a.m. He intended to start at daybreak and sweep the White Oak road and all north of it down to Petersburg.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 2, 1865-6.55 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I presume that the west way for Ord to assist Wright will be for him to make a vigorous attack on his front if there is any hope of his carrying them.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 2, 1865-6.57 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Parke reports the capture of 2 redans, 2 forts, and 12 guns, opposite Fort Sedgwick, but the enemy have a line in the rear.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.

APRIL 2, 1865-7.10 a.m.

Major-General MEADE:

There is more necessity for care on the part of Parke than either of the others of our corps commanders. As I understand it, he is attacking the main line of works around Petersburg, whilst the others are only attacking an outer line, which the enemy might give up without giving up Petersburg. Parke should either advance rapidly or cover his men and hold all the gets.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
