MARTINSBURG, July 19, 1864.

General HUNTER:

The reason General Kelley did not receive your telegram until this morning is, the wires were grounded between this and Cherry Run somewhere, and did not work until 9 a. m.

BROOKE,

Assistant Operator.

MARTINSBURG, July 19, 1864.

General KELLEY:

The road east of here to Harper's Ferry is entirely unprotected, and the track men will be afraid to go east of the Opequon to-morrow without protection. Can't your order the iron-clads, now with Captain Petrie, to be sent to Captain Shaw, and let Captain Petrie get those you intended for Captain Shaw? It is important to have some protection for the workmen, as Opequon will be finished by 1 a. m., and progress will be stopped without the necessary protection is furnished.

J. P. WILLARD.

CUMBERLAND, July 19, 1864-9 p. m.

Captain PETRIE,

Hancock:

You will proceed to Martinsburg with your iron-clads, and protect the workmen repairing road and telegraph line between there and Harper's Ferry. Consult with Perry Willard, railroad agent, on your arrival at Martinsburg. Report to me often and fully.

B. F. KELLEY

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, July 19, 1864.

Colonel STEVENSON,

Greenland Gap

(Care Colonel Hoy, New Creek):

Your report received. Keep your scouts constantly active and well out in your front; be thoroughly and correctly advised of McNeill's movements. The enemy is now retreating from Maryland, and a portion of the force may enter South Branch Valley. If parties are sending off cattle and bacon to the rebels arrest them at once. Keep out small infantry scouts in the mountains constantly. What is your latest information of McNeill?

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
