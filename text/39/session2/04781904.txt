tora-house and post office at Quincy. I have
not been furnished with any facts in regard to
it; and 1 am not in a condition to move the
Amendment if I had the facts at this time.- I
wished merely to call the attention of the Senate
to this policy. If we are to inaugurate it again,
of course each State will take steps to have
public buildings erected in its important cities
for the accommodation of the custom-house
and post office. I am not certain but that is
the best policy. That I suppose could be
determined by ascertaining what amount the
Government pays in rent. If it is cheaper to
put up a building and own it than to rent accom-
modations in these large places it is probably
good policy to erect a building at once. The
post office accommodations cost the Govern-
ment a very considerable amount I know in my
own State; I cannot state the precise amount,
but as much as ยง1.000 rent is paid in some
places, and probably considerably more in
others. What is paid for custom-house accom-
modations I do not know. I imagine that the
amount of customs collected at these places is
small, unless it is at a time when railroads are
being built in the vicinity, and then considerable
amount of iron have been entered and the duties
has been paid on it. Quite a considerable sum
has been collected in that way; but in an ordi-
nary year I suppose the amount of customs col-
lected at Quincy would be small. I do not know
what it is.
Mr. FESSENDEN. If the Senator gets a
recommendation from the Department, of |
course it will be done in his place as readily as
another.
Jlr. TRUMBULL. I imagine that it would ;
but it is a question of general policy whether it
should be adopted. โข ,
Mr. WILLIAMS. I presume the Sena- 1
tor from Illinois is not familiar with the his- j
tory of this subject, or he would not interpose :
any objection to the amendment. Astoria is
located at the mouth of the Columbia river,
and is the port of entry for the collection dis-
trict of Oregon, and there has been a custom-
house there for a great many years.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Is the building owned
by the Government?
Mr. WILLIAMS. No, sir; the building is
an old frame building, in which the records of
the United States are kept, and are exposed to
destruction at any time by fire.
Mr. CRESWELL. What amount of duties
is collected there ?
Sir. WILLIAMS. A very large amount of
duties, and it is constantly increasing. I do
not know the exact amount. This subject has
been investigated by the Treasury Department,
and a plan and specifications have been pre-
pared bv the chief architect. I have here the
letter of the Secretary of the Treasury recom-
mending the construction of this custom-house
for the sake of safety, so that the Treasury and
the records of the United States can be pre-
served, and it is certainly nsnal to have one
custom-house in a collection district. This
custom-house will collect duties for the whole
State of Oregon. There is a very large foreign
commerce now between the towns on the Co-
lumbia river and British America and other
foreign ports; and that business is rapidly in-
creasing, and the revenues are rapidly becom-
ing important, and in the judgment of the
Treasury Department it is necessary that there
should be a fire-proof building there, so that the
treasury and the records will be safe. In 1852
$40,000 were appropriated for the erection of a
custom-house at Astoria, and yet the money was
suffered to go back to the Treasury without
being expended, for some reason or other.
1 here is no doubt of the necessity of such a
bnilding there.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. WILSON. I move to amend the bill by
adding at the end of the first section the fol-
lowing clause:
To enable the Commissioner of Agriculture to erect
a Department of Agriculture on reservation No. 2 in
the city of Washington, according to the plan pro-
posed by him, to foe constructed under the general
provisions of lnw relating to the construotion of pub-
J lie buildings, ^100,000.
! Mr. TRUMBULL. As that amendment will
probably take some little time, I desire, with
the indulgence of the Senator from Massachu-
setts to submit at this point a report from a
committee of conference.
Mr. WILSON. Very well.
payments to loyal persons.
Mr. TRUMBULL, from the committee of
conference on the disagreeing votes of the two
Houses on the joint resolution of the House
(H. R. No. '222) prohibiting payments by any
officer of the Government to any person not
known to have been opposed to the rebellion
and in favor of its suppression, submitted the
following report:
The committee of conference on the disagreeing
votes of the joint resolution of the House (H. R. No.
222) prohibiting payments by any officer of the Gov-
ernment to any person not known to have been op-
Eosed to the rebellion and in favor of its suppression,
aving met. after full and free conference have agreed
to recommend, and do recommend, to their respective
Houses as follows;
That the Senate recede from its first amendment,
disagreed to by the House, and agree to the bill as
passed by this House with the-Senate's other amend-
ment. LYMAN TRUMBULL,
GEORGE G. FOGG,
J. W. NESMITH,
Manager* on the part uf the Senate.
C. DELANO.
JOHN B. ALLEY,
A. THORNTON,
Managers on the part of the House.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I am inquired of by a
Senator behind me the effect of this report.
Really I do not think it changes the joint reso-
lution at all. The Senate struck out the words
which forbade payment, not only to a person
who had aided the rebellion, but also to any
person who was not known to be in favor of
its suppression, and inserted in lieu of those
words other words on the motion of the Sen-
ator from Wisconsin, [Mr. Howe.] The other
words inserted in lieu of them were that no
payment should be made to a person who
should not prove to the proper accounting offi-
cers that he was opposed to the rebellion. I
think the two expressions amount to about the
same thing, and the committee agreed to abide
by the resolution as it was before those words
were stricken out.
The report was concurred in.
civil appropriation bill.
The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole,
resumed the consideration of the bill (H. R.
No. 1173) making appropriations for sundry
civil expenses of the Government for the year
ending June 30, 1868, and for other purposes,
the pending question being on the amendment
of Mr. Wilson, to appropriate $100,000 for
the erection of a building for the Department
of Agriculture.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I should like to have
some explanation of this matter.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will explain what I
know about this proposition. Under the act
creating the Department of Agriculture cer-
tain rooms were assigned to it in the building
of the Department of the Interior. Ever since
that time there has been a constant struggle by
the Department of the Interior to get the
Department of Agriculture removed to other
buildings beyond its limits, on the ground that
all the room in that building was needed for
the Department of the Interior. Every Sec-
retary of the Interior for the last four years,
and I believe there have been three of them in
that time, has, in official communications ad-
dressed to Congress, and also in letters to the
Committee on Agriculture, asked that some
arrangement of this kind be made. About
three years ago Congress by law authorized the
Commissioner of Agriculture to hire a build-
ing outside of the Department of the Interior
for the accommodation of some of the officers
of his Department. Rooms were hired, and
the duties of some of the branches of the
Agricultural Department wdfc discharged out-
side of the Department of the Interior. By the
terms of that law the arrangement continued
but for three years, and the term expires on
the 1st of July next. The Commissioner of
Agriculture has been for years beseeching Con-
gress to provide some suitable building i'or the
Department of Agriculture, and so has the
Secretary of the Interior. The Committee on
Agriculture have been considering the matter
very thoroughly for three years. The trouble
was, first, to get a site ; and second, to agree
upon a plan, so as to get a style of build-
ing that would be suitable for the purpose.
Finally we have agreed upon the ground ; we
have agreed upon the form of the building, not
a very expensive one, and on the whole have
concluded to recommend that provision be
now made for the erection of this building.
The plan contemplated is on your table, and
may be readily seen. It contemplates the
erection of a comparatively plain brick struc-
ture about one hundred and fifty feet long and
some sixty feet wide, upon a very neat plan,
that will look very well.
It was first proposed to erect this building
on Judiciary square ; but the Secretary of the
Interior was very much opposed to that, be-
cause he said that that ground was reserved
for a Department building for the Department
of the Interior, to be erected at some future
time, and he objected to the use of that ground
for this purpose. It was then proposed to put
it upon reservation No. 2, which lies to the
west of Smithsonian Institute, where the Uni-
ted States have some twenty or thirty acres of
ground now in possession of the Agricultural
Department. It is proposed to erect this
building in that place; and after a careful ex-
amination of the plan proposed and the site
selected we thought it was better to erect the
building now as a matter of economy. The
architect .has prepared the plan and estimates,
I think correctly, that the building can be
constructed for $100,000.
We now pay for rent of buildings for the
use of the Department of Agriculture $3,500
a year, besides occupying a considerable por-
tion of the basement or Jower story of the
j Department of the Interior ; and the Depart-
j ment of the Interior in the mean time for want
of room have been compelled to hire a house
; outside for some of their officers. The result
J is that we are now paying in rent nearly the
j interest on the money it will cost to erect a
suitable building for the Department of Agri-
culture.
I will state also that the collections which
Congress have authorized the Commissioner to
buy, and the collections of agricultural pro-
ductions which are constantly increasing, have
become so great tli&t the Agricultural Depart-
ment want additional room for them. The
plan of the new building appropriates a very
handsome room for the exhibition of agricul-
tural products. On the whole, the Commit-
tee on Agriculture thought it wise to pro-
pose this measure, and I can state to the Senate
that it has been very fully considered, and has
not been reported without a careful examina-
tion, perhaps more than is usually given to
most propositions of this kind, and it is sanc-
tioned by the Secretary of the Interior, the
Commissioner of Agriculture, and I believe by
every one who has had anything to do with it.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I do not know that it
will be of any.scrvice for me to say a word
about this proposition ; and I do not know but
that it is all right. That depends upon what
Congress intends to do. I wish, however, to
call the attention of the Senate for a moment
to the progress of things. In the first place,
if I had the book before me, I should like to
call their attention to a debate that took place
in this body when the Department of Agricul-
ture was established, which was only about
four or five years ago. Before that time we
had been in the habit of expending about
seventy thousand dollars a year for agricul-
tural purposes, and that had grown up by de-
grees from the first appropriation of $1,000,
which was very strongly opposed on the ground
that this Government was not instituted for
the purpose of having departments of agricul-
