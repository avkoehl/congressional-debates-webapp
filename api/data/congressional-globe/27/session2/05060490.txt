The question nowbefore the House waa, whether they would
ay for the Jahoi and work done in completing a banding
which fiad been delivered to them, and which was now in their
possession Thw appropriation wasnotforfurnttuie, but for
completing the building itself He understood—and if he waa
misinformed, he wibhed any one to correct him—that $22 000
Out oí $25,000 was for work actually done on the build ng
itself The remaining 96,000 might he a matter of scruple with
some gentlemen—$22,000, beyond all controversy, was foi
Work* done under contract He trusted (hat the difficulty as to
the disputed item of $6,000 or $7,000 would be íemedied by the
amendment which had been introduced by his colleague, [Mr
RoósBVfiX/r,] proposing tbats the bill should be audited by the
accounting officers of the Treasury Department be<methey
were paid If this amendment were adopted, whenever an
objection was rai&ed as to the price of any of the articles, the
account wonl 'be audited before it was allowed
Mr "F brieil) adverted to the arrangement made for the eiec
turn of the custom house under the direction of superintendents,
the manner of their peiformance, the contracts, &c stating that
theviron work for which they were now called toappropnate
vr&t lei out to contract at the lowest raie
He made an earnest appeal to the House to sepaiate the
question of appropriation for the furniture from that now ask
ed for paying the w >rkmen of this buifaing He a^ked the
members oí the committee whether they would take the prop
erty ofthese individuals, which they n w had m use, without
appropriating for payment foi ifí Admitting that the Secreta

Mr. EVERETT said the gentleman from North Carolina
£Mr ¡Saunders] had called the attention of the committee to
tn&tp&rtoi the lepurtof Mr Pomiextei that relates tu the fur
Dishing the custom house, in whii h a point of veracity is made
ag&iUbHhecollecioi,(Mr Curtí  ) He wibiied to letieve the
collector from that charge What was the issue made by (he
commissioner'* In another letter (says the repor pose 162)
fromMt* Curtis to Mr Ewing, under date April 15, 1841, he
eays "If you will gire me authority, I will proceed to fur
msh the building, puisumg the plan ptopised by Mr Fr^zee,
the arch tert to the late Secret ny,andwhicktbas approcedby
him " The accuuev of the part unders oied is questioned by
the commissioner On the same pige he says ' It also ap
pears by the ex'iact of the latci of Mr Woodbury, given
above, that he did not approve the r_ Ian of Mi Iiazee in ex
tenso, foi furnishing the buildine as Mi Curtid has ¡stated, but
¡Imitó hiittFeif si npfy to the pían foi the inft-r'oi arrangement
oí the building, so fki as regards the an moment of the dy
doors, furniture, and painting of the non woik "
Mi £ thought the com missio ler was not boine out even by
theextiact underscored and as quoted by him Did Mr Wood-
bury intend only to approve tne aiiangcmcnttá the folding
doors, theanang-emeNiofthefurnifuii., and the arrangement
of the pamimgoi ti e iron work? Without the tmpha*>is ofiho
itahcismg no such construction could have hepn imagined
But all doubt will be lemoved by the en'iie letter ol Mi Wood
bury, correctly quoted    It is as follows
Treasury Department, March 3 1S41
Sir The department h-mrg called upon the naval ífo ci
and surveyor at New \oik to lepoit the-rjo it vews in regard
to the dUferenct: of opinion existing between yoiuseli and Mr
Hoyt, connected with the newcustom house building, they have
accordingly complied with my request
In. accordance with their lecommendations, I deem it proper
to authorize Mr John frazee to be continued in the office of
superintendent and architect of the building until the custom
house and tkc furnishing of thp teapecttve rooms shall ha%c
been co?npleted And it is dean able that Mi Fr<fzee's pians
for the interior arrangement oi the building should be cat ned into
effect—so fax* especially, as legirda the com,iructi<m and ai
rangemeut of the fly doors, furniture, and the painting of the
iron work
I am-j veiy respectfully, youi obedient servant,
LEVI WOODBURY,

Walter Bowne, E^q
Comrmseuwei oi the New York custom house, N. Y
The question at issue was, did Mr Woodbury approxe Mr
Frazee'a plan for furnishing the custom house as stated by Mr
Curtis? In his opinion, the affh mative was too obvious for ar-
gument Ho did not entei into the question whether Mr
Woodbury had autbouzed the expenditure of the money for
which the apprormnon wasa^'cH
Mr ROOoLVELf obtamed thefloot, and, observing that he
thought the comm'ttet ai er the debate that had taken place,
wert able to vote u derptandm^h saul he would abstain from
anyremaiks tí thev would suiter tie vote row to betaken
If, however, the gentleman fiom índinu-CUr Phot-fit J insisted
on addressing the commute*, hesiuuld claim tupneted
ÍCuesof'qu btion qie«tion '1
Mi  PROFS' IT sign fied hi^ intention to speak
Mr ROOSEVELT pr cee. ed    He could no believe'hatthe
committee seriously intetidr 1 to deny this apptopnatn p    He
thought it pr>per that crifici-m should be mdu'jvd hue m de-
bate, in legaid to thepuohc officer , but when they came to vote
he co ild not in d;nne that any gentleman could go against this
proposition     Authority  hid  been  sriven—whaher right oi
wrong he would not say   for the completion of the build ng
The cuntnet made by be commissi) ers \Mfh the b ack mith
fof which he hat' in bib land the original) rrovided that ho
whole iron work required f >r tht budding sh mid be furnished
by the biack&mith e-nplo vt.1 un< n w*> con i c Toe wrk
had been legadv conti acted for a id npder that contract it had
bepn doné, and thev wete now a ked rot whbtnci the^ won d
pay so much oi not but wne he they would pay *ui it at all
as the amendment offered by h ra provided that the accounts
«hou'd be audited
H« arjpealed to the committee whether while the custom
house was pointed out to strangers as a wurk of magn ficence
a&Apnde  they would leave h in thepower of the wotkmen en
itf^«ay that the iron which ihey had been authorized to furnish
wi tt had not been paid for.
He was satisfied that gentlemen were willing to pay a fair
compenc!ation for the labor and mateimls expended, and refer-
red tn an amendment which he would offer (and wbich is no-
ticed hereafter,) more effectually to guard agaust an improper
orextiavagant expenditure of this appropriation
Mr CAVE JOHNSON refeired to the former refusal of
Congress to make an appropriation for iuimture for the cus-
tom house
Mr ROOSEVELT reminded the gentleman that the churman
of the Committee of Way«i and Means had stated that this item
embraced no furniture at all
Mt JOHlSSONsaKh after this appropriation had been re-
jected by Congress and by the Vcretaiy of the Treasury, the
device had been resorted to, to fasten the de&its and benches to
tbe building, and thus to smuggle the appropriation for them
through Conerees, under the name of completing the building
Thp new collector had not come to Coiigre*s for thisfurm
ture, but bad applied to the Secretary of the Treasuiy, and
said that all this furniture was to be made under the old con
tract                                                                       **
The building had been considered complete, but when it was
found that neither Congress nor the Secietary of *he Treasury
(Mr Woodbmy) would furnish the furr uure they vveie told it
was not fimshf d, and the furniture was taken and annexed to
the building
Gentlemen had attempted to prove that Mr Woodbury sane
tioned the furnishms the custom house His letter approved
fheplan It did not authorize an expendituie   iUhecontiary,
it exnres-Jv said that tbey wou d have to wait for an apptopri
avion by Congress
In relinon to he amendment of the gentleman from New
Yoik, [Mi íioosFVf-i/f] pioviding that the Audi'n should
au lit the--e accounts, he bai he would adjust his own accounts
before anybody else, and that he considered a sufficient ans% er
for that
He hoped that the House, instead of making an appropm
tien, and authouzmg an officer to audit the accounts, would
reject it If they sanctioned this mode of pioiteding on the
pait of (he contractors of the Government, there was an end of
the powers ol this House lie would not voie for the appro
pnation, (he was understood to say,) unless the suh)ect cdttie
befoie them m me shape of an application for a claim from
tho->e who did the work
Mr J yielded to explanations from Messrs WOOD and
PROrFll
Mr PROrriT next obtained the floor, and ad1 es ed the
committee at some knstth m opposition 10 the a mm Imert s v
mg way,in the couise of hi^ remark , for \ mpo eg of exrla
nation, to Missis FILLMORE, EVERETT, McKEON, and
ROOSEVELT
The^quesiion was then taken on the amendment of Mr,
Roosr\ clt an 1 it was agieed to
Mr HOOSE'V 11T moved to amend the amendment of the
Senate at thus amended by striking out the words "suns now
due," and insertitg, in lieu thereof, the «oids 'S-uch amounts
as may be justly due " and ¡¡so, by invertiré befoie the words
' twtnty eight thousand two bundled dolíais," tne words "not
excftding "
W hich amendment was agreed to
And the quts'ion recurring on the amendment of the Senate,
asthu« amei dtd—
Mr MERIWETHER moved to amend the ameVment, by
s,nkmgout^tó200 and inserting, in lieu thereof, £25 300, mas
much as part of the sum claimed was not yet due, and a part
of it was f u Lontwsencies He thought we hsd ^pent enough,
id all conscience on this Cus'om ho i^°, u I - a cost the Govern
menttwo millions anoaquaiter, he was now wilting to «quare
accounts, and he done with it After this appropriation, he
never would vo e another dollar, if ho lived to Le as old as Mu
thuselah
After some remaiks from Mr McKEON, the amendment
was rejected
The question then lecurrmg on the Senate s amendment as
amended—
Mr BOWNE demanded teller^, which being ordered, they
reponed the vote to stand   ayes 61, noes 66.
too the Senate's amendment was rejected
The next pmendment reponed from the Senate was "for tne
lemovaf of tí e statue of Washington undei the direction of a
joint committee of both Hm sea of Congress, the account for
which shal 1 be audited and certified by said committee, a sum
not exceeding $1 000 "
Mr KE1M moved to amend this by on app* opnation of ©3,500
for the constiuction of a suitable pedestal to the statue, to be
approved by the Presii ent and heads oí depaitments
Mr CALHOUN madi, some remarks totally inaudible to the
reporter
Mr KEIM referred to a letter from the Secretary of the JNavy
in explanaron oí the propriety of the provision proposed He
said that, were the question n w whether we would order this
statue oi not, he should be among the first to vote in the nega
tive, but Congress had now sptnt about $40 000 upon it; it was
here, and to leave it standing on a structure of yellow pine posts
and boards would be a reflection on the character of the nation
He was for making an appropriation for the commencement
oí aduiable pede&cal of stone, the finishing of which was to
be under thedntction of the President and the heads of de
partments
Mr niXMORE inquired whether Mi Keim was a member
of the committee who had been appointed to superintend tne
removí! of ¡¡¡estatué?
Mr KCIM said he was not, he had offered the resolution on
his right as a member of the House to propose ?n amendment
to any In 1! efn e it
Mr FILLMORE <-aid nc bal mquired merely to know whe

Mi FILLMORE mquned of the Chair whether the amend-
ment was suillciently congruous to the mattei of the bill to be
m order?
The CHAIR ruled it to be m order
Mr FILLMORE said he had received information (though
from what source he could not now recollect) that there was
some understanding between the commute? on'he statue and]
Mi Gremough, that he, beimr the auiboi t f thenatue, should
have the direction of the forman^coneUiirtu n of the pedestal.
Mr PENDLETON was air ember of ihe committee on the
removal of the stati e from iff i< impr place to t at it now oc-
cupies He was happy to be able, to inform the honorable mem-
hei from Peí nsylvaria[Mr KEi>1l¡haii was i tended thatthe
present wooden pede-n<J of thest tue was not to be permanent.
It was a mere temporary erec nm to suf port the statue nil the
prtpei pedestal should be constructed and substituted in ita
place Various objections had existed to the former position of
the statue in the centre of the i otundo, and it was agreed by all
that its location must bo changed The committee had made
various expenments, both as to rela'ive position and to eleva-
tion, and they hadfinalJy*agreed on the spot where the statu 
now stands as beit-ig the mostsuitable It was the spot indicat-
ed m the letter oT Mt Grecnongh himself, as that ftom which
u would be seen to most tdvatrti°e The committee could have
no undemanding with Mr Gteenou^h as to the construction
of the pedestal, as they had received no powei on that subject;
but trey were unanimously of opinion that it would be but
justice to him, as the sculptor of the statue, that he should be
allowed to complete (he w hole design He believed some cor-
respondence had been had by the chairm m of the joint com-
mittee with Mr Gieenough on the surjecf, but of this he waa
not sine He could notimaame how the gentleman from Penn-
sylvama could for a moment '^nasme u to he the intention of
aii)bo ly that thá pieoci t wooden b-upportof the oiatue should
standasi s permanent pede-tal on which strange supposition ho
hadgiounded a somewhat tart criticism tn the committee

Mi KEIM said he couid not consei t to withdraw his amend-
ment, he had rather it should h?, voted down Though very
imperfectly hear ', he wis und r&tood to say that the resolution
in regaidtothe e.'atue made no dcMímatun of a sculptor to
complete the pedes al As to the relative merit of the sculptor
who had t-xecuted the si at tie, that was a motter he should be
the last (o canvas- That the s'atue pt ssessed veiy hish merit,
all, he believed, were aereed—corntes or semi comtes, strict
cons luctionists or latitudinarmns, Whigs or Democrats, but
he tho isht wt, had not taken that care of t which it deserved
He was for carrying out what hadbeen beeun, in such a manner
that we might looii on the wh de work with puieind pleasure.
The House had ^pent^on-e two da\s in discussing the cost of
thefurmtme of a custom housp,aid many days and largesuma
onwoiksof foruficanon This wis a moral fortification, and
one of ihe most powerful description; itwasa national altar,
before which all patriotic 1 earts mu^t be rea 3y to sacrifice
every narrow and party feel ns lie hoped the amendment
would be adopted, and then Mr Greenouah would no doubt be
allow" 1 a fair chance uf competition with others m furnishing
the design
Mr ADAMS s>aid he shoulJ have been disposed to vote for tha
amendment, but for the cloeu 2 íen ai k just made bv the gentle-
man from Pennsylvania If Mr A had anv knowledge of the
just and norjrjble leelings of an aitist like Gteenough, he
would prefer an oidei should be passed by the House to with-
diaw the entire compenscuun already n ade him for his labor
on the st uje, to having a companion set. up between himself
and some atner artist for the furn sbmg of the pedestal on
which it was to stand Could he enter am such a proposition
with ind fference, Mr A should not feel wi'Im? to vote him as
many nous for his work as Congress nad paid him thousands.
Mi A had heard a lumorj months a^o that there was some plan
on foot for employing another aitis on the pedestal And he
dd peisonally kn^w that the «en-at on produced by it among
tne friends of Mr Greenough was tuch (a^d he fully partici-
pated m it) thai he be'ieved t! ey would prefer to see the
statue ¡share the fate wbicn hud fai on upon another statue of
the same man by an aitist of eoja'iy transcendent talents, [he
was understooduiallude to Canova s, which was burredm the
(apito'at Raleigh,! toiiavms; him exposed to an indignity so
moitifyiníí as the calling m of another to finish what he had
begun Mr A had no intention of derogatmi from the merits
of any ar'ist who might be m the view of the mover of thi 
amendment, or of other gentlemen, but he hoped Mr Green-
ough would be allowed to complete his own work, and that
for this further labor he would be properly compensated
Mr C J INGERSOLL made some inquiries of Mr Pbndi^
ton, nota word of which reached the reporter
Mr PENDLETON reminded Mr Inoersoll that he had
never attended the meetings of the committee, though a. mem-
ber of it, or he would have known that they had no power of
contract! g with Mr Greenouih or any other sculptor they
were empowered merely to have the statue placed in a proper
spot m the rotundo
Mr INGER^OLL rejoined, butsfiM m the same faint voice.
Mr PENDLETON said, if any private arrar^ement had been
already made then there was no need of adopting this amend
mejit Mr Gieenough had made some suggestions as to the
proper mode of const rue- ting t'ie pedestal for his statue, and Mr.
P thought he ousmt to be allowed to manage that matter in his
own way
Mi JOSEPH R. 1NGERSOIL observed that theie seemed
to be some miscoomp un en the subject of the amendment.
When the statue arrived uom Italy Congress had not been in
se&sion, and th< Secreta y of the Nivy considered himself
bound os it hid been fiotigat in a public ship, to take charge
and ci btodv of if v I Congress should determine what should
