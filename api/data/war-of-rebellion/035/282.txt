Brigadier General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General, Washington:

This army has been so scattered that it has been impossible until recently to procure accurate reports. I reply to your telegram of 25th as fully as possible:

Received from Department of Ohio, since November 1 [1862], 8,212

horses, 11,197 mules; 9,119 unserviceable horses and 1,159 mules have been returned to Louisville to be recruited. Issued to Army of Cumberland since November 1, 10,305 horses and 7,492 mules. Reports for March 31 show in the army and at depots 3,939 artillery horses, 11,478 cavalry horses, including those used by mounted infantry; 2,942 draught horses and 805 extra, and 23,859 mules. At least one-fourth of the horses now in use are own out and unfit for service. Mules have been substituted for a large part of the draught horses reported above.

Quartermaster.

Colonel MORTON,

Commanding Second Brigade:

In pursuance of Special Field Orders, Numbers 17, the order of march to-morrow will be as follows; First, Fuller's brigade, and train; second, Second Brigade; third, Third Brigade, and, fourth, General Sweeny's command.

The troops will be in readiness to march at 5 a.m,. but will await the order for so doing.

All teams now with their respective brigades, except ambulances, will move in front of brigades. Ambulances in the rear of brigades to which they belong.

Brigade commanders are hereby notified, in obedience to instructions from the general commanding, that at daylight to-morrow morning a movement will be made on the enemy in front, if he is found to be in force; the passage of the creek will be made in force, otherwise the movement will result in throwing a strong cavalry force over to destroy corn-cribs, bridges, &amp;c., as far as possible, after which the troops will take up the line of march in return. All inquiries of the inhabitants will be answered with the idea that the column is falling back on Tuscumbia for re-enforcements, and great pains taken to impress them with that idea, the object being to mislead them as to our intentions. Keep them employed with watching this column, in order to give time to Colonel Streight's command to reach the mountains. Brigade com
