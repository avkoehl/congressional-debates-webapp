WILLIAM P. SMITH,

Mater of Transportation, Camden Station:

SIR: I thank you for your kind attention, and preservance in aiding us,and hope to-morrow will crown your efforts with the success that will lift the horses out of Bealeton. This p.m. a demand is made for 350 men and 10 officers there. Please add 8 box cars to the stock train for these men and their baggage. In the loading I had no control, and Colonel McCallum, who attended to it, has come in. The officer in charge has to-day promised me to put 15 horses into each car. Last night the conductor had as much as he could do to get 10 horses loaded per can. The officers stood out to put 4 horses only in, and bed them.
