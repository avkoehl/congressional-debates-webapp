THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Jan. 17,
.and other petty, miserable offices, which, though
less in dignity and character, now yielded better
pay.
Again: fix the compensation at $2,500 per an-
num, instead of making it depend upon the length
of the session, and you would secure short ses-
sions, and thus save infinitely more than any sum
of,additional expense which the proposition might
ipvolfe in some cases. He knew this was not the
most popular proposition, but 
Here the hammer fell, and the explanation was
ternoinated.
The CHAIRMAN announced the question on
the amendment to the amendment.
Mr. SCHENCK said he supposed it was not in
order to fill the blank now.
The CflAIRMAN replied that it appeared to
him it should be filled now.
Mr. SCHENCK said that would require an
amendment in the third degree, which was not in
order. Let the amendment to the amendment- be
voted upon, and if the committee adopted the
principle, it would then be for them to vote for
filling fhe blank.
The question was then taken on Mr. Schf.mck's
amendment to the amendment, and it was rejected.
Mr. LORD moved the following, as an amend-
ment to the amendment:
That mileage of the members of Congress shalbbe paid
at the rate of eipjit dollars tor every twt my miles, for' the
first hundred mites; Un the next *Mii-ecciiing one hundred
miles, at thu Mtuoi f=even doliam fen evfry twenty miles;
for the next s-ucceedit.'i one hundied milt's, at the )ate of
six dollars for eveiy tu entv miles; lor the next succeeding
One humhed imhss, at the rat'1 of five dollar.-(or every twenty
miles for the ne.\t succeeding one hundied miles, at the
rate of four dollars foi every twentv miles. and all remain-
ing riiittunce* at the rate of throe dntl.ir.s fur ever} twintj
lrul^s—dis-tance of the icsidencp of nmnih.'rs bi pisj; <v!cu-
lated bv the route over tvliich the mail* «irc usaulh, eonvc, u<|,
from the places oi [lieir lesidenee to the seatol the iXational
Government: Provided, tu-ccrt'iclcn, T.iat no inembfii o! the
Senate or JIou- e of Repie^enhitive^ fiom any State, or Del-
egate from any Terri'orv, '"hall receive tor mileage more
than two thousand dollais, during any one nessiou of Con-
gress.
Mr. MORSE inquired of the Chair whether the
amendment was amendable?
The CHAIRMAN answered in the negative. i
The question was then taken on the amendment
of Mr. Lord, and was decided in the negative.
So the amendment to the amendment was re-
jected.
Mr. MORSE inquired if it would now be in or-
der Cor him to move to amend the amendment?
The CHAIRMAN having answered affirm-
atively—
Mr. MORSE said he would move to amend the
amendment !>y inserting one dollar additwncd on
every twenty mile^ane! the fim-liundicd. (That
is to say, reveisinn- tj,e proposition of Mr. Loup.) !
Mr. M. explained. Me said that n'any (lis-
crimination was to be made, cithei for or a<^aiust ''
persons residing af different distances, those fur-
thest ofi'were most entitled to that disciiminjlion. I
Ho was compelled to leave home one month before !
the meetim; of Confess, to insure his presence I
here when votes wete to he i;iven on important ^
subjects. And he was one month after the ad- ■
iournment of Congress before he could reach his !
home; whilst a Iaro-e portion of the membeis le- i
sided within twenty-four hours' travel, could come
nerc in one day befoie Congress met, and be at.
home the day atier Congress adjourned; and when ;i
necessarily absent, they could make the journey
in the same space of time. " '
Moreover, it was in the power of a lar^e pro-
poition of the members of Congress to communi-
cate with their families and friends by telegraph,
and to attend quietly to the business of the House, '
undisturbed by considerations affecting ihe health '
and welfare of thcKe whom they had left at home.
It was, therefoie, but fair, if additional mdea-e :
was allowed, tli.it those who resided at the greatest
distance from the capital should be em:tied*to that
additional miien^e. Therefore, lie submitted his
amendment. He had not offered it for the mere
purpose of clap trap, tic would vote for it. it
was fair, and it was the only practicable way of
equalizing the mileage of members. And it was
the only fair proposition, next to that which had
been introduced by the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr.
ochenck,] which was, to allow an annual salary. '
booking to the extension of our territory, by ne-
Im'e nf"' d Wal'' by ,rfca(y' ol' by purchase, the
W Ifwi W,T occuPied ne! -iy the whole
year, and they should be paid accordingly. And
he would, at the proper time, move to fill the blank
with five thcyas&nd dollars.
[This last annunciation was received with great
good humor-]
The CHAIRMAN now asked the gentleman
from Louisiana [Mr. Morse] to reduce his amend-
ment to writing.
[Mr. M. did so. We could not procure a copy
of it; but, being the pending question, we will give
it in the next publication.]
Mr. MURPHY now desired to ask the gentle-
man from Louisiana [Mr. Morse] what was the
actual expense of traveling from New Orleans to
this city ?
Mr. MORSE.' About one hundred dollars.
What is the expense of traveling from New York
to this place ?
Mr. MURPHY. Ten dollars.
Mr. MORSE. Plow much is your mileage?
Mr. MURPPIY. Ninety dollars; ten times the
actual amount. How much is yours?
Mr. MORSE. Mine is two thousand dollars,
and it costs me one hundred. [Laughter.]
The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman from
Louisiana insist on his amendment?
Mr. MORSE. Certainly, sir. (And he pro-
ceded to write it.)
Pending which question, the committee,on mo-
tion of Mr. Dickinson, rose and reported progress.
Mr. ROBINSON, from the Committee on En-
rolled Bills, made a report.
And the House adjourned.
