[Indorsement.]

Respectfully submitted to the Secretary of War.

JNO WITHERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

DEFENSES OF BALTIMORE,

Fort McHenry, Md., July 22, 1863.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS, Adjutant-General U. S. Army:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inform you that in consequence of the want of accommodations a large portion of the prisoners of war received at this post are while here entirely without shelter. Upon many of the sick and wounded these exposures operate with great severity. I would respectfully recommend, therefore, the erection of cheap buildings or sheds of capacity to accommodate 1,000 persons, together with suitable hospital accommodations.

I am, general, with great respect, your obedient servant,

W. W. MORRIS,

Brevet Brigadier-General, Commanding.

NEW YORK, July 22, 1863.

Colonel WILLIAM HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners:

COLONEL: Yours of the 19th instant is received. I have no roll of any prisoners not recorded by you except the one of those brought by the Cahawba. This will be sent to you on my return to Fort Monroe. The Secretary of War mentioned to me about sending the wounded rebels to City Point to be taken care of by their own friends. Please ascertain if he so desires and inform me by telegraph. In such case you can have the use of the steamer New York. I leave for West Point to-morrow.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.

NEW YORK, July 22, 1863.

Colonel WILLIAM HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners:

COLONEL: Can you inform me how stand the cases of Captain Baylor, Captain Compton, Major Armies (or Ormesby), Lieutenant Davis, Captain William F. Gordon, and Captain Camp, all said to be confined at Fort McHenry and reported to the Confederates as harshly treated? This of course is not so, and I would like to receive from you a statement of their true condition, status, and treatment. Can you give me any information about James W. Foster, of Mosby's command, captured seven or eight weeks ago in the town of Middleburg, Va.? Also of Lee A. Dunn, one of the King William Home guard, captured a short time ago in the vicinity of Nelson's Bridge? Where is Colonel Andrew Talcott (arrested in New York), now confined, and what are the charges against him? Can you also give me any information of Major C. B. Owsley, said to have been tried at Bowling Green, Ky., as a spy? Please give me replies to the above inquiries at your earliest convenience.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.
