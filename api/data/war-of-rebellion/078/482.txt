NASHVILLE, September 26, 1864.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

The civil and criminal courts are in operation in Davidson, Montgomery, Rutherford, Bedford, Murray, and at many other places in the State. We are going to organize the courts as fast as practicable through the State, but in many instances it is unsafe for judges and jurors to attend and hold courts. Nearly all the cases in this region of the State which have come under the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the State might be turned over. We are progressing as rapidly as possible in the rear of the military to restore civil authority. The raids which have been made in this section of the country have a great tendency to keep a rebellious spirit alive. A hope we shall have good news from Richmond soon.

ANDREW JohnSON,

Military Governor of Tennessee.
