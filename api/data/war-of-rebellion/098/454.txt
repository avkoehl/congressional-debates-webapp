Inclosed you will find a list of casualties by name. * I also forward herewith the official reports of the several regiments.

In conclusion, I would state that Lieutenant-Colonel Briant, Eighty-eighth Indiana Infantry, and Lieutenant Colonel M. H. Fitch, Twenty-First Wisconsin Infantry, are deserving of mention. They have acted as wing commanders during the campaign; and I am much indebted to their energy, care, and bravery, both on the march and on the battle-field, for the remarkable preservation of the brigade. My staff, Captain J. W. Ford, acting assistant adjutant-general; Captain Sherock, inspector, and Lieutenant Whittaker, aide-de-camp, are also well deserving of mention. Their prompt and valuable assistance and gallant conduct during the perilous campaign deserves my highest acknowledgments. Captain Van Valkenburg, assistant quartermaster, and Captain Stuart, acting commissary of sustenance, also deserve to be mentioned for the able and energetic manner they have managed their respective departments.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. C. HOBART,

Brevet Brigadier-General, Commanding.
