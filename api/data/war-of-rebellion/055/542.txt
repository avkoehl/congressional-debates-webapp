Report of Lieutenant Colonel Marsh B. Taylor, Tenth Indiana Infantry.

CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee,

December 1, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor of making herewith my official report of the late battle:

On the morning of the 23rd November, 1863, I received orders to hold my command in readiness to move at a moment's notice, with two days' rations and 100 rounds cartridges to the man. About 4 p. m. I joined the brigade in front of Fort Negley, closed en masse, my position being in the reserve, with the Fourteenth Ohio, the Tenth Kentucky, Fourth Kentucky, Thirty-eighth Ohio, and Seventy-fourth Indiana being the advance. We remained in this position until the morning of the 24th, when the brigade was ordered to the left and front. After forming our line of battle, pickets were posted and remained until relieved on the morning of the 25th. Immediately the four left companies were ordered out as skirmishers, but were soon withdrawn. We were then ordered to the left next to the river, and marching and countermarching we were formed in line of battle about 2 p. m., my regiment being in reserve of the brigade with the Fourteenth Ohio. After remaining in this position about two hours, we were ordered forward to storm the ridge, and in so doing were exposed to a raking fire from commanding positions on the top of the ridge. We succeeded in taking the ridge. My command lost 11 wounded. We remained in this position until next morning, November 26, when we were ordered to Ringgold, Ga.

The officers and men of the regiment behaved with great gallantry.

Hoping this report will meet with your approbation, I am, very respectfully,

MARSH B. TAYLOR,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Comdg. Tenth Indiana Vol. Infantry.

Captain A. J. DAVIS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
