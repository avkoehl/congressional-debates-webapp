In the afternoon of the 24th, by order of Major-General McCook, a reconnaissance was made for the purpose of ascertaining the strength and character of the force in our front. The Twenty-second Regiment Indiana Infantry and the Seventy-fourth Regiment of Illinois Infantry, under the command of Colonel Gooding, advanced about half a mile, when their skirmishers developed a heavy force of infantry in a defensible position, upon which the reconnoitering force was withdrawn.

Too much praise cannot be awarded to the officers and men of this command for the energy and vigilance which they have constantly exhibited during the laborious operations of the month. I have received the most cordial support at all times from the regimental commanders, and the through discipline of Colonel Gooding, the coolness and determination of Colonel Marsh, and the activity and prudence of Colonel Bennett and Lieutenant-Colonel Winters are especially commended. Captain Gardner and his lieutenants have exhibited great zeal and ability in the management of the Fifth Wisconsin Battery. Sergt. Charles Allen, of the Seventy-fourth Regiment Illinois Infantry, in the performance of a delicate and important duty, displayed much tact and gallantry. I am particularly indebted to the several members of my staff for the efficient assistance which they have rendered day and night throughout the campaign.

The conduct of Captain Samuel West, acting assistant adjutant-general, at all times prompt, able, and discreet, and Captain Robert Hale, who with his usual intrepidity, twice succeeded in communicating with you when none of the Cavalry Corps were able to do so, was worthy of their high reputations. Both officers have endeared themselves to the command by their services on other battle-fields, and their behavior, ad well as that of Captain Hatch, brigade inspector, and Lieutenant Mason, aide-de-camp, deserves the highest praise.

I inclose a list of the killed, wounded, and missing from the brigade.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. SIDNEY POST,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade,

Captain T. W. MORRISON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, First Division.
