RELAY HOUSE, October 15, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel LAWRENCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The rebel force that crossed Noland's Ferry yesterday came up as far as Buckeystown, about 100 strong, and went back after a very short stay. My little cavalry force was trying to take care of our own and the Department of Washington, and were too far down to get up in time to take charge of the fords in the Department of the Shenandoah. One company (Captain Churchman) reached the river just as they were crossing, and gave them one volley. Am I expected to guard the fords above the Monocacy, out of this department, as well as those in Department of Washington?

Brigadier General E. B. TYLER,

Relay House, Baltimore and Ohio Railroad:

General Halleck evidently looks to you to guard all the fords of the Potomac as far up as Point of Rocks at least. Can you not use infantry some? Four companies of Veteran Ninety-first New York were ordered to report to you. These, with the other five companies, are all that were sent. An ammunition train was sent. Please report its arrival.
