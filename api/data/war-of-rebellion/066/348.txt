Colonel R. H. ANDERSON,

Commanding Cavalry, Army of East Florida:

COLONEL: Lieutenant-Colonel McCormick, Second Florida Cavalry, was called on some time since for an explanation relative to the affair at Camp Finegan. The explanation as furnished failed to satisfy General Beauregard, and further information as to certain points was called for. This has not been received, and General Beauregard is very desirous that it be furnished at once. The major-general commanding desirers that you impress upon Lieutenant-colonel McCormick the necessity of his immediate compliance with the call.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. G. BARTH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Lieutenant-Colonel HARRIS,

Commanding Cavalry, Waldo, Fla.:

COLONEL: Your dispatch of this day's date relative to the landing of the enemy at Palatka is received. I am directed by the major-general commanding to notify you that a brigade of infantry and a battery of artillery is now in readiness to move to your support as soon as necessity may require. Meanwhile you will watch the movements of the enemy, skirmish with him and retard his movements, if he moves out from Palatka toward the interior, and keep the major-general commanding fully informed of anything you can discover as to his movements and intentions. In conducting this operation you will be careful not to so weaken or contract your picket-lines and scouting parties as to endanger his flanks.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
