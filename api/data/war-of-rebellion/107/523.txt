Lieutenant Colonel A. V. COLBURN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Your dispatch of 1 a. m. received (at 12 o'clock last night). I waited until 2 a. m. to-day and found New Creek all quiet. Messenger in from Patterson's Creek. Would not have Lander awakened and went to sleep myself. The Cheat Mountain line ought to be strengthened by five new regiments.

General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Wheeling, Va.:

The General-in-Chief directs that the three Ohio regiments and one battery, now at Grafton, proceed forthwith to New Creek, there to be temporarily subject to the orders of Brigadier-General Lander.

PATTERSON'S CREEK, VA., February 2, 1862.

General MCCLELLAN:

Will you oblige me so far as to order the three Ohio regiments and one battery now at Grafton to New Creek. I am advancing and need them to hold that position. Beat the enemy out of Springfield to day, leaving him at Romney. My scouts report him about 6,000 and two batteries. I shall take Romney or be defeated within forty-eight hours.

Respectfully,

F. W. LANDER.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Washington, D. C., February 2, 1862.

General F. W. LANDER:

Ohio regiments and battery ordered temporarily to New Creek. In attacking Romney you must use your discretion and be certain that the enemy is not re-enforced from Winchester. Do not advance beyond Romney. Banks needs time to prepare to co-operate, and you would be in danger east of Romney if he were not in position to distract enemy. If you gain Romney look out for return of Jackson, whom I know to be a man of vigor and nerve as well as a good soldier.

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
