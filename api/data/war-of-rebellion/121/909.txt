ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington, May 10, 1866.

SURGEON-GENERAL U. S. ARMY:

SIR: The Secretary of War directs that I inclose to you a copy of the report of Surg. George E. Cooper, dated the 9th instant, relative to the health of Jefferson Davis.*

I am, &amp;c.,

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DISTRICT OF FORT MONROE,Fort Monroe, Va., May 16, 1866.

General E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose report of Surgeon Cooper concerning health of state prisoner Jefferson Davis.+ I would earnestly request that as Mrs. Davis is here and there seems to be a decided effort being made by his friends to create sympathy for him and circulating erroneous reports regarding his treatment and condition, which are alike discreditable to the Government and myself, I may be allowed to admit reliable representatives of the press inside the fort that they may give to the country the true facts in the case as they are, and I feel confident that there will be no reason for complaint either regarding his condition or treatment.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

NELSON A. MILES,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE GULF,New Orleans, La., May 16, 1866.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL U. S. ARMY, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: Referring to your letter of the 7th instant directing the release of Doctor Gwin "upon the parole usually required in such cases," I have the honor to report that he has given his parole and has been released.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DISTRICT OF FORT MONROE,Fort Monroe, Va., May 17, 1866.

General E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General:
