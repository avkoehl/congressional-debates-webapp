RICHMOND, VA., April 22, 1865-2 p. m.

(Received 4.30 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of war:

On full consultation with General Ord we are of the opinion that it will be best to revoke all trade permits for any part of the State of Virginia; to open Richmond to domestic trade, and to prohibit all trade outside our military lines. These orders should take effect, say, on the 1st of May. In the meantime free access to Richmond from the North to be permitted. This will give us some trouble here, but it will prevent monopolists with special trade permits from swindling those who have anything to sell. There are men here with special permits of the late President to trade to the amount of millions. They have a most injurious effect. From all I can learn Richmond is to-day more loyal than washington or Baltimore. The people acknowledge that they are thoroughly conquered.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, April 22, 1865-4 p. m.

(Received 5.30 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Richmond:

The truce entered into by General Sherman will be ended as soon as I can reach Raleigh. Move Sheridan with his cavalry toward Greensborough as soon as possible. I think it will be well to send one corps of infantry with the cavalry. The infantry need not go farther than Danville unless they receive orders hereafter.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
