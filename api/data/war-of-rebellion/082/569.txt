Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

Torbert's and Gregg's divisions were attached this a.m. by Kershaw's and Wilcox's divisions, not far from the intersection of the Charles City road and the New Market road, and to the left of that intersection. They at first drove in my picket-line, which had been re-enforced strongly, to my second line. We charged them, the lines being only thirty yards apart, and routed them, capturing the colors of three infantry regiments and 150 prisoners. The balance of Hill's corps crossed the river last night. The enemy's movements this a.m. have been toward our right flank. My loss this a.m. will not, I hope, exceed 200. The prisoners captured by me belong to two divisions of the enemy and three different brigades.
