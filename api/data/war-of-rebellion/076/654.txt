General HOWARD:

I think it will be as much as we can do the first day to get General Williams down to the bridge, and General Stanley south of Proctor's Creek. Consult with General Thomas as to the first move.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 24, 1864-7 p. m.

General HOWARD:

I have been out all day to the river - the railroad bridge and Turner's; will move my camp to-morrow to Utoy Creek, below General Hascall. The telegraph wire will be gathered in to-morrow at 9 o'clock, so make your dispatches before. I would rather have your left near where it is, and unless you and General Thomas have made other arrangements, will instruct him to have General Stanley also stop at least a division about the Turner's Ferry road, so as to support your left to-morrow night and next day.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,August 24, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have seen General Thomas and learn from him that he intended to cover the movement of the Twentieth Corps with Fourth Corps near Proctor's Creek, and then move the Fourth Corps at once in rear of Fourteenth; and I have already made a new flank near Ezra Church and given my orders to withdraw the Sixteenth and part of the Seventeenth into the new works in conjunction with General Thomas' first movement. I could not fight a battle on the old ground unless the enemy would come square in front. If the Fourth Corps stops on that flank all right, otherwise I should prefer to withdraw into my new lines.

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 24, 1864-8.15 p. m.

General HOWARD:

Yours of August 24 is received. All right. Make the movement to-morrow night and next day according to your better knowledge of the ground. Take due precaution that all your trains are covered or moved behind the Chattahoochee, under protection of the Twentieth Corps.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
