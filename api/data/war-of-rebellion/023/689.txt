Major J. A. BROWN,

Chief of Artillery, Chattanooga, Tenn.:

In addition to 1,500 arms already sent, 700 will be forwarded to-morrow. Will you have unarmed troops to take al these arms? Five hundred stand should supply the effective force of a regiment. Retain arms for unarmed Florida regiment, unless by enemy. When you have accomplished all the good you can at Chattanooga and no prospect of immediate attack return to headquarters.

Brigadier General C. L. STEVENSON,

Commanding, &amp;c., Cumberland Gap, Tenn.:

GENERAL: It has just been reported at these headquarters that twelve regiments of infantry and ten pieces of artillery with large wagon train passed Fincastle yesterday morning en route for Wilson's Gap. After their junction with the force at that point they were to move to Cumberland Gap. Be on your guard and endeavor to evacuate your post before the enemy reaches your rear. Keep the commanding general apprised of your movements and govern yourself by circumstances. He relieves much upon your good judgment in conducting the matters with which you are charged. The commanding general also directs me to say that you must give Barton instructions when fall back toward this point. Six thousand rations have been sent to Maynardville, and four wagon loads of corn for his use should he move by that route.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. BELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
