H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Last night, when I came to send off the Seventeenth and Eighteenth New York Militia, which had arrived, I found their aggregate only about 400, and men and officers so raw and ignorant of the simplest things, that I considered them not only of little account, but unsafe. I put them in the fort, and took out of the garrison, and sent to Harper's Ferry instead, the Eighth New York Heavy Artillery, who are admirably trained, also in infantry drill and tactics, and thus have given Meade a first-rate regiment, of about 560 effective men.

SANDY HOOK, July 10, 1863.

General SCHENCK,

Baltimore:

SIR: Had a flag of truce to Harper's Ferry to-day to get a child across. Learned that rebels there are in ignorance of events. They seemed to think we were cut off from Baltimore. Wanted to know the name of commanding general. Found out that the pontoons coming down the river are some that were lost a week and a half ago; that they thought Lee in Frederick, and that he had captured thirty-six regiments. Too hazy to see Williamsport.

JOHN R. MEIGS,

Lieutenant, Commanding Iron-Clads.
