Numbers 3. Report of Brigadier General Philip St. George Cooke,

U. S. Army, commanding Cavalry Reserve, of the battle of Gaines' Mill.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY RESERVE,Camp on James River, July 3, 1862.

SIR: I have the honor to report the operations of the Cavalry Reserve in the battle of June 27. Its extraordinary duties and exposure for the day or two previous in covering the right and rear of the army had caused the detachment of about half of my forces, under Brigadier-general Emory, and which that morning were ordered to retire on a different line.

Of the First Brigade there were present two and a half squadrons Fifth Cavalry,, and three squadrons Lancers, Colonel Rush' of the Second Brigade, Colonel Blake, only two skeleton squadrons First Cavalry, and the provost guard, under Lieutenant-Colonel Grier.

About 6 o'clock p.m. I observed all the infantry of the left wing, in rear of which was my position, giving way, and three batteries, which in reserve positions had been silent the whole day, opened a violent fire upon the advancing lines of the enemy. Without orders, of course, I instantly conducted the Fifth and First Cavalry to the front, and deployed them in two lines a little in rear of and just filling the interval of the two right batteries. This was under a warm fire of musketry and shell. I instructed Captain Whiting, commanding the Fifth, to charge when the support or safety of the batteries required it. I instructed Colonel Blake to support the fifth and charge when necessary.

I then galloped to the left, and placed the Lancers on the right of the third battery-Second Artillery, Captain Robertson. I found it limber-
