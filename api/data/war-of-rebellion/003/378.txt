The American flag floating over the post-office was to-day taken down by a mob, headed by Jeff. Thompson and others, and the States rights flag hoisted in its place. The flag was torn in shreds. The postoffice is threatened. We are not frightened, but have no arms to resist. Cannot these leaders be arrested?
