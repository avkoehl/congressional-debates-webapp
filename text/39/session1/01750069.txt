THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
Mr. ASHLEY, of Ohio. I object to that.
The SPEAKER. The Chair decides that
this is not a question of privilege.
Mr. SMITH. 1 offered it in conjunction with
the credentials.

make it a question of privilege. Persons claim-
ing.seats here cannot have the privileges of the
floor granted to them as a question of privilege.
It is a question of privilege to present creden-
tials.
Mr. SMITH. Then I ask unanimous con-
sent to introduce the resolution.

that the Representatives of a free and loyal constitu-
ency should, at the opening of the first Congress after
the suppression of the rebellion, see that, in tho re-
organization and roadmission of the States recently
in arms against the Government, no possible safe-
guard be left unprovided which will prevent in tho
future a recurrence of the troubles of the past; and
whereas an attempt t,o assume the rebel debt in some
shape, and to repudiate the national debt in some
manner, and also to pay for tho slaves who have been
mado free, are among tho possibilities of the future;
and whereas the most effectual way of preventing
either or all of these would be so to amend the Con-
stitution of the United States as to preclude for all
time to eome any chance of cither of these results:
Therefore,
Be it resolved, That, in the opinion of this House,
tho Constitution of the United States should bo so

class rule.
Mr. BAKER introduced the following pre-
amble and resolution, upon which lie demanded
the previous question:
Whereas class rule and aristocratic principles of
government have burdened well nigh all Europe with
enormous public debts and standing armies, which
press as a grievous incubus on tho people, absorbing
their substance, impeding their culture, andimpairing
theii happiness: and whereas tho class rule and aris-
tocrats element of slayeholding which found a place
in oar Republic has proved itself, in like manner,
hurtftil to our people, by degrading labor and pro-
hibiting popular education in a large section of the
country; by striving to rend our Union in fragments;
by causing the blood qf hundreds of thousands of pa-"
triots to flow, and by compelling the people to iiapose
on themselves a debt of European magnitude inde- â€¢
fense of liberty, nationality, and civilization on tjiis.,
continent: Therefore,
Resolved, (as the sense of this House,) That onoe for
all weshould have done with class rule and aristocracy,
as a privileged power before the law in this jjatioiw no
matter where or in what form they may appear; and
that, in restoring the normal relations of the States
lately in rebelli on, it is the high and sacreil duty of the
and to realize and secure the largest attainable liBorty
to the whole people of the Republic, irrespective of
class or race.
The previous question was seconded, and the
main question ordered.
Mr. BAKER. I demand the yeas and nays
on the adoption of the resolution,
Mr. JOHNSON. I desire to inquire of the
gentleman from Illinois whether this resolution,
includes the codfish aristocracy? [Laughter.]
The SPEAKER. That is in the nature of
debate, and is not in order.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I rise to a question ot
order. I believe this resolution refers to the
reconstruction of the States lately in rebellion,
and therefore must go to the joint committee -
of fifteen.
The SPEAKER. The Chair overrules the
point of order. The resolution adopted by the
House is that all papers which may be offered
relative to the representation of the late so-
called confederate States, or either of them,
shall be referred to that committee.
Mr. JOHNSON. I rise to a point of or<fer.
It is, that if this resolution includes the codfish
aristocracy, it should not go to the joint com-
mittee.
The SPEAKER. The Chair overrules the
point of order. [Laughter.]
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr.,). HUMPHREY. I move that the res-
olution be laid on the table.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. JOHNSON moved that the vote last
taken bo reconsidered; and also moved that
the motion to reconsider be laid on the table.
Mr. WENTWOIiTH. The motion to lay
on the table was not understood here. I hope
the gentleman from Pennsylvania will withdraw
the motion to lay on the table. My colleague
[Mr. Baker] is a new member, and I hope no
advantage will be taken of that, and that ho
may be allowed a vote by yeas and nays.
Mr. JOHNSON. It is too late to withdraw
the motion.
The motion to lay the motion to reconsider
on the table was not agreed to.
The motion to reconsider the vote by which
the resolution was laid on the table was agreed
to.
The SPEAKER. The question recurs on
