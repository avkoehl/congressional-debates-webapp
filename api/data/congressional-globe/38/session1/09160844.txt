THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

be paid under existing laws and regulations and
orders of the War Department to veterans re-
enlisting or persons enlisting in the regular or
volunteer service of the United States for three
years or during the war shall continue to be paid
from the 1st day of March, 1864, to the 1st day
of April, anything in any law or regulation to the
contrary notwithstanding; said bounties to be paid
out of any money already appropriated for such
purposes.
Mr. SCHENCK. I demand the previous ques-
tion on the joint resolution.
Mr. COFFROTH. I would ask the gentleman
to amend the joint resolution by providing that
all veterans who reenlist shall be credited to the
different towns and election districts from which
they come.
The SPEAKER. That amendment would not
be in order pending the demand for the previous
question.
Mr. SCHENCK. I withdraw the demand for
the previous question simply to say to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania that that is already the
provision of law, and if it were repeated twenty
times in this resolution it would not make it any
stronger. The law requires that to be done now.
Mr. COFFROTH. The Provost Marshal Gen-
eral has issued an order in antagonism to what
the gentleman states to be the law.
Mr. SCHENCK. Then he must be held to
obey the law. That is all I can say.
Mr. RANDALL, of Pennsylvania. I desire
to ask the gentleman whether any provision is
made in this resolution for giving bounty to the
heirs of those who lost their lives in the service
prior to July J 861.
Mr. SCHENCK. That matter is not relevant
at all to this resolution. This resolution merely
relates to the payment of bounties upon reenhst-
men tor enlistment, ex tending the time from Match
1, when the law expires, to the 1st of Apnl, so
as to promote enlistments and prevent the neces-
sity of a draft, i now demand the previous ques-
tion.
The previous question was seconded, and the
main question ordered, and under the operation
thereof the joint resolution was ordered to be en-
grossed and read a third time; and being engrossed,
it was accordingly read the third time.

that the law passed at the last session of Congress,

asmuch as it piovtded no means for paving the

a difference.
