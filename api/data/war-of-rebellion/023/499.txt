General C. C. GILBERT,

Commanding, &amp;c., Louisville, Ky.:

GENERAL: Make use of your cavalry as far as possible in scouring country in advance of Louisville; keep me advised of Granger's movements if you can learn of them and of any information regarding General Buell. If Terrill can possibly be spared temporarily send him here; I need him much.
