CASTLE THUNDER, Richmond, October 25, 1862.

Mr. WOOD, Commissioner of the United States.

SIR: I am private of Company D, First Battalion Connecticut Cavalry. On Tuesday, the 6th day of October, 1862, I was detailed by Captain L. N. Middlebrook, who was stationed with his company at Fairfax Court-House and Countervail, Va., to go to Thoroughfare Gap of Bull Run Mountain for the purpose of watching the enemy. One man was detailed each day for that purpose. After I had passed Haymarket I was captured by eleven members of the Twelfth Virginia Cavalry who got not my rear. I was mounted upon a gray horse with my military saddle and armed with my revolver. My company are without sabers. I was clothed in my uniform. As I was coming up to Haymarket I found on the road a gray jacket which I put on every my blouse as it was a very cool morning, I have been informed that I am charged with being a spy. I claim the protection of the United States.

Yours, truly,

C. H. MARSH,

Private, Company D, First Battalion Connecticut Cavalry.
