NEW BERNE, March 24, 1865.

Major- General SHCOFIELD:

I find tow detachments for General Terry's corps. One of these has abut 800 men and the commanding officer is Captain Papemeyer, the only officer. THe other has 600 men, under a Lieutenant Reid. These were all ordered to be in readiness to go to the ront to- nigh at 8 o'clock. A small guard is with each of these detachments. I wuld resepctfully request that all officers in command of troops temporarily within the limits of my command be directed to report to me. I have no desire to interfere in any way with troops thus situated, but the end of the month is approaching and I presume a return will then be required of all treoops who may be int he limits of my command. ninety men of the One hundred and second Colored Regiment have just arrived here. The regiment is, I learn, at Savana. Had not these men better be attached to the colored regiment at morehead!

Very resepctfully,

I. N. PALMER,

Brigadier- General.

Brigadier-General PALMER, New Berne:

Your diispatach is recived. I will order the commandes of all detachments to report to you, as you suggest. I don't know about the coloired troops. Where did they come from a hd why sent to New Berne!Is not their regiment coming also! Send the detachments for General Terry by the Trent road to Fison's Depot, on the Wilmington railroad. Send a sufficient guard to keep them in order. Many of them are probably conscripts and substitures and will desert if they have a chance. All troops for the efront are to march. All recruits and small detachments are to be sent as soon as convenient. Organized bodies will remain at New Berne until further ordres.

Your last dispatch is received. From the best information I can get the colored troops belong to a regiment now doing garrison duty at Wilmington. They were ordered to join their regiment, and stopping at Morehead, were ordered off, it is siad, by Geenral Easton, and ordered up this way. I will get fullinformation of this as soon as I can comunicate with General Easton.

Very resepctfully,
