guns of the battery in this position, where it dealt the enemy heavy blows, Lieutenant Willinston moved one of his brass 12-pounders on to the skirmish line. In fact, the line was moved to the front to allow him to get an eligible position, where he remained with his gun, in the face of the strengthened enemy (who advanced to its very muzzle), dealing death and destruction in their ranks with double loads of canister. It was now dark and I was ordered to retire the brigade, which was done slowly and leisurely, the enemy not advancing. This day the loss of the brigade was heavy for the numbers engaged. The general advance was not made.

I cannot speak too highly of the battery on this occasion. The light 12's were magnificent. It has always been my good fortune while commanding the Reserve Brigade to have good batteries connected with it, and consequently our standard is high, but Williston and Dennison have always come up to our best expectations, if not exceeded them. At the fight at Cold Harbor, Dennison was inimitable, always in the right place; all orders found him anticipating almost what was intended, rushing his guns in position on the line of battle in the thickest of the fight. These two gallant officers can justly challenge a parallel to their conduct in the history of this war. At 1 a. m. on the 13th the brigade moved with the remainder of the command toward the North Anna, crossing at Minor's Bridge. On the 14th the march was continued, as also on the 15th, the Reserve Brigade, which formed the advance on that day, building a bridge over the Po River near Spotsylvania Court-House.

After this date the march was continued until the 25th, when the command reached the James River, having marched over 350 miles from the time of starting.

The losses in killed and wounded are annexed in tabular statement.* As they number more than the loss of the entire rest of the command they sufficiently attest the severe services of the brigade. We lost few, it any, prisoners during the entire trip, 10 or 12 men and officers covering all our losses in this way. On the other hand the brigade captured not much less than 500 prisoners in the time included above.

In mentioning those who were particularly distinguished for their conduct on all occasions I would not omit the name of Major Scott, of the First New York Dragoons. Always exposed while doing his duty, as few others in the brigade can, he was seriously wounded at Cold Harbor, but remained on the field until the battle was over. Our satisfaction at our successes is alloyed by the sad reflection that we lost so many brave soldiers and gallant comrades, who, while they fell battling in the cause of right, have left vacancies which, in too many cases, can never be filled; young officers who were just commencing a career of usefulness, of which the present offered such brilliant promise; others whose present services added fresh luster to the glories already won - all met the death of brave soldiers unflinchingly, leaving memories which cannot die. The modest, unaffected, generous Lieutenant Ogden, of the First, whom to see was to respect, and to know was to admire, poured out his life's blood at Trevilian. Here also fell the frank and impulsive Nichols, of the same regiment, and Henley, of the Fifth. Lieutenant Murphy, of the Sixth Pennsylvania Cavalry, was killed at Cold Harbor, making the third of the adjutants of this brave regiment who have fallen at the post of honor.
