••Noptoof ha-- heen offered in support, of the allegation
of the answer that they were earned over the roads of the

of tJui General Government. Should it appear befote the

The committee report that from September 1,
18G*2, to Jane 1, 1863, there wore transported
from New York to Philadelphia, over the peti-
tioners' roads, 17,4*33 men, 649 horses, and
808,245 pounds of freight, under the order of the
Government. That business was obtained by
their paying to the officers or persons who had
the control of that business twenty-five cents'a
head for each man, in order to get the business
over their roads. I assert that this is a fact, and
if any one dare deny it, it can be proved by affi-
davit, These companies presented an account to
the Philadelphia and Baltimore Railroad Company
for half of this bribery, winch the latter company
refused to allow, because they had arrangements
with the Camden and Ambuy lines to do their
through business; and at the same time the joint
compan.cs were ready to do that business, and
werfcin waiting for it. The joint companies have
always been ready and able to do more business
for the Government than they have ever been re-
quired to do. I refer the House, for proof of my
'assertions, to the affidavits of Edwin A. Stevens, j
Ira Bliss, John Simpson, James Honing, Geoige
B. Raymond, William II. Gatzmer, it. 8. Van
Rensselaer, and Walter Fieeman, Esquires.
