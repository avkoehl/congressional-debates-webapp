Mr. RANDALL. Mr. Chairman, 1 propose
to occupy the time allowed me to an examin-
ation of that portion of the bill under consid-
eration which relates to the internal revenue, to
determine whether the necessity exists for the
collection of such an amount as is now imposed,
and whether the levying and collectingthesame
is the best system which can be devised. The
President in his last annual message to Con-
gress made the following recommendation :
" I recommend that all taxes from interna]
sources be abolished except those collected from
spiritous, vinous, and malt liquors, tobacco in its
various forms, and from stamps."
Why should we not in the main follow his
suggestions? I am disposed to so act in ref-
erence to this subject, and I ask his political
friends in this House to give me encourage-
ment by their votes when J shall offer such
amendments to this bill as will go to reach a
practical adoption of his views.
■ The time has come when we can safely re-
lieve the tax-payers by a material reduction
of "the internal assessments, and relieve them j
from the present very many annoying modes i
of collecting such as we do assess. I
I hold that the revenue derived from inter- j
nal taxes should be confined to the following j
sources: distilled spirits, tobacco, snuff and ;
cigars, and fermented liquors. The necessities j
of the Government require that these taxes 1
should be continued, and as far as I am in- I
•formed the manufacturers do not offer serious j
objection thereto. The mode of collecting j
these taxes I propose to confine to stamps
exclusively, whereby we shall be able to dis-
pense with a large army of useless revenue
officers, such as assessors, assistant assessors,
and clerks, numbering about two thousand.
The annual cost of their retention in office is
about $3,500,000. At the proper time I shall
therefore give my support to the billintrodueed
by the gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr.
Dawes,] and which is said to have the un-
qualified approval of the Secretary of the i
Treasury, looking to this reduction of force
in the revenue department. :
The rates of tax which I will propose shall !j
bens follows: upon distilled spirits, seventy j|
cents per gallon, to be levied and collected as !'
now provided by law for the tax of fifty cents ;!
per gallon; upon tobacco and snuff, twenty- ij
four or twenty cents per pound ; upon cigars, ;!
one half cent, each; and upon fermented j!
liquors, ninety-six cents for every barrel con-
taming not. more than thirty-one gallons, and
at a Idee rate for any other quantity or for
any fractional part of a barrel authorized by
law. And a discount of ten per cent, shall
be allowed upon purchases of stamps repre-
senting the tax upon distilled spirits whenever
the tax upon such spirits is paid and the stamps
affixed at the time said spirits are drawn from
the receiving cisterns and gauged, and alike dis-
count upon stamps for tobacco and snuff' when
the tax is paid and the stamps affixed before
removal from the place ot manufacture; but no
discount shall be allowed in any other case.
Thus to impose a single tax of seventy cents
on distilled spirits in lieu of all taxes whatso-
ever now levied ; this I consider about tbe
same figure as fixed in the majority and mi-
nority report of the Committee of Ways and
Means, when we include the additional charges
they propose, which I altogether omit.
Under the present laws, there are nineteen
differenttaxes levied on distilled spirits, to wit:
1. Distillers, gallon tax, paid by stamps.
2. Distillers, special tax, assessed on annual list.
3. Distillers, barrel tax, assessed monthly.
4. Distillers, per diem tax on distilleries, monthly.
5. Distillers,distillery warehouse stamps.monthly.
6. Distillers, store-keepers' compensation,
monthly. '
7. Distillers, gaugers' fees, monthly.
8. Distillers, on sales not made at distillery, as
dealers.
Si. Rectifiers, special tax. annual list.
10. Rectifiers, barrel tax, monthly.
11. Rectifiers, stamps, monthly.
12. Rectifiers, gaugers' fees, monthly.
LI. Wholesale dealers, special tax, annual list.
14. Retail dealers, special tax, annual list.
15. Dealers, additional ta.x, on sales, monthly.
16. Wholesale dealers, stamps, monthly.
17. Wholesale dealers, gaugers' fees, monthly.
18. Manufacturers of stills, special tax, annual
list.
19. Stills and worms, monthly.
The amount of spirits produced under the
act of July 20, 1868; and from that period to
July 1, 1871, the production is reported at
181,091,420 gallons, an average per year of
60,363,807 ; and the amount of tax received
duiing the latter period at about seventy-three
cents, aud a few cents additional per gallon,
if we include storekeepers' charges and gaug-
ers' fees, was last year $46,281,848 10. The
manufacturer is willing to pay sixty-five,
seventy, or even seventy-five cents, provided
it is made one tax, to be paid the same as
tbe present gallon tax, on withdrawal from
warehouse, or at the still, with an allowance
of ten per cent, if paid in such manner.
The bill reported by the Committee of Ways
and Means proposes to consolidate the fol-
lowing taxes:
1. The tax of fifty cents per gallon, yielding last
year t $31,157,31-1 15
2. Per diem tax on distilleries  1,901.602 98
3. Distillers' special and barrel tax  5,683,077 31
•1. Distillery-warehouse stamps  249,699 00
Total  $38,991,693 44
for which a tax of sixty-five cents per gallon
is substituted.
The average product for the three years
ending June 30, 1871, was, as heretofore
shown, 60,363,807 gallons, which, at sixty-five
cents, would yield $39,236,474 55.
The other taxes from distilled spirits which
the committee propose to retain, exclusive of
the rectifiers' and dealers' stamps, are as
follows, for the collection of which an assess-
ment is required:
1. Rectifiers' special and barrel tax   $959,800 18
2. Retail dealers' special tax  3,651,484 73
3. Wholesale dealers'special tax  2,151,281 06
4. Manufacturers of stills, special tax  1.927 49
5. Stills and worms  3,240 00
Total  $6,767,733 «
recapitulation,
Last, year's revenue, $46,281,848 10. Of
this sum about sixteen million dollars was
assessed, the remaining $30,000,000 was col-
lected by sale of stamps.
Committee bili: by stamps, at .sixty-five
cents, $39,236,474 55; and by assessment,
$0,767,738 46; total. $46,004,208 01.
The amendment I proposed, say on an aver-
age of 60,363,807 gallons at seventy cents,
would yield $42,254,064 90.
The latter plan, as 1 suggest, would require no
assessments whatever, and hence a fair deduc-
tion of the cost of such assessments from the
amounts received last year, and from the esti-
mates of the committee's bill, should be made.
I find the cost of such assessments to have
been about two million dollars last year, and
I see no reason to think it would be less during
the coming year. Under the seventy cents
tax per gallon at still or in warehouse this
expense would be dispensed with, making the
figures in fact as follows :
Last year $46,281,848 10
Committee's bill, (estimate)  46,004,208 01
Amendment, at seventy cents per gal-
lon tax  42,254,664 90
When we consider the simplification, the
relief of all annoyances to the distiller, rec-
tifier, and the wholesale and retail dealer, I
think that this plan would be of great con-
venience. In addition I beheve the natural
increase in production, the impossibility of
fraud, and the indisposition to even attempt
fraud, would more than equal the apparent
falling off of $1,750,000 to $2,000,000 in the
revenue, and eighteen taxes would at once ba
dispensed with.

The present tax upon tobacco is thirty-two
cents on one class, and sixteen cents on the
other class.
