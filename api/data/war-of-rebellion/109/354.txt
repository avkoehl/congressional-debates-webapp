HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,Murfreesborough, April 22, 1863.

General SHERIDAN:

GENERAL: General McCook directs me to say that, inasmuch as it seems to have been intended that this brigade should remain in an advance position longer than one day, he thinks it best that Colonel Laiboldt's or some other brigade from your division should continue to hold some position in advance. General Johnson's brigade, under Colonel Gibson, is still on the Shelbyville pike, two miles in advance of Stone's River bridge, at Anderson's and the general directs that you place a brigade on the Middleton dirt road, abou as far to the front, so as to make a proper defensive line.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
