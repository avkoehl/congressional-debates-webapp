procure iron, I am driven with great reluctance to appeal to the Government for help. The old iron now on the track is the flat bar, which we will exchange with the Government, yard for yard, for T or U rail, we paying for the difference in weight if the Government can furnish the new iron. I know very well the difficulty that it will have to encounter in order to furnish this road with the iron asked for, but it has become indispensable to the continued use of the road, in my judgment and that of the superintendent, and, it not being possible for us to get the iron, no alternative is left but to appeal to the Government for aid. Without the use of this road I do not see how the necessary transportation for the army can be done, and it therefore becomes my duty to apprise you of its condition. The constant increase of prices paid in the Government shops for mechanics makes it impossible for us to procure and keep machinists enough to keep in repair our rolling-stock. That and the deterioration of the track for want of material presents a gloomy condition and calls for some action on its part. Every effort on the part of the management of the road has been made and will be continued to enable it to answer the calls made on it by the Government and community. I beg that you will give this matter your early and serious attention, as the exigency does not admit of delay.

Respectfully,

LEWIS E. HARVIE,

President.

ENGINEER BUREAU, April 7, 1863.

Respectfully returned to the honorable Secretary of War.

The condition of the Richmond and Danville Railroad, as represented, seems to demand that a portion of the iron taken from other roads (if it be decided to take it) should be applied to its wants. The removal of the rail from the York River road is now in progress, and it is hoped some will soon be obtained from the Norfolk and Petersburg road. In exchange for good iron the Government should have an amount of worn iron equivalent in value.

Colonel of Engineers and Chief of Bureau.
