APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
[February 2,
Ho. op Beps.
St. Croix and Bayfi&ld Railroad—Mr. Hay.
41st Cong....3d Sess.
Mr. Speaker, it is urged here with singular
boldness and confidence in support of this bill
that these land grants that Sre asked for will
benefit the people living in the sections of the
country through which it is proposed to build
these railroads far more than those to whom
the grants may be made. Nothing of the kind
is true. Sir, these grants are desired and
worked for by the railroad kings of our land,
who live in splendid and luxurious mansions,
for the purpose of still farther enriching them-
selves and still further extending and strength-
ening their power throughout the country. As
soon as this proposed grant is made the lands
will be immediately mortgaged to European
capitalists, and the money and credit thus
obtained will be used to build the road, and
afterward when the-country there shall have
become more settled and improved, and the
lands thereby greatly enhanced in value, as
they surely will, they will be sold to purchasers
for sums in the aggregate which will exceed
by millions of dollars the original cost of con-
structing the road.
No, sir; much as I am opposed to this whole
system of governmental interference with the
business affairs of the people, if I could ever
be made to believe that it was absolutely neces-
sary to build a few railroads in particular sec-
tions of the country, I do not hesitate to say
that it would be far better for the Government,
instead of giving away its lands to these cor-
porations to speculate in, to directly mortgage
them itself, raise the capital to build the roads,
and by its agents construct them, and then sell
the roads to such parties as might be willing
to purchase them, under wise and judicious
restrictions as to the particular manner of
their operation and management.
Mr. Speaker, the extent to which it is now
proposed to grant away the national domain
to corporations is amazing and startling to
any one who regards it of paramount import-
ance that it should be reserved for actual set-
tlers, for those who are to occupy and make it
productive. To me it almost seems incred-
ible that there can be any serious purpose in
the minds of the authors of the bills intro-
duced in the two branches of Congress to
accomplish what is proposed by them. It is
estimated that two hundred and twenty mil-
lion acres have already been given away by
Congress to corporations, of which one hun-
dred and fifty millions, at least, hafe been
given away within the last ten years. The
amountthus already given away is about equal
to the territorial area of the original thirteen
States. The honorable chairman of the House
Committee on the Public Lands has made an
estimate of the amount of the public lands pro-
posed to be given away by the land subsidy
bills which have either passed or are now
pendiag in the Senate. I give this estimate as

It will be seen that here are bills now pend-
ing in this Congress proposing to give away
over one hundred and seventy-three million
acres of the people's land, quite a number of
which have already passed one branch of Con-
gress ; and, sir, since I saw this estimate in
print about ten day3 ago on one single day
bills were introduced in this House proposing
to grant away eighteen million acres more of
the national domain, and within the last two
or three days other bills have been introduced
here providing for still further grants. If we
add what has already been granted away by
Congress to corporations to what in the aggre-
gate is now proposed we shall have the enorm-
ous sum of over four hundred million acres,
nearly equal to the entire area of twenty States
of the Union.
Sir, in order to adequately comprehend the
evil and disastrous consequences to the coun-
try of what has been aptly termed " this rob-
bery " of the national domain, it is only Acces-
sary that we should bear in mind that seven
hundred million acres is regarded as a high
estimate of the arable lands of the Govern-
ment now remaining, and many well-informed
persons hold that there cannot be many more
than five hundred million acres. Be that as
it may, even if we lake the higher estimate it
will not be much longer than two short gen-
erations, should our country grow in popu-
lation as rapidly in the future as it has in
the past, before all our public lands will be
required for actual settlement. Yet here is
a general system of land-grant legislation per-
sistently forced upon our attention daily and
advocated with untiring zeal and energy, the
effect of which is to vest the ownership of our
public lands in a few millionaires and power-
ful corporations, to the exclusion of that num-
erous class in every-country, the landless poor,
who will too soon need them for homes;
When we consider the immense quantities
of lands that Congress has already given away,
and what quantities it is proposed to dispose
of in the same manner by the bills now pend-
ing here, every thinking mind must naturally
turn to those countries where the sad conse-
quences of land monopoly are grievously felt,
and have been for ages; for the inevitable
tendency of our legislation in regard to the
public lauds is to that very thing. Itisesti-.
mated that one hundred and fifty persons are
the owners of half of all England, and one
fourth of Scotland belongs to five individuals.
Richard Cobden, not long before his death,
declared that the entire landed proprietors
in the United Kingdom did not number more
than thirty thousand, although in the year 1770
they numbered two hundred and fifty thousand,
and at the beginning of the present century
there were about two hundred thousand.
It will be seen from these facts, how dan-
gerously rapid the land of a country may pass
from the possession of the many to the few.
Down to a recent period, comparatively speak-
ing, the landed aristocracy in England held
the government of the country in their hands.
Says an English writer: " Monopoly of land
is the very fortress of the powers which the
aristocracy have over the rural districts.'' An d
sir, beneath the cold and chilling shadow of
that aristocracy has grown that great blot
on English civilization—pauperism—with the
long and dark catalogue of evils that ever trail
in its wake.
Mr. Speaker, to remedy the calamitous
results of this great danger that threatens the
very existence of the English nation is the
absorbing study of British statesmen. And,
sir, how strangely does our land policy con-
trast with that of those great liberal statesmen,
John Bright and John Stuart Mill and others,
on the Irish land question, and that policy
which has been in operation for the past twenty
years in Prussia, and which has been the means
of transferring a large proportion of the Prus-
sian territory from the ownership of the few
to the many, the occupiers and tillers of the
soil, just as that of Bright and Mill will in
Ireland.
There is not a statesman in any country of
Europe, who has the welfare and happiness
of the great body of the people as a cardinal
end in view in his ideas of government, who
would not, if called upon to pronounce judg-
ment on our land policy, say that it is the most
suicidal to the best interests of the country
that could be conceived. Instead of fostering
and encouraging a policy the effect of which
is to possess the few of the soil to the exclu-
sion of the many, every liberal and enlightened
statesman there is endeavoring to devise some
legislative policy whereby there shall be as far
as practicable a general division of the soil
among the people.
Another most baleful effect of this land-
grant system that has grown up here is the
encouragement it gives to combinations of
wealth to come here and demand subsidies of
money to aid any enterprise that may be had in
view. There are now bills pending before this
Congress providing that the Government shall
pay or obligate itself to pay fifty or sixty mil-
lion dollars to different corporations to assist
them in undertaking certain enterprises. Now,
I wish to say at this time that 1 shall oppose
all such measures. If there be one thing above
all other things we ought to strive to secure, it
is economy in the administration of the Gov-
ernment; and therefore not a dollar should be
appropriated for any purpose from the Treas-
ury beyond what is absolutely needed to defray
the expenses of the Government. Let all we
have there after this is done be faithfully ap-
plied to maintain its credit and lighten the
burden of the national debt. And the Repub-
lican party is pledged to this. No party is
entitled to the confidence of the people that
does not adhere to this policy, and no party
will long enjoy their confidence that does not.
