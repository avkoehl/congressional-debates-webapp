H)* all claims incurred by the several States of the Confederacy arising from the circumstances which impelled their action previous and subsequent to their several acts of secession are assumed by the confederate Government. The act, however, requires the Governors of the respective States to forward the claims to the Secretary of the Treasury, in order that they may be audited. They will have to be collected and thrown into shape by the several States, and for this purpose some provision having such object in view should commend itself to your consideration.

In compliance with a joint resolution of the Legislature "providing for the turning over of property now in the possession of the State, lately taken from the United States Government, to the Confederate States Government," and upon the arrival of the agents of the Confederate State, the ordnance and inspector-general and quartermaster-general, designated by the convention to take control of all such property, were ordered to turn it over to the proper agents. The property in charge of the ordnance and inspector-general was promptly transferred and the required schedule and receipts filled with the comptroller. It was impossible that the work of the quartermaster-general should be so rapidly completed. The property under his charge was turned over en masse in order to facilitate the operations of the Confederate Government in this department, but a considerable time has been required to receive and take receipts for the same, accompanies by schedules specifying each item and its condition.

He entered promptly upon his mission, but found it impossible to procure the rifles. The pistols, however, were secured, and have been of great service in arming the regimental called out by the convention. The claim for these arms, which is about $25,000, is due to a citizen of the Government with which we are at war, and it will devolve upon the Legislature to determine upon its adjustment. Some strenuous exertions have been made by the Executive to procure an additional supply of arms for the State, but this subject it is deemed prudent to make the substance of a special report to your honorable body.

Gentlemen, having fulfilled my constitutional duty, it is now my privilege to commit the government into your hands and into those of the distinguished gentleman whom my fellow-citizens have chosen to succeeded me, and who will co-operate with you in your future legislation. In the foregoing communication I have said only those things which the propriety of my situation would permit and which the most important necessities of the government demanded. It was sufficient that I should convey to you a succinct statement of the significant
