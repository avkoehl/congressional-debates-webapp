concentrate everything and not run the risk of engaging a desperate enemy with inferior force. All minor considerations should be thrown to one side and all our energetics and means directed toward the defeat of Johnston's army in front of Richmond.

Major-General, Commanding.

WILLIAMSBURG. (Received May 8, 1862.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

We have absolutely no information in detail of the country in our front and are obliged to grope our way. I would respectfully and earnestly urge that the Chief of Topographical Engineers be directed to lend me eight or ten officers junior to General Humphreys to move with this army until we have reached Richmond. Such a detail would save us many days in time and many lives. I cannot urge it too strongly.

All goes well.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have just received intelligence that our advance guard is in communication with General Franklin's command. The inhabitants report the force of General Franklin ad being from 80,000 to 120,000 strong. They are in full retreat on the line of the Chickahominy, where it is said that they intend to make a stand. Franklin's division conducted itself most gallantly. I move with my command to-morrow.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of Way:

I sent a party of cavalry to Jamestown to-day at 12 o'clock. They remained until tree-quarters of an hour after sunset. The officer reports that three side-wheel steamers passed up the river. He was informed by persons there that they were the Yorktown, Patrick Henry, and some other they did not know. Another party on proceeding some distance down the river saw the three steamers as they passed close inshore, and each bore the Confederate flag. I have heard nothing of Captain Rodgers. Can you give me any information as to his movements? When did he leave Fort Monroe?

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.
