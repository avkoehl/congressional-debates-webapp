General EWING:

There must be a mistake upon the part of your informant about the soldiers leaving Potosi. A gentleman who passed through there about 10 a.m.; told me that my troops were in the court-house. The scout I sent out found them there when they arrived, and your dispatch is the first intimation I have had that any of them left. I will have the matter thoroughly investigated and advise you of the result.

The general commanding desires to know whether General Wolff's brigade, at Jefferson City, is under his immediate command. He has no copy of order detaching any part of his command, which consisted of First, Second, and Third Brigades, First District Enrolled Missouri Militia. The State adjutant-general advises him that he knows of no order reducing his command.
