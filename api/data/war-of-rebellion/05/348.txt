GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,.

No. 64. Near Centreville, October 23, 1861.

The general commanding, in communicating to his army corps General Orders, No. 47, dated October 22, from the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac, must avail himself of the occasion to express his confident hope that all of his command, officers and men, by the brilliant achievement of their comrades in arms of the Seventh Brigade, on the 21st instant, will be assured of our ability to cope successfully with the foe arrayed against us, in whatsoever force he may offer battle. Under the inspirations of a just cause, defending all we hold dear on earth or worth living for, and with the manifest aid of the God of Battles, we can and must drive our invaders from the soil of Virginia, despite their numbers and their long accumulating war equipage.

Soldier of the First Corps! your enemy is demoralized by these defeats. His numbers give but temporary confidence, which at all times you can dissipate in an instant, when animated by the resolution to conquer or die facing him.

After the success of the Seventh Brigade in the conflict of the 21st of October no odds must discourage or make you doubtful of victory when you are called upon by your general to engage in battle.

By command of General Beauregard:

THOMAS JORDAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
