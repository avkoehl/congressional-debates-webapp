Tne power vested m this Government to pass uniform bank
mpt laws, construed as it has been to leave such power m the
S^tes fentil the national powers be exerc sed, was probably in
tended as ¿power of supervision and control, m ordet to pre
vent groas abuse on the part of the States There is no pie
tertce that such abuse has been attempted The States were
prohibited from passing laws to impair the obligation of con
tracts, but, under the bankrupt power, they might elude such
reamction but for this powei in the General Government of
supfirviston and control.
About the year 1827 the Supreme Court of the tntted States
deeded that a State insolvent or bankrupt law, discharging from
the contract, would be constitutional as to all contracts made m
the Sta'es between the citizens thereof aftei the pa&sage of such
law ennce that time, at least, it has been understood to be fairly
within the constitutional powers of the States to provide pro
spectively tor the absolute discharge of debtors on terms as
ea&y as provided by tbis bill The fact 13, I believe that with
this asc*.i tamed right in the States to give the option to every
debtor to be discharged from hia debts whenever his convenience
or capí ice sh ill dictate, on simply ay-igomghu pioperty as you
proviie 1n.thu.b1ll, no State has gone to such an extravagant
length towards abolishing probity and good faith, an J that no
¡state has done so, should be some evidence that the sobei sen e
oí the country does not require such leg slation The fact is
that piobuy and good faith ate things go convenient, so useful
in the transaction of private affairs, that the temptation to disre
gard them heldouteven by legislative authority cannot remain
long in vogue I have been ¡somewhat of an observer m my time
of the ebbs and flows of public feeling in favoi of this propensity
for relief and stop laws and legislating men out of debt In in
year 1311 the Legislature of New York were overwhelmed with
petitions and other demonstrations of popular opinion m favoi
01 &uch a relief law The embarrassments of business men
consequent on the embargo, non inteitourse, and oilier com
metcial troubles from 1808 had occasioned, as was suppostd
a pecuhai nece&sity for a relief law of a very liberal chaiactei
Well, under that impulse they passed the act of 31 A-pul,
"IB LI, commonly c died the jubilee act, very muchm pimciple
lice the voluntary part of this bill It was passed at the close
of the session, and its repeal was almost thehrst publn act
Ol the veiy next session That act was passed, as this will
V, not from any belief that the establishment of the trmcipie
of such ea&y dischaige frim pecuniary obligation, to opeiaie
on future transactions only, was essential to the weiiaie ol
the pe fie, but solely for its retroactive (fleets—solely iicm
sympathy for those embarrassed by their existing indebtedness
In that case the alleged suffciing was undoubtedly gieulyex
aggerated And m this case, the lact that the bt ito insolvent
laws wdl apply and afford relief to the extent that an enlight
ened public sentiment in the different States has sustained their
Ihegislaluresingoing, will show to what a veiy limited amount
the number of cases will be reduced where a necessity can be
claimed for this law from any deficiency ofpowei to piovide
for them by the ¡state systems The cases where tontucts
were made before the passage of the State insolvent or bank
rupt laws, and where the debts have not been contracted m and
due to the citizens of the same State, under whose laws the
discharge may be obtained,|are the only cases where the Statein-
h ivuii 1 iwa may not be or may be made entirely sufficient to
such discharge.of unfortunate or dishonest debtors is may be°t

SPEECH   OP MR. SERGSANr,
OP   PENNSYLVANIA
In the House of Representatives July 27   18H— On the btl!
m relation to duties an 1 drawbacks
The House being m Committee of the Whole on the state of
the Union an 1 having unüei consideration the bill in íeiation t>
uu íes inrtdi aw backs-
Mr  SERGEANT said that it must have been obvious to
every body, 1or some time pa t, that the sole question under di
cushion was the compromise act    Inat act they were to take
H-f the beginning of the present question, if ind *d it weie not
the beginning and the end    But Mr S should have ocrasion to
go further back than thatbegirmitie:    He would premise how
ever that to him it appealed disgiaceful for a nation in time ot
peace
to have its finances disordered and to be obliged to mn
in debt It must be obvious to all that there had b«en great
mismanagement to bung the nation into that condition espe
cially when the famine of national tesouices immediately fol
lowed a peimd of gieat abundance suchas had been enj >yed
by this Government in \83o and 1836 The nation at thattime
wanted some one to in eipret us dieam and could such acoun
Eellor have arisen no doub hesAstance of his. ínipif relation
would have been that glut ai 1 scircitv usually followed tach
other m quick succession Now, m «i tndmg to ill that had
b"<.n said here, v.hethet at the 1st sesión ot at the t re tnt, it
wa^evi lent that thi« nation in aumeof ptofiund p ace had
Ju 11 * fina ices gieatly deianged, and had been running prL ty
deeply into debt
Ihe geuieman from South Caí olma [Mi Hot <\ f« ] m count
In2 up the means of the Government, had leckoned its debt of
twelve millions as one item of its mean5! but an mliviclnal,
■when runnmrt in debt, if he were a prudent man, wmld fiut
looihow his debt was tobe pa d, and certainly would not count
upon his debt as his means of living If he did the en 1 w uld
easily be foreseen What would be thought of an individual
yhe should naalie such a calculation?  But, for a nation to do
so m the management of its concerns, in time of peace, and
with imple resources was, he would not say still wojse foi he
would not undertake to graduate such things, but still more un
promising When the lieasuiy was m want, and the public
finances in a state of disorder—when a nation like some hard
run individual, spent the forenoon m agony, devising means to
provide for the urgent demand of the moment, and the after
noon m anxiety how to provide for the next morning, it must be
obvious to every ob^erverthatitsaffairs were in a posture which
needed immediately to be attended to, and to be well and care
fully regulated Mow look at the past Administration of this
Government While it was issuing Treasury notes and hunting
up sciaps of money wherever any balance could be found,
makm" u«e of tnw money, and availing itself of eveiy little
lent that could be turned to account, to meet us liabilities
what became of he gieat interests of he nation1] The navy,
the ai my. the foi ificaüon", works of internal improvement the
defence of h ib its, in short, every gi eat interest that ought to

taceful sate of public affairs, an J it called loudly upon the
m con m0- A Imihstratian to apply then whole energy to cot

Such a plan was no longer advocated it might possibly have
some two 01 three gentlemen yet m its favor but the abj etions
to it were too obviuus and too sieat to allow it to be counte
naif ed It was a plan w hich had not kept i's promise When
Congi"-"4? were ask^dfor the first emission uf five millions they
\fie told that tlm emission would be the last, that the mcom
11 g revenue wou'd meet the notes and no more need ever be i&
sued That was the promise how u had been fulfilled every
body knew Moie and moie, and yetmoie notes had been is-
sue 1 until tl e e weie now nine mil ionb of dollars of them to
be provided for The Government is authorized to borrow
tWt-lve milhon-i and have une millions of Treasury notes to
pi\ What was the fief duty of Congress at such a cris s? Its,
duty was to fill the lieasury—to provide the whole ampunt ne
cessary to mettthept bhcexpenditures and then to form plans
for ihe futuie, which it should be able to act up to Might Mi
S venture to s*y that foi nine years past, there had been no
taieful, methodical iramgement of the public finances evei
thought of? We had had, indeed, plenty of Congressional dis-
cussions on all sort*, of questions but the great difficulty had
bum the want of a plain oideily, intelligible arrangement of
the finance^ The cal ed session of Congiess in loJ7 had done
nothm"" m the woild but au honze the Govert ment to run m
de-bt and tl e Government had done little else from that time to
ilmbutu ixtcute thisauthonty ivowamlhert, was witnessed
the first a tet j t to burg the public finances into astattofor er
tyho r^tiy ir is>tftematically bringing upthe means of the Go
vt,rnmcnt to theiateoi its expenditure We had been living,
year alter yeai liom hand to meuth, leaving to morrow to take
care of the things of it-self until to morrow at last (as might
have been foreseen) had not ung to take care of and then we
wtnt tobouowing This was the consequence, the inevitable
cons^qut-nce of having no system, no large, straightforward,
anl pumanentariarigement to provide for the wants of the
Treasury
Mr   had said that the begmmngand end of the present dis
cub-sum seemed to be the compromise act That act passed on
the 2d Match, 1S33, and seemed, in the views of some gentle
men, to have been a final settlement of all revenue question*,
once and foitver The argument here bad not m terms been
quite as limited as that in the report of a foimei Secie arv of
theTieasury who had declaied that, infirm the compromise
waq an act of legislation but that its consejuences wep1 suefj
that certain pn cij les weio to be inferred from it as having
beenset'le 1 which pnnciples the secretary went on to detail,
until he auive I at a result utterly si ockin^ to the chief pur
I o e as 11 iw dlle^ed of ihecomprom seitself In a circuitous
wav he r >mes to the conclusion that, in laying duties within the
limitations of that act Congiess may discriminate so as to give
I rotection to \meucan manufactuies This, tobe sure, is a
very small reserved right but utterly repugnant to the argu
ment employed in this House What weie the direct ejects
achieved by the compromise act! For if it really* had the ef
feots iscribel to it, it w^ nothing less than a aecon 1 Coustitu
tion of the I nited States piescubing to the legislation of the
peiple by their lepre^entatives, limitations of their power
wholly unknown to the fiist Constnuti n—declaung what
should and what should not be done by Congress previous to
the year 1-42 and then presenbmg what should be doneafer
the year lb42, and taking away the right ever todo any thing
else Mi s was not spt/tkmg of the actual, real effect of that
law it went far enough in its terms, much too far to be con
sistent with the Constitution but the construction aven to it
went far very far beyond the act itself, under the notion of the
apuitof the iet Whenever the House undertook to pass a
revenue billl the cry was "lake care' you must n tgiveup
any item win bin0 he reto foi e been asource of revenue if you
do you will violate the compromise act—that is, you will vio

oT-se 11 ie act oí July 1832 which you will observe was to go
Into operation on the 3d dav of March, 1833 What was the
obj ct and what the method of that act? Its object was appa
rent on its face and so wa^ the method of accomplishing it
Dare Mr S say that its object was two fol 11 Yes he would
s^y so because such was obviously the fact, and to this fa^t we
mus refer for what afterwaids occu red, and for the^oolled
compromise act itself The evident policy of the act tht n be
b^vpfl to be the true po icy of thena ion, was first to protect to
a certain extent ihe manufactures of this country, and feennedy
to iiminish the total amount of leverueto what was required
foi the expenbesof the Government And how did the act
proceed morder to effectuate its policy'* It proceeded wisely,
with reference to the end in view It rétame 1 existing duties
on articles which competed with our own manufacture* th a
was for protection, it then took off or reduced thedu íes on ai
tides which did not socompete, some were made free, others
were put at a low rate of duty

He Ind had nothing to do with it He did not speak from any
knowledge or recollection of lus oft n He spoke from the la
^iblativt. histo y, opci equally to II, anl clear upon its face
It wasmamffstly in accordance with the message f the Presi

Conarre s of 1832 was to reduce du ie<* to an amoun eqjal to
the doman Is of thu Government, by taking them off ft om a
class of arncies which did not lnterfeie with our own manu
factures Did that Congress take up the whole list of m
porte 1 article*, and examine simply which of them m a meie
fiscal viev., 01 m point of convenience, was the c t "uited to
beat the imposition of d dut)? Not at all Did they mean,
for example todpenmate between articlesof luxury and am
cles of necessity1 Certainly not The act took off or low ei ed
tl e duty onsnks and wine and left the duty on salt ]\o ns
single object 111 leaving certain a tides free was to reduce the
revenue leaving the whole of it upon aiticle^ which interred
with our produce or manufacture^. Mi S did not nt nd now
tosay whether this was right or wrong, but only th it si ch.
was the fact By the act of luly 1832 then, Congres* fiW
what amojnt of revenue should be named is adequa e to
meet the mdi per«ahie war ts of the Government It ai t ci
pa ed those wants ju tastiuly as Congress could now anuci

Both points were adjusted—the amount necessary f r an eco

be -aiped The rever ue given by that act was untleistood to be
the amount

It was not to settle the revenut   not to den Tew here it sW uld
