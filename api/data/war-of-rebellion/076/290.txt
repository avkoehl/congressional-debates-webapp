HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., July 29, 1864.

General THOMAS:

Until the result of our cavalry is known, I want the utmost activity on our flanks. General Howard but this time must have his line strong. I wish you to take General Davis' division and one of General Williams' and operate from General Howard's right flank toward east Point. Don't form a line, but move so as to occupy or threaten the railroad. General Schofield will do the same on the left. I will stay at home to-day to be convenient to the telegraph. Keep me well advised. Don't extend the line permanently, but operate in the nature of a strong reconnaissance toward East Point, having General Howard's lines as a point of departure and safety.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

General THOMAS:

Have those two divisions moved to our right, and when? General Howard reports that appearances are that Hardee's corps is between his right and Turner's Ferry. If so, we ought to strike it, or between it and Atlanta, at once.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

The two divisions were ordered our as soon as your dispatch was received at 7 a. m. Davis' division is moving now by Howard's right, and Ward' division is moving in support of Davis. I do not know what is on General Howard's right, as I have not heard from him to-day. General Morgan was ordered to move toward the railroad by Howard's right, in compliance with your orders.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,July 29, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have just returned from the right. I have intrenched Morgan on the Howell's (or Green's) Ferry road, to the right and southwest of Logan. He has complete control of that road, and has his skirmishers our half a mile to his front. They have driven the rebels into intrenched riflepits, and report intrenched lines heavily manned a short distance in rear of their skirmish rifle-pits. I also directed ward to take position on Morgan's right and refuse his right, so as to make a strong right flank.
