water-tight compartments, to have boats sufficient
to carry each, all, and every passenger; if they
have a mortar and a life-car, by which they can
communicate and become connected with another
vessel at sea; if they will have pumps, to be
worked by manual labor, and donkey-pumps to be
worked by steam; if they arc inspected every five
years, in order to ascertain their soundness; if
they are intrusted to able and efficient command-
ers', who shall have the whole, sole, and entire
control of them; and, above all, if they are in-
spected by local and supervisory inspectors, who
are purely actuated by conscientious motives of
official duty; 1 ask, in the name of common sense
and common justice, if the fearful, and I may
truly say, almost appalling risk that is now in-
curred, will not be greatly diminished ?
Why is it that we do not hear of these frightful
losses of life on European steamers ? It is from
the simple fact that ample means are provided by
law for their prevention, and for the insurance
of human life. Examine the laws of England
regulating her ocean steamers, and it will bring
a blush of burning shame to the cheek of every
one who is capable of feeling, when we compare
them with ours, and discover how infinitely su-
perior they are. The utter recklessness 011 this
subject which is now and has heretofore been
manifested by the " universal Yankee nation,"
cries aloud for a remedy ; and our national char-
acter as a humane, benign, and Christian people,
demands that we should pass some law by which
this wholesale butchery and indiscriminate slaugh-
ter of men, women, and children, upon our ocean
steamers, shall be stayed. When we do this, we
will have performed an act which will elevate us
in the standard of the civilized nations of the globe,
and will add additional reputation to us, as being
among the first in the great commercial and mari-
time world.
I cannot conclude my remarks without alluding
to the deep interest which the State which I have
the honor to represent feels on this subject. The
flag of our country announced, on the 10th of July,
1846, the conquest and occupation of California
by American valor. Gold was soon discovered;
and scarcely had the wonderful tidings been borne
by the gentle zephyrs of the placid Pacific to the
stormy shuies of the boisteious Atlantic, when,
as if by magic, the love of enterprise, the spirit
of adventure, so peculiarly characteristic of our
hardy and intrepid countrymen, was fully aroused,
{ind thousands left their homes and their firesides
to visit the golden land—
" Bearing tlieir hiitlirielit? proudly on their backs,
To make a liazfiul ot new fortune there.
Obstacles almost insurmountable seemed to
arise to arrest their onward march; the cold and
threatening Horn, the trackless desert, the bound-
less plain, the fatal rencontre, the tomahawk of
the relentless savage created no fear in the stout
hearts of these hardy adventurers, but like the old
guard of Napoleon, in their ruinous retreat from
burning Moscow, their courage only increased
with the surrounding dangers. It is these men
who have borne in triumph through every dan-
ger, every difficulty, and every hardship, the free
and enlightened principles of republicanism to the
far-otT shores of tlv Pacific, and have so nurtured
and cherished them that tliey now spread their
benign and genial influence over the oppressed of
every elmie. It, is tle-se men who now stand in
this Hall to-day, and ask you, through their Rep-
resentatives, that., in the name of their past ser-
vices, by the recollection of their past deeds, and
by the remembrance of the present ties that bind
them to you, you will save them from being sac-
rificed jnd immolated on the selfish altar of these
steam b o at monopo Iles.
The Cahfornia of to-day is far from being the
California of 18-16; for then she had only twelve
thousand beings, save the degraded aborigines;
now she has over a half a million population, and
her sea-going tonnage, in and out, is only sur-
passed by New York, Massachusetts, and Lou-
isiana. livery avenue of her glittering domain
is crowded with the sturdy sons of every clime;
whilst every State in our Confederacy has fur-
nished her quota. Few may be aware of the num-
ber of passengers and the amount of treasure that
are annually shipped from the harbor of San Fran-
cisco to New York. From information, through
a letter and statistics, kindly furnished me by the
distinguished collector of the port of New York,
1 have been able to ascertain nearly the precise
amount.

Collector's Office, January 22, 1858.
Sir : In reply to the inquiries contained in jour letter of
the 19th instant, I have the honor to submit the following :
The total number of passengers sailed from New York
for San Fiancisco, in steamships, from Januaiy 1,1856, to
January 1,1858, is 20,095. The total number of passengers
arrived at this port fiotn California, during same peiiod, is ;
17.161. The total tonnage of steam vessels running between
tins port and Aspmwali is 16,747 tons. No treasure has I
been exported from this poi t for Aspmwali during the above
period. The total amount of specie ainved at this poit in
steamships from Aspmwali, during same period, is, as per
inclosed statement, $72 951,363 68.
I have no means of ascertaining the tonnage of the steam
vessels employed in carrying pas?>eiigeis between Panama
and San Francisco, but t have no doubt you can obtain that
information at the Tieasury Department I shall be happy
at all times to furnish vou with any additional nifoiination
you may desue, if in iny power.
I am, veiy respectfully. ^ our obedient servant,
AUGUSTUS SC1IELL, Collector.
Hon. C. L. Scott, Washington, D. C.
From this we find that the total number of pas-
sengers from New York for San Francisco, from
1st of January 1856, to 1st of January, 1858, is
20,096;. the total number arrived at this port from
California during the same period, is 17,161; mak-
ing the aggregate number going to and'fro m two
years, 37,257. Now, it is reasonable to suppose
that one fourth of that number have gone by the
way of New Orleans, Charleston, and Havana;
which amounts to 9,314; which, being addedto
37,257, makes the whole number 46,671, which
is annually 23,285 passengets. As regards treas-
ure, $72,951,363 68 has arrived at the port of New
York from California; and acknowledging that
one fourth or fifth of the above amount has also
been shipped by the way of New Orleans, Charles-
ton, and Havana, it amounts to nearly ninety or
a hundred million dollars that has been shipped
from California in the last two years; and in this
calculation we do not include the millions that are
brought here by private individuals on their per-
sons.
Now, Mr. Speaker, I may say truly, and with-
out the fear of contradiction, that upwards of fifty
million dollars is annually transported from the
shores of my State to the Atlantic States; and that
nearly twenty-live thousand persons are conveyed
over the oceanic route that is traversed by the
United States mail steamship and Pacific mail
steamship companies semi-monthly.
"With these facts before us, does it not become
our bounden duty to throw some safeguard, to
give some protection, to this mighty interest, both
in human life and property—equal to any with
which this great Union is prominently and imme-
diately interested m, and dircctly identified with ?
I shall not now array before the bar of this House
either the United States mail or the Pacific mail
steamship companies; but the day is not far dis-
tant when, if an opportunity offers, I will cer-
tainly avail myself of it, and hold them to a strict
accountability for the deep wrongs and injuries
which they have already inflicted on my State.
When I reflect upon the loss of that ill-fated
ship, the Central America, how deeply impressed
I am with the urgent necessity of the passage of
this bill. I cannot refrain from paying a passing
tribute of respect and reverence to the memory of
those who perished on that sad and ever to be re-
membered day. Courage is indeed a noble qual-
ity, and none other elicits stronger admiration.
Many have immortalized themselves, and have
written their names high on the scroll of fame by
their deeds of valor amidst the din and carnage of
battle and the roaring and crushing cannon; but
the truest, the noblest,thepurest courage, is wlien
the soul of man quails not, but looks death calmly
in the face solely to maintain a principle or to ad-
vocate a right.
You may search the annals of history through,
and tell me where you will find a case on record
that will compare in heroism and true manly
courage to that which was exhibited by those four
hundred brave spirits that stood on the sinking
deck of the lost ship, the Central America. There,
far, far away from the distant land, with the wild,
surging, roaring waves dashing against their frail
bark, with the dark, gloomy, and lowering storm-
clouds casting the somber hue of a mighty pall
over them, did these men stand firm and undaunted,
resolved to save the weak and terrified women and
helpless children. They are gone, gone to that
bourne whence no traveler returns; no marble
monument marks the spot tyhere they sleep, for
the fathomless depths of the dark caverns of the
deep is their grave, and the chilly waters of the
restless ocean is their winding sheet. The eternal
heaving of the moving waves of the Atlantic chants
forth their fu neral dirge, whilst the low, whistling,
and sad moaningof the ocean winds singsasolemn
requiem in honor of their burial- Peace, peace
be to the respected and revered dead; for there is
not a mother, a wife, a sister, or one who bears
the name of woman, who will not drop a tear of
sympathy for these noble spirits, who perished
in such a holy cause.
They were our countrymen; and as such they
have added new and fresh laurels to our national
reputation, which each and all of you can appie-
ciate and admire in common; butto me they were
bound by stronger and more affectionate ties: they
were Californians; and as such a generous State
weeps and moans over the loss of her dead, whilst
she points with the finger of pride to their noble
deeds, and challenges the heroes of every land and
every clime to emulate them. God forbid thatever
the like should occur again; and it is for you to say
to-day whether you will shield and protect such
gallant men, by passing laws that will prevent the
repetition of such a calamity, or whether these
steamboat companies shall have unbridled license
to run their steamers, regardless of life. If you
adopt the latter course, the day is not far distant
when many of you will have to mourn over the
untimely end of some relative or dear friend, as
I do to-day over the loss of a host of friends.
Mr. TAYLOR, of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I
am not certain that the condition of my lungs will
enable me to be heard by the House, or that I
shall be able to say what I desire upon the sub-
ject before the House. Before I commence my
remarks, I submit the following amendment to
the substitute:
Add, as additional sections, the following:
That no insurance upon any vessel propelled wholly or
in parr by steam, and carrying pa^engers out of any poi t of
the United States to any poit ot a foreign nation, o> between
two ot most- of thf sevcial States, or between a State and
Terntoiv of the United States or in the Territories of the
United States, or upon the freight to be earned by s-aid ves-
sel, shall be effected by any owner ot such ve&sel, or b> any
person for the benefit oi advantage of any owner of the
j>ame, until all the provisions of law m leiauon to the build,
machineiv, and equipments of vessel5? piopelled in whole
or m pait'by steam, and edir>ing passengers, and intended
to guard against loss or danger Irom fire oi the explosive
force of steam, to prevent accidents tending to the injury
or loss ot passengers, and to aid their escape upon the oc-
currence of accidents, have been fully eoinph^d with ; aiiu
that if any insurance shall at any time be effected m viola-
tion of this prohibition upon any such vessel so earning
passengers, and such vessel bclonort-ufiei nijiny upon Use
voyase fiom any cause whatever, that then and m tnat
case, if the said provisions of law had not m point ot fact
been complied with, and the said vessel wai not in the eon *
dition picscnbed by law to build, machinery, and equip-
ments at the time of leaving port when the voyage be;:aii,
the said contract of insurance shall be, and the same is
hereby, declared absolutely null and void, and no ught ot
action of any kind whatsoever shall be had thereon.
Jhid be it farther enacted, That no person who was, after
the passage of this act, as engineer, in charge of an eneme
ou any vessel piopelled in whole or m part by steam, and car-
lying passengers as aforesaid, at the time when an e.\pio-
