FORT SUMTER, May 22, 1864 - 9.30 a. m.

SIR: Everything quiet here this morning. Enemy's barges came in again last night at 2 o'clock, between this fort and Shell Point, but did not come in so far as they did two nights ago. Six officers and 200 men Twentieth Regiment were relieved last night by 4 officers and 150 men Thirty-second Georgia regiment. Captain Bateman's company could not be carried by the boats and is still here.

Very respectfully,

FORT SUMTER, May 28, 1864 - 9.20 a. m.

Last night at 1 o'clock one of the enemy's barges fired a shot from a boat howitzer at the fort. At the same time they fired some small-arms at us. This was followed shortly by another, after which it pulled off in the direction of Cumming's Point. I did not fire at it. There was 1 Parrott shot fired at fort this morning which struck.
