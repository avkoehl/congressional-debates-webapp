transferred to the Confederate service on the 9th of September, 1861; stationed for a long time at the fortifications below the city, and on the 22 of November was ordered to Columbus. The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Regiments were so designated by the War Department, and are composed of the troops known as the Polish Brigade. They were are composed of the troops known as the Polish Brigade. They were not mustered into service of the State and transferred to the Confederate States, and consequently I have no record of their names, of the companies or officers, or number of men composing it. The Sixteenth Regiment was organized with Preston Pond, Jr., as colonel, Enoch Mason as lieutenant-colonel, and Daniel Gober as major; was mustered into Confederate service on the 29th of September, 1861. The Seventeenth Regiment organized with S. S. Heard as colonel, Charles Jones as lieutenant-colonel, and R. B. Jones as major; mustered into the Confederate service on the 29th of September, 1861, and is now at Camp Moore. The Eighteenth Regiment, organized with Alfred Mouton as colonel, Alfred Roman as lieutenant-colonel, and Louis Bush as major, was mustered into the Confederate service on the 5th of October, 1861, and is stationed above Carrollton. The Nineteenth Regiment organized with B. L. Hodge as colonel, J. M. Hollingsworth as lieutenant-colonel, and

major, and is stationed at Camp Moore. Five companies in May last organized as a special battalion, with C. R. Wheat as major, was accepted and mustered into service on the 6th of June, 1861, and ordered to Virginia. This battalion was in the battle of Manassas, and is reported as having performed deeds of valor. The foregoing regiments and battalions have been fully armed and equipped.

I annex a list of the regiments and battalions mustered into the State service and transferred to the Confederacy, with the names of the companies, the parishes from which they come, the names of the officers, and the number of men of each company, amounting to a total of 19,152 men. (See Document B. *) The President having the appointment of surgeons and quartermasters, the names of these do not figure therein. The names of some officers of companies do not appear on the list, owing to the fact that the changes being made by promotion or otherwise the officers to fill the vacancies were elected after the transfer to the Confederate States. On the 19th of April, 1861, the Secretary of War made a requisition for the First Company, Louisiana Foot Rifles, under command of Captain Henry St. Paul, which had been accepted for service. By Order No. 95, of that date, this company was transferred, but as no rolls of the officers and men composing the company were left with me, I am unable to state its force. Several other companies volunteered their services to the War Department direct and were accepted. I have no record of their officers and number of men. The parishes bordering on the Gulf coast were unprotected, and the enemy's fleet had been committing] and threatening attacks. Major-General Twiggs, commanding the department, deemed it necessary to call for troops to be stationed at the forts and at various points, so as to guard and protect the coast. Eighteen companies have been transferred for that purpose and are now in the active service of the Confederacy. Companies have been mustered into the service for service within the limits of the State. This necessitated the establishment of a camp of instruction in the vicinity of New Orleans. The location was selected near Carrollton, on the Carrollton railroad, and was called Camp Lewis.
