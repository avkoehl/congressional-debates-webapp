CAMP AT CENTREVILLE, VA., August 31, 1862.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by a portion of my brigade in the affair at Broad Run on the 27th instant:

About 7 a.m. I left camp at Warrenton Junction with the Sixty-third and One hundred and fifth Regiments Pennsylvania Volunteers. At Catlett's Station I was joined by three skeleton companies of the Eighty-seventh New York. Reporting to Major-General Hooker when the enemy appeared in front, I was directed to take my position on the left. Three companies of the Sixty-third Pennsylvania were deployed as skirmishers and ordered to hold the hill and woods on our left flank; the other companies of that regiment were ordered to support Randolph's battery. The seven companies of the One hundred and fifth Pennsylvania and the three companies of the Eighty-seventh New York were directed to support Durell's battery.

It is due to those regiments to state that, although exposed to a severe artillery fire, the duty was performed cheerfully and gallantly.

The only casualties were 1 killed and 2 wounded of the Sixty-third Pennsylvania and 1 of my orderlies, belonging to the Second Pennsylvania Cavalry, wounded. One of my aides-de-camp had his horse shot under him. I was struck by a piece of shell, but not injured.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. C. ROBINSON,

Brigadier-General.

HEADQUARTERS ROBINSON'S BRIGADE,Camp near Fort Lyon, Va., September 8, 1862.

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that in the affair of Chantilly, on the 1st instant, this brigade, with Graham's battery, was placed in line of battle on rolling ground to the left of the Centreville road. The Twentieth Regiment of Indiana Volunteers was directed to hold the woods on our right. The brigade was, by order of the division commander, held in this position until near night, when I advanced about half a mile. Soon after I received orders from Brigadier-General Birney, who had succeeded to the command of the division, to move to the right and front, when I formed the brigade in columns of regiments on his right, and there remained until the division was withdrawn at an early hour the next morning. In this engagement the brigade suffered no loss.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. C. ROBINSON,

Brigadier-General.
