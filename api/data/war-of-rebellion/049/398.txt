(Received 9. 30 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK:

No change in the position of the enemy or this army. Reconnoitering party this p. m. drove in the enemy's pickets at the railroad crossing, capturing a captain and 1 private of Ewell's corps. The enemy appear to have withdrawn the greater portion of the force they had on the north side of the river, keeping, however, a strong picket of infantry and cavalry. The pickets on the right flank at Waterloo report hearing drums about Amissville. The railroad is reported completed this evening to Warrenton Junction. I shall transfer immediately my main depots to this point and Warrenton. The army is now massed from Warrenton to Warrenton Junction, with one corps at Bristoe, the cavalry with some infantry picketing the river from Kelly's Ford to Waterloo.
