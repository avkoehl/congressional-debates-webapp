pressed him all the way to Beverly Ford, on the left. Our whole line followed the enemy to the river, skirmishing with his rear, and our line of pickets was re-established that night. Our infantry skirmishers, advancing through the woods, did not engage the enemy. About the time of General W. H. F. Lee's hot engagement on the left, I received intelligence of affairs at Stenesburg. The two regiments sent there failed to resist the enemy effectually, and one (the Fourth Virginia Cavalry) broke in utter confusion without firing a gun, in spite of every effort of the colonel to rally the men to the charge. This regiment usually fights well, and its tamped on this occasion is unaccountable. Colonel Wickham's report is herewith forwarded. The First [Second] South Carolina Cavalry (Colonel Butler), which had the advance there, had also a portion of its column thrown into confusion, which extended through the whole of the Forth Virginia. Owing to the casualties to officers of the First South Carolina Regiments, no report has yet been received of its operations. The movement of the enemy on Stevensburg ought to have been checked by the force ne there sufficiently long for re-enforcements to be sent. Attention is called to the accompanying reports of subordinate commanders for a more detailed account of their operations in this battle, and the names of those specially distinguished. Brigadier-Generals Hampton, W. H. F. Lee, and Jones were prompt in the execution of orders, and conformed readily to the emergencies arising. Brigadier-General Robertson kept the enemy in check on the Kelly's Ford road, but did not conform to the movement of the enemy to the right, of which he was cognizant, so as to hold him in check or thwart him by a corresponding move of a portion of his command in the same direction. He was too far offer me to give orders to do so in time. His detailed report will, I hope, account for this. * General Robertson's command, though not engaged, was exposed to the enemy's artillery fire, and behaved well. Colonel Munford's delay in coming to the field has not been satisfactorily accounted for, as the distance was not very great. General Jones' brigade had the hardest fighting, all five regiments having been engaged twice. The Twelfth Virginia Cavalry broke unnecessarily after a successful charge, which confusion entailed, as usual, harder fighting and severe loss on itself as well as on the rest of the command. Brigadier General W. H. F. Lee's brigade was handled in a handsome and highly satisfactory manner by that gallant officer, who received a severe wound through the leg in one of the last of the brilliant charges of his command on the heights. I regret very much the absence of his report, especially because his brigade being not so much under my own eye, I am unable to mention with particularity the gallantry of the officers and men of his brigade. Still more to I deplore the casualty which deprives us, for a short time only, it is hoped, of his valuable services. The command of his brigade thereafter devolved upon Colonel J. R. Chambliss, jr., Thirteenth Virginia Cavalry. The conduct of the Horse Artillery, under that daring and efficient officer,

Major R. F. Beckham, deserves the highest praise. Not one piece was ever in the hands of the enemy, through at times the can-
