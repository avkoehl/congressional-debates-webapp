THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 27,
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Has this
biSi, with the report, been printed ?
The CHAIRMAN. It has not.
Mr. WASHBURNE, oflllinois. I think these
bills and reports ought to be printed before being
acted on. I do not know but this claim is just;
but I do not think the House should act except
upon printed papers; and therefore I object.
WIDOW OF JOHN A. STEVENS.
A bill (H. R. No. 626) for the relief of the
widow and heirs of John A. Stevens, deceased,
of Springfield, Missouri.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. This bill in-
volves an important question which is now under
consideration, and I therefore object.
The CHAIRMAN. The Galendar has been
gone over once, and the Clerk will now commence
the Calendar again, and five objections will be
necessary, under the rules, lo defeat a bill.
BENJAMIN GRATZ.
A bill (H. R. No. 385) for the relief of Benja-
min Gratz. [Objected to by five members.]
HUGH LEDDY.
A bill (H. Rl No. 386) for the relief of Hugh
Leddy.
The bill and report were read.
Mr. HALE. 1 wish to say that this claim has
been indorsed by the Secretary of War and by
the Solicitor of the War Department.
The bill was objected to by five members.
Mr. HALE, if all bills are to be objected to,
without reference to their merits, there is no use
of going on.
The CHAIRMAN. Debate is not in order.
JAMES NOKES.
' A bill (H. R. No. 439) for the relief of James
Noises. [Objected to by five members.]
HEIRS OF JOHN E. BOUIJGNY.

Treasury not otherwise appropriated, §2,740 91),

Indian indemnity goods accidentally destroyed by
fire in November, 1855r while being transported
by him from St. Paul, Minnesota, to Redwood
agency, for R. G. Murphy, United States Indian

mendation that it do pass.
LOGAN IIUNTON.
Joint resolution (H. II. No. 73) for the relief of
Logan Hunton.
Mr. WILSON and four other members ob-
jected.
Mr. M ALLORY. May I be allowed to appeal
to the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Wilson] to
withdraw that objection? 1 had not supposed it
would come from a distinguished lawyer like the
gentleman from Iowa, who must know from his
own experience the propriety of making this pay-
ment.
Mr. WILSON. 1 am satisfied with the com-
pliment already paid, and must insist on my ob-
jection.
Mr. MALLORY. Then I withdraw the com-
pliment. [Laughter.]
COLUMBIA BANK.
A bill (H. R. No. 457) for the relief of the Co-
lumbia Bank. [Objected to by five members.]
Mr. HALE, i am instructed by the Commit-
tee of Claims to offer an amendment, as nn addi-
tional section to that bill, providing for the pay-
ment of the claims of other parties who suffered
losses at the same time.
By unanimous consent the amendment was re-
ceived and considered as pending.
BENJAMIN ROACII.
Joint resolution (H. R. No. 75) for the relief of

& Williams, Livingston, Kincaid & Company,
Gilbert & Gerrish, and others. [Objected to by

Mr. STEVENS. I would inquire of my col-
league if he desires to proceed any further with
this business?
Mr. HALE. I think we may as well go on.
Mr. STEVENS. 1 want to take up an appro-
priation bill.
Mr. HALE. I want to see if the House in-
tends to pass any private bills at all.
Mr. STEVENS. 1 think the gentleman must
be almost patisfied upon that point by this time.
Mr. HALE. I think they ought to be con-
sidered at all events.
Mr. STEVENS. Very well, I will not insist.

A bill (No. 463) for the relief of Ambrose Mor-
rison, of Nashville, Tennessee. [Objected to by

AMZI L, BURNES.
A bill (II. R. No. 529) for the relief of Amzi
L. Burnes. [Objected to by five members.]
Mr. HOLMAN. I hope the report will be
read in that case.
The CHAIRMAN. The report is not at the
Clerk's desk.
Mr. IIALE. I wish to state that this is abill
for the iclief of a poor man who had $550 in Uni-
ted States Treasury notes. The proof is very
satisfactory that they were burnt up when his
house was burnt, together with all he had. If
that does not give him a claim to have those notes
replaced by a just Government, I do not know
what would.
_ Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. If discus-
sion is in order, 1 will say that there was proof
equally positive that certain bonds were burnt up
on the Golden Gate, and yet' those bonds after-
ward turned up in the Department here.
Mr. HALE. These bonds never have turned
up and never will. I hold in my hand some proofs
in the case, if the gentleman will hear them read.
Mr. WASHBURNE, oflllinois. This is not
only a matter of fact, but a matter of principle.
I am opposed to this Government paying for
everything which is burnt.
Mr. IIALE. We have never objected to pay-
ing such claims where the proof was clear that
the notes had been destroyed. No honest man
and no honest Government would refuse to pay
a claim of this kind. The proof is clear that these
notes were burnt, when this man's house was
burnt, with all his property.
Mr. WASIlBURNli, of Illinois. Is discussion
in order?
The CHAIRMAN. It is not. The bill is ob-
jected to by five members.
Mr. SPALDING. I move that the committee
do now rise.
The question was taken, and no quorum vot-
ing the Chairman ordered tellers, and appointed
Messrs. Washburne, of Illinois, and Hale.
The committee divided; and the tellers reported
—ayes 28, noes 69.
So the committee refused to rise.
