Rear-Admiral DAVID D. PORTER,

Commanding Mississippi Squadron:

ADMIRAL: I have I think, sure information that light breechloading guns, about 2 1/2 pounds caliber, will be placed on the Mississippi soon. Two of them will be somewhere in the neighborhood of Austin. The shells to be used with these will be filled with Travis incendiary composition. Two horses will haul them, and they will be run from place as needed.

Your obedient servant,
