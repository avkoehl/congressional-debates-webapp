HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 2, 1864-10 a.m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

If the enemy should feel his way up near our left it is the intention of the commanding general to move out the available force on the left and the cavalry and attack. He desires, therefore, that you will remain prepared for such operation to-day until further orders. The enemy should be closely watched in that direction, and reconnaissances made by detachments from the Fifth Corps and from the cavalry to ascertain what movements, if any, he is making.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
