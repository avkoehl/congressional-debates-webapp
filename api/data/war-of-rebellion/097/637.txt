HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,Nottoway Court-House, April 7, 1865-12.30 p. m.

Major-General HARTSUFF,

Petersburg:

My order are to guard the South Side Railroad from the rear of the army back to Sutherland's Station. I do not consider that this order requires me to guard the depot at Sutherland's, and I have just learned that there are no troops there besides the guards of supply trains, which are about leaving, and the small force of mine that has been left merely as a picket guard for the railway. I would have no objection to guarding the depot had I the troops available, but having so long a lien of railway to guard I feel it incumbent upon me to request you to furnish a guard for that depot.

Major-General.

Major-General HARTSUFF,

Commanding, Petersburg:

I telegraphed you some time since about guarding the depot at Sutherland's. I hope you have made arrangements to relieve my men at that point. Please inform me whether or not you intend to relieve them; if relieved, the time of their relief, so that I can dispose of these men in accordance with my orders.

RICHMOND, April 7, 1865-2.30 p. m.

Major-General HARTSUFF,

Petersburg:

Until we get our railroad completed to you you had better send them by rail to City Point, thence by boat to this place. You had better use infantry couriers for the purpose. You will command all the forces at City Point, to which point I have ordered a brigade of 2,100 infantry. A cavalry regiment, 1,200 strong, is on the way by my order to join you at Petersburg. With these forces you can hold everything to Sutherland's Station easily, I think. I have no news.

G. WEITZEL.
