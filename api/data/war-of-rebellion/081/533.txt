requisition not already forwarded should be sent as soon as possible. It consists of about 13,000 rounds of 30-pounder Parrott, 10,000 rounds 4 1/2-inch gun, 10,000 rounds 8-inch mortar. The deficiency in the supply for the 100-pounder Parrotts, 8-inch siege howitzers, and 10-inch mortars can remain for the present unfilled, although liable at any time to be called for. I keep my train afloat until needed, so that there is no objection to having a large supply on hand.
