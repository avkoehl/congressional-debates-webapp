Jackson, Captain Goodwyn, and the various battery commanders, for their cheerful and intelligent assistance during the day.

Major White, volunteer aide to General Anderson; Captain Mills, his assistant adjutant-general; Captain Manning, aide-de-camp to the commanding general; Captain Seabrook, adjutant to the Palmetto Sharpshooters; Captain Dick, and Lieutenant De Lisle gave me efficient assistance as a staff; and I must allude here to the handsome conduct of the couriers sent me from Colonel Robertson's cavalry regiment.

The troops of this brigade, I am glad to report, [are] in a much improved condition for a fight, encouraged by the victory in which they participated, and having full trust in the generalship of their generals.

The surgical staff of the brigade attended well to their duty in very exposed positions.

When within some 200 yards of the point designated I halted the brigade, finding that the enemy had the exact range with their guns of the ground immediately in advance, firing at every horseman who made his appearance. I at once sent forward my aide (Lieutenant Pickett) to Fort Magruder to inform General Anderson of our whereabouts. His reply was he did not need any assistance at that time, and to remain in my position. Half an hour subsequently I received an order
