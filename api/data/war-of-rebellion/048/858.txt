and the men that determined bravery, which has ever made them conspicuous upon every battle-field.

Captain Boyd was severely wounded, and my sergeant-major (D. M. Layton), who has more than once been recommended for promotion, was again hurt. There was no skulking.

My thanks are due Lieutenant-Colonel Lilley and Acting Major Harper for the assistance so nobly extended me, and to Lieutenant Massie, my acting adjutant, I am especially grateful.

I herewith append a list of casualties, and additional remark that the enemy left some of their dead, knapsacks, canteens, axes, &amp;c., in our possession.

Respectfully submitted.
