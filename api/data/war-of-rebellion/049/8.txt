GENERAL: General Gordon's division, of about 4,000 men, has been ordered from the Army of the Potomac to Alexandria, to embark on steamers for Morris Island, S. C. Please have transportation ready for them. They are ordered to turn over all their land transportation to the quartermaster's department of the Army of the Potomac.

Major-General MEADE,

Army of the Potomac:

While waiting for re-enforcements from drafted men, the time should be availed of to recruit your animals;to collect all forage and provisions you can in the country, and to clean out all guerrilla bands and hostile inhabitants in the country occupied by our troops. I hope to send you by to-morrow an order in regard to transportation, based on the orders of Generals Scott, Taylor, and Wool, in Mexico, and General Grant's recent operations in Mississippi. An examination of these reports and orders prove that the transportation of the Army of the Potomac can be still further reduced to advantage. I forgot to inform you that General Griffin's resignation had been withdrawn, and its acceptance canceled.

H. W. HALLECK.

General-in-Chief.
