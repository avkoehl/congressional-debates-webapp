houses wers ruined
The catastrophe proceeded from the same causes,
and was similar m both countries, except that in
England the banks were not compelled to suspend
specie payments. The levenue of both has been
insufficient to meet the current expenses ot the Go-
vernment, and each w ill be obliged to borrow near-
ly the same sum to supply the deficiency.
This is now history, w Inch can neither be chang-
ed nor perverted. On both sides of the Atlantic all
men of business and practical statesmen have come
to the same conclusion. An ay, then, with your
Specie Cncular, your mismanagement of the depo-
sites, and your clamor raised bj the Executive
against bank notes, as the causes of the suspension
ot specie payment. The Bank calculates too
much upon the political credulity of the paople,
when, at this late day, after the subject is perfectly
understood, it attempts to palm off upon them such
exploded reasoas foi the suspension. A convul
sion which has shaken the commeicial woild to its
c ntre, and haa extended ovei three auarters of the
globe, could never spring liom such trn íal causes.
If (he Executive has been carrying on a wai
against theciedit system of the country, an 1 m fa
vor of an exclusive metallic currency tor the people
of the United States, 1 am ignoiant of the fact I
have never even su>pected it I believe this is a
mere phantom which has been conjuied up to ilarm
the feA\* ot the timid 1Í the President net should
wage my such war, I shall not fight under Ins banner
The only pretext upon which this cnaige has bien
founded is, lhat he and his political friends de ire
to sepai ate the business of the Treasury from that
ot the banks, not to rendei them hostile to each
odier Unlil that propitious day shall arnve, wc
shall be foievcr agitaled by the connection of the
currei cy with our miserable party politics Politi-
cal panics, political pressures, charges against the
Government tor exercising an improper influence
ovei the banks, and charges against the banlts for
interfering with the politic^ of the country, all, all
wh.cn have kept us in a state of constant agita-
tion for the last seven years will continue to exist,
and will be brought into action upon .eveiy succes-
sive election foi President and Vice Piesidcnt Wc
shall thus continuo in a state ol icipe,iu\l commo-

w Inch cuiil ' ue < on(( rred upon both parlies In
th s extent Í should g i w nh the President i1 I ha 1
the power, but when I deteimme to obey instruc-
tion, I balido it honestly and lauly 1 sha'l,
theref ire, say no more on this subject.
It is ¡tue that at the special session I i1 d endea-
\ci to pro"e that the present banking system, un-
dents existing regulations, ua- one ol the very
wor<t which the art of man could de\ se Under
it, ruinous exnansions and revulsions mu-i con-
tinué to succeed each oilier at stated peiiods, and
many ol tne best and most exterprising men of the
coantiy must become its victims. I ihen expressed
a hope, not unmingled with fear, that the S'ate Le-
gislatures at their next session might impose wnole-
some restrictions upon their banking institutions—
restrictions which would prove equally aelvanla-
geous to the banks and the people. These Lcgisla-
tuieshave all now usen without prescribing any
such regulations, and we are destined again and
again to pass through the same vicissitudes which
we have so often already witnessed
The Whigs have always been excerdmgly un-
lucky m regard to the time ef these periodical re-
vulsions, occasioned by excessive banking     They
have   eithei   come  too soon or too late to answei
their political purposes     Had the suspension of
specie payments occuned one year soonpr than it
did, the  hero of Tippecanoe might have been the
successor of the hero of New Orleans     But the re
vulsion came again at the wrong lime, and long
b=><bre the President!? 1 election of 1S40, th- eountiy
will again be prosperous    The effects of the sus
pension will have passed  away, like the baseless
labric of a vision, without leaving a trace behind
Ourlateexpener.ee has been so severe, that the
next bank explosion may possibly be postponed
until the yeai 1344 Whom it may then benefit I
know not, nor do I much care. One thing is cer-
tain, that these revulsions can never do any thing
but mjuiy to the party m power It is the natuie
of man to accuse the Government, or any thing
else, except his own misconduct, for his misfor-
tunes
I now approach a much more agreeable part of
mv subject, and that is, to piove lhat the banks
must and will speedily resume specie payments I
shall attempt to establish that now is the veiy time,
the accepted time, the best time, and, within the
penodot a lew months, the only time, when they
can resume, without the least embarrassment.
Some of the cuiscs which will speedily eflcct this
happy result, I shall enumerate
In the first place, I shall do the banks of the
country generally the justice to say, that since the
suspension of specie payments they have cm tailed
their cnculalioii and their loans to a great extent,
anl have done eveiy thing thev leasombly could
to atone foi then past extravagance. The bank,
ofI\nnsylvama,incIudingthat ol the United States,
dining a penod of ten months, commencing m
Januaiy, and ending in November, 1837, had le-
ducod the r cut illation horn twenty-rive millions
and a nn.mei 10 almost se ten teen millions, and
their discounts fiom eight \ -mx millions anda hall
to luaily s^veniv-one millions, whilst, dining the
san c pt nod, they hid increased their specie horn
five millions and three-qnaners to upwards ot
sevi n millions From all I can leain, they hue
been smcc progiessmg at nearly the same latí,
thoueh I have not seen their ofiiriíl nturns
The binlc ol other States have been generally pui
suing the same course The consequence is, th a
the confidence oflh< country in their binkmg insti-
tutions has bten, m .1 gieat degiec, lestoied I feel
convinced that il they should lesume specie pay-
ments to-monow, in the inteiioi ol Pennsylvania,
at least, there would be no run upon lliem, except
foi as much siUet change as might be icquired to
si pply the place ot the mis< rabie tia.h now in cn-
cuhlion lindel the denomination ol slnnplasters
Besides, tin y would s„on receive on deposite a
gnatei amount I.< m those who have been hoarding
specie, u ir'ei the Ic'icf that it would le saler at
home I'm i in the banks, and in the hope lhat they
misht lureafei use it to gieat advantage No
foici.,11 elcnia i 1 now cxiMs to dram the banks of
then specie, on the contrary, the rcfiux tide has set
m strongly, and is now uafun,' immense sums of
gold  ¡m\ silvei to out shores
But, su, anodicr powerful cause of resumption
exists Our exports of cotton have, many months
ago, pud our foreign commercial debt Whilst
th it has been extingisheel, the disastrous condition
of ourcuneicv has reduced almost to nothing the
orders of our merchants fot foieign goods Our
imports are i if small comparative v due. In the
mean time, out cotton crop of 1837 has been re-
gularly and slea lily seeking its accustomed mar-
kets in England and Prance We have sold
much, and bought little, and the balance m our
favor is nearly all returning in specie From the last
English accounts which 1 have seen, the exports
ol specie irom that country to this were still on
the increase, and now, by almest eveiy vessel
from abioad which i caches our shores, we are re-
gold and silver
Specie, by the latest ad-
vices, was the most piofiiable means of remit-
tance from England to the United States, yielding
a profit of four per cent When Congress met
in September last, the rate of Exchange against
us on England was upwards of twenty per cent.
It is now reduced to six per cent which is three or
four per cem b lovv the specie par A great re-
volution in so short a period' It proves how'tast
are the resé urces of our country
This great revolution 1 is been efiected by means
of our cotton The English manufacturers must
have to is article, or be ruined This necessity has
reversed the oidinary Iaw= ot trade, and the fo-
reign market fir it has lemamed film and steady,
although we bring home scarcely any equivalent,
except in specie.
If a laige poruon  of our cotton crop  still re-  .,
mains unsold, so much the better.   The goiden  Jj
tide w ill continue so much the longer to flow into
our country. It is the policy of our banks to take
it at the flood, and go on to foi tune. If the banks
do but seize the present golden opportunity, they
will have completely fortified themselves before a
reverse can come This state of things cannot al-
ways continue A reaction must occur If the
banks wait for the ebbmg tide, and postpone a re-
sumption until our merchants shall make heavy
purchases abroad, and specie shall begin to be ex-
ported, they will then encounter difficulties which,
they need not now dreail I again icpeat that this
moment is the accepted time for the banks to re-
sume.
But it is not only the ordinary laws of trade which
aie now bunging vast amounts of specie to our
country Two othet causes are operating power-
fully to produce this result.
The conduct of the Bank ot England, m arrest-
ing its credits to the American houses, which was
the immed ate cause of the suspension ot specie
piyments, has been loudly c mdemned by men of
all panics there This measure has done
that country neaily as much mjuiy as it has
done this, because England must always suffer
from every deiangemcnt in our cunency. The
Buik is no  conscious of this truth, and is
retiaemg her steps She has increased her stock of
bullion between Pebmary, 1S37, and March, 1838,
fiom -£-l,(H9,Ü90 to upwards of ten millions stei-
hng She is now strong, and it is her interest, as
well as that oí the people of England, that she
should use this strength in assisting us to resume
specie payments Accordingly^ she has, through
the agency ol one of our most intelligent and en-
lerr rising citizens, made an airangement to iurnish
the banks of New Yoik one million sterling m
specie, to aid them in rcstimmg piyments in gold
and silver This million is now arriving, by in-
stalments, m the -United States. In resuming at
the present moment, our banks have every tiling to
hope, and nothing to fear, fiom England
Again The spirit ol internal improvement is
abroad throughout our land Stales and private
comptnies have loans to make foi the purpose of
creeling then public works Money is now plenty
m England, and is every where seeking an invest-
ment The derangement in the business of that
country has thrown capital out oí employment.
The rate of interest has been reduced to three and
three and a half per cent Their capitalists are
anxious to make secure investments m loans to
our different State Governments, and incorporated
companies, at a higher i ate of interest than they can
obtain at home These loans are now being dispo-
sed of in England to a veiy large amount, and the
greater proportion of their proceeds must return in
specie to this country Every th ng is propitious
to an immediate resumption by our banks
Will the Bank of tuc United States resume? I
confess I do not doubt t',e fact She has made a
false movement, and it is the great prerogative of
strength to acknowledge and retieve an error. Her
late manifesto against the resumption of specie
payments has not found a single advocate on this
floor It has struck dumb all her friends. But
yesteroay she might ha"e stood against the world.
To-day there is none so poor as to do her reverence.
Even those who must politically suffer by the re-
sumption, because "it will be conclusively em-
ployed at the next elections, to show that the
schemes of the Executive are not so destructive as
they will prove heieafter," have not dared to break
a lance in her defence This was not wont to be the
case m days of yore, for hitheito her champions
have been always ready to do battle in her cause.
Notwithstanding all which has been said upon the
subject, I am not one of those who believe that the
Bank of the United States is not able to resume.
Although th  statement of her condition, as recently
published, is not very flattering, yet her resources
are vast She is able if she were willing Of this
I cannot entertain a doubt
Again Will not the Bank take compassion on
the good cily of Philadelphia, which has ever been
devoted to its niteiesf! Boston ha  been called the
Athens of America, New York, the great Com-
mercial Emporium, and Baltimore, the Monumen-
tal City, whilst Philadelphia has been distinguished
