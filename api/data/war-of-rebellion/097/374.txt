HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865-8.45 p.m.

General PARKE:

Two deserters just in from Forty-third North Carolina report that twelve miles of South Side road was destroyed; saw a dozen of Sheridan's men taken in the affair. No change in our front.

R. B. POTTER,

Brevet Major-General.

(Forwarded by Parke to Webb, 11 p.m.)

GRAVELLY RUN, March 31, 1865-1.55 a.m.

Major-General ORD,

Humphreys' Station:

The assault will not take place in the morning. Did you inflict a loss on the enemy to-day equal to your own?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

ORD'S HEADQUARTERS,

March 31, 1865-2 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I think the enemy's loss was considerable, though not as great as ours on account of nature of woods and swamps through which we approached.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

GRAVELY RUN, March 31, 1865.

Major-General ORD:

No one here has ordered your operators forward. Please order them forward at once. General Meade reports firing on Humphreys' left and left center. Hold yourself in readiness to support him in case he is attacked.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

ORD'S HEADQUARTERS,

March 31, 1865-9.30 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The enemy appear to be making an attack on my left in some force, perhaps to drive Turner and Foster from their positions near Crow's and R. Armstrong's. The Second Corps should be ready to attack on their flank promptly if necessary.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
