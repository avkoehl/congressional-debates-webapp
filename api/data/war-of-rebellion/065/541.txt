Commanding Sixth Military District:

GENERAL: I am directed to inform you, by order of the commanding general, that you must be prepared to send under a good officer the equivalent of one and a half regiments and one light battery to Second, Third, or Georgia Military Districts in case of necessity. No displacement of troops need take place at present unless urgently required for the object stated.

SAVANNAH, GA., January 23, 1864.

Major General J. F. GILMER,

Second in command, Savannah, Ga.:

GENERAL: I am informed by General Maury that the fleet of twenty-three vessels which passed Mobile Harbor on the 14th instant, going east, did not enter into Pensacola. It may be intended for Saint Mark's or mouth of the Suwannee; if so, I desire you to hold the troops lately drawn from Florida, with one battery of Georgia Light Artillery, ready to move at a moment's notice, with three of four days' provisions and a full supply of ammunition. In the event of their going, Colquitt's brigade will be ordered here from Charleston to replace them. It would be well to see that the necessary trains should be available on the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.

SAVANNAH, GA., January 23, 1864.

Keep bright lookout on coast of your district, and report immediately appearance of that fleet at any point.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
