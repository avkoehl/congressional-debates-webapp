The First and Third Divisions started at 2 p.m. in the direction of Tullahoma, camping at Crumpton's Creek, the Third Division throwing out a strong party 1/2 to 2 miles to its front toward Tullahoma.

MANCHESTER, June 29, 1863.

GENERAL: Headquarters and the Second and Fourth Divisions were moved to Crumpton's Creek, the Fourth Division camping at Concord Church, at the point where the road to Tullahoma leaves the Manchester and Winchester road. The Second Division, camped at Bobo's Cross-Roads, where the road from Tullahoma, to Hillsborough crosses the Manchester and Winchester road, General Beatty joining the Second Division at that point from Hillsborough, where he had taken position on the 28th to support Colonel Wilder in his operations against the rebels. A brigade from Third Division was thrown forward on Tullahoma road, and engaged the enemy's outposts and vedettes, driving them back toward Tullahoma, killing and wounding a good many. Colonel [James W.] Starnes, of the Confederate cavalry, reported among the killed. Our loss, 2 men slightly wounded. The road from Manchester to this point was rendered nearly impassable by one of the strongest and steadiest rains ever experienced.

Very respectfully.

HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS.

June 29, 1863-3.15 p.m.

GENERAL: General Brannan's headquarters are at the crossing of Crumpton's Creek. My headquarters will be just to the left of the crossing. General Reynolds will camp at Concord Church, three-quarters of a mile on the left of General Brannan's, Negley, at Bobo's Cross-Roads, 1 mile south of Concord Church. Have just captured a dispatch from Wheeler to [Thomas] Harrison, commanding cavalry brigade, dated 4 miles in advance of Tullahoma, on Manchester road. He directs Colonel Harrison to send a company to an intermediate position between his and Harrison's, so as to better observe the movements of the enemy (us), and to fall back as he falls back. I take it from this dispatch that they mean to draw us upon Tullahoma, so as to fight us behind their fortifications. Will make the proper disposition to drive them back as soon as General Reynolds gets into position. Our skirmishers are 2 1/2 miles from General Brannan's headquarters.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,GEO. H. THOMAS.

Major-General U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
