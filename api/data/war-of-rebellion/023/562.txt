CINCINNATI, OHIO, October 1, 1862-3.30 p.m.

Major-General HALLECK:

From information received this morning I am satisfied that Morgan is safe. He was at West Liberty on Friday last, on his way to the Ohio, via Grayson. The rebels have given up the pursuit and have returned to Mount Sterling and Paris. Reports say they are moving toward Cincinnati, but this I do not credit. I propose bringing Morgan's force here as soon as it reaches the Ohio, if there be no objection to it. It will be an important addition to our raw troops.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, OHIO, October 1, 1862-7.45 p.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

I have sent to Western Virginia the Fortieth Ohio, Eighty-fourth Indiana, and a detachment of cavalry, and General Gillmore has gone to take temporary command, but no report has yet been received from him. The total force about Point Pleasant is nearly 9,000 not including State troops, of which I have no report. I cannot safely spare from here at this time another regiment. With Kirby Smith's and Marshall's forces in front it would not be prudent to leave this place without ten or twelve regiments at least. General Morgan's command, of which I telegraphed you to-day, might be sent there, though I had designed bringing it here. Where is Milroy's brigade, which I was advised on the 26th was to be sent to Western Virginia? Nothing from General Buell or in relation to his movements. Troops come in slowly. Not a regiment has arrived for some days.

H. G. WRIGHT.
