General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE, Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Your note this instant received. I have given orders for the railroad transportation of your command. Every effort will be made to provide you with everything you need. General Bragg can hardly intend, I should think, to send Maxey's miscellaneous troops into Middle Tennessee, as they belong to regiments in Bragg's and Kirby Smith's armies. It is better that they should rejoin their regiments. I will send to Middle Tennessee immediately the new regiments in addition to the force already there. A telegram from General Slaughter, received this morning, says the enemy is reported evacuating Corinth, Bolivar, and Jackson. Not known in what direction they are going. I have no doubt if they are evacuating these places they are going to Nashville. Send to Cumberland Gap all your commissary stores not necessary to bring you to this place. You will be supplied here. It would be well that you should come in here in advance of your command. I would like much to see and confer with you.

In haste, yours, truly,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General, Commanding.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: There are many mounted troops in this department without arms. The ordnance officer of the department reported a few days since that there were in his office requisitions for 1,900 cavalry arms; that he had none to issue, and could procure none. Now that General Bragg's army is falling back from Kentucky to this line we will need all the forage that can be procured for horses tht are doing actual service. Cavalry without arms is of no service and very expensive. I recommend that all mounted troops for whom arms cannot be procured be dismounted and converted into infantry.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
