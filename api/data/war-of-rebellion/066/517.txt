HDQRS. THIRD MILITARY DIST. OF SOUTH CAROLINA,McPhersonville, June 10, 1864.

Respectfully returned.

Having very recently assumed command of this district, I must rely mainly on the reports of the officers who have from time to time inspected Company D, Fourth Florida Battalion, and who have highly commanded its drill, discipline, and apparent efficiency. A few days ago on a visit to the Combahee Ferry battery, I was most favorably impressed with the command, so far as a hurried inspection enabled me to form any opinion of its condition. Of its proficiency in heavy artillery I know little, as the opportunities for practice have been very limited.

C. J. COLCOCK,

Colonel, Commanding.

The information desired is how long Company D, Fourth Florida Battalion, has been in the Third Military District; by whose order the company was detached from its regiment, and whether there is any authority from the War Department for its detachment.

By command of Major General Samuel Jones:

H. W. FEILDEN,
