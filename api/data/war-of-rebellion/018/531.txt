HEADQUARTERS THIRD ARMY CORPS,Warrenton Springs, August 4, 1862.

Major-General POPE, Little Washington:

I learn from General King that General burnside's advance has arrived at Aquia and General Burnside himself is at Fredericksburg. I have ordered King to withdraw the troops of his division from Aquia, so that General Burnside's troops and mine may not be intermingled. I do not know that I have any cause, but still I have an apprehension that by some of the changes of the service King's division may by lost to me. I beg, therefore, to ask it may be borne in mind that this was formerly my own division, which I have formed, instructed, and disciplined, and that I should feel I received a heavy blow were I to lose it. The remaining transportation for Carroll's brigade has arrived.
