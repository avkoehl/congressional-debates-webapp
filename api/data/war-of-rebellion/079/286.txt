men. At 3 o'clock last night a brigade found the enemy still in Snake Creek Gap. Still it may be if they have seen our force they are off. If the enemy leaves us Snake Creek Gap it will not be necessary for you to pass the hill, but let us make it certain. Leave orders for your wagons to park in a convenient place, your ammunition where it can come forward on notice; move as quiet as possible for the Rome road, around by the head of Camp Creek, and let Davis close on you.

Major-General.

[General STANLEY:]

GENERAL: I got through all right. The rebs still occupy Snake Creek Gap. General Sherman wishes you to push on toward Villanow - not work down this way along the back of the mountain. Keep troops crossing toward Villanow, both Fourth and Fourteenth Corps, closing down toward the WEST end of the gap, which is about two miles from Villanow. On the map of the campaign a road is laid down from Tilton to Villanow in the very direction in which General Sherman wishes the movement made.

Respectfully, yours,

WM. H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S. -I have written at the dictation of General Sherman.
