Major R. C. DRUM,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Dept. of the Pacific, San Francisco Cal.:

MAJOR: Major Rigg, of the First California Volunteer Infantry, marched this day with four companies of that regiment for Warner's ranch. The residue of the regiment, under Colonel Carleton, will move as soon as the subsistence stores arrive which I asked for by the Senator. As soon as Major Riggs reaches Warner's ranch his train of wagons will be sent to San Diego for subsistence. I have nothing special to report to-day.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Colonel, U. S. Army, Commanding.
HDQRS. FIRST INFANTRY CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS,Camp Latham, near Los Angeles, October 10, 1861.

[Major RIGG:]

MAJOR: On your arrival at Warner's ranch, on the road toward Fort Yuma, you will select a suitable place for an encampment of four companies of infantry and immediately send off all your wagons (save two to haul wood, &amp;c.), to San Diego for subsistence stores. Your acting quartermaster will go with the train, and you will instruct him to load his wagons with rations complete (all the component parts in just proportion) and return at once to your camp. He will go down to San Diego in three days, load at night, if necessary, and return in four days. I rely upon this for my supplies. Should it so happen that before I come you should be menaced by enemies of our Government, you will be sure that the First Infantry is handsomely represented by your battalion. I have great confidence in you and the men you command. I shall doubtless arrive at Warner's ranch six days after you have gotten there.

Respectfully, &c.,

JAMES H. CARLETON,

Colonel First Infantry California Volunteers.
