His Excellency Governor ALEXANDER RAMSEY,

Saint Paul, Minn.:

DEAR SIR: Your favors of the 30th ultimo and of the 14th instant have been received and referred to the Adjutant-General for consideration. This Department is willing to accept from you a third regiment of Minnesota volunteer infantry, to be raised to the maximum of 1,046 men. Also three companies of cavalry and four companies of home guards, the latter to be organized for the special duty of garrisoning the forts of Ripley, Abercrombie, and Ridgely under your own direction. The home guards, as well as all the other troops accepted, are to be raised in accordance with he regulations appertaining to U. S. volunteer organizations. The home guards are to be organized immediately and sent to relieve the Minnesota regiment. If they cannot otherwise be furnished with arms, then the Second Minnesota Regiment is directed to turn over its arms to the home guard and receive the same number in return at Washington. The quartermaster is to be furnished immediately with sufficient clothing. The mustering officer and quartermaster are directed to confer frequently with the laws and regulations of the military service. So much of the Second Minnesota Reigment as is now at Fort Snelling, or immediately available, may be sent on at once without waiting the arrival of troops from Forts Ripley, Abercrombie, and Ridgely, if you deem it advisable so to do.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, yours,

THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Acting Secretary of War.

We understand the Fifth German Rifles (being the Forty-fifth New York Regiment, Colonel Von Amsberg) will be ready to lave New York on 25th. They are intended for General Blenker's brigade. Send them direct to Washington.

THOMAS A. SCOTT.
