I cannot refrain from bringing to the notice of the general commanding the unfailing alacrity and cheerfulness with which both officers and men bore the labors and privations of this severe march, and this, with its unflinching courage in battle, leads me to express the encomium that it is a division which may be relied upon in any and every emergency.

Respectfully submitted.

C. S. HAMILTON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Third Division.

Lieutenant Colonel H. G. KENNETT, Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Corinth, October 3, 1862.

Brigadier General C. S. HAMILTON,

Commanding Third Division:

C. GODDARD,

First Lieutenant, Twelfth Inft., Ohio Vols., Actg. Asst. Adjt. General

P. S.- You may perhaps have to move farther out, as Davies does not find good ground until he gets near the old rebel works, and he proposes to swing his right still further around.

General HAMILTON:

For fear of a misunderstanding in relation to my orders I wish it distinctly understood that the extreme position is not to be taken until driven to it.

By order of Major-General Rosecrans:

S. C. LYFORD,

Acting Aide-de-Camp.

GENERAL: The general commanding desires me to say to you not to be in a hurry to show yourself. Keep well covered and conceal your strength. The enemy will doubtless feel your position, but do not allow this to hasten your movements.

S. C. LYFORD,

Acting Aide-de-Camp.
