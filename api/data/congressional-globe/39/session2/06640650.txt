treasury notes.
The SPEAKER, by unanimous consent, laid
before the House a communication from the
Secretary of the Treasury, transmitting inform-
ation required by the second section of the act
of April 12, 1861; which was referred to the
Committee of Ways and Means, and ordered
to be printed.

The SPEAKER also laid before the House
a communication from the Secretary of the
Treasury, in answer to a resolution of the
House of the 3d instant, transmitting reports
relative to the loss of the steamer Evening Star
and the wreck of the steamer Commodore;
which was ordered to be printed, and referred

leave of absence.
Mr. MOORHEAD asked and obtained leave
of absence for Mr. Culver for ten days,
oaths for attorneys—again.
The SPEAKER. The pending question is
on the motion to adjourn.
Mr. LE BLOND. I move that when the
House adjourns it adjourn to meet on Thurs-
day next.
The SPEAKER. That motion is not in
order. The motion to fix a time for adjourn-
ment has priority over a mere motion to ad-
journ, but the usage has been in all recent
Congresses that the former motion cannot be
repeated, after being once decided, until the
motion to adjourn has been decided, and for
this reason: that one fifth of the members of
the^ House could keep it in session when a
majority desired it to adjourn.
Mr. LE BLOND. Then I move that the
House take a recess until half past seven
o'clock.
The SPEAKER. That does not take prece-
dence; the motion to adjourn must be put
before any other motion of a similar character
is put.^
Mr. BOUTWELL. I wish to inquire what
will be the state of this bill if the House
adjourns.
The SPEAKER. It will come up to-mor-
row morning immediately after the reading of
the Journal.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I ask unanimous con-
sent to introduce a resolution.
Mr. RADFORD. I object.
The question being taken on the motion to
adjourn, it was decided in the negative—yeas •

So the motion to adjourn was disagreed to.
Mr. KASSON. I ask the consent of the

charge of this bill, that instead of adjourning
