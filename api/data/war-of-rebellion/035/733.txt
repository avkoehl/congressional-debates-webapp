of his successful expedition were the capture of 750 privates and 35 commissioned officers, with all their arms, accouterments, ammunition, and 16 wagons and teams. The troops here captured constituted the remainder of the brigade so successfully attacked by Major-General Van Dorn on the 5th instant.

The skillful manner in which these generals achieved their success exhibits clearly the judgment and gallantry which animated them, and the discipline and good conduct of the brave troops of their commands. Such signal examples of duty the general commanding takes pleasure in commending. They are worthy of imitation by all commands, and deserve the applause and gratitude of their comrades in arms and their country.

By command of General Bragg:
