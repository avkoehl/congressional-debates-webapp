A single peak held by a regiment becomes a key to the whole range. I wish you to calculate to have ten days' supplies and to send your wagons to the rear, not to come up till the time expires or your order them.

I have a note from Schofield, who says that one brigade of Stoneman got to Cleveland to-day and another will to-morrow, so that we may not be able to put our project in operation by the day after to-morrow, but we will get all ready.

We can give you supplies here. If you think it practicable you may order Kilpatrick to make a strike at the railroad. If Johnston passes down can't you hit him in flank, or has he too many roads? Cant' you get a road or find a way from the mouth of the valley across three or four miles north of Resaca? Do you think Johnston has yet discovered the nature of your force?

Write me fully.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
