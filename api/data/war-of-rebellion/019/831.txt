PRICEVILLE, MISS., June 9, 1862.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT:

DEAR GENERAL: The movements of the army from Corinth to Tupelo and this place have occupied my attention so exclusively that I have found it impossible until to-day to answer your letter in regard to Governor Rector's proclamation. Before doing so now I must express to you my appreciation of your kindness in making me suggestions as to the propriety of making a reply to the people of the Trans-Mississippi District on the subject of that proclamation. I had previously thought of replying to Governor Rector, but found upon diligent inquiry that his people indignantly repudiated his pernicious opinions and that he stood almost alone with them. I had concluded therefore to act in the matter by sending some one to Arkansas in my stead during my absence to organize the troops from Arkansas, Texas, and Missouri already assembling there in considerable force, and to put them in the field against the common enemy. This I conceived would be a sufficient antidote
