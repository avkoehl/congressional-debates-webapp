The second one, though less fall, contains some
striking evidence on the comparative and very dif-
ferent ability to sustain specie payments m different

I exertions which have been made to resume them
I From us contents, the unreasonableness mentioned

I pecting the exertions of many, and the duties ot
| the whole, to wait in these respects on the means

I     These íetums exhibit some improvement in the

I of much of the currency     But they furnish at the

active  circulation, had not at their dates, equalled

this Department would be inquired to restore the p i-
  per currency generally to a safe basis, and make it
, with the specie m actual use, hear a just propor-
tion to the leal wants of the community     But the
J continued íeduction in circulation and deposites
J which, since August, has probably been persisted in
| by several of the banks, must, if effected in the
I most judicious course,  by a curtailment of  then
* discounts, have served, by this ttme, to place those
J ms'itutions in a more eligible condition to resume
J specie payments     Where this ¡eduction has been
5 accompanied by any constdeiablc inetease lather
than diminution ot specie, the ability to resume,
and with  proper lestnctions and care hereafter to
' sustain, specie pavments must approach veiy n^ai
the  point rcquis te  to  insure   public  confidence
Because the  rait ot foreign exchange Ins been so
fai   reduced, as to be neai the real par in specie,
and seldom to permit the export of it t > advintage,
and the liabilities cf the banks to the Government,
which otherwise might piess upon them in case of
a resumption, aie in mosteases  cither discharged,
or in a tiam of postponement, or uiconsideiable m
amount
The recent imports and exports of specie have
an impoitant bearing in forming a coirtct opinion
on these questions The imports appearing on the
custom-house books have, during the year ending
September 30, 1837, bepn ascertained by the
weekly returns to be $10,954,'532 while the ex-
ports during the same peuod have been only
$6,714,990 Other i tuins, when all leccived,
may slightly diffi r Undoubtedly the whole actual
imports and exports, whether on the books, or not,
have exceeded these amounts, ind though the ex-
cess has probibly been greater on the part oí the
exports, vet these last cannot safely be computed
to have gone beyond the lrnpotts
The invariable laws that govern trade and the
curienoy have thus indicated a healthier condition
oí  our system than would otherwise be mftiied
from the genend and proti acted suspension oí spe-
cie p lyments by most of the banking institutions
The addition of about fort) five millions of spe-
cie, winch, within four years past, has been  made
to the quantity tnat was btfote in the United States
may have enabled persons to increase binK capital
and bank issues in place* wheio the restrictions on
the latter weie loose     But that the naiuial ten-
dency oí  Jt, as supposed  by some, has been to
derange the currency,  as well as the commerce,
not only  of these Slates,  but of Enipe, is an
opinion that cannot have much foundattm m a íy
safe principle of political economy when u is con-
sidered  that the currency of Europe, in saecie
alonp, is computed to exceed eleven hundred mil-
lions ol dol'ars, and of the world, to be nearly
two thousand millions, and us go'd and silver, in
various uses, to equa1 from five to seven thousand
millions.    It is woithv <f notice, also,  that the
addition of specie above mentnned, though laige
compared with the amount previously possessed,
has hardly equalled the nett profits on the si gW
article of cotton shipped from this country m the
years 1835 and '36

The latter course is the only one, which dtitin^ the
prese it suspension it has ypt appeared proper to
adopt In ptu mce of it, the mode of making
most of the pub' c payments since May last, the
manner in which the July instalment was p'aced

3 ear ínpayinc t le fourth one, giving theteby a tem-
porary a d, as substantial to several of the banks as
to theTieasury, and the liberal indulgence offered
to them, for the balances still due to the United
States, were all measures of relief, and ha\ e contri-
buted to strengthen their immediate means for the
lesumption of specie payments Beiond such in-
cidental aid to som  oí the banks, with which may
have existed fiscal connections, not generally equil-

chief nil mce ol banks to perform their legal obli-

and whv tne exclusive use of com for all kinds of
payments cou'd not at present be introduttd, and

with whatever limitations as to time or amount,
care must be exercised to adhere to the sp rit of
