Tffift COM"GRSESION AL GLOB!.
May 10,
of the pork had received but Mee* dollars for
duties for the past twelve mouths, and that thfe
town lots were gradually being appropriated tt>
the cultivation of sugar-cone. Lahaina is noth-
ing but a sale roadstead. Formerly, when the
pilotage, harbor dues. «S:o., at Houolulu were
very high, nearly all our whale ships, to save
expense, anchored at and obtained their sup-
plies there. Now, under the reduced port
charges at Honolulu, they prefer that secure
harbor, and Lahaina is rapidly going to decay.
In ray judgment the appropriation for the com
sul at that place ought to be strack out of the
bill; and I intend to make that motion at the
proper time.
There are many consulates that ought to be
continued, although the fees collected pay but
a small part of the expense of maintaining
them, because they are situated in remote parts
of the world where it ia necessary to hare some
kind of a representative of our Government
to protect the rights of our oitineas.
At the end of the forty-fourth line I shall,
at the proper time, offer as an amendment the
following proviso:
That preper voochfeM eh H hereafter
in *11 eases be presented to the proper aocountiw
officer of the Treasury for any and all expunditures
of money hereby appropriated: and the certificate
of the Prerident shall not la any ease bo deemed a
and object of makin;
statement  hi"
shall order it.
As the objeot of this proviso may not be
apparent to all, I trust I shall be pardoned if
I occupy yonr time a few moments in explain*
ing it, and showing the propriety of putting it
in this bill in connection with this appropria*
tion. It is well known that from a very early
period of our national existence menoy has
annually been appropriated for the contingent
expenses of foreign intercourse, any part of
which might be expended under the direction
or with the assent of the President, without
any account being rendered of the qtapner^
purpose, or object of such expenditure. If
the President ''approvod" the expenditure,
and gave his certificate of that feet, it ended all
inquiry. This practice was supposed to be
necessary in carrying on our intercourse with
other Governments, to obtain early and correct
information as to what they intended to do in
cases where the interests of this oquntrjf were
involved; and of course the money that could
not be openly accounted foe must have been
paid to spies and informers. The information
obtained from snch aouroea in time of peace
cannot be very reliable or very valuable. It
might be worth more in time of war, when .the
spy would occasionally be in the power ef the
party to whom he furnished information, and
there may be some excuse and perhaps anecM->
sity for appropriating money for secret service
at such times, but none for keeping up the
practice in time of peace, •
Besides, sir, the practice is liable to great
abuse. The people havea sight to know what
their public servants do with alt the money in-
trusted to them; and they will not and ought not
to be satisfied with beieg told that their money
has been expended with the approval of any
one of their servants, no matter how great may
be their confidence in him. Such a practice is
inconsistent with the idea of the responsibility
of every officer of our Government, and ought
to be stopped at oncei
I hare taken the trouble to snake some invest-
igations into the expenditure of What is gen-
erally known as the secret-service fund of the
Government for the last few years. There is
no such fund known to onr laws, and no appro
priation is ever made, for any secret service by
that name. The secret-service money comes
from the appropriatiobs.for "contingent ex-
penses of foreign intercourse.'1 -Prior to the
year 1836 the expenditure of money for secret
service setms to liave rested upon usage onlyj
but in that fear a law was enacted authorizing
the expenditure of money appropriated for the
projor voucher unless the same shall h« aoeompa-
of making s
statement shall not be published unless Congress
bya full and accurate statement (>f the purpose
oh expenditure, but such
contingent expenses of foreign intercourse to
ba settled at the Treasury, upon this oertifioato
of the President that he approved Buch ex-
penditure. It is drawn from the Treasury, I
presume, in the usual way, by a requisition from
the State Department. It is accounted for by
such a paper as I now send to the Clerk's desk
to be read.
The Clerk read as follows i
Satisfactory evidenoe having heeaproduoed to mo
that Qeorpre E. Baker, agent, has paid tho Sum of
$106,610 0!)during thesix months epding Deoembor31,
1866, from tho funds for tho contingent expenses of
foreign intercourse, the ohleets of which it is inex-
pedient now to be made known, I hereby authorlzo
ajsd direct the accounting ofiioer of the Treasury in
tho settlement of the accounts of the said George M.
Baker, agent, to allow hirtt a erotlit for tho amount
above stated.
ANDREW JOHNSON.
Approved: WILLIAM II. SEWARD.
Washington, January $, 1867.
Mr. KEL8EY. That paper, sir, is a copy
of a voucher on file in the Treasury Depart-
ment. You will Observe that it bears date on
the 8th day of January, 1867, and reeites that—*
" Satisfactory evtdMtoe having been produced ts
me (Andrew Johnson) that George K, Baker, atfenb
has paid tho sum of8106,610 09 during tho six mouths
ending December SI, I860, from the funds for thA con-
tingent expenses of ibreigR interoonrse, the objects
of which it<ia inexpedient no* to bo made known,
I hereby authorize and direct," &c.
When I first read this document I supposed
I had found out how the expenses of that re-
markable pilgrimage known as('swinging round
tho circle" were paid, and I am not certain yet
but that a part of this sum Was so disposed of.
But on further examination I found that on the
23d of February, 1869, certainly two years and
about two months, and possibly two years and
about eight months after this money was drawA
from the Treasury., $98,280 of this money whs
paid back into the Treasury. This money was
drawn in coin and paid back in coin. Jitr.
Johnson certified on tho 8th of January, 18G7. j
that satisfactory evidence had been produce^ i
to him that the money had been, expended.
What for ? That we are not permitted to know.
But why was a part of it paid back? And
what became of the $8,330 (fa in coin that was
not paid back? Where was this large sum of
$98,280 in coin during jsiore than two years
and a half that it was not in the Treasury ?
If it was safely invested during this time iti
United States bonds, of it. might hate been,
somebody must have receipted mote (h^n fifteen
thousand dollars in interest upon it. ' ;
But; Sir, there Were some further peculiars
tieb attending this very peculiar transaction. It
Reams the mohey pAid back was deposited with
the Treasurer of' the United States at Wash-
ington on the 23d day of February, 1809, to the
personal credit of Mr. Baker, the agent; that
on the (5th of March following it was covered
into the Treasury by warrant. I will thnnk
the Clerk to read the warrant, a copy of which
I send to the desk, and the indorsements and
ordeta bf the Comptroller on the face of it.
The Clerk read as follows :
To George E. Bakek,
DMursing Vlcrk, State Department :
At sight will pay to tho Treasurer of tho United
States or order, for the uso of said States, f 98,280, on
account of moneys heretofore roceived by you, and
for so doing this shall bcyour warrant.
