BALTIMORE, MD., July 7, 1864.

Captain GILMAN,

Commissary of Subsistence:

CAPTAIN: Are you aware that a division of troops from the Army of the Potomac are here and arriving to-night and are to proceed to the Monocacy? I have no instructions about the probable wants of said command as to subsistence. I presume you have received instructions, but thought best to inform you and ask a reply, inasmuch as they are being sent forward as fast as they arrive. All of the troops thus far sent to the Monocacy have taken three days' rations. I am not aware that there are any other stores at that point.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAML. B. LAWRENCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
