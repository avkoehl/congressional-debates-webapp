measure is to increase the quantity of gold and «i -
ver, aDd afford us a m re permanent medium of
exchange, not uubject to the fluctuations wlvch
hive some imes been so sudden as lo put all rea-
sonable calculation at defiance, and involve many
in remediless rum.
But where is this additional gold and silver to
come from? The mines in this country will «ot
produce it; and, if we receive it at all, it must be
in exchange for our commodities from ihose loun-
tnes with which we principally trade. The great
staples of the South, particularly cotton, depend
principally upon foreign marke's for demand, and
■we cannot adopt a course better calculated to
check its consumption, and consequently to reduce
its price, than to abstract the precidus me'als to an
inconvenient extent from those countries with
which we principally tiade, and thus dimim«h
then ability to consume it, for manufactures can-
not flourish without a redundant capital.
The recent commercial history of this country
and of England affords ample illustration of the
position which I have laid down; for, let us differ
as we may as to the ultimate causes of the great
revulsion of 1837, we must all admit that the seve-
rity of the blow was increased by the disturbance
which had taken place in the tquilibnum of the
precious metals. More having been attracted
from our principal customer, England, than she
could conveniently spare, her bank commenced a
system of severe restricticn, which produced an
immediate effect upon the demand for our cotton,
and in eight short weeks brought down the price ot
tiis great stapl*, which constituted one of the
principal rounds in that ladder by which the whole
country had risen in commercial prospfrily, from
15 and 16 and 17, to 8 and 9 and 10 cents per
pound
That the sudden reduction which occurrtd in
the price ol cotton is mainly to be attributed io thi,
cu'-p, and not, as sonic have suppjved, to over-
produc'ton, I think is suscep ible ot demonstration
F c m 1833 to 1837, ct U( n was in ac'ive ('eimnd,
at generally increasing prices During that timej
its pitducton was mcrea ed toan almost incredi-
V enteit, but the demand kept even pace with the
p're"iicn n til increasing prices—not from specu-
L'tiui,, but because consumption was equal to the
pioduction. If gentlemen want proof, let ibem
referió the commercial statistics of this louatry
and of England
Fitc trade disdains lo be fettered, even  with
£ olden Cham-.   And if the precious mi uls -ire ] ft
without the regulation of law, to diffuse tbun hv>-
according to ihe wants of c inine e —it in    tariff
is permitted to lemam at arard r He revenu  wan
dard, and  the duties to be paid in a medium con-
venient  to our merchant*, so lhat the pro 'uotionc
of other counlms may  be freely exchamed  fir
ours, we have not  much  to fear (rom the over
production   of  cotton,   which   has   now   nearly
reached its maximum, at home, or from compeli-
t on abroad
In support of this opinion,! will say thit ihe
consumption of cotton may be much increased
perhaps doubled, in the United Stales but ifEu'
rope alone should consume, in proportion lo her
population, only as much as is now consumid in
this country, her consumption wouid nearly double
the average product of the TJniled Stat Wl are
not, however, the only producéis of this srticle
Partial supplies are furnished by E ypt, the Ei t
Indies and South America; but we are i en/, and,
notwithstanding the efforts of Great Britain 'o ex'
tend its cultivation in her E^st India po sessions
will, fiom the nature of our insi tutions, continue,
with Texas and the Brazils, to ba th- princinai
p-oducers for the consumption of the wh le world
least of all have we to fear ih« competition of the
ifldo'entEast Indian, although be live;, upon a soil
where cotton is indigenous, and where it ha., been
known for more than two thousand year 
If the celebrated specie circular, issued during
the last term of General Jackson's adminis ration,
produced derangement m the crculation—and for
this we have not only the high autbon'y of Presi-
dent Tyler, m his message at the commencement
of the present Congress, but the still higher autho-
rity of experience—how is it possible that a mea-
sure, which requires not (hat the public lands only,
hut m^t a I the publ.c d je=, shall, af er a certain
time, be paid for exclusively in gold and silver,
cmpiove a barm'e-s mfa-ure? Attempt, sir, no
quackery. Leave 'he , rcuous mcials to regulate
themselvi s according to thi" requirements of trade,
and we wi 1 no doubt generally have out duf pro-
portion All that we want is eneugh to form the
basis of a sound circulation.
It has been the habit of this Government to con-
sult the convenience of the tax payer in the collec-
tion of its due", and to receive them ei'her in spe-
cie or in the no'es of specie-paring banks, conver-
tible into specie on demand Why not continue so
to receive them? Undei this sys em, we flourished
lo a remarkable degtee; so much «o, that thp
brightest page in the annals of human history is
that which records the advance of this self-
governed people to their elevated pos tion among
the commercial nations of the eartb, under the
fullest development of the credit system lhat has
ever existed among men
Shall we run the risk of checking this prosperi-
ty, because, forsooth, the Govt rnment miy occa-
sionally lose a few dollars by the depreciation of
bank notes? But even of this, the probability is
very remote; and, id proof of this opinion, I will
refer to House document No. 10, of the first ses-
sion of the Twenty-sixth Congress, being a report
of the Secretary ot the Treasuty, in answer to a
resolution of the House of Representa ives, con-
taining, among other thing-, a statement of
moneys expended and losses sustained under
e^ch administration, from 1789 to 1836, in-
clusive From this document, it appears lhat,
from 1821 to 1836, both inclusive, embra -
in  a period of sixteen years, during ih° who' 
of w'ueh time the 3 >mt ice lution ->f 1816,
antoi- 7ing either sieue or .he ne te* of specie piy-
mi« i\iU* tobe reieivtd in payment of pubhedues,
w 1- m full o¡ «ration, except so far us lim ted by
T ,*sH'v circular of ISif>, and during i-hiohtttne
the r olsiitothe Treasury exceeded the receipt 
of any other equal peno I of our history, it is not
ascertained lhat a tingle cent was lost by the depre-
ciation <J bank notes. "" Let it also be r< membered
lhat, for a part of this time, the United StaUs Bank
was in no way the fiscal agent of the Government,
that fluctuations in tiade were unusually great, and
that the le^al organ zation of the Treasury Depart-
ment was very imperfect Have we any reason
to believe ih t, with such iddittonal prisas may
beimpo'ed upon the Fieasury, we will noi be
equally fortunate for the tune to c<m<?
What shall be those guards?    First—I propose
to make it ihe duty of ihe Secntarv of the Treasu-
ry 10 have 'ettlements with the banks fi r   all  ba
lancet of their no es that mav i* main in the Trea
sury, at least once m mnei¥ JayS,
I am aware that it may be thrugh' lhat a rigid
requirement upon the banks to setile up periodical-
ly with ihe Treasury, would have a  bad an effect
upon their <-ireulation as the rrqunement orgeld
and si'ver exclusively m payment of the public
does But that such won d not be the case, I will
mw pio<eed 'o illustrate by a single example The
Western gentlemen at le 1st know, that whenevtr
there is an aettv  demand for lands, the public
land salts are attended by thousand- ef individu-
als with a view of purchasing, if th y can obtain
lands which ilvv dcsiie at pnces that they art wil
ling to give E(chone of ih-se peisons, to e m-
bie him to purcha' , must be -upplt^d wnh ih>
med um that the Goeeri men' is wi lirg to rece ve
to wit gold -ind stiver on y This gold pnj silver
must bt obtained prucipahy from specie p?ytn 
banks, in exchange for the r notes in circulation!
Now, observe the operatitn Oí every thousand
persons who an nd the land sales, wi h their sad-
dle-bag^ load d with specie, not more, peihjps
than a hundred will ac ually purchase, and not
more than one dollar outofevery ten that is diasn
from the bank- in «pec e may be actually required
Thus y~,\x see hjw, under the operation of this
measure, ti e banks in the neighborhood of land
sales may be compelled, upon their approach, with
a due regard to their own preservation, either to
curtail their circulation to an extent that may te
ruinous to the community, or to suspend specie
payments. On the other hand, if you allow the
notes uf specie p ying banks to be received in pay-
ment of the public dues, and require a se tlement
with them forthwith, the demand upen !hem will
onty be cormnen.urate vv th the amoni  of their
n< tes actually naid into the Treasury. If instead,
however, of requiring them to jredeem their notes
with specie immediately, we were to do so at m
tervals of «inety days, a large amount of their
notes would be paia out to ct editors willing to re-
ceive them m the intermediate time, and the ba-
lances remaining to be settled for in specs would
generally be very inconsiderable
It appears to me, b/ a regulation of this sort,
that all trr proper comedión between the Govern-
ment and the banks would be avoided—that the
danger of loss to the Government would be too in-
considerable to be worthy of consideration in the
decision of a subject upon which such great inle-
res's depend—that the convenience of the tax-payer
would be consulted—'hat irade would flourish__
the Government, by its fiscal action, neither inter-
fering lo stimulate nor to restiain it, but receiving
the notes of specie-paying banks—not with a view
to the interests of stockholders or corporatiens, but
with a view to the convenience of the community
at large—allowing to us officers the same right to
reject the notes of a doubtful bank that any mdi
vidual has in ihe management of his own affairs
I know it may be urged that to allow to the
officers of the Treasury the power of discriminating
between the rte- of d fferent ba' k«, would give
them great opportunities of exercising undue fa-
voritism The objection, if true, is of too little
importance to írfluence the decision of a question
involving, perhaps, the interests ot trade and the
prosperity of commtrce The objection 1 , how-
ever, more specious, than real, for, if the enVers
of the Trea ury were to receive the notes of paiticu-
lar banks ami rtfuse these of others of equal
standing, where all were equally current, the par-
tiality would beso raanilest that they wiuld be
overwhelmed by a s'orm t f.publtc indignation
1 do not design to interfere wi h the exiting law
further than to auttionz' the Government dues to
be eolh cted in confoimity with the jo nt resolution
of 1816, and, as a necessary consequence, to re-
peal that provision which makes it the dutyef
every efficer or agent of ihe Govetnmert, after trie
30 h June, 1843, engaged in making disbms merits
on ccount of ihe United States, or of ihe General
Post Office, to make all payme its in gold and sti-
ver 0 ly I do nut propose t > allow the arm of
the Government 10 be used citner for the purpose
of stimulating or restraining speculation Tne
enterpn-e of the couniry ihould be left unfet-
ered, its mdu tiy should be prjtected, but not
regulated
To allow tne Government money to be used for
banking purposes, or for any oij°cts of private
speculat on, as was the case buth under the dynas-
ty of ihe United Stales B<u k and under the pet
bank deposite «ys em, is 10  apply   them  to   pur-
po es   not con emp aled   in   the d nslitution__to
purpose  for which taxes never can be legitimately
collec ed
Tne unequal fiscal opera'nn of this Government
has hitherto arisen, not s> much from inequali íes
m the collection and disbuisement of tht pubic
revenue up n public ohj'ei-, as applied to different
sections of ihe country, a lrom having allowed
the pub 1 fund- to be used for purposes of
private -pecula n n Thus, supp «e by way of i!
lustration, that %2 000 000 are deposited m the
bank- tf one S a e, and that orly ¿50,000 are de-
posited in th^ b..nks of anoih^r, with the same
privilege ot using v for commercial purposes until
wanted b, the Government, is it not ooyious that
the (ommercialfat; lilies of that Stat^ where the
§2,000 000 a'e deposited will be promoted just
forty times as much by th-op ration, as of Uat
State wh>re only $50 000 ar*  deposited? Theme
quality, urder such a sys em, will frequently be
much greater even than tnts
Another evil of the geneial deposite system is,
that the stocl< holders of the banks with whom the
public deposites are made, are immediately %rmed
into an organized" corps in favor of high taxation.
To effect the same object, their debtors would soon
