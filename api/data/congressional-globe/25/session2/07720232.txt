APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GOLBE.
Mar.  183&
25th Cow  2\"d Sfss
Making public officers depositaries—Mr, J fall.
Senate.
the same reason apply against a delegation to State
banks as a United States Bank?
The honorable Senator, after all, if he has been
successful, has only proved that Congress has pow-
er to create a Government bank, that monster that
has so horribly affrighted gentlemen in the Opposi-
tion, he has only proved that Congress has power
to create a people's bank, with the people's monev,
and for the people's use, and tobe controlled bj the
officers of the people, chosen agreeably to the Con-
stitution.
When the honorable Senator finds the consti-
tutional power in Congress to regulate the curren-
cy, he has no' advanced one step in hi  argument
He must still prove that Congress can delegate that
eminent preiogative of sovereignty to corporations
unknown to the Constitution—that we can with-
draw ourselves from our con«ti uttonal d ity, and
substitute corporations to discharge it
Sir, we can have no more right to create corpo-
rations to carry into execution implied power*, than
express powers We have authority to com
money, regulate the value thereof, to regálate com-
merce, declare war, etc Must we not exercise
those powers ourselves? Can ue create apuvate
corporation to com money, icgulate commerce, de-
clare war, etc 1 Can we, under the ccpreks .ml
implied powers granted by the Consti ution shiii;>lt
over the States with corporations to can y on
mining, the manufacture of metals, o raise pio-
ducts, build ships, and lor mechanical, manulac
turing, and agucultura! purposes' The mantle ol
construction ot the honorable Senator is broul
enough to co\ ei the whole How does he escape
from thi'i By setbig a distinction vthidi t> a
ptíilto p> incipn, a mere begging ot the question
But, sir, 1 do not mean to give my opinion on
this subject It is full oí interest, and dt sines a
calm, unbiassed and unrestrained consideration
am not at liberty to give it that consult ration
Upon this subject I have been instructed both by
the people and the Legislatuie of the State which I
have the honor m part to represent, m every way
that the voice of the people of New Jeisey could he
constitutionally declared, to vote against any Bmk
of the United States, such as proposed by the <-e
nator
1. The people settled it on the rc-elet i n oi
General Jackson
2 It was sutled by the Whig Li^islatuu uf
1832, m their abortive (ilort to instinct
.i It was settled by thi voice oí the peoph , n
the election ot the members of Congress in 1832
4    It was a firmed by the people, m tin election
of State otlicersm 18. 
5    It was declared expressly by the mstiuctioas
of the Legislature in 1834
6    It was again affirmed by the State elections
and the election of members of Congress in 18 !4
7    It was again affirmed by the election ol the
members of the State Legislature in 1>W, with
express reference to the election of a Seiiatoi
8    It was settled both by the pe< pie ai d the I.
g.slature in electing me a- S. n itoi
0 It was again affirmed by tht Ltd sl.ume in
plain and explicit terms in the in mictions oi
1835
Andwlat can be "d ancod to „ unsay this ai-
ray of facts' Notnuic, sir, but the election of
eleci irs and membeis of Congress oppo, .l to the
present Administration in 1836, and the < I-< inn
and icsolutions of the present Legislature Xow
as to the first, the election oí membeis of Ct i gres
the only one of the electe' membei s wl o ex noised
any opinion on the subject [Mr Husriunl was
compelled by the pressure ot public op  ion to
give a written p'edge, that, if electe 1 he would
vote against a Bank ot the United State* I know,
sir, that he has since voted diflerently, an I told his
constituents that there was anessentrl difference
between the Bank of the United States and a Bank
of the United States that he meant to \ ce against
the former, not the latter Whether ho has "pal-
tered with them in a double sense,".t is not for me
to determine—and he wilt soon be before, the
tribunal that has ample junsdic ion *o d termine
This pledge takes away any impliiatnn that the
people had changed, and indeed strongly con turns
the former decisions on this subject.   The candi-
date who made this pledge was the highest on the
return As to the electoral election ui New Jei-
sey, many extraneous reuuiers were throvs n in, and
the majority was tailing. The majouty was acci-
dental, and could not repeal a settled uniform opi-
nion so frequently declared and expressed dueclly
by the people and the Legislates
As to tha last election, and the resolution of the
piesent Legislatuie, they are silent on the subject
of the bank They leave the former mslnictions
of the Legislature, on the subject of the bank, un-
lepealed, and in full fniee But, sir, m thi«¡ last
election the great question about the banks came
daectly before the people. Tha banks had become
dependent on the peoplr bj their suspension The
banks- and then numerous stockholder and depen-
dents had a deep inteiest m the choice of those who
were to dec ide their (ate The i a« -head-and-bloo-
d)-hornso' Lei o IWoism and Democracy vteie

p'e of New Jersev t-je has declared that they
want onl\ the little word instruct, to be instructions.
I b id borne tbeallnstons of the (lisunsuished Sena-
to f on hi mucky, and the other Senators acting
vit  bun in support ot toe antagonistical polio),
with the most eiemplary forbearance The course
of my colleague demands that I should ask the in-
dulgence of the Senate jvhile \ recount to them the
rise and progress of the doctrine of instruction in
New Jersey. It will be found sufficiently curious
to reward their attention. Sir, the Legislature of
New Jersey have always been an instructing Le-
gislature.   It was so up to 1832.
On the 29th October, 183S, my colleagae, then
Governor of New Jersey, delivered an inaugural
address Among other things he took occasion to
say
' 1 he people of New Jeisey have two Governments equally
ihmiown equally bound to pioiect iheir rights and interests,
unl they have divided the powers uflegtstaiion and sovereignty
between them and they have set limits to these powers mhotli

These icsolutions, however, were never finally
acted on by the Council, and they perished between
the two hou-es But while these instructions were
pending before the Council, Governor Southard
sent a message, on the 10th of January, 1833, to
the Legislative, irom which I ask leave to read
some exuacta

The Governor ilien communtcates those interests
They aie, the judiciary, the tariff system, internal
improvements, and the currency of the country,

msti uc nons then pending before the Council. He

Mycolhague ceased to be Governor, and be-
came a Senatoi Benedict, when he was accused
of having railed against matrimony, defended him-
se'f, by saymf, that he then did not believe that he
should ever live to be married So mj colleagae
has reason to sat, that when he recommended m-
stmetions for others, be did not believe that he
shou'l ever live to be instructed. Even-handed
justice returned the chalice to his own lips.
On the 11th of January, 1834, the Legislature
