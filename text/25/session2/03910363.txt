TREASURY NOTES
On motion of Mr. CAMBRELENG, the com-
mittee took up the following bill
A BILL to carry mto effect an act approvt d the
twelfth day  of   October, eighteen hundred and
thirty-seven,  "to authorise the issuing of Trea-
sury notes "
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rekrc
sentatives of the United States of Jlmenca in Congiess
assembled, That the Secietarj of the Treasuiy, with
the approbation of the President of the United
States, is hereby authorized to cause Treasuiy
notes to be issued, according to the prov sions of
an act entitled "An act to authorize the issuing of
Treasuiy notes," approved the twelfth day of Octo
ber last, in plate of such notes as have been, or
may be, issued und< r the authority of the act
aforesaid, and which have been, or may heieafter
be, paid mto the Treasury and caneellec'
Mr. CAMBRELENG congratulated the commit-
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
tee on the resumption of its labors after so long an
mtenal The delay was unfortunate It had been
not only embairassing to the Treasury, but highlj
injurious to the public creditors, and to all in anv
manner connected with the public service It is
an extraordinary occurrence, that a Government,
whose actual resources, in proportion to its annual
receipts and expenditures, were more ample than
those of any other Government, should, b} mere
delay m legislation, be unable to discharge its
obligations for current expenditures
All that the Treasury requires is the full benefit
of the act of the 19th October, as is proposed by
the bill under consideration. That act authorized
an issue of ten millions of Treasury notes, ledeem-
able in tw elve months from the date when issued,
for the purpose of enabling the Government to
collect, m the mean time, an equal amount which
was receivable in 1838 fiom our banks and mer-
chants Had these Treasury notes been redeetred
aftei the expiration of the twelvemonths, that is, be-
tween October, 1838 and June, 1839, the Treasuiy
would have been able to meet all its em> ígements
without any other financial measure They viere,
hov ever, made receivable for customs and land ,
and about five millions and a half had been al-
ready paid into the Treasury and cancelled It be
comes necessary, therefore, in oidei to secure to
the Treasury the benefit of the October act, to au
thon/e an issue of Tieasury notes equal to the
amount paid into the Treasuiy and cancelled prior
to the period fixed for their redemption This was
the extent of the aid the committee proposed, not-
withstanding the impression here and the m sre-
presenlalions abroad, that twenty millions would
be required
We have heird much sir here and ekew here
about a bankrupt Treasury, loans and a public
debt Such statements and anticipations are witn-
out found ilion Were it otherwise I trust the
bankiuptij of om rreasuiv,and the pr spect of a
public licit, would n( t be subjects c t rejoicing to
any gentleman What, sir, was the oiigin of these
Treasury notes, about which so much has been
said"* The counti) was m the midst ot a commer-
cial revulwon, and Congress assemb'ed for the
puiposeof exuoiMiig all its constitutional power-,
through lb financial measures, to rel eve trade as
far as it was practicable There was no bankruptcy
of the Treasury The resources of the Govern-
ment were ample but ilia public cieditois weie
unable to meet their engagements We had ex-
tended the ciedit to the Bank oí the United States
to one, two, and three }eais, and wcicabout to post-
pone the payment of our custom-house bends to
twelve and fifteen months, and the debt of the de
posile banks still longer Thus twentv millions ef
dull us ot the revenue oí 1837, and previous yens,
wue postponed to 183d, '3% and '40 To grant
this indulgence, it was necessary to make a tem-
por iry use oi our credit foi one-half the amount
of ou> i xisting íesources Such was the origin of
the Treasury note act of October
The pieseut embairassment of the Treasury does
not ause fiom any deficiency of resources, but
from the mode of executing the act of October
The rate of interest on the notes wasdiscretionaiy
w lln the President not exceeding six per cent per
annum Had he dnected none to be issued under
six pel cent most i f them would haie been taken
up by capilahsts oi remitted abroad, the Treasury
would ha\e been piotected, and no supplementary
act would have been necessary But there existed
a suspension of specie pajments, a derangement of
exchanges, and severe commercial embarrassment
The immediate interest of the Treasuij was
deemed subordinate to the general interests of the
country These interests were consulted by fur-
ni hing the public debtors with an additional
medium of pa} menl, and different sections of the
Union with facilities of exchange Nearly tu o
miilic ns mere issued at a nominal rate of m'erest,
nearly three at two per cent and over four mil-
lions at five per cent They were consequertly
paid into the Treasury mre months before they
were du<=, and this is the origin of its temporary em
barra ssment
There is nothing  sir, in the past or present con-
dition of the Treasury, nor m the prospect ahead,
363
to warrant this charge of bankruptcy, or to autho-
rize a public debt In October last, although we
had di nvn eight-and-twent} millions from the Fe-
deral Treasury and transferíed it to the States, we
had sti 1 due us six millions from the United States
Bank, eight mil1 ions from the deposite ban is and
six millions from our merchants, making twenty
millions In Januaiy last, with little more than
two millions of our credit outstanding, we had due
us and in the Tieasury eighteen millions, and at
this moment, if the debts due us from our banlcs
and merchants, arising from the revenue of lormer
years, were paid, we si ould have a balance of fif-
teen millions in the Treasury, even after paj mg off
five millions and a half of Treasury no es

rj and extm rdinary puipose. , if the. act of Octo
ber is earned into effect On the 1st oí January
we had half a million in theTreasui} TheTieasu-
rynotesnotthen i sued amounted to se\e millions
The amou u r*xen able from mei chants and banns in
1838 is about ten millions, and if the lev time ficm>
customs ard lands should amount to fftcen mil
lions and a h ilf, (bein0 u ree trillions less than the
estimate of the Secretaiy of the Treasuij ) the
aggregate resources of tuc jcar would be tmity-
thiee millions of dol ar In a long session t1 c ap
proonations ale made at a late peril 1 It is not,
tnereloie, probable that the dcniends upon me
Tieasury, during thejear, will exceed thu j. one
millions
Should, how \er, the resources cf thejear fall
below the foregoing estimate, or he demands upon
the Treasurj exceed even thirty three millions, we
should still not be justified in resorting to a loan
while we h?\e a re erved fund of seven million
and a hall due us in 1839 and '40 from the dejicsit
banks and the Bink o the United Stites
