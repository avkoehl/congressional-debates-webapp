HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, October 2, 1862.

Major General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN,Commanding U. S. Forces on the Potomac:

GENERAL: Major General A. P. Hill, of the C. S. Army, who had charge of the arrangements connected with the paroling of the prisoners at Harper's Ferry on the 15th ultimo, permitted General White to have the use of 27 wagons and teams, to carry the private baggage of the officers to some point convenient for transportation.*

It was agreed to between these two officers that these wagons and teams should be returned within our lines at Winchester in a few days, or, if that place should be in hands of the United States forces, then to the nearest Confederate post. I think proper to make known to you the above agreement, in order that some arrangement may be made for the return of the wagons and teams.

I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General, Commanding.

FAIRFAX COURT-HOUSE-11.45 a.m.

Major-General HEINTZELMAN:

Major Knox was at Aldie yesterday with the Ninth New York Cavalry. Made an attack on the town, and found a column of Stuart's cavalry at the brigade. He says it was the rear guard of Stuart's cavalry, who had come to Aldie day before yesterday, and were on their march from Aldie to Middleburg. Probably this is the force which came from Hopewell, and marched up to Aldie this side of Bull Run Mountain. I send you this morning two negroes from Winchester, with very interesting information.
