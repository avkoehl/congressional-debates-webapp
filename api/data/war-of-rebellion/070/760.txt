LYNCHBURG, June 13, 1864.

General BRAGG:

Lieutenant McPhail, aide to General Imboden, has just been sent to me by him. General Imboden sends me word that the enemy last night upon my front was 3,500 strong, and that there was another column advancing on the White's Gap 2,000 strong; that prisoners captured report that all their infantry will cross at White's Gap. I will do my best against them. The condition of this place is well known to you. I earnestly request re-enforcements. Imboden will have to go around the enemy. He is on their left flanks. I will probably have to come by a very roundabout way.

FRANCIS T. NICHOLLS,

Brigadier-General.

LYNCHBURG, June 13, 1864.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

I have just received the following dispatch from General Imboden, dated within four miles of Bent Creek bridge, 7.30 a. m. June 13, 1864:

About 4,000 of the enemy's cavalry moved up last evening from Potter's Mill, via Mount Moriah Church, toward Amherst Court-House, and another column of 2,000 with a train of over fifty wagons, was reported as moving over White's Gap road. I will reach Lynchburg with my division this evening. You are in no danger of attack, except by cavalry, for a day or two.

J. D. IMBODEN,

Brigadier-General.

I cannot keep advised of the enemy's movements. I have only few scouts, in whom, as a general thing, I have no confidence. I have prepared to the best of my ability. I have to hug the town. Want of force has compelled me to give up some strong positions.

FRANCIS T. NICHOLLS,

Brigadier-General.
