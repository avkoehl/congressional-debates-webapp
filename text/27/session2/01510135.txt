matteL as it pieced lit de pue ol anv exis mg ru'es of the
House, if th** Chair decided that the report hou'iinot be male,
an appeal would be taken from the decision, and a majority
could overrule it So it would be if the Speaker decided the
other way It was not very material, therefoie, which way the
Cha.11 decided And, under all thecircumstances of the case,
inasmuch as the House hid now again peiemptonly ordered
the committee to report a bill in compliance with the former
order, (under which the Chair then thought the report could
not be received, and which opinion the House sustained ) and
inasmuch as the mattet now assumed anothei form, and the
language of the order was that the report should be made in
atanter, the Chair thought it his duty to call on the committee
to make a report
Mr CUSHING    I appeal from the decision

t ow as the cise «food the Kouse m session no business havirg
intervened with an imperative demand upon the House
to carry out an undisputed order the Chair could not decide
otherwise thin as it had done    Tht result of such a decision
would be, to render nugatory the order which the Hoase itself
had given—to deprive it of the power to carry out «sown in-
structions
Mr BARNARD called for the reading of that portion of the
Journal of Tuesday which related to the decision of the Chair,
and the decision of the House u pon that decision, on the appeal
taken in \ elation to the bringing in of the report
Mr WISE objected to the readme Ii was m the nature of
argument.
Mr LEWIS WILLIAMS I presume we have a* right to
call for the reading of the Journal
The SPEAKER II objected to, the reading is not in order,
except by order of the House
Mr J C CLARK moved that the said portion of the Jour
nal be read and asked the yeas and nays on that motion
The SPEAKER The motion to lead the Journal is nc-t m
ordei, because there is a motion pending for the previous
question
Mr HOWARD Does the Speaker affirm the principle that
an older that a commu'ee shall lcport forthwith goes to sus
pend the 22d ru'e, which requires that committees shall tie
called in their order for reports after petitions shall have been
presented and disposed of 1 Does an order to report forthwith,
passed by a mere majority, operate a3 a vote of two thirds to
suspend the regular ordei of business^
The :spE 4KER said he decided that that rule, a? well as ali
others affecting the order of business, stood suspended Ape
tition had been presented m the order of business, mstructlond
had been passed, and the ronsummation(so tospeak)of the eu
tire business connected with that petition was m order
Mr HOWARD Then I inquire wh ther, while tMspr-*

order ioi a member of a committee to ofllr a report of acorn
