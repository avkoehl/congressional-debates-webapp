land with a regiment was in Cook County; further than this they did not claim to know anything about the location of rebel forces. They also report that the rumor prevailed in camp that Stand Watie was going to attempt a raid through Kansas, crossing the Arkansas west of this point. No troops except the Fourteenth Kansas have reported here yet. They are all dismounted. I shall except the Fifteenth soon, but they also are mostly dismounted. Have not yet heard anything of horses coming from below. The want of horses and additional troops is a serious obstacle to my doing anything to intercept a mounted force that may design crossing the Arkansas and making a raid north.
