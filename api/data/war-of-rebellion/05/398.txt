FREDERICK, MD., December 18, 1861-12 m.

Colonel Leonard reported last night and again this morning at 6.30 a threatened attack on Dam Numbers 5. by Jackson in force with boats. He thinks he is strong enough to protect it.

Have cautioned him not to withdraw attention from position by General Kelley, as this may be cover to other movements. [I] do not leave Frederick on this account.
