GenerL R. E. LEE:

General Stluart fought the enemy last evening at Sheppard's on the Tleegraph raod, with Wickham's and Lomax's brigades. Gordon is on the Mountin road. Stuart fell back over the Chickahominy Half- Sink to Woolrick's SHop. The firing this morning is in that direction. They appear to be forcing their way down the Peninsula. As soon as I find themcoming this way Ishall obstruct the roads and impede their march. General Stuart wounded.
