GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS THIRD ARMY CORPS, Numbers 26. Brandy Station, March 24, 1864.

Having been detached from the Army of the Potomac in consequence of its reorganization into three corps, I desire to express the personal feelings of regret with which the order is received. The consolidation of the corps gives this army greater strength. The generals to command them are conspicuous for their gallantry and ability. Only known in the department where bullets whistle, there is a strong probability that I may soon meet in the field those brave soldiers with whom I have been so long associated with pride and distinction.

WM. H. FRENCH,

Major-General of Volunteers.
