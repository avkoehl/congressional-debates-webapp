HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, Alrich's, May 9, 1864-12.45 [p.m.].

Lieutenant-General GRANT,Commanding Armies of the United States:

GENERAL: General Willcox reports himself heavily engaged with equal or superior numbers. This was prior to Stevenson joining him. I have sent a staff officer to him with instructions to report to me the state of affairs. I have ordered General Willcox to hold his position if possible, and have directed General Potter to halt a mile this side of Piney Branch Church, where he was ordered with a view to supporting General Willcox, if it becomes necessary. He can easily be moved to Piney Branch Church in a few minutes. General Willcox reports Generals Longstreet's and Hill's corps at Spotsylvania. Please send me word by bearer if I have done right in retaining General Potter; if not, I will send him at once to Piney Branch Church.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, May 9, 1864-12.45 p.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

I will direct the chief quartermaster to turn his trains back, so as to fall toward Chancellorsville if necessary. The enemy have disappeared from our right, moving in the direction of Gate evidently, which will enable us to follow from here. Direct Willcox to intrench and hold his position strongly, only falling back at the last extremity, expecting the enemy, if they have gone in force toward him, to be attacked from here.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, May 9, 1864-1.15 p.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

I hear artillery firing in the direction of Gate. I think it will be advisable for you to go there and take general charge in person.

Yours, truly,

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, May 9, 1864.
