to your telegram of to-day. I have now only the provost guard and the men on duty with General Easton. I feel safe if I can have cavalry to scout the country, but if this leaves me there is some danger of dash being made into the city, which would result in the loss of our stores. Shall I bring back the troops, or can the cavalry remain?
