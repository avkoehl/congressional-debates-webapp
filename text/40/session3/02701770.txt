WALLA-WALLA RAILROAD.
# Mr. WILLIAMS. The Committee on Pub-
lic Lands, to whom was referred the bill(H. R.
No. 1041) granting the right of way to the Walla-
Walla and Columbia River Railroad Company,
and for other purposes, have instructed me to
report it back withoutamendment; and as this
is a little bill to which there can be 110 objection
I ask to have it put upon its passage. It will
only take a moment.
The PRESIDENT^roitopore. The Sena-
tor asks the unanimous consent of the Senate
to consider the bill at this time. Does any Sen-
ator object V
There being no objection, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to consider
the bill. It proposes to grant the-right of way
through the public lands to the Walla- Walla and
Columbia River Railroad Company, a corpora-
tion existing under the laws of the Territory of
Washington and duly incorporated, for the pur-
pose of constructing a railroad from the town
of Walla-Walla to some eligible point on the
navigable waters of Columbia river in the Ter-
ritory; the right of way granted is to the extent
of one hundred feet in width on each side of the
road where it may pass over the public lands;
also all necessary ground, not to exceed five
acres at each station, for station-buildings,
workshops, depots, machine-shops, switches,
side-tracks, turn-tables, and water-stations.
The second section authorizes the county
commissioners of the county of Walla-Walla,
in the Territory of Washington, to aid in the
construction of the Walla-Walla and Columbia
River railroad by subscribing to the capital stock
of the company in the name and on behalf of
the county of Walla-Walla, and by issuing
bonds of the county payable at such time as
the commissioners shall think proper, and bear-
ing interest of not more than eight per cent,
per annum, in payment for the stock so by
them taken in the railroad company, or by issu-
ing bonds bearing interest as a loan to the com-
pany to be used in the construction of the road,
or to aid the company in the construction of
the road by the credit of the county in any
other manner the commissioners may think
proper; but the subscription, loan, or other aid
so given by the commissioners to the company
is in no case to exceed the sum of $300,000;
and the subscription, loan, or other aid is to
be submitted to the people of the county and
voted for by three fourths of the legal vote cast
at an election held for that purpose; and if the
vote be taken at a special election the notice
is to be the same as provided by the laws of
the Territory for general elections.
The third section authorizes the county com-
missioners of the county of Walla-Walla, in the
Territory of Washington, to hold a special elec-
tion, at such times as they may designate, after
twenty days' public notice, which election shall
be governed by the general laws of the Terri-
tory upon the subject of elections, at which
election the aid to be given by the county to
the Walla-Walla and Columbia River Railroad
Company, either by subscriptions to stock or
