SIR: I have the honor to inclose you the report of Captain Benson, commanding Battery M, of the Regular Artillery, attached to my command at the battle of Hanover.* I regret this report did not arrive in time to go in with my own, as it gives some details and notice of individual acts which I desire to call to the attention of General Porter, commanding general on that occasion. I cordially indorse the commendations of Captain Benson, and also ask attention of the general commanding, who was himself present, to the conspicuous gallantry and cool judgment displayed by Captain Benson himself. It will be recollected that when the enemy was engaged it was without regard to his force and before the body of the division came up. It was my good fortune to have had this same officer and his battery with me on the 4th of May, in the affair on the left preceding the battle of Williamsburg, where I had occasion to notice his conduct in similar terms.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

On the 27th, after the enemy was repulsed, my regiment, with the exception of Lieutenant A. K. Arnold's squadron, was ordered to advance, and upon reaching a by-road Captain Royall was detached with his squadron to follow the direct road. The balance of the regiment followed Captain Benson's battery down the by-road, when we came to an opening giving us a view of the enemy and what I supposed to be a wagon train, which I pointed out to General Emory, who ordered me
