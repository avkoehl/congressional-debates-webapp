An empty train on its way from the army was attacked 4 miles from here by a small band of guerrillas, 1 or 2 men slightly wounded. Thirteen wagons were destroyed. This, I think, was owing to want of precaution ont eh part of the guard. Some of the mules belonging to the train escaped and came in. Colonel Cesnola, Fourth New York Cavalry, who has just arrived from Fredericksburg, reports a force of rebel cavalry, supposed to consist of two regiments under General Rosser, in that neighborhood. One of the Ninth Virginia Cavalry captured by my scouts to-day. By the 30th I hope to abandon by land with the Illinois cavalry to Washington. The whole of the Invalid Battalion will have to be transported to the White House by water, as the march from Belle Plain has completely knocked them up. I have received no instructions from General an order to move everything by Hanovertown.

Brigadier General JOHN A. RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have your communication of 26th instant, in relation to officers of the Fourth U. S. Infantry. I expect to leave this place on 30th instant, for White House, Va. There shall be no delay in forwarding these officers to their regiment. Seven hundred and fifty men went forward to the Army of the Potomac this a. m., guarding a train; 2,650 men, in battalions and detachments, leave here in the morning for the front, with a large train. This leaves me, for the protection of the depot, about 1,400 men (infantry), 700 of whom are from Invalid Corps, and cannot march; the res are detachments from many regiments that I have organized and made serviceable. Also two batteries artillery and 2,000 cavalry, mounted and dismounted, the latter serving as infantry. All will be mounted at White House and sent forward to you. The garrison of Fredericksburg has just arrived, about 3,000 strong-1,000 cavalry, and 2,000 infantry, stragglers, squads from Camp Distribution, &amp;c.

These will be forwarded shortly.

GENERAL: I regret very much the pontoon train could not be sent to you much sooner, but two substantial reasons have rendered the delay unavoidable. When your order was received, one of the trains
