made scarce, the cmiency was disturbed, credit re-
ceived a shock, and, for some four months m suc-
cession, we heard nothing here but scenes of dis-
tress, general rum, and almost famine, and all in a
time oí ab gieat plenty and abundance, not oí the
necessaries of life only, bin of money, as our coun-
try had ever witnessed     The panic passed off, and
business of every  description, and enterpnse of
every charactci, sprung into increased life and ac-
tivity    The public lands commenced to sell ra-
pidly, and our revenues became excessive    Tl en
came the second  comphmt, w hich  h<> proposed to
notice, ind it  -«as that the whole splendid public
domain, that rich inheritance ñ ira our fatheis of
the Revolution, under the  operation of ths "pet
bank system," «as going 01 gone, was being ex-
changed, for whaf   Tor "bank rags "   That com-
plaint lasted us foi the most of one session of Con-
gress, but nothing w as done, by legislation   to re-
medy the evil    The accumulations oí revenue
had by this time comí to be vast, and this gave
use to a third complaint    It was double in its cha-
racter and contradictory with itself, an \ yet it enter-
tained us during a large share of one of our sessions,
and finally produced legislation  It was, to day, that
the Government v, as actually locking up in  the
bant-sail the money of the country, while the honest
and hard woikmg citizens were suPtrmg íor its
use     To-mono ,   the  almost countess   millions
were  loaned by the pet banks to favorites of die
Executive, and members ot the dominant political
part) , to enable them to make speculations  in the
public lands, and in all othei descriptions of pro-
perty, to  the injury of fair busmess men, and the
rum  oí  the pool     So  far were these compiamts
carried, inconsistent r-ndcontradictoiy as they weie,
as to make a sensible impression upon the  public
mind, and finally to induce almost ill the members
of this body to vote for the deposite law of 1836,
which was to dissipate this hoarded fund, and place
it in safe keeping with the States    The Sec ictary
of the Treasury commenced the necessan mea-
sures to execute this law, and very soon found that
the money which had been so njuruusk houded,
in our debates here, had been, in fact, ruhti  too
much dissipated before Congress mli rlcred v ith it.
This, laiscd  another compluu      ibe  Scoretai)

would not have been injured     Dunn™ the first pa-t
of this proces , the sale oí  tne public lands con
unued at an accelerated pace, and, although Con
gress made a strenuous, but fruitless, effort to re-
medy  the evil, the  complaint comment °d agin
that  the  public domain was bung exchanged for
irresponsible bark paper   1 he President look up ihe
subject, after Congress left  t, and directed the land
officers to receive no'hing but gold ami silver in pay-

fiom their customer   These col'ections occasioned
a scarcity of money, and it was the "Specie Citcu-
lar" which had done it Then foreign debts pressed
upon the merchants, and the call j upon th m from
the banks disenabled them to pa),  but the Specie
Circular had w iought the mischief, by man lung all

increase, extensive failures of merchants and othcis
took place, and, finally, m May last,all the b mitsol

ment was principally m f ult, the Specie Circulai
had taken all the metal'ic cur enc\ to the i tertr,
and pievented it from gomp to Europe to pay our
foieign debt, and  the bank-, could not p-1}  specie
until that debt «as  encelle 1     Time pissed on
The funds of the Tie isury vei  in the b"nks, and,
could  not be  commanded,  and  an extra  call ot
Congiesst became  net ssary to relieve the deb'ois
of the Government, ai d supply the Treasu-j with
fund'     The banks were complained of, for then
exces-.es and impr ividerc, md lie fault was that
of the Government, for having placed in their hands
such immense deposites, to be called for so sud-
denly, and for having checked their excessive issues
of paper by the Specie Circular Congiess w as con-
vened, and the present President tiansmitted his
Message, proposing to end these compiamts by an
entire severance of all business connection between
he National Treasury and the banking institutions.
This, at once, changed the face oí things, and
showed the Resident and the Administration hostile
to the banks, and now, although the foieign elebt is
paid, and foreign exchange down to pai, the banks
cannot resume pa) ment foi tear of the Govern-
ment
He would ask, in all candor, and in all sinceri-
ty, if any histor) of facts could show, more con-
clusively, the jmpropnet) of this connection be-
tween the finances oí tne countiy and the affaiis
of individuáis and banking incorporations' If
there was a man who heard him, who did not see
and feel the necessi y of ¡eliev ing the Government
of his country from those constant and contiadic-
or) complaints'1 The pioposed system will do
that, and, in his judgment, that «done would be one
ol the greatest benefits which could be conferred
upon the nation
If such w ill be the influences upon oui finances
and Government, of the system pioposed, what m-
ñuences are to In expected fiom the ¡state bank
system'' Certainly to place the money of the peo-
ple bt)ond the control oí the stivants of the peo-
ple, and vuthm the conliol ol the banks, to disen-
able the Government to pay its debts, except in a
depreciated currency, xvhenevci the notes of the
banks are depreciated, or to abandon its money,
collected and accumulated in the banks to meet its
debts, as a resource for that purpose, and to resort
to its ciedit to raise the means by which Itgal p ly-

present a stanchid of currency woithy of imitation,

ments, it winld constantly circula  among the
peonle a basis for the paper curre, c/ of the State
banks, and thus aid them in keeping their lepre-
sentatiou of coin stable and firm, and equal m
value to coin itself Beyond thesp influence-, it
would leave the people and the States to regulate,
in their own way, and without ihe interference oi
federal power, that portion of the general currency
which, by the divisions of power under our system,
falls wtthm their jurisdiction and is the constant
subject of their action It would then be clear to
all, if that portion of the currency should sink
below the standard of currency for the public Trea-
sury, that v. rong existed somewhere in State legis-
lation, or in .he management of those entrusted by
State legislation with the regulation oi that cur-
ienc), and the fedeial authorities would be free
irom imputation or suspicion, and would stand
before the whole country holding up the true stan-
dard of currency, and inviting from the State au-
thorities a correction of the errors which should at
an) time disturb or depreciate that portion com-
mitted to their care
How , in this respect, does the opposite system
act? The State banks are, to much the greatest, if
not to the entae, extent, private institutions, con-
trolled by private individuals and private interests,
and owned in whole, oi to the extent of a majority
of the capital, by private citizens, as private pro-
perty Pnvate gam, then, asanecessary and natu-
ral consequence of the very constitution of these
banks, was their principle of government, and, as
an equally necessary and natural consequence, they
would keep that portion of the currency which
they x\ere authorised to furnish for the country, at
a sound, standard value, when private interest,
and the prospect of private gam, should so direct,
and thev would suffer it to depreciate by the same
rule. Give them the national treasure, and permit
them to subject it to the fluctuations of their inte-
rest, and can a stable currency be expected, either
lor the Tieasury oi the people' Who arc the le-
gitimate customeis of the banks' More particu-
larly the merchants Their business pervades not
the whole oí then own country only,but the whole
civilized wold The laws of the States oi the
Union, therefoie, are regulations much too limited
for them , and even the laws and regulations of
any smgli Government, as to either trade oi cur-
rency, ait but municipal in their chaiacter, when
applied to 'heir operations Still they themselves
have local hibitauons, and the case may well and
Irequentl) occur, when it is vastly more important
to them that they should be able to command specie
to export, in liquidation oí their foreign debts,
than that our local banks at home should redeem
their notes in specie What, in such a condition
of trade and of the mercantile interest, will always
be hkel) to be the condition <rf our local banks' Set
aside the consideration that the meichants may be
able to control those institutions fiom the stock
they hold, and meiel) assume that they are the
principal debtois to the 'banks, and are to continue
to be tin ir principal ca tomers Let the argument
ícsr heie, and give the banks the possession and
conliol of ihe national treasure Which interest
would prevail' Would the Treasury of the coun-
try be sustained, and the payments to the public
creditors be made in spet ie, or its equivalent,
or wutil 1 the views md v íshts oi t* t meichants be
consisted, a id the curreiic he mae'e to bend to
pnvate and corporate interests' L t th¿ experience
of the list ) e ir answer th * inquiry He would
exprt s his coninmed opinio-!, that, under such a
s)stem, the cunency of the public Treasuiy must
shfie Ml the reverses and fluctuations of foreign
and domrst c trale, and all the ha/ards of corpo-
rate bai.Kin^, as a private interest I tence the ope-
rations ol the 1 itnsury itsr II must be suspended, or
the law ol Congiess, as to currency, violated, when-
ever revulsions shall oppress the country,.and 'he
customers of th" banks, or the alternative be re-
sorted to, as it iccently has 'wi, by the rational
authoiitus, to c nvoke Congress, relieve the banks
and tte rulhc debtors, and resort to the credit of
the natío i to sustain its Treasury, unt 1 the natural
operation o 1 dthful business shall again restore
