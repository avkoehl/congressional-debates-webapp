Brigadier-General RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff, Armies of the United States:

SIR: There have been quite a number of men, women, and children, all of rebellion proclivities, and many of them well informed as to military matters, sent to these headquarters to be sent across the lines. As we are nearer Richmond here than at any other point, our army more concentrated and open to observation, have no place of entertainment or confinement for rebel women or children, and some of the women ought to be confined while here, and as they have necessarily opportunities for learning and seeing while here much that should be not known to rebel leaders, I respectfully represent that it is dangerous and improper to have such persons pass these lines at all while we are prosecuting the war. I therefore recommend that no more come here, and all those now here be sent to some place where there are no operations going, on and then passed south, if such is deemed the best disposition which can be made of them. The whole frontier is open to them, and operations are going on but at two of three points.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General, Commanding.
