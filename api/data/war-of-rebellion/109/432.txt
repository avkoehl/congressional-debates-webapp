the enemy has gone into Mississippi, leaving only small guerrilla parties in this district. Colonel Forrest had joined Richardson at Dyersburg and they both retreated southward on the approach of Colonel Hatch's forces. Two men they had conscripted near Dyersburg escaped from them about ten miles south of Bolivar on Friday last. I consider this information reliable, but will know more definitely about it when my scouts shall have returned.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. E. WARING, Jr.,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
