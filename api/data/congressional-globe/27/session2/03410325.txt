CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
to lengthen the period of the loan from twelve to fifteen years,
Mr F was not anxious either one way or the other, he had no
objectiotitoit,if the committee thought it best, but he should
not press it. He could conceive a state of circumstances in
which such an arrangement would be beneficial totheTrea^u
ry, but from the mformation.received from the TieasuiyDe
partment the Committee of Ways and Means had learned that
twelve years would meet the views of the Secretary, and they
did not feel called upon to go btyond what he aske 1 for When
he had been asked hy the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr Ca
ruthers] whether any communication had beei received pro
posing a longer term, his reply had been a qua lhed one—that
nothing had been received m writing which asked lor a longer
term than twelve years, and it was only communications m
writing that werefoimally acted on m the committee 01 could
be here as to vcibal coriver&at ons, the Committee of Way^ and
Means never recognised tht m as legitimate giounds of us ac
tion, they were always open to mistake and misunderstanding,
and furnished no ground m conect m sapprehen=ion No wilt
ten communication had spoken ot more than twelve years
Mr WISE approved of this i ule, but inquued whetheL the
communications referred to did not speak of this, term of twelve
years as the fninimutu, length of the term"?
Mr FIIIAIORE said he had been just about to lead what
the Department had wimen, and then the gentlemen could
judge foi himself The last cotnm tmca ion laid before the
committee wasa report from the Secietaiy of the Treasury to
the Presiden-of the Imited States, communicated on the 8th
of this present month, m which, after suggesting the propnet>
of an increase in the amount of the loan, the Seuetary said it
must he obvious that the state of the Tieasury demanded the
immediate interposition of Congress to save the credit of the
Government, and suggested that the only means to effect the
relief would be to prolong the penod of the proposed loan to
at leant twelveyears, and to pledge the revenue for repayment
This, Mr F supposed, implied that twelve years was the mi
nimum and tlie maximum de&ired
Mr TjNDE-RWOOD said it had become fashionable oflate
to charge tne disgrace under which Governmtnt was laboimg
to the passage of vhe land bill, and he had heaid this repc<*itd
tillhe was really tired of it
The CHAIR reminded Mr Underwood that the question be
fore the committee was on extending the period of the pioposed
loan
Mr UNDERWOOD said he was fully aware of thai but a
gentleman fiom NewYoik [Mi Gordon! had just leiteiated
the charge, m when his colleague [Mr R,oosE\ELT]Feemid to
agree, and if it v.aa in oidei for them to make the cnarge he
supposed It was as much in order !or him to reply Mr U
here went into a brief rew&ion oí the dec rea e of ire íeve
nue, and its causem the comprar sc act, &c and accused the
late AdmiriiRLi Uion, with this fact he ore tl pu eyes ofhav
ing neglected and íefused to provide, by tne íequibite taxi
tion, to meet the cucumstances oí the country And as to
the distribution of he proceeds of the public lands anions the
States, so clear wasthenghtof the S ates to them tha* couid
thecase be brought before a com^eten^ court ofthanceiy thf*
Government might be coerced to surrendei then tiust over tlie
lands
The CHAIR said this wasa very wide depaituic from the
question under debate
Mr UNDERWOOD said he had only replied to others wl o
had preceded him  however, he would take his seat
Mr McKEON trusted that this proposition to extend the term
to fifteen years, would not succeed When loan bill No 1 was
intioduced at the extra session, its  friends produced it with a
limitation ofeight years The Hou&e hai v*.ry proppily re
duced it to three years iiere is loan bill No 2 presented to us,
with a proposition for a loan of twelve yeart. That is not
deemed sufficient, without a fuither extension to fifteen yedvt

Mr McK lamented the present prostration of the finances of
the countrv The minority on this floor had no part m bring-
ing it to this position
There was anothei reason why he should prefer the term oí
twelve years The Secretary of the Treasuiy had informed us
that at least twel ve years should be the term of the loan The
gentleman from Virginia had said this was the m. mmutn term
m the opinion of the Secretary He, Mr McK wou'dtake it
as ¿A* term for which the Secretary desired the loan As a
term of twelve years had been named by the Secretary,and none
other, he should take him at his word and not go one moment
beyond tt
Mr PENDLETON If a debt existed it was of compara-
tively little impouance with what administration it originated
those who were to pay it would not ask that question The
debt was now upon us 1 his bill did not create a public debt,
t onlv proposed a means of collecting what it owed and consol
idatmg the whole of its debts nto one, and giving certificate as
evidence of the existing debt The nation owed the debt and
this bill would not increase it a dollai it was in existence, and
it was fer Congress to provide the means of its extinguishment
The gentleman from New York [Mr Roose* elt] had proposed
to content him&elf with defending himself and those who acted
with him from the charge of negligence in providing means to
the exigencies of the Treasury taut he had not been content with
this, but had sought to inculpate the late Secietary of the Trea
suiy, Mr Ewmg, but for this Mr P would not have deemed
it worthwhile to trouble the committee He did not rise to de
fend that distinguished gentleman no, hut to pjead guilty in
his name And what had been the formidiblo charge advanced
against him? Why that he had caused the lean office ceitifi
cates to be hawked about the monev markets from Boston to Ba -
more to endeavor toget money, if possible, at 5£ percent m
stead of giving six1 Enoimous guilt, indeed1 Onlysubsti
tute another word for 'hawked,' and the charge wouldle-
dound to the Seci etary's honoi but a disgraceful word was of
ten employed to di*ciedit the most meritorious actions
Mr ROOSEVELT said that he had not introduced the word
"hawked" if he had used it at all, he only followed the gentle
man from Vngmia,[Mr "Wise]
Mr PENDLETON resumed and admitted that Mr Ewing
had mad the most b lenuouw efllntsm his power to save the
public money by getting the loan on the best terms he could,
and he did get about half of it at5i per cert
Mr ROOSEVELT here explained, (the floor heme yielded
for the purpose,) insisting that the loan had not been i efnspd on
the ground of time, but b^cau^e the Secietaiy had been hig*
gling fir lower terms than the bill allowed the whole of he
twelve miliionb could at onct- have been obtained at simper
cent lie had made no rhaige against the lutein y of the
Secretary the chaige was directed against his financial skill
alone
Mi PENDLFTON Thegentkman had charged the fulure
of the loan to >h L«i ig's anxieiy to get the money at 5£ pt.r
cent an ' said that the whole migut have been taken up at once
had he given the 6 per cent allowed in the bill Yes, and great
financul skil'theie would have bpen in that, to take up the
whole in August, when a Iai ge part was not wanted till Decern
ber1 But, if it were true that the negotiation of the last loan
failed from the condust of the negotiating ofilcei, and this alone,
then it followed there was no need of extend ng the time to fii
teen years, as proposed Ifthewholeamountasked couldhave
been got then on a loan lunnmgthieeyear**, money could now
be got on a loan i tinning twe ve years For the money of the
conntiy wdb st'll in the bame hands there had been ro loan
efected&ince And it was a wtil estábil her! financial truth
that the hatder the times the sieater the facility with which
Government could borrow money Mr P was opposed to ex
tending the time he would not put it out of the power of the
Government to redeem the public debt for one moment longer
than was absolutely unavoidable He trusted nobody supposed
that even tweivo yea^s would have elapsed before this loan
was repaid The secietary of the Tieasttry, whose duty n was
to recommend plans of finance, had asked for but twe've years,
and what was asked wasto fee presumed to be the minimum
amount needed, both as to sum and as to Hme In granting
what they askf-d, Mr P felt himself under the same obligation
to comply, on the subject of time, as m theamountgnnted
It had been «aid by another gentleman from New York [Mi
McKeon 3 that the loan had faded because Government had
given aw ly its mean? Now, if the mean-s fhe gentleman re
(erredtoh^ 1 been thesecunty on whith the loan wdb to be
made, and the Goveinmenthad parted with that there might
be some foice m what the gentleman eaui but ltwisnnttrue

Ihe gentleman from New \oik [\Tt Roisevelt] lamented
in doleful strains that tie 8200 000 íeceivtd fir public lands
since the 1 tof íanuary ha I notgone into the Treasury I hat
would have relieved the honor of the Government, and e? ved
the pubfic credit, by payi ig off Treasuiy notes Indeed ' Two
hundred thousand dollars obviate the necessity of bonowing
twelve millions
Mt ROOSE\ EI T pvplampd    Up had not siid this
Mr PENDLETON admitted he had not eypiessly said it,
but it was implied m his argument
Mi ROOSEVELT paid he had aid only that thebe 9200 000
would have paid t ff so much of the interest due on Treasury
notes
Mi PENDLETON Well, and if it hd, the notes would
asambeundei protest thenextday II nv would this save the
credu of the Government
Mr P m conclusion, reiterated his opposition to the amend
ment pioposed by Ir Wise, íelymg >n the statements fiom
the Treasuiy then bhowed that an extension of the tune of the
loan was netesbdry, but that twe've yeais Viould beasiifTi
ciently long period
Mr EVERETT &aid that when the sub|ect of truing Trea
surv notes had been up m the House it had «fiuck him as in
vojving great danger, that the Government would sH nto the
couise of peipetually boirowmg and borrowing msteid of
providing the means to pay its debts And it struck him now,
that the Government were beginning at the wi mg (nd^ and
that their couise could lead only to still gieater embarrass
ment* Tn«y were borrowing money w len no means had been
provided to redeem the debt It had been with great reluc
tancethathe had brought himselt to vote for the last issue of
Tieasuiynotes heshouldnow take a stand,and utterly refuse
to vote for either notes or loan until means weie {ravidedto
meet and to redeem th^m He was aware, lüdeedrahatsona*
temporary embarrassments might result from this course, aji£
that the notes of the Govemmentmight «Veil be under protest;
but even that would, in his estimation, he a les  «v]l than
this eternal running in debt and never providing mean  to
pay Let Congress look the evil in the face, and
set to wor k and provide means to meet it. Let
this be done, and then he should be willing to go mto any
means temporarily to anticipate the means provided. But
now nothing was proposed as relief, hut some form of going
into debt Where was the money to be got for this loan?
Would gentlemen run abroad for it m the existing state of
American cedttm Europe? No, they must rely on our home
resources, and these were ample, ample He had heard It
said, and with great truth, that there never had been a time
since the loundation of ihe Government when the rich were bo
rich or the pooi so poor as now It was true that some capi-
talists had gone mto State stocks, but the more prudent men
had not done this The first class would s^ek relief under the
bankrupt faw, but there were heavy capitalists who could be
relied onif adequate security were only provided, but, instead
of this, loan after loan was gone into, and these securities weie
thus tobe peipetually depreciated Mr E professed himselj
against the bill m any shape, and this notwithstanding the em-
barrassments which might be produced by rejecting it He
would give the Government no facilities to borrow, but would
forrp them back on the only true policy, which was to provide
arevenue Heregretted that neither the Committee of Ways
and Means nor the Committee oa Manufactures had yetrepoit-
ed a bill for this purpose
The CJIAIR here restrained Mr Eon the ground of irrele-
vancy    The question was on the time the loan was to run.
Mr EVERETT was against all «me [A voice, "And eter-
nity, too, I suppose"—a laugh ] He wasagamst fifteen yeais,
against twelve years, against any years at all, lie was show-
ing thatanother measure ought to have been brought up before
this They had an ived at this day of the session, and yet no
plan had been introduced for filling the Treasury by a perma-
nent revenue He should have been gratified to see a bill be-
fore now, but if none appeared soon, he should try to present
one himself, if he could make it in order He was prepared for
all consequences, he would risk them all sooner than thus
plunge into interminable debt
Mr SMITH of Virginia observed that as he understood the
proposition, the House was asked to extend the term of this loan,
to twelve years, simply because it was believed that without
such extension the capitalists of the country would not subscribe
to it He understood that it was only on this ground that the
proposition to extend the loan was made His colleague from
Accomac, [Mr Wise ] with the same object in view, had sub-
mitted a proposition to extend the term still three years longer
He would concede for the present that it was necessary, 1001
der to obtain this loan, to extend the term of Us duration  but at
the samo time he would íemark that the who'aargument was
predicated on the assumption that there wa-  a sufficiency of c,i
pital in the country to take it Now, if the objet t of this exten
sion ol time was to bring out this capital, an interesting inquiry
arose whether such extension of time was the true means of at
taming the object in view It was a palpable and undeniable
proposition that it was not the interest ofthis or of any other coim
try to pay interest one day longer than it could be possibly
avoided The time had gone by when a national debt could be
considered as a national blessing, or that public prospeuty could
be promoted by impobing additional burdens on the people
Ht, submitted, then, to the House, whether the true policy if
the Government, a* well as the best mode of obtaining the
money, would not be to restrict the period of the loan to three
years, and to command the capital Of the country by uici easing
the rate of interest If the money could be procured by in-
creasing the term of the loan, couid it not moie easily be had
by mci easing the late of interest? Would it not be hetter for
every intciest m the countiy to restnct the penod of time and
raise the interest, than to extend the time He had an amend
ment, which he intended to offer at a propei time, to limit the
term to three vears "and at such rate of interest, not exceeding
8 per cent as may be agreed on between the Secretary of the
Treasury and the peisons making such loan   Here, said Mr
S are two modts proposed of obtaining this money One
by extending the period of the loan to fifteen years
and paying six per cent interest for that] >enod, amounting to
five million four hundred thousand dellara, ant the other which
he inter ded to submit, restricting the term to three years, and
payngS per cent interest for that period, amounting to one
million four hundred and lurty thousand dollars Now on
thissimple statement of the question he would submit it to tha
committee which w<m the most advantageous to the country, to
create a debt a' i* U ng period at six per cent or to create a debt
tor a short peno ' at eight per cent He did not hesitate to say
that linking to the ample capacities of the country to meet is
engagements, the plan he proposed was a much better
mode of reliving the Government than that of the Committee
of Ways and Means or the amendment of hi^ colleague W e
weie told, said Mr 8 the other day, tl at the morey could be
readily obtained, and we had a letter reíd t > us fiom Prime,
Ward audKmg, ^howmgthat if we would raise thei<te of in
terest to seven per cent the loan cou'd be negotiated
He was one of those who did not look upon thtse embarrass
mentsof the Government as a source of unmitigated regre
On the contrary, he was one of those who believed that there
wa^somt virtue in them He believed that under the influ-
ence of an overflowing Treasuiy the Government had lushed
mto a heedless aad improvident expenditure, which sound eco
nomy could not approve He believed that it was idle jo ta.fc
