HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT SOUTHEAST MISSOURI,Cairo, Ill., September 11, 1861.

Colonel G. WAAGNER, Chief of Artillery, Norfolk, Mo.:

You will renew your reconnaissance of yesterday, pushing as far down the river as practicable, and annoying the enemy in every way possible. Colonel Oglesby is instructed to give you all the force that can be spared from Norfolk, and the gunboat Conestoga will act in conjunction with you. Should you make any important discoveries, inform me as early as possible.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT SOUTHEAST MISSOURI,Cairo, Ill., September 11, 1861.

Colonel R. J. OSLESBY, Norfolk, Mo.:

Send back to your post for rations. The forces from Cairo will be relieved as soon as another regiment arrives to take their place.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major-General FREMONT:

He has carried out of North Missouri a large part of the ruffians and bridge-burners who have committed outrages. Within a few days all will be quiet again. I go forward to Saint Joseph, and thence to Keokuk. I will have Glasgow and Brunswick immediately visited by a strong force, and as soon as the regiment of Glover, Moore, Tindall, and Forster are ready I will turn the regiments to the line of the Missouri River.

HUDSON, MO., September 12, 1861.

Major-General FREMONT:

The Sixteenth Illinois and the Second Kansas, numbering about 1,100 men, with two pieces of artillery, go forward this morning, to occupy Saint Joseph. As soon as the Platte River Bridge is repaired, I shall march on Glasgow, where Green and Bevier are arriving, to cross the Missouri in three columns-from point, from Brookfield, and from Sturgeon, on North Missouri. I am awaiting here the arrival of a regiment from Mexico. There are several small squads dispersed from
