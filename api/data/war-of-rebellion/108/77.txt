Organization of Southern telegraph line has bee completed to- day by the selection of Dr. W. S. Morris, of Lynchburg, as president, and J. R. Dowell, general superintendent The line from Alexandria south is now entirely distinct and disconnected from line at Washington and north. The new officers are Virginians and sound to the ocre. The most p[erfect confidence may be placed in them and in their zeal and devotion to the Southern cause. The wires between Alexandria and Washington have been taken down.

L. P. WALKER:

New York papers relucatntly acknowledge commercial interests as going to wreck and ruin. Henry Fisher, banker, Philadelphia, suspended; liablitiesm $1,000,000. Other failures anticipated. Passengers from Washington represent terrible state of affairs. Houses broken open, pillaged by soldiers; females insulted on streets and in their own houses; innocent citizens violently treated on merest pretext of suspicion; soldiery represnted as drunke, thieving, ungovernable mob. Pony express from California arrived Fort Kearny. News of taking of Sumter had paralyzed business interests there. Insurance agents refuse to insure t resure aginst hazards of war. Legislature rejected bill calling for Congressional election 18th of May, the object of which was to elect two members of Congress for extra session. Another installment Baltimoreans arrived in Richmond this evening, fully armed and equipped for service. Sherman's battery and five companies of U. S. infantry arrived Washington. Came through Baltimore. Baltimore will soon be garrisoned. General Lee is now acting very vigorously.
