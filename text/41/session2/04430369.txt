Value.
Corn 191,111 bushels $231,264
Meal 142,861 barrels  880,902
A large portion of all this is exported from
Canada to other countries, which proves that
even now the Canada route furnishes cheaper
transportation than our American routes.
But a considerable portion is consumed in
Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and
elsewhere. Two years ago the Dominion duty
of twenty-five cents a barrel on our flour was
repealed to satisfy Nova Scotia, and in 1868
that province consumed American wheat and
flour of the value of $1,289,378. If we con-
tinue our present policy the Dominion duty
will be renewed, and Canada will supply flour
to Nova Scotia and exclude our wheat from
the provinces.
We imported in 1868 from Canada 1,593,821
bushels wheat, valued at $2,704,125, and
78,000 barrels flour, valued at $572,444.
tariff.
The Committee of Ways and Means have
recommended a reduction of the tariff on many
articles. Everywhere itis conceded there ought
to be some reduction. On what articles can
we so well afford to reduce or remove duties
as on lumber, fish, coal, and salt? They are
indispensable to the common wants of all the
people. If duties on these articles shall be
removed the necessity will still exist for reve-
nue derived from duties levied on other articles,
and here is ample room for protection. This
measure, then, should command the approval
of the advocates of protection.
ANNEXATION.
But it maybe said that the British provinces
and Canada depend upon trade with the United
States for thpir prosperity, and that a denial of
this trade will hasten annexation to the United
States. But this does not follow.
The population of old Canada is 3,310,134 ;
New Brunswick, 302,950 ; Nova Scotia, 375,-
511.
* The principal products of Nova Scotia are
coal and fish, which came into this country
free under the reciprocity treaty. Upon the
termination of that treaty the export demand
and the product were greatly reduced. Nova
Scotia demanded of the Canadian Parliament
a duty of fifty cents a ton on coal imported
from the United States, and the exclusion of
our citizens from the inshore fisheries of the
Canadian coast. These measures would give
to Nova Scotia the coal trade of Canada and
the control of the mackerel fisheries.
So far Parliament has declined to adopt
these measures because, as it is alleged, they
hope to arrange reciprocal trade with the Uni-
ted States. In May last the Canadian finance
minister, in a speech in the House of Commons,
said:
"Sir, allow me to add that the time may come
"when the excex>tional interests to which I haveal-
luded, which are now suffering with ppocial severity,
will have to be considered by this House. [Cheers.J
But I do not think that the time to do this is when
we may be on the eve of opening up negotiations on
the whole question."
If we do not arrange some commercial terms
we will lose the export coal trade to Canada
and the privileges of the inshore fisheries of
the Canadian coast.
The course of the Dominion Parliament has
produced dissatisfaction in Nova Scotia. But
one of her prominent citizens, It. Gr. Halibur-
ton, esq., in a paper addressed to the Gov-
ernor General of Canada, said :
" The imposition of a duty on American coals sim-
ilar to that which is levied on ours will cut the
ground from under the feet of agitators who repre-
sent the Dominion Government as indifferent to our
maritime and mining interests."
If we refuse some arrangement for recipro-
cal trade the Dominion will adopt retaliatory
duties and seek new commercial alliances. In
41st Cong. Sess.—No. 24.
the Dominion House of Commons on the 28th
of May, 1868, the finance minister, referring to
the termination of the reciprocity treaty, said:
"It forced on the enterprising people of this coun-
try the necessity of seeking other markets, and the
result of this has been in the highest degree gratify-
ing. Many of our products which formerly went to
the United States have found more remunerative
markets. The exports of Canadian products to other
countries have gone on Increasing in a very large
proportion, although the trade with the United States
has fallen off. And here let me for one moment refer
to a trade which I believe as firmly as I stand here
might be laid hold of by this country. I reter to the
West India trade. In those markets we might find
a profitable market for most of the surplus products
of Canada. The recent report of the commissioners
called attention to the important fact that the British
and Spanish West Indies received from the United
States products which we can just as well send: such
as lumber, flour, butter, cheese, staves, shooks, boots
and shoes, hardware, &e. The British West India
islands alone received of these articles to the extent
of 810,000,000 a year, the Spanish Westlndies to the
figure of $8,000,000, and if we add Hayti and San Do-
mingo we find an aggregate trade of nearly twenty-
five million dollars with the United States in articles
which we producc and might supply."
Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland
are yet out of the Dominion. If we encourage
commercial intercourse with them we can keep
them out.
If by wise legislation we make the commer-
cial interests of Canada and the British prov-
inces identical with our own she will soon seek
annexation to render the advantages perma-
nent. We may thus accomplish our "manifest
destiny" to extend our power northward to
the pole and make the continent ours.
This House, by resolution of March 22,1869,
has substantially indorsed the policy I have
urged, and now let us advance to its consum-
mation.
In illustration of these views, I present some
statistical tables alike interesting and valuable:
