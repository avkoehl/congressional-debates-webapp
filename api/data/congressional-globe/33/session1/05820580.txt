| lish a post road in the State of California; which

HOMESTEAD BILL.
Mr. WALKER. Mr. President, the Commit-
tee on Public Lands, to whom was referred the
bill granting a homestead of one hundred and
sixty acres of the public lands to actual settlers,
have done me the honor, unanimously, to direct
me to report it back to the Senate without amend-
ment, and to recommend its passage. They have
further directed me to move that the consideration
of the bill be postponed to next Monday week, the
twentieth instant, and that it be made the special
order for that day.
Mr. DAWSON. I desire the Senator from
Wisconsin to oblige me by extending the time
which he has designated for the consideration of
this bill to a more distant day. Circumstances
make it necessary for both the Senators from
Georgia to be absent for a short time, and I desire
to be here when the bill comes up for action.
Mr. WALKER. Permit me to say to the
Senator that if the bill be taken up on the day
which I have named, by direction of the Commit-
tee on Public Lands, I have no idea that final ac-
tion will be had upon it before the Senator returns.
He will have ample time to participate in the dis-
cussion and disposition of this bill.
Mr. DAWSON. The honorable Senator's ex-
planation is perfectly satisfactory.
The motion was agreed to.
JAMES ROBERTSON.
Mr. EVANS. Mr. President, some days ago
one of the Senators from Mississippi presented a
petition of one James Robertson, who alleges
that he has laige claims upon this body, by way
of compensation for injuries which he sustained
by reason of an imprisonment of him by order of
the Senate, as he says. The imprisonment was
by the officers of the Senate, but it does not ap-
pear that it was by order of the Senate. The
Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent
Expenses of the Senate have had that matter un-
der consideration, and have directed me to present
an adverse report. This is a subject which has
twice before been considered by the committees
of the Senate, and the previous reports are ap-
pended to and constitute a part of the report now-
made. I move that the report which I now pre-
sent be printed; but I do not think it is necessary
to print the former reports, as they are probably
within the knowledge of most members, and are
to be found in the books containing the proceed-
ings of the Senate. I have myself a printed copy
of them. I present the report, and move that it
he printed.
The motion was agreed to.
"WILLIAM MAYO.
Mr. JONES, of Iowa. I am instructed by the
Committee on Pensions to report back without
amendment, and recommend the passage of, the
bill from the House of Representatives for the
relief of William Mayo, of Belfast, Maine.
I wish also to ask the unanimous consent of the
Senate to have the bill considered now.
There being no objection, the Senate proceeded
to consider the bill as in Committee of the Whole.
It proposes to direct the Secretary of the Interior
to increase William Mayo's pension three dollars
per month, so as to make it eight dollars per
month, during his natural life, from the 1st of
January, 1S54.
Mr. JONES, of Iowa. Let the report of the
committee be read.
Mr. HAMLIN. I can state the facts of the
case sooner than the Clerk can read the report.
Several Senators. There is no objection to
the bill.
Mr. HAMLIN. Then it is not necessary to
make any explanation.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading, was read a third time, and passed.
ARKANSAS JUDICIAL DISTRICTS.

ate, as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
