That the Treasury Department has kindly granted the use of the Marine Hospital for the use of army patients, and the great need for hospital accommodations at Louisville at the present time requires that this permission be availed of. But it does not follow nor does there seem to by any reason for requiring that the patients already in the building belonging to the class for which the hospital was constructed should be removed, and, therefore, the views indorsed upon the first of these letters by Dr. Colescott are approved. You will consequently instruct the medical director at Louisville to occupy only such part of the Marine Hospital as can be spared from its legitimate purposes, and you will authorize the use by the medical department, for the sick and wounded of the army, of such buildings in Louisville as may be needed, belonging to disloyal persons in the rebel service, and as may be adapted to hospital purposes. You will also call upon the medical director to report the reasons for requiring authorities of the Marine Hospital to vacate the building for the purposes of an army hospital.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brig. General GEORGE W. MORGAN,

Remain with your command at Gallipolis or Point Pleasant till further orders. Certain reported movements in Western Virginia make this important, though I do not fully credit them.

Gov. OLIVER P. MORTON, Indianapolis, Ind.:

There are six companies Fourth Indiana Cavalry in Kentucky. When can other companies be ready for the field? There are also two companies of the Fifth Indiana Cavalry in Kentucky. If this regiment is not included in the order of General Halleck for troops to be sent to Memphis, I would like to have it, as cavalry is much needed in Kentucky. When can it be ready? Please answer.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
