The enemy's cavalry have moved toward our left and disappeared from our view. A battery to the right of me was the cause of the movement.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 9, 1864. [Received 5.40 p.m.]

Major-General WARREN:

Hancock has pushed across the creek in his front, on your right, and is now about to advance his whole corps in the direction of Block house. I wish you would push your skirmishers out and feel if the enemy are in force.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.

MAY 9, 1864-6.15 p.m.

General MEADE:

I have obeyed an order brought by Major Mitchell to General Crawford, to connect my line of battle with Gibbon, and I have done so. I think, however, that a skirmish line was sufficient connection, as it is on a line perpendicular to my line of battle and looks out on the wide open meadow, where there is no enemy. I think there is some mistake about it, and hesitate to do it.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

[NOTE IN PENCIL.]-Dispatch to advance pickets received at 5.50 p.m. Order given at once.
