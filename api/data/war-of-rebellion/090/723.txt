HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., August 7, 1864-5.45 p. m.

His Excellency A. LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

In sending the rebel citizens and their families beyond our lines I was obeying the order* of Lieutenant-General Grant, communicated through General Halleck, your Chief of Staff. With several thousand wealthy rebel spies in our midst, constantly sending information and supplies to the enemy, and pointing out Union men to their vengeance, it is impossible to conduct the affairs of any department successfully. I must humbly beg that I may be relieved from command of the Department of West Virginia.

D. HUNTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,Washington, D. C., August 1864.

Major-General HUNTER,

General Grant directs that Brigadier-General Howe and staff return to Washington and report to General Augur. Please order accordingly.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
