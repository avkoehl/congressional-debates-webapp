General E. B. BROWN,

Warrensburg;

Stage and passengers robbed between here and Kansas City this morning. They took four horses from us. Are we going to have protection or not? We want more troops here. If something is not done I shall stop all our mails in this district and move my stock out of it.

P. ROBERTS,

Independence:

The troops are all engaged in the field. I cannot prevent the stage or people being robbed at times. It would probably be as well to stop the regular running of the stages at present; and if you do not I shall be compelled to make an order to that effect.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

BOONVILLE, July 14, 1864.

General BROWN,

Bushwhackers in considerable force north and south of Boonville. Send us one company of troops immediately.
