Agricultural Colleges—Mr. Morrill.

than satisfy all demands, whether of the hardy
pi( j neororthe velvet-footed speculator. Our bounty
has proven a deluge rather fhan a refreshing-
shower. All markets have been glutted, until
these Government largesses, sweated and con-
sumed by their own reeking fatness, have shrunk
to less than half of their original value, and in part
now remain, having conferred benefits only by
halves, to clog the opeiations of Government in
its hour of largest beneficence and laigest need.
The Government price for land, except to ac-
tual settlers for five years, is now 25 per acre,
and if it were five dollars per acre it would be no
dearer than $2 50 was twenty years ago to the set-
tlers of Indiana and Illinois, and cheaper than any
other land of equal value now to be had under the
most enlightened and liberal Government of the
world. Even in Australasia, where they sell land at
auction for all it will bring, the upset price in the
poorest colonies has been not less than one pound
sterling or about five dollars, and then what more
they can get, while the best lands and those within
three miles of any town are held much higher. To
the 500,000 farmers in France, who own upon an
average but seven acres each, §1 25 per acre must
appear a bagatelle, and to the Irish farmers who
in some rare localities pay <£10 to <£30 (or #50 to
$150) rent per acre, it must look like a bull or the
p&i t of Biother Jonathan.
Those who have given this sulgject that atten-
tion it deserves, know settlement has already ap-
proached the limits of most of the profitable farm-
ing lands within our domain. Some of the lands
are fertile, but destitute of wood or of water. The
red man stilt wanders on the verge, and where he
has disappeared the prairie wolf remains at least
to frighten sheep. With some good, there is much
poor land in our western Territories. An acre may
be worth the Governmentprice, provided there is
a dozen prairie chickens upon it! In the new
States there is much land yet to be had of great
value at very low prices, but comparatively little
of this remains in the hands of Government. In
our Territories the fertile lands are not found to
be universal, as they were nearly so in Illinois
and Iowa, but they lie in parcels—here a little and
there a little—eittbroidenngthelnarginsofstreams,
and standing forth in greater beauty from the rule
of contrast—oases in the deserts.
There were, September 30, 18G1, of surveyed
public lands 134,218,330 acres, the unsurvcycd
being many times greater. Of these lands it is
proposed to donate to the States for these colleges,
if all should accept the conditions, about 9,000,000
acres, or 6,000,000, if only the loyal States should
be able to avail themselves of the grant. It is an in-
considerable grant in proportion to our means, and
not a large one in proportion to the object in view.
We have now abandoned the public lands as capi-
tal ,\v ith the design ofderiving a larger revenue from
those who may settle upon them and make thorn
fruitful. And here these land colleges come in to aid
in the plan of improving, not only the new lands,
but also the old, and thereby extending the basis
of taxation and revenue. A tract of land to a man
who knows how to make it a real homestead, with
all its train of joys, is a blessing; but to all others
it is at best a bauble, and often a curse. To give
all men an opportunity by their own labor to ob-
tain a substantial support is a pioOlem most Gov-
ernments endeavor to solve. We have a higher
and possibly more difficult task, which is to com-
bine the largest freedom with the largest rewards
of labor—free government and personal independ-
ence—and this can only be' done by the largest
knowledge. Success in working out this problem
secures the immortality of our Republic. The
man who earns but fifty cents a day cannot be
taxed one fourth part of it, or twelve and a half
cents, without starving his children; but let him
earn two dollars a day and he will pay double the
amount, or twenty-five cents, and not only sur-
vive it, but ask the tax gatherer to stop and dine!
The policy of the Government towards the Ter-
ritories and the new States has been liberal, as it
deserves to be; but I think few who have not read
the repoit of the Secretary of the Interior are
aware of the extent of that liberality. Within the
last four years there have been granted to^ States
and Territories,and reserved from sale, 49,754,606
acres. Each new State now has university lands,
Bait-spring lands, public building lands, and
New Series—No. 17.
500,000 acres each, under the act of 1841. One
eighteenth part of all the lands are also at once
given to the now States for schools. We have
given them, up to 1861, 9,998,497 acres for rail-
roads. Then we have surrendered all the swamp
lands, amounting within the past four years to
3,910,310 acres; and the entire claims of the sev-
eral States under this head amount to 57,895,577
acres. Added to all this, we give the land States
five per cent, on all sales of land .within their bor-
ders after they are admitted as States. This is
not treating these States as step-children. The
four States of California, Minnesota, Oregon, and
Kansas are entitled to 15,G32,G35 acres for school
purposes alone. Beyond all we have passed the
homestead law.
All the bounty land warrants and scrip issued
under different acts of Congress embrace an ag-
gregate of 71,717,172 acres. Of this amount, all
the warrants have been located except 7,454,720
acres. If the present bill should pass, it would
only about double the quantity now afloat, and
scarcely exceed the amount allotted to some sin-
gle States. The total amount of unsold and un-
appropriated lands is 1,046,290,093 acres; and,
after deducting the proposed donation to these
colleges, we could quadruple the amount and still
retain over 1,000,000,000 acres to be disposed of
under the homestead act. Not so much as one
per cent, will be abstracted.
This heritage may be so heedlessly overrun as
to be soon wasted, leaving behind nothing but the
estate of a prodigal, or it may be so managed as
to hold all comers and give them unsurpassed
prosperity for centuries.
As soon as lands pass from the hands of the
Government tlicy become subject to local taxa-
tion, and that is clearly to be desired by land
States and Territories. The scrip issued will go
into the hands of bona fide settlers, because such
will be the only purchasei.s to be found, unless at
a depreciation of price, and these will be obtained
by the several Status disposing of their scrip on
a credit and reLaming the1 hen an the land. Such
an arrangement will not certainly be to the disad-
vantage of the land States.
Saying nothing of what might be due from the
new "States to the old on the score of leciplocttl
generosity, by the present bill the land States will
obtain their just propoition according to popula-
tion, and it is not too much tu say at, the same time
that more young men will be beneficiaries of these
institutions in the other States who will become
residenis of than will be educated by the land
States themselves. These States, therefoie, should
be more deeply interested in the measure than all
others, and I invoke their Representatives to its
just appreciation.
In a speech I had .the honor to make in this
I-Iouso (Apul 20, 1858,) ptiur to the passage of
the bill of which this is mainly a copy, I attempted
to show, by the facts of the consus of 1850, com-
pared with those of 1840, including other State
returns, that there was a constant and widely per-
vading diminution of crops per acre under out-
go-ahead system of farming, and that the mam
relief sought was such as that practiced by flocks
of wild pigeons, which no sooner strip and waste
one field than they take wing and fly further on.
If this deduction has any foundation, without
some speedy and efficient remedy—reaching to
every State, for there are none without more or
less of lean-faced districts, poor farms,and poorer
farmers—this agricultuial decline will, at no re-
mote time in the age of the nation, produce ca-
lamitous results. The census of 1800 is not yet
published, so that a full comparison of another
decennial period is impracticable, and, if the latest
census tables were now at hand, the statistical
infoimation is too limited toaffoid moie than a
meager account of what it would be useful, if not
creditable, for us as a people to know and to spread
out on the record. By the courtesy of the Super-
intendent I have gleaned some facts which still
indicate, I regret to say, the retrograde march of
agriculture, and showing that the positions here-
tofore assumed have only too much support in
the census of 1860. The facts are by no means
agreeable—not calculated to puff us up with pride
—but they should be resolutely examined to And,
if possible, adequate measures of reparation predi-
cated upon the wants of all the States.
, By the returns it appears the New England
States have increased their number of horses,
but to about the same extent have diminished
the number of oxen, and it would be hard to say
whether the gain or loss is the most profitless. Ail
of these States, except Rhode Island, have in-
creased the product of butter, and all fall oft' in
the quantity of cheese, as well as the number of
sheep, swine, and (except Maine and Vermont)
in the quantity of potatoes. Of wheat, the whole
quantity produced is pitiably small, being only
1,077,285 bushels, and of that 431,127 bushels is
produced in Vermont. New York, in 1850, pro-
duced 13,121,448 bushels of wheat, and only
8,681,100 bushels in 1860, showing a decrease of
4,440,348 bushels. The number of sheen in New

TJiis state has nearly 2,000,000 acres or one
seventh part more land under cultivation than
there was ten years ago, and yet the hay crop
was less by 164,011 tons. The following table

This is anything but complimentary to our sys-
tem of agriculture, and yet few of the old States
are doing so well as New York.
In seventeen of the States—nearly all the old—
there has been a loss in the number of sheep,
and the number in i860 is 22,679,386, against
21,723,220 in 1850, or again only of 956,160 m
ten yeaus ! Hut for (he n< w States the loss would
have been large, and lite gain in the State of Cali-
fornia (l,0f>rt,134) is more than equal to that of
the whole Union.
Pennsylvania, with 46,000 square miles of ter-
ritory, and 2,^06,1 15 people, should raise as
many sheep as England, with about 51,000 sqtuue
miles of territory, and 17,000,000 people,and yet
England lias 30,000,000 sheep, and Pennsylva-
nia hut 1,631,540, which give* to England neaily
two sheep foi every inhabitant, and 590 for cveiy
square mile, while Pennsylvania has little moie
than one to every two inhabitants, and only 35 to
the square mile. With our unlimited cheap lands,
we should export millions of woo!, but England
nt fact has, the past year, supplied us with mil-
lions both of the raw and manufactured.
Flax and hemp, as crops, have nearly been
blotted out of the Union, though considerable
/lax seed is still raised, to be crushed for the oil,
while the fiber, the most valuable part, is thrown
away. Home manufactures, in 1850. amounted
to #27,4^6,219, but m 1860 they declined to
#24,326,741; so that women, in this branch of in-
dustry so intimately teluted to agriculture, not-
withstanding the 4,000,000 more of women,are
really toiling and spinning less than ten years ago,
and but little mote than thu^ appear to have done
according to the statistical information recorded
in the days of King Solomon.
The loss in the "hog crop" in many of the
States is considerable, and not compensated even
by whisky. Six States "(Maine, Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, and
Vermont) produce less corn than they did ten
years ago. The old States exhibit little increase
of corn—scarcely equaling the marvelous growth
of some single new State.
X have been furnished with the Ohio annual
agricultural reports, containing statistical returns
of that State—so creditable in matter and form
that they deserve to be the model for her sister
States—and these corroborate the positions as-
sumed, that is to say, the fact of the increasing
unproductiveness of our long cultivated lands.
Ohio is a fair State to put on to the witness stand.
She is wise, biave, and rich enough to couit the
test} to declare the whole truth, in ordei to find a
cure for any defects in time. This annual self-
inspection—not less useful to States than to per-
sons—discloses the real deficiencies, and all that
is then needed is proper instruction as to the rem-
