ton in reference to the subject to-morrow or next day. In the meantime, if my information is at all correct, vigorous measures should at once be taken.

WASHINGTON, D. C., October 17, 1864.

Governor A. G. CURTIN,

Harrisburg, Pa.:

Your information is erroneous. No part of Sheridan's force has left him, except by expiration of terms of service. I think there is not much danger of a raid into Pennsylvania.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Fort Monroe:

General Sheridan, who came to-day to see General Halleck, reported to me personally that the rebel army-lately under Early, but now apparently under Longstreet-having appeared in the vicinity of Strasburg, his forces moved to attack them on Saturday. Crook, who had the advance, found the rebels drawn up in four lines of battle, but upon his charging them they broke and withdrew in disorder, without giving opportunity for serious conflict. Sheridan thinks they are retreating again up the Valley.

C. A. DANA.

WASHINGTON, October 17, 1864-12.30 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

General Sheridan has just been here. He has not yet fully decided about the Manassas road, but will do so in a day or two. He has gone back, with Colonels Alexander and Thom, to make a fuller reconnaissance. Thomas thinks Sherman's movements favorable for cutting off Hood. Nothing whatever from General Rosecrans.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

RECTORTOWN, VA., October 17, 1864.

(Received 2 p.m.)

Colonel TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff:

There is a rumor here that Mosby is collecting his force beyond MIddleburg for a raid into Maryland. Inform Ludlam, and give him such force as you can to meet it.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.
