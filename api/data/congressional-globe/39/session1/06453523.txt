to be read a third time. It was read the third
time and passed.
Mr. CONNESS. I move to amend the title
of the bill by adding the words, " and the town
of Santa Cruz, in the^jStateof California."
The amendment was agreed to.
CHARLES BREWER AND COMPANY.
Mr. CHANDLER. I move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of House bill
No. 555.
The motion -was agreed to; and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
consider the bill (H. R No. 555) for the relief
of Charles Brewer & Co. It directs the pay-
ment to Charles Brewer & Co., of Boston, of
the sum of ยง3,530, in full for the passage, on
the Hawaiian bark Kamahamaha V, of sixty-
eight destitute American seamen belonging to
American vessels which were burned by the
Anglo-confederate pirate Shenandoah, from the
the island of Ascension to Honolulu.
The Committee on Commerce reported an
amendment to the bill, which was after the
word "Boston," in line four, to insert "in
coin."
Mr. CLARK. It seems to me that amend-
ment is a very singular one. I do not know
that we have ever undertaken to pay private
claims in coin before. I should like to hear
something as to the necessity of it.
Mr. CHANDLER. This is for the transpor-
tation of our sailors frqm a desert island where
they were left by the rebel pirate Shenandoah.
The ship in which they were transported be-
longed to a subject of the Hawaiian Govern-
ment, and of course coin is the only thing that
is used there ; our currency is not known there.
We pay the same rate precisely that the Ha-
waiian Government paid for the bringing of
their own subjects to the Sandwich Islands at
the same tim'e, and it was deemed by the com-
mittee right and just and proper that the claim
should be paid in coin rather than in the cur-
rency of this country.
Mr. CLARK. But these people are of Bos-
ton.
Mr. CHANDLER. The parties named in
th<S bill are simply agents. The owner of the
ship is a subject of the Hawaiian Government.
Charles Brewer & Co. are simply agents for the
collection of the claim.
Mr. CLA UK. I suppose the shipping is all
owned in Boston ; these people are the real
owners; and it seems to me this is a new case.
I think if the amount of the bill is not suffi-
cient in currency, it had better be made so in
currency, and not be paid in coin in this way.
It is the first instance I have ever known where
a private claim was proposed to be paid in coin.
Mr. CHANDLER. We pay all our consuls
and diplomatic agents in coin. All money that
we expend abroad out of this country is paid
in coin.
Mr. CLARK. That is a. matter of salaries
when we provide for people abroad; but here
we are proposing to pay a private claim to peo-
ple of our own country, and it seems to me they
ought to be satisfied with the currency in which
wej ay all other citizens here.
Hr. CHANDLER. The money is not to go
to citizens of our own country. The citizens
of our own country named here arc simply
agents to collect the claim for a subject of his
Majesty the King of the Sandwich Islands.
Mr. CLARK. The bill says on its face that
it is to pay a house in Boston.
Mr. CHANDLER. They are the agents to
collect the claim.
Mr. CLARK. If they are agents and other
parties are the principals, what right have they
here? They should come through the State
Department.
Mr. CHANDLER. This came from the State
Department to the Committee on Commerce.
Mr. CLARK. Recommended by the State
Department to be paid?
Mr. CHANDLER. Yes, sir.
Mr. CLARK. I still think it should he paid
in the currency of the country. I am opposed
to the amondment.
Mr. CHANDLER. It is for the Senate to
say whether they will repudiate fifty per cent,
of an honest and just debt. I think the amount
is thirty dollars for the transportation of each
of these men from a desert island where they
were left by the rebel pirate Shenandoah. This
Sandwich Island vessel was sent to that island
to bring off some subjects of the Sandwich Isl-
ands who were left there, and they took our
abandoned sailors and carried thcin to the
Sandwich Islands. We are to pay precisely
the same price, not a cent more nor less, as
was paid by the Government of th_e Sandwich
Islands, m coin, for the transportation of their
own subjects.
Mr. SUMNER. Where is this money to be
paid?
Mr. CHANDLER. Itistobe paid to Charles
Brewer & Co., of Boston,who are simply agents
for the collection of the claim.
Mr. CLARK. The point is this, that we
ought not to appropriate money in coin to pay
our own people. If this bill is not large enough
in currency let the Committee on Commerce
take it and fix the proper sum, and not bring
it in here for a given sum and afterward move
an amendment providing for.paying it in coin.
I think we should pay all our citizens in the
currency of the country and make no distinc-
tion in that regard. I wish the bill to be re-
committed or lie over until the committee can
make an estimate how much is, in currency,
the proper sum and have the claim paid in that
way.
Mr. CHANDLER. There is just one way
to pay it, and that is to pay it in money.
Mr. GRIMES. I call for the reading of the
communication made by the State Department
to the Senate on this subject.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The doc-
ument alluded to, if in the possession of the
Senate, will be read.
Mr. SUMNER. While the Secretary is find-
ing that document permit me to remark 
Mr. CLARK. Let the bill lie over to be
examined.
Mr. CHANDLER. No; it has been before
us for four months.
The PRESIDENTpro tempore. The Chair
is advised that there arc no papers accompany-
ing the bill.
Mr. SUMNER. If the claim is to be paid
at all, it ought to be fully paid. Now, as I
understand it, the payment in currency is not
a full payment.
Mr. CHANDLER. No; fifty per cent. less.
Mr. SUMNER. The expenditure was in
coin, and we are to make the party good.
Mr. CHANDLER. Certainly.
Mr. SUMNER. I see no way in which we
can make him good except by coin. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire says make a calcu-
lation in currency; but can we do that? Sup-
pose you had made your calculation three weeks
ago, you would have made it on the basis of
thirty per cent, advance, thirty per cent, as the
value of the exchange. If you make it now,
you must make it on the basis of fifty or sixty
per cent. What will it be next week, or what
will it bo a month from now, when this pay-
ment may be consummated? Nobody can tell.
I say, therefore, the direct practical way is to
make it payable in coin. That fixes it abso-
lutely.
Mr. GRIMES. I think it is very certain that
at any rate we ought to have something upon
the record here, in the shape of a report from
the committee or a communication from the
State Department on this subject, before we
proceed to act upon the bill, because upon the
face of the transaction, as it appears before us
to-day, this is a mere payment of a claim to citi-
zens of the United States, in coin, for the trans-
portation of persons upon the Hawaiiau bark
Kamahama V. That is the mere designa-
tion of the vessel. That Hawaiian bark was
owned by citizens of the United States or was
chartered by them.
Mr. CHANDLER. No, sir; neither owned
nor chartered by them. It was owned by a
subject of the Hawaiian Government, and these
citizens of the United States are merely agents
to collect the claim.
Mr. GRIMES. Does it not strike the Sena-
tor from Michigan as being very important,
then, that there should be something on the
record here to show that Charles Brewer &
Co. are authorized to receive and receipt for
this money? Why do we make the payment
to Charles Brewer & Co., as being the princi-
pals, apparently, on the face of the bill? If
they are entitled to this money I want them
paid. If they are citizens of Honolulu or any
one of the Sandwich Islands group let them
be paid in coin, but let us not establish a pre-
cedent hero which will be inconvenient to us
in the future. So far as the record shows,
Charles Brewer & Co. are citizens of Boston,
in the State of Massachusetts, without being
the agents of anybody; and we propose to pay
them, as the principals in this transaction, in
coin. I move that the bill either lie upon the
table or be recommitted to the committee, to
let it be accompanied with a report. If the
facts be as stated by the Senator from Michi-
gan, and we have a record that will govern us
in the future, that will be printed and laid
upon our tables, I am for paying the claim.
Mr. CHANDLER. I of course have no in-
terest in this matter. The bill was before the
Committee on Commerce, and was carefully
considered. Itis needless to refer it back to the
Committee on Commerce. If it is to lie over
I suggest that it be referred either to the Com-
mittee on Claims or to the Committee on Naval
Affairs, or I will name the two jointly, and
move that it be referred to the Committee on
Claims and the Committee on Naval Affairs,
and that tlicy be directed to bring in a report.
Mr. GRIMES. I will only say that no such
claim as that lias ever passed the Committee
on Naval Affairs in the. last six years.
Mr. CHANDLER. Nor any other that I
know of.
Mr. CLARK. I made the remark some little
time ago that it would be well that this should
go through the State Department, and the Sen-
ator from Michigan said it had been through
the State Department.
Mr. CHANDLER. It came to the Com-
mittee on Commerce from the State Depart-
ment.
Mr. CLARK. I am not contradicting what
the Senator says. On a call for the infor-
mation from the State Department at the tabie
it was not to be found. Now, is it. not reason-
able that the bill should lie over until we can
see what is the communication from the State
Department? ' That is all I desire. I have no
desire that it shall go to the Committee on
Claims separately or conjointly with any other
committee. Neither have I any desire to delay
the passage of a proper bill. I only desire time
to look into it, and see that we do not pay
some of our own citizens in coin when we are
paying other people in currency. Let it lie
over, and we will try to see how it is. I move
that the bill be postponed until to-morrow.
The motion was agreed to.
RAILROADS IN' MINNESOTA.
Mr. STEWART. There are two hills on the
table, which were reported originally by the
Committee on Public Lands, that have been
returned from the House of Representatives
with some slight amendments, and I wish to
take them up for the purpose of concurring in
those amendments. I move to takevup the
House amendments to the bill (S. No. 150)
making an additional grant of iands to the
State of Minnesota, in alternate sections, to aid
in the construction of a railroad in said State.
โข The motion was agreed to. The amend-
ments of the House of Representatives were
read. They were to strike out from the begin-
ning of the fourth line of the first section to and
including the word "State," in line nine, and
to insert in lieu of the words stricken out " the
purpose of aiding in the construction of a rail-
road from Houston, through the counties of
Fillmore, Mower, Freeborn, and Faribault, to
the western boundary of the State; anil also
