We close the Congressional Globe and Appendix for this session by informing our subscribers
that we shall print them during the next session; and, as it will be a long session, the price will be
82 for each—that is, 82 for the Congressional Globe and 82 for the Appendix, making 84 for both.
We will send five copies of each, directed to as many as five different persons, for 815, if all shall be
remitted to us in one letter, free of postage.
We again request subscribers to send in their orders as early as the first week of the session, else
they may not get all the numbers.
BLAIR & RIVES.
