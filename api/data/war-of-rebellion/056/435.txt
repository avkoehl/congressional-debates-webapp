GENERAL: Since writing you last I have received instructions from General Parke requiring you to move up to Nance's Ford on the Holston. You will please to execute this movements without delay.

Commanding U. S. Forces, Blain's Cross-Roads:

GENERAL: The guide you sent me I have sent to cross the brigade at McKinney's Ford at daybreak, at once if river is rising, and join me on the road to Nance's Ford. I leave at daybreak to-morrow.
