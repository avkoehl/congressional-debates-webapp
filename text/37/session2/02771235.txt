HOUSE BILL REFERRED.
The joint resolution from the House of Repre-
sentatives (No. 52) tendering the thanks of Con-
gress to Brigadier General Curtis and the officers
and men under his command, was read twice by
its title, and referred to the Committee on Military
Affairs and the Militia.
ASSISTANT TREASURER AT BOSTON.
The bill (H. R. No. 353) to provide for the ap-
pointment of clerks in the office of the Assistant
Treasurer at Boston, to fix their salaries, and pro-
vide for the absence of the Assistant Treasurer,
and for other purposes, was read twice by its
title.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I should like to have that
bill passed. It merely provides for the reorgani-
zation of the office, and makes no additional ap-
propriations.
There being no objection, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to consider
the bill. It authorizes the Assistant Treasurer at
Boston, from and after the 1st of July, 186*2, m
lieu of the clerks heretofore authorized and pro-
vided, to appoint, with the approbation of the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, one chief cleik,ata salary
of $1,500 per annum; one disbursing clerk, at a
salary of $1,500 per annum; and one other clerk, at
a salary of $1,200 per annum; and one messenger,
at a salary of ยง700 per annum; and it appropri-
ates a sunt sufficient to pay the compensation of
such clerks foi the current and next fiscal year.
In case of the sickness or unavoidable absence of
the Assistant Treasurer, he may, in his discre-
tion, authorize the chief clerk to act in his place,
and to discharge all the duties required by law of
the Assistant Treasurer.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I stated to the Senate that
the bill made no appropriation. I find that it does.
Let it lie over until Monday morning, and I will
look into it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Does the Senator
move to lefin* it to a committee?
Mr. FESSENDEN. No, sir; let itlie over for
the present.
Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts. I under-
stand that it saves $1,200 from the expenses as
they now exist,
Mr. FESSENDEN. We made an appropria-
tion in the appropriation bill for these clerks in
the Assistant Treasurer's office in Boston, and
this bill makes an appropriation also.
Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts. I cannot
say now how that is; but I learn that it will save
$200 in the expenses of the office.
Mr. FESSENDEN. There is really no objec-
tion to the bill, except that it makes an appropri-
ation which I thought it did not. Let it lie over
until Monday morning.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It cannot be read
a third time to-day if objected to by any Senator,
and it will lie over.
EXECUTIVE SESSION.
Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts. I move that
the Senate proceed to the consideration of execu-
tive business I will say before the motion is put,
that it is for a single object that is pressed upon
us as of great importance to the public service.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate pro-
ceeded to the consideration of executive business;
and after some time spent therein, the doors were
reopened, and the Senate adjourned.

by the Chaplain, Rev. Thomas H. Stockton.
The Journal of yesterday was read and approved.

of business was the call of committees for reports
of a private character.
Mr. ELIOT. I ask the unanimous consent of
the House that the bills and resolutions upon the
Speaker's table be taken up, and referred to the
appropriate committees.
There being no objection, the following bills
and joint resolutions were taken up and disposed
of as indicated below.
COTTON LANDS.
A bill (S. No. 201) to provide for the occupa-
tion and cultivation of the cotton and other lands
m possession of the United States, lying along the
southern coast of the United States, was read a
firs I and second time, and referred to the Commit-
tee on Agriculture.
PAY AND EMOLUMENTS OP ARMY OFFICERS.
A bill (S. No. 175) to define the pay and emol-
uments of certain officers of the Army, and for
other purposes, was read a first and second time,

EXPENSES OF PUBLIC LANDS.
A bill (S. No. 187) to reduce the expenses of

THANKS TO CAPTAIN FOOTE.
Joint resolution (S. No. 64) expressive of the
thanks of Congress to Captain A. H. Foote, of
the United States Navy, and to the officers and
men under his command in the western flotilla,
was read a first and second time by its title.
Mt. SEDGWICK. I ask the unanimous con-
sent of the House to put that resolution upon its
passage.
The joint resolution was read, and is as follows:
Be it i esolvetf ly the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United Statesof Jhnerica in Congress assembled, That
the thanks of t'otigicss and of the Amcuean people aie due,
and aie hereby tendered, to Captain A II. Foote, of the
United States Navy, and to the offieeiv and men of the west-
ern fiotiila undei his command, t<u the great aallanny
exhibited by them m the attacks upon Fort* Hem j and Don-
el&on. lor their efficiency in opening the Tennessee, Cum-
berland, and Mississippi nvers to the puisuits of lawful
commetce, and for their unwawung devotion to the cause
of tiie country m the midst of the greatest difficulties and
dangei <
si.o. 2. *$nd he it further resolved, That the Piesident of
the United States be requested to e.ius>e this resolution to
be communicated to Captain Foote, and through him to the
officer and men undei his command.
Mr. SEDGWICK. Mr. Speaker, the reason
why I desire the passage of this joint resolution
is this: at half pasteleven o'clock lastnight Com- j
modore Foote telegraphed that he would, this j
morning, move his boats to the attack on Island j
No. 10 and New Madrid. He expresses some I
confidence as to his being able to succeed; bathe
does not underrate the dangers which attend "that
expedition. It is possible that it may fail; 1 hope
it may succeed. But probably, at this very hour,
while this resolution is under consideration,; hi?
boats are thundering on the fortifications on Island
No. 10. If he should fall, his heirs will treasure
up with grateful memory the thanks voted to him
in Congress to-day. I hope that the resolution
will pass unanimously.
The joint resolution was read the third time, and
passed unanimously. , . . -
VOTE OF THANKS TO LIEUTENANT WOBBUN.

constructing a railroad and telegraph line from
the Missouri river to the Pacific ocean, and to se-
cure to the Government the use of the same for
postal, military, and other purposes, and asked
that it be made a special order for Tuesday week,
