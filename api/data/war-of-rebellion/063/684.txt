Colonel W. F. GEIGER,

Have received your dispatch that your pickets are attacked. Do you want help? Does the enemy how in force? I sent a small train from here half an hour ago, with 100 men, to see what was the matter. If you want help, I must have one of the two trains back. If your picket affair is a trifle, send the train with the rations immediately. captain Carr's orders have been given under a misunderstanding, and I take the responsibility of ordering the train here.
