FORT LEAVENWORTH, August 24, 1864.

Brigadier-General McKEAN,

Paola, Kans.:

You are ordered to report to General Canby. Order will go to you by mail to-morrow. This is an unofficial notice.

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

OMAHA, August 24, 1864.

Brigadier General ROBERT B. MITCHELL,

Fort Kearny, Nebr. Ter.:

Governor Saunders wrote you to-day about Talbot. Thinks he will have to put him in Company A. The militia company that went from here to-day is merely going to the Junction Island. The Governor says he will try and raise companies here to send out to you, but I do not believe one single man will be raised in Omaha unless he positively orders them out. He says the detachment sent to-day was not a regular company, but merely a scout sent to mouth of Elkhorn, in compliance with suggestions of General Curtis. All work has been suspended here for two days, and has stopped horse-buying and your mess-chest. I think it will turn out to be spasmodic and will not result in healthy, effective organization, it being the result of a scare that was of doubtful foundation.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

OMAHA, August 24, 1864.

Brigadier General ROBERT B. MITCHELL,

Fort Kearny:

A company militia, forty-three men, left here this morning. If you can send word to me that you want them to report at some point the Governor will, and they can be held, order them there; otherwise they will make a useless march and return. Please answer.

JNO. PRATT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

OMAHA, August 24, 1864.

Brigadier General ROBERT B. MITCHELL,

Fort Kearny, Nebr. Ter.:

The Governor wishes to get some horse equipments to mount a militia company here. I have declined to order the issue, as I do not feel authorized to do so. The company numbers about sixty men, and they want fifteen or twenty sets equipments. The company is raised for a supposed emergency, and not under the Governor's four months' call. In compliance with request, I telegraphed to know if you desire the issue made. We have no more than we will want.

JNO. PRATT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
