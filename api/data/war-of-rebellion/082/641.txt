Lee's army, I think we have the greatest abundance of infantry and artillery there, but no cavalry to depend on. Order one division of Sheridan's cavalry to proceed at once ot City Point to embark for Washington. They need not take their transportation nor artillery with them until the cavalry is all embarked.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 30, 1864 - 10.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Orders in relation to cavalry received and transmitted to General Sheridan.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., July 30, 1864.

Major-General MEADE, Commanding, &amp;c.:

Get all the heavy artillery in the lines about Petersburg moved back to City Point as early as possible. It is by no means improbable the necessity will arise for sending two more corps there.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 30, 1864 - 10.45 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Do you mean City Point or Broadway, where it came from, for the siege artillery and mortars to go?

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.

JULY 30, 1864 - 11.15 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

General Grant left an hour ago for Fort Monroe. I presume he did not think of Broadway Landing when he wrote his dispatch. The artillery can be loaded on boats at City Point easier than at Broadway, but Colonel Abbot is at the latter place and would take charge of it. Please notify General Ord of the point you may determine as best in order that he may send his to the same place.

Respectfully,

T. S. BOWERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

JULY 30, 1864 - 11.25 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Hunt desires to know whether your order includes the siege guns on Ord's front and along the Appomattox River. I presume it does, but desire positive instructions.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
