tions from the lieutenant-general commanding, a pontoon train from the Army of the James was ordered up and a bridge thrown across the river for the artillery and trains. The infantry, crossing by the foot bridge, were encamped some time after dark, the trains and artillery getting into camp about midnight.

On Saturday, the 8th, orders to move at 5 a. m. were not received till 8 a. m., when the corps was at once put in motion and rapidly overtook the Second Corps. Instead of following this corps, the head of the column, at Major-General Humphreys' suggestion, was turned off on the plank road, which runs nearly parallel to and intersects at New Store the road followed by this corps. At New Store the corps camped for the night, after a march of about seventeen miles.

Starting at 5 a. m. on Sunday, the 9th, the Second Corps was soon overtaken and followed closely to the vicinity of Appomattox Court-House, where the troops were halted and held ready for any movement, awaiting the result of the conference then being held between Generals Grant and Lee. Soon after halting official intelligence of the surrender of General Lee's forces was announced to the army, and was received with great enthusiasm by the soldiers, who looked upon this as the result of all their privations, and as the virtual ending of the struggle which had convelused the country for four years, in which they had willingly rushed their lives and fortunes.

In the whole campaign I have been ably assisted by my staff, who, by their services, are entitled to the acknowledgments of the country; they are as follows: Major C. H. Whittelsey, assistant adjutant-general; Lieutenant Colonel Walter S. Franklin, assistant inspector-general; Majors Arthur McClellan, Richard F. Halsted, Thomas L. Haydn, and Henry W. Farrar, aides-de-camp; Lieutenant James W. Dixon, acting aide-de-camp; Major S. H. Manning, acting chief quartermaster; Major James K. Holman, medical director; Actg. Staff Surg. S. J. Allen, medical inspector; Major D. I. Miln, provost-marshal; Captain George E. Wood, ambulance officer; Major E. K. Russell, acting commissary of subsistence; Lieutenant Thomas H. Fearey, signal officer; Lieutenant Alex. Samuels, acting assistant quartermaster.*

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.

Colonel GEORGE D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac.
