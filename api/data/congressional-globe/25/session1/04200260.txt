260______________        APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.___________Sept. 1837.
*5m t/ONG....lst Sess.                             Postponement of jourlh instalment—Mr. Met cer.                                           H. of Reps.
States m the two houses of Congress, and the obli-
gation to rtstore them, when called lor, limited jn
me same ratio i each call confined to so small an
amount of the deposite, as not to exceed, in relation
to the most populous State in the Union $10,000 in
any month, unless with a further no'ice ol thirty one
days for eveiy additional sum of $30,000 tlm' might
be called for i No, sir, every provision ot this act
had reference to the benefit which the- several
States were to derive trom the use of the public
money, until required by the necessities oí the Gov -
eminent; necessities which,when the act v.aspaos
ed, no man anticipated.
Had the saiety of the public treasure, its value,
or the facility oí its use by this Government, been
the sole or even the chiei ends ot the deposite acf,
why did it not provide for the special deposite of
the entire surplus revenue, wheie the far greater
part of it had been collected, m tne injurious
vaults, and beneath the mai ble roofs ot the banks
of the great cities ol the noith, whence it could be
drawn on the shortest notice, by bills vendable at
par, or at a premium, w henevei the pub ic necessi-
ties might require its expenditure Has it been
for the security, or readiei use of the public de-
posites, that a considerable poriion of them has
been transferred to States on the Indian fiontier,
occasionally the seat of war, and a still larger por-
tion to States in the interior, within whose brails
scarcely a dollar of the public money is expende 1
in the year t
Sir, every featute of the deposite act, and all the
circumstances which preceded or accompanied its
enactment, demonstrate that it empoweied tin Sec-
retaiy of the Tieasury to enter into conflicts with
the several States ¡or the mutual advantage of the
parties, but especially for the benefit of the Slates
themselves
The deposite of the surplus money of this Gov-
ernment has ever been a subject of contract, either
express oi implied Such, m truth, Is ever special
oí genei il deposite in a bank, and loi forty of
the loity-eightyeais that oui piesent < onstmuion
litis been in luce, the unexpended revenue of this
Government has been the subject of special couti act
with a bank ol its o in cieaüon
On the temoval oí the deposites fiom the Bank
of the United States m 1833, formal articles of
agreement foi then safe-keeping, on specified con-
ditions, by the selected State banks, were drawn up
by the present Chief Justice, then Secietary of the
Treasury, and subsequently ratified, sealed -with
thp corporate seal, and siihscubed by the proper
officers of the State banks So valid -were the
obligations of these contracts regarded to be bv
that eminent lavyei, that he expressly stipulated
foi the right lo discharge the several banks 'tiom
the sen ire of the Government w henevei, in his
opinion, the public mteiest might leqtuie n "
In the veiv act winch we aie considering, the
7ih section pi ovules that it shall be lawful foi the
Secietaiy of the Treasury to enter into conhach m
Ike varar ami behalf of the United States with the
banks selected as depositories of the public money,
ind the terms of those conliacts are prescribed by
the act itself
Werethoseconlractsmadeforthemeiesafe keep-
ingof the public money1 Would the deposite banks
have accepted so barren and unpiofitable a trust,
connected as it was with an obligation, on  then
part, to give security for the administration of such
trust, to permit their books and account  to be m-
spectel, and then money to be counted bv the Scc-
iciaiy of the Treasury, or his ag-nl, to make
weekly íetnrns of their condition, subieet to pen-
odical publication, to pay, at sight, all wat rants
which the Treasurer might draw on  them   and
make all such transfers of the public money to
other banks, as he might require, and supply for-
eign bills of exchange, at cost, without any fee
piermum or commission whatev er , and, moreover'
a part of the expenses of such agents as the Secre-
tin f might depute to watch over the.r fidelity i
Would those banks, I say, have entered into obli-
gations so multiplied, embarrassing, and onerous
for the mere cie/ht of keeping the public money'
Without the iibertv to use it for the profit of then-
stockholders'!   Their contracts vv ilh the Treasury,
like that which th-> deposite act tenders to the
several States, are silent as to the u e which they
may make of the publu   deposite     The right to
use them might be implied from  the character of
the agent    But a letter from the 8=cielan of the
Treasury of the 26th  of Sep*ember, 183.1, to the
president oí the Girard Bank, contemporaneous m i
date with those contract , and designed to induce
their acceptai ce, avoids all necessity fot implica
lion, since it expressly intimates that the " depos-
ites of the public money w ill enable" the bank, to
which his letter was addressed, to " afford increas-
ed facilities to commeice, and to extend ttsuceom-
modations to individuals " ' As the duties payable
to the Government arise Irom the business and
enter puse of lie merchants engaged m foreign
irade, it is but reasonable,' Mr '1 aney adds,
"that they should be preferítd in the additional
accommodation," notch the public deposites will
enable the banks to give
A refcience to the v?st amount of the surplus
levenue, designed to be transfened by the aeposite
act, fiom the vanlts of the banks to tl c tieasuries
of the States, foi bids the belief, that t ie fnends of
that act, or the States who have complied with its
conditions, imagined, for a i iom°nl, that the sums
so transferred vv ere not to be u ed The sudden
withdrawal of moic thin thntv-seven millions
from the currency and business of a count] v, w hose
cuirency did not exceed, if it equalled, thuce that
amount, would have been a measure ot such
wanton m schief, that no man in his senses could
have given it his sanction, and it cannot be imput-
ed to tin verj large majority of both houses of
Congress, bv whose vole the act was passed  (/")
How the States have understood it.weaie not left
to conjecture, although I much íegret that the íeso-
lution of an honorable membei fiom Massachusetts,
(Mr Adams,) designed to piocure for this house
i cpies of the seveial acts of the State Legislatuies
accepting and disposing oí their respective share 
of the public deposites, remains yet unexecuted
Enough, however, has been told us by the Repre-
sentatives of those States, who have taken pait in
this debatí, to enable the committee to perceive
how they have construed the act of June, 1836, and
what inconvenience they must suffer fiom its par-
tial íepeal
Mr C ban mm, said Mr M , it w as my anticipa-
tion of the beneficent use which the seveial States
might make ot those deposites, which íecommended
to my favorable regaid the act oí 1S.3G I foiesaw
the noble purposes to which the public money might
be applied tlnough then agency, and my heart ex-
ulted in the glorious anticipation I saw the ties of
our happy Union multiplied and confhmed by the
improvement of old, and the opening new channels
of eommei cial and social intercom se I beheld the
spires of colleges, academies, and v lllage schools
gluteimg on the distant forest, and a wide-spread
system of popular education elevating om social
condition, augmenting the intelligence, refining the
man<er-., and ibove all implanting in the hearts of
oui people the knowledge and with it the love of
our admnable constitution of Government In or-
dei to avoid an Executive veto which had been
prepai ed, as I v\ as mfoi med, foi ihe act of a foi mer
Congress, to piov ide for the distribution ol the pro-
ceeds of the sales of oui public lands, I most re-
luctantly, and, as it eventuated, fruitlessly, assented
to stnke out the thiee limitations, which the Senate
had provided, of the use of the sums to be distri-
buted Popular education constituted one, and the
dearest of them all, in my conception I wish, Mr
Chairman, to behold a system for this object pei-
vading the Union But wherever it may exist, if
confined to one State or to a small distiict, I shall
hail it as an additional safeguard to the lights of
the people I leprcsent To them, my opinions heie
are not of more avail than those of any other mem
ber of this body, and the security of their freedom
and happiness rests upon that public sentiment to
which each member of this House i, amenable at
home, whethei he be fiom Maine or Geoigia, from
the shores of the Atlantic oi the banks of the Mis-
sissippi
We are apprized, Mr Chairman, that Noith
Carolina, Ohio and seveialothei States, have con
secrated their shaie of the public deposites to this
and other liberal pui poses, and mj reluctance to
pass the bill on your table i< augmented, m a ten-
fold degree, by this intelligence
We learn that other Sta'es have pnteied into
veu solemn engagements, founded upon an antici-
pation of the receipt of the instalment of those de-
posites which w e are now invited,by the Senate, to
withhold, or to postpone indefinitely Can we,'in
good lailh, withhold if* Let those gentlemen who
regard the deposite act as the promise of a mere
gntuity, ask themselves t¡ e question, whether they
would violate the sanctity of then word when once
>l had been plighted to the humblest individual m j.
society, to the beggar at their door'' What man
can do so, and retain the respect of his lellow men t
Who is piepared to set a price on the fanhful ob-
servance oi his word, and to commute his reputa-
tion for monev"> Let him come forth, and sustain
this bill
It ts objected to this appeal to the sentiment of
honoi, that no man tan bind himself to perform im-
possibilities , that mistake or unavoidable necessity
absolves us irom om obligation to the States, that
we have not the money to comply w ith oui engage-
ments, and the continued anility to do no was an
implied ingredient oí oui original contract or pro-
mise It is not pretended that the entile sum of
thirty seven millions was not in the Tieasury on
the 1st of January last, when the appropi nation look
effect—it is known and admitted that the total
amount subject to distribution, after leservmg five
millions foi the immediate necessities of the Gov-
ernment, exceeded innly-nine millions, a million
six bundled thousand dolíais having been subse-
quently reported to the Tieasuiei, by the distant
collectors and leceivers oí the public mone), to
have been m their hands on that day
Was it necessity which swelled, at the instance
of the Executive crgan of the Treasuiy, and the
majority of the last Congress, those excessive ap-
propriations which have caused oui present finan-
cial embaí rassments' We cannot plead a neces-
sity, cieated by outtehes, as the justification of a
breach oí faith
The States, it has been urged, had no right to
enter into engagements dependent on the receipt of
the instalments, pnot to then day of payment, and
the embarrassments, to winch then precipitancy
has exposed them, afford, it is said, no additional
claim upon the public fai'h
Could it have been designed, Mi Chairman, that
the States, who were to receive our deposites and
lo use them for the public benefit, should make no
piepaiatwnfor then use, prior to their reception''
The spun and the letter of the act which we are
construing foi bids anj such tonclnsion Timely
notice was given, bv i , lo the deposite banks, that
they were, at fixed periods, to suucndei up their
ti ust, and to the States, that the} were then to ester
upon it The verv instalment of the debt of the
banks to the Government, and the uses to which
they had applied the public money, with our know-
ledge and approbation, enjoined it upon them gra-
dually to piovide foi its withdrawal, and upon the
States to renew, as speedily as possible, its active
and beneficial employment. The gieatest injury
which either the banks or the States could have
done to the people at large, was to peirnit their
money to lie idle in the vaults of the one, oi the
Treasury oí the othei   (/)
If it be contended, that no use of the vast sum
committed to their custody should have been de-
vised by the States, inconsistent with then plighted
faith to return it to the Government when demand-
ed, I reply that the law itself, as well as the known
intention of those who enacted it guarded the
Slates from any such demand The fai greater
part of the majority who voted for the deposite act
contemplated no such íeturn, and the last proviso
of its thirteenth section rendered the demand for it
impracticable No more than ten thousand dolíais
of the sum deposited with the State hating the
laigcst share of the public money, as from New
York, whose proportion would exceedfivemillions,
can be called for in any one month, without thnty
days' notice, and but a ratable pait of the sum
called for, in any one year, can be lawfully de-
manded of any State So that when New York
should be called upon to pay ten thousand dollars,
Virginia w ould hav e to provide about a moiety oí
that sum, and if a larger amount be required, an
additional notice of thirty days, for every addi-
tional twenty thousand dollars, is to be gn en The
propoitions of the total sum called for fiom the
several States, is tobe in the same ratio with ¡he
original distribution In no one year, therefoie
could more than a very inconsiderable pan of the
deposites be demanded undei tins construction of
the deposite act If such a constitution be incon-
sistent with the title and letter of the act, it is not
with its history, lor, while a large pioportion oí
those who voted for it, wished and des gned to make
it a simple distribution of the public money among
the people to whom it pioperly belonged, we were
distinctly informed that, unless we introduced those
mcongi nous and absurd provisioi s, it would en-
countei the Executive veto
Mi  Chairman, I was one of that majority, and
