JEFFERSON CITY, October 18, 1864--2.40 p. m.

Major General A. J. SMITH,

Sedalia:

The following from General Curtis:

My advance found at Warrensburg to-day that rebels have left Sedalia, going to-ward Lexington, where heavy artillery firing was heard to-day. I am now moving down on Lexington road, where I suppose the enemy may move. My advance guard have reached Lexington this morning, but it may not be strong enough to fight a battle.

He says also:

I am after Price on two lines, one advance near Warrensburg, the other at or near Lexington.

JOHN V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 18, 1864.

Major-General SMITH,

Sedalia:

General Pleasonton received his dispatch. Ascertain the latest news, give it me with your views. Ask Pleasonton to open communication with Warrensburg, to verify Curtis' report, and procure the aid of the Warrensburg people in keeping open communication and watching the enemy's movements. Please telegraph as early as you can, that we may have everything arranged to-night. Let me know if the fords of the Blackwater on Sanborn's front are all good.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

SEDALIA, MO., October 18, 1864.

Colonel J. V. DU BOIS,

Chief of Staff:

I think the disposition the commanding general has made of the troops in good, and that if we should find the enemy moving east and south I will strike them by forced marches on the right flank. General Curtis will check their march west. I expect important information to-night, and will act accordingly. I regret that my other division is not up, but will move without it, leaving a force at Marston's Bridge if I find the enemy moving southeast; also a force at La Mine Bridge. Will order two regiments to that point.

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General.
