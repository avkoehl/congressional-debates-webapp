THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 7#
following resolutions for adoption by the House,
and send them to the desk of the Clerk that
they may be read.
The Clerk read the resolutions, as follows:
Resolved, That in the death of Hon. Texjman H.
Hoag, late Representative in Congress from the
tenth district of Ohio, this House has lost a worthy
and useful member, the country a most estimable
citizen, and his family, relatives, and associates a
steadfast and valued friend.
Resolved, That to give expression to their due
appreciation of the talents, attainments, and patriot-
ism of the deceased, and to indicate their regret and
sorrow for his lamented death, the members of this
House will wear the usual badge of mourning for
thirty days.
Resolved, That a committee of five be appointed,
to accompany the remains to Toledo, Ohio.
Resolved, That these resolutions- be spread upon
the Journal of the House of Representatives, and
that a copy of them be sent by its Clerk to the family
of the deceased.
Resolved, That, as a further mark of respect for
the memory of the deceased, this House do now
adjourn.
Mr. BINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, in pursu-
ance of the instructions of the Ohio delega-
tion in this House, I second the resolutions
which have just been read. In doing so 1
desire to pay a humble tribute to the charac-
ter of my deceased colleague, Mr. Hoag ; not
unmindful, however, of the appropriateness
of the words which have just fallen from the
lips of my colleague, [Mr. Morgan,] and
which, in all their simple force and truthful-
ness, I adopt. The dead need no eulogy.
I have hitherto abstained, during all the
years of my service in this House, from par-
ticipating in these manifestations of personal
regard for deceased members, from the con-
sideration the dead need no eulogy. The dead
by death have become immortal, and they are,
therefore, beyond the reach alike of our cen-
sure or our praise. Nothing that we can say
can add to or take from the Character which
belonged to them living and which belonged
to them dying. The only offices left to the
survivors of departed men toward the dead
are to make honorable mention of their names,
to imitate their virtues, and to perpetuate, by
just and truthful record, their services in pub-
lic and private life, giving decent and Chris-
tian burial to their perished dust.
It was not my good fortune, Mr. Speaker,
to have intimate personal acquaintance with
my departed colleague. His period of service
here was too brief to admit of much personal
intercourse. What I say of his character to-
day comes to me through the good report of
his neighbors, who have known him long and
well, and who by a vote of more than fifteen
thousand elected him to represent the people
of his district in the councils of the nation.
Itgives mepleasure to add further that during
my visit last fall to the city of Toledo, the place
of my deceased colleague's residence, his neigh-
bors invariably spoke of him in terms of the
highest regard, declaring him to be a man of
upright character and pure life, industrious,
kind, generous, patriotic, and faithful to all the
obligations which he owed to his fellow-men
and to his. country.
. I am authorized by those who knew him to
say that in the hoar of the nation's trial he was
more than a Republican, more than a Demo-
crat, in that he was a patriot for his country,
giving generously his support to its defenders
from the*beginning of that hour of trial to its
close.
I am further advised, Mr. Speaker, that
twenty-two years ago our deceased colleague
came a stranger to the city of Toledo, without
means, and that by his industry and attention
to business he acquired an ample competence
for himself and for his family; and, what is
more, that by the uniform good conduct and
uprightness of his life he won the confidence,
respect, and esteem of all who knew him.
, Coming to this House of Representatives
with such qualities of character, we are not at
liberty to doubt that if it had pleased Provi-
dence to prolong his life and his strength he
would have discharged the trust committedto
him with such fidelity as to command the entire
approval of the House and of the whole coun-
try.
But, sir, it has been otherwise ordered by
Him "who doeth all things well." Our col-
league, in the fullness of his manhood, in the
prime of his strength and faculties, has fallen
upon the threshold of his official services, and
fallen so suddenly and so unexpectedly as to
remind us all "what shadows we are, and
what shadows we pursue 1"
Mr. Speaker, the best and most fitting trib-
ute which we can pay to our deceased colleague
is to exemplify in our own lives the incorrupt-
ible integrity of his character.
Mr. WOODWARD. I am unwilling, Mr.
Speaker, to permit this occasion to pass with-
out a word from me to the memory of one who
so lately occupied a place with us on this floor.
He was here bat a short time, but he was here
long enough to win the confidence and esteem
of all who knew him. I shall never forget the
first conversation I had with him on being
introduced to him. He impressed me as a:
grave, intelligent, and honest man. His views
of public life were so sober as to commend
them and himself to my confidence.
Mr. Speaker, it is sad to lose such a man
from our councils. Men of strict integrity, of
sound common sense, of large, catholic, and
all-embracing affections are the great want of
the public life we are living. May God give
us more such, and spare for long usefulness
those we have! Our deceased friend was
such a man, at least he seemed to me upon
our brief acquaintance to be such a man, and
therefore I stand to-day among the mourners.
Those who know him better have spoken fit
words of eulogy; those who knew him best
will not speak of his virtues and his worth,
because the grief they feel is unutterable.
The question being taken on agreeing to the
resolutions, they were adopted unanimously.
The SPEAKER. In pursuance of the res-
olutions just adopted, the Chair appoints as
the committee to accompany the remains of
the deceased to Toledo, Ohio, Messrs. Dick-
inson, Beatty, and Ambler, of Ohio; Mr.
Winchester, of Kentucky; and Mr. Williams,
of Indiana.
And then, in accordance with the resolution
just agreed to, the House (at three o'clock
p. m.) adjourned.
