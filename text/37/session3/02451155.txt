NAVAL GRADES.
Mr. KENNEDY. I move to take up Senate

establish and equalize the grades of line officers
of the United States Navy," approved July 16,
1862.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate re-
sumed the consideration of the bill.
Mr. KENNEDY. This bill has been read at
length, and has been somewhat discussed.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill is in
the Senate, and the question is on ordering n to
be engrossed foi a third leading.
Mr. KENNEDY. 1 desire 10 offer an amend-
ment, to strike out, from the word " aforesaid,"
in line nineteen of section two, down to the word
"grade," in line twenty-five. The words to be
stricken out are as follows:
And in ease of an officer who could not have been pro-
moted aceoiding to iatik and u->age had he been  eeom-
inended for fiuther piomoiion by tin* advisory board afore-
said. the finding of said court, if appioved by the I'lestdent,
shalt remove all disability mcuried by the action of saidad-
visoiy board, and rettoie him to all the rights ofhih grade.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. KENNEDY. There is one more verbal
amendment, in line twenty-five of the second sec-
tion, after the word " promotion," to strike out
" hereafter," and insert "as heretofore."
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That verbal
amendment will be made.
Mr. KENNEDY. I have another amendment
to offer; in line nine, section five, after the word
"promotion," I move to strike out "and the
grade, also, to which each is worthy to be pro-
moted;" so that the clause will then read:
And report to the President of the United States. In writ-
ing, the names ot those officers who, in their opinion, arc
worthy of further promotion.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. KENNEDY. I have one other amend-
ment to this bill. At the end of line fourteen",
section five, after the words "therein interested,"
I move to insert;
And who shall have the right to present any testimony
they may deem necessary to a full and just consideration
of their "cases.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading; it was read the third time, and passed.
MICHIGAN JUDICIAL DISTRICTS.
Mr. POMEROY. I move to take up Senate
bill No. 435, to promote the construction of rail-
roads and telegraphs in the State of Kansas, and
for other purposes.
Mr. HOWARD. I have been making an effort
for several days past to get up House bill No. 257.
It will occupy the time of the Senate but a few
minutes.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question
is on the motion of the Senator from Kansas.
Mr. CLARK. This bill appropriates four mil-
lion acres of land. I had rather that it should be
taken up at some time when the Senate is fuller.
I do not know that I shall oppose it; but I desire
that it should remain until the Senate is fuller.
The chairman of the Committee on Public Lands
is not here.
Mr. LANE, of Kansas. If the Senate will take
it up, we will not press a vote upon it now.
Mr. CLARK. There is no need of taking it
up until the Senate is full. 1 may give my'sup-
port to it; but I submit to the Senators from Kan-
sas if they had not better take it up at some other
time.
Mr. POMEROY. I have no objection to tem-
porarily postponing the bill. I withdraw my
motion.
Mr. HOWARD. I move to take up House bill
No. 267, to divide the State of Michigan into two
judicial districts, and to provide for holding the
district and circuit courts therein.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate re-
sumed the consideration of the bill.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question
is on ordering the amendments which have been
agreed to to be engrossed, and the bill to be read
a- third time.
The amendments were ordered to be engrossed
and the bill to be read a third time. It was read
the third time.
Mr. FOSTER. I apprehend that this bill is
passing withoutattracting the attention of the Sen-
ate. It is a biil reported from the Committee on
the Judiciary, with a report adverse to its pas-
sage. That, certainly, is by no means conclusive
upon the action of the Senate, and it may be that
the committee are quite wrong, and that the bill
ought to pass; but the chairman of the committee
stated the other day, what is familiar to every
Senator who has attended to the question, that it
is an entiie departure from the settled practice of
the Senate for many years to divide a State into
districts, adding judicial districts, of course add-
ing greatly to the judicial expenses of the United
States. The State of Michigan, it is true, is a
great and growing State, has maritime questions
as well as common law questions to be determ-
ined within its limits, and is entitled to all reason-
able accommodations in regard to courts of the
United States; butnotwithstandingall thesefacts,
and the great extent of the State and its rapid in-
crease in wealth and population, in consequence of
its facilities for travel both by land and by water,
by steamboat and by railroad, every part of that
State is now more accessible to every other part
than twenty years ago was onepointone hundred
miles from another. In other words, steam and
modern facilities for communication have brought
all portions of the country into proximity, and
there is, therefore, greatly less need to-day of di-
viding the State than there was twenty years ago,
for all parts of it are, as I have suggested, far
more accessible to all other paits. If this bill be
passed and this precedent be established, we shall
nave, as the honorable chairman of the Commit-
tee on the Judiciary suggested the other day, the
State of Pennsylvaniaâ€”a great and powerful State
â€”already divided into two districts, asking for
a third, and that will be obtained; New York,
another great and powerful State, divided already
into two districts, asking a third, and it will be
obtained; and so on, until every State shall have
additional judicial districts. I know not where the
line^of demarkation between States that ask for
two districts, now having one, and those having1
two, asking for three, will stop. With every
disposition to render all facilities to the State of
Michigan, a State, settled very tnuch from New
England, and with certainly nothing but the
strongestsympathy ,the kindest feeling, as 1 trust,
