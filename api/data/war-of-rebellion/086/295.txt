COMMANDING OFFICER, Memphis:

In a skirmish to-day on Steele's Bayou a wounded officer, finding himself about to die, said that all the forces in this Yazoo Swamp were ordered to move to-morrow; that they were to concentrate at Oxford, Miss., and that a combined attack was then to be made on Memphis. It is possible that there may be truth in the statement and I forward it.
