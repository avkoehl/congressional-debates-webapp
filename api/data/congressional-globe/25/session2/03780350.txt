port of the necessity of the journal of the commit-
tee of this character forming pari of the report, for
as the House had to decide upon the testimony, the
journal was indispensably necessary for them to
judge of the admissibility or rejection of evidence,
the impartiality of calhngand exammmgwitnesses,
&c He commented upon the proceeding as a
party measure, but he hoped party feeling would
pass away, and that the vote upon the question of
privilege would be given, with a simple reference
to the rights and dignity of the House, and of some
of its members With this view, he trusted the
evidence would be reported with the journal, that
the House might judge whether any evidence had
been excluded, which ought to be in possession of
the House He referred to the circumstance that
few of the members, manifestly not a quorum,
were in their seals, and hoped the power of the
House would not be exerted on this occasion.
The business he thought too important to be
ac e j on by a mere quorum, and he was dis-
posed to be good-natured, and lake thing  as they
are, and hoped the House would agree with him.
He therefore moved an adjournment.
The motion to adjourn was withdrawn at the re-
quest of
Mr WILLIAMS, who moved a reconsidera-
tion of the vote by which, on motion of Mr
Thomas, a part of the instructions had been stricken
from the resolution of Mr Adams, which motion
having been enteied,
Mr EOONE rose to a question of order, and
desired it to be ascertained if a quorum was pre-
sent
The SPEAKER, after counting, said that 105
members weie present—not a quorum.
Mr ADAMS moved a call of the House.
Mr ELMORE requested that it might be with-
draw n, to allow him to make an explanation
Mr EELL hoped the House would adjourn. It
was ungenerous to go on in the present state of the
House.
Mr CHAMBERS renewed his motion to ad-
journ, which had precedence of the motion to call
the House
Mr ADAMS demanded the yeas and nays,
w hich were ordered, and the vote was carried in
the negative—ayes 60, noes 68
Mr. ADAMS said, as by the vote there appeared
to be a quorum present, he should withdraw his
motion for a call of the House, and was proceeding
with some remarks u¡>on the motion to reconsider,
when
Mr McKENNAN moved an adjournment, but
withdrew it for a moment to allow
Mr TOUCEY to report the bill from the Senate
"to prevent the giving or receiving a challenge in
the District of Columbia, and for the punishment of
the same," with an amendment, which was, by
unanimous consent, received, referred to a Com-
mittee of the Whole on the slate of the Union, and
ordered to be printed
After some conversation,
Mr McKENNAN renewed his motion to ad-
journ
Mr ADAMS called for the yeas and nay, which
being ordered,
Mr McKENNAN «aid it was not his purpose to
fatigue the House with calling the yeas and najs,
and he would withdraw his motion.
Mr YELL suggested, that as no vote ought to
be take on the subject before the House, it might
be laid on the table for the present, and the House
could proceed with some other business And he
moved to lay the subject on the table, and take up '
the army bill
Some conversation ensued upon this motion,
when,
Mr GRAHAM moved an adjournment
Mr YELL called for the yeas and nays, which
were ordered, ind by a vote of yeas 78, nays 56,
The House adjourned

THE LATE DUEL
The House resumed the unfinished business be-
ing the consideration of the report from the select
committee appointed to investigate the causes
which led to the death of the late Hon Jonathan
Cilley
The question pending was on the motion of Mr
WILLIAMS of Kentucky, to reconsider the vote,
by which the House rejected the latter branch of
Mr Adams's instruction1!, discharging the commit-
tee from the consideration of the question ot breach
of privilege, and fiom the memorials on the sub-
ject of the duel
Mr CONNOR moved a call of the House,
which w as ordered, and proceeded in till 175 mem-
bers responded, when
Mr MORGAN moved that it be dispensed with
Mr WISE hoped the House would persist in
calling his judges, so that there might be a full
bench, for he had no idea of the races taking his
judges off the bench
The motion was rejected, the call further pro-
ceeded in, and excuses rendered for several absen-
tees, when
Mr DAVIS made an ineffectual motion to dis-
pense with the call, and it was further proceeded
in, with closed doors, till ihe roll was nearly called
through, and 180 members were ascertained to be
present, when
Mr MITCHELL moved to dispense with its
further proceedings, which was agreed to—ayes 74,
noes 44
The question then recurring on the motion to re-
consider, and the j eas and nays being ordered,
after some remarks from Messrs TILLING-
HAST, MERCCR, POPE, and McKENNAN,
Mr WILLIAMS withdrew ihe motion at the re-
quest of ihe latter, to enable him [Mr McKennan]
to submit ihree distinct propositions
1   To recommit the report, evidence, and other
papers, with instructions to report nothing more
than the evidence by them taken, and such parts of
the journal as would show what evidence was
offered and excluded
2   That in consideration the House had not
heretofore proceeded against any one in the nume-
rous duels that had taken place, it would not be
just to do so in this instance, but declaring that,
hereafter, challenging a member for language spo-
ken m debate, is a violation of the privileges of the
House
3   Discharging the committee from the further
consideration of the original resolution, and memo-
rials, on duelling, except so far as ordered ly the
first resolution
The question, however, was on the first branch
of Mr Adíms's instructions, requiring the commit-
tee to report only the evidence and journal
Mr ADAMS earnestly advocated the propriety
of his own motion, and ci ndemned, wuh great se-
venty, the course of the committee, and designated
the whole proceeding as an Administration measure
Mr THOMAS, for himself, gave this statement
a most unqualified denial, and disclaimed it m tolo
He called upon the gentleman to give the evidence
of his assertion
Mr ADAMS referred to the journal of the vot s
as evidence of the fact
Mr THOMAS referred to his vote against re-
ceiving the petitions calling for the expulsion of
members by name, and explained his object in the
motions made by him in reference to the teport
[There was much angry feeling exhibited Mr
Adams 'eiterating his charge with great warmth,
and Mr. Thomas repelling it The debate will be
given hereafter ]
Mr. ADAMS explained the object of his motion
to recommit to be, to strip the report of much ex-
citing and excitable debating matter, and relieve
the House from it He insisted that the petitions
did not justify the committee in selecting a few of
the individuals implicated, or that they were of that
character which demanded action, because they did
not come from those most interested m the que -
. tion—the constituents of those members.
Mr McKENNAN, for the purpose of not em-
barrassing the question, or opening a wider field,
withdrew his proposition
Mr WILLIAMS of Kentucky then renewed his
motion to reconsider the vote rejecting the second
branch of Mr Adams's instructions
Mr THOMAS then replied to the charge brought
by Mr. Adams, of making the Administration re-
sponsible for this proceeding
Mr BOON said, when the member from Massa-
chusetts, [Mr Adams,] under a g«neral assault
upon the Administration, uttered what he knew to
be destitute of any foundation whatever, he took
the liberty, as he had an undoubted right to do, of
calling the gentleman to order; and this, said
Mr. B threw that member into a fit of frenzy,
and has drawn from him a train of ill-natured
personal allusions towards myself. The member
from Massachusetts has, in his great zeal to pro-
mote party purposes, declared, wtthout qualifica-
tion, that this is an Administration measure; and
for this, sir, I called the gentleman to order; where-
upon he was most graciously pleased to except
myself from the application of his declaration,
and, by way of retort, said that my votes would
show that I was not influenced by party considera-
tions Sir, continued Mr B. it is a difflcult ques-
tion to settle as to what party the gentleman from
Massachusetts belongs, for it is, I believe, generally
admitted that m politics he is a perfect wmdaenpt.
The CHAIR reminded Mr B that it was not in
order to make any personal allusions to a member
in debate
Mr BOON said he could not reply to the remarks
of that gentleman m order, who was notoriously
known to be out of order whenever he addressed the
House.
Now, Mr Speaker, if my votes are to be con-
sidered as an unerring test of my fealty to the Ad-
ministration, it will be seen that the gentleman
from Massachusetts is sometimes found voting as
I do, and I am free to declare, that whenever such
happens to be the case, I have, on all occasions of
the kind, seriously doubted the correctness of my
vote Sir, on a former occasion, I declared as I
now do, that I was a party man for principle, and
that I would sustain the Administiation in all its
rightful measures, but when any measure shall
be proposed by the Administration, of which I
may disapprove, I «ill exercise my own judg-
ment, independent of the Administration It has
been my fortune to differ on some points with
some ot my political friends, and for which I feel
exceedingly sorry But so it is, and so it must be.
Why, sir, it so happened that the member from
Massachusetts and myself voted in favor of the
appointment of the select committee, to inquire and
report upon the subjects referred to them, but now
that the committee have labored full two months
m the faithful discharge of their duty to their
God, to this House, and to the country, the mem-
ber from Massachusetts is for kicking the report
of the comm tteeout of the House, as an Adminis-
tration measure! Sir, allow me to say that none
otner than one possessing a heatt overflowing with
the most malignant party feelings could be capable
of making the unfounded charge made by the
member from Massachusetts—that this is an Ad-
ministration measure. The gentleman would, if
he could, create the belief that he is quite anxious
to save the time of this House, and to prevent *
d scussion on this subject How far the gentle-
man's professions accord with his acts, in reference
to this matter, may be seen by turning your eyes to
the clock, and observe bow much of the time of the
House that member has consumed from the read-
ing of the journal till the few minutes which were
occupied in a brief reply by the gentleman ¿torn
Maryland, [Mr Thomas,] who has just taken hi 
seat    Sir, if the gentleman be really sincere in bis
