secession, rebellion, and civil war, with all its horrors. Between the Government of the United States and the people of North Carolina there is peace.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPT. OF NORTH CAROLINA,

ARMY OF THE OHIO, Numbers 32. Raleigh, N. C., April 27, 1865.

To remove a doubt which seems to exist in the minds of some of the people of North Carolina, it is hereby declared that by virtue of the proclamation of the President of the United States, dated January 1, 1863, all persons in this State heretofore held as slaves are now free; and that it is the duty of the army to maintain the freedom of such persons. It is recommended to the former owners of the freedmen to employ them as hired servants at reasonable wages, and it is recommended to the freedmen that when allowed to do so they remain with their former masters and labor faithfully so long as they shall be treated kindly and paid reasonable wages, or that they immediately seek employment elsewhere in the kind of work to which they are accustomed. It is not well for them to congregate about towns or military camps. They will not be supported in idleness.

By command of Major-General Schofield:

J. A. CAMPBELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
