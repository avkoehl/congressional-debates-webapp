PATTERSON, MO., April 13, 1865.

Colonel HYNES,

Pilot Knob:

I have reliable information that Farris is on Big Black River with seventy-five men and his object is to plunder. The river cannot be forded. I cannot get at him for a few days. I have sent a small force across Black River at Moss' Ferry to ascertain facts. They were on the 12th instant eighteen miles from this place on the Centerville road.

JAMES SMITH,

Captain, Seventh Kansas Cavalry, Commanding Post.

PATTERSON, MO., April 13, 1865.

Colonel HYNES,

Pilot Knob:

A deserter from Farris' command has just arrived at this post. He says Farris has not got more than twelve men with him, but his object is to raise a company for the purpose of raiding through this part of the State. I will send him south just as soon as I can cross Black River.
