Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have the honor to report that I have scouted the country southward the Rappahannock as far as Orleans and find that Munford has additional bodies of his cavalry scouting in that direction, though not manifesting any determined show of hostility. I have no further changes to report upon my lines from Front Royal to Manassas except the establishment of a post at Linden.

Very respectfully,

John W. GEARY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

(Same to Major-General McDowell.)

Flag-Officer L. M. GOLDSBOROUGH,

Hampton Roads:

Have you any news from the gun-boats up the James River? I have tried to communicate via Jamestown, but have only learned that some gun-boats passed up. We are much impeded by the bad weather and roads. Making some progress, however.

G. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

FORT MONROE, VA., May 15, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Every since you left Fort Monroe I have visited Norfolk every day. This day I visited the city to ascertain in what light I was to consider the citizens - whether as a conquered city, belonging to the so-called Confederate States, or citizens of the United States. I presented the question in order to know how to treat them if they acknowledged themselves citizens of the Union. I had no doubt the port of Norfolk would be opened, and the trade of the city would be re-established between other cities of the United States. If, however, they considered themselves detached, and as belonging to the so-called Confederate, the benefits which would result from the suggestions as presented would be withheld. I am to receive an answer to-morrow.

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General, Commanding.
