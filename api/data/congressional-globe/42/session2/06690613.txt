Answer. The Contest was all in the party,
as there was but one party substantially within
the State at that time, and that is substantially
true now. There was but one party in the
State, and it was a contest within the party,
and based largely upon local grounds. Mr.
Carney lived in Leavenworth, the chief city of
the State, and his claims were largely pressed
on account of that, so far as our people were
concerned. I was'there myself and opposed
his election.

ing sentiment in favor of any one before the

which always occur.

that Senator Pomeroy would be reelected
before the Legislature was elected.
Question,. After the Legislature was elected,
and before it assembled, what was the general
impression in regard to Senator PomerOY's
reelection ?

sides that he would be elected and that Car-
ney would be elected. The lines were very
closely drawn and they had earnest supporters,
confident believers in the election of each of
them.

the assembling of the Legislature—supposed
to be candidates against each other for the
long term?

inent candidates 'o. .re the people of the State.
Question. And continued to be candidates
against each other up to two or three days
before the election?
Answer. Yes, sir; both were struggling for
the long term.
Question. Carney never was a candidate for
the short term ?
Atiswer. No, sir; not until within three or
four days of the election.
Question. Was he then?
Answer. Yes, sir; distinctly so.
Question. Did he get any votes?
Answer. Yes, sir; he got all of them except
those for Ross. They were the only candi-
dates at the last ballot.
Question. Was there any caucus of die
Republican members before going into the
election ?
Answer. Not in the sense in which we use
to hold caucuses.
Question. No nomination by caucus?
Answer. No. sir.

and voted ?
Answer. Yes,-sir; there was no party caucus;
only the friends of the different candidates.
There has never been a party caucus since I
have beeu in the State.
Question. After the Legislature assembled,
was there auy doubt as to the result of the con-
test between Carney and Pomeroy ?
Answer. 0, yes, sir; it was not settled when
the Legislature assembled which of the two
would be elected. As I said, Mr. Carney re-
mained a candidate against Pomeroy up to
within two or three days before the election.
