BUDD'S FERRY, March 13, 1862.

Brigadier-General MARCY:

The bridges at Aquia Creek are still standing and guarded. Two Northern men have arrived at Liverpool Point from Fredericksburg yesterday. They represent large numbers of troops in the vicinity of Fredericksburg. They have been using the batteries at Aquia to-day. We can take possession of the bridges, if you desire, between this and morning, with the aid of the Stepping Stones. My negro spies are not in, but this information is reliable.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Brigadier-General.
