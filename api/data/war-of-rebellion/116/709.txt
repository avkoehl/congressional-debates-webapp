which I notice that Colonel Wood has received possibly those attentions which my father would ask for him. I write therefore to say that if so my letter will add assurances that those attentions have not been unworthily bestowed, otherwise that you will permit it in the case of Colonel Wood for whatever right it may possess.

I am, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,

W. E. DEMILL.

Extract from the special correspondent of the London Morning Herald appearing in the Daily Dispatch, Richmond, Va., August 7, 1861.

Subsequently Colonel Withers accompanied me to his marquee, where I was introduced to a wounded Federal officer, Colonel Wood, of a Brooklyn regiment, to whom the utmost attention and kindness had been exhibited. That very morning, fully three days after the battle, the unfortunate sufferer was discovered in a neighboring thicket, whither he had crawled after being disabled. I am informed that a couple of his men remained worth him, attended to his wounds and brought him water, the only refreshment they could procure. This is a deed of heroism worthy of being recorded; for why should we not recognize the virtues even of an enemy?

I had some desultory conversation with the wounded colonel, who appeared so gentlemanly and amiable that I am not astonished that he should have been a great favorite with his command. "How much better," I observed, "that the unfortunate contest which now wages between both sections of this country had been aerated by mutual concessions-by anything in fact short of bloodshed?" "Indeed, yes, sir," he rejoined in a weak, tremulous voice, 'seeing that the same results must ultimately ensue, then how much more politic to have realized them without war than with it. " Colonel Wood seemed overpowered by the kindness and hospitality shown to him by an enemy, from whose hands he was led to expect no favor and from whose heart no compassion. I am credibly informed that the wounded Federalists in our hospitals frequently weep owing to the uniformly kind manner in which they are treated. It seems I fear a prevalent idea with the enemy that Southern soldiers are destitute of the common feelings and amenities of humanity, and that no quarter need by expected should the fortunes of war place them at their mercy. "Kill me, if you like," observed a wounded man to one of our soldiers who approached him as he was lying helpless on the field; "kill me, if you like. I am a true citizen and Southerner, but was forced into the thing. Kill me, if you lick. "

Resolution adopted by the Confederate Congress August 22, 1861.

Resolved, That the President be requested if in his opinion not incompatible with the public interests to communicate to Congress the letter* from General Bonham, dated the 26th, reporting the hanging of two sentinels of the South Carolina troops who were captured on the 17th of July by the enemy near Centerville, and also any information he may possess relative to the facts asserted therein.
