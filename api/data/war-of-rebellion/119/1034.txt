Point Lookout has recorded his name under one of the four questions. I have nearly a regiment recruited. I can get more when I get more prisoners. I will be prepared to receive prisoners at any point where there is steamboat navigation, upon being notified.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General and Commissioner for Exchange.

Fort Monroe, Va., March 11, 1864.

Honorable ROBERT OULD, Agent for Exchange, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: Will you please send for our officers from distant points, Texas and elsewhere. I hear complaints that none but officers from Richmond can be exchanged, which embarrasses our action.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General and Commissioner for Exchange.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,OFFICE COMMISSIONER FOR EXCHANGE,

Fort Monroe, Va., March 11, 1864.

Honorable ROBERT OULD,

Commissioner for Exchange, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: I see by a Richmond paper, a copy of which I send for your information, that the officers who accompanied General Kilpatrick in his late expedition and were captured by your forces, have been confined in irons.

To such a report I give little credence, and before I take any action in relation to it I desire an authoritative confirmation from yourself.

I call you to witness that since I have had charge of the after of exchange and treatment of prisoners I have endeavored that all things should be conducted, in this regard, upon the most humane principles of civilized warfare. I therefore shall not be considered by you as making a threat when I announce the determination of my Government to return the promptest and severes retaliation for the treatment of those officers, if I learn this report is possibly true.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General and Commissioner for Exchange.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,OFFICE COMMISSIONER FOR EXCHANGE,

Fort Monroe, Va., March 11, 1864.

Honorable ROBERT OULD, Agent for Exchange, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: I have the honor to request that the body of Colonel Ulric Dahlgren, late of the U. S. Army, which we learn is buried in Richmond, be permitted to be forwarded by flag-of-truce boat, to be delivered to his afflicted father, who is waiting here to receive it.
