thus leave Stevens' Gap without a very strong support. In this case the general commanding directs that the brigade of General McCook's corps which he has been ordered to detach for the defense of the gap shall hold that pass at all hazards till General G. Crook and the cavalry at Dougherty's Gap and Valley Head can close up and join the brigade at Stevens' Gap. Should these forces be compelled to fall back, they will retire along the mountain road to Chattanooga, contesting the ground inch by inch, and giving due notice of their retreat.

You will direct General Crook to hold his command well in hand and keep his trains ready for ready [rapid] march to Stevens' Gap. General Crook must watch the movements of the two armies closely, and use his discretion as to the time when he should retire.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
