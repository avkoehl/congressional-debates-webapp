His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

Copy of General Ingalls' dispatch to General Haupt, at Gettysburg, of this morning, received and communicated to General Couch at Shippensburg. Another regiment from Camp Curtin goes forward to-day. Every effort will be made to get the troops in the field. General Smith was yesterday in Waynesborough, Franklin County, near the Maryland line. He and General Couch were in communication, and both, I judge, with General Haupt, at Gettysburg.
