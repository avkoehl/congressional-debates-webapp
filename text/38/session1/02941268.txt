THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOB!.
March 24,
and of the value of all property, it is the firstduty
of-the statesman and lawgiver to understand, and
exactly understand, what is the basis of all this
property, that is, what is the amount and char-
acter of the currency. Of late, and only of late,
we have been enabled to obtain from the Secretary
of the Treasury monthly and semi-monthly state-
ments of his issue of paper and of his currency,
although the law has been from the beginning that
heshould publish such statemements, whichare of
. the highest importance to all men in the country,
but most especially to all business, men. 1 hold
in my hand the official statement of March 15,
by which it appears that there had been issued,
up to that day, in temporary loans, $47,207,545.
Now, let me not be told that these temporary
loans are not currency, because, substantially,
they are currency. I call the attention of the hon-
orable gentleman from Massachusetts to the fact
that in my own city of New York, on Monday
last, when the statement of the clearing-house was
made, there appeared to be $13,000,000 of these
temporary loans acting as currency in the trans-
actions ot the clearing-house, used in the settle-
ments of the banks ns currency, and no doubt
they are used elsewhere as currency just as they
are used in New York.
Tlieie had been issued on the 15th of March
in United States Treasury notes $449,073,616—
#49,073,616 of United States Treasury notes be-
yond what the honorable gentleman from Massa-
chusetts says is the currency of the country,
which he set down as only $40Q,000,000. There
had been issued on that day, of fractional cur-
rency, $19,173,320. Of the new Treasury notes,
■which the Secretary of the Treasury has the au-
thority to issue to the amount of $400,000,000,
there was issued on the 15th of March, in one-
year Treasury notes, #14,600,000; in two-year
Treasury notes, $115,531,441. Of certificates of
indebtedness there had been issued on that day
,$134,098,000. The table, therefore, of currency
issued March 15, 1864, stands thus:
Temporary loan  $47,207,545
United States Treasury notes....  449,073,616
Fractional currcncy  19,173,320
Interest-bearing Treasury notes  130,131,441
$045,585,932
Add certificates of indebtedness  134,09^,000
$779,683,92a
Let me here, before passing from this subject,
call the attention of the House to some kindred
facts. The public debt of the United States was
on the 1st ot" March $1,513,291,042; on the 15th
of March, #1,580,201,744. The increase has been
$83,296,59a in fifteen days! The items of increase
have been us follows:
Two-year legal tenders $20,079,383
One-year legal tenders  8,7-10,000
Fractional currency    427,(500
Five per cent, certificates at ten days  7,018,626
Unpaid arrearages  39,040,410
Total $75,906,125
Of this increase, in round numbers $30,000,000
has been in currency, or $2,000,000 per day, and
if all the claims on the Government had been paid
the increase would have been $40,000,000 more.
Sir, these are facts that need no comment. They
point of themselves irresistibly to the great paper
gulf into which we are drifting. TheGovernment
(March 15) had a paper currency of $645,585,922,
without the certificates of indebtedness, often act-
ingas currcncy, but with them $779,683,922in all.
Sir, no Government on earth.no people can long
swim and not sink in such fathomless depths of
paper money acting as currency. The rise in
gold, as well as the rise in beef, pork, &c., the
strikes of laborers for higher wages, are all terrible
admonitions to the Administration of theGovern-
rnent of the bottomless pits they are digging to bury
up the industry and the property of the country.
Now, the honorable gentleman from Massa-
chusetts and those engaged with him in this bill
propose--whatr To stop, to pause ? Oh! no, but
to go on with this expansion of the currency, and
to add tinder this bill $300,000,000 more, making
in all $1,000,000,000 in cuitency! Sir, 1 was
about to make a remark upon a currency, thus
running beyond the hundreds of millions into the
billion, but 1 forbear, as figures and facts them-
selves, even if silent, are the most eloquent and
significant commentators.
The honorable gentleman from Massachusetts
will go with me further, because he is on record
as going with me further, in his publications, that
there are many other species of currency besides
those I have described in the tables I have been
giving. And I have not only the authority of
the honorable gentleman, but I have also the au-
thority of Hon. Albert Gallatin, the second great
financier of our country, given in a work which
he published in 1830 in order to defend before the
country the then United States Bank. In that
book he speaks of many kinds of currency, and
among them of bank notes and bank deposits.
The honorable gentleman from Massachusetts in
his own work, to which T have alluded and which
I now hold in my hand, admits that bank depos-
its are to be considered as currency,so that he is
on record with Albert Gallatin in support of this
proposition, that not only bank notes but bank
deposits, as well as bank drafts, bank accept-
ances, and bills of exchange, are all included in
the currency of a country. So that upon the act-
ual basis, as it now exists, of the currency of the
country, an extension is already goingbeyond the
powers of arithmetical calculation to describe it;
which can only be well understood in the formu-
las of algebra. «
Now, sir, the effect of such an enormous ex-
pansion of the currency is seen, shown, and felt
on all sides of us. I call the attention of hon-
orable gentlemen to the statements of the clearing-
house m New York; and there'is 110 fact which
shows more significantly this gigantic increase in
the exchanges and the currency than these reports
of the clearing-house in New York. The reports
for ten years prior to the close of 1861 show that
the average daily clearances in the clearing-house
in New York were only $22,000,000 a day, while
for a considerable period of time recently, the clear-
ances of the banks in the city of New York have
reached an average of $115,000,000 a day, and on
Monday last, as shown by the bank tables pub-
lished in the papers, the clearances in the city that
day ran up to theenormoussum of $146,000,000;
so that since the commencement of the issue of
this paper currency authorized by Congress the
increase of daily clearances has run from twenty-
two millions up to one hundred and forty-six mil-
lions on Monday last. The conscquencc is that
in the revelry and intoxication of speculators and
speculations, the country exhibits a spectacle
never before exhibited on earth since the days of
John Law. Wall street now, in its numerous
boards of brokers, in its gold board, its mining
boards, etc., is just as wild us was the famous Rue
Quincampoix. No pen nor pencil can picture, even,
'the scenes there daily exhibited; and as if day
were notlongenougli for men to clinch themselves,
when the increase came by thousands, perhaps,
the hour, the fury is prolonged till late in the night
at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, in the upper part of
the city. Such an exhibition, 1 say, of daily and
now of nightly speculation the world, 1 think, never
saw before, not in the South Sea bubble, certainly,
nor even in the Mississippi bubble of the famous
John Law. The rage of 183G in our own coun-
try, nor of any other period in our history, has
equaled it. The Continental money speculations
of 1780-81, when paper was as five hundred to
one of gold, and when $200,000,000 of old Con-
tinental notes were in the agonies and throes of
their expiration, were nothing like what we now
see. We exhibit the amazing spectacle, orrather
the amazing delusion, of growing richer and richer
the more we consume of life and property by war;
and we reason or seem to reason that war is a
divine institution to make the rich richer and the
poor as rich as the rich. Wegoon importing far
beyond our exports; and the looms of Lyons
cannot weave silks and satins and tapestry costly
enough for us, nor the cashmeies of India now
satisfy our luxurious tastes. The china of Dres-
den nor of Prague nor of Sevres, nor the figured
carpets of Aubusson, appease us; while the world
looks out as upon apeople in a mad-house, who,
in the midst of all the horrors of a civil war, strip
themselves of their precious metals to put the pro-
ceeds upon their backs or in their boudoirs or buf-
fets. The man, or set of men, who expands the cur-
rency of his country up to or beyond $700,000,000
is responsible for all this, and the man, or the set of
men, who would add on our currency $300,000,000
more, is responsible more, for all eyes now are
wide open to the fatal consequence*.

The honorable gentleman from Massachusetts
also is pleased to tell us that his $400,000,000 of
currency was issued without cost to the public;
that is, that this $400,000,000 oflegal tender,which
goes floating in and outof theTreasury, was issued
without cost to the people or to the credit or honor
of the country. Nothing is more illusive; no dec-
laration conld have been more erroneous, no con-
ception could have been m-ore fatal to the public
credit or to the public confidence than an idea like
this, so often repeated here and elsewhere.
Let us look for one moment at the effect upon
the public debt of the country. The debt of
the United States on the 15th March, 1864, was
$1,510,201,774. Now, sir, had this debt been con-
tracted upon a specie basis, estimating gold at a
value of sixty-two and a half per cent, premium,
it would have been, on the 15th March, 1864, only
$943,876,109; which would have been a saving to
the United States of $566,325,665. But gold, in-
stead of being sixty-two and a half per cent, pre-
mium, stood yesterday in the New York-market
at sixty-six and sixty-seven. So then the Gov-
ernment has lost, by the transfer from gold to pa-
per currency, about six hundred millions. If we
do not appreciate that fact now, we'shall when the
debt as well as the interest comes to be paid in
gold. There would, I repeat, have been that saving
if the country had continued under a hard money
currency.
I wish to call the attention of the honorable
gentleman from Massachusetts to the exceeding
loss to the country by the issue of his $400,000,000
of paper currency in the great increase of prices
that it has effected. I hold in my hand a table of
prices in December last, and found in the Decem-
ber report of the Secretary of the Treasury, show-
ing the increase in a number of articles necessary
in this war, which I ask the Clerk to read, be-
cause it will be bettor heard and be better under-
stood if read at the desk than by myself.
The Clerk read, as follows:
Pricei of December, 1860. 1863.
Flour, per barrel $4 75 to
Oats, per bushel  37 to
Corn, per bushel  67 to

Mr. BROOKS. It will beobserved thatthe two ta-
bles of debt and prices nearly correspond. The in-
crease in the premium of gold is about the increase
in the price of these articles. So as the currency
has been inflated the price of these leading articles
has been inflated also, and the Government has be-
come so much the more debtor to the capitalists
who loaned the money to buy these articles at their
inflated prices than it would have been if it had
issued no legal tender as gold, but had done its
business actually in gold.
The honorable gentleman from Massachusetts
was also pleased to say that a war like this couldnot
be carried on without paper money. I am indis-
posed altogether to assent to that proposition. I
have shown from the authority of Mr. Gallatin,
and I could show from the authority of a hundred
as distinguished financiers, that this war could
have been carried on as a hard money war without
the suspension of specie payment. The history
of the world, too, shows that it conld have been
done. I call the attention of the House and the
country to the fact that at thismoment in one third
of the territory of this nation, from the Rocky
mountains to the Pacific, and up and down the
Pacific slope, paper currency has not been per-
mitted to exist. California and the surrounding
region has a hard money currency. That people
discharge all the functions of their business in
gold, which is the only currency. The higher
law of gold thus operates over one third of theter-
ritory of the Republic. Ay, in full one third ex-
ists hard money currency. The people there are
as much at war as we are, and yet the gentleman
