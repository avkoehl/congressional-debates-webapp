small that if the enemy undertakes to hold Hatcher's Run with his cavalry he can easily bar the passage to my small command, which is only about a regiment. I think it very probable Hoke has come over [to] this side, leaving Field and Kershaw north of the James. I am quite satisfied Lee will offer a stubborn resistance to any attempt on the South Side road. I don't think he can detach a force so fa as will at all jeopardize Warren. He may harass and interrupt the work of destroying the railroad, but Warren has roads to the eastward with means of crossing the Nottoway at any point, and can always withdraw. The difficulty of taking advantage of Lee's detaching against Warren is to get positive information of the fact in time. The only certain information will be Warren's report, unless deserters should come in to-night or to-morrow morning. I send you the last report* from signal officer.

CITY POINT, VA., December 8, 1864-10 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

Your dispatch received. I think it will be well to send out a division of infantry to help forcing a crossing of Hatcher's Run and find out what the enemy are doing. Send them in the morning. The enemy are playing a game of bluff with us now, and as we hold the strong hand we want to take advantage of it. Any further movement than that in support of the cavalry crossing Hatcher's Run will depend upon developments.

Lieutenant-General GRANT;

Brigadier-General Ledlie, after an absence of four month on sick leave, has to-day returned to this army. After the reported conduct of this officer at the assault on the enemy's line on the 30th of July last, where it is well understood he failed to accompany his division when it advanced, and for other reasons, I am constrained to request he be relieved from duty with this army.

(Received 11.10 p. m.)

Major-General MEADE:

General Ledlie has been recommended by me for muster out of service. Order him to his home to await orders,and communicate to him the fact that he cannot have here again another command.
