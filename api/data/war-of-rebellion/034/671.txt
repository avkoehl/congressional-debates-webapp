Monday afternoon, I ordered Captain van Doehn and Captain Procter, Eighteenth U. S. Infantry, to throw up some rifle-pits on the cross-roads and Madisonville pike. (See figure A. *) I took a locomotive, and taking Captain D. Kenney, commissary of subsistence, proceeded as far as Forster's Crossing, examined all roads and bridges, placing pickets and sending out scouts, and gave directions where to place reserves along the whole line. I also placed picket at the bridge at Morrow and Fort Ancient, and sent scout out from all these point, that i might be informed of all movements of the enemy. Monday night, Captain Procter, with 150 men, whim I had organized from the convalescents in the hospitals, were dispatched into the rifle-pits, which instructions to hold them, and annoy and delay the enemy should they advance on these roads. During that day and night, militiamen from the adjoining country commenced arriving, but no arms being in camp, they could not be armed.

Tuesday morning, at 2 o'clock, a telegram from General Cox ordered me to send out cavalry patrol to Glendale. Captain George Austin, second Kentucky Volunteers Infantry, and acting assistant adjutant-general, with 15 cavalry, was ordered forthwith upon this duty. At 5 o'clock a citizen of the neighborhood report Morgan only 5 miles from Camp Dennison. I ordered immediately 100 militiamen, with axes, to report to Captain Procter, and with instructions to obstruct the roads by felling trees. I also ordered 500 additional men of convalescents to report to him, and hardly had the roads been obstructed when Morgan's forces made their appearance, and commenced to shell our troops in the rifle-pits, without success, but finding the roads obstructed, was forced to march 10 miles put of his route. About the same time his flankers, 100 strong, crossed at Dungun's Crossing, about 2 miles north of the camp, and destroyed a train of cars. having just at this time received arms and ammunition from Cincinnati, I armed the remainder, of the convalescents and the militia with all possible speed. Captain Kenney, with about 150 convalescents, was ordered to guard the Milford road; Lieutenant Smith, Twenty Ohio Volunteers Battery, with two companies of militiamen, to the railroad bridge, with instructions to hill it at all hazard. The latter arrived just in time, drove the rebel cavalry back, and, as Captain Procter had followed the rear guard of the enemy closely, united Lieutenant Smith's forces,ad prevented the enemy from crossing and doing any further damage to the railroad. Captain Procter also saved the Madisonville pike brigade.

in the skirmish we lost 4 cavalrymen, who were taken prisoners, and 1 infantry convalescent killed. I took one rebel lieutenant and 4 privates prisoners. The number killed could not be ascertained.

To pursue the enemy farther was out of the question, the convalescent not being able to march any farther. The militiamen were armed with the poorest kind of muskets, and had no commissioned officers. Cavalry I had, from 20 to 30, and their horses were too much fatigued.

The rebel column was delayed several hours in passing, it being 2 p. m. before they had entirely passed. They proceeded on the road to Batavia.

I cannot say too much in the praise of the officers and men of this camp, and also the militia. They behaved as true men and brave soldiers. By promptness in obeying all orders and gallant conduct, the first camp in the United States was several the firebrand of the enemy.
