I am glad to inform you that General Grant has reconsidered the order in case of General Boyle, and I am glad to be able to retain you in this section.

General WILLCOX:

Sent the following the Colonel Harney, Morristown:

What portion of Colonel Garrard's force is with you? How many men did he lose? Did he lose his artillery? Put your men in support of your artillery as they approach your place, and hold the heights at all hazards until General Willcox arrives. Muster all the stragglers with their arms. General and yourself ought to hold the place by all means.
