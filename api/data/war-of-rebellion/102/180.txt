Colonel F. M. MALONE,

Pilot Knob, Mo.:

I have sent one of Farris' men to the Knob to-day. You can get some information from him. He was arrested and brought to this place by citizens. No charges against him more than a rebel soldier. I am out of forage and I think it would be a good time to make a raid.

What say you?
