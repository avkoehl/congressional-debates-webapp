RENICK, September 27, 1864.

General C. B. FISK:

Train just up. Have the news of the capture of the train and defeat of Major Johnston. Will move as soon as possible toward Centralia. General Douglass is moving up through the Perche country with 150 of the First Iowa. Have sent dispatch by special messenger to Allen. This will reach you first. I need some ammunition, but it is not absolutely necessary to have it immediately. General Douglass will be reached at Sturgeon more promptly than any other place. The guerilla force is estimated at 600.

DAN. M. DRAPER,

Lieutenant-Colonel Ninth Cavalry.

Major Johnson was killed. Lieutenant Moore says that 100 of their command is either killed or captured. Not many killed in action. Loyal men are coming in and asking for arms, and, general, we should have them now.

Compel any number of rebels at Sturgeon to go down on the train to Centralia and put up the telegraph wires. How many of the fiends were there and from what direction did they approach Centralia? How long had they been at Centralia when the train arrived?
