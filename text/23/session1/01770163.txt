1834.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Mr. W had many. One petmafatirly was more
dangeiousthan many, and if the gentleman did not
take caie, he feared his pet would snortly nile tne
family.
But the distress of his constituents had been
brought into view He s'ated his belief, iheother
day, in the absence of distress in hio neighboihood.
He left home the latter end of Nov mbei, all was
then calm and tranquil at Pittsburg, and yet the
bank commenced its curtailments on the first of
August preceding, and broke up the domestic ex-
changes on 13th August The high prices of prop-
el ty in Pittsbuig were not í ffected, there were no
complaints before. Since then he had received
many le'ters breathing complaints, and tins morn-
ing t jvo others, uttering threats which weie a dis-
grace 11 the writers He had been told by gentle-
men, now within the range of his voice, that there
would be serious distress, ¡n Pittsburg He told
them that it was strange it nevei had been commu-
nicated to him, till his declaiatiorsheieon the sub-
ject went home Tne question rested between his
constituents and himseli, he admitted ihey were in
difficulties, but the difference between tnem was
as to the source of the real cause of the evil He
told them they saw the removal of the deposites,
and they ft*, the pressure, and they ascribed it to
the action of the Gove>nment He told them there
might beothei and secret causes font Now,they
were not aware tha between the month of Novem-
bei last, and the 13'h of January, the bink cur-
tailed its accormu idations half a miluor, they
were not aware of the amount absttacted fiom

respecting the relat on whici the bank btood at
this moment to the State of Pennsylvania. It was
well known that the Messis Alien, bio'teis in
Philadelphia, took the late Sta'e loans to the
amount ot three millions, an opeiation whicn in

As much had been ~.i>d of domestic exchms;e«,
Mr W reterrei to the letter ot \[ Ciowfirl,
dated 3i luly, 1617, snouing that eventneattenr t,

tion designed to facilitate the busmes.sof the com-
Í68
mercial community. And what was the condition
of the bank' Jt was fully demonstrated t.iat it
was entirely solvent Its duties, the , were still
existing, and the performance of those dunes were
consistent with the desire of gam by the bank, be-
cause distress in the community mustdiminish the
profits of the bank. The contingent drafts, amount-
ing to a million and a half, had all been met and
paid Tneamountwhich thebanic held,due to the
Government, had also been paid It was incum-
bent on the institution, then, to exhibit a good will,
a fuendly disposition towards the community, to
giant íelief as far as was in their power. He
would not say to what extent they could go They
ougnt, however, to go as far as they could, and if
the bank should proceed in a way which indicated
a wish to force a rechaiter, theie were those who
would recollect it. As to his opinions of a Bank
of the United States, he thought he ought now to
express them There wee but two courses that
could be pursued to attain a sound currency One
was by means of a National bank, and the othei
by State binks As to a metallic curl ency, he had
tin own that out ot tn<> question, there was no prin-
ciple upon which it could be founded, and theie
was no power in Congress to secuie it. Suppose
we should throw out of cnculation the paoer of
the National bank, it must be fol'owed by issues
fiom the State banks, and this must throw specie
almost enluely out of cnculation Look to the
Coipoiation of this city—they issue small notes,
and tne metallic curi ency in Wasnmgton is diiven
outof circulation—it has almost disappeared And
it must necessarily be so 1 here was no power in

\U   POINDCXrCR. then rose and addressed
the ^eni'te at lengtn ui suppoitof tne resolution
Mr KING, of Gecig a, ¡o-e and said that the
suJden an.val of the debite on these resolutions
emnded him that, shoitly a'tei the leoolulions
were nfrcduced, he hil made an eff,it to s¿y i
few words anon one b -inch ot the question raised
by them, and to which the hononble Senatoi from
Mississippi had nrofe^sed mainly in his first speech
to direct b.s attention He then failed to get the
flooi, and had abandoned all idea of addressing the
Senate i,pon the snoject He said, howevei, as
the su! ject had been íeuved, he would likestdl to
make a few remarks, out in doing so, that he might
not nteiteie with the pnvileges of the gentleman
who had the flooi upon the special oidei of the
day, he would move to lay the resolutions upon
the table until to morrow. However, (said Mr
K jtuimngtoMr Wilkins,) on this point 1 would
consult the wiishea of the honorable gentleman
himself
Mr WILKINS having expressed his willing-
ness that Mr K should proceed, Mr ft. con-
tinued—
I do not sufficiently disagree, Mr President,
with several gentlemen who have addressed the
Senate upon these resolutions, (either directly or
incidentally,) to feel myself called on to pay any
particular attention to their remaiks. He shoutd
(he said) himself vote lor the íesolution, but he
dissenteu fiom some of the reasons given by gen-
tlemen for their support of it, and he deemed it ef
the first importance m the piesent condition of the
countiy that we should not only act advisedly,
but endeavor to give reasons for om acts that
would be respected by the community to which
they were addresed
Mr K said he would mainly duect the few re-
marks he intended to make to the observations of
the honorable Senator from Mississippi on the low
prices of our ai tides of export, and the causes of
their depression This was a sub,ect in which the
South was particularly interested, and for that rea-
son the honorable Senator from Mississippi had
given it particulai notice
i do not profess, Mi President, (sa.d Mr K ,)
to be very intimately acquainted with the nature
of commercial operations. 1 have bestowed but
few thoughts in the course of ray life on this sub-
ject, and am, perhaps, still less familiar with the
usual influence of a deranged and fluctuating
currercy upon the commercial interests of the
country But, su, (said he,) with my unlearned
notions upon these subjects, the views of some
gentlemen have been so exceedingly wild, or, at
least to me so u isatisfactory, tha  I hope I may
not be charged with piesumption, or even with
affording evidence of a degree of confidence in my
own opinions which I do not feel, if I should at-
tempt very briefly to explain why it is that I differ
so widely in my news with other gentlemen who
have preceded me in the discussion.
Tne honorable Senator from Mississippi had
coniended, if he understood him, that the present
low puce ot cotton was to be^attnbuted to the de-
rangement of tl e currency, and the inequality and
depression of exchanges, which produce a want
of fair i elation between the home and foreign
market, all of which was to be attributed to the
remo1 al of the deposites. Here Mr K turned to
Mi P , and said that he had taken no notes, and
btirg suddenly called up in the (¡elate, he might,
possibly, not recollect accurately some of the
positions of the honorable Senator, and he hoped
if he should misstate his arguments, that he (Mr.
P ) would lake the liber y of correcting him Mr,
P bowmsr assent, Mi   K. proceeded
Sir, (said Mi K ,) that the home pr,ce of an
amele of expoit, m which the speculator usually
deals for ca^h, and ships to a foreign market, winch.
being the market of its greatest consumption, con-
fessedly regulates its prife in all ports of the world
wheie it is produced, or, (to take the othei branch
of the pr ipos tion,) Lhnt the relation between the
home (ii ice of an article of export and the pi ce of
ihe same article in such foieign maiket, should be
materially mil enced by the detangement of the
currency, the fluctuations of the currency, the in-
equality in domestic exchanges, or (what seems
most lelied on) th  want of confidence and (he
want c f credit in this countiy—seemed to him io be
doing violence to all just reasoning upon the sub-
ject, and to be marked with a total disregard of the
most obvious laws of trade, and tne plainest prin-
ciples of commeice
Sn, (said Mr K ,) what renders this assumption
the more extraordinary, is the admission on all
hands that the court'-y has nevr bpen so full of
c ipital as it is at this time Yes, said Mi K, all
accounts { have seen recently from the Atlantic
cities concui in proving that there has rarely been
such an accumulation of j-rivnte deposites m the
hanks of the Atlantic cities, and especially in New
York, as there was at the date of the last accounts.
Of money and currency in the country, then, ihera
was nplethonc abundance, and that, too, not alone
belonging to the banking institutions, and subject
