BATTLE CREEK, August 7, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

One of my men crossed to Chattanooga on Sunday. The greater part of the enemy moved toward Knoxville, about 6,000 remaining. Guns in cars-shed, four 9 feet long, twelve 5 feet long; two in rifle pits above ferry. Six regiments of infantry at Shell Mound. Two brass guns and 150 men. Taylor's six field pieces and three regiments of infantry. Forrest's cavalry, 600 strong, crossed the river on Tuesday, said for McMinnville. The troops are badly clothed and some without arms and shoes.

McCOOK,

Major-General.

BATTLE CREEK, August 7, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

My brother did of his wounds yesterday. Can I take his body home? Please answer immediately.

McCOOK,

Major-General.

HUNTSVILLE, August 7, 1862.

General McCOOK, Battle Creek:

I am shocked and distressed at the intelligence of your brother's death. It is painful to be compelled to refuse your request, but I feel that your services at this time are most important, indeed indispensable. You may send in your stead any officer you can spare. I could not refuse you if I did not believe that we are on the eve of very important service.

D. C. BUELL.
HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 7, 1862.

Colonel MILLER, Commanding Nashville:

You will send a guard of 40 men hereafter with each train as far as Columbia. They will return as guards on return train.

J. M. WRIGHT.

NASHVILLE, August 7, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

The force here is inadequate to spare any for other points. The Seventy-ninth Pennsylvania did not come when the Seventy-fourth Ohio left. I am informed that four companies are to go to Clarksville, but cannot hear from Colonel Mason if he is to wait there until these four companies from Nashville relieve him. Colonel Miller says he is ordered to send 40 men with every train south, but does not know if this means both passenger and freight.

W. H. SIDELL,Major, Fifteenth Infantry, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
