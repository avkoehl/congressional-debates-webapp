CIRCULAR.] HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, TWENTIETH CORPS,

Camp Creek, May 14, 1864.

General Palmer's (Fourteenth) corps is about to move to turn the right of the enemy's position. This division will move to correspond with the Fourteenth Corps movement, General Ward's brigade keeping his left connected with Fourteenth Corps, and moving it forward as the Fourth Corps advances. Colonel Cobrun will move in rear and support of General Ward. Skirmish firing without seeing the enemy and being able to do some execution is but a waste of ammunition and brigade commanders must stop it. Pending the movement above, Colonel Wood will hold his command ready to move forward and take advantage of any results of the advance on the left.

By order Major-General Butterfield:

JOHN SPEED,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
