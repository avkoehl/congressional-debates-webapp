Wooten, Eighteenth North Carolina Infantry, met Colonel Lyman and myself; a truce arranged by us to continue for one-half mile on right and left of us during the time we were out with the flag. Mean time the firing continued on other portions of the line. General Lee being absent from headquarters of his army, we were obliged to remain between the lines until nearly 10 o'clock at night before we received a reply. Had a long talk with Major Wooten, who is a good fellow, and other rebel officers. All expressed themselves as extremely desirous that the war should terminate. I think the hard knocks we have given them this campaign has a little sickened them of the "Yanks." While I was out with the flag (about 7 o'clock) i heard a furious cannonade and musketry about a mile to our right, on the Second Corps line, and upon my return to headquarters found that a round shot that struck Captain McCune, assistant provost marshal, Second Corps (who was standing at the door a of General Hancock's tent at the time), and mortally wounded him. The shot and shell raked the headquarters fearfully and scattered all servant, teamsters, &amp;c.

June 6, 1864.-The usual musketry firing in front with some artillery; our sappers pushing close up to the enemy's lines. Last night and this a. m. General Birney's division got into position on Barlow's left, Birney's left resting on Barker's mill-dam. 4.50 p. m., by direction of General Hancock, went out with another flag of truce on Mechanicsville road, where I again met Major Wooten, Eighteenth North Carolina Infantry, and delivered to him a letter from General Grant ot General Lee, for which I took a receipt and then returned to corps headquarters. No firing on the picket-line as I passed through with the flag. We are losing a good many men in our trenches, killed and wounded, and I presume the enemy are suffering also.

June 7, 1864.-Sharp musketry on our front during the night. Enemy threw shell into corps headquarters, but killed no one; 11.50 a. m., was sent out with flag of truce by General Hancock, carrying letter from General Grant to General Lee on the subject of a cessation of hostilities between the armies until we could get our wounded in from between our lines (which are only a few paces apart in some places) and bury our dead. Put out the flag at the old place on Mechanicsville road. A truce arranged to exist from 6 until 8 p. m., during which time we removed our wounded. Some of the poor fellows had lain between the lines exposed to the sun and rain since the day of the assault on the 3rd instant; their sufferings must have been horrible; we also buried all of our dead; the stench from the bodies was sickening in the trenches. The enemy also removed their wounded and buried their dead. No firing of consequence after dark.

June 8, 9, 10, and 11, 1864.-Nothing of unusual importance occurred on Second Corps line during these days. We remained in the same position as held on the 7th. The usual musketry and artillery fire was maintained by both armies, but no assaults were made.

We continued our sapping operations.*

aNOTE.-I stood within almost arm's length of McCune and am quite positive he stood square in the general's tent door. Dougherty and I carried him round behind the chimney of the house.-C. H. M.
