General STURGIS, Lexington, Ky.:

Telegraph both Gilbert and Carter to have their commands in readiness to move early to-morrow morning, with from six to ten days' provisions. Tell Carter that I wish to know if he thinks 10,000 men, with their horses, can supply themselves in East Tennessee. Send this through quickly as possible. Is Hartsuff in Lexington?

R. H. I. GODDARD,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.
HDQRS. SECOND Brigadier, SECOND DIV., TWENTY-FIRST A. C.,Readyville, Tenn., June 18, 1863 - 2 p. m.

Captain J. R. MUHLEMAN,

Asst. Adjt. General, Second Division, Twenty-first Army Corps:

Morgan has eleven regiments in the vicinity of Auburn and Short Mountain. Wharton, with his brigade or command, is somewhere in the vicinity of Dug Hollow. Wheeler is near the main army. I do not know what troops he has with him. The troops that scout about near our lines tell their friends that we are to be fought before Saturday. I pay but little attention to those reports besides using extra caution. The lady who arrived from the rebel country yesterday, and asks to go through, is the wife of Colonel Grigsby, of the rebel army. She has said, since her arrival (not supposing that I would hear it), that the demonstration of force here was to cover the retreat of the rebel army. i give it as it reached me, without comment.

Very respectfully,

W. B. HAZEN,

Brigadier-General.

[Indorsement.]
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Cripple Creek, Tenn., June 18, 1863.

Respectfully forwarded.

I presume better and more complete information than I posses is at headquarters, but I think the rumors quoted by General Hazen do full justice to Margan's force.

J. M. PALMER,

Major-General.
