CUMBERLAND GAP, July 31, 1862.

Major General D. C. BUELL:

A man named Wilson has just arrived from Knoxville. He was at Dalton from June 16 to July 22. He says that during that time he saw 30,000 troops, with fifty-two pieces of light and two pieces of siege artillery, pass up on the railroad to Chattanooga. He says a formidable expedition is organizing to invade Kentucky and gain my rear through Middle Tennessee. Wagon are being collected at Knoxville for that purpose.

GEORGE W. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, July 31, 1862.

General MORGAN, Cumberland Gap:

There are no orders here about converting Johnson's regiment into cavalry. As Governor Johnson has authorized the organization of two other regiments, and that is as many as you can find, it will be best not to mount Colonel Johnson.

HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, July 31, 1862.

Colonel SWORDS, Louisville:

General Morgan telegraphs that you ask him in relation to sending horses to Cumberland Gap. You have not yet filled the order for horses here, and they are very necessary. General Buell desires you to report how many you have on hand, how many you have sent forward, and when and how they started.

JAMES B. FRY.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Corinth, August 1, 1862.* (Received August 2.)

Major-General BUELL, Huntsville:

Granger telegraphs from the front all but Price's division, 20,000, have left for the east, artillery and baggage by Tuscaloosa, toward Rome. Either they will hold you in check, sending everything spare to Richmond, or they will try a strong advance on you, trying to hold your front and turn your flank. Will see Grant, as you request. Why hold that road?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army.

Huntsville, August 1, 1862.
