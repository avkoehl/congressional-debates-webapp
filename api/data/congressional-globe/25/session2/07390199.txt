red to the mind of my eolleaviK , when, speaking of
the agreement as having been made by General
Ja"kson's ad mi nitration It was all jfight and pro-
per, m lusp«um',"on, for Mr Adams's Administra-
tion to enter into such an arrangement, but to con-
tinue it merely, i>y the succeeding Administration,
was all wrong and he calls for the authority.
Pursuing the order of my colleague, we now
come to the rrst xa of th  new Administration, in

Here it will be perceived that Governor Lincoln,
in h*s statemtnt of the agreement, conñ íes it to the
property merely No«, how is this1 No one, 1
presume, will act use that gentleman of a disposition
to relinquish anj rights belonging either to Mas;a-
chusetts or Maine, as connected with this «ubjoct
For on self, I have at«'a\s regarded him and his dis-
ttngoished broth r among out best friends, and
foremost in av ott ng and maintaining cur claims,
and ib repelling Bi tish pretensions The onlv
Hue solution of tne matter is this, that Governor
Lincoln t\as corrt ponding with Mr MeLa1 e,
upor the subject of certain bespui es al'egfed to hate
been committed upon the pi operty ol the dispu ed
temtoij, and hence he confined himself m his re-
fe-ence to the agreement, 10 that part tit only
•which íelaíed to ihe subject mailer 01 iliscnssion
In this, he and Mr Hamilton adopt the sime
course, and neiUif r change ¡be agreement, or yield
anv lights belonging to the States of Mame or
Ma saohusetls
My colleague iMr E\ans] next íefer* us lo the
letter of Mr Van Buren, then Secretary of State,
to Mr. Vaughan, under date of May 11, 1829, for
further proof of a change m the agreement, aud of
a vntual abandonment tif the lights of Maine If
that leu r be susceptible of any sqeh interpretation,
then I have studie 1 the English language to no
purpose.   Mr Van Buren says

Here is a plain, clear, and distinct avowal of the

Here, it is said, by the qualification of " imme-
diate and indispensable necessity," a door is opened
for British asgrpssion. and a latitude given that
Go\etnment which it did not possess before. But
I vo'tH inquire whether it be any thing more than
vsb?t \ r Clav says, m his letter to Mr. Vaughan,
i i i .ruary 20, 1828, viz :
"Nor ca i they [certain acts of the Buti* h Government] be

ed' i ' more especially so, bespuse it would not
be d ne for the purpose of "strengthening the claim
of t !ep(n/v,"and would be of "immediate and in-
dispensable necessity "
Th's view is supported by reference to a report
madt (o the Legislature of Maine, m January 1829,

Here, it is said, we see the Presidetat ^aobly
yielding the possession of the d.spajed terntory to
Great Britain, and desiring Maaie to acquiesce in
it. And, if the facts «ere so, I Woñ|4 unite wilt
my colleague in almost any language of reptoheu*
sion that he might chc-ose to «mploy. Burwbere, I
ask, is the evidence that the President evKrexpcétfr*
ed any such desire^ It is oaly to be f<mn&4% this
letter of Mr. Bankhead But, on referring to. a
communication from Mj. Van Burert ta the (go-
vernor of Mame, of March 18, 1831, it w^ll bft
found that the President is entirely misunderstood,
and his language palpably misquoted. It raffs
thas.
"In making this commanication to t our rxcetlency, I atu is 
structed by die President to express tu* desire, that while ttie
matter is under deliberation «o steps may be taken by ihe
Stale of Mame, with regard to the disputed terntory, which
might be calculated lo inlrirupt or embarrass ihe action
of the Executive branch of this Govei nmeni upon the sub
ject "
Thus, simply by citing the authority upon which
Mr Bankhead predicated his remark, the whole
charge and compla'nt of my colleague falls to the
ground * But it is said that in a letter of Mr. Li-
vingston, while Secretary of State, to Mr. Bank-
head, October 17,1831, there ¡s an entire acqu es-
cence that Great Britain shoald have the exclusive
jurisdiction of the disputed terntory. In this letter,
my colleague says, all is abandoned, yielded, given
up; and that now we have not a right to set a foot
there. Sir, I have read that letter in vain to find
any such acquiescence in the British claim, or
abandonment of our own. On the contrary, it re-
cognises the subsisting agreement between the two
Governments, and insists on a strict compliance
with it. The object of the communication was to
procure the release from imprisonment of certain
persons v ho had been arrested and imprisoned by
the Provincial Government It seems that m 1830,
just before the award of the rojal umpire, King
William, the Legislatuie of Ma ne incorporated
the ton n of Madawaska. But, as appears ¡a the
communications of the Governor upon the subject,
it was merely in anticipation of the award, and
without any intention of having any formal orga-
nization under the act of incorporation, un'il after
the award should be duly promulgated, never for a
moment doubting that it must be m favor of
Maine. Certain individuals, however, without ta-
structions or authority from the Government, ap-
plied to a justice of the peace m Bangor, to issue a.
•wairant for calling a meeting ol t',e inhabitants,
ftr the purpose of organization,"and choice of
officers The warrant was issued; and while in tne
prosecution of the r design, they were artested and
imprisoned by the Provincial Government, on the
ground that their acts constituted a violation of the
agreement, about which so much has already been
said
Mr Livingston sojght to procure their release
in the first place, on the ground th it their acts,
being unauthorized, and not followed oat, were no
violation of the agreement, and secondU, that even
if it were so, the Prot nicial Government could not
rightfully proceed to try and eon> ict then. It might
be a cause of complaint ajamst our Government, if
their acts were authorized; but to proceed to try,
convict, and panish them, would be a practical de-
cision of the question of exclusive jurisdiction; and
against this he remonstrated m earnest language.
Now, in all this, what is there to condemn' I am
unable to perceive any thing
But my colleague has instituted a compa'ison
between the course of Mr Livingston a  ' e fore-
going case, and the course ot Mr Clay in the case
of the arrest and imprisonment of John Baker m
1828 It is said that Mr Clay used stronger lan-
guage m requiring the release of the prisoner than
Mr Livingston used That is rather a small mat-
ter even il it be so, but it appears to rne, that Mr-
Livingston, ¡n the posit.ons he assumed, took thi
high ? ground of the two They both refused to
justify the acts ot our citizens, who had been
arrtsted, but denied tne right of the Provine al
Government to proceed to trial ami conviction, be-
cause it would be a practical deusioa of the ques-
tion ot right to exclusive jurisdiction Whifelock
