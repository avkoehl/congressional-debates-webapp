CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
not a sufficiency ot the precious, metals in the
world for the purposes of commerc , to allow us
our distributive shaie He instanced the city of
New York, «.here the business m one year a'one
was one thousand five hundred millions of dollars
A friend had assured him of the operation of one
of the banks being two millions of dollars in one
dajfc. It v as impossible to do without the credit
system, for the purposes of the commerce of the
country, and the common operations of the Go-
vernment He maintained thatlhe specie circula-
tion was liable to variation as well a? a mixed cur-
rency The sensation would be 'he same m pro-
portion, both were governed by the commerce of
the country, and the quantity or scarcity of it in the
market.
Mr. C said he had heaid it intimated that
there would be no use m passing a bi'I to íechaiter
a United States Bank, as the President would cer-
tainly veto tbs measute He did not believe iheie
had been any such expressitn of determination on
the part oí the Eveculive If iheie had been, it
was prejudging the matter He asked what
would be said, if the Senile were to say
that it nould be of no use foi the Executive
to make certain appointments, as they would
not be confirmed They might take his vord
for it, that if the will of the people weie clearly
manifested in relation to this subject, the President
would never veto the bill He was too ¡rood a
democrat to divorce himself fiom the people,
■whatever othei divoicts he might contemplate
He argued that if this bill should oe passed, the
most disastrous consequences w ould ensue that the
deposite banks hid not fulfilled the expectations of
those who had advocated the lemov ü of the depo-
sites, and denied that the domestic exchanges of
the country coull be as well regulated by the
State institutions is by the Bank of the United
States, and that the " experiment" was a total fai1-
uie He next adverted to the question of currencj,
and contended that one of gold and silver only was
not practicable, if deniable, that it was not just, if
both desirable and practicable, that it w as not with-
in the scope of the powers of the Govei nment He
Jdid, that if even none of these objections existed,
that it would be contrary to the habits of this peo-
ple, unjust—eminently unjust, dangerously un-
just, in the telaüon which exists between man and
man. Having made some observations in ic?ard
to ihe importance of the duties which he and other
Seiiatois had been con cned heie to discharge, ne
continued

Mr C proceeded to condemn the Sub Treasury
scheme on the giound of its being, in his opi non
an "experiment" which ought rot to be tried, as it
was pregnant with evil to th  country He a seit-
eil fet it was useless foi him, or those with whom
he acted on that ñoor, to bring forward any mea-
suie calculated to afford relief to the country, and
which they had reason lo be'ieve would not be ac-
ceptab t to those w ho controlled the deliberations
ofthatbodj He said that he felt himself com-
pelled to declare that, after the utmost considera-
tion he had been able to give lo the state of the
currency and the business of the country he could
conceive of no remedy for the existing disorders
and evils under which we were laboring but m the
establishment of a Bank of the United States No,
he could conceive of none, without the agency—
the instrumentality of such an institution—a Bank
of the United States, undei such restrictions as
should have beea suggested by experience, and
especially under that lestnctioa which he thought
•n oald be the most saiutary of all, to guard against
evils connected with a papei medium, and that was,
a limitation on the powers of the bank which vv ould
cut off all motive for making excessive issues Fe
regarded the establishment of a Bank of the United
States as a settled question Hisopimon was ll at,
for a gieat man} ycais before and indeed up to
the period when the late bank was oveithrown, a
majoritj of ihe people were in favoi of the exist-
ence of sucn an institution He believed that it
was essential and neccssai} to the best mteres's of
the Union.
Mr C ad^eited to sevenl points in the Pies -
dent's Message, and among otheis, to tint in rcfe-
ltnce to the question of "bank or no bank," having
been decided upon by the people He denied this
position, and insisted that the question had never
been tried It was his solemn conviction, he re-
marked, that at no period, since 1816 to the present
time, if ihe question were fairly presented to the
people—sinp'e, naked, and alone—Iheie woull
hive been a large majority m fav or of a bank If
the question were tried in that quaiter of the
country from which he came, the people would be
decidedly for having an institution of that cha-

rior Stales were sn situated that the} could not do

Pne question of a sound currency and the Union,
in his opinion, weie identical And if a bank, in
some foim or other, should not be established,
means, sooner or later, would be íesorted to, to sup-
ply a subsmute ioi it He replied to the argument
that to establish a national bank would be to ag-
gravate the existing distress of Ihe countiy, and
that theie is not specie capital to put it m motion
He < ontendtd that the President vvps misiak u,
and tint the establishment of such an institution
woi Id 1 av e, at tins junctuic, a twofold effect first,
of relieving us of om foreign elebt, and, second, of
regulating the pus<mt delinked state of the eui-
renc} His film belief was, that if a bank ucie
to be established, putl ng into its vaults the public
dene si'ps, and mil nig its notes receivable in pa}-
ment of the public i lies, it v ould, in a short time,
not onlv put the bank in opeiation, but would gra-
dually dng after it all the other banks which aie

had authorized a loan to be contracted, of fifteen oi
twenty millions, ledeemable in c ht oi ten yeais,
the greater part of it would have found its way to
England, liquidated our commercial debts, and
would have prevented the exposition of specie, and

Mr WHITTLESEY oi Ohio said, that Lefoie
proceeding to business this morning, he wished to
make an inquiry of the Cnair in rela'ion to provid-
ing seats for peisous w ho had the privilt°e ol com-
ing on ihe floor of the House He wished to know
whether the Speaker considered that he had the
power to piov de sea's foi those persons In fo mer
times, seats were piovided for persons wno weri
admitlc 1 on the fiooi of the Hous=, and he tnought
itwculdnow be treating those poisons witn no
more than pioptt íespect to provide seats foi them
in fiont of the Ciena's table, or in the oüW vacant
plates on the fiooi of the Hall
The SPEAKER replied that the rules gave the
gen-ral duection ol the Hall to the Cnau, but he
did not know that it gave him the power to provide
s°ats for privileged persens on the floor He would,
howevei, be guided in the maltei by the House,
And if it vv as the pleasure of the Hous , the Chair
vv ould duect seats tobe provided forSenatns and
othei privileged peisons He would take the oca-
sión t) lem-rfe, however, that it hid nev ei been
done hefe ofoie by order of t le Chau
