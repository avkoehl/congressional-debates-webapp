Board of Navy Commissioners—Mr. Parmentér.
Ho. of toipi?.
heieafter, the per diem compensation to mvest-
iJ-uing committees who may choose to travel out
ot this District is to be at least $19 33 But
theie is a little question yetundecided Will the
people sanction it> The hard hand toils labori-
ously for a ¡¡.canty pittance, and, by the sweat of
the brow, earns his daily bread To him you
mete out a twentieth part of this sum, as the
abundant icward of laboi, for ourselves, how-
cvei, there is no fflm too large not to be assumed
with avaricious grip a* falling short of self esti-
mated services Sir, this doctrine, this piactice,
will not satisfy the yeomaniy of the countiy,
neither will they countenance such unwonted ex-
tiavagance, but hold those who authorized it
lesponsible for so palpable a violation of eveiy
principle of economy and even-handed justice
Mr Chan man. I have been charged with de
signing to speak to my constituents Sn, I have
lepelled the insinuated motive as being, in my
case, ontnely inopeiative Yet I would fam de-
sire that eveiy man in my distuct could read
these lemaiks, nay, more, sir, I would desne
that your constituents, the constituents of each
and eveiy membei of this body, may have an
opportunity, not of leading my speech, but of
knowing the self estinfated value of oui own ser-
vicer
In conclusion, Mr Chairman, it seems that I
have occupied the time, if not attention of the
committee longer thin I evei supposed it at all
probable, and I wish you and your constituents to
know that whilst we aie pleaching economy, re-
foim, and letienchment by the hour, we hesitate
not to piy ourselves, at least such of us as are
investigators of abuses, the moderate pei diem of
$11 33, in addition to the usual and statue pel
diem of eight dolhis, and a mileage oí the same
amount foi eveiy twenty miles
Let ub have moic example and less of piecept
Away with  this system   of pound precept and
penny example '    And eie we again undertake to
remove the mote, let us bo cautious  we aie not
ourselves stumbling over a beam
Mr Chairman, 1 thank you and the committee
for the indulgence that has been granted to me,
and trust that I have fully defined my own posi-
tion, as also that of the Committee of Accounts,
and last, though not least, the pontion of the gi and
investigation committee into the defalcations of
Swartwout and others Sir, I withdiawthe mo-
tion to strike out the enacting clause of the bill.
BOARD Or NWY COMMISSIONERS
SPEECH OF HON. W. PARMENTER,
OF MASSACHUSETTS,
In the House of REPticsDNTATivrs,
Febiuary 15, 1839,
On the motion to strike out from the general appropriation
bill all appropnations-for the Board of Navy Gomuussion-
eis
Mi PARMENTER observed that, after so
much discussion of the question now befoie the
committee, and aftei the clear views presented by
the chairman ot the Committee on Naval Affans,
[Mi Ixgham,] he should have felt reluctant to
tiespass upon the time of the committee, and
would not, were it not for the fact that, m the
section of countiy where he resided, and paiticu-
laily in the State of Massachusetts, the people
felt a deep interest m the Navy He thought it
incumbent on him, repiesenting a district where
the operations of the Navv Depattment werecai-
ried on as extensively as at any place in the United
States, to state his views on the proposition now
befoie the committee
Fiom Massachusetts the Navy has had more
seamen than fiom any othei State in the Union
Ilet extensive navigation engaged m foicign and
domestic tiade, and the important and valuable
brmch of hei industty—the fisheries—have en-
aoled hei to contnbute to the stiength and efficacy
of the Navy in a much moie than ordinary pio-
poition,diid, theiefore, m the same latioin which
she Ins supplied seamen, and as her mteiests aie
concerned i i the successor oui Navy, it is natural
that hei sympithies and feelings should be en-
hs'ed Neaily,oi quite half of all the navigation
of the countiy belongs to New England at this
time, and this arm of the national defense has, as
it ought to be, always been watched and favored
m a peculiar degree
I cannot anticipate that the Board of Navy
Commissioneis is to be abolished m this indirect
mode, because the question is too important to a
great branch of the public establishment to be de-
cided without a very full examination of all the
various consideiations connected with it, and that
have a bearing upon it But as the introduction
of the amendment proposed bythegen'leman fiom
New York has led to a veiy fiee and full debate,
theie is some fear that the opposition to the Navy
Board may go beyond what is intended, and ex-
cite some doubts with regaid to the utility and
management ot the whole naval system, and thus
bring into discredit, to some extent, the Navy
itself—a result which all, 1 can have no doubt,
wish to avoid, who know its impoitance for the
national good and protection of the commerce- of
the countiy, and feel pride in the honor it has
added to the fame of the countiy by its achieve-
ments and victories
Ins assumed that theNavyof the United States
has retrogiaded in its essential qualities undei the
piesent Navy Board, that our ships are badly
concluded, that the discipline has become un-
wise, that the expenditutes have been injudicious,
and that theie is a want of íesponsibility in the
Navy Department, in consequence of the present
organization
In the distuct I icpresent, there is one of the
most extensive and best íegulated navy-yards in
the Union—that at Chailestown, and, although
I have h id fiequcnt inteicouise with officers and
others having a knowledge of the subject, I have
ne\ei heaid complaint of want of skill on the
part of the Navy Boaid in mattcis propeily ap
pei taming to then profession The icgulations
of the yaid aie good, which was not the case
befoie the boaid was established.and the system
of opeiations in the building and repairing of
vessels has not been a subject of complaint It
appears to me that, in mattcis of opinion, there
is no good ground for objecting to the board
Naval architects differ on the subject One con-
structor will prefer one model, anothei a different
one, and, as to the form of vessels, some prefer
strength, and think that qua'ity the most impor-
tant, some fast sailing, and some capacity for
comfort and convenience of crews, and so on
But, surely, those who have sailed in our ships
of war, in all climates and at all seasons, who
have fought our battles, who have lived on the
ocean fiom then boyhood to advanced life, ought !
to be competent to decide what foim of construc-
tion will un te in the best w ly all the vai ious re
quisites of an efficient ship of war The charactci
of seamen, their wints, habits, and necessities,
none cm know without expenence and, in the
adoption of such plius as will best piomote the
diffucnt objects in view, experienced naval offi
cers must undoubtedly be the best qualified
Gentlemen point out particulai instances of
poor vessels, but, after all, it is often but a dif-
ference of judgment We all have our paitiali-
ties and piefeienees on this subject A northern
built ship is apt to be considered the best model
at the North, a southern at the South One ar
chitect prefeis one mold, another a diffeient one,
and so through the whole catalogue, but it has
not been shown that any ships are uscle&s, thatany
have not been, or are not now, valuable acquisi-
tions to the Navy, excepting, perhaps, the steam
vessel Fulton. I do not know much about her
I was on board her once, when she was at the
i navy-yard here If she be a failure, there is an
I apology from the fact that she was the first ex-
periment
But, Mr Chairman, I do believe there is a rad-
ical defect in the organization, and that it arises
from the impropriety of the various duties as-
signed by law to this hoard The law gives too
much duty and too much power to the Navy
Commissioners Their power is almost unhm
ited, and extends to the whole concerns of the
Nivy
Mr REED remarked that cveiythmg was
subject to the superintendence of the Secretaiy
of the Navv and Piesident, and that the fourth
section of the law reseived the power of the Sec-
retary.
Mr PARMENTER I am aware of those
provisions, but piactically they have, like all
other íeservations of the kind, been ineffectual
and inoperative The law is very full in point-
ing out the powers and duties rjf the boaid, and
has, to be suie, this general loseivation, but the
law seems to contemplate that the Navy Commis-
sioners should perform the duty The old law
establishing the Navy Department is very brief.
The fourth section of the law, besides, may be
fanly constiuedto relate only to the employment
of vessels
The Navy Commissioners were originally in-
tended to be a board of conned, to advise with
the Secretary of the Navy on the naval concerns
of the countiy, with ceitam powers having ref-
erence to the lules of discipline in the Navy,
fixing the models of ships to be built, planning
their internal apartments, having a general super-
intendence of docks and navy-yaids, attending to
the equipment and armament of vessels, and sim-
ilar duties, directing the distribution of stores and
mateiials in such mannei as the service required
And I do not see but that the public interest would
be bettei advanced by modifying the law, and
placing the Board of Navy Commissioners upon
the ougmal ground intended'—the performance of
such duties as were peculiarly within the compe-
tency-of naval officeis A refeience to the various
repoi ts which have been made On this subject will
show the views enteitained I would refer to the
papéis printed m the volume of State Papers on
Naval affms
But the law of 1815establislnng this board has
given a powei of a vety diffeient description
Let us look at it for a moment I throw out, to
a gieat extent, the reservation of geneial superin-
tendence for the Secretary of the Navy ovei the
doings of the boaid, because it has not and could
not well be exeicised The commissioneis have,
by their rules, placed all the means of information
v, ithin then own powei on naval matters
This law, although brief, is vei y comprehensive.
The fust section provides
" 1 hit tin President of the United States be, and he
herebv is authored, by and with the advici and consent
ot tile Senate, to apjiomt three officers ol thP Navy, whose
lank shall not he below a postcaptnn, who shall constitute
t Boaid of Commissioners lor the Navy of the United States,
and shall have power to adopt such rules and regulations
for the government of tlleir meetings as they rnav judge ex-
pedí* nt, md die boaid so constituted shall be attached lo
the office of ihe Secretaiy of the Navy, and, under Ins su
perinti nch net shall discharge all the ministerial duties of
the s ud ofhee relative to the procurement of naval stores
and m ltemls, md the eon&truction, armament equipment,
and < inplojmmt of vessels of war, as well as all other mat-
ters eonni eted with Ihe naval establishment of the United
Sluts and ihe said boaid shall appoint their own seere
tary who shall receive in compensation for his services a
sum not c\< eeding &2 0Ü0 per annum, who shall keep a fair
record ol their pnceediugs, subieet at ill tunes to the in
speelion of the Picsidoiil of the United Slates and the Sec
retary ol the N lvv  '
I have read the whole of this section, because
there is scaiccly a line which is not impoitant in
connection with tins subject     It provides for a
pei manent board, the tenure of office not limited,
although that question was agitated some years
aftei wauls, but for reasons then stated, was not
alteied     The board is to consist of post captains
in the Navy     They aie to discharge the minis-
terial duties of the office of the Secretaiy of the
Navy " lelativc to the procurement of navnl stores
and mateuals "   Under this piovision, I undei-
stand, the commissioners make all contiacts and
bargains for the supplies of the Navy    Nothing,
it appears to me, can be more unsuitable to tin ir
station     Post captains in the Navy, whose dis-
positions, characters, and habits are so diametu-
' eally opposed to a duty of that kind, whose trade
I it is to fight when their country calls, who are of
a class of menpiodigal and caieless to a pioverb,
I appointed to cheapen with the merchant and me-
chanic the supplies and labor required foi the ser-
vice of the Navy     It is uncongenial with their
' vocation   It would appear deiogatoiy to all whose
| bosoms have thrilled with pude and exultation at
I the glorious deeds of these heroes of the deep, to
| witness them bargaining for a bolt of canvas, a
I bariel of beef, or nny othei  supj^hes      It is, m
my judgment, all wrong for that duty to lie pe"
foimed by them, and  it surely i evei could ha e
been contemplated, but such is the practice und i
1 this law    If this were remedied it would take off
I many of the objectionable points ¡n this case
