HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS, Devall's Bluff, September 22, 1864.

Captain C. H. DYER,Assistant Adjutant-General, Little Rock:

I lern nothing new in regard to the enemy. Shelby used vigorous measures to get all the guerrillas to join him. Some, however, still lurk in the country above.

Very respectfully,

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE FRONTIER, Fort Smith, Ark., September 22, 1864.

Major-General HALLECK,Chief of Staff, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: As I am cut off from communication with Major-General Steele at Little Rock, I address this communication direct to you. I have just learned that a train of 200 wagons sent from this palace to Fort Scot for subsistence was captured on the 19th instant while on its way back at Cabin Creek, fifty miles north of Fort Gibson. I had sent up from here three regiments of infantry and one section of artillery to re-enforce the escort for the train, but they failed to reach it in time. The enemy in my front numbers 8,000 or 10,000 from 5,000 to 6,000 well mounted, while I have not 200 effective mounted men, consequently it is very difficult to keep open my line of communication. I cannot send a sufficient force to render supply trains safe without endangering the safety of this place and Fort Gibson. I have subsistence enough for the present, but unless prompt means are taken to forward supplies I may be greatly embarrassed before they arrive. I would respectfully suggest that a sufficient force be concentrated at Fort Scott to escort the trains through. I can send a force up to Cabin Creek to meet trains if not threatened here at the time by the enemy in force. I anticipate, however, an attack both up this place and Gibson soon. Scarcely any forage is raised in this country this season. We have an abundance of ammunition. This place is well fortified and I shall hold it at all hazards. I have reason to believe that nearly all the rebel force in Texas will be concentrated on this place and Fort Gibson. If so, I will need more troops to defend this line.

Very respectfully,

JNO. M. THAYER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE FRONTIER, Fort Smith, Ark., September 22, 1864.

Colonel J. M. WILLIAMS,Commanding Second Brigade:

COLONEL: I have directed Colonel Adams, with the Twelfth Kansas Infantry, to move at once to this place. You are directed to remain with the First, Eleventh, and Fifty-fourth Colored Regiments and the section of First Arkansas Battery, at Fort Gibson, under the orders of Colonel Wattles.

Respectfully,

JOHN M. THAYER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
