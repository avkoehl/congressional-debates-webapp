Bvt. Brigadier General GEORGE S. DODGE,

Chief Quartermaster:

GENERAL: I have decided not to transfer General Cox's troops to-night, and may not do it at all. Hence I send you the Christopher, to assist in unloading the troops which have just arrived. As soon as you have them unloaded bring them directly to this place and land them on the east bank. I would like to get them all to this place to-morrow, if possible. Land the horses at the Point and let them march up.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S. -Send some ambulance horses to General Terry as soon as you get them.
