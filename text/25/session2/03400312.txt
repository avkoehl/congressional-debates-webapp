Be tí enacted by the Senate and Hoitie of Repx esen-

assenibhd, That the President ot  the United States
be, and he heieb\ is, authorized to cause the unfi-
nished walls of the Treasury building, now in the
rrocets of construction, to be taken down, and the y
matciials to  be removed and applied to the con- I
structwn ot  a fire-proof building of such dimcn-   '
sions ind upon such plan of arrangement as may   I
be required for the use and accommodation of the   >

fer  ic to the lepoit of the committee lately pub- ¡i
hs-lW     Mi  L a Idresscd the committee at length   .
on the whole subject
Mr CAMBRELEN-G thought the House should   |
do nothing more at present than arre t the piesent
building, and not inaks anew oi additional appro-
priation, m the present condition of the Treasury,
of   $150,000,   besides   §140,000  of   unexpended   I
balance     He expressed a hope that, instead of go-   i
mg into the merits and controversies of different
architects,  the committee would rise, so that the
House might progress with more important and (
pressing business
Mr THOMPSON was opposed to the rising of
the committee, for he was anxious that this build- ,
ing should goon, so necessary and indispensable for
the pieservation of the public documents, records,
and aichives, of the Tieasury Depaiiment Mr |
T expressed his confidence in the architectural
skill of Mr Mills
Mr PICKENS regarded the whole question as
oDe of critical taste or judgment, in which, perhaps,
no two architects could be found to agree Every
architect had his own peculiar notions of taste, and,
if this building were pulled down, and another
site and plan selected, that might, m its turn,
be condemned by some other fastidious cri-
tic. It the precedent involved in this bill should
be adopted, there would be no end to if, and
they might be continually pulling down, and
even destroy, all the old buildings'. IJo mat-
ter who might be the architect of a structure,
he would bring a dozen to condemn it. He
preferred the present plan going on, and referring
to the buildings constiucted by Mi Mills in South
Carolina, stated that he had great confidence m
that gentleman
la order to test the sense of the House in regard
to the propnety of this measure, and to the princi-
ples embraced in the es ablishment of such a pre-
cedent, he moved to sttike out the enacting clause
of the bill
Mr. BOON wasm favoi of continuing the build-
ing under the present aiehitect, for he supposed the
controversy originated mainly from another want-
ing the job He had no expectation that this bill
would pass, but if the motion to strike out the
enacting clause should fail, he would move an
im-ndment, the pnrporl of which was, that the
building authorized by this act should be erected in
the city of Cincinnati or Louisville, preparatory to
the removal of the seat of Government west of ths
mountains This bill piesented a fair opportunity
for such a provision
Mr RENCHER opposed the bill on the ground
that he preferred relying on the judgment of an
architect of their own, rather than on that of one
who was unknown to it, and had given an opinion
undei circumstances of opposition, having been
called in to give an opiuwn aga nst the proposed
sliucture and condemn it
Mr. WILLIAMS of Noith Caiolma was in
favor of pulling down what was done, mainly tor
the reason thtt he would substitute a cheaper edi-
nc , though he was of opinion that the weight of
evidence, as to the stability of the proposed build-
in,;, was against the Government r-rchilect.
Mr YELL assented to the views of Mr. Rbn-
cher, and was not disposed to throw away eighty
or a hundred thousand dollars for pulling down
this building, at a time, too, when appropriations
were wanted for the necessities of the Government,
such as the Flouda war, &c Mr Y proceeded,
at some length, to oppose the bill, and aigued with
much warmth in favor of economy and retrench-
ment
Mi EVERETT supported the bill on the strength
of the report of the committee, and the opinions of
the architects who had condemned the building, and
who had no piejudicial bias
Mr TALIAFERRO spoke m opposition to the
bill, and especially to the policy of dispensing with
the materials already'collected, even if the site
shonll be disapproved of, unless it was designed to
construct a palace instead of a suitable house of
business
Mr MERCER briefly advocated the bill, when,
on motion of Mr NAYLOR, the committee rose
and reported, and,
On motion,
The House adjourned
