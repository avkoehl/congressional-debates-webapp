ISTER. THE WORKING OF THE AMMUNITION USED WAS EXCELLENT. THE ONLY FAULT TO BE FOUND WAS IN THE PAPER FUSES USED WITH THE CASE SHOT, AND THEIR INACCURACY, IT SEEMS, CANNOT BE REMEDIED. THE PERCUSSION SHELL WAS IN THIS CASE, AS I HAVE ALWAYS HOUND IT, TRUE TO ITS REPUTATION. I WANT NO BETTER PROJECTILE IN MY CHESTS. THE LOSS IN MATERIEL, I REGRET TO SAY, IS GREAT, AND CONSISTS, IN PART, AS FOLLOWS: THREE 3-INCH RIFLED GUNS, CARRIAGES, AND EQUIPMENTS COMPLETE, 3 SETS DOUBLE LEAD HARNESS, 2 SETS DOUBLE WHEEL HARNESS, 24 LEAD TRACES, 15 WHEEL TRACES, 16 SETS HORSE EQUIPMENTS, AND 20 ARTILLERY HORSES. I BEG LEAVE TO TENDER MY SINCERE THANKS TO THE GENERAL COMMANDING THE THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION FOR THE UNIFORM KINDNESS AND FORBEARANCE WITH WHICH HE TREATED MYSELF AND MY COMMAND DURING THE SHORT TIME I WAS ACTING UNDER HIS ORDERS; AND TO CAPTAIN WEIR AND HIS ENTIRE STAFF, AND TO LIEUTENANT THOMSON, AIDE-DE-CAMP TO THE GENERAL COMMANDING CAVALRY CORPS, WHO ACCOMPANIED THE LEFT WING OF THE ADVANCE, I AM ALSO SINCERELY GRATEFUL. OF THE CONDUCT OF MY CHIEFS OF SECTIONS-LIEUTENANTS CLARK AND WILSON AND FIRST SERGEANT [JAMES E.] TILESTON (ACTING)-I AM DESERVEDLY PROUD. THEY ARE WELL FITTED TO COMMAND MEN OF THE CALIBER AND STAMINA SUCH AS THOSE WHO FOUGHT SO NOBLY AND SO HEROICALLY AT BRANDY STATION ON THE MEMORABLE JUNE 9.

I AM, SIR, VERY RESPECTFULLY, YOUR OBEDIENT SERVANT,

J. W. MARTIN,

CAPTAIN, COMDG. SIXTH INDEPENDENT NEW YORK BATTERY.

FIRST Lieutenant J. H. BELL,

ACTING ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL.

Numbers 371. REPORT OF Lieutenant J. WADE WILSON, WITH NEW YORK BATTERY.

CAMP NEAR FAIRFAX COURT-HOUSE, VA.,

JUNE 21, 1863.

CAPTAIN: IN OBEDIENCE TO YOUR ORDER, I ASSUMED COMMAND OF THE LEFT SECTION OF THE SIXTH INDEPENDENT NEW YORK BATTERY AT WARRENTON JUNCTION, VA., ON JUNE 8, AND CONTINUED THE MARCH THENCE TOWARD KELLY'S FORD, WITHIN A MILE OF WHICH WE BIVOUACKED FOR THE NIGHT. ON THE MORNING OF THE 9TH, PURSUANT TO ORDERS FROM GENERAL GREGG, THROUGH CAPTAIN MARTIN, I DETACHED THE TWO CAISSONS, WITH CORPORALS, AND WITH THE TWO PIECES REPORTED TO COLONEL KILPATRICK, COMMANDING THE FIRST BRIGADE OF GENERAL GREGG'S DIVISION OF CAVALRY, AND WAS PLACED AS SUPPORT TO THE REAR GUARD OF THE COLUMN, MARCHING IN FRONT OF THE REAR REGIMENT OF THE FIRST BRIGADE. THE MARCH WAS CONTINUED WITHOUT INTERRUPTION AND WITH GREAT RAPIDITY UP THE ROAD ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE RAPPAHANNOCK. AT ABOUT 10. 30 A. M. RAPID CANNONADING WAS HEARD AT THE FRONT, AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER AN ORDER WAS RECEIVED TO PASS THE TWO PIECES FROM THE REAR TO THE FRONT OF THE FIRST BRIGADE. LEAVING THE MAIN ROAD TO THE LEFT BY OBLIQUING TO THE RIGHT, I SOUGHT A POSITION ON THE SLOPE OF THE RIDGE WHICH STRETCHED FROM THE FORMER RESIDENCE OF COLONEL THORNE, DECEASED (NOW THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE REBEL GENERAL STUART), TOWARD THE RAPPAHANNOCK, AND BENDING TO THE REAR. AT THIS TIME THE FIGHT FOR THE POSSESSION OF THE HOUSE WAS VERY SPIRITED. TO REACH THE POSITION SOUGHT, I WAS COMPELLED TO CROSS A MORASS, SEVERAL IMMENSE DITCHES, AND A FENCE, ALL OF WHICH WAS ACCOM-
