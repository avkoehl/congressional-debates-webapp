SPEECH OP MR. MEDILL,
OF OHIO,
In tht House of Representatives July 26, 1841—In
Committee of the Whole on thestate of the Union,
on the revenue (or tax) bill
Mr MEDILL rose and said, that as this meas-
ure had been recommended by the Secretary of the
Treasury in hi  report to Congress at the com-
mencement of the session, and was now urged by j
the chairman of the Committee  of Ways and  f
Means as necessary to obtain funds for the purpose
of carrying on the Government, it was certainly
entitled to due consideration    He (Mr   M)vvas
actuated by no wish to throw improper obstacles in
the path of the administration, nor would he with
hold any supply which, m his judgment, was de-
manded by the public interests or exigencies    He
was alone solicitous to perform honestly and faith- i
fully the duty oí a Representative of the people   I
If, therefore, he thought that an increase oí revenue
was called for by the wants of the i reasury or the
interests of the people, he would vote ior n, how
ever he might regret the necessity of imposing ad-
ditional burdens upon the country    As, however,
he intended to record his vute against the bill, jus-
tice to hio constituents as well as to himself com-
pelled him to ask the attention of the committee '
while he stated, as distinctly as the bre *nty imposed  l
upon him by the rules of the House would permit,  '
some of the leasons which determined his course
on the present occasion
If there was any charge (continued Mr   M )
against the late admmistialionmore insisted on than
anothel, and with more effect, boto upon tins floor  '
and throughoutthecountiy,it wasthat ot its alleged
extravagance  and  excessi\p  expendí ute of the
public money    Indeed, this was the pn ,cipal 'opic
discussed during the animated, and, in manv res-
pects, eventful canvass which terminated in its de-
feat, while reform, retrenchment, and economy,
were the chief promises and rewards held out to
the peop'e before thr election by the v ictonous
party    They loudly and vehemently proclaimeu  .
that there had been great waste and e\ ravagance
practised and permitted by that much decried and
calumniated a dministi ation, and everywhere pro    I
claimed that there must be a thorough reform    A  I
new leaf was to be turned ov er,—a new set of books 1
was to be opened    I am a\vare, Mr Cnairman,
that it 1= now claimed that the question mamlv de
cided in that great controversy, p ibhcly carried on
before the neople, was the establishment, or other-
wise, of a Bank of the Tinned S ate¿    Such was '
not the case, at least in the part of the country from
which I come, and I f'- hermie be'ieve that the
recollections and eonvi uons oí other gentlemen if
candidly stated, will be found to correspond with
my own    Even tlose who were known to enter

contrasted with those incurred m the presidential
term of Mr Adams, as the proper economical stand-
ard , thus flattering the people, at least inferen
tially, with the prospect of a reduction of the public
charges to the moderate sum of $13,000,000 These
accusations, then, on the one hand, coupled with
such tempting promises of retrenchment and econ-
omy on the other, more than any or all other con-
siderations, achieved the success which crowned
the efforts of the party now in power E%trava,~
gance was their war-cry, and reform their rally.
It is not my purpose on the present occasion to
examine mto the justice of these charges, but ra-
ther to discuss the measure under consideration,
upon the grounds chosen by the victorious oppo-
nents themselves of the party which has latelv
passed from power And first, let me ask, how
has the confidence of the people, acquired by such
means as those I have described, been requited i
What have become of their reiterated promises of
letrenchment and íeform, with which the popular
ear was captivated"2 The document before us shall
reply. We have here a report from the Secietarv
of the Treasury calling for more money, which,
while it labors to make the most melancholy exhibit
practicable of the poverty ol the public purse, em-
braces not a single proposition to reduce the expen-
ditures of the Government By an inverted process
of logic, the scantiness of our means is even urged
as a pretext for extravagance, instead of a motive
for economy We have still better, or rather still
worse The financial organ of the Government m
this House, (the chaiiman of the Committee of
Ways and Means,) in making his estimates for the
piobable expenditures of the next four years, has
actually based them upon those of the la«t adn m-
tstration, whose alleged extravagance and was e
he and his political friends have so bitterly and
boisterously denounced 1 his is a pregnant fact,
and requires bit little comment When befoie
has it ever been proposed to make wnat we have
condemned our example, and se'ect for our model
those whom we have denounced with all the enei gy
of an apparently virtuous indignation 1 Instead of
taking the §13 000,000 of Mr Adams's administia
tion as his s andaid, the honorable chairman pre-
fers taking the average of the last four years, which
is more than double' The e estimates, we have
a right to suppose, are approved of by the Secretary of
the Treasury, who was among the loudest during
the canvass in denouncing the alleged extravagance
of the late admims ixtiun, which he now takes as
his model i Moieover, it is neither by accident,
nor for jusinable rea oris, that these four years
have been chosen as ti e s'andird of expenditure
foi ibis economical administration They have
been selected ior the very reason that they furnish
the highest annual rate No small mgenui v nas
been exercised m the discrimination To under-
stand why if e expenditures weie highe- then than
the present conduit n ot affairs justre-, a brief ie-
view of attendant circumstances is demanded.
The close of General Jackson's administration
and the begmn ng c f that of Mr Van Buren weie
characterized by that extiaordmary mama of spe-
culation, engendered by am' engendering a bioate 1
currency and high prices, which ga/e an impulse
to every speciesof extravagance, pub'icand private
Every tiling was viewed through a magnifying
mtdium, and eveiv thing conducted upon an ex
asgerated scale The effect was mesistible upon
Con gress as well as mcLv id uals, ard accordingly, m
the two years 1338 and 1S37 the appropriations ex
ceeded the es'imates submitted by the Secretary of
the Treasury as sufficient to meet the wants of the
Government, $^,708 813 47! Sir, it is not neces-
saiy that 1 should recal to t jiscommit'ee the effects
of that inebriating di aught, of vvhicnwe ail partook
more or less and the sj mptoms of which are still
visible in the general languoi which pervades the

the Circean cup which was presented to the lips of
all But the vears of bloated plenty should not be

If the Secretary of the Treasury is really m
search of an economical standard of expenditure
furnished by a democratic administration, here,
then, is one, by his own show mg, which is well
worthy of his regard and ím'íation He is not
even asked to go back, in his economical re
searches, to the fedeial dynasty which preceded it
During the same period the receipts of the Treas-
ury from customs, lands, and other sources, weie
$107,065,601 39, oi $26,766,401 10 annually It
is clear, therefore, that the economy then prac-
tised was not a virtue ot necessity A pretty con-
siderable margin was left, to employ a financial
phrase If the public disbursements afterwards
increased, that augmentation is capable of an easy
explanation The public debt, which had been
contracted m a war undertaken to vindicate the
national honor and rights of our country, having
been paid off, and the retpipts of the Treasury,
stimulated by the causes already mentioned, in-
creasing rapidly during the second term of Gen-
eral Jackson's administration, to an annual ave-
rage of more than §¡34,000,000,—it was to be ex-
pected—it was indeed scarcely to be avoided—that
the expenditures of the Government would feel
the effect of an overflowing Treasury Experi-
ence has shown (what, indeed, reason would
teach) that an abundant income leads necessarily
to an abundant outlay, both from the fulness of
Jhe mean , and the danger and inconvenience of
an accumulating surplus  What is true of indi-
viduals, s equally so of Governments—expendi-
ture is regulated by income With abundant
means, opportunities and even pretexts of expense
are sought and devised Accordingly, most lib-
eral appropriations were made by Congress foi
coast survey clearing out rivers, improving har-
bors, ilc , vihile spacious and duiable buildings
have been erected at the seat ot Government and

Tne perennial stream which w as flowing into
the Treasury with increasing abundance, led also
to the passage of additional pension laws The
pension list, which in 1832 amounted to £1,237,
704 33, exclusive of invalids, swelled in 1833 to
$4,485,383 20 This was the gift of a grateful
people to the surviving remnants oí that glorious
struggle, whose cost it was deemed illiberal to
count, when such abundan' means of requnal
were at hand In this all parties concuried with
a generous emu ation Furthermore, theie was
pait from 1833 to 1839, mclus ve, tor the purchase
of Indian lands, $15,535,74¿ 96, and for the re-
moval of Indians, ard the wars consequent there-
on, ovei and above the ordinary appropriations for
the War Department in the three jears 1836, 1837,
and '1838, 'he sum of $17,884,017 57 These
items exhibit an expendituie of more than foity
millions ot do'lars lor extraordinary pui poses, of
a piofiable and enduring character, foreign to
the cus omary objects of Guvernnert outlay
They ought rather to be called an m vestment
which will sooner or later repay both principal
and in erest The land thus purchased is the
property of the American people, and is, even m
a pecuniary point of view, far more valuable than
the consideralion for which it was obtained But
it 's narrow and short sighted to regard only the
proceeds of the sale of the lands thus acquired
in our estimates of the advantages accruing there-
from Tre increase of population, stiength, and
safety, secured by the extinction of the Indian
title, must not be lost signt ol, no more than the
settlement of embarrassing controyersies, and the
preserva'ion of those -bong-ma! tribes who have
strong claims upon our sympathy and protection.
To return to the ques ion cf economy, it
would be as just to consider the amount paid
for the acqu sition of Lou siarn as an item in the
ordmary expendí ures of Mi Jefferson's adminis-
tration, ?s to regard these outlays in that light
These e/traordir ary sources of disbursement are
now exhausted, and the true wants of the Govern-
ment are reduced to those for ordinary expendi-
ture    The Secretary does not even pretend that
