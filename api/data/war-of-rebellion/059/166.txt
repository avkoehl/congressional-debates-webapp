of men, and he should aim to get to Purdy and the Hatchie before Forrest. Send orders to him by telegraph to Paducah, also a letter across the country to Savannah; also get orders to Grierson to follow Forrest close and attack at all hazards, and follow as long as possible. Copies of the orders to be sent to Generals Hurlbut and Brayman. Telegraph Brayman I see no necessity to re-enforce Columbus if Hicks beat off Forrest with his 400 men. I want Veatch to cut off his retreat, as he certainly will.

I have just returned from an inspection of the bridge at Larkin's. Will go to Chattanooga to-night. Telegraph me there.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

Just received the following:

SMITHLAND, KY.,

March 27, 1864.

Forrest has fallen back to Mayfield with 4,000 men. Scouts from off Tennessee River report the rebels on this side trying to get back; passed close to them as thee lay in ambush; also, they came to farthest bank of river, 30 in number; the gun-boats cleared them away. All quiet this side of the Tennessee thus far. I have endeavored to communicate with General Veatch, at Fort Henry, and with Generals Hurlbut and Grierson by telegraph.

LOVELL H. ROUSSEAU.

NASHVILLE, March 27, 1864.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE:

We are in receipt of information that gun-boat Numbers 33 arrived at Smithland at 5.30 p. m. on the 26th instant from Paducah; reports all quiet there. Forrest lying in or near the city. City partially destroyed. Forrest reported to have 4,000 men with him. Rebel Brigadier-General Thompson killed at 12 m. on the 26th instant. Forrest sent flag of truce and demanded of Colonel Hicks the surrender of the fort; Colonel Hicks refused. The gun-boats commenced throwing shells up Broadway. It is supposed Forrest will attack Colonel Hicks. It is stated rebels are crossing Tennessee Rivere. I send 500 men and one battery to re-enforce Fort Donelson at 11.30 to-day, as it is apprehended Forrest will attack that place.

LOVELL H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, March 27, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Paducah:

Notify General Veatch that after being satisfied that Forrest cannot cross the Tennessee and Cumberland he should push rapidly to Savannah, and move to Purdy to cut off Forrest's retreat. If Veatch has gone up river this morning go after him, if possible.

Major-General.
