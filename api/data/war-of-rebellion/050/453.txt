woods, not knowing where to go, and which would have fallen into the hands of the enemy.

Our loss in killed wounded, and missing is as follows:

[Command.]	 Killed.	 Wounded.	 Missing.	 Total.

Brigade staff	 -	 2	 -	 2

92nd Illinois	 2	 26	 2	 30

98th Illinois	 3	 30	 2	 35

123rd Illinois	 1	 13	 10	 24

17th Indiana	 4	 9	 3	 16

72nd Indiana	 10	 23	 2	 35

18th Battery	 1	 2	 -	 3

Total	 21	 105	 19	 145

Among the killed is the brave and generous McMurtry, captain Company I, Seventy-second Indiana. He fell in the thickest of the fight, in the full discharge of his duties.

Among the wounded whose loss will be greatly felt, not only in his regiment but in the brigade and division, is the steady, cool, and resolute Colonel Funkhouser, of the Ninety-eighth Illinois, who fell while leading his men most gallantly in the charge on Sunday afternoon.

Others are deserving of special mention here, but already this report is too long, and Colonel Wilder, who commanded the brigade during all the time reported, will, I have no doubt, mention their names and services in a manner that will do them the amplest justice.

A number of prisoners were taken at different times; 35 in the last charge on Sunday, the 20th.

All of which is respectfully submitted.
