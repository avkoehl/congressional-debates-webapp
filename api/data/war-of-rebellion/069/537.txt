HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, June 3, 1864-7.20 a. m.

General MEADE:

I am informed by General Burnside that he has taken a prisoner from Hill's corps, on my right, I have 2 from Johnson's and 1 from Rodes' division. General Burnside, I believe, is forcing in the enemy's left. I hear of the enemy's troops moving to our left. The enemy's cannon throw shot into Bethesda Church from around nearly [in a] semicircle, but do not do much harm. Prisoners all state that we have at least part of Ewell's and Hill's corps here.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, June 3, 1864-8 a. m.

General MEADE:

General Crawford has just sent me in 2 prisoners taken on the picket-line in his front belonging to Field's division, of Longstreet's corps. They say their main line is along the main road, as I understand them, just west of Gaines' mill-pond and creek running south. General Burnside with one battery has driven the enemy of the Shady Grove road on their left, and we are preparing to swing our line so as to press them back. Or line has been very extended, reaching very near to the Via house.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.

I have moved to ammunition train this morning 1 mile east of Cold Harbor. The from here to our corps is almost impassable. If you expect to use it much, there is about 400 yards that should be well repaired. Before moving the train the enemy gave us a shell which exploded and burned one wagon.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Quartermaster.
