the member mean by Ins tetm Fedeiahsft I desire
of him to define that appellation ' And I charged
that it was evaded, left undefined, but a prescription
proffered suitable onl> for his own case The
Globe also omits my rejoinder to the member's
'next occasion anodyne.'' It was, that his prescrip-
tions, whether in the shape of an emetic, cathartic,
oranodjne, should onlj be admimstercu heieafter
to those who confided m his skill "]
