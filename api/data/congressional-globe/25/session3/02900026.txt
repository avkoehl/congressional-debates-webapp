APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Public Printing—Mr. Morris.
Senate
try and amongst the people, their own peculiar
tenets, opinions, and doctrines, and all they asked I
of the Government in the exercise of this, their ¡
undoubted right, was protect jn and safety for
then persons and property, irom mobs and un  i
lawful violence                                                              j
But lie had seen with regret and alarm, Con-
gress, as a public body, orde nig the punting of
documents and waters caicuhieu to piomote the
particular political views and doctuneaof indivil- .
uals or pames in Congress     it wai> true he had
gone witn tne practice and the ade in this matter,
when the   aocuments  'o bo  pri"ted   «ere those
emxnatmg íioi i soi le pait ot int Government, 01
from a committee or Congress, and .verc designed
as the foundation of legislative acfon     But he |
thought eyen  a  practice ol that kird was better
followed in its bleach than its observance, b.it
when we are called upon to print a foteig i docu-
ment, he  thought it time to pause a id reflect on
the natuie anu extent of this business     Not being
m his seat at the time it was moved, in the news- |
paper in  wimh he list heard of this Older the
mover was made to say that " large as the num-
' ber was he piopos^d to have punted, he thougnt I
'he might ventuie to say m advance that eveiy '
' Senalot would have ap jIí.iIiüi s foi more copies
'than would ful to l.is s   ire "    I'his might be '
tiue, but if those who would apply foi the bioic
really thought it useful and valúame, they wouid
puicnase it n in i ¡it 11 power, at the pi ice of adobar
or two, and I! this w is tne < ase, pi i vate ímeiest,
whicn was always on the look oat, and w is eigle-
eyed,  wou'l at once i'iduce some bnousellei  to
{ uolislt an edition uf ilus vvoik, tin ugh a tal less
mi uber than thn ty tnuusai d siiuuld bedeman led
1 he f n t was,   i id  he well ki tw it, those public
documeits  punted by orJei   weie seldom  lead,
and lie wou'd ventuie to say on the present occa
sion, mat it the tuuty thousand oí tue-.e salt doc-
uments should be punted, not one thud ol the
membeis of Congress themselves would evei read
one, and they would be lead by a. far less pi )por-
tion of the community at laige
Theie was another view ot this subject which
uttuck ¡us mind as very ob|tctionable to the pi lilt-
ing ot this document, as well as many othets whiih
had been ordered by both Houses of Congiess
Theie unlets «e always uncle with the pioiesscd

And how wis this done' Wt tax Uie people at
laige, say $,2"0 000, though he be'ieved the books
and punting onleied by the two Houses at ihe
last session of Con,i ess would amount to a much
larger sum, yet 'hese documents and books, when
piloted, became, ipso J uto, the puvate piopeity of

of our own policy, and are compelled to draw upon |
foseign sources, as a foundation for the legislation I
of the country     It may all beiight enough in this
cace, and at this time, but the example, he feared,
might lead to very improper results     Suppose a [
m ]outy should happen in Congress, or even m
this branch, who desired to introduce into the coun-
try a foreign system, oi   the piactice of foreign
Governments, heieditary succession, or titles of
nobility, and to enlighten the people as to the great
1 enefi s which imagination might suppose would
issult fiorn such measures, tney might order the
pri'Kng for distribution, fiom  the example we
have set, anv number of documents favorable to
such a scheme, to prepaie the peoole to submit to
a bid which was aftei wards to be  brought in for
such   purpose     He  would   much   rather let the
f,5Q,000 which he apprehended this printing would
cost, remain in the pockets of the people, to pin-
chase such book" as then ¡udgni'iit or their fancy
should suggest     He did not believe this Govern
mentoaght toexpeid money for any such purpose
i I eie is (said Mi   M ) auothei and still moie
picssiug objection to th s oidei foi  printing, be
cause it comes homediiectly to the í'ieasm y itself,
and to the mevis  we ha'e foi  the discharge of
existing jiist  demands agams'   the Government
The extiavug u ces of the Government had become
a by word  md a song, and the coiiuptions which
such a sysrem v as inttc iucing tnrmgh the conn
ti y was alarming     Ihe nsfound n<^ defalcations

v/as, he considered, a pirt and parce' of thn sys-
tem of extriviguit and mmroper appiopnations,
and in these pining times of talking aoout economy

scmeuimg Wioiig «-omewnere all seemed now to
admit; and, in his opinion, the fault was manly,
if not altogether, tobe found in the legislation and
acts of Congress He had confined h'S views to
the household economy of the body, to their fur-
niture, the diess of their chambers, and their pin
money alone, and he hoped they would begin the
work of reformation and ¡etrenchment at home;
he thought they had " ialtcd" the people qui'e
sufficient in this branch of the public expenditures
without adding to the amount ¿50,0C0 more or less
foi printing this salt document He hoped the
motion to ¡escird the cider would pievail.and that
the Senate would sustain him in a call for the yeas
and nays on the vote; foi, should he vote alone,
he wisned his name to ap¡ ear against this extrav-
agant and extraodmary expenditure of the public
money.
The yeas and nays weie ordered.
Mr M , in reply to Mr Benton, said that he
had not attended very closely to the observations
of the gentleman at the commencement of his
aigument After explaining his views, he should
feel disposed to be satisfied with the decision of the
Senate, and it was not his habit to again trouble the
House, except new matter was brought forward,
or his lemarks wtre m.sunderstood, so as to pro-
duce a misienrecentation of them But he now
unde-stood the gentleman to chatge those opposed
to th.s pnniirg as being inimical to a repeal of the
duty on sa r, and thus against the ir terests of the
agricultural classes, and that the people needed
iniormation to judge of the piopnety of this repeal.
Mi M said the people he repiesented understood
veiy well their mteiests on this subject, they were
in favor of a repeal of all duties on arbcies of
necessity used bv the g^eat mass of the people—
tne labonng classes—such as salt, sugai, coal, and
breadstuffs, but they did not consider the priceof
salt as onerous or oppressive No one, he ti usted,
who examined this subject, not even a school boy,
could be made to believe that the duty of five or
six cents on a bushel of imported salt increased
the price of the domestic aiticle The western
countiycou'd manufacture a sufficient quantity
foi their en ire consump ion; and the article was
sold at as Iowa pure as anyone could desire,
lie thought—he coul 1 not speak with perfect cer-
tainty —that a bushel of domestic salt (fifty pounds)
had been purchased, for years past, at an average
price of forty to six y cents, and those who used
the foieign aiticle, used it fiom choice, not neces-
sity, and he did not thnk that it was geneially
undeistood that fifty pounds of the foreign article
was more valuable to the agucultural class than
the same epic ntity of the domestic The far mug
interest of the West, he thought, would never
comp'un ot the pace of salts while they could
pinchase three pounds of salt foi one pound of
flour This had been the case in th  West for
some time past For hi nseif, he repelled the
i harge tnat this, or any act of his in this body or
else vl er", was done with a view, ei'her directly
oi a due'' ly, to oppress, oi aiiect irj rnusly, the
0ur ul u-al 11 iss— i c'ass amongst which he had
l>c n raise!, and to whom lie belonged He was

nnutii —in Limon t win h the d Ly i rl tie

Hi vvou'd go further, and repeal the i' 'ty on
sugir, coal,at d bieadstu'Is, t orne, ¡ nd all o nei
article , even coarse woolens, .vhich \,eie usal by
the pom and lab jrmg class He consideied some
of these duties almost as unjust as to tax those
classes foi the air and sunshine which fell to their
lot, ai d if the revenue would suffci in consequence
of this report, he would increase it by an additional
duty on ameles of luxury, taste, and fashion —
articles which p'oduced extiavaganee, and not
economy in th s co intry—ind h  v. r old lay duties
only to meet the piooer and neccssaiy warts of
tl e Govemn ent, but never foi r rotection
