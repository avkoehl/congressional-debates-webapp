Captain and Aide-de-Camp.

NASHVILLE, January 12, 1863.

General ROSECRANS:

I can send a small expedition out at any time. General Stanley has but 600 cavalry. If the train waiting for the escort is delayed, I can send three regiments of infantry and four pieces of artillery in addition to the cavalry. You have one of my batteries with you (Beebe's). Believe, from the best information we can get, the enemy have at least 2,000 mounted infantry and eight pieces of artillery. By actual count there is not less than 4,000 within supporting distance of each other.

General ROSECRANS:
