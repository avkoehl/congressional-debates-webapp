bu' this vould 1 e lo adopt the ol I and exploded
puneiple, at all time, dangerou but ] re eminently
s ai th s time, nh n -uch loose and dangerous
conceptions of the Constitution are <tbn ad m the
land If the argument is goon tn on< case, it is
good in ill similar cases If this Govetnmeiitm iy
íriterície with anv cne of the domestic mstitutions
of the ¡States, on the ground oí promoting the gene-
ral welfare, it may with others    If it may bestow
privileges to eontrol them, it may also appropriate
money for the same purpose; and thus a door
might be opened to an interference with State in-
stitutions, of wluch we of a certain section ought at
this time to be not a lntle jealous.
The argument might be pushed much farther.
We not only offer to confer great and important
privileges on the banks to be ¡.elected, but, in turn,,
ask them to stipulate to comply -with certain condi-
tions, ihegobject of which is to bring them under
the supervision and control of this Government
It might be asked, where is the right to purchase or
assume such supervision or control? It might be
repeated that ihey are State institutions, incorpo-
rated solely for State purposes, and to be entirely
under State contiol, and that all supervision on
our part is m violation of the rights of the States
It might be aigued that such supervision or control
is calculated to weaken the control ot the States
over their own institutions, and to render them less
subservient to their peculiar and local interests, for
the promotion of which they were established, and
too subservient to other, and, perhaps, conflicting
interests, which might feel but little sympathy with
those of the States. But I forbear. Other, and not
less urgent, objections claim my attention To
dilate too much on one would necessarily sacrifice
the claim of others
I next object, that, whatever may be the right to
enter into the proposed bargain, the mode in which
it is proposed to make it is clearly unconstitu-
tional , if I rightly comprehend it. I am not certain
that I do, but, if I understand it rightly, the plan
is for the Secretary of the Treasury to select
twenty-five State banks, as described in the substi-
tute, which are to be submitted to the two Houses
to be confirmed, or rejected, by their joint resolu-
tions, without the approval of the President; in the
sime mode as Ihey would a_ppomt a chaplain, or
establish a joint rule for the government of their
pioceedmgs
In acting on the joint resolution, if what I sup-
pose be intended, each House would have the right,
of coarse, lo strike from it the name of any bank
and insert another, which would in fact vest in the
1 wo Houses tie uncontro'lable right of making the
selection Now, if ihts be the mode proposed, as
I infer fiom the silence of the mover, tt is a plain'
and palpable violation of the Constitution. The
obvious intention is, to evade the veto power of
the Exetutive, which cannot be, without an mtrac-
t on of an express provision of the Constitution,
drawn up with the utmost care, and intended to
prevent the possibility of evasion It is contained
111 the 1st article, 7th section, and the last clause,
which I a«k the Secretary to read
["livery order, resolution, or vote, to which the
concurrence of the Senate and Heuse of Represen-
tatives m ly be necessary, (except on a question
of adjournment) shall be piesentecl to the Presi-
dent of the United States, and before the same
shall take effect, sdi ill be approved by him, or be-
ing disapproved by him, shill be repassed by two-
thnds of the Senate and House of Representa-
tives, according to Ihe rules and limitations pre-
scribed in the case of a bill."]
Nothing can be more explicit, or full. It is no
more possible to evade the Executive veto, on any
)otnt vote, than 111 the passage of a bill The veto
was vested in him notonly to protect his own pow-
ers, but as an additional guard to the Constitution.
I am not the advocate of Executive power, which
I have been often compelled to resist oí late, when
exten led beyon 1 us prop-r limits, as I shall ever
be prepared to do when it is Nor am I the ad-
1 oe ate of Leg slative or Judicial. I stand ready
to protect all, within the sphere assigned by the
Constitution, and to resist them beyond To this
explic it ?nd compieheiiMve provision of ihe Con-
stitution, m protection of the veto, there but a sin-
gle except on, ¡exalting, by necessary implication,
from anotner portion of the instrument, not less
explicit, which authorizes each House to establish
the rules of its proceedings Under this provisión
the two Houses have full and uncontro'lable au-
thority within the limits of their respective walls,
and over those subject to their authority, m their
official character To that extent, they may pass
joint votes and resolutions, without the approvitf of
