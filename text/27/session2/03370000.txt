Why had not ihe House impeached this officer before this
time, if he was a faithless officet, a treacherous man, neglect-
ful of his duty? Had they not the power, the sole power,
lodged in no other department of Government, to impeach him?
He would ask the gentlern m fiom North Caiolina, [Mr stan
ly,j whom he had never known stop at any thing which his
duly called him to do why be had not before this moment de
manded an impeachment of this officer? That wasthe legnlar
way If they sa d that no money should be paid they abolisned
the office, tuey broke up the founda ions of (healmmistiative
policy of this Governme t He thought the Whiss were takme:
a very seveie responsibih y on themselves Were they not
bum by thetr duty, unless they intended to break asunder
this Gov eminent, to appiopnate the compensation to the va

view to enable the Exeoutive '0 execute ihe laws which they
themselves made¡

Mi GRDEN movedto amend the item by teducing the sa

"For salary ot the Tnst Auduor $¿500 and tl e comouwa

Mi G said it was not his intention to detain the committee
with a long speech butto draw attention to the salary of this
officei     It he had been an incompetent and unfaithful officer,
he ought to be lemoved    As the gentleman fiom North Caro

him under a contract Now, either the gentleman wastont.stly
mistaken m the motion he had made, or else this was 3 false a d
hollow hearted evasion of the promises of reform so hberafty
made by the party to whi£h he belonged—an appearance, Wpie
tence of retrenchment, which must be wholly nugatory -There
was but one other way of interpreting the motion of uie^entlé-
man and that was, as an attempt, by a side blow, to dnite a
particular individual from office, probably with a view to put
s >me other ia his place As it would have no real elfectlrt
touching the salary, the movement must have some political
purpose in view Mr G was neither the accuser of the Fir-sf
Auditor nor tho defender ofhis crimes, if crimes he had com
mitted, that was not now the question AncUhiswasbutarttx'-

But again If thesei'SOO were to be deducted *rom his sa>ary,
was the deduction tobeprora'a, andappl edto tnatpoitwn of
the salary due the present year' This was, m fact, only re-
enacting ihe obnoxious principle of the bankrupt law, which
sti tick at conti acts, and interfered with veste 'rights It was a
blow at the office a blow at Lxecuuve prerogative, lust as
much as the motion made before to 6 rlke out the whole salary.
It went on the doctrine that a ma]oruy in Con'.ress may at any
time withhold the salary of any and all officers of the Govern-
ment—the judicial officers as well as any others Yes, establish,
this doctrine, and Conerees could at any time drive from the
bench of the Supieme Couitany Judge who had made himself
obnoxious by m tipnghtar d feailess discharge of his duty It
was only to declue his-col duct aibitiary and tyrannical, and
