COMPROMISE ACT
I
Mi   PPNPON observed that some days ago,
in the discussion of a bill then before the Senate,
¡I he had occasion to take some notice ot the eom-
I  piomise act, and  he then made a statement of
what had  passed in relation to it between him-
self and a gentleman who was then a Senator
from the State of New Jersey, and head of the
Committee on Manufactuies    Since making that
statement he had reason to address a letter to the
gentleman whose name he mentioned (Governor
Dickenson) on the subject, and hi   hud  received
an answer which he would read to  the Senate,
and then let that answer stand as his statement
