Mr. WASHBURNK, of IUinms. i suggm ji
;; an amendment by inserting a provision that the
1 amount shall not exceed the minimum price of the ^
■ public lands.
'i The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman from '
Pennsylvania yield for that purpos-*? I1
j, Mr.TEIAYKR. I cannot. |,
Ii Mr. WILSON. I desire to ask the geut'eman I!
j! whether he knows the precise amount paid to the '!
'J Government for th^ee lands. i;
H Mr. VVASHBURNE, oflllinuw Thephram- l;
.1 ologv of thcbul is p^cuhar. ;
Mr. THAYER, The Legislature of*h<*State
of Ohio 'hits j>a£f ed a joint resolution leqi.nvtg
Congress to take this action. The Cotnanue.* on
Private Land Claims has given the matter a full
investigation, and is convinced that the passage of
the bill is a matter of simple justice, and at nil
events can do no possible harm. It simply au-
thorises the Secretary of the Interior to ascertain
whet was the unimproved value of these lands,
leaving the whole Subject open for the future ac-
tion of Congres. .
M \ WASI-f liURNE, of Illinois. It seems to
me that the object which the gentleman seeks to
attain is not accomplished by the bill. Hossaya
that all they desue or expect is a repayment of
the amount originally paid, but the bill does not
fix >r m that way. if the gentleirmn will look at
it ciuefully he will see that the bill does not curry
out Lio idea, i su'jgest that he add this proviso:
p-. , lit. That a ^r. nt^r n:nrt\mt "h.'iIJ not be allowed
than what rht! Goveimn-ait leeeived.
Mr. THAYHR. The bill only proposes that
the i-oimnroved value of this tract ot land shall
be ascertained bv the assessment and valuation
of a commission", to be appointed by the Secie-
tary of the li5te .  r. 1 Mibmit to the gentlenuin
from Illinois tl^o -t wiH ne time enough to restrain
any .mfuoper c.c ion when a bill is reported tor
the comnensatioii of the narties.
:-".r WASLirrJRNlI, of Illinois. Tho gentle-
ma! e, ill no? o!jl to this proviso:
/'( ; i.\d, Th it m .• • eve* 1 --lad! the Government be U-
tu.:-; , > nav a yic u- . .tnou.<L than they received foi s>;u{J
la;-.! .
M:. TflAVER. I av! afraid my biU will not
bt ofhuu-h US'1 ii that amendment is iocoi porated
m it. At any i. f , 1 h.tvo iio light to accept it.
I ho ie the loll v.'i'i h<t a 'owed t«) pass in iis pres-
ent .-hope, becanf.e no possnde injury can accrue
to th  Ciouiri: •":< >.v. I must therefore decline to
yield to the gctuh man to offer the amendment.
Mr. WAS[iniJHN[J, of fliinois. The gentle-
in m need nota-^cfj.t the amendment, hut he can
allow me to oil 'r it, and the House to taken vote
upon i£.
. THAYEIl. 1 do not think I should be
jus.iaed in doing \
Mr. LE BLOTsi>. I hope the amendment of
the gentleman from lilniois will not pievail, and
I think thai, if hr v, til look at ilie matter for a sin-
gle moment h[ '1 see th it his proposition would
doi/i ov the t ffic-m *y <>f the bill, and for this rea-
son: the object of" no hii! is notio pay Mr. Sweet-
zei,nut for th" luipo^e of indemnifying the
pan, A'iio w. .e .he peichasers under the Gov-
ernment. I suppose tuefjC parties paid ^*2 50 an
aete for Lheir \, > ds, fora portion of them had been
i>iven to the State of Ohio for the purpose of
budding a canal. Ohio letmned the alternate sec-
t!Ous, A pm t ol the l.uid^woro bought from the
Govt.iiment di'fc'.ly e! ^'2 50 an acre. The bal-
ance of the la;.u^, was purchased from the State
at ! 'v same ra'e. Now, if Mr. Sweptzer's jullg-
mei t creditor, who can now oust the parties m
po^-e^sum, i-i w dung to accept f/0 an acre, that
v/ii, lie petfectly s'liisuo.tory to the piesenthold-
er^of tiiese lends. They do not care anything
al\ ut it, hut Air. Sweetzor, 1 apprehend, would
b. t,i> billing t<> take that; and why ? Simply be-
ca'o e he would be rec-iving ^2 50 an acre when
the ;u ids ore i-aiiv wDrth more. The object of
the loi'l r; to i-ave these parties in possession of
th< lends wine1! tney hove already improved. I
thu.k it i^ but simple justice on the part of the
thvi. val Government to make tlmse parties whole,
ami let them set.  u the lands they have already
imptoved. Th-* Government, in the first place,
seed the land * when they had no title to them and
m:\hv not to I . ve soht t;ier i. But liavmg sold
ihtin and got y} o0 an acre, the gentleman pro-
po -'i'S to pay bach that .mm w ubout even interest,
it ;.-ems to me that that would be injustice to
tb'^e pai ties, uiij 'hat the tun end merit ought not to
ruov'tsii. I hooo 'he hhl wuilpas^in the shape in
vvhjch it come:? the committee, and when
the commission ehnll have gone upon the land
mm assessed l-a.* value of it in an unimpiovrd
cond.tion, the e^o wi.'i come before the House
for fiituie action in making an appropriation.
Mr. THAYKR. I demand the previous ques-
tion.
'.he SPEAKER ordeied toilers; and appointed
Me -• :s. W AsuBi'HN'e. of Illinois, arid Le Hi.oxo.
