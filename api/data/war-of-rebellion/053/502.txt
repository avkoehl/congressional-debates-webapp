MORTON, August 17, 1863.

(Received Richmond, 19th.)

General S. COOPER:

Your dispatch in relation to General Bragg's department and mine is made unintelligible by the operators. Is West Tennessee in General Bragg's department or mine?

J. E. JOHNSTON.

MORTON, August 17, 1863.

Brigadier General DANIEL RUGGLES,

Columbus, Miss.:

The expedition which crossed at Rocky Ford was at last accounts moving toward Oxford and Water Valley.

Three Federal regiments left Yazoo City on the morning of the 15th, reached the railroad at Durant Station that afternoon, and moved northward along it, supposed for the purpose of uniting with the first-named expedition. It was followed by Whitfield's brigade. It is important that you should give all the aid in your power to Whitfield and Chalmers.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,Chattanooga, Tenn., August 17, 1863.

Major General JOSEPH WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: Several desertions have taken place from the army, and it is deemed highly important that some steps should be taken to check this evil. You will instruct you cavalry pickets to increase their vigilance and arrest all absent without proper leave. No furlough is granted to any soldier to go in the lines of the enemy or trans-Mississippi country. The different fords on the river should be carefully guarded.

I am, genera, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
