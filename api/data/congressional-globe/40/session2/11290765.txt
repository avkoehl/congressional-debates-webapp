GO VEEN MENTAL POLICY.
Mr. DAVIS submitted the following resolu-
tions ; which were ordered to be printed and
lie on the table:
Whereas the people of the United States are griev-
ously burdened by an enormous public debt, and a
system of unequal and unjust t&xatiom to rake money
to pay the interest upon it, and from time to time
Eortions of the principal, and their industry and
usiness have been greatly disorganized and depressed
by the ravages and destruction of the war, and by
misgovernment and unnecessary and wasteful ex-
penditures since its termination; now to inaugurate
some measures for their relief:
llait resolved, That Congress ought atonee to cease
its war upon the Constitution, the President, the Su-
preme Court, and the white people of the southern
States, and give sedulous and faithful attention to
its own appropriate duties.
Resolved, That the poople of the southern States
ought not to be further obstructed by Congress in
their eft'orts to resume fully their proper relations
te the Government of the United States, by the form-
ation of their respective governments and laws
under the Constitution, and to regain their former
prosperity by giving their undivided attention, time,
and energies to their industries and business.
Resolved^ That Congress ought immediately, earn-
estly, and in the best faith to enter upon a thorough
system of retorm, retrenchment, and economy in the
administration and expenditures of the Government
in every branch of the public service.
Resolved, That the Kreedmen's Bureau ought to be
forthwith abolished, that the people may be relieved
from taxes to the amount of the annual teng of mil-
lions which thcyhaveto pay for itsmaintenance, and
both the black and white races ot the South be left
to choose their own fields of labor and to struggle for
their own support.
Resolvc:l. That to relieve the people from the pay-
ment of otlv r taxes to the amount of $50,000,000 an-
nually, the stauding army should be reduced to
twenty thousand men, rank and file.
Resolved, That to save the further heavy drafts
upon the Treasury caused by the reconstruction
policy of Congress, it ought to be abandoned, and the
acts organizing it be repealed.
liesolved, That the unconstitutional tax on cotton
ought to be wholly abolished, and the tax collected
be refunded to those who paid it.
Resolved, That spirits, tobacco, and luxuries ought
to be so taxed as to produce the largest amounts of
revenue from tliom; and to this, and as well as to
prevont frauds and perjuries without limit, and to
obviate a most complicated and expensive system of
assessment and collection, whisky should be taxed
at the rate of titty cents per gallon, to be paid by the
distiller.
Resolved, That the bonds of the United States held
by individuals and corporations ought to be assessed
with a reasonable rate of tax.
Retolved, That the necessaries of life, and raw
materials and other articles entering into manufac-
tures and ship-building, ought to be subjected to the
lowest rates of duty that the financial necessities of
the Government will permit.

each sale was made, the time when it was made, the
time when the proceeds of each sale were covered

ROBERT M. PATTON.
Mr. STEWART. I move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of the bill for the
relief of Robert M. Patton. It is very import-
ant that this bill should be acted on, so that
the Committee on the Judiciary, to whom a
large number of similar cases have been referred,
may know what the action of the Senate is to
be. The action of the Senate on the case of
Patton will be a guide to the committee iu
other cases.
