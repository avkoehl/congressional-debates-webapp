direction of the Stono River, and I presume a small battery has been erected there to guard that approach to the city.

Of the garrison of Castle Pinckney I cannot judge very well. Of that for Fort Moultrie and the other batteries on Sullivan's Island I should judge the number to be about 800. On Morris Island about 500. At Fort Johnson about 100, which will probably be increased with the completion of the second battery to 200.

The temper of the authorities seems to have changed for the better since Mr. Hayne and Mr. Gourdin have been in Washington. The proposition to supply fresh meat and vegetables was made by Governor Pickens on the 19th, but declined by Major Anderson on the following day. A supply of fresh meat and vegetables that had been sent down yesterday by the South Carolina quartermaster-general was returned. In the letter declining the proffered supply Major Anderson requested Governor Pickens to allow the camp women and children to go to New York in the next steamer, and to allow a lighter to come down to take them and their effects to the steamer as she passes. No answer has yet been received to this request. The temper of the common people is not, however, so easily changed from the high pitch of excitement to which it has been wrought to a suddenly conciliatory course, the reason for which they do not perceive.

Our hopes for a pacific solution of the present difficulties are very much increased since Lieutenant Talbolt's return.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Captain, Engineers.
