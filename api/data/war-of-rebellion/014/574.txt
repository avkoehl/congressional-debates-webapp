HEADQUARTERS, June 5, 1862.

Major W. H. STEVENS,Chief Engineer Army of Northern Virginia:

MAJOR: The only way by which the enemy can convey heavy artillery from the Chickahominy is the York River Railroad. It has occurred to me that he is constructing a railroad battery, probably plated with iron, to push along the road and sweep the country. That may be the object of his blind on the railroad. Can you not take a position, probably where General Toombs is stationed, and erect a battery to oppose him? If we can hold him on the railroad he cannot advance by his present front, I think, for I do not see how he can provision his troops. If we could construct a railroad battery, though, plated and protected with a heavy gun, it would probably be preferable to a fixed gun. What do you think of its practicability? Please let me know what progress you are making and the condition of affairs.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
HEADQUARTERS, June 5, 1862.

Colonel J. GORGAS,Chief of Ordnance Department:

COLONEL: Is there a possibility of constructing an iron-plated battery, mounting a heavy gun, on trucks, the whole covered with iron, to move along the York River Railroad? Please see what can be done. See the Navy Department and officers. If a proper one can be got up at once it will be of immense advantage to us. Have you any mortars that we could put at some point on the railroad?

Very respectfully,

R. E. LEE,

General.
