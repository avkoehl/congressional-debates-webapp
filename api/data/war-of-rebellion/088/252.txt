HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 17, 1864-11 p. m.

[Major-General HUMPHREYS:]

GENERAL: I did intend to send you this dispatch in the morning, which I had already written. The dispatch by Major Michler induces me to send it now. I will do all I can toward any vulnerable point. I do not believe the enemy will leave Petersburg open to assault in the daytime, unless he evacuates it entirely the night before.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

CIRCULAR, HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,

Numbers 106. August 17, 1864.

The order received last night for the corps to move at 3 o'clock this morning having been suspended, and the order of suspension being very indefinite, the major-general commanding did not feel authorized to announce it. He does so now for the information of the command, in order to let the ment get their coffee.

by command of Major-General Warren:

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CIRCULAR, HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,

Numbers 107. August 17, 1864.

The corps will move to-morrow at 4 a. m. and in the following order: Griffin's division, Ayres' division, Crawford's division, and Cutler's division. The batteries, as previously assigned to the several divisions, will move with them. The reserve artillery and one-half of the ambulances and one medicine wagon for each division will march in rear of the corps. No ordnance trains, battery, nor forage wagons will accompany the column, nor will any baggage wagons be allowed except spring wagons. The baggage and other wagons left behind will be parked in the morning to conduct it.

By command of Major-General Warren:

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General, Commanding Ninth Army Corps.
