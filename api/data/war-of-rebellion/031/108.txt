close the them soon after dark. It will be necessary to drive it away at daylight. A force of cavalry and infantry is also on our left. I shall be glad to see General Burnside, but do not wish to deprive him of rest.

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

I think the extra bridge ought to be built; that his command ought to cross, and, as soon as he and Summer are over, attack simultaneously.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,December 12, 1862.

General D. P. WOODBURY,

Commanding Volunteer Engineer Brigade:

I believe General Franklin has spoken to Major Magruder about a foot bridge or infantry bridge where his other bridges are, if there are pontoons enough. General Smith spoke to me about a foot bridge this evening, and, on referring it to General Burnside, he said he had told you to put it up at town, but now thinks it had much better be below, and wished me to tell you.

Very respectfully,

C. B. COMSTOCK,

Lieutenant of Engineers and Chief Engineer, Army of the Potomac.

General J. G. PARKE:

Yesterday the smoke entirely obstructed the view of the other side of the river. It is probably the same this morning. The movement has been ordered to take place at daylight.

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FRANKLIN'S GRAND DIVISION,December 12, 1862-9.15. [a.m.] (Received 12.45 p.m.)

General BURNSIDE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

General Franklin's grand division crossing well. Two divisions of Smith's corps already over. The third division about to cross. Bayard's cavalry will cross first, to reconnoiter, and to communicate with Sumner. A battery is now crossing. Three batteries already over. A portion of the artillery on the bluffs in position might, it is thought, be advantageously taken over. Franklin needs some.

Very respectfully,

JAS. A. HARDIE,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers and Assistant Inspector-General.
