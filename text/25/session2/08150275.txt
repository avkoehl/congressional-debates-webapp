£5th Cong--"2nd Sess.    ________________Cumberland Road—Mr. Campbell.                                                         H. of Reps.
ment, and retrenchment in the public expenditure?
The present Administration stands pledged by ths
avowals of the Executive to carry out those princi-
ples, and I, for one, Mr Chairman, am not dis-
posed to shrink from the performance or fulfilment
of the pledges of the Administration to the people
But, sir, this bill meditates the very reverse of all
our pledges. It is intended and designed for politi-
cal effect it has been conceived in a settled deter-
mination to get up a wasteful expenditure of the
public funds, for the purpose of enabling the oppo-
nents of the Administration to raise the watchword
af alarm, preparatory to a deafening outcry of pro-
fusion and prodigality against this Admimstiation.
I am not to be led astray by any such artifice no
gulltrap of the kind can catch me, and I appeal to
any man oí this Administration, to any man of the
" bread and soup party," as we are called, to come
forward and defeat the project of the opponents of
he Administration.
Sir, I am a friend and supporter of this bread and
soup party, as it has been scornfully denominated,
and I am proud of the cause in which I am en-
gaged, for it is the cause of the people, of civil
liberty, and of law. I am, sir, a radical m all
thing*, and particularly a radical in my support of
the Administration. I am a foe of those who
would waste the public treasure, I am a foe to all
splendid schemes of Government, I go foi an eco-
nomical administration of the affairs of the coun-
try, and am determinedly hostile to high tariffs,
quixotic expeditions to the South Seas, and hold m
abhorrence all projects which have not the happi-
ness and the interests of the people m view, nor
am I to be found among those who would pamper
the pride and luxurious fancy of public officers, by
erecting stately edifices and palaces for them to
luxuriate in at the expense of the people
If this bill is to pass, I wish to know who is re-
sponsible for it, the Administration or its oppo-
nents; ana if one hundred and fifty thousand dol-
lars are to be wasted in destroying one building to
erect another, I am anxious that my people should
know who the act is to be accomplished by. Will
the friends of the Administration, with retrench-
ment and economy on their lips, consent to an act
so opposite to the sincerity of their professions'
Who, sir, will support this bill? The partisans
of Mr Van Buren and the former advocates of
General Jackson? It may be, sir, that it will find
the support of a few of all sides, and I shall not be
surprised if gentlemen of weak nerves and timid
hearts, professing to be the champions of the Ad-
ministration, are found giving it their votes
Sir, it is ever the misfortune of overgrown and
successful parties to find m its ranks men who, in
the hour of adversity, 01 in the hour when a little
extraordinary thunder is supposed to be discerni-
ble m the political atmosphere, shrink from their
professed fealty and political attachment, and are
surely to fly for safety to the camp of the enemy
Sir, it has been the misfortune of the Administra-
tion party to have many men of this description
among its numbers Our opponents gathered in its
folds old Federalists, the champions ot the Hartford
convention, counterfeit Democrats, National Re-
publicans, Antimasons, and Abolitionists They
have, sir, been a kind of catch-all, or ornnium
gatherum, and it is from such base material, that we
find skulking and dodging, when it is supposed that
a cloud of danger is gathering Thank God,
the recent elections in the Noith and the East
have nearly cleared our ranks of such materials,
and I thank God for it Let them go We wish
none of their aid—none of their assistance In
fact, sir, they were an incubus to the party, and
will ever be an incubus to the party to which they
may attach themselves
There may be others, sir, professed friends of the
Administration, who have, of late, been frightened
to their wits ends, by the gasconade and bravado
of the Whigs, who may vote for the passage of this
bill. They have, of late, been told that Whiggery,
as it is called, is about to take possession of the
whole world. The Whigs say they have carried
Maine by a majority of I know not how many
thousands, Connecticut by five or six thousand,
New Yoik by thousands, and even Baltimore,where
the election for a successor of the late Mr. McKim
has not yet taken place, they loudly affirm has
already been carried by a majority of computing
thousands They will, probably, vote for this ex-
travagant bill WelL, sir, let them do it, and let them
also quit our party if they choose Our party has, at
all times, and on all occasions, suffered much from
men of this description In us early history, it had
its Judases—men professing our principles and ad-
vocating our cause, the moment they saw, or
thought they saw, a little danger in the distance,
[here Mr Yell turned round and pointed to a gentleman
who sal near by htm,] deserted the camp, fled to the
enemy, and left us—I hope forever We wish
no such men in out ranks, and I rejoice that they
have taken up their quaiters with our common
enemy
This bill, Mr Chairman, if sustained at all, or
if passed, must be sustained and passed by other
men than those who support this Administration
It must be sustained and carried by men who are
determined to get this Administration ashore, and
then ask us to get it afloat by a flood of worthless
bank notes and shin-plasters.
[Here Mr Yell and Mr Wist held an indirect-
ly good-natured conversation, in an under tone,
about banks and shin plasters, the precise nature
of which was not understood by tne Reporter ]
As for this new Treasury building, Mr Chair-
man, what are the objections raised against it, ¡hat
call for its demolition'' Why, sir, it is said that
it stands in the way of the President's mansion1 It
is guilty of the monstrous crime of hiding the Wmte
House from the view of some gentlemen who hold
seats m the other end of the Capitol It impedes
their vision, and, forsooth, the} cannot iee that
building, for the occupancy of which their hearts
palpitate, and all their aspirations are breathed bj
midday, and o  whien their dreams are ba^d at
the midnight hour [Loud lai shtcr r id i"proba-
tion ] Sir, the) cannot «ee the Exeeu * e man^ on
Indeed, they cannot behold *hat ed fie from mat
end of the Capitol, and lei me tell j cu, sir, that if
they wre to change their seats and come to i'ns
end of the Capitol, they would s'i'1 find themselves
suffering under total obscuration of vision The
Executive mansion would not then greet their anx
ious etes, and let me add, they never can behold
it, for the people have already decided that they
never shall occupy that ed fice, for they are not
worthy [Here the House indulged m a bird fit
of laughter, all sides partaking of the general
humor ]
As for the new Treasury building, Mr Chair-
man, it is, in my opinion, good enough for all the
purposes for which it was intended, although I have
nev er examined it, or taken anj pains topiocure
any information that would entble me to decide
on its merits If I we^e to exanme it, I should
know nothing about it, for I know but httte or no-
thing about the laws and rules of architecture It,
however, I should take the trouble to go nto an
analysis of its excellencies or delects, I should be
just as wise in relation to it as the Comrmttee on
Public Buildings are, for they tell you that they
know nothing, of themselvts, about the matter, and
have furnished a report 10 this House on informa-
tion obtained from others. The building is good
enough for all the purposes contemplated in its
ei ections and I protest against the waste of a large
sum of money to des'roy it.
Mr. Chairman, whilst gentleman stood read) to
waste one hundred and fitly or three hundred thou-
sand dollars, not to build up, but to de troi, s it
nota little singular, that they refuse to i ote one
farthing to suppiass Indian hostilities 01 pltce the
frontier in a state of defence The «hole of jour
frontier border is now tnieatened with a bloody
and desolating war The tomahawk has been
ground, and the S"alpmg knife is whetted, for the
bloody action, and from the Upper Lakes to the
shores of the Sabine, you hear the w ar crj of the
infuriated savage cf the forest You are called on
for money to defend the lives and property of those
whom you are bound to protect, and what is j our
reply The Treasury w exhausted, the prospects
of the country are gloomy, you must wait a little
longer,assistance cannot now be given1 Sir, wait
a little longer'! and how long must we waif Till
your boidei is deluged m blood, your lands devasta-
ted, andyour offspring are given to the faggot and the
knife, and all this must be waited for, Because po-
liticians at the other end of the Capitol want to see
the Executive mansion
Mr. Chairman, I represent a people, who are
as intelligent as they are patriotic, and as econo-
mical as they are brave and hardy They demand
a free participation in the affairs of this Union, and
they stand ready to denounce prodigality and ex-
travagance, wherever it be found. They never
can be much capable of justifying the gross
and un pardonable wast and abuse, which
this bill, if passed, must carry in its tram, and
in the name of the American people, I protest
against its passage, and in doing so, I appeal to the
friends of this Administration in Congress, to «eto
a measure at once, which, if submitted to by them,
will at once justify the abuse that has been heaped
upon them by their foes, and seal without reflec-
tion or objection, the charge of profusion and pro-
digality, which has been for months rung in their
ears by their foes
Having said much more ih?n I originally de-
signed to say, and having trespassed on the pa-
tience and mdu'gence of the committee, I Yield
the floor, agam and again most unequivocally pro-
testing aqainst the passage of t,ie bill
CUMBERLAND ROAD.
REMARKS OF MR.CAMPBELL,
Of South Carolina,
ft the House of Representares, Jjpnl   11, 1838 —
The motion of Mr Underwood to recommit the
"bill matn'ig appropriations for continuing the
Cumoerland road in the States of Ohio, Indiana>
«id Il'iiiois and for other purposes," to the Com-
ía  iee  of Wivs fia  Meáis, w th mstiucUons
lo report a bill ceding the   road to  the  States
throueh which it p- s,es, bdrg under considera -
t on, and Mr Undfkwood having addf^ed the
Hou-e m supno«- of it—
Mr   CAMPBELL remarked that, w th the opi-
nions, he entertained, he would be wanting in hts
duty if he did not raise his voice m opposition to
the bill now under consideration, and in support of
the motion just made by the honorable gentleman
from Kentucky, [Mr Úvderwood ]    He congra-
tulated the House and the eoustry «pon the mo-
tion, coming frtm the quarter it did, as indicative
of a better leelmg upon the subject of public ex-
penditure, and hoped, if successtul, that an eternal
separation would take place between the Govern-
ment and this favorite object of internal improve-
ment
He would ask gentlemen w hether the Cumber-
lard road is more immediately connected wiih the
military defence or foieign commerce of the coun-
try than a thousand others that intersect it m every
direction, or whether the appropriations contained
in the bill under consideration are not hable to the
general objections applicable to appropriations for
other objects of internal improvement's
He knew that this road had a sort of prescrip-
ts e right to the patronage of the General Govern-
ment that as far back as 1806 an appropriation
was made for its construction out of the two per
cent fund, reserved from the sale of public lands,
for laying out and making roads to the State ot
Ohio, under the ' act of 1802, authorizing the peo-
p'e in the eastern division of the territory on the
northwest of the Ohio m er, to form a constitution
and State Government " Whether it was then
supposed that this would become, w hat it has long
since been, a charge upon the oublie Treasury, it
is not material to inquire We know that appro-
priation* for us construction commenced m 1806,
under the administration of Mr Jefferson, and have
continued to the present t me
If this was a Government whose constitutional
powers were settled by precedents, the frequent ap-
propriations for tins road, extending through a pe-
riod of more than thirty years, would be sufficient
to establish the constitutionality of this bill While,
however, he protested against such a construction,
he would waive its discussion, and base his oppo-
sition upon gronnds of expediency
He did not intend to condemn the pulicv   unite*
