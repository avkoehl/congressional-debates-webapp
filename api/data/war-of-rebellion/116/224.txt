GENERAL: The Honorable Hamilton Fish and Rev. Bishop Ames have been appointed by the War Department to proceed to Richmond and other points where prisoners of the United States may be confined in the South for the purpose of ministering as far as may be in their power to their comfort. The Quartermaster-General and Surgeon-General will be directed to send clothing and medical supplies to your care at Fort Monroe and the Secretary desires you to forward them at such times and to such places as the commissioners may indicate to you. There may be other articles also not usually furnished, such as combs, brushes, &amp;c., necessary for the health and comfort of the prisoners which you will cause to be procured and forwarded on the requisition of the commissioners.

I am, sir, &c.,

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, Va., January 30, 1862.

Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.

SIR: Herewith I transmit for your consideration a letter* from J. P. Benjamin, Secretary of War of the rebel Government, to Samuel L. M. Barlow, Merchants' Exchange, New York.

Mr. Barlow has been represented to me as a full-blooded secessionist. This may not be true from the fact that he has been treated as I am informed with great consideration by officers holding high positions at Washington. It is too, true, however, that we have many in and out of the Army who strongly sympathize with the rebellions South and who are treated with too much consideration by men in subordinate as well as high positions.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, Va., January 30, 1862.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS, Adjutant-General.

SIR: Herewith I transmit a letter of this date from Major-General Huger asking the release of Assistant Surgeon Connolly, New York
