Lieutenant General J. LONGSTREET, Greeneville, Tenn.:

The Department cannot determine the propriety of your movements; that rests in your discretion. It is advisable, however, that the court-martial in General McLaws' case assemble as soon as it can properly do so. Report your determination, and communicate it, also, to the president of the court.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

GREENEVILLE, February 29, 1864.

Brigadier General B. R. JOHNSON, Commanding Division:

The lieutenant-general commanding still thinks you had better move your force back. If the cavalry you have is not sufficient to hold the gaps you can have a regiment of infantry in each till better cavalry arrangements can be made.

The only attack apprehended at either position is possibly one of cavalry. Should your judgment concur in this you can move without further orders. Such regiments as re-enlist in whole and whose time of service is actually about to expire will be granted 5 percent. of furloughs on re-enlistment in addition to the General Orders, 13. This not to include regiments originally enlisted for "three years or the war."

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

OSMAN LATROBE,

Major, Assistant-General.
