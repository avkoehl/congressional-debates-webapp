CHAPEL HILL, March 14, 1863-2.30 a.m.

General POLK,

Shelbyville, Tenn.:

GENERAL: Nothing additional since my last from the enemy in my front. A scout leaving their vicinity at 9 o'clock had failed to discover any move or change after dark, up to that time.

General Wharton's dispatch containing orders read.

Very respectfully,

P. D. RODDEY,

Colonel.

NEAR WIDOW BROWN'S HOUSE,

March 14, 1863-11 a.m.

General POLK,

Shelbyville, Tenn.:

GENERAL: We are at this point, 1 mile from Rover, waiting signal. There has been a few guns fired near Eagleville toward a scouting party of ours. A scout from Holt's Corners reports twenty to thirty guns fired west of that point; don't know anything of the cause, as I have no scout in that direction.

Very respectfully,

P. D. RODDEY,

Colonel.

UNIONVILLE-1 p.m.

Lieutenant General LEONIDAS POLK:

GENERAL: The enemy have not yet advanced; I am expecting them. Please keep the prisoner sent by Colonel Hagan, who claims to be Rosecrans' orderly, until Colonel Malone arrives, which will be to-night or early in the morning. If Davis comes, we will give them the best fight there is in us. I am satisfied if the courier's things, saddle, &amp;c., were thoroughly examined, dispatches would be found. I am entirely out of paper and envelopes. The enemy are now at Eagleville.

Respectfully, general,

JNO. A. WHARTON.

Very respectfully,

P. D. RODDEY,

Colonel.
