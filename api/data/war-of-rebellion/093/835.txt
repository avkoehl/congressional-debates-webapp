JONESBOROUGH, December 13, 1864.

Part of my command and artillery is up; will take until dark to get all the train up. From what General Duke dispatches me I fear the enemy will be in my rear at Zollicoffer or Bristol to-night. What do you advise?

(Via Jonesborough.)

Colonel Morgan's pickets were driven in yesterday at Rogersville. I thinks it relegable that the enemy is advancing force up the north side of the Holston. Colonel Morgan is falling back in direction of Kingsport. I shall move back as rapidly as possible, but the enemy can make Bristol before my trains my can if he continues advance.

Prisoner captured yesterday at Cobb's Ford reports he left Knoxville Saturday morning with Gillem's force, which formed a junction with Burbridge Sunday night at Bean's Station. Gillem moved yesterday morning in the direction of Rogersville; Burbridge would followed; all for Abingdon.

Major J. S. JOHNSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Telegraph Vaughn and Duke to fight and delay the enemy at all possible points. Send order for Witcher to move toward Saltville; to General Echols to collect the reserve at once; and to Giltner to hold his troops in hand and unite with Vaught and Duke if they are forced back. If enemy continues to advance we must have transportation here to-move for artillery, &amp;c.

NEAR MOUNT AIRY, December 22, 1864.

GENERAL: My command is at present between here and Wytheville, but on account of the intense cold yesterday evening and to-day had to halt, as it is an impossibility to move the men. As soon as it moderates I will join you. Regret very much that I have not been able to join you before this. The last heard from our wagon train, including the pressed Virginia teams, they were safe near the North Carolina line. I send a courier to order them back to Grayson Court-House. If you think it
