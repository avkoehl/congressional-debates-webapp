Maine Boundary Question—Mr. Adams.
Ho. ot Reps.
Isid down that none could misunderstand it In
thib case the question of propeity was wholly
immaterial, the question of possession was the
only only one to which we were to look As to
the property, indeed, nothing could be more
clear, the question was fully discussed in an
able lepoit made to theot'ier House byits Com
rmttee on foreign Affairs If any man wanted
light on the whole contioversy, theie it was to
be found If any man had a lingering doubt
upon his mind, let him read that document, and
be convinced, as he soon would be, that there
was nothing at all m the claim of Great Butain
The answci as to the question of boundary was
spoken by Natuie heiself Men might dispute
about what constituted a highland, and what was
a hill, and what was a mountain, but if there was
any height of ground from which the streams
run in opposite dnections, into the St Lawrence
on the one hand, and into the Atlantic on the other,
it was enough The words of the treaty were
answered The everlasting, unalteiable face of
Natuie herself, bore witness to the agreement
between the two nations as to their boundary
The claim set up by Great Bntam was a meie
fetch—a pretext to get hold of a piece of ground
which it was very desn able for her to possess
Under circumstances like these, was it possible
for this Government to go further than to admit
the ground of ■uhpomdetis'1 We had given up to
her the juusdiction on the Madawaska Must
we go fuither than this' Shall we admit that
the uncontested possession of the whole territory,
not only on the Madawaska, but on the Aroos-
took, shall suddenly be taken by an aimed force '
The question whether Governor Fairfield had
done amiss or no, m the step he had taken, was
of comparatively little consequence He had vi
olated courtesy, but had not violated his official
duty He had done nothing more than duve off
trespassers from a portion of territory of which
his State had possession Could there be any
right in a foreign Government to enter it by force
of arms, and drive him off, for that is threatened '
Sir John Harvey had written to Governor Fair-
field, giving him warning that he should enforce
the exclusive possession of Gieat Britain by the
employment of her military strength It was a
gross violation of the law of nations, and was not
to be submitted to
Mr L said that it was not in the spirit of war
he said this He admitted that we must not pie
judge the question, but this nation could not treat
with any foreign Power with a hostile foot upon
her soil Her first language to that nation must
be—"Go back1 withdraw youi foot' and then
we will send an embassador "
Mr L said that nothing could be more depre-
cated by his constituents than a wai with Great
Britain, yet, when it was necessary tothehonorof
their country, none would be moie ready in doing
their whole duty That necessity was the only
question They scorned the spuit of bravado,
but, in their name, he should vote for this bill,
if it were only to satisfy the British Government
how deeply this country was inteiested in this
question of jurisdiction, and asa means of giving
greater solemnity to the negotiation in regard to
it He deprecated a resort to arms I o enter
into a war for its own sake, was now too late for
the spirit of the age Within the lastthnty years
they had all seen contested questions of the most
serious natuie and the most thieatenmg aspect
dissipated into thin an, when the armies of both
parties were raised, embodied, drawn out, and
on the very edge of contest He hailpd it as one
of the happy auguries of the future age of the
■world, that the united influence of commerce and
Christianity had so often triumphed over the
spirit of war, and even bade fair to banish it
among men
Under the influence of these feelings, Mr L
■would adjuie gentlemen on all sides of tin. House
not to go into those exciting topics which con-
nected themselves with this subject, and which
■were so well calculated to stir up embittered feel-
ing, and thus render incurable the breach between
two great nations, whose kindred, origin, Ian
guage, laws, and commerce ought to link them
togethei in bonds of indissoluble amity and
friendship
MAINE BOUND \RY QUESTION
SPEECH OP HON. J  Q. ADAMS,
OP MASSACHUSETTS,
In the House op Representatives,
March 2, 1S39,
On the bill giving the President additional power for the
defense of the United State , &c
Mi   ADAMS siid
Mr Chairmím I had entertained the hope that
I should not have felt myself called upon to say one
word more upon the subject now before the com-
mittee I had hoped (and I still chensh the hope)
that the immediate occasion for the passage of
this bill, foi the action of this House upon the
matters to which it has reference, had passed
away That immediate occasion was of the most
alaimmg, I may say of the most teinfic charae-
tei It was no less than a direct menace from a
commanding officer of the British Government,
in a province adjoining one of our own States, of
an immediate invasion of the United States by
him, under the express and positive orders of
his Government Sir, the thought of war, even
with the weakest nation, is a dreadful thought,
but when contemplated with one of the most pow-
erful nations on the face of the earth, I have no
language to express the feeling with which the
thought comes upon me, that such an event is
impending ovei my country And yet that was
the attitude in which the subject was first pie-
sented to this House Connected with this great
and tcrnble idea of war, the first question which
every patriot has to settle with himself is, with
whom is the ug/ii, and, after that, be is called
upon to meet every calamity of which human na-
tuie is susceptible, even to the loss of his own
fortune and life—of the inteiest and the welfare
of his family—of everything, in short, that is dear
to man He must meet it with an unflinching
eye And this was oui position not more than
four days ago I say I cherish the hope that that
hour has passed away for the present, that, in
consequence of the agieement made between the
minister of her Britannic Majesty and the Secie-
tary of State here, an actual suspension of hos-
tilities will be earned into effect And that is all
which is required to prevent that immediate col
hsion to which we had looked A suspension of
hostilities, that is all we can now expect, for, sir,
the offieeis of the British Government, military
and diplomatic, are directly at issue with uj> on
the very point upon which those hostilities were
to commence, and are to commence, if at all
They are at issue, and that issue was first stated
by the Goveinor of New Bunswick—was con-
fumed by hei Butannic Majesty's Minister here
—and was dnectly taken by the Secretary of State
of the United States Now if that issue weie to
be brought to the conflict of arms which three or
four days ago seemed so immediately probable, I
presume we should not have had the discussion
which has already taken place on this bill I pre-
sume there would have been some appearance of
unanimity in the opinions of this House, as to
what was to be done to defend the country from
hostile assaults But, sir, the aspect of the pub
Uc question between us and Gieat Britain has
changed since then—changed in consequence of
the agieement made heie—an agreement which,
if there is time for it to roach the territory of the
British Province before actual collision takes
place, will, I presume, prevent collision until such
time as the Butish Government shall be heard
fiom
Now, there is, behind this probability, a pros-
pect of collision which we have just had—an old
long standing controversy m relation to territorial
boundai y The question now is what will be the
aspect of that controversy when the British Gov
ernment shall have been informed of what has
taken place heie' I suppose I cannot possibly
doubt that the British Government will recede
fiom the ground that has been taken by then offi-
cers, military and diplomatic, and that that Gov-
ernment will not pretend to rest their determina-
tion to appeal to the God of battles for a decision
of this controversy on the pretension of an agree
ment between them and the Government oí the
United States, that they should have that exclusive
jurisdiction which is finally to mure to the party
to which the terntoi y shall be allotted They v. ill
not do so, because they cannot produce any au-
thoiity of such an argument I tiust, therefoie,
that they will lecede Piobably they may make
an aigument which has been made for them in
this House—certainly they will not make it with
moie ability—that, although there was not an
explicit agreement, as stated by the Butish Min-
ístei heie, still there was an understanding, an
acquiescence on our pait, in their assertion of that
exclusive juusdiction which they have constantly
maintained I say that, if they meet us with such
an aigument as that, it will be impossible for
them, I defy them, to present an abler argument
than has been made on this floor If they should
make that argument, and adhere to it—if they
should put the assertion of a determination to
maintain jurisdiction by force of arms upon that
argument—and most especially, if they put it on
the ground that, by a forcible expression of in-
dignation on the part of the Legislature of your
and my native Commonwealth, Mr Chairman,
the failure to sustain, with proper spirit, the right
of our own country, had been denominated a sur-
render of this question—if, I say, the British Gov-
ernment shall convert that single expression of
indignation into an argument to prove that this
right had been surrendered, as has been argued
here, then, we should be under the necessity of
meeting them by another argument, to show that
the foundation of their appeal to arms would, in
that case, be as false as that which their officers
have now taken in their behalf
I believe that the British officer v. ho has taken
this ground has done so under a misapprehen-
sion, but how far that misapprehension extends,
it must be left to future time to discover It is
quite possible (I do not say probable, though per-
haps I might do so) that the instructions of this
British officer have been drawn out in such lan-
guage that he will be fully justified in the con-
struction he has put upon them, and that they
were so drawn out for the purpose of experiment
An experiment upon what' Upon the under-
standings of the members of this House, an ex-
peument upon the spirit of the people of this
countiy, an experiment whether we will endure,
on any ground whatever, the assertion of a de
termination to settle, by force, the question which
we haie been so long and so unsuccessfully en-
deavoring to settle by negotiation I repeat the
expression of my belief that the British Govern-
ment will disavow the construction given to his
ordeis by the Governor of New Brunswick, but
I do not undertake to say that they will not pre-
tend that there has been an agreement on out
pait that exclusive jurisdiction of this territory,
in the interval, until the settlement, should be
held by them It is quite possible that they may
do so, and I confess that -«.hat I heard yestei-
day on this floor was so plausible, so ably urged,
that I should not be surptised if the British Gov-
ernment should take a leaf fiom the reports of
our debate of yesterday, and cast it in our teeth,
as their argument for giving a new order to then
Governor to take possession of the territory, not
upon the pretension which he has now set up,
, but upon the argument which has been made m
their favor upon this floor I should not be sur-
prised if this aigument which has been uiged
upon us for doing nothing, for leaving the State
of Maine to her fate, should now be taken and
held forth by the Butish Government to say
"No, we disavow the allegation of the expresa
agreement, but you ha\e endured it so long that
you have surrendeied the point,and there is your
own evidence in the act of one of your on n legis-
lators, and you shall not íesume it We will take
military possession of the country, it is too late
for you to pretend to dispute the claim, you have
surrendered it, we will keep and maintain it "
That, sir, will be anotl or experiment
Now, to this experiment on the part of the
Butish Governor of New Brunswick, the S ite
of Maine, in woidb as strong, as deal, as unequiv-
ocal, as inflexible as human language can supply,
has said that she is not prepared to submit  nj
the question is, whethei we shall now ¡siy mat
we will not submit to that expeument noi any
