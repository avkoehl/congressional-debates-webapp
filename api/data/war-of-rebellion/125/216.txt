that a large number have been thus enlisted for New Jersey, the agents paying from $350 to $375. Massachusetts, I am informed, has done the same, paying $400 cash down. All this is done under a recent general order by which men re-enlisting can be credited to any State they see fit. This is all wrong, and should be remedied at once if possible. I wish you would ascertain the facts and report to me at once.

Truly, yours, &amp;c.,

HORATIO SEYMOUR.

It may be that so such order as the one herein referred to exists.

Washington, D. C., April 5, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: In reply to a resolution of the Senate dated March 22, 1864, relative to the number, &c., of nine-months" troops called out under the act of July 17, 1862, and which was referred to this office, I have the honor to report as follows:

First. Number of troops raised or received into service under said act:

Nine-months" volunteers............................... 18,884

Nine-months" militia.................................. 65,305

------

Total................................................. 84, 189

Second. The bounty of $25 has been paid to all the volunteers (18,884) accepted under said act. This number was called out by the Governor of Pennsylvania without any call being made by the President for such volunteers.

No call under that section was made upon any State, but the men having been raised, as stated, in Pennsylvania, and the bounty provided by that section promised them by the Governor of that State, the President under these circumstances, determined to accept them into the service as nine-months" volunteers.
