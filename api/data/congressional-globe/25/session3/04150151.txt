Expenditures of the Government—-Mr. Murray.
Ho. of Reps.
¡ence and asperity Whilst harassed by the mis-
siles of the internal improvement interest, he was
suddenly called on to arrest the rapid and danger-
ous ma>xh of another branch of this incomparable
system, the Bank of the United States. And here,
again, he had to throw himself into the breach,
amid the fierce onset of the bank's attack, and
cry aloud to his slumbering countrymen, who
awoke, and rallied to the standard of their daunt-
less and incorruptible chief. There could be no
division of streng h while engaged in this, contest.
The enemy had, unobserved by the people, grown
etiong in his power, and insolenr in his vanity,
setting "both God and man at defiance." The
stiuggie was long and doubtful, the monster show-
ing himself a match for the fame of the hero, the
energy and firmness of the President, and the
patriotism of the people. This leading member,
however, of the hydra family was at length sub-
dued; but he showed himself terrible in the very
agonies of death, dealing thick and fast around
him the most deadly blows. Even the diead
iashingí of his tremendous tail — of panics and
cuspens-ions— produced soreness and revulsions
in out circulation and commerce, afllictmg alike
¡.o both Government and people.
While the President was engaged with these
relatives of the Titan family, there arrived at full
age and growth another tall son of the same pater-
nity, who began to render himself conspicuous as
a fomentei of" discontent, and a distuiber of the
pqual rightsof the various interests of the Union.
His favoute haunts were in the East, upon which
he was concentiating the showers of prosperity,
whnh had before, with undistinbed evenness,
fallen upon all the nation alike. lie was a great
P«(tiot in his piofessions, and called hinisell the
' patron and protector of our domestic manufac-
tjies " In this he was no doubt suiceie, but in
i h devotion to this inteiest,he foigotthat he was
sacrificing equal or more impoi taut interests, es-
fecially agncultuie and cummtice, and that he
-/as arraying the seveial sections of the Union
i gainst each other, in such manner as to portend
tne most alarming disasters. It was soon discov-
ered that no interest could long prosper, unless its
-orrelative interests prospered, also, at the same
.ime Like the fabled war between the different
membeis of the human body, by which each was
i aught that it was dependent upon the healthful
*nd harmonious cooperation of all the others, the
opeiation of this policy soon proved that it was
"utile and destructive to disuinunate between the
vanout, interests of the body-politic, with the view
of encoutaging some, when it would opei«te to the
expense nt others Tiue to his natural and un-
avoidable tendencies, however, this evil destroyer
of the peace and prosperity of our people, hastened
on to a cuas, the dangerous times of his power
wid influence. Nor do I believe him to have been
less inimical to the innocence of the people and
peipetuity of oui Government; for the surplus
revenue, ins legitimate offspring, might, in acourbe
ol legislation, have undei mined the one and ulti-
mately tetuunated the other. But amid lemon-
sirances the mo3t importunate, and appeals the
most fervent against thefurther conitnuanee of his
reign, which were as little heeded as attended to
by his votaries, he alighted down in the South,
accompanied with ms attendant evils, to desolate
he fieids, and blight her piospeuty. tlere his
destined fate awaited him. It was here he caught
a taitat that unhinged all his prospects, and over-
threw his ambitious schemes. Like King John
of England, when Magna Cnarta was wrested from
him at Runnyrnede, this king taiiff saw at once
that his power must be suirendered, and that he
must make the best terms he could with those
whose substance he was robbing, and whose se-
curity he was endangering. He yielded to his
fate, and consented to be shorn of his strength, for
the boon of a sickly existence till 1842, when it is
calculated by the sense of the good people of these
United States thai he will be permitted to expire
in peace, without hens hung at the time, and with-
out a ¡successor
Sir, (mid Mr, M.,) I am no fnend to nullifica-
tion, yet, in tins u stance, I íejoice, yes, heartily
lejoee, at the legitimate consequences of South
Caí olma resistance. Neveitheless, I hold that this
remedy, in such a case, may not be used. It is,
in my opinion, both dangerous and unlawful; and
although, as in this case, good may result from it,
yet the most destructive evils might also be its
consequence. And although 1 rejoice at the fall
of the tariff", yet, in the graduation of a system of
duties for purposes of revenue merely, I should
not be averse to a sound discrimination, so as to
give to a reasonable extent incidental protection,
I I subjoin the following graphic sketch of the
rise, tendencies, and fall of the tariff, from the re-
port of the Committee of Ways and Means.
'•Prior to the late war witli Great Britain, our tariffs
were revised, and our taxes levied, to supply the wants of
Government, however thev mieht operate incidentally on
the in ernal mdustrv of the country. It was never then
designed to raise more reverue than was actually necessary
to supply our Federal wants. During the war, large in-
vestments were made bj our capitalist;, and manufacturer ;
and when it was over, Ihe principle of our revenue law*;
was entirely reversed. Our taxes weie no longer graduated
by the wants of the Government, but by the demands of
our capitalists lor protection, tims substituting the incident
for Ihe principal Our tanh\ were devised without any
regard to the condition of our finances, and a broad founda-
I tion wa= laid for a redundant revenue. The consequence
was a lapid ettingut liment of the public debt, funded and
unfunded of one huulrsd and fi'ty millions o£ dollars.
Anticipating this redemption, appropriations m every
branch oí the public sf rvice were increased; and still more
extensively, to absorb a prospective surplus, new objects of
I expéndame were sought lor, winch had been before eon-
I sidered undei the jurisdiction of ihe States. Surveys viere
authorized, laying the foundalion for a Federal system of
roads, canals, harbors, and other improvements, sulheicnt
to ixhaust any surplus which might possibly occur. Ilx-
uavagance was dernied patriotic, as designed lo perpetuate
protection to m inulacmres The one was indispensable
to iheothei;nnd lor a time the rights of the tax piyerwere
wholly disregarded " * * * " Notwithstanding these
expe nditun s, tor< ign as they are to the te 'inmate dunes of
a con!  delated Govt riimciit, the extravagant tendency of a
surplus, and the rapid redemption ol our public debt, we
htvt txen already compelled to deposit tight and twenty
millions ot doll ns with Un' tíutes Fortunan ly, however,
thisasMH'iatioii ol piotce nop, surplus, and f xtravagai ce, is

Mr  M   would now proceed to a statistical ex-
I animation of the Government expenditures.   He
' had   wandered  long  enough, perhaps too long,
though he did not think the digression would be
uninteresting to his constituents.    And first (said
i Mr. M.J I will submit a table of the annual ex-
I penditures, showing the amount expended es.ch
year, for thirteen years next preceding 1838.
Table shou mg the amounts expended each year, exclusive
of the puhht d, ht and the Post Office, from the year 1825 to

in glancing the eye over this tabular statement,
I it will be seen that the two mostappropnate years
to be contrasted with eath other, in ordtr to ac-
count for the sudd en increase of the annual expend-
ltuies, are the yeats 1835 and 1836.    The sudden
rise of the expenditures from ¡>17,ü00,OOQ, in 1835,
, to 5,30,000 000, in   1836, naturally brings up the
inq ury, foi what did this increase take place, and
[ are its grounds justifiable.

And the remaining excess over 1835 is only........§31,009
In looking over these items of excess over pay-
ments on the same accounts in 1835, it will be
seen that most of them are either nominal, being,
in fact, no expenditure at all, or such as cannot
attach any responsibility to the Administration.
Thus, the Chickasaw fund and patent fund are
meiely nominal. The item of $904,000 for three
and five per cent, fund paid to new ótales is un-
usually large this year, because a greater-quantity
of ¡and was sold in 1836 than any other year, and
the amount being dependent on the amount re-
ceived for lands, the Administration is not charge-
i able  therewith.    For the  increase m pensiona,
J revolutionary claims, and Virginia claims, the
Administration is not more blamable than for
paying a debt. The excess in the Indian depart-
ment, is an investment and notan expenditure,
being given for lands which will more than repay
double the amount of cost.    The large excess for
¡ repressing Indian hostilities, volunteers, and mili-
tia, arming militia, ordnance stores, &c, forage,
subsistence, &c, of the Army, fort'fications, ac-
couterments, &c, being the results of the Flonda
and Creek wars, is rather attubutable to the mis-
1 fortunes of the nation than to the fault of the Ad-
| ministration. The burning of the biuldmgs for
the Treasury and Post Office Departments, occa-
1 sions the excess for public buildings.
1 It is the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury
to submit to Congress, at the commencement of
each session, a detailed estimate of the amount
of appropriations which will be required for the
public service during the current year. Should
large appropriations be made beyond the amount
íecommended in the estimates, Congress assumes
this responsibility, and the Administration ought
not to be held accountable for the excess beyond
the estimate.

If, aftpr recommending a reasonable amount of
money for the public seivice, a much gieater or
double the amount shall be appropriated, the Ex-
ecutive must see to its application, as dnected by
law; but, in such case, the responsibility mut.1
rest upon Congress.
A full calculation of the expenditures for 1838

ments not having yet made repoit of the respect-
