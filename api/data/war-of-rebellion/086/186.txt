HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI, Springfield, Mo., October 22, 1864.

Colonel J. V. DU BOIS,Chief of Staff, Saint Louis:

A large force of the Enrolled Missouri Militia are now in active service in this district. They may be needed thirty days longer. A majority are destitute of blankets and necessary clothing. I am compelled to use them. Their officers are unwilling for them to do duty unless they are clothed to distinguish them from the enemy. White communication with department headquarters was closed I took the responsibility to issue overcoats to distinguish them and as a substitute for blankets. General Holland and Colonel Phelps assure me that a majority are barefooted and cannot purchase without distressing their families. Pleas authorize me to issue such articles of clothing as may be actually necessary for the health of these troops. Pleas answer immediately.

J. D. BRUTSCHE,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
