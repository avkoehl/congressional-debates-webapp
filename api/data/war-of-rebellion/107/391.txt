General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN,

Cincinnati, Ohio:

According to capacity of rail, our forces are gathering at Hagerstown in front of strong force at Harper's Ferry, the only one threatening Cumberland, and sustaining troops of Grafton will cut their line of communication west beyond Clear Spring, and send aid, which will probably have to march. No State troops to be relied upon. U. S. forces not accountered. General Patterson will do all possible, but cannot risk defeat near Harper's Ferry.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
