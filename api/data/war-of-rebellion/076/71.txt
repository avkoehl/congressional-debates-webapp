I sleep to-night on the Sandtown road between the forks of the Howell's Ferry road and the old Alabama road, just in advance of where I was last night. I will try and see you in the morning.

General ROUSSEAU,

Nashville and Decatur:

That cavalry expedition must now be off, and must proceed with the utmost energy and confidence. Everything here is favorable, and I have official information that General A. J. Smith is out from Memphis with force enough to give Forrest full occupation. Expeditions inland are also out from Vicksburg and Baton Rouge, as well as against Mobile. If managed with secrecy and rapidity the expedition cannot fail of success and will accomplish much good.
