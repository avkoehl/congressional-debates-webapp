Draper. May be he wants to go in the same direction. Negroes of both sexes keep constantly coming in; they are crowding our camps. Think they ought not to be brought in so close contact with soldiers. Prostitution is worse than slavery.

Captain ALBERT BROCKMAN,

Macon, Mo.:

Did you telegraph Lieutenant-Colonel Draper of the outrage at Allen? The negroes crowding into Macon must go to work on the farms where their labor is so much needed. We cannot permit them to remain in idleness and crime. We must not return them to masters nor encourage them to leave their homes, but we must insist upon industry, sobriety, and virtue; let them understand that work they must.

Captain E. J. CRANDALL,

Brookfield, Mo.:

I desire to put a good company of militia on duty in your county. Will you please designate the best company for exterminating the thieves, guerrillas, and bushwhackers, under a thoroughly reliable, temperate, honest officer? I want them for 100 days.

Brigadier-General.

Colonel GEORGE S. PARK,

Parkeville, Mo.:

DEAR SIR: Your valued communication of the 24th instant is received. Captain Wilson with his entire company has been ordered on duty at Parkeville, and I hope he will succeed in maintaining order and exterminating the thieving gang who threaten your peace. I was desirous that the captain should go on duty many days ago, but he was of the opinion that it was not necessary. I assure you, colonel, that everything in my power to do shall be done to put down the lawlessness threatened. I hope soon to get all the loyal militia of your county organized, when we can gradually relieve all other that may be on duty. I do not think there is any general uprising of rebels in Missouri, unless a large armed force should penetrate the State from the south. In such an event we shall have much trouble. Let us "watch, and fight, and pray."

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
