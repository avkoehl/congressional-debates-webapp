of $30,478,57!! 44.
The chief of orduance, in his report dated
October23, I860, (see same volume, page 653,)
states that the amount received since June
30, 1805, by his bureau, principally from the
sale of arms, was $1,079,037 73.
The Quartermaster General in his report,
dated September 30, 1867, (see page 524 of
volume containing the report of the Secretary
of War,) stated the amount received from
sales of property for the year ending June 30,
1807, at $3,442,013 28.
On page 529 of his report he says :
"In tliis connection it may be proper to state that
;,hc sales of public animals since the close of active
hostilities in 1S65 amount to the sum of $16,216,-
716 46."
The chief of ordnance, in his report dated
October IS), 1867, page 007, shows the receipt
from sale of arms, &c.. since June 30, 1806,
$432,200 23.
The Quartermaster General, in his report
dated October 20, 1808, (see volume contain-
ing report of Secretary of War to third session
Fortieth Congress, page 807,) says :
" Amount deposited to credit of appropriationson
account of sales and requisitions canceled during
the fiscal year 1868, $5,841,270 61."
On page 817 he says:
"During the past year the sales of surplus and
damaged clothing and equipage have produced the i
sum of 83,934.631 05. which lyis been deposited in the
Treasury to the credit of the appropriations.'' :
And he proceeds to show that gratuitous j
issues of clothing had been made to all the in- ;
mates of all the regularly constituted Soldiers' |
Homes, &e. 1
The chief of ordnance, in his report dated j
October 19,1868, (seesame volume, page 990,) j
shows that $2,330,707 26 had been received j
from sales of arms, &c.
The Quartermaster General, in his report, j
October '20, 1869, (see volume one, Secretary |
of War's report to second session Forty-First j
Congress, page 206,) shows sales of property j
in his bureau during the fiscal year ending I
June 30, 5869, of $1,071,213 96.
The chief of orduance, in his report of Octo-
ber 19, 1869, (see same volume, page 439,)
reports receipts from sale of arms, &c., of
31,372,967 66.
The Quartermaster General, in his report,
October 11, 1871, (volume one, page 144, re-
port of Secretary of War, third session Forty-
First Congress,) shows the sales of property
during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1870,
$1,039,264 96. ,
This report shows, ou page 149, that the i
amount agreed to be paid for rolling stock and
railroad materials which had been sold by ,
the quartermaster's bureau to different^ rail- |
road companies, amounted Juno 30, 1870, to :
$9,291,111 01, of which there had been then ;
paid $4,644,588 S3, and there was still owing ;
at that date $4,640,522 G8.
On page 151 the report says :
"Pive steamers, eight schooners, sloops, and
barges owned by the Department have been em-
ployed at a cost of 6132,563 75. Two of the steamers ,
and three of the sailing vessels have been sola
during the year for >11,310.''
Rather a low price, as it strikes uie.
The chief of ordnance, in his report of Octo- !
ber25, 1871, (same volume, page 287,) reports
the sale of arms, &c., as amounting during the I
fiscal year to $2,167,202 82.
And on page 292 of the rep ort he says :
"The department has been selling for several
years the arms and other stores that aro of obsolete
patterns and otherwise unfit for issue to troops.
More than 1,340,000 stand of small-arms have been
sold since the close of the war. 350,000 of them
within the present month, at good priees. Should
the demand for arms and other munitions continue
\ as at present,, the department will be able in a short
time to dispose of the greater part of its surplus
stores. It is very desirable that this should be done,
as the stores are unsuited to our wants, and the
expanse of keeping and preserving them is very
(treat. The sales since the 1st of July, 1870, to the
present date, amount to about five million six hun-
dred thousand dollars."
The Quartermaster General, in his last re-
port, dated October 19, 1871, page 125, says the
total sales of military clothing and equipage
of this department since June 30, 1870, real-
ized the sum of $1,875,728 84.
The chief of ordnance, in his report dated
October 24, 1871, page 250, states the amount
received from sale of arms, &e., since June 30,
1870, at $9,960,895 97.
Mr. KERR. When was that?
Mr. BECK. Since July, 1870. The date
of that report from which 1 read the extract
is October 25, 1870. The big sale to Reming-
ton was made on the 13th of October, as gen-
tlemen will remember. He goes on to show :
that he is disposing of those arms as fast as he j
can, because of the European demand, not
saying directly that the arms were going to
France, but intimating it very strongly. He
knew on the day, if not at the minute when
the contract was made, that Remington was
the agent of the French Government. And
the subsequent delivery of the arms to a man
who was known at the lime of the delivery
to be an agent of the French Government ren-
ders the executive department of this Gov-
ernment particeps criminis in that whole trans-
action, just as much as if there had been no
contract made before the time of the delivery.
If the Government had not intended to take
part in that matter by the sale and delivery of
these arms, it would have said to Remington,
" We have learned since you contracted with us
for arms a fact whieh you wrongfully and
fraudulently concealed from us. You^ are
the agent of the French Government. If you
had told us the truth we would not have sold
arms to you; and now, that we have found it
out, you cannot have them ; our honor as a
nation, our obligation as a neutral, alike lor-
bid it." That was the plain duty of the Gov-
ernment, but it did not perform it.
The officers of the War Department delivered
these arms with a full knowledge of the tacts,
and in that way identified themselves in the war
in favor of the French and against Germany just
as thoroughly as though they had taken an
active part in open belligerent acts. In his
last report, dated October 24, 1871, the ehiet
of the Ordnance Bureau speaks of the matter
again, using the following language:
"During the last fiscal year there existed a great
demand in Europe for stnall-arms and other oru-
nanco stores, and this Department took adyantago
of it, and sold, at fair prices, about ten million dol-
lars' worth of small-arms and other ordnaneestores,
under authority given by Congress in July, loOo.
The demand in Europe referred to was of
course the war between France and Germany,
which the Departmenttook advantage of wrong-
fully, in violation of the solemn obligation of the
Government, as I contend. For_ the same year
the Quartermaster General realized from the
sales in his department the sum of $1,875,000.
If gentlemen will examine into the sales by
these two bureaus alone, leaving out the mil-
! lions squandered on the Frcedmen's Bureau,
; saying nothing of captured and abandoned
' property (so called) taken from the southern
1 people, omitting the reports of the Surgeon
! General, who sold all hospital property, leuv-
\ ingout all theotherbureausof theWarDepart-
ment, taking only what 1 have been able to
gather, in looking over these books, in regard
to those two bureaus, and the sales, even at
their own prices, foot up as follows ;

That foots up in those two bureaus of the War
Department alone the sum of $80,630,770 23—
if I have not stated it correctly I have furnished
the data to correct the statement; my exam-
ination, of course, was hurriedly made—of
which not one dollar of the amount received
before June 30, 1870, was ever paid into the
Treasury of the United Slates, or accounted
for in any way, except as they saw fit to pay
oft' the claims of friends in such manner as
suited them. Whatl assert is that vast sums
of money have been spent in addition to the
appropriations we have made, instead of being
paid into the Treasury to bo held subject to
future appropriations. Then the Secretary of
War says that he caunot or will not furnish
information to this House relative to what has
been done by his Department, whether under
Mr. Stanton or any other Secretary, and asks
us to make a further appropriation for that
Department. I hope we will refuse to do it
uutil he obeys the order of Congress.
1 consider it an insult to this House, and we
will not do ourselves justice if we do not re-
fuse to appropriate another dollar to carry on
that Department, until ho tells us what has
become of all the money arising from sales of
property belonging to our constituents, not
only in these two bureaus of his Department,
in regard to which I have been able to make
some examination, but in every other bureau
of that Department during the time covered
by the resolution.
I have not bad time to look up the various
reports of the Secretary of the Navy and his
bureau officers which may bear upon this sub-
ject ; for 1 did not know until last evening that
this subject would come up to-day, or that I
would have a chance to say a word. I searched
as far as I could last night, and the facts so
ascertained I have given to the House. But I
find that the Secretary of the Navy tolls us in
his last report that he has only one hundred
and seventy-nine ships of all classes, _ a very-
large proportion of them being unfit for use ;
that the fifty-two monitors, now out of com-
mission, are all valueless as ships of war, being
laid up principally at League Island, where,
being in fresh water, they will rust out more
slowly than in saltwater; thoy might as well
be sunk in the mud to make a foundation for
the grand proposed navy-yard there.
I hold in my hand Executive Document No.
280, of the second session of the Fortieth Con-
gress, being a report made upon a call from
this House as to the number ol vessels thathad
been bought and sold, and from this report it
appears thai at that time the Navy Depart-
ment had sold three hundred and sixty three
ships since the close of the war. Where has
the money received from those sales gone ? It
never was paid into the Treasury, so taigas I
am advised. 1 must, however, do Mr. Welles
the justice to &ay that in looking over one of
his reports to-day I see that he notified the
Secretary of the Treasury that he had under
his control $65,000,000, I presume received
us the proceeds of sales, or which had been
appropriated and not used, which he^ thought
should go to the surplus fund iu the lreasury.
I hope it did go there. If it did, so far well.
I am advised by gentlemen on this side that it
did go there.
There is nothing to indicate that any of the
proceeds of sales made by the War Depart-
ment ever went into the Treasury; and 1
have not been able to ascertain with certainty
whether the §65,000,000 of which Mr. Welles
speaks went there or not. My friend lroui New
