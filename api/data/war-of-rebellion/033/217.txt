watch the enemy at the same time, if close up to their front. Let me beg you, general, to attend to the matter of paying off the Ninth Wisconsin Infantry. Its claims in this belief are certainly meritorious.

Respectfully,

WM. WEER,

Colonel, Commanding Division.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPT. OF THE NORTHWEST,

By command of Major-General Pope:

R. O SELFRIDGE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, April 14, 1863.

Major-General POPE, Milwaukee, Wis.:

I regret that I cannot just now give you any more troops. There is to be a Cabinet council on the disposition of the Indians under your charge. As soon as anything is decided on, I will telegraph to you.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, April 15, 1863-12.25 p. m.

Major-General CURTIS, Saint Louis, Mo.:

The First Wisconsin Cavalry was suggested on their own, or the Governor's, request. Of course, you will exercise your discretion what to send. It is important, however, that you help General Rosecrans all you possible can. No serious demonstrations can be now made against your department. On the other hand, the enemy is massing his strength against General Rosecrans.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

SAINT LOUIS, MO.,

April 15, 1863-3.50 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

The Burdell matter will not result harshly. Burdell himself is on trial. Price is moving heaven and earth to get up forces, and is reported at Pocahontas to-day. Will keep Rosecrans' wants in view, and do all I can for my comrades everywhere. The State military go to plowing instead of soldiering, and Federal troops are my sole reliance.

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
