more and Ohio railroad at Cumberland, and
passing in'a semi-circular form through the
coal region, and connecting again v/it.h the
Baltimore and Ohio railroad at Piedmont.
For the accommodation of the parties con-
cerned and identified with this coal trade large
numbers of houses have been built, involving
all I he savings of years of toil of the laborers
employed; and. as further evidence of the
amount of property identified with this coal
trade, it may be stated that the city of Cum-
berland, which a few years ago had but fifteen
hundred, has now, it is believed, a population
of not less than twelve thousand. With the
prosperity of all that mass of human beings
who have made Alleghany their homes since
this coal trade commenced, in 1842, twenty
joint stock companies, having out certificates
of stock of a face value of §20,000,000, stand
identified for weal or woe.
Making an estimate of all these investments,
and of others here omitted, the committee be-
lieve that more than $00,000,000 is involved
in the Maryland coal region alone in the pros-
ecution of the coal trade for which it was in-
vested. And if to this we add $60,000,000 as
an estimate of the expenditures connected with
the bituminous coai trade of Virginia, West
Virginia, and Pennsylvania, we have more
than $120,000,000, with a large mass of sons
of toil dependent to a great extent on the
result of that movement which has for its
object an abrogation or reduction of the duty
on foreign coal, and an abandonment of a
public policy almost coeval with the national
Government.
In all this we have made no reference to the
anthracite coal trade of Pennsylvania, for the
obvious reason that neither the quality of that
coal which may be sold in market, nor its
price, nor the prosperity of those who are
identified therewith, is involved seriously in
the proposition before Congress which we arc
considering. That coal has been found no-
where but in Pennsylvania, (excepting a small
deposit found in Wales, unavailable for ex-
portation,) and has, as is well known, a fitness
for purposes to which bituminous coal is not
adapted, and will be purchased in markets at
prices which the last-named coal will not
demand, which can be seen on the face of
any price current we may refer to, and from
the. following table, compiled from reliable
information, showing the prices of coal at
several cities in December, 1869 :

The committee have considered it unne-
cessary to invite attention to the mining of
bituminous coal in the interior of our country
beyond the Ohio. The coal of that section is
beyond the reach of any competition with
imported eoal, and is all consumed in the
United States except a small quantity which
is exported to Canada West, where foreign coal
cannot be carried at a profit., either from Liv-
erpool or Nova Scotia. One of the private
parties immediately interested in the coal ques-
tion before Congress are citizens of the United
States, who are mining and sending to market
annually over three million tons of coal, and
who are contributing to the wants of the Gov-
ernment by paying taxes and by consuming
excised and tariffed articles from which the
United States deiives a revenue. The other
private party concerned is composed in part
of citizens of a British province, who pay no
taxes to our Government, and citizens of the
United States who use their capital to build
up a foreign industry.
Of the first-mentioned parties to this ques-
tion we have submitted already to Congress
in this communication explanations, perhaps
too prolix, but which the committee have con-
sidered indispensably required, that Congress
may perceive that the interests involved are
entitled to deliberate consideration. Of the
other private parties concerned we propose to
speak with as much brevity as the case will
permit, and will in the sequel endeavor to
show how far the whole people of the United
States are concerned in the rightful decision
of this question.
It is to be regretted that the public have not
full information concerning the companies
engaged in mining for coal in Nova Scotia.
If the names of all the officers and stockhold-
ers of those companies were known we could
readily judge how far the means used to man-
ufacture a public sentiment on this subject
emanated from men guided by public consid-
erations, and how far such means had their
origin in that personal interest which will bias
the judgment of the best men. In the absence
of this desirable information the committee
submit respectfully to consideration such as
is attainable.
The committee invite especial attention to a
report of the Pictou Mining Company, which
was chartered by the Legislature of Maine and
by the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in
April, 1867, since the expiration of the reci-
procity treaty, and since the tariff on foreign
coal was fixed at $1 25 per ton.
The president and one of the directors of
this company are citizens of Brunswick, Maine ;
the treasurer is a citizen of New York; two
of the directors are of Bath, Maine; one of
them is of Freeport, in the same State ; only
one of the directors in four is British, and the
office of the company is at Augusta, Maine.
From the sixth page of this report we learn
that one of the Nova Scotia mining companies
holds property known as the " Albion mines,"
comprising four square miles, or 2,560 acres,
valued at $3,200,000 United States currency,
and that the company pays a fair dividend upon
their full capital.
From the same page of this report we learn
that the Pictou Mining Company possesses
5,120 acres, adjoining the lands of the Albion
mines, upon which the Pictou Company have
issued a stock of $750,000, and have before
them pecuniary prospects, in the face of the
tariff now imposed by the United States on
foreign coal, as set forth in the following
extracts from their report:
" Why should tlis Pictou Mining Company not
pay a fair dividend, while the Albion mines pay on
more than four times the amount of our capital at
loast seven per cent,.; onesquare mile (6t0acres)with
all the various seams of coal, contains at least fifty
millions (25,000,000?) of tons, quite enough lor one
company's operations for more than one hundred
years? Why may not the remaining territory (4,430
acres) be leased to other companies even at a mod-
erate royalty? Such a revenue alone would bo suf-
ficient to pay a good dividend to the stockholders of
the mother eompany._ The present profits of the
Albion mines are $1 05 United States currency per
ton ; consequently an exportation of 23,000 tons per
year would pay more than six per cent, of dividend
on a capital stock of $750,000; yet 28,000 tons is but a
trifling quantity in comparison with the gigantic
exportation of the Albion mines annually. There
is no reason why the Pictou Mining Company should
not export 50,000 tons the present year, and twice
that amount next."
From page 8 of this same report we learn
from a quotation taken from a report made to
the Legislature that—
" The Nova Scotia fields lie upon tide-water, and
are the only fields on the continent that do. Their
coal can be put on shipboard at as low cost as coal
caa be put on ears or coal-boats in thePonnsylvania
coal-fields, andean be transported in sea-going ves-
sels from the mines to Boston, an average distance
say of four hundred and fifty miles, at a cost not
exceeding the transportation to tide-water of the
Pennsylvania coals, a distance averaging one hun-
dred and twenty miles."
And on pages 14, 15, and 16 of the report
we find the following :
"The cost of mining and transporting coal to the
vessel, and all charges and expenses accruing in and
about tlio same, cannot he computed at more than
eighty ccnts per ton of 2,240 pounds. The royalty
payable to the province is ten cents, making the total
cost of the company ninety cents per ton, but a mar-
gin of ten cents may bo allowed, bringing the cost
up to one dollar per ton. Pictou coal of' like charac-
ter forsteam and gas as ours has been sold the past
year at the vessel's side in Pictou upper harbor
for $2 25 (gold) per ton, leaving for profit SI 65 per
too, United States currency." * * * " In
conclusion I liaveno hesitation in expressing my firm
conviction, derived from the foregoing intimate per-
sonal knowledge of the property, acquired in the
manner hereinbefore set forth, that its real present
value can only be calculated by millions of doilars,
and that an investment now of §5,000 in the same
will yield a revenue within two years of $1,000 per
annum, with the certainty of a dividend to the
amountof the par value of the stock; ($750,000.)from
sales of surplus square' miles, if deemed expedient
by the stockholders, or tho leasing, asi beforo men-
tioned, of same for a royalty, which is preferable,
and then leaving us sufficient territory for the pro-
duction of 300,000 tons of coal per annum, for an
indefinite number of years, after the great-grand-
ehildren of the present stockholders shall have
passed away."
In connection with these extracts from the
report of the secretary of the Pictou company,
it is proper to remark that he errs if he sup-
poses that the average distance on which the
bituminous coals of Pennsylvania have to be
transported by rail from the mines to Phila-
delphia is one hundred and twenty miles. That
may be the average distance by canal and rail-
road from the anthracite coal mines to Phila-
delphia. But, for reasons heretofore stated,
there is no perceptible competition between
anthracite and Nova Scotia coals. The dis-
tances, from the several bituminous and semi-
bituminous coal mines of the United States,
with the production of which the coals of Nova
Scotia come in competition, to the Atlantic
cities, are a3 follows:

Further to illustrate the prospects and pur-
poses of the miners of Nova Scotia coal, for
whose benefit more especially it is proposed
to deprive the Treasury of the United States
of $500,000 annually, now derived from duties
on importations of foreign coal, we respect-
fully submit for the consideration of Congress
the following tabular statements:
Expenditures for adits, levels, drains, shafts,
slopes, machinery, houses, railways, breakwaters,
dredging, wharves, harbors. &c., for the years 1866,
1867, and 1868, carefully compiled from facts fur-
nished by the reports of tho chief commissioners of
mines for the province of Nova Scotia:

1867   255,107 38
186 8  625,?>.j2 33
Total $1,229,139 55
This table is submitted to show that the ex-
penditures, with a view to increase the business
of mining in that province, have not ceased
by reason of the expiration of the reciprocity
treaty, and in view of the continuance by Con-
gress of the tariff as it is on foreign coal. The
expenditures for the year 1868 exceed the ex-
pendituresforeitlier ofthetwo preceding years.
The Nova Scotia mining companies, it seems.,
have more cheerful anticipations for the futuro,
without the aid of congressional legislation in
their favor, than those who champion their cause
outside of the jurisdiction of Nova Scotia.
