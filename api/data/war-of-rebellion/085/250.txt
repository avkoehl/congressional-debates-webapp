WARRENSBURG, September 19, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Saint Louis:

One hundred and thirty guerrillas crossed the Missouri River to the north side on Friday morning last just below Dover. This is probably the band I telegraphed you of yesterday had passed through La Fayette County north-Todd's.

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

WARRENSBURG, MO., September 19, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

I learn by telegraph from Lexington that 150 guerrillas attacked a camp of thirty militia in Ray County, seven miles from Lexington, yesterday evening. The militia were badly cut up. The guerrillas started in the direction of Harden, down the Missouri River. This is probably the band that crossed below Dover.

The following dispatch just received from General Sanborn:

SPRINGFIELD, MO., September 19, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A band of 110 rebels are in Laclede County to-day and moving rapidly in a northwest direction. Major Cosgrove, commanding at Lebanon, thinks this force will cross the Osage about twelve or fifteen miles from Linn Creek. I have a good force on their trail, but it is doubtful if they can be brought to a stand.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

The general commanding directs that you keep a lookout for this force, holding your troops well in hand and be ready to concentrate.

FRANK S. BOND,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.
