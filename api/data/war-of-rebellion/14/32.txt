What force is there at Manassas Junction and who is in command there?

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

General Sumner commands the troops in vicinity of Manassas. He has brigade of infantry and a regiment of cavalry at Manassas itself, two brigades at Union Mills, a division at Fairfax. Until the railway bridge at Union Mills is finished it is next to impossible to supply any large force beyond Bull Run. Banks' division is on the march to Centreville from Winchester. One brigade was, however, ordered back last night to support Shields. Union Mills Bridge will be completed to-morrow, and I shall then strengthen Manassas and occupy Warrenton Junction. General Summer has pushed his reconnaissances to Gainesville, which was found abandoned. it is his opinion that the scouts of the enemy are very weak. Until we can put forage across Bull Run by the railroad it will not be in our power to keep a large cavalry force in front of Manassas.

What is condition of fords over Bull Run? enemy reappeared yesterday near Winchester, and, although reported defeated, seem still to be there. Hard to tell in what force, but I do not think large. Can you manage supplies so as to push all your troops across Bull Run and drive the enemy out of Warrenton Junction? Can you maintain an additional cavalry force in that direction before Union Mills Bridge is completed? What is condition of roads beyond Bull Run?
