pie, so that politically tlie whole country is lapsing
into demoralization."
On this point I also present extracts from
the report of the joint select committee ap-
pointed by Congress to inquire into the con-
dition of affairs in the late insurrectionary
States, which report was made to Congress in
the month of February last. The extracts
I make relate njainly to the corruptions and
financial bankruptcy that has been brought
upon those States by this Radical policy, as
follows:
*4 We have endeavored to give somewhat in detail
the result of the reconstruction policy of Congrv?s
on the financial condition of the southern States,
together with the character of their registration and
election laws, and we feel warranted in asserting to
Congress and the country that the whole system has
been one of plunder and oppression; whenever and
wherever schemes could be concocted to enrich the
officials, they were consummated by bribery and cor-
ruption at the expense of the tax-payers; whenever
and wherever it was necessary to destroy or abridge
the right of suffrage, or to stuff the ballot-box for
party purposes, it was resorted tc ; when it was best
to stir up stnf'eso as to furnish a pretext for oppres-
sion or asubversion of the popular will,it was done;
in short, every means was applied and every device
was resorted to which the worst and most unscru-
pulous class of adventurers could invent, to enrich
themselves and impoverish the people over whom
they were placed, by the most wicked and cruel sys-
tem that human ingenuity could devise. A glance
at the meu whom Congr- ss imposed as Governors of
these States, illustrates the character of the whole
machinery and the materials of which it is com-
posed. The subordinates, whose obscurity afforded
them protection, were, on an average, worse than
the Governors, who. being more exposed to public
gaze, had to observe a certain decent respect for
public opinion which their inferiors did not feel;
the subordinates, therefore, indulged their lust for
wealth and power more unscrupulously than those
who were Governors dared to do."
"The public recordsof the country show that Gov-
ernor Holden, of North Carolina, has been success-
fully impeached for high crimes aod misdemeanors,
Republicans uniting in so doing. Reed, of Florida,
has just been impeached by his own Legislatuie.
Bullock fled from Georgia to escape certain convic-
tion. Smith, of Alabama, wa^s guilty of issuing at
least $500,000 of the bonds of that State fraudulently
to the managers of the Alabama and Chattanooga
railroad. Brownlow, while in Tennessee, tyran-
mzedover that people in the most shameless man-
ner, being equaled in that regard only by Davis,
of Texas. Scott, of South Carolina, barely escaped
impeachment even from his corrupt Legislature.
"We will forbear in this report trom speaking of the
present status of Warmoth, of Louisian >, and Clay-
too, of Arkansas, as they are now undergoing in-
vestigation before committees of the Senate and
House. Virginia escaped, and Mississippi elected
one of her own large pioperty-holders, which par-
tially saved her.
"With such leaders and such examples, it was
inevitable that the subordinates would be corrupt.
The fountains of justice were poisoned, and the
streams were of course impure. Punishments for
offenses, especially for bribery, corruption, or extor-
tion, became impossible when nearly all in author-
ity were equally guilty. They agreed in one thing,
and that was to silence all complaints by professions
of loyalty and devotion to the party in power, and
by denunciations loud and deep of those complain-
ing as rebels and traitors, who were persecuting them
becausc of their loyalty. For a time they succeeded,
but they occasionally quarreled over the division of
the spoils, and then the facts would leak out, as
they now are doing in Louisiana and South Caro-
lina.
"Truth is mighty, and public justice in the end cer-
tain. The mills of the gods grind slowly, but they
grind exceedingly fine. The water is being turned
on, hence the piteous howls for protection which
these miscreants urc sendingup from all quarters to
the Government at Washington to save them iroin
the just condemnation which awaits them.
"A substantial recapitulation of the debts and lia-
bilities, actual and contingent, of the several States
aa States, is perhaps necessary.
"Ivo idea can be given of the amount of their local
burdens.

"The aggregate increase of the debts and liabili-
ties of these several States will be found greatly to
exceed $200,000,000. The fact that as soon as any
of these States escape from the clutehes of these
vultures they begin to reduce their debts and
husband their resources, ought to convince all men
interested in the welfare and prosperity of the coun-
try that a change of rulers is not only necessary, but
indispensable."
ku kltjx act.
Another striking evidence of the fatal re-
sults of reconstruction is found in the passage
by the party in power, at the first session of
the present Congress, of an act to enforce
the provisions of the fourteenth amendment
of the Constitution, commonly known as the
11 Ku Klux act." This fourteenth is the
famous reconstruction "plank"—the "dis-
ability," " social equality " amendment. In
this act we have a remarkable commentary on
Radical statesmanship. After six years tam-
pering with this pet policy, and after enacting
sundry other enforcement acts, "the wise
men of the East" pass another act to enforce
said amendment, by wbichthey expect to heal
up the festering infirmities of reconstruction.
And as evidence of the desperate condition of
things produced by their policy in the South,
they clothe the President with imperial powers,
by authorizing him, when in his judgment the
public safety shall require it, to suspend the
writ of habeas corpus, that great writ that has
stood the bulwark of personal liberty for two
hundred years, and never suspended but twice
before in this country. Surely reconstruction
has made a sad wreck of the South, to require
such an extreme remedy as the suspension of
this sacred writ, at the will of the President.
conclusion,
These remarks have extended beyond ex-
pectation, and I will close by referring to
one more of the results of reconstruction.
I take pleasure in stating that this result is
one, though not intended, that studs the cloud
with the bow of promise, and makes the heart
of the patriot glad. I refer to the fact that
the great and good men of the Republican
party are turning their backs upon the mon-
ster, reconstruction. They have seen its deso-
lating and disastrous effects, and are fleeing
from it. This reckless spirit of Radicalism,
that defies the Constitution of the fathers of
the Republic, that sneers at the sarietitv of
official oaths, and scoffs at solemn pledges,
has blasted the blessings of peace and the
supremacy of the Federal Constitution. Crit-
tenden feared it., and hence his patriotic reso-
lution to guard against it. General McClellan
saw its tendency in the midst of the war, and
retired from the Army. Hancock, and Bates,
and Blair, and Schurz, and Glover, and
scores of civil and military veterans, took a
bold stand against it, before and soon after th e
war closed ; and later still, Gratz Brown, and
Greeley, and Trumbull, and Davis, with many
others; and last and best, the honest masses of
the Republican party are coming to the rescue,
determined to put the monster down, restore
the Government to its proper balance, and
deliver it from corruption. And as a crown-
ing event in this great movement comes the
Cincinnati convention of Liberal Republicans,
with a majesty and strength that is causing the
Radical elements to tremble and turn pale.
remedies.
I am reminded that I am expected be-
fore closing to state remedies for the evils
presented. It gives me pleasure to state very
briefly that the remedies to me are plain. Re-
peal your disability laws; grant general am-
nesty ; put the white man on an equal footing
with the negro; give intelligent men that will
not steal a fair chance in the affairs of State ;
repeal your reconstruction and enforcement,
laws, and withdraw from Congress your social
equality bills, that are engendering and pro-
moting strife and bitterness between the white
and colored races ; respect the dignity, equal-
ity, and rights of the States that created and
limited the powers of the Federal Govern-
ment ; deal justly and in good faith with all
classes; and loyalty, good order, fraternal
feeling, peace, and prosperity will follow.
The Tariff.
SPEECH OF HON. II. MAYNARD,
OP TJSNNKSSEJS,
In the House of Representatives,
May 2, 1872.
The House being in Committee of the Whole on
the stateof the Union, and having under considera-
tion the bill(H. It. No. 2322) to reduco duties on im-
ports, and to reduce internal taxes, and for other
purposes-
Mr. MAYNARD said:
Mr. Chairman : A general belief prevails
that our public receipts are at present too
large, and that good policy as well as justice
to the tax-payers require us to reduce them.
jLhe Secretary of the Treasury, in his estimates
,™ "ext-vearPuts the receipts at $359,000,-
000, and the expenditures at $301,705,030 99.
I do not propose to examine the estimates
of expenditures. That duty properly belongs
to the Committee on Appropriations, and is to
be considered when we examine the appropri-
ate bills. Some gentlemen have imagined
that they saw an opportunity to look at the
subject from a partisan and political point of
view, and have attempted to show that the
expenditures under the present Administra-
tion are relatively much greater than were
the expenditures prior to the war under the
administration of Mr. Buchanan.
Without taking the time now, I am prepared
to show to any gentleman who desires the
information that these expenditures, as rec-
ommended by the Secretary of the Treasury,
