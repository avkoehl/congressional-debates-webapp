cavalry, previously ordered to our right flank, is now sent back to the left on account of this demonstration. Movement to destroy railroads is postponed, to await arrival of apparatus for the purpose, ordered from Washington yesterday. Since June 2, when I last reported the arrival of re-enforcements, the returns show that there have been added to this army 19,190 men. This includes Eighteenth Corps, whose field returns of yesterday show 10,324 men. Its casualties in action are 2,000, leaving 4,000 missing from its original number of 16,000 and upward. As it has lost no prisoners these 4,000 are stragglers, most of whom will come in. At the outset of the campaign the other corps had very nearly as great a proportion of stragglers, but now they suffer much less from that cause. But even in Hancock's corps there are 1,200 men unaccounted for since the battle of Friday. Total number of this army, with cavalry included, is 115,000 fighting men. Generals Grant and Meade agree that Lee's whole command here and south of Richmond is now 80,000, exclusive of any mere militia that may have been at Richmond. Weather cloudy. It rained during the night.

HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,Cold Harbor, Va., June 5, 1864-6 p.m. (Received 5 a.m., 6th.)

Day passed quietly, with no fighting except an occasional rattle of musketry from the skirmish line, and now and then a cannon-shot. The Fifth Corps is ordered to move out of lines to-night and mass itself is reserve just in rear of Cold Harbor. The Ninth Corps, which is thus left upon extreme right, is directed to refuse itself, according to the formation of the ground, from the right of the Eighteenth Corps, near the Woody house, in the direction of Old Church, crossing the Matadequin about Allen's Mill. Two divisions of the Cavalry Corps are to be held ready to move up the railroad on morning of the 7th, to destroy them from the nearest practicable point to South Anna. Thence the cavalry moves to Charlottesville, and thence send forward force to communicate with General Hunter and to destroy railroad bridges southward. General Hunter is to be ordered to return from his expedition to Lynchburg, and joining Sheridan's command, aid in the thorough destruction of the Virginia Central, moving along its line in this direction. Having accomplished that work he is to join this army. The cavalry division which Sheridan leaves behind here will have to cover both our flanks, but the task will be made easy by new position of Ninth Corps on our right, while on left Second Corps is to extend its pickets down the Chickahominy, and thus relieve some of the cavalry heretofore employed in that direction. Sheridan thinks we shall have no difficulty in crossing the Chickahominy at Jones' Bridge and below. Weather clearing up.
