On a round voyage of a steamer of 407 tons between this port and that of New Orleans the period of fifteen days is reckoned. Upon this idea the Cardenas ought to have made a voyage and a half in the twenty-two days she was detained, and using as bases the net product of that she had just completed (if she had not been delayed), amounting to $8,300, the company would have earned for a voyage and a half.............................. $12,450

----------

Total.......................................... 16,347

It results that the Cuban Steam Navigation Company, which we conduct, has suffered damages to the amount of $16,347 by the detention of twenty-two days at the port of New Orleans of their steamer Cardenas.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

In accordance with your instructions I have authorized raising of two additional cavalry regiments, to wit: The Fourteenth, to be raised at Peoria, by D. P. Jenkins; the Fifteenth, also at Peoria, by Captain Hancock, U. S. Army. I have also authorized Major Stweart to fill up his battalion to a regiment, to be known as the Sixteenth, and Major Thielemenn's to be the Seventeenth.

BOSTON, MASS., September 17, 1862.

Honorable P. H. WATSON:

Before receiving your answer Pennsylvania had bought the muskets at the price I named, adding the exchange, which made the cost &19,87. The parties have 18,000 more, which they will sell the United States on the same terms-that is, $16,50, exchange added. Pennsylvania will take them at these terms. Answer at once.

WM. SCHOULER,

Adjutant-General.
