ferries at intermediate points, as Stigall's, Waitsborough, Newell's, mouth of Fishing Creek, Hart's, Mill Springs, and Robertsport. The river hill prevents communication in most cases between one point and another by direct routes, so that if troops are broken into detachments they could not be concentrated on the river without great loss of time. I think it will be best to keep pretty strong guard along the river, and hold the main force at some central point, where the enemy can be met and defeated. Your plan of keeping rebels from crossing can be carried out by increasing the force here, so that after being divided it will still be strong enough to defend itself. I think this is the strategic point, but guards should be kept about mouth of Greasy Creek and fords in that vicinity.

General ROSECRANS, Murfreesborough, Tenn.:

The following just received from Carter:

Major [William N.] Owens, First Division Cavalry, now stationed at Mill Springs, has just advised me that he has reliable information of Breckinridge's command being camped at Steubenville, 5 miles this side of Monticello, and three brigades of cavalry between that place and Waitsborough. Matters begin to look squally. Has Colonel Jacob returned to Greasy Creek? Some troops should be there or at Jamestown, if I should be forced to fall back.

CARTER.

I am not inclined to believe this. Have you any information in regard to it?

General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky., and

General WILLCOX, Lexington, Ky.:

The following has just been received from Rosecrans:

All our news up to last night goes to show that Breckinridge, with his command, is at Wartrace. We have had scouts in every day from south and east. Possibly this is a canard on Carter, that W. H. [W. C. P.] Breckinridge, colonel of cavalry, is there.

General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky., and

General WILLCOX, Lexington, Ky.:

The following is just received from Rosecrans:

One of our scouts says Wheeler, Morgan, and Pegram are all concentrating near Livingston, which seems to confirm your news. They have most probably 5,000 or 6,000 men.
