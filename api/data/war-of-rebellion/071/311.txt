Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I reported to General Wright, at Offutt's Cross-Roads, at 2 o'clock this morning, intending to go forward with him. My horse fell with me, and so severely injured my foot that I cannot put it to the ground or ride on horseback. I have ordered Brigadier-General Emory to go forward with the First Division, Nineteenth Corps. Am returning to Tennallytown, and will remain there for more troops, hoping to be able to ride forward in a day or two. Ten regiments of the Nineteenth Corps were to move forward from Tennallytown at 7 o'clock this morning.
