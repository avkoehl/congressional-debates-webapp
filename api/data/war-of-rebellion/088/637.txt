organize the brigades, subject to approval. If the choice of commanders can be left to me I will make it; if not, I wish the major-general commanding to make the selection himself.

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,September 1, 1864.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

According to the returns of the regiments of the old First Corps, exclusive of the regiments of the Maryland Brigade, the aggregate present is 5,785. The field return for August 21 is 11,642 aggregate. It will be seen that the one division of the old First Corps will comprise nearly one-half of my command.

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 1, 1864 - 2.30 p. m.

Major General G. K. WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

Paragraph 2 of Special Orders Numbers 236, of this date, from these headquarters, is so far modified as to authorize you to reorganize the Fifth Corps into two divisions instead of three, one division to be composed of the old First Corps and the other of the Fifth Corps; and you can carry this arrangement into effect without further reference of the subject to these headquarters. You will, however, report the names of such staff officers, if any, as may be rendered supernumerary by the change.

By command of Major-General Meade:

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Respectfully,

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 1, 1864 - 4.45 p. m.

Major General G. K. WARREN,

General Meade has left the army to be absent a few days. He expected, however, that, as the senior officers, Generals Griffin and Crawford would be assigned to the command of your two divisions.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
