probably the knowledge of General Smith's absence with a large portion of his command might stimulate the tory element to action. I have received information that Clift, who was dislodged at Huntsville, Tenn., the other day, but not disorganized, will make an attempt with a cavalry regiment to destroy the bridge at Loudon or some other vulnerable point. It is therefore advisable to keep a sufficient force there to repel any probable attack, Colonel [D.] Coleman's [Thirty-ninth North Carolina] regiment, which is very inefficient, might be sent you if Colonel Smith's command there is strong enough. I have called for a report from him, but have not yet received one.

I shall endeavor, general, to conform to your wishes and send forward troops to you, but you are mistaken as to their location and of the North Carolina troops. Colonel [R. G. A.] Love's [Sixty-second North Carolina] regiment and Lieutenant Colonel [L. M.] Allen's [Eleventh North Carolina] battalion [probably included in your calculation] were only ordered to camps of instruction at Jonesborough and Greenville a few days ago. They are new, hardly organized, and scarcely yet assembled at those points. Colonel [Joseph A.] McDowell's [Sixtieth North Carolina] regiment is collecting in a camp of instruction at Warm Springs, N. C. Colonel Fain is commandant of this post, assigned by General Smith, vice Colonel Davis, now with him.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE, Knoxville, Tenn., August 23, 1862.

Colonel S. J. SMITH,Commanding, &amp;c., Loudon, Tenn.:

COLONEL: I have reason to believe that the force of the enemy under Clift, recently dislodged from Huntsville, Tenn., is not broken up nor disorganized, but is only awaiting an opportunity to attack some vulnerable point-probably Loudon. You will therefore direct your cavalry to scout in the direction of Kingston, especially to the northward of the road from that place, keeping out strong pickets to give timely notice of any advance of the enemy from toward Childer's Gap, but in doing this other avenues of approach must not be neglected.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. BELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
