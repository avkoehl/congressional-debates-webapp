Hampton, after driving enemy's cavalry upon his infantry, on afternoon of 8th recrossed the Nottoway and reached Belfield at daylight yesterday. In the afternoon enemy attacked the position, but were successfully resisted. This morning enemy is reported retiring and Hampton following. The bridge over the Meherrin was saved. Our loss, as far as known, small. The garrison, under Garnett, and the reserves behaved well.

PETERSBURG, December 10, 1864.

About noon yesterday the First Division of Second Corps of enemy, supporting their cavalry, forced back our cavalry pickets on the Vaughan road south of the Appomattox and advanced toward Dinwiddie Court-House. To-day our cavalry, re-enforced by infantry, drove them back across Hatcher's Run, capturing a few prisoners, and re-established, our lines. General Longstreet made a reconnaissance of enemy's lines to-day on north side of James River as far as New Market Heights, driving in their pickets, and found them fortified along the whole distance.

General Leventhorpe reports the enemy attempted, on the 20th, to land a force at Poplara Point, three miles from Fort Branch, on the Roanoke. The attacking party consisted of three gun-boats and barges loaded with troops. After a combat of three hours they were repulsed with loss. The attack was renewed on 21st and their skirmishers landed, which were attacked and driven to the boats. The gun-boats have resumed the position they occupied previous to their attempt to land troops at Poplar Point.
