names in this bill.
Mr. INGERSOLL. Let me hear them.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Shall I insert
other names in their place?

I move that he be struck out.
The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman yield
for that motion?
Mr. INGERSOLL. I ask his authority for
making the motion. Has he any letter from
him ?
Mr. BROOKS, of Now York. I have the
most authentic information a man can have.

Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I have the
best authority.
Mr. INGERSOLL. Have you any letter
from this gentleman?
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. No, I have
no letter.
Mr. INGERSOLL. Then by what authority
do you move to strike his name out?
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Suppose he
told me so.
Mr. INGERSOLL. Then let the gentleman
say so and I will let him make the motion.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I have not,
the honor of the acquaintance of these gentle-
men ; but I have a list of the names of those
who do not want to bo in. I move to strike out
the name of" Azariah Boody.'' He is a con-
stituent of mine, and I am informed by several
of my constituents that he does not wish to
be in.

of "Azariah Boody" is out?
Mr. INGERSOLL. Yes, sir.
Mr. RANDALL. I ask the gentleman from
Illinois to yield t.o me.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I wish to get through
with the gentleman from New York first.

tenden does not want his name in.
Mr. INGERSOLL. Very well; strike him
out.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I move to
strike him out.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Let me ask
the gentleman from Illinois by what authority
he has put in the name of James D. Cameron?
Mr. INGERSOLL. What, authority have
you for striking it out?
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. As good
authority as you have to put it in. His friends
say he does not want his name in.

Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I move to
strike him out.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. A. S. Diven,
of New York, a railroad man, does not wish to
be in any such railroad as this.

Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I have been
so informed by his intimate friends.
Mr. INGERSOLL. Who are they?
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. If the gentle-
man will allow me I will telegraph him.
Mr. INGERSOLL. If the gentleman takes
the responsibility as the friend of this man to
strike him outlam in favor of striking him out.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I move to
strike him oat.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. Strike them all out.
Mr. BROOKS,of New York. Without going
further into detail, I hope the gentleman from
Illinois will give me permission to strike out
all of these names, and leave it to the Commit-
tee on the Judiciary 01- some other committee
to name the incorporators. If this charter be
worth $10,000,000 we should be careful as to
the names of the corporators.
Mr. INGERSOLL. It is very kind of the
gentleman, but I cannot yield for that.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Then I must
try it more in detail.
Mr.INGERSOLL. Well, go on. [Laughter.]
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Charles W.
Durant isa constituent of mine, andlam quite
sure he does not want to be in this bill.
Mr. INGERSOLL. How do you know?
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I cannot say
that 1 have any authority.
Mr. INGERSOLL. Then I must stop you
right here. 1 decline to yield further.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I am sorry
for that.
Mr. RANDALL. Will the gentleman from
Illinois allow mo to put in some names?
Mr. INGERSOLL. I yield to the gentleman
from Ohio [Mr. Wi^aks] to offer an amend-
ment.
The SPEAKER. This can only be done by
unanimous consent; there are two amendments
already pending.
Mr. WINANS. I desire to insert the name
of "John G. Mitchell" after the word "Baker"
in the sixteenth line of the first section.
There being no objection, the amendment
was agreed to.
Mr. O'NEILL. I desire to insert some
names at the request of gentlemen residing in
Pennsylvania.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I will hear them.
Mr. O'NEILL. The names are "Ilenry
Lewis, E. C. Knight, Charles Gibbons, Charles
Smith, and Samuel T. Canby."
Mr. INGERSOLL. I desire to address a
question or two to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania, [Mr. O'Neill.J
Mr. O'NEILL. I know these gentlemen
personally and well, and I will say 
Mr. INGERSOLL. Nothing farther at pres-
ent. [Laughter.] Are they interested in the
present line of' railroad between this city and
New York?
Mr. O'NEILL. I do not think they are. I
think they are just such men as, if their names
are put into this bill, and if it is ever intended
to build this road, will help materially to
build it.
Mr. INGERSOLL. Then I hope that they
will be voted in. [Laughter.] I move that
those names be inserted.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I now yield to the gen-
tleman from New York, [Mr. McCarthy.]
Mr. McCARTHY. The gentleman from
New York [Mr. Brooks] in striking out,
names struck out one of my constituents. I
do not know what authority he had for it, but
I ask the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Inger-
soll] to allow me to substitute another and
better name in the place of the one struck out.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I will.
Mr. McCARTHY. I move that the name
of "Elias W. Leavenworth" be inserted in
the place of "H. W. Chittenden."
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. As I was
allowed to strike out some names I think I
should have the privilege of putting some in
their place. 1 object to this arrangement.
[Laughter.]
The SPEAKER. This can only be by unan-
imous consent, there being two amendments
now pending.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I do not
object to the name of Mr. Leavenworth, pro-
vided you allow me to put in a name or two
also.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I will hear the names,
and let the Honse vote on them.
Mr. McKENZIE. I ask the gentleman to
yield to me to move certain amendments.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I yield to the gentle-
man.
Mr. McKENZIE. I move that the follow-
ing names be inserted: "J. S. Kennedy, of
New York, and J. L. King, of Springfield,
Massachusetts." They are two first-rate men,
and will assist materially in building the road.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I desire to inquire of
the gentleman from Virginia if he is in favor
of the proposition to build a road from this
city to New York?
Mr. McKENZIE. I am.
Mr. INGERSOLL; Do you know anything
about these men ?
Mr. McKENZIE. I do ; and both of them
are in favor of the road.
Mr. INGERSOLL. Are they men of capital?
Mr. McKENZIE. They are men of means.
Mr. INGERSOLL. Then I vote for their
admission. [Laughter.]
Mr. McKenzie'samendment was agreed to.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I now yield to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey, [Mr. Haiciit.]
Mr. HAIGHT. I desire to say that if the
gentleman from Illinois wants to have this road
built and will accept my amendment he will
have a portion of the road already built and
ready for immediate use, which will expedite
his enterprise, if it can be called an enterprise.
I desire the second section of the act amended
so that the road shall cross the Delaware river
at or near the city of Camden, iu the State of
New Jersey, with power to connect with the
Camden and Atlantic and the New Jersey
Southern Railroad Companies, and run to a
point opposite the city of New York, on the
Raritan bay, or Sandy Hook bay, and then cross
the Raritan bay and Hudson river by ferry to
the city of New York. And I desire to state
to the gentleman from Illinois that when this
matter was pending before Congress some eight
or ten years ago this very line was marked out
by the friends and supporters of this railroad.
Those who were supporting this very measure
and advocating this kind of legislation expected
and desired that the route of the road through
New Jersey would be as I have indicated m
my proposed amendment, and I think if the
gentleman from Illinois recollected what was
done or said at that time he would not object
to the amendment, and I think it once passed
this House with a provision of that kind in it
and was defeated iu the Senate. The very
originators, the men who started this enter-
prise, had no other idea in view at its inception.
They proposed to locate the road and run it
on the routes of the railroads I have named.
Does the gentleman accept my amendment?
Mr. INGERSOLL.* I do not see why we
should confine the proposed corporation to
pass through the city of New Jersey in the
State of Amboy, [laughter,] or Camden I should
have said, and not leave them to go where they
picasÂ©.
Mr. HAIGHT. I will tell him why: because
a great many Illinois men are interested in
this enterprise, and we want to give them some
idea of the principles of this Government and
the rights of the States.
Mr. POTTER. 1 desire to suggest the name
of a constituent Of mine who has been a great
