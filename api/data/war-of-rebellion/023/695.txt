KNOXVILLE, TENN., June 20 1862.

General BRAXTON BRAGG, Tupelo, Miss.:

Cumberland Gap, being turned was abandoned to prevent its investment; my command concentrating along the railroad. This valley and railroad is of vital importance and should not be abandoned without a struggle. An immediate re-enforcement of at least two brigades is necessary to insure success.

E. KIRBY SMITH.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., June 20, 1862.

Captain J. M. GALT,

Commanding Post, Lynchburg, Va.:

CAPTAIN: Arms are very much needed in this department. Major General E. Kirby Smith directs me to ask if you cannot furnish 500 stand, which are required for the immediate use of his command. Major T. W. Adrian has been ordered to proceed to Lynchburg, with authority to receive from you such quantity as can be supplied there. A large portion of our cavalry are unarmed. Carbines and shot-guns or arms suitable for mounted men are greatly wanted, and a supply at this time would add material to our means of defense of this important department, now threatened on all sides by the enemy.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. BELTON.

[JUNE 20, 1862. - For order of the President assigning Bragg permanently to command of Western Department, see Series I, Vol. XVII, Part II, p. 614.
