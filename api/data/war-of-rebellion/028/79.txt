HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 13, 1862-3 p. m.

General KELLEY,

Commanding Cumberland, Md.:

Governor Curtin reports that he has been informed that a force of rebels were within 8 miles of Concord, in Franklin Country, this morning, and that they stole 1,500 horses last night. This may be a part of Stuart's cavalry, which went to Chambersburg. Please direct all your commanders to keep a sharp lookout for their return, and keep scouts well out toward the Pennsylvania line, so as to intercept them, if possible.

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.

The following just received:

PERRYVILLE, via MIFFLIN.

GOV. ANDREW G. CURTIN:

The rebels are in Franklin Country, reported to be making for this road, said and thought to have been 30,000 strong. They captured 1,500 head of horses. I left last night at 12 o'clock; reached Perryville 8 o'clock this morning. Before I left, the rebels were 8 miles from Concord, my residence, Franklin Country. A very reliable man brought the news to me. The farmers of Franklin Country were conveying their horses to Perry Country.

SAMUEL A. JUNKIN.

I am trying to get further information. The person is a reliable

man. We have 3,000 raw troops here, but have no artillery or cavalry. I earnestly ask that cavalry and artillery be ordered to be ready to come here, so that, if true, we can have the troops at once. If it turns out to be true, and we have troops and quick movements, we may catch them this time. General Andrew Porter is here, and is in my counsel.

A. G. CURTIN.
