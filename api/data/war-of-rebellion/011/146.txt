tinels, and the commanding general will call upon officers and sentinels frequently for their orders and instructions, and will not fail to notice the officers who instruct the men.

To prevent straggling the following rules will be observed:

On a march, each company will have two men, with their full equipments, with their company wagons; these men must be with the wagon, and never leave it except in case help is asked by some of the regimental train. All others must be with their companies. In camp, every soldier and company officer will be near his musket stack on the color line or in the company tent. No captain can send his men away. In case it is necessary to send a man away on business, the brigadier or colonel or one of their staff officers must give a written pass, explaining the object. This pass must be for the occasion, and may be in pencil. Soldiers found away from their camps may be arrested by any guard and put to work on roads, digging sinks, gathering wood, water, or any useful labor at once, and sent to his proper company at "retreat".

The three roll call-"reveille," retreat," and "tattoo"-mist be strictly attended, and absentees punished as above. In flagrant cases regimental or brigade court-martial will punish by fines and more severe punishment. In case of alarm, night or day, regiments [will] form on their parades promptly and wait for orders, but any one who occasions false alarms must be promptly punished. Soldiers of other divisions or brigade found loitering in our camp must be arrested, put to work until "retreat," and then allowed to go to their own camps, and the commanding general will notify other division commanders that he will expect the same on their part.

When soldiers or teamsters are noisy or mutinous or abusive, any officer on the spot must summarily prevent it, by tying them up, and using such other means as he may think proper.

The commanding general believes all this will be unnecessary if company officers will explain to their men the importance of this order. If persuasion won't do, the honor and safety of this army will justify the most extreme measures.

By order of Major General W. T. Sherman:
