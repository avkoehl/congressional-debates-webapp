down the Valley, Kershaw's division in front, and encamped on each side of Woodstock (see plate ---*), Rosser's division of cavalry going to Fairview and Lomax's to Front Royal (see plate ---*).

Marching at 6 a. m. on the 11th, Pegram's division in front, preceded by Payne's brigade of cavalry, we drove the enemy's pickets from Middletown and up to a line of fortifications beyond Newtown; then formed a line of battle between Middletown and Newtown and had some skirmishing with the enemy (see plate ---*), Rosser came by the Back and Middle roads to the left of Newtown (see plate ---*) and had some fighting with the enemy (see plate ---). Lomax came up on the right and extended toward Cedarville (see plate ---*). We spent the 12th in line of battle at the same place. Rosser engaged the enemy's cavalry, and part of his force was driven some distance by them along the Back road, but bringing upu the rest he in turn routed Custer's division (see plate ---*). McCausland's brigade, of Lomax's division, repulsed several attacks of the enemy near Cedarville, but it was finally driven from there and lost 2 pieces of artillery. We fell back to Fisher's Hill after dark (see plate ---*). On the 13th the army, Grimes' brigade in front, marched to camps between Edenburg and Hawkinstown, and on the 14th, Gordon in front, we returned to camps in the vicinity of New Market (see plate ---*). Colonel William Proctor Smith reported on the 14th as chief engineer of the Army of the Valley and assumed control of the engineer department of the same, and the operations of the army from that time to the close of the campaign have been reported by him.
