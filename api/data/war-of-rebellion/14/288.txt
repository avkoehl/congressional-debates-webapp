
ever. If not attacked during this day I will have the men ready to repulse the enemy to-morrow. General Ferry is here. Our losses have been very heavy, for we have fought every day since last Tuesday. I have not yielded an inch of ground unnecessarily, but have retired to prevent the superior force of the enemy from cutting me off and to take a different base of operations.

I thank you for the re-enforcements. Every 1,000 men you send at once will held me much.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have intelligence from General McClellan's headquarters to 6 p. m. yesterday. There was very little fighting up to that hour. An attack on our left was repulsed. The report from Williamsburg is in. The enemy has not come this side of New Kent Court-House. Our pickets there are in sight of each other.

FORT MONROE, July 2-9.50 p.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

We drove back the enemy's pickets this morning some 4 miles. They are near New Kent Court-house, and said to be in force between that point and White House. They gave some indications of withdrawing but I distrust them.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 2, 1862.

General S. WILLIAMS, Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: Please order Colonel Farnsworth and Colonel Averell at one to take all the cavalry that can be collected, with the exception of two squadrons, and go back to assist in covering the rear of our column and in bringing up artillery and troops. Instruct them to go as far back toward Porter's old camp as possible, and to remain in rear long enough to get up all the wagons possible. If they find any impossibilities in getting them along, let them destroy them and drive forward the animals. Tell them expressly that the commanding general relies on them to fulfil all that can be done by cavalry. Send other regiments or companies under their command if they can be found, and if Colonel Gregg is here let him to sent to assist.

Respectfully,

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.
