If we had a battery I believe we could go into Tennessee and then if we could carry arms or even powder and lead to furnish to our people I believe we could stay there.

Will help ever come? I do not mean contingent aid but special and direct.

We are getting along well. Most of our men have returned who left on night of 13th and all are elated at the orders to remain here. If it be possible have it so arranged that the Eastern Tennesseeans shall not again except in case of urgent and pressing necessity be ordered back toward Cantral Kentucky. Many would sooner perish in battle than turn their backs toward the Tennessee line again.

Brigadier General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Commanding, &amp;c., Lebanon, Ky.

GENERAL: * * * We have some rebels in camp from Scott County, East Tenn. They were brought in yesterday by some Tennesseeans and Kentuckians. They have been noted for the bitterness of their enmity to the union cause and the unrelenting manner in which they have persecuted loyal men. Four of them are said to be members of a rebel company of rangers one of whom is a sergeant. What shall be done with them?

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. P. CARTER,

Acting Brigadier-General, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, [December] 5, 1861.

General D. C. BUELL.

MY DEAR BUELL: I have only time before the mail closes to acknowledge yours of the 30th. * * * Let me again urge the necessity of sending something into East Tennessee as promptly as possible. Our friends there have thrown their all into the scale and we must not desert them. I tell the East Tennessee men here to rest quiet that you will take care of them and will never desert them.

* * * * * * *

In haste, truly, your friend,

McCLELLAN.

WASHINGTON, December 7, 1861.

General D. C. BUELL:

We have just had interviews with the President and General McClellan and find they concur fully with us in respect to the East Tennessee
