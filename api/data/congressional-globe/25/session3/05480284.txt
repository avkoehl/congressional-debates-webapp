Maine Boundary Question—Mr. Adams.
Ho. of Rí,ps.
other having the same conclusion, that this ques-
tion is to be settled by force, and not by hasten-
ing a little the languid course of Spanish nego
tiation, or, according to an old Roman proverb,
putting it off to what was by them called the
Greek Calends Spam never settled anything by
negotiation " JUi venga la muerte de Spagna
" Let my death come from Spam, for then it will
be long enough "* I, for one, am not disposed
either to endure experiments, or to submit for
any great length of time topi otract the settlement
of the matter by negotiation And there, I hope,
is the moral lesson which will be learned by both
Governments—that it is time to bring this nego-
tiation to a close, and I shall Tote for this bill,
for every provision and eveiy word of it, unless
some objection should be raised of which I am
not at piesent awaie I shall vote for it asan
additional notification which I hope will be ac
companied, fiom the Rritish Minister here, with
an accountof the proceedings of this House, like
that which the gentleman from Maryland [Mr
Kennkdy] read for our information yesterday I
hope that Lord Palmerston will have an oppor-
tunity of reading what was said yestciday and
to day, and what will be done to day, as accu
lately as the Duke of Wellington had of a much
less agieeable debate that we had heie three or
four yeais aero, in which I took no part, but in
which vou, Mr Chairman, took a distinguished
pait 1 say that I shall vote foi tins bill to meet
the contingency heie contemplated, if it shall
come, as we may hear to morrow or the next day,
nnd this oeing the last day we have Itft, we must
corat to some determination, we must make some
provision fot this time of difficulty and dangei
I shall vote foi this bill, therefore, not because it
is piobably the best that could be passed, if we
liad tinu to discuss the whole subject, but because
it puts us in a state of defense     It is arming
Then is no kind of pietcnsion that this is a war
bill—it is aiming—it is defense, from beginning
to end—the defense of our territory—the d< fense
of our soil Theie is nothing in the slightest
degiee offensive in it, and theiefoie my eais aie
latlm deaf to any intimation as to what this <n< at
nation may think of us if we do pass this bill—
how she may take offense I \t ly nidcpe ncli nt
nation upon earth has the light to aim, without
giving off use to any otlu r nation All that any
uthe i natie n has a light to inquire of anotlur
nation aiming heise If up to tin teeth is why' for
whit pin pose' Is it o(Ti nsivi to In i > It is the
right of a n i^hboi ing nation to put this qui stion,
andiftheaiiswe i is,weaieaiiningm sell def i se,
the othei paity has not a right to say a word
The right to arm in self defense is a ughtof peace,
and is the best of all prescivamcs of peace, as
has been wild by others heie, and as is know  to
every man having any acquaint incc with the iela
tuina of pern e and w u bctwee n n itions So far
fiom this being an offensive measuie, it is, as
another gentleman has remarked, an explicit offer
of the olive blanch It authonzes the Piesident
1i send a special minister to England Now if I
were to make any obyction to any pait of the
bill, it would be to this 1 am disposed to take
rather a suffer tone, and to say let England send
hei special mmistei here, still I do not say that
I  oppose tht pioposition Cut I do say that if I
were at (Ik head of affans, I would not do this
thing It is a quairel of England's own seeking
or oí her officei's Let her disavow his act—
th re is no occasion to send a special minister for
that The minister resident theie is quite com-
petent to put that question to the Biitish Govern-
ment Still, Uowevci, the tone of peace is very
pioper to be indulged m upon all occasions,
wherever it can consistently, and I therefme shall
not oppose this particular piovision, though I
II peat, that if I were to Oppose any part of the
bill it would be this As to the arming part, I
11 all go so fir as the bill goes, or so fai as it is
t le intention of the chairman of the Committee
on ron gn Affnrs to propose
lira' apo'<,ize fn the extremely desultory
i a ie i f the otservations I have made, or may
liel befoie I r-^umc my seat, foi, in reality,
t  e    ptct of this question has so changed, <"nm

hour to hour, that I have not had time to arrange
the ideas I would present to the committee I
must theiefore say what I do say in the most
desultory manner I had not intended to have
said a word, and should not have done so but for
the argument which we have had here upon this
floor And, sir, I regret to say (although I have
no wish to find fault with the Administration)
that, even in the letter fiom Mr Forsyth to Mr
Pox, it is stated, in terms, that the Piesident re-
grets that Maine should have taken the stand she
has done It is true the expression is so couched
that it may be explained away to the State of
Maine in a satisfactory manner The President
says he íegiets that Manic felt compelled to resort
to these measures I regret that the expression
is there, and I hope that it does not indicate, on
the part of the Administration, the slightest in-
tention of deserting Maine in any point or tittle
of this controversy I take this occasion to say
(and this is the principal ground on which I have
said anything) that I, foi one, instead of regret
ting that Maine has taken this stand, admire and
revere her for having done so If she had any
sense of self respect, she could not have done
otherwise if she had any sense ot hei own right
she could have taken no other ground And, sir,
that ground has been deliberate! y taken—it is not
now taken for thp fiist lime The piesent Gov
ernor of Maine has been made resoonsible, but
I do not hold him as the fiist who has taken this
ground It was taken by the last Goveinor last
year, and if political consideiationsare to be suf
iered to come at all into this discussion, the Gov
ernor of Maine of the last year and the Governor
of the piesent aie of different politics I speak
of your internal, infcrioi, little politics, as com-
pared with the politics of the great world of man-
kind, to which this subject belongs If I under-
stand rightly, every step which has been taken
by Mame has been taken by the unanimous vote
of her Legislature If this is not so, I desire
some member fiom that ¡state to correct me
Mi LVANS was understood to say (though
but imperfectly he aid by the reporter) that the
ie solution whii h gave use to this pioceedmg was
passed umimmouily in both Houses, and that
all the othe r proceedings weie, with a single ex
ception in the Senate, approved of unanimously
Mi   ADAMS    We II, sir, if theie was a single
exce ption, we may allow a little fluttenrg of the
he ait to one individual out of a large body of a
Legislature m two branehes, as to the conse
quencos which might follow their determination
and yet we may find that determination the only
one consistent with the rights and the honor of
the paity aggueved    I say that the act of Maine
was deliberate, that all she has done was delib-
e late     She has been supported by two Legisla
tures—those of the past and piesent year   What
she has done, then   has been done with delibera
Hon    7/mi is one ot 'he quaht es which belong to
fitm and consistent anion     If theie was any ex
option at all, it was hardly sufficient to piove the
uile   feu, it was that detcimination which shows
the spuit to meet an enemy, and it was thatspnit
which, while it acts, is conscious that theie is an
enemy to meet     Is that a qualification to be dis
avowed  and legictted  by the  Piesident of the
United States, oi by this Hemse '   Is it the dehb
oration with which Mame has acted, is it the film
ness which she has manifested, that is disap
proved '   To my mind, that firmness constitutes
one of the greatest commendations of hei action
What was that firmness      Why, it rcquued the
facing of a deadly enemy  atallevents ltmvolvcd
the possibility or the piobability of such an event
And it was not facing that enemy as we   if this
bill  is passed, shall show that we are willing to
face him, because how fe w of us heie have any
prospect before us of the calamities which may
befall Mame, if this deliberate valor on her pait
is followed by that which was intended '    Who
does not know that Mame heiself must suffer
thiougheveiy one of hei veins, if this thing conies
to the issue of battle ' Itis, thetcfoie,in the pros
poet of immediate teirificd inger that she has come
to this delibeiate purpose     \ndtmlherc in my
place, to declaie that this was indiscretion   tha'
it vas rashness, that it is drawn!"- us   witho it
necessity, into a wai > Let who will say so, I can
not And now, where is this indiscretion, this
rashness> What is it that Maine has said, and
followed up by a laige appropriation of hei Le-
gislature, and by a declaration of her Goveinor
that he will call forth ten thousand of hei sons to
maintain it' What, I ask, is it' It is that she
will defend her right of temtory—a right which
you, sir, and every individual here, sav is un-
questionable, that she will defend it against the
threatened militai y occupation of a foreign Power
No, sir, far fiom legietting the act of Maine, I
shall esteem her and hei people highei foi it during
the shoit remnant of my life It is the veiy act
to which 1, if I had been one of her citizens,
would have advised her to the last hour of my
existence
In addition to all its other lecommendations, I
belive that this act was absolutely npcessai y, and
necessary, if for no other reason than to do away
with that which the gentleman from Pennsylva-
nia [Mr Biddi h] has this day explained to be,
in his opinion, a delusion into which the British
Government has fallen, m consequence of our
having surrendered, or having been said by one
of the Legislatures of the States to have surren-
deied, tins question of jurisdiction The gentle
man argued that this suriendei, by the failure of
the General Government firmly to sustain our
light whenever questioned before, was equal to a
foifeituie of that light and that, I take it, is to be
the British aigument, if we aie heieaftei to have
any argument upon the subject If the British.
Government are to maintain the act of then Gov-
ernor, if they will not disavow their pretensions,
it must be on the giound that we have been so
tamely acquiescent in her usurpations for a series
of yeais, that those usurpations have now got to
be rights upon which she is determined to stand.
Now, sound logic even, in different minds, does
not always come to the same conclusion fiom the
same premises My conclusion from these prem-
ises (admitting them, to a certain extent, for I
I do not wish to look back) is, that it is incumbent
upon us to remove that delusion, to wipe it off,
to give the British Government to understand
what is the tiue state of things, to admonish them
that they must not constiue oui tame ness in limes
pa«it into an indication that she may extend hei
pretensions further, until,going fiom delusion to
delusion, she finally comes to consider that she
has an undisputed right to this territory This
expeument of the Governor of New Biunswiclc
is a great step to that further delusion into which
I wish to prevent the British Government fiom
falling, so as to send them back to the original
stage of the controveisy,and say to them, "These
expei íments prove it to be necessary that we
should settle this matter soon we desire that
theie should be no moie delusions, no moie ex-
periments "
I Sir, in my opinion, this bill is one of the best
| arguments that we can use for that purpose It
will show not only that vou do not intend to
countenance these delusions, but that you mean
to put an end to them The bill is suited not
I «lone to the extremity in which we have been
pi iced within the last few days, but to the possi-
■ billty- of any other expeument, in case any other
should be tned It is suited to the possibility
tint the British Government, countenanced by
what has been said on this floor, as they were
countenanced by what was said heie tlnee or
four yeais ago, instead of setting up the preten-
sion now acted upon, may say, " It is tiue there
never has been such juusdiction, but you, by
your acquiescence, have countenanced the idea
that theie vas, and we will cairy it through "
If gentlemen, as a substitute foi this bill, will
offer something equally firm, equally efficient,
equally good as an argument, I will take it, but
the bill, as u stands, is good enough for me If
a special mmistei is to be sent to the British Gov-
ernment, I would give him this bill at the head
I of his instructions I would tell him to make its
1 contents known m extenso, as the diploma's some-
| tunes say to send it to Lord Palmera'on, and
ask him to meditate as much about that as the
Duke of Wellington did about a dispatch from
Sn Charles Vaughan upon a debate w Inch took
phce here some jears aso
I     Mi  Chanman, I believe that I have said all I
