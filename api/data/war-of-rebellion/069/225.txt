Major-General WRIGHT,

Commanding Sixth Corps:

Your dispatches received. The bridge at Jericho is to be used by you in withdrawing, and you will guard it until you have crossed. The demonstration of the division of cavalry on our right to-day will admit of a diminution of the guard. A show of troops should be made in the place vacated by Russell.

The name Chesterfield Station is printed in the wrong place on the recent maps. It is about 3 1/2 miles north of the river, and about 2 miles from Carmel Church. Take the road that crosses the Telegraph road at Carmel Church and passes through Old Chesterfield [Court] -House.

A negro, belonging to Mr. Ben. Lowry, has just been brought in who was at Hanover Court-House day before yesterday, at Hanover Junction yesterday,and crossed Little River at Cooke's Ford,about half a mile above Owen's, last night. He says there was only cavalry at the Court-House, but that Lee's army was at the Junction, and that his lines expended from the Junction to New Market Bridge; that Breckinridge, with his force, went down the country day before yesterday from the Junction, but he could not learn where.
