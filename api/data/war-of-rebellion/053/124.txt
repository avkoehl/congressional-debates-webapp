October 6, 1863.

Captain J. MERRILL,

Chief Signal Officer:

I have the report the following observations made from Fort Wood this afternoon. A regiment of rebel infantry passed by a small white house on crest of Mission Ridge, east of Fort Wood, in direction of Rossville. A carriage, followed by a covered spring-wagon, drove up to same house, stopped for half an hour, turned around, and drove back. I also saw fire covered wagons passing up a road apparently leading over ridge in direction 55 degrees east of south.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. W. HOPKINS,

First Lieutenant and Acting Signal Officer.
