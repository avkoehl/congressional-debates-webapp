HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,New Orleans, March 20, 1865.

Colonel R. B. JONES,

Commanding U. S. Forces, Brazos Santiago:

In reply to Your communication of the 28th of February concerning the occupation of Brownsville, the commanding general directs me to state that he does not approve of the temporary occupation of that place, and that there are not forces sufficient that can at this time be spared to make a demonstration in that quarter.

Your obedient servant,

GEO. B. DRAKE,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. CAVALRY DIVISION, DIST. OF WEST TENNESSEE,Memphis, Tenn., March 20, 1865.

Major W. H. MORGAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Captain Bowman some time since proceeded to Saint Louis, intending to procure 2,500 horses for the command. He has done all that can be done, and notifies me to night that his requisition will be filled as soon as possible. Major, I am aware that the whole command is filled with plugs, and if You do not let my men rest the number will increase. The horses, considering their condition, have been overworked and need rest and care. Oblige me very much, so far as is compatible with the best interests of the public service, in relieving the cavalry for a time from such arduous duty. I judge from Captain Browman's brief note that horses may soon be expected to arrive, and, of course, Your escort will receive the first attention.

I am, major, very respectfully, Your obedient servant,

E. D. OSBAND,

Colonel Third U. S. Colored Cavalry, Commanding Cavalry Division.
