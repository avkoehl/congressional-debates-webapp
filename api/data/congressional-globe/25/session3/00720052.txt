THE CONGEESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 20,
in the powei of all the combined talents in these
Halls, howevei gieat, to mystify the subject or
hoodwink the people The y have constdcied it
wt.ll, and the elections havi announced then \et
diet, the i voice has been heaid fiom the mount-
ains to the valleys, and fiom the lakes to the
At'mtic It is tne voice of approbation If this
question could this davbe fairly submitted to the
direct action of the people, at least two thirds of
the electois in the United States would be found
in its favor And yet we aie called on to abandon
the measure on the giound that it has been con-
demned by the people, and told that it is a mere
party measuie To abandon it, sir, would be to
betiay our trusts, to betray the people, to disre-
gaid then known will, to ttample upon then
rights Yet this is the way the Senatoi invokes
us to elevate our minds above the low, selfish,
and groveling ptupises of petty

they did not touch the subject of the sub-Tieas-

between the tíoveí nment and the banks, and grew
I out of tt
,     Mr C  then refi rred to the times when these
' defalcations took place, to show that they were
I in consequence of bank connection.    He asked
the   ¡senator fiom Viiginia if the  defalcations
I which  took place  between 1830 and  1836  be-
longed to the sub Tieasuiy'    Did they not be-
long to the pet bank system ?   In that, at least,
I  the gentleman must agiee with him    The next
defalcation took place under the legislation of
I this Government, at the last session    The banks
II  themselves broke the connection, by suspending
It pay men t, and caused the disastious state of things
i that fillowed    They íesumed payment, and the
' renewal of the resolution of 1816 restoied the
connection, so that a deep connection—and he
sue! it with rcgiet—now existed between the
I Givcinment and the banks So fir fiom these
th filcations operating against the Independent
Tieasuiy, it was the stiongi st aigument n favor
of it that they h id taken ] lace He did not now
i ltui I to go fuither into this subject, but would
postpom fuither remuiks until the íepoit of the
Seen taiy of the Tieasury should be leceived
Mr  IUVES was happy to hear the  explana-
tion of ilit honorible Senatoi  fiom Smth. Caro-
liui    He thought, liowtvt i,that the defalcations
did  nit   ittitch to the system of bank deposits

Mi OUbllMAN asked the gentleman to give
way to pt i nut him to piesent to the House a ic-
jioit of Lleiltenmt Geoige N Holhns, of the
United Stites Navy, surveyor of li"-ht houses in
'In fifth light house district of the United States,

with a wewto have it punted in connection with

Mi C piesented said íepoit, uid otdei was
taken accoulmgly
|                             PETITIONS, ETC.
1     Mr ADAMS then presented the petition from
I sundi ylaboiers upon the public works in Wash-
[ ington city, praying remuneration for the loss of
time caused by the action of this House at the
I last session
Mr A said that he did not know why these
hboieis had been thus deprived of proper com-
1 pensation They were common laboiers, de-
I pendent upon their labor alone for support, and
the Commissioner of Public Ruildmgs should
have paid them e\ery cent for this lost, time
Mr A was going on to advocate the claims of
the petitioners to compensation, when
Mi CHARY called the gentleman 'o older, as
he was going on to debate the met its of the ques-
tion
Mr ADAMS said he merely made the remarks
in justice to these poor men, and would ask foi
the reading of the petition, after which he asked
that the petition be referred to the Committee on
Public Buildings, though it was his opinion the
House should now proceed to act upon the sub
jeet promptly
Mi LINCOLN said that the Committee on
Public Buildings had already instructed him to
report a joint lesolution to pay the persons al-
luded to, and the object of his colleague would
be attained by giving the dnection to the memo-
rial indicated
The memoual was accordingly referred to the
Committee on Public Buildings
Mi ADAMS piesented a petition from certain
citi?ens of New Hampshire, praying for the abo-
lition ofslaveiy in theDistnct of Columbia,&c ,
acrompimed with a request to be hoard in sup
poi' thereof in peison oi by counsel Mr A
moved that tht leave begranttd to the petitioneis
The SPEAKER lultd that the request, as well
as the balance of the memorial, fell undei the op-
ciation of Mr Atherton's fifth resolution, and
must go on the table
Mi   ADAMS took an appeal fiom this decis-
ion, and contended that theiequestof the peti-
tioneis  to   be   lieaid   was alto^ethei   a different
thing from the prayer of the body of the petition,
| and that the foimei did not come within the op-
i eiatin'i of the older leferied to    Mr  A   called
i for the yeas and nays upon the appeal, which
weie orde icd
1     Mi   CUSHMAN at first mo-ved to lay the ap
peal on the table, but it appealing to be the gen-
i cial wish on the paitof the House io take the
■ question dnectly on the appeal, he withdiew the
motion
|     Mi MERCER rematked that the petition itself
' would of couist be,oi now was, laid on the table,
and to giant leave to petitioneis to be htaid on a
mattei that the House had laid on the table would
I he a solecism
I     Mi   GARLA.ND, of Viiginia, would aUc the
gentleman if the petition itself, on which the nit-
I moiiahsts asked to be heaid.did not piay foi the
I abolition of slavery, and whethei tht gentlemen
desned that they should come hcie to advocate
that question '
