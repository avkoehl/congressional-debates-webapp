CORINTH, October 7, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Memphis:

The following is contained in a dispatch from General Sherman to General Blair:

Tell Carr to prepare the railroad from Corinth toward Jackson; that I will get A. J. Smith to put a party on division from Columbus to Jackson, the people to be held pledged for the safety of the railroad. The work of the Fifteenth Army Corps and railroad operations to be on the road east of Corinth.

I shall be glad co-operate, but do not see what troops or artificers I have to repair railroad with. I do not think the inhabitants can be held responsible for road when they cannot save themselves from being conscripted.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General.
