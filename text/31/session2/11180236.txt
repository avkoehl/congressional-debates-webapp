The Tariff Question—Mr. Harris.
Ho. of Reps.
raised to seven and a half per cent; in 1794 to ten
per cent; in 1504 to fifteen per cent, in 1812—
duty—to t\\ enty-seveii and a half per cent.;
in 1811)—except blankets, rags, and worsted or
stuff goods—twenty-five per cent; in 18124 to
thirty-three and a third per cent.; and in 1828 the
tuxes were fixed—according to price per square
yard—from forty-five to two hundred and twenty-
iive per cent.
The history of the tariff in relation to these two
great articles of consumption illustrates the whole
system. It is a succession of demands made,
and of concessions yielded by Congress to manu-
facturers. Their demand is for more taxes, higher
duties, and still higher, until the point of prohibi-
tion shall be reached. This is the real objcct, and
why not march boldly to it at once' The only
reason is, that direct "taxation would follow, and
then the deceptions and enormities of the whole
tariff system would be exposed. But for this cir-
cumstance. those who are so anxious for protec-
tion would be the open advocates for prohibition.
8urnIy, if high duties afford some protection from
foreign labor, prohibition will afford more protec-
tion. And if complete protection of this sort is
wanted, complete prohibition is wanted. As for the
justice of the thing, there is just as much in a law
of prohibition as in a tax so heavy as to amount
in effect to the same thing. The" history of the
ron and wool trade of Great Britain is replete with
proof of the evils of all legislation which inter-
feres with the ordinary and legitimate course of
trade. And all attempts to remedy such evils by
ndditional restrictions only render them worse.
And yet gentlemen seem anxious that we should
pursue a line of policy similar to hers. And as
'ireat Britain once required by law, for the " pro-
tection" of her spinners and weavers, that the
dead should be burried in woolen garments, the
gentleman from Pennsylvania would be pursuing
a similar policy by favoring a law for iron coffins
instead of deal-boards, ill which to b ry the peo-
ple.
The reference which I have made to the taxes
upon iron and woolens, shows another fact, and 1
that is, that the additional duties have been im-
posed from time to time, not at theinstance of the
laboring men employed in those branches, but at
the instance of capitalists who have made invest-
ments in their manufacture, and who desire to reap
fortunes at the expense of the country. It is with
them as it would be with importers under similar
circumstances. Coffee and tea are now admitted
free of duty. Suppose a dozen importers had as
many millions of dollars of their capital invested
hi coffee and tea, and while they have this on hand
they could, by a combination of influences, effect
the passage of a law imposing a tax of one hun-
dred per cent, on like articles subsequently entered
in tlie ports of the United States: who does not see
that the price at which these articles would reach
the people would be doubled, and that these capi-
talists would reap great fortunes ? But importers
having cargoes arriving after the passage of such
•i law, would gain nothing.*
Every gentleman recollects the accounts of for-
tunes made on various articles when the tariff of
1M2 went into effect. In the same manner, those
having capital invested in the production of iron,
would at once reap large profits by the imposition
of heavy and increased taxes upon its importation,
anil such profits would be increased by every in-
crease of taxes, until they reached a point that
would wholly exclude the foreign product. But
how much better oil' are the laborers ? They are
paid no more than the average rate of wages in
other employments; for however much may be
made by the capitalist, he will always obtain liis
Workmen at the lowest wages possible. And when
an increased cost of nil the articles which he con-
sumes, is caused by a general system of high tariff
duties, lie is worse, rather than better off, by the
"system. Let, then, no attempt be made by Con-
grebd to regulate wages. iVo regulation is within
its fiower, except it be for the worse. I dread the
day when the legislature of the country shall be so
fur interwoven with the business of men as to at-
tempt its control. When that time comes, your

Government is gone, and your Republic is at an
end.
But, sir, the Secretary of the Treasury is fear-
ful of a certain balance of trade, which, he says,
exists against us from last year, of $'26,000,000.
He apprehends, also, an "alarming balance" for
the current year. 1 have, at some labor, prepared
a table showing this " alarming balance" in each
year from 1791 to 1850, and on the Secretary's
theory, it is truly "alarming," Here is the
table:

Now, sir, on an examination of this balance
sheet for sixty years, we find "against us" (using
the language in the sense of the Secretary)
^715,652,960. It appears, also, that during the
first twenty years there was not one which did
not show an " alarming balance" against us; and
in the first entire term of thirty years there were
but two in which this "alarming balance" is nut
found against us, and those years were 1811 and
1813—years of utter confusion in commerce, grow-
ing out of war. During that term, or at least
down to 1616, we had comparative free trade, and
the balance "against us for that period was
$506,097,416. Truly, upon the theory of the
Secretary, it was a disastrous period. But take
the eight years following, and there is but one
year (1821) in which the balance does not con-
tinue against us, and that year for a comparatively
small sum. Take the sixteen year.-> of high tariff,
from 1816 to 1832, and excluding the former,
(in which the balance " against" us was jbove
<•>(>5,000,000,) and how does it stand during that
period? Why, during the whole time, we find
four, in which the balance is not " against" us,
while the aggregate balance "against" us for the
same time is §130,505,660, and this under tariffs
about as high as tariffs ever get. The Secretary
will have to devise something besides high tariffs
to prevent this balance "against" us. But what
is this, which lie terms a "balance against us?"
It is simply this: If we send abroad our products
valued by us at 4152,000,000 and receive m return
what we value at 78,000,000, he says this shows
a balance against us of ^•26,000,001"' fjo, if a
farmer sends off to Cuba a sack of corn which he
values at «.l and gets in return a sack of coffee
which he values at $20, there is a balance against
him of A19 ! The Secretary says this is •' alarm-
ing." It may be so. 1 think, however, that the
farmer would not /.now that he had much cause
for alarm, unless the Secretary should kindly in-
form him of the fact; and then no doubt he vould
be fully satisfied that the receiving what was worth
$20 in exchange for what was worth Si wan not
only " alarnmi"," but ruinous '
But, sir, this doctrine of the balance of trade
has long since been utterly exploded !>v every
eminent political economist. That distinguished
American statistician, Mr. Pitkin, says, m his
" Commerce of the United States," that "the real
gain of the United States has been nearly in jrro-
portioii as their imports have exceeded their exports."
Mr. McCullough, in his Dictionary of Com-
merce, says that "the truth is, however, that the
' theory of the balance of trade is not erroneous
' merely from the false notions which its advocates
' entertain with respect to money. It proceeds on
' radically mistaken views as to the nature of com-
' merce." Again he says: "it is plain that no
' merchant ever did or ever will export but in the
1 view of importing something more valuable in
'return; and, so far from an excess of exports
' over imports being any criteiion of an advan-
' tageous commerce, it is directly the reverse
'And the truth is, that notwithstanding all that
' has been said and written to the contrary, unless
' the value of the imports exceeded the exports,
' foreign trade could not be carried on."
These opinions are those of a political philoso-
pher who, in matters of trade, has no superior
living; and they are opinions in which every writer
of distinction, except mere partisans, entirely con-
cur. But, sir, it is needless to pursue this branch
of the inquiry further.
The Secretary says, that " a large proportion of
this balance has, doubtless, been paid by our do-
mestic stocks." jN"ow, is there not some ground
for an opinion, that the amount of State and do-
mestic stocks redeemed during the past year from
European holders, has very nearly, if not quite,
equalled the amount sold to them in the same pe-
riod ? I have not data to form an accurate opin-
ion, but it is certain that while in the last four
years the balance has been against us of about
§413,000,000, the State indebtedness alone has de-
creased some. $15,000,000.
To understand this paying for goods m domes-
tic stocks, I have prepared another table:

Now observe the countries from which these ex-
cesses of importations come. Are France, Spain.
Brazil, China, Turkey, and Hayti the countries* to
which our domestic stocks are taken in exchange
tor goods' It need not he answered that the
.stocky are exchanged in England for bills which
are converted into goods in other markets, and
that the proceeds of these stocks do not neces-
sarily come troin the place m which they are hy-
pothecated. An examination of the table will*
dispel any such &upposition. Duting the specula-
tions trom 163G to 1840. such transaction# did
occur to sonuv extent; but an examination of th?
figures lor those years show a different result from
th* present. But suppose our domestic stock?-
were sent abroad for goods, is it the business of
this Government to interfere with the private deal-
ings of its citizens - Those citizens are quite com-
petent to manage their own concerns; and if they
are trading on a bad system, they will correct it
without your interference. Give them freedom of
commerce, and they will discard the system of
credits. "Pay as you go" would be a maxim for
the government of commercial men, as it should
be for the crnment of men in every station in
life.
The Secretary ^f the Treasury also expr^^es
great alarm, lest there should be overtrading: In
