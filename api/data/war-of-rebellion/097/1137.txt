Colonel SUMNER,

Commanding, &amp;c., Fredericksburg:

COLONEL: When passing Spotsylvania Court-House, it was learned that a large number of bodies of our troops, killed there about a year since, were still unburied, and General Sherman made an agreement with a Mr. Sanford, a citizen there, to make a proper interment of the bodies, and gave an order on our commissaries for three barrels flour and two barrels pork, as payment to Mr. Sanford for his work. It seems, however, that the commissary had not supplies, more than also lately needed to make our march, and could not recall the stores from the troops. General Sherman advises you to make a similar agreement with Mr. Sanford, who will convey this to you, and is anxious to fulfill his agreement.

I am, with respect,

L. M. DAYTON,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
