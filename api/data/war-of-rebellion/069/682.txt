HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 7, 1864. (Received 11.20 a.m.)

General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

I hope we will not need Warren's divisions. Would it not be well to let a part of Ayres' division take the position in advance of Allen's Mill, and send only one division subject to our call? My brigade has started but can be recalled. One of Warren's regiments is already in that position.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 7, 1864-11.45 a.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE,Commanding Ninth Army Corps:

The commanding general considers it necessary to hold General Warren's command in reserve. They should not be called upon for support until it is absolutely necessary to prevent your being driven out of your works. Warren's regiment at Allen's Mill should be relieved by your troops.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 7, 1864-1.45 p.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

A sketch of the Matadequin has just been shown me which differs entirely from the photographic sketch furnished me, upon which I marked the two crossings of the Matadequin to be occupied by troops and sent it to you. If the sketch just shown me is right there is no crossing between the crossing near Allen's Mill and your left to be held by troops, and besides the force near Allen's Mill should be on the east side the road.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 7, 1864-4.30 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy in considerable force made a sudden attack on the right of my advance division on a crest which they had taken, and were fortifying, and drove my men away after a sharp fight. The attack was made at 3.30 p.m. General Potter, commanding the division, is endeavoring to retake the position.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
