made under the flank fire of the monitors, to Battery Wagner, where our troops were formed to resist farther advance, and the guns of which opened on the pursuing enemy. Fort Sumter and Battery Gregg also opened fire and put a stop to their proceedings for the day.

In the evening, Battery Wagner was re-enforced by Colonel [C. H.] Olmstead's command of Georgia troops* and the garrison kept on the alert for defending it against an attack. This occurred at dawn on the 11th, when the enemy advanced upon the work in two columns and made a desperate assault, which was gallantly and decidedly repulsed, with a loss to the enemy which may safely be estimated at over 800 men. Our burying parties interred over 100 inside of our lines, and 130 were taken prisoners.

Our loss was 1 officer and 5 privates killed, and 1 officer and 5 privates wounded.

The enemy on land remained comparatively quiet during the day, being engaged burying his dead and strengthening his position. Three monitors and three wooden gunboats engaged and bombarded the fort.

On the 12th, Brigadier-General Hagood took command of the positions on James Island. Brigadier-General Taliaferro was assigned [July 13] to the command of the works on Morris Island. The armament of the fort was increased by four 12-pounder howitzers, under Captain [W. L.] De Pass and Lieutenant [T. D.] Waties, and two 32-pounder carronades on siege carriages. The enemy's shot took effect on the steam scow Manigault, lying at a partially constructed battery at Vincent's Creek, disabling the scow and scattering the workmen. Battery Wagner was shelled by the enemy's fleet continuously during the day. One monitor took a position to the northward, apparently to enfilade the rear of the work. Lieutenant-Colonel Yates ordered Battery Gregg to open rapidly, which it did, driving the monitor off, apparently severely injured, as she transferred her crew at once to one of the gunboats.

On the 13th, under the able supervision of Brigadier-General Taliaferro, continued preparations were made against a renewed attack. The Twenty-first South Carolina Volunteers and two companies of the First South Carolina Artillery were relieved by the Fifty-first North Carolina and a detachment of Georgia artillery, under Captain [James T.] Buckner. The land operations of the enemy consisted in erecting batteries and protections, in which they were interrupted by the fire from Fort Sumter and Battery Gregg. The gunboats and monitors kept up a continued shelling throughout the day with but slight intermission, when they had suffered from the fire of the sea fronts of Wagner and Gregg. In the evening the enemy succeeded in setting fire to the wreck of the steam scow Manigault, in Vincent's Creek.

On the 14th, two regiments, under Brigadier-General A. H. Colquitt, arrived, which were sent to James Island to re-enforce Brigadier-General Hagood's command. Brigadier-General Clingman's command, consisting of the Eighth, Thirty-first, Fifty-first and Sixty-first North Carolina Regiments, had arrived the previous day, and, with the exception of the Fifty-first, were stationed on James Island. The enemy's wooden gunboats shelled Battery Wagner during the day at long range. During the night, Brigadier-General Taliaferro threw out a party, 150 strong, under Major [James H.]
