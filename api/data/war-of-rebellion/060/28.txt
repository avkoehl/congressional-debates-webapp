HEADQUARTERS NAVAL BRIGADE,Norfolk, Va., January 26, 1864.

GENERAL: Owing to the haste with which my report of the expedition of the 25th instant was made, and the fact that the contrabands were counted on board the vessels at night, the return was incorrect. Instead of 99, the list of men, women, and children amounts to 137. The following property was likewise captured; Four horses, 3 mules, 2 telescopes, 2 pieces of duck, 5 carbines, 5 carbine cartridge-boxes and belts, 2 old muskets, and 1 old cavalry pistol.

Captain McLaughlin reports this morning that 1 of the privates of his company, Thirteenth New York Artillery, is missing. The loss of this man was no doubt caused by his being intoxicated, as every precaution was taken to prevent any of the expedition being left.

The sloop and schooner mentioned in my official report as having been captured are now lying at anchor off this place, with prize crews on board, and await your orders as to what disposition shall be made of them.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHARLES K. GRAHAM,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major General BENJAMIN F. BUTLER,

Commanding Department of Virginia and North Carolina.
