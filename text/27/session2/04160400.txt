ships had cost, in round sums, eleven hundred thousand dol-

So the bill was passed
The SPEAKER announced the unfinished business of yes
terday to be  the bill to  authorize  the  confiirnaUon of cei
tarn land titles to land in Louisiana, and to allow pateits to
Issue theiefur
On the suggestion of Mr MARSHALL of Kentucky, and by
general consent, the further consideration of the bill was r ost
ponad un il to morrow
Mr MILTON BROWN saii he rosQ to whithe understood
to be a mattei of personal privilege    Jle had received a letter
from a highly respectable  gentli man and constituent, dated
March 24,1842, an extract from which he desired to read
The extract was read as follow 
"I see from the papers that you have been making a re
trenchment and reform speech In the next place I see that
Mr Brown of Pennsylvania has clnrged you with stealing some
paper, ¿cc towards the clo^e of the last session of Congress,
and thai, you have not noticed the charge Your enemies are
using this to your prejudice, and it is necessary you should le
pel U I have been kept pretty busy defend n? you from the
charge of larceny evei since Btown's speech m ide its ap
pearance The papers are making a fuss about it as Well as
t le people, and siymg that Brown made the charge before you
concluded your speech, andtaatyoudidnotaoswer it,"&c
Sir, this commun canon, cmung as it does from a gentleman
of high standing and a personal friend, is my apology for
no icing in a public maimer a matter which would otherwise,
on this floor, where tie facts are known, deserve and receive
from me nothing but contempt A brief explanation is neces
saryto a light understanding oí the situation m which I am
placed
On the 17th of Febiuarylmade some remarks on the rep trt
of the Committee on Retrenchment and the morning hour ex
ptrwg, I held the fío n lor the next morning On the meeting oí
the House m the morning a severe cold and hoai^eness i en ¡< r
ed me unfit to go on, and, by the I mdness and conrfesy of the
House, the subject was agam ros poned un il the ensuing
morning I ie ired to my lodging on acfountof my indisposi
tion, but returned during the piosress of the day On my re
turn to the House my coileague[\tr C H Williams} infirm
ed me that the gei tleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr Charles
Brown ] in a speech lit, had been mating on th* appropna ion
bill whicfc was up for di cushion had ma ie some illiber-d al
lusions to me, but, at the s^me n ne, (as he now authorize
me te say,) eave it as his dect el opinion tha* neithei the
speaker noi his reauilsfteie wn by f no ice I aleo con
guluMmv colleague [Mr Car*thfí3 1 who concurred m the
belief thu the ¡í ¡oer i ai uai m to me J id received asuffi
cíent leb ike 1i thi h >nt t «tnl f >r íiible m¡ uKes of tí e
House, and that no *p cialnifupoi fhem was neces-,ary I
]o ked into the papei1? of to" next morning, m 1 found a report
of this speech otthe gentleman turn Pennsylvania m the In
telllgencer, m winch no aUu ion waa made to me of an objec
tionable kind This speech I now have befo e me I also
looked into the Globe, and iouud ro*thir¿g objectionable there
My conclusion was, that the Rcpoiters, in the exercise of good
taste  and out of respect to the dignity aid honor of the House,
had let this part of the honorable member's speech fall anno 
ticed.
Myhonnrab'e friend from VngiDnfMi Summers] will re
collect thai, just as I was about resuming my remaikson the
repoi t of the retrenchment committee, he inquired if I designed
noticing the allusion to me by the gentU man from Pennsyiva
ma, made on a former dav I replied that the papers had pub
hshed nothing on the subject, that 1 had not heaitl his remarks,
and did not know their precise import, and that my colleagues
had advibed me to pay no attention to them My friend Jrom
Virginia, as he will recollect, entirely concurred in the pro-
priety oí this course This explains why I then gave thi3 affair
no attention Since then I have scarcely thought of it; nor had
I, until the receipt of this letter, any intimation that theobjec
lionable parts of the speech of the gentleman from Pennsylva
ma had iound their way into print, or had attr-'C'ed any fur
ther attention trom either my-fiierds oi my enemies The re
ceipt of this letter waked me up to astonishment, and, calling
to my assistance one of my colleagues, we forthwith com
menccd turmna over files oí papéis to find in what new drets
the accomplished gemus of the author had fi ted up this nota
b'e  peech In the G'obe, published on the night of thc21^t of
February, we found H In thi-* most extraordinary production,
wutten out a<* I suppose, by the author, the following passage
is found, which I have drawn bUck lines around and send to
the Clerk to be read    1 he passage was read, as follows
"He was speaking, Mr B said, of the la-,t Congiess, each
individual and both paities being responsible I,et any Whig
member of the la&t Congress rise m his place and say he has
not taken his full share lie would mention an mcideot that
cdme within his notice at the extra session He found at his
room, a day or twe before the end of the session, a ream of
note paper a ream of letter, and a ream of foolscap, with a
quantity of quills, wafer*, seabn  wax, sand, &c that had been
left there by one of the messengers of the House He w^s sur
puse 1 to find that all this sta ionery had been piovided for
him, but lo and behold' on the m^t day the messenger called
and took it away he was notthe btown oí the right color for
which that liberal supply was intended
' Mr J Brown of Pennsylvania here rce, and asked Mr B
what Gentleman he referred to
* He referred Mi B to hib worthy namesake from Tennessee,
[Milton Brown ] who gave them such an excellent lectine
yesterday on economy, i etrenchment and reform This was
nothing he presumed, derogatory to any genUeman'a charac
ter It was common, he supposed, ana no individual would be
considered blamable foi it *
Now, sir, the insidious object of this allusion to me is ts make
iheimpression that while I was uigmg retrenebmen and re
foim on odiers, I was myself guilty of making extiavagant, if
not disht nDst, appiopriations of stationery to my own use
This charge, whether designed to be maiie directly or by in
smuation, to use no strongei language, is mean, malicious, and
wholly unfounded.
A'though it is mortifying and humil ating to an honest and
honorable [ ude of character, conscious of elevated motives
and integrity oí purpose to defend itself against so low and
contemptible a charge, I have consented to look up the proufs,
the best the «ature of the case will admit of, to vindicate my
self from his foul aspersion The worthy postmaster of this
House who is now did was at the extra session, the keeper
and   difttubutor of  tne stationeiy, wntes me   the foliown g
letter
"Post Office House o1- Representatives,

"Sir In reply to your irquines of yes'erda), a* tc the quan

each member was not m force at that time that the ex^ct
amount Í received might be seen That rule will have (as this
case stuking'y illustrates) at least one good effect—it will save
the character of honest and honoi able members
Bu1, su, let my account stand at the extreme limit of fifteen
dollars, and then it will appear that, at tta extra session^ when
there was no law fixing the amount of stationery, I received over
25 per cent less than lam now entitled to during the same pe-
riod of service under the fixed tiw of this House—passed, as it
was, after having been denounced as burnishing a niggardly al-
lowance.
But comparen with the average amount received duune the
same period of service by membei s tluni g the two hc-r Demo-
cralic Congresses, andit^wiil be found that I did no* receive
over one sixth of a fair Democi atic dn won
But, sir, while ihese facts so fully vindicate me, where do they

take is taken to his This circumstame is seized uppn and

rately revised and published in an mtidious form, designed to

'here was llaream ofnotepaper} areata ofltttci, and a ream

sand, §c'37 By the "and so forth," I suppose he means 'other
articles too tedious to mention," as a merchant would say when
he designs to mak<* ti e impression that he has a prouigioua
stock of goods on hand

sir, I might refer to other considerations, drawn fnmthe

out violating any rule oí parliamentary propriety I hope I
have done so, and I hope the duty of defending myself against

Mr CHARLES BROWN said he regretted extremely that
the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr Milton Brown] had taken
the course he had in relation to the mattei, and had thought pro-
per to bring it thus before the House If he had done the gen
tleman any wrons, itwould have given him (Mi C B ) the
greatest pleasure to have acknowledged it, and to the utmost of
his power have atoned for it II the gentleman had m any way
intimated to him that he had n isrepresented him, and could
have assured him of it, or have laised a reasonable doubt m his
mind as to the facts stated, be would have found him not only
willing, but anxious to do him the most ample justice He
would even have gone further Not intending m the least to
injure the gentleman from Tenne=see, if that gentleman had
given him to undeibtdnd that the iemarks were likely to have
an injurious effect, he would have aone as far a& he could
ha*e gone with propriety, to have leheved the gentleman from
their consequences But the gentleman b?i not thought pi oper,
though they were on friendly terms, to intimate to him that he
baldone mm injustice, had not mentioned the ma ter to him
fiom the day n took place nti' the present, and had then
thought pioper to bung ubefoie the House Indisposed as he
(Mr C B ) was to bring any personal matter before the Houser
he had nothine left but to meet it in he way the gentleman
had sousht The remaiks of the gentleman from Tennessee
forced upon him the necetsit) of a reply, which he would
.make as brief as possiole So lar as'he gentleman's remarks
were made to exculpate or palliate ti e charge  made against
him by his con-t tuents he (Mr O B ) had nothing to do with
them, but m that where they were made to deny or disprove
what he had stated in the speech alluded to, he felt bound
to say again that all he had then alleged was substantially
true
The gentleman would induce the belief that the remarks had
been written out subsequently to their delivery, and had not
been made m the House If he would look at the newspaper
he would see they were in their regular p ace in the daily pro
ceedmgs And all he had to do with the matter referred to by
the gentleman was, upon it being shown him by the Reporter,
to add to it that part which takes fiom the gentleman any blame
m the matter This he had done, so that it might not wound
the feelings or irjure the gentleman from Tennessee
The gei tleman wol Id also induce the belief that he was not its
the House when the remarks alluded to were made This could
not beso, for the gentleman would recollect he cal ed on him
(Mr C B) immediately after they were made and asked him
to make an explanation He had lequested h m to eay that he
[Mr M Brow* ] had not taken home -my of the articles that he
(Mr C B )had mtntioi ed as havmf come to his room by
mistake, and wh ch weie mtei Jed or the suMleman from Ten
nes^ee Ready a* he then w a-, aid «Uwij1* had been, todo
justice to that gentleman or any other, ¿it immediately ro*e in
his place, asthe gentleman and the House wmld recollect, and
stated that 'the gentleman from lenrcspce denned him to say
to the House that he had not taken ai y of the articles home for
his own use" And he then ha i furtíi^i si J ¡hat he had not
