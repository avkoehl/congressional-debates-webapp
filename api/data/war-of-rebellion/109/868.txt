Also, 15,000 troops were on their way from Grant's western army for the Army of the Potomac. The above 12,000 men from Grant's western army were known to have passed over the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, including some regiments of Maryland and Tennessee troops, known to have been at Chickamauga.

Mr. ---- learned that 40,000 troops had arrived at Fortress Monroe from Charleston, Mobile, and the Atlantic Gulf coast; also that Grant was receiving positively re-enforcements from the Army of the Southwest, but could not learn the exact number.
