CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.1
teita n different opim i s as to the principles upon
which that policy is to be sustained
I will reiarn to the argument of the honorable
chairman, and see if there b<?, in effect < r in prin-
ciple, any essential difference between the distin-
guished gentlemen The honorable cheirman,as
we have seen, says Congress can lay and collect
taxes, dutie , and so forth," to pay the debti and
provide for the common defence and general wel-
fare of the United States," and for no o her pur
pose, but that, tinder another clause or the Consti-
tution, all the money and property of the country,
not directly derived through the exercise of this
power "to lay and collect taxes," is within the
broad and unlimited discretion of Congress, and
may be disposed of in any manner, and for any
purpose, which shall be sanctioned by that discre-
tion. This I understood to be the ptsttion as
sumed.
The provision of the Constitution referred to and
read, was the second clause of the third section of
the fourth article of that instrument, and 15 in these
words:
'The Congress shall have power to dispose of, and make all
needful rules and regulations respecting, the teuit( ry or other
property belonging to the United fetates, and nothing in this
Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of
the United States, or of any particular State "
The power here conferred, it will be s> en, is as
broad as the terms'territory"and "property." it
is a power over "the territory or other property be
longing to the United Slates," and, whatever may
be its extent, it is precisely the same over "ihe ter-
ritory" and over "ihe other property " It would
seem, therefore, not merely the natural, but the
necessary construction of the clause, that ihe pow-
ef conferred upon Congress under it extends equal-
ly to every thing which is property and belongs to
the United States, and, consequently, to m ney be-
longing to the United Slates as well as to any other
description of property, and as well to money de
rived from "taxes, duties, imposts, and exeu.es," as
to money derived from the public lands, or from
any other source.
Yet the honorable chairman seems to suppose
that the disposition of the money derived from
"taxes" &c- is limited to the objects of expenditure
enumerated in the clause of the Consututu n grant-
ing the power "to lay and collect taxes," &c. and
that that limitation is not applicable to money or
propeity belonging to the United States, and not
being the direct proceeds of a tax or duty That
the limitation is applicable to the appropriation and
expenditure of money collected from taxes, duties,
imposts, and excise*, I fully agree with the hono-
rable chairman, and th# only difference between us
is that I consider the limnation equally applicable
to the appropriation and expend lure of II other
moneys belonging to th* United Stale , from
whatever source derived. My construc'ion of the
Constitution is, that the power of Congress to íaise
money, and its power to expend money, are pre-
cisely equal It can raise money "10 pay the deb's
and provide for the common defence and general
welfare of the United States," and for no other 00-
jects; and it can constitutionally expend m ney "to
pay the debts and provide for the common defence
and general welfare of the United Slates," and for
no other objects. This is my reading of our con-
stitutional powers in these particular 
I will put a single case to the honorab e chair
man, to test the practical operation of his doctn ie
He says Congress cannot "lay and collect taxes,
duties, imposts* and excises," and dwtnoute the
money to ihe States, because the Constitution re-
quires that the money so raised shall be applied
"to pay the debts and provide for the common de
fence and general welfare of the United States,"
but if there be money or property belong ir^ t) Ihe
Umted States not derived directly under the power
"to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, ind ex-
cises," such money or property may be, h, a law
of Congres«, distributed to the States, or disponed
of m any other manner, or for any other object
which the discretion of Congress may si Icct, be-
cause the Constitution has imposed no Inn tation
upon the appropriation and expenditure of such
money and property, but has expressly gr nted to
Congress the power "to dispose of ant' n ake all
needful rules and regulation , respecting" it    Con-
gress has, by the Constitution, the express power
"to borrow money on the credit of the United
States," and tbht without any limitation in the
clause conferring the power, as to the objects for
which the money may be borrowed. The grant of
the power is clear, distinct, and perfect; and ac-
cording to the rule of construction adopted by the
honorable chairman, is without limit, other than
the discretion of Congres*. We pass a law, then,
to borrow money, and direct the distribution to ihe
States of the money so borrowed Is there any
thing unconstitutional in this, according to the ar-
I gument of the honorable chairman? Certainly no-
thing. The money distributed is not derived un-
der the power "to lay and collect taxes," but un-
der the power "to borrow money " It is free,
therefore, from the limitations of expenditure im-
posed upon money derived from taxes, and is sub-
ject to the unlimited disposition of Congress at its
discretion. Still the money borrowed creates a
debt; and Congress is expressly authorized "to lay
and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and eMises, to
pay the deits" of the United States.
I now reach the practical argument of the
honorable chairman, and it is this Corgrea can-
not lay ar d collect taxes to obtain money foi dis-
tribution to the States, because the Constitution
limits the use and application of money so obtain
ed, but Congress can borrow money to distribute,
and ihen lay and collect taxes to pay thf debt thus
contracted
I cannot say a single othei word to make this
point of the argument more clear or palpable,
but there is another view of it which I am bound
tu take in the connect on, and it is this- Congress
cannot "lay and collect taxes, duties, impists, and
excises," and distribute the money to the States,
because the power to rare money m that way is
expressly limited "to pay the debts and provide for
the common defence and general welfare of the
United States," but when the money has been ex-
pended in building ships, forts, or other works of
defence, the limitation in the Constitution has been
fulfilled, the ships, the forts, or whitever else,
become the "property" of the country, and, upon
the principle contended for by the honorable chair-
man, are subject to any disposition which the
unlimited discretion of Congress may choose to
make of them, under the constitutional grant of
power "to dispose of and make all needfal rales
and regulations respecting the territory and other
property belonging to the Umted States " The
ships, the forls, the arms, therefore, ot the United
States, may be exposed to sale, as well as the pub-
lic lands, to raise a fund for distribution, and this
exercise of power, as well as that to borrow mo-
ney, may, according to this argument, be brought
in aid of this corrupt and corrup ing policy,
while the taxing power m 1st follow each to
make good the ruin produced, or the debt con-
tracted.
Is it possible that such is the system of Govern-
ment which our noble fathers of the Revolution,
and the sages of the Convention of 178T, intended
to bequeath to us? Did they, in our glorious Con-
stitution, intend to provide that Congress «hould
not lay taxes fir the direct benefit of the separate
States, but that the money collected from taxes
should first be converted into ships, or forts, or
arms, for the common defence, and then that those
ships, and fcrts, and arms should be again convert-
ed into money ti be distributed to the States? Did
ihey intend to deny to Congress the right to lay
and collect taxes for distribution, and expressly
grant the power "to borrow money on ihe credit of
th" United Slaies" for that purpose? Can Sena-
'ors reconcile their mmds to absurdities so mon-
strous, to sustain a policy so suicidal both to the
States and the Union?
As it is not my intention to protract this argu-
ment upon this occa«ion, I will leave it here and
turn my attention moie immediate!} to th<> amend-
ment under consideration
The proposition is to pledge the public lands to
Ihe public defences of the country, naval and
military, asasubsti'ute for a distribution of the
proceeds of the sales of those lands to the States.
Upon this subject of the public defences I desire
to glance at the past, and see what has been the
action of men and of parties in former years, and
especially when our Treasury was full Then
there was a party, a very small party it is true,
here, who sjught to crowd our defensive works,
and to sink our surplus of revenue, so far as it
cou'd be properly done, in them I was a mem-
ber of that party, and went with it Propositions
were made to this body on the subject of the forti-
fications, which called for appropriations so large
as to be branded with the charge of extravagance,
and I gave votes upon them which I presume may
have subjected me to that charge before my con-
stituents and the country. My reasons for my
course were that our defences were in a backward
sta'e, and required large expenditures, that the
country bad the money, and every interest, public
and private, called for lis expenditure, to prevent
dangerous and hurtful accumulations in the banks,
and that there was no time so favorable for the
construction of fortifications, and oth°r works of
defence, as when the Treasury was full, and the
country prosperous and at peace with all the
world.
Still this policy did not prevail, and why? Be-
cause this very policy of distribution interposed
itself It was not then termed distribution, but de-
posite, but we are now told by its then strongest
advocates that they intended it as a distribution, in
fact, and only gave it the name and form of a de-
posite to secure its success. It did succeed, and
while the appropriations of 1835-'6 for our pub'ic
defences, military and naval, were rather under
than over the general average in amounts, a law
was passed which carried from the National Trea-
sury to those of ihe States more than twenty-eight
millions of dollars, an amount more ihan sufficient
to have entirely compleled our whole system of
land defences upon a plan more extensive than
any one now thinks of adopting
This was not all. At the following session of
Congress, the usual fortification bill was entirely
sunk and lost, because it was not permitted to carry
through this body, as a rider upon it, a further pro-
vision for distribution to thp States Thuo, and
for such a reason, the entire appropriation for for-
tifications, for the sessi n of 1836->7, wholly
failed, and the present Secretary of War was the
individual whs, in the other branch of Congress,
proposed the rider, and thus caused the destruction
of the bill       
Now, when our Treasury is empty, when we are
borrowing money and imposing taxes, and when
the Republican members contend for limited ap-
propriations, this officer comes forward with his
report, recommending a larger ímm^dia e appro-
priation for fortifications, tobe made at this spe-
cia' session of Congress, than th1 average amount
heretofore annually appropriated for that object;
and, in addition to this,presses upon Congress the ne-
cessity of adopting without delay, and of vigorou ly
prosecuting a system of land defences alone, which
he says will require an expenditure of more than
twelve millions of dollars
Hence, I presume, Ihosc who shall now advocate
moderate appropriation* in this branch of expen-
diture, to keep down our debt and lighten taxation,
are to be set down as parsimonious, or indifferent
to the defence of the country, and I doubt not I
shall be one of those who will be subjected to such
charges. My course, however, has been and shall
continue to be plain and easily explained. When
ihe money was in the Treasury, I preferred ap-
propriating it to the defences, to^ivmg it away to
ihe States, and so voted Not so with those who
favored the former distribution. They withheld
the money from the defences to safe it for distribu-
tion
How will it be between the parties toxv? We
have again the same alternative presented to us
Thf b 11 pr poses to give away to lb.  States the
proceed* of ihe sales of the public lands, and the
amendment proposes to set apart, plfdge and ap-
propriate those mmejsto the public defences I
cannot hesitate in my choice, any more dan I can
(kubt as to my constitutional duty. The moneys
s re Ihe property of the Union. The Treasury of
he Union requires ihpir use It requires them to
carry on the system of defences necessary for the
safety and protection of the Union; and we   are
