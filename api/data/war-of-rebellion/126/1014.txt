The regulations framed by this office for volunteer recruiting service remained in force with but slight modifications during the war. The re-enlistment of veteran volunteers in the field and the recruitment of all colored volunteers was under the direction of the Adjutant-General.

The following statement shows the numbers recruited under his direction:

Militia (three and nine months) from April 15,

1861, to May 1, 1863............................. 195,921

Volunteers from May 3, 1861, to May 1, 1863...... 1,149,719

Veteran volunteers re-enlisted in the

field, 1863-"64.................................. *138,251

Colored troops during the war.................... 169,624

------------

Total............................................ 1,653,515

making about two-thirds of the whole number furnished during the war.

The subject of organizing volunteer troops was under the charge of the Adjutant-General throughout the war. This involved-

First. The establishing and management of the general depots or rendezvous in the several States for collecting and instructing recruits.

Second. The care of all recruits (including those enlisted under the Provost-Marshal-General's Bureau) after arrival at general depot.

Third. The organization of the recruits, if for now commands, into regiments and companies.

Fourth. The forwarding of all troops, new organizations and detachments of recruits for old ones, to the field.

Fifth. The muster in of commissioned officers and enlisted men for all organizations already in the field, and for those serving not in the field, but under the control of commanding generals of departments.

This important duty, in which many difficult questions arise, upon the solution of which depends the commencement of pay or date of rank, required at times a corps of 200 commissaries and assistant commissaries of musters, or one commissary for each military geographical division and department and each army, and one assistant for each division of troops.

Sixth. The mustering out and discharging all volunteers and military and returning them to their homes.

Table D, giving two classifications-one by States, the other by calls-shows the number of new organizations organized and forwarded to the field under direction of this office during the war.
