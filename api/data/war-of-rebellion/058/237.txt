PULASKI, TENN., January 27, 1864.

Colonel MIZNER, Columbia:

Colonel Miller had a severe fight yesterday near Florence; our loss, 15 killed, 25 wounded. Prisoners taken say Corinth has been evacuated and burned by our forces. If this is so we will have a large cavalry force then upon us. I wish you would send scouting parties 20 or 30 miles to the southwest, say on the Waynesborough pike.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

PULASKI, TENN., January 27, 1864.

Colonel GEORGE E. SPENCER, Athens:

The scouts that were out with the Eighteenth Missouri have just come in. Johnson's men followed up Miller, and some 15 of them attacked the scouts this morning at Foster's house, on Lamb's Ferry road. The scouts killed 2, 1 of whom was found. Dispatches show that Johnson has other regiments beside his own on this side of Tennessee River, though Colonel Phillips knows best what he has. It appears to me that Colonel Miller should have cleaned those men out if he had as many as they did.
