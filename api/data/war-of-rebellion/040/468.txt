GRAFTON,

May 11, 1863.

Brigadier-General ROBERTS:

Your dispatch received. The information received by your scout confirms me in the opinion that you ought to strike a prompt and vigorous blow at once before the enemy can be re-enforced, and drive him back into the mountains, where he cannot subsist. I will send the Tenth Virginia to-day to Clarksburg, with orders to follow and report to you. The Twelfth Virginia will remain at Clarksburg. You will find the Tenth Virginia a fine regiment, and Colonel Duval a gallant and reliable officer.

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General ROBERTS:

The Twelfth Virginia Infantry have just arrived, and I send them direct to Clarksburg. I suggest to you to take all of the force you have at Clarksburg now, except the Sixth Virginia, and move at once toward Weston. I will protect your supplies and rear. I expect the Tenth Virginia to-night. Nothing from Barry this morning in regard to Jones' maraud in Tyler County.

They fell back into camps from Weston; one camp at Jacksonville, 7 miles on the Bulltown road, the other about 7 miles on the Weston and Parkesburg pike.

Information seemingly reliable indicates that heavy re-enforcements (under General Floyd) are joining them from the direction of Summerville-it is thought amounting to 10,000 men.
