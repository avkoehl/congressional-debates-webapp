Weather that will enable the enemy to operate will afford us the same opportunity, and any plan which may be adopted involving Sherman and Thomas can be co-operated with from here.

A bridge-head and bridge in the neighborhood of Dallas or Igou's Ferry, with a force threatening Cleveland, would probably bring the enemy either from the front of Burnside or Thomas. If from the former he could advance at least to the line of the Hiwassee, and if the whole plan was fortunately executed, would give us all the country as far south as Cleveland, and allow a complete junction of your entire army.

The general also says, should a plan of operations of this kind be put on foot, he could use four or five thousand of Thomas' cavalry to great advantage. Or, even if it is determined to do no more than try to hold the present line of the Little Tennessee, this additional cavalry force would be of great benefit to him. He thinks it would enable him to hold his line against any ordinary force that the enemy can send against him.

The general does not wish to be understood as requesting 10,000 infantry to be sent to him, but makes this suggestion in view of the possibility that no operation toward Cleveland on the part of Thomas may be deemed practicable, and that you may still desire and make his occupancy of this country certain.
