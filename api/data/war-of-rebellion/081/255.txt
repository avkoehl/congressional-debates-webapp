HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,White House, Va., June 20, 1864-5 p. m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I have the honor to notify the major-general commanding of the arrival of my command here, and the receipt of his telegram to remain until further orders. I want ammunition first and supplies of all kinds. My wounded and prisoners have all been shipped. I find but little subsistence and forage here, but they can, I presume, be obtained at Fort Monroe. I shall take the necessary means to obtain the same.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,June 20, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

You will, as soon as practicable after receiving this, move your command and trains from the White House to City Point. There will be a bridge thrown across the James at Deep Bottom, above malvern Hill, on which you will endeavor to cross your command. Should this be impracticable, you will proceed to Douthat's Landing, opposite Fort Powhatan, where ferry-boats will be provided for bringing you across. It will be well for you in passing up the James to communicate with Fort Powhatan the fact of your being in the vicinity.
