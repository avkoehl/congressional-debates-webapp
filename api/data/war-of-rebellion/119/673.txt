STATE OF OHIO, County of Franklin, ss:

I curfewed that on this 7th day of December, 1863, personally appeared before me, Frederick J. Fay, a notary public in and for said country and State, Jesse W. Moon, who, being by me duly sworn, deposes and says that he is a sergeant of Company F of the Eighty-eighth Regiment of Ohio Volunteer Infantry; that about the 3rd or 4th day of November last past, as near as this deponent can remember, he was sent by the order of General Mason, through Major Skiles, to the Ohio penitentiary to act as steward to the rebel prisoners confined therein. Deponent had a note from General Mason to Nathaniel Merion, the warden of said penitentiary, informing said warden who he was and directing said warden to admit him. This note contained no orders or instructions as to the duty of this deponent. Deponent's instructions were received verbally from General Mason. They were as follows: That this deponent was to lock up said rebel prisoners in their cells at night and unlock said cells in the morning, to take said prisoners to their meals, and to purchase such things for them as were allowed, tobacco or stationery (for anything else an order form the surgeon, Doctor Bailey, was necessary), to see to the rations of said prisoners, and see that they drew them regularly every ten days. General Mason also directed deponent to have on eye to the guard on the outside wall of said penitentiary, that they performed their duty faithfully, although there was another sergeant of that guard, and this despondent's principal duty was the charge of the guards inside of the said penitentiary. Deponent was not instructed to sweep the cells occupied by said prisoners or to have them sweep. Said warden gave this deponent instructions when he first went to said penitentiary how to lock and unlock the cells, what articles said prisoners were allowed, and so forth. Said warden afterward form time to time cautioned this deponent to be careful. When said prisoners wanted anything not allowed by the orders, for instance, whey they wanted their clothes or boots mended, deponent was in the habit of applying to said Merion, the warden as aforesaid, for his permission. Some times said warden would give his permission, and at other times refuse it.
