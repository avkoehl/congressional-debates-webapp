PORT HUDSON, La., February 28, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Your cipher has been received. Will make the effort, but cannot succeed at present. See my telegram of yesterday on the subject. The Confederate left two field-pieces on [Indianola?]* which I suspect were blown up.

C. L. STEVENSON.
HDQRS. FIRST MIL. DIST., DEPT. MISS. AND E. La., Columbus, MISS., February 28, 1863.

General S. COOPER,Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to forward the remainder of the correspondence between Governor Moore, of Louisiana, and myself up to this date, embracing his letter of the 2nd of January, 1863, and mine in reply of the 22nd of February instant, with the request that you will lay it, in connection with my letter of the 2nd of December, 1862, to Governor Moore, already forwarded to your office on the 6th of December, +before the President for his information. It will show, I trust, that the implied disparagement of my administration of a part of the military district embracing Eastern Louisiana with which I was then charged was not only unjust but without a foundation for its inception.

I am, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

DANIEL RUGGLES.
