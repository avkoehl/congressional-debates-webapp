You will see the necessity for keeping you men well in hand, and prepared for any move, as it can hardly be presumed that the enemy in your front will again be so inactive as on the former advance of General Burnside.

General Williams has been forced back to Abingdon. The force of the enemy is variously estimated at from eight to seventeen regiments, and a battle is deemed imminent. The major-general commanding and staff let here on a special train this morning. Let me have the earliest information of affairs in your front, that I may communicate it to him.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

COLONEL: I have received your telegram of this morning, but not your letter alluded to in it. Have sent your telegram to the major-general commanding, who left here for Abingdon in a special train yesterday morning, and will forward you his answer without
