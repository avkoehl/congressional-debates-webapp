of the Navy, praying that the retired staff officeis
of the Navy may be placed on an equality in re-
gard to pay witli line officers of the same rank;
which was referred to the Committee on Naval
Affairs.
Mr. HALE. I have a petition from contract-
ors for the machinery of the side-wheel gunboats
known as "double enders," representing that the
price to be paid to them is considerably less than
the actual expenses of the work, and praying that
Congress will take such action upon their petition
that they may have the opportunity to verify the
matters and things set foith in it, and that they
may have such further relief in the premises as
shall be judged meet. I hardly know to what
committee this petition should go, but perhaps
the more appropriate reference would be to the
Committee on Naval Affairs.
The petition was referred to the Committee on
Naval Affairs.
Mr. GRIMES. I present the petition of John
L. Campbell, a citizen of the Territory of Idaho,
and formerly a citizen of llie State of Iowa, rep-
resenting that the Territory of Idaho is divided
by a range of I lie Rocky mountains which renders
one portion of the Territory inaccessible from
the other portion; that it is composed of a ter-
ritory sufficiently large to make several States as
big as New York or Pennsylvania, and he prays
that Congress may in its wisdom provide for a
division of the Territory. The petition is accom-
panied by a map. 1 move that it be referred to
the Committee on Territories.
The moiion was agreed to.
Mr. GRIMES. 1 present the petition of John
Thomas Lrtiie, who claims that In- is the discov-
erer ami piopiietor of a remedy for the preven-
tion and euie of aniall-pox. He represents that
his remedy has been submitted to various tests;
and he asks that Congress shall provide that lie
shall have an opportunity of trying it upon some
or all of ihe patients in the small-pox hospital at
Kalorama. I move that the petition and papers
accompanying it be referred to the Committee on
Military Aflaiis and the Militia.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. HARLAN. I pieseuteda few days since
resolutions of the Legislature of Iowa in favor of
an amendment to the pension laws, so as to allow
pensions to widows of chaplains and surgeons
who way die in the service. I move now that
tiiose resolutions be rel'ened to the Committee on
Pensions.
The motion was agreed to.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I desire to say few
words in explanation of some remarks that I
made here on a former occasion, by the leave of
the Senate.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator will
proceed, if there be no objection.
Mr. FESSENDEN. It may be recollected that
when the deficiency bill was before the Senate
there was a clause in it, as it came from the
House of Representatives, making an appropri-
ation to pay Little & Brown for certain volumes
of their edition of the laws, the tenth and eleventh
volumes, I think. The Committee on Finance
recommended that that clause be stricken out;
and being called on for an explanation, I gave to
the Senate the explanation that I had received at
the Department, almost in the same words, as
near as 1 could recollect them; the facts were cer-
tainly the same. That explanation which I gave
seemed to cast a reflection on the conduct of those
gentlemen, Messrs. Little & Brown, with refer-
ence to the matter. It stated substantially that
their dealings had been with a clerk of the Inte-
rior Department, and that it was a surprise on
the Department itself, and there was no occasion
to pass it, as the books wore not needed and there
was no claim on the Government with reference
tothem. 1 will not now repeat it. The remarks
were published in the Globe and came to the view
of these gentlemen. They considered them, as
they do in point of fact, as making a reflection
on them.
Mr. Little has handed me this morning a letter
addressed to myself which he desires me to ask
leave to have read in the Senate. Ho does not
consider the question of money as so important;
and I deem it due to that firm to say that it is a
firm that has always maintained the highest rep-
utation for integrity in every point of view; and
I am not surprised that they should feel somewhat
sensitive at the remarks that were made by me. 1
can only repeat what I said at the time, that 1
made the explanation as 1 received it from the
Department itself. 1 deem it due to them to have
this letter read; and I also deem it further due to
them to say that 1 consider the letter as a vindi-
cation of them with reference to the matter.
What the House may see fit to do with regard to
the particular appropriation is another question.
Should it come before the Senate again, it will be
for us perhaps to reexamine the decision to which
we came on the subject.
With tin's explanation, saying, as I feel it but
just to say, that such is the reputation of that
firm and the individuals connected with it, it is
not surprising that they should feci somewhat
hurt at anything which would tend to impeach
their high mercantile character and standing, I
desire that the letter may be read.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The letter will be
read.
The Secretary read it, as follows:
Washington, Feh uary 23,1S64.
Sir: A friend has sent to me a copy of the Daily Globe
containing the repoit 01 lemarks made by you on the 12th
| instant upon the ptopo=ition umh-r consideration by the
Senate to supply a deficiency for the purchase of tins tenth
and eleventh volumes of the Statutes at Large, published
by the. house of Little, Btown &. Co., of Boston.
Although I have not the honor of a pei&onal acquaintance
with you, I know too well your distinguished reputation
as an honorable,\)Ust, and courteous gentleman to hesitate
' for a moment in submitting to you an unequivocal &tare-#
I mont of the facts to which your remarks were directed, in
j the firm conviction that you will perceive the injustice
I which you have doneâ€”unintentionally, I am sureâ€”to my
