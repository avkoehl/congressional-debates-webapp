Numbers 3. Reports of Colonel James Washburn, One hundred and sixteenth Ohio Infantry.

MOOREFIELD, January 3, 1863.

We were attacked at this place this morning. I sent my train from Petersburg to New Creek. Can you send a force out to protect the train? All the force from Petersburg are here. The probability is that a large force of the enemy are marching on this place via Petersburg.

Mulligan has just come up. We have ten pieces of artillery now. I have just received a dispatch from Captain Keys that he was expecting an attack from the force in our rear. There is a large force in our rear upon the Wardensville road. We have scouts out in all directions; also well picketed in every direction.
