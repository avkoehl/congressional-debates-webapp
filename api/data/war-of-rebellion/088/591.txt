CITY POINT, VA., August 30, 1864.

Major General GEORGE G. MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

Your dispatch was received.* The chief engineer of the railroad will report to Major Duane this morning, and will arrange all details for the prompt construction of the road. I have asked at Washington for an increased force of trackmen and mechanics and the necessary material. The expense will not finally amount to much, as we can save the material, and I trust the work can be performed certainly during September.

RUFUS INGALLS,

Brigadier-General and Chief Quartermaster.

They report no changes in position since their troops returned from Reams' Station. They know nothing of a projected railroad from South Side to Weldon.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
