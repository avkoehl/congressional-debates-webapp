position to support you or General Humphreys, whichever may need him first; and if you require General H[umphrey]s' reserve, and he does not, they will be subject to your call. Please send to the telegraph office for the dispatch of 7.40, and you will see that it was pronounced unnecessary, because a telegram from General Humphreys (time 7.20) was not received until 7.48, and this 7.20 dispatch stated that he was about to move for the purpose desired and without any further orders. It was supposed that you had received the orders given General Humphreys last night by the general commanding, which were left with him under the misapprehension already referred to. The object is to determine what enemy is in your front and in front of General Humphreys.

Major-General WARREN:

General Humphreys has been ordered to send a division of his command to this point, a staff officer to precede it to report to you.

General MEADE:

General Crawford, with Bragg's brigade, drove back the strong picket-line just this side of the road leading from Armstrong's Mill to Dabney's. They then advanced without much opposition to near Dabney's Mill, where the fighting is again heavy. Our prisoners are from Pegram's division. I have a brigade of cavalry and Winthrop's brigade fighting down the Vaughan road, and report as much as they can do. I have sent Locke to see how things go, and call on General Humphreys for help if needed. I want to take Griffin's division toward Dabney's Mill. Fighting thus in two directions takes me from personal inspection of one of them.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Crossing of Vaughan Road, February 6, 1865-4.25 p.m.

Major-General WARREN:

Your dispatch is received. General Meade has applied for a brigade from troops near here to support Gregg. The division is ordered to you. See Dispatch of 4 p.m.
