THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 20,
Ryan was always faithful in his attachment to
the flag. Sii;, these men of wealth and posi-
tion in the South, these men of cotton and
slaves, were not doubted as to their position. ''
One word more. I see that it is nearly two
o'clock, and 1 know that I must stop at that
time; consequently 1 have only touched upon
the first question presented by the Committee
of Elections, the question of ineligibility.
When the subject comes up again I will then
consider the question of the votes. 1 am
authorized by the gentleman from Massachu-
setts, [Mr. Basks,] who I regret to see is not (
now in his seat, to say that while he wasin com-
mand of that department he was, during a
period of eighteen months, frequently at Alex-
andria, and was often the guest of Judge Ryau. 'j
He further authorizes me to say that Judge
Ryan was always understood by him and by
his neighbors, as far as he knew, to be a Union |
man. I understand also from Judge Ryan
that he has permission to refer to General
Sherman as a voucher for his loyalty. The
General is well acquainted with him, having
frequently stayed at his house. General Sher-
man was at one time a professor in the univer-
sity of which Judge Ryan was president, and
in the establishment of which he was largely
instrumental. It was in this way that the rela-
tions of General Sherman and Judge Ryan
became intimate.
This settles, I think, the question of loyalty,
the question of eligibility. Here I will leave
the case for to-day, simply asking members,
if the resolution in regard to deciding these
cases judicially be not a farce, to take up the
testimony and examine it. If after such ex-
amination they should believe the commit-
tee justified in declaring Judge Ryan to be a
disloyal man, such a conclusion will be the
result of a mental process of which I can-
not conceive. I do not refer now merely to ,
the weight of the testimony ; but I affirm that :
as affecting this question of eligibility there
is absolutely no testimony which would receive
for a moment the consideration of any impar-
tial court or jury. I am glad to have had the >
opportunity to discuss this case thus far in the !
hearing of the House ; for, whatever, may be
the decision, it is due to Judge Ryan that the
testimony should be placed in its proper light,
that he may be relieved from the aspersions
which, without evidence, without, law, without
justice, in my judgment., have been cast upon
him by the finding of the committee.
[Here the hammer fell.]
order of business.
The SPEAKER. The hour of two o'clock
having arrived, and this being the third Friday
of the month, the business now in order is such
as may be brought before the House by the
Committee for the District of Columbia.
correction of the journal.
Mr. VAN WYCK.' Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent to correct the Journal of
this House of March 21, 1870. I am incorrectly
recorded as voting in the negative on the motion
to suspend the rules in order to consider the
bill for the relief of the Sisters of our Lady of
Mercy of Charleston, South Carolina. In the
present condition of the Treasury I have be-
lieved it impolitic to make payments for losses
sustained during the war, but this case was
presented specially; and knowing, as I well did,
the great services rendered by the Sisters of
Mercy of Charleston to Union soldiersin prison
and hospital, I voted in the affirmative to grant
the relief requested ; and I ask that the Journal
may be corrected accordingly. I never give any
attention to the reading of the yeas and nays,
and not until this morning, when my attention
was for the first time called to it, did I know
that I was recorded in the negative.
The SPEAKER. The Chair hears no
objection to the making of the correction.
corcoran gallery of art.
Mr. COOK reported back from the Committee
for the District of Columbia a bill (S. No. 492)

recommendation that it pass.
The bill was read. It, proposes to create and
constitute James M. Carlisle, James C. Hall,
George W. Riggs, Anthony Hyde, James G.

cessors, a body-politic and corporate in law,

Corcoran Gallery of Art, with the usual powers
of a corporation, and to do and perform all
other acts and things necessary or appropriate
for the execution of the trusts created and con-
ferred on them in and by a certain deed from
William W. Corcoran, to them, dated the 10th
of May, 18CD, recorded on the 18th of the same
month in liber D, No. 8, folio 294, et scquitur,
one of the land records of Washington county,
District of Columbia, to which reference is '
made for greater certainty; the intent of
this charter of incorporation being that the
same shall be in execution of the trusts in
the deed declared and set forth, and not to any
other intent or purpose whatever. The Secre-
tary of War, the Secretary of the Treasury,
and the Secretary of State are also authorized

tled by them, or a majority of them, upon their
certificate and award thereof, is to be paid to
the corporation.

and used for the purposes set forth.
Mr. FINKELNBURG. I rise to a point
of order. The bill makes an appropriation,
and must have, under the rule, its first consid-
eration in the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union.
Mr. COOK. The appropriation in this bill
is only an appropriation of the rent due by the
United States for the use of this building.
Mr. FINKELNBURG. How much?
Mr. COOK. It is to be settled by the Sec-
retary who rented the building.
: Mr. FINKELNBURG. Is this subject to
! any control? The amount is not fixed. Who
| is to determine it?
i Mr. COOK. The Secretary of War, the
Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary
! of State. Mr. Corcoran gave $500,000 worth
â–  i of property for the purpose of an art gallery
' in this District.
:| Mr. FINKELNBURG. I have'called atten-
i| tion to the subject. If the House is willing I
I do not make further objection.
! The bill was ordered to a third reading; and
it was accordingly read the third time, and
passed.
Mr. COOK moved to reconsider the vote by
which the bill was passed; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
