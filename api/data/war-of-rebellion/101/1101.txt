ment. I would consider it altogether advisable to anticipate such a movement on his part by sending all the troops that could possibly be spared from this department, uniting them with all troops that could be taken from posts in Arkansas and moving against him. He is only about 120 miles southwest of Fort Smith and could easily be driven form there across Red River into Texas. Until this is done there will be a constant danger of raids into Missouri and Kansas. So long as Price remains where he is the people of Missouri and Kansas will be in a constant state of uneasiness and alarm, and so long will the demand and the clamor for troops at every small village in either State be kept up. I submit these views for your consideration. If Arkansas belonged to this command it is probable that with the force there, re-enforced by what could be sent from here, we should be strong enough to defeat any northward movement of Price. While that department remains separated from this command it will be necessary to keep my troops here and to ask for others in time to anticipate a raid.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., March 6, 1865.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff, U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to transmit inclosed a letter* from General Sanborn, commanding in Southwest Missouri, containing a report made to him by scouts whom he sent to Southern Arkansas. He vouches for the reliability of their report. As all the troops except those absolutely needed to defend the posts occupied in Arkansas have been taken by General Canby for his operations farther south, and, as is supposed, east of the Mississippi, all the rebels west of the river are released from the necessity of any defensive attitude, and will no doubt make a movement northward early in the spring. In this department there will not by June 1 be more than 3,000 or 4,000 men left, as all the rest of the troops will have been disbanded by expiration of their terms of service. A considerable force will be needed to secure Missouri and Kansas against such a movement. If any operations had been undertaken by us west of the Mississippi the troops of the rebel Trans-Mississippi Department would have been kept occupied and thus prevented from attempting such a movement; but as it is I think we may rely confidently upon such an attempt as soon as grass is sufficient for stock. By the middle of April at farthest more troops should be sent here to defeat such movement, and I trust that by that time a sufficient number can be spared from other fields. As you know, general, I am very loath to make any application for troops under present circumstances, and should certainly not do so unless I considered it my duty. As recruiting has been and is going on so rapidly and so many new regiments have been organized, I thought it likely that eight or ten of the new regiments might be sent here and drilled and brigaded. Their presence here while being fitted for service would likely have a good effect.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.
