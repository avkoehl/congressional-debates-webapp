CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr. KING «aid, that he had receive-! a letter
from an unfortunate debtor in New York in rela-
tion to the subject matltr of this bill. The laws of
New York, prior to the last session of ha Legisla-
ture, had recognised a distinction between resident
and non resident debtors The resident debtors
were exempted from imprisonment for debt m ce r-
tam cases The non resident debtors were «nil
subject to it At the last session of Ihe Legislature
of New York, the di>cnmination was repealed,
and both classes of debtors pla-ed on the same
footing. But the act of Congiess of 1839, t > abo-
lish imprisonment for deb m ceitam ca^es, having
passed before the act passed by New York last win-
ter, was not applicable to non-residents of that
State. The provisions of the present bill wojld
extend th  benefit of the law of 1839 to that da«s
of debio-s. He trusted that no objection ,voul 1
be made to its passage at once.
Mr. WALL begged leave to return his fhard s
to his honorable friend from Alabama, for bringing
this bill before the Senate at this time, and he hoped
that his motion wouid b  unanimously sustained
He fully concurred with him in the propriety, and
he might add the justice and necessity of the imme
díate action of the Senate He believed that there
would be but one opinion among Senators up >n
the merits of the bill Toe original bill was in-
tended to conform the practice of the courts of the
United Stales, m respect to the imprisonment of
the body, to that of th* several Stite^ in which
they sit. The construction which that law ha 1 re-
ceived in fho*e court , cenfned it  remedial opera-
tion to the case^ where a State h"d aboLshcd im-
prisonment for deot previous to the passage of the
law This defect m the av was presinted to ti e
notice of the Senate, at the last session by his ho-
norable friend from Mich gan, [Mr Nojivrii,]
who introduced the pre ent bill It received the
sanction of the Judiciary Comimtte, and in ed
th s body unanimously, and was sent to the H^use
of Representatives eaily during the last se sion,
where it remained unacted on at their adjourn-
ment. As soon as the committees of the Senate
were organzed at the pre ent sesión, the ame
bill was, on the motion of the --ame Senator, rt<er
red to the Committee m the Tudiciary, vhich, at
the earliest moment jractioabh, repor ed it l< the
Senate, and recomnended its pas age He had
been induced to make these re raik^ ml h" hope that
this bill might pttrart the attention of those <lse
where, who could prevent it from icmainn g
among the unfinished business of the pie ent ses-
sion
Mr NORVELL said that, in addition to the
reasons assigned by the honorab'e Senator from
Alabama [Mr Kir.c] m fivor of the imme In e
passage of this supplemental bill, he would observe,
that in one or two States, besides New York, cer-
tainly in one other, laws had been passed abolish-
ing imprisonment foi debt within their ícspectne
hmils, subsequently to the passaf  < f the act to
which the present bill was a supplement Th  citi-
zens of those States weie, therefore, by the con-
struction of the Fedeial courts, excluded from the
benefit of ihe act of Congress of 1839, conforming
the law  of the United Sta es, in reference to non-
ímpnsonment for debt, lo the laws of the several
States in force at the time of its passage His ht -
norable friend from New Jersey [Mr Wail] had
done him the justice to ascribe to him th  credit, if
it were any, of frst calling the at ennon of the Se-
nate to the defects of the ,"ct of 1839, ard of propos-
ing the remedy which the piecent bill pr sentel
He was glad that the Senator from Alabama had
thus early moved the consineration oí a bill «o hu-
mane in its objects, and coicluded by the ex-
pression of a hope that the Senate would immedi-
ately pass it and send it lo ihe otber Hous 
The bill was accordingly taken up, and consi-
dered as in commutee of the whole, and o de ed to
be engrossed for a third reading
