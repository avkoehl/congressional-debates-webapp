CAMP ON COVE CREEK, ARK.,

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that on the morning of the 7th instant we attacked the enemy's cavalry near Prairie Grove Church, supposed to be 600 strong, composed of the First Kansas and First Arkansas Regiments. Lieutenant-Colonel Young charged on the right, quartered on the left; my command penetrated the center, completely routing him, pursuing him, and keeping up a running fight for 5 miles, killing about 40, capturing about 200 prisoners, including Major Hubbard, 40 wagons, and several negroes, 200 stand of arms, and 200 horses. We also had the pleasure of recapturing Colonel Shelby and his battery of light artillery, who had been previously taken by the enemy. The wagons were loaded with boots, shoes, hats, arms, sugar, coffee, rice, flour, hams, tobacco, cigars, tents, and camp equipage.

Accompanying this you will find a list* of killed, wounded, and missing, with the other casualties of the regiment.

The officers and men, without exception, behaved most gallantly.
