Boston, September 7, 1861.

MY DEAR SIR: I replied to your favor by telegraph, but have been too busy at work in aid of troops for your movement to write a letter. I have visited General Sherman about it during the past week. We are raising five new regiments, all of which I mean Sherman shall have if you will get an order from the War Department to send them to him.

JOHN A. ANDREW.
