The Second Michigan has, since this report was written, been ordered to leave two companies to guard the ferry, and the remainder of the regiment to join its brigade.

ROBT. B. MITCHELL,Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH KENTUCKY CAVALRY, On River Bank, 1/2 Mile below Fourth Courier Post, October 1, 1863.

Major SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I am encamped on the same ground I first selected, about half a mile below where the Jasper road crosses the mountain, and near Mr. Ritchie's house. The fourth courier post is at the fork in the road-one going to Jasper over the mountain and the other by way of the river. I am on the latter, about half a mile below it. The men of my command who crossed the river and were captured went without my permission or knowledge. Last night all passed off quietly, and nothing unusual has occurred this morning.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. T. HOBLITZELL,

Lieutenant-Colonel Fifth Kentucky Cavalry.
HEADQUARTERS NINETY-SECOND ILLINOIS VOLUNTEERS, Harrison, Tenn., October 1, 1863-3 p.m.

Major WILLIAM H. SINCLAIR,Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: All quiet. It is reported on pretty good authority that the enemy have burned up all the public records at Harrison, of Hamilton County. Ergo: The enemy would not be likely to burn up the records of a country they expected permanently to hold.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SMITH D. ATKINS,

Colonel Ninety-second Illinois Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Chattanooga, Tenn., October 1, 1863-1 a.m.

Colonel McCook's division of cavalry and three regiments of infantry, with a section of artillery, have been ordered to Anderson's Cross-Roads to protect our trains in the Sequatchie Valley. General Spears' brigade is at Poe's Tavern. With the disposition of forces we hope to be able to destroy the enemy's cavalry, which have crossed the river.
