not an opportunity to answer them, by reason of
his having ro voice here
Mr MANGUM coincided with the sentiments
expresad by the gentlemen in regard to tne terms
of these memouals As legarded the reflections
upon the Serate, he would observe, that in every
nation in Christendom the Court language was
consideied the standard of nurity, and he thought
the memorialists had not departed widely fiom
the Court language here
Mr KING, of Alabama, consented to vary hi"?
motion to lav the memorials on the tab'e Hut ¡f
we wei e to sit here and receive violent abuse, and
individual Senators calumniated, we would have
but little to do Fie did not exactly understand |
the gentleman's [Mr MangimJ Court language1
Did the gentleman assimilate the abusive epitheiS
in these papers to t1 e Court language'                     |
Mi   SMITH said, it vas the undoubted light
of every American cit?en to address themselves  !
toCongiess to make krown tl eir wants, but this
right should  be e ijoyed by addressing Congiess   |
in   respectful   ^ngwe       He  was   disnosed   to
observe the same lule here which prevailed in the
courts of law     The ngnt of petitioning the courts   |
for a redress of guevances was guarantied to the '
citizen, but if he si ould addiess the chancellor in
scurrilous language, would he receive the petition
or complaint'   Certainly not    He lecollected an
instance of an application to the chancellor, and it 1
was íefelíed to the master to expunge the offen-
sive passages, and the chance'loi observed, that if I
another similar instance occuired he would inquire '
who drafteu the app cation      Mr   S   would re- |
ceive these merrouals, but would lay then on the i
table
Mi   BIBB said, the right of petition and remon   I
strance was not the right to abuse and degrade the
bxly to whom the petitions were addressed   and
it was tl e duty of the body thus íeflected on to
protect itself, and it would be wanting in  ts duty
if it failed to do it     The morals of ihe people and
a respect foi tiuih flowed, in a very considerable
degree, fiorn  the examples of those in powei   i
Examf'e was moie effectual than piecept     He
would rut like the pieachei who should say, do
as I pieach, regarded of my own conduct     He .
was disposed to adopt a m üium couise n refti- |
ence to these memorials,  he would lather refer
them to a committee,nr an officer to beapoomied,
to  strike  out  the objectionab'e  parts,   he  was
unwilling to let them lie on the table v.ith those
obnoxious words in them     And if he was at I b
erty, he would move to refer them to a committee
to expunge the objec icnable matteis
Mi POINDLXTER. said, that the right to
petition Congress wis gi.ai aimed by the Constitu-
tion, but petitions should be coached m temperate,
respectful language, and he was as readv as any
Senator to t¡ eat with disrespect an v petition couched
in vitupei \tive language, adikesseu to tills body
But in lefe ente to the memorial from I2i e, there
was some apology for the harshness of its nn
guage Tncy leMt'ecl in a remote Dait of the
country, and ief ired to a particular event, and
connected w th that, the character of the Senate
as an aristocratic body And he woulo a-k, were
we not to blame foi this in a great mejsme? We
had been told by a gentlemen here, in refeience to
this event, that the censuie of the Senate v as no
repioach and shall we, then censure the citizens
of Erie lor leixhoing tus language' let us
begin a' home, lei us begin he-e, and compel oui
own body to tieat us with piopei respec , u d th n
we womd rommand the i expect of tne people
What are the peop e to I eiieve, when they 1 eii
from a Senator on this iiooi that a re|eciim by
the Senate is the nigh road to poDu'n fav Ji> but
we weie not without a higher pre-edent A late
message froir the Piesident of the United Sta es
charges the Senate with oemg guilty of a conupt
■violation of the Constttu ion oi the Unite i St tea
Under this high sanction, then, the c tiz«ns ot Erie
are excusable foi then waimth He was vvii mg
to considei these petitions, and he was unwnlrig
to treat them with íudeness, when he considered
the sanction which they had received from the
Piesident Tneieweie petitions neie contemmg
wor^e expressions than these We could not
expect to have them just as we would wish He
v, is willing, then foi e, lo refei them they could not
ijlx   him, and he was w lling to sei d tium to the
Committee on Finance, and let them go for what
they were worth
Mr IUINGr then lenewed his motion to lay on
the table, which was agreed to
The Senate then proceeded to the special order
of the day, being Mr Cliy's resolutions, and the
íepoit of the Committee on 1 manee on the
REMOVAL OP THE DEPOSITES.
Mr W1LKINS said, on the adjournment yes-
terday, he was proceeding to ascribe the existing
distress in the community to the íesentful deport-
ment of the Bank of the United States itseK— it
was to be ascribed to measuies of the bonk inter-
vening between the íemoval of the deposites and
the piessuie 11 ere was one or two facts moie
which he would offer as evidence of this disposi-
tion And a prominent one was, theiefusal of the
baiiit to join the local banks many auangement for
the íehei of the commeicial commui uy, when the
bank well knew the Government and the Secietaiy
would have gone hand in hand with them in the
attainment ot that object Hence the State oanks
all ovei the country were m  monahz ng Congress
for the lestoration of the deposites, because the
bank was only to be thus appeased Another fact
of which theie was undeniable evidence, was, its
disposition to oppress the country by a resort, in
August last, to breaking up the domestic exchanges
between the Atlantic cities and the interioi 1 he
vast West, ard particulaily his city, at the head
of the Ohio nvei, connected with tne Mississippi,
have felt this moie sensibly than any othei naitof
thecountry This was two months anteaor to the
remova1 ot the deposites, and theiefoie that could
not have produced u Ihe bank, by meal s of its
great capital and extensive cnculat on of its notes,
had complete conuol ovei th  debts of the United
States and the domestic exchanges, and by refer-
ring to the letter of Mr Ciawfoid in 1817, it wou'd
be found tnat the conduct of the bank, whe i con
sidered according to his views, fully justified ire
Secietaiy in tut rcmovi.1 of tne deousites, if he
had had rothing else The bank at that time was
aoout to adopt a system of exchanges injurious to
the country, and Mi Crawford infoimed them
that if they did so, ihe Government had no other
alternative but to take away the public deposites
Why, then, was theie distress, unless it was
caused by the bank itself The Ute bank of Mr
Guaid went down without creating any distress,
altnough his loans amounted to four millions lie
admitted that ihe bank ought to i educe its dis
counts, because of the removal of the deposi es,
but the reduction should be proportioned to the
demand likely to be made on them But they were
dispropo tioi ed, and holding ag it did, the emue
contrwl over the cuirency, and holding ihe dis
counts of the countiy in us hands, theie was no
necessity for its pursuing such a course, and
entailirgcalan ity on the countiy Heiefeneo to
the newspapers of the day, as proving that the
íemoval was not thought ot any consequerce to
the oank
It was asked, what cou'd the bank do to leheve
tl e country ? He answered, eveiything it w is
ncli and fOweifuI,and by a single bieafh could
lestoie confidence in the cimmunity—'et it cease
any fur hei curta Iment—stind still—restoieamity
between l self anil the local banks, and the Sec
retiiy wou d go hand in hand, and do all in the
powei of tne Department to lestore confidence in
the commercial community, and dispel embar

not neai enough to justi y the removal, it has not
apj reached neai enough to justuv "-uch excessive

nineteen i nllioi s In he last month it has de
cieascd is bu^tneoo   noic than one ¡.lil'ioi, and
added half a million of specie to its vaults     In
| Pittsburg, the reduction fiom the maximum of i s
I loans, m one year, was (he spoke in round nnm-
1 bers) $557,000, and in the two last months, g?2,U00,
extoited fiom the citizens of Pi t'-burg, when the
bank was peifectly safe fiom all accident, and be-
yond the reach of the world     And in Boston, m
i the same penod, a curtailmert of $600 000 had
I taken  place      Mr   W   proceeded  to  show  the
views of Mr  Biddle as to the readiest means of
averting a panic, and contei ded that he could dis-
pel the embarrassment, and by ¡he magic of his
pen, afford lehefm a moment     Mi   W adverted
to the  House of Rer resentatives'a report of tne
spnng of  1832, page 460, to the answer of Mr
Biddle to a question pu' by Mr  McDufEe, one of
the committee of investigation
[Heie Mi W lead Mr Biddle's answer, de-
tailing the account of ti e panic in lb25 in Eng-
land, when the Dmk of England was about sus-
pending specie payments, fiom which national
calamity the cou"tiy wes orly saved by tne time-
ly arrival of 200 000 sovere gns, and the discovery,
accidentally, of a large qiumtity of one pound
notes in the vaults of the bank ]
This Mi W considered sf-ong evidence of
what the Bank of the United States could do to
give relief, and was conclusive of its ability, in
that respect, when taken in connexion with the
fact that by tn extension of discounts in New York
of $50,000, the country was saved flora a cnsisof
great dangtr and difficulty
I [Ml W heie lead Mr Biddlt's letter of in-
structions to the branch in New York at that
time ]
Why could not the bank (said Mi W ) adopt
i the same couise on the present occasion, when it
was not pressed for com when it owed nothing3
When coin was fl iwing into her vaults, why not
let it out' When "}30,0ü0 be*ore averted nn ap-
prehended calamity, why notadoptthesameeourse
now He dei led ihat there was any disorder in
the cunency, there was not a single note of any
Bink of the Uni ed States in cnculation, which
►was not as good now as when the-deposnes were
íemoved Although at a small discount, apart
fiom the vicinity of the bank issuing them, they
are all promptly paid m com on pi esentation at the*
counter, accoidmg to the premise on their face
The only real difference in them, arises from tne
expense of canying them to the bank, and pro-
curing the co n But when the period arrives when
some pay specie ard others do not, then he would
be willing to admit that the cui-ency wasdisorder-
! ed And when it is known that thecrcula'ion of
the United States Bank notes ci uld not be impair-
ed, an J couU not be checked, wher^is the disorder?
But the Secretary charges the bank with having
exercised political powei, and, if Le has sustained
the position, no one will deny that u is of itself
sufficient ground tojas ffy the removal of the de-
nos tes, for on the purity of our eleciions depends
the integi ltv of the administration of the Govern-
ment in arswei to this oojection, the duectors
expía n away 'he facts, but substantially admit
tnem And what should we think of the bank
win h would use tbQ pub'ic funds for vilifying the
public men of the country ? The evidence of the
chaige was the best evidence of which the case
was susceptible for although the benk labors to
conceal t, it admus the 'act chaigfd, but cxcu°es
itself, by saying it was for «e f defence, thus yield-
ing the point and going to the full extent of the
principle Could the same evidence be expected
as was admissib'e in a court of ) istice He was
willing to yield to them the right of a proper
e<iendituie in the publication of essays upon the
cunency md baiiiiing, and, indeed, he would say
speeches and repoits, but he would like to hear
an explanat on < f the twenty oi thirty thousand
dolíais expended'or '■niscellaneous" publications
Why conceal this, if it was or ly for self defence'
Let ihem exp'ain these expenditures for "miscel-
laneous" pubhu tions, and he would give up the
charge of meddling in the politics of the country
For if they only defend the bank, they should be
disclosed to the people He was opposed to the
restoration of the deposites, becau-ehe was unwil-
ling to yield to the bank, which, if it could foice
a lestoiation, would rule now and forever Restore
Ihe deposites and the bank will continue ns exces-
sive cartai'ments, ana how miseiahle nijstbeoui
