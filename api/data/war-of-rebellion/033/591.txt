great States is to be made dependent upon the evil machinations of such men as Lane and Jennison, Burnes and Price? God forbid it. You can assure the truly patriotic and loyal men of Kansas that no wrong shall come to them from Northern Missouri, and that no armed rebel or outlaw shall be permitted to pollute her soil by his tread if the loyal men of Northern Missouri can prevent it, which I know they can and will. You can equally admonish the people of Kansas that Burnes, Price, Anthony, and Jennison will not be permitted to determine the question who is and who is not loyal in Northern Missouri. Such a censorship will not be admitted or tolerated for a moment. I shall took to it scrupulously that no cause of grievance shall arise upon the border, and, if necessary, will do so in person. You are at liberty to use this dispatch as you may deem proper.

LEXINGTON, MO., October 2, 1863.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

Troops under command of Colonel Weer and Major Plumb are in the western portion of this district robbing the country. Will you please order General Ewing to have them immediately withdrawn, and prohibited from entering it in future?

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.

LEXINGTON, MO., October 2, 1863.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

Cannot spare any troops at present. Guerrillas plenty, and keep all our force moving to keep them quiet. Lieutenant-Colonel Crittenden is ordered to furnish you facts relative to shooting Dr. Zimmerman.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 2, 1863.

The PRESIDENT:

I find, upon full inquiry, that the report from Leavenworth, to the effect that Union families have been driven out of Missouri, is a gross misrepresentation and exaggeration. A few men who claim to be loyal, but who have been engaged in murder, robbery, and arson, have been driven out. Their leader is Joseph Barnes [Jim Burnes?], whom you pardoned at the request of Governor Gamble, and who is now trying to overthrow the State government. This Barnes [Burnes?] and others of like character manufactured the excitement in Leavenworth and the false report sent to you. It is a base attempt of my enemies to influence your action.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 2, 1863.

Major-General STEELE,

Little Rock, via Cairo:

The rebels are crossing the Arkansas River in some force between Little Rock and Fort Smith, and coming north; 1,200 passed Huntsville
