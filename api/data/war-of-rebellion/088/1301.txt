to mention the name of the officer, but assented when I told him I would substitute the "highest authority." I did this rather than nor write at all, supposing that under the circumstances you would have no difficulty in understanding who was meant. Thank God, the thing had been met, and I do not doubt greatly to your advantage, for your letters to the governor and McRae were written in a spirit of such pure, disinterested patriotism that they have had good effect. I am directed to form the reserve into brigades. I will be obliged if you will recommend to me by telegraph some good man to be appointed to command the regiment of Junior Reserves, to be made of the three battalions near Wilmington. There will be a brigade of the Juniors, all of which will be available for you.

I am, general, yours,

T. H. HOLMES.
