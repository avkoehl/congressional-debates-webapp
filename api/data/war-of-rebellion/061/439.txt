column. At 11.30 a. m., of the 22nd April, the column, after some delays resulting from the movement of trains and troops in our rear, was put in motion and the march continued in the same general direction as during the preceding day. At 3 p. m., information having been received that some cavalry of the enemy had taken position inn our advance, this regiment was deployed on each side of the pontoon, supply, and ammunition trains in rear of the brigade. The advance was continued in this order, the trains moving slowly to a point some 2 miles south of Cloutierville. The column did not move through this town, but approached it from the northeast and toward the southeastern portion of it. At 7 p. m. the column halted; this regiment was relieved from its duty as guard for the trains, and made its bivouac at 8.30 o'clock with its brigade. The distance marched was about 12 miles.

SIR: I have the honor to transmit herewith a list* of the killed, wounded, and missing, lost from this regiment in the battle of Cane River Crossing, April 23, 1864, and to submit the following report of the battle and of the marches which immediately preceded and followed it: On the 21st of April, 1864, the regiment broke camp at Grand Ecore, La., and reported, with the Third Brigade of General Emory's First Division, Nineteenth Army Corps, to General Birge. At 5 p. m. the troops moved from Grand Ecore, General Birge's command taking the advance of the infantry. The march was continued until 2.30 a. m. of the 22nd April, when the regiment bivouacked 20 miles southeast from Grand Ecore, and on the northeast shore of Cane River, which had been crossed at a point 1 mile distant from the camp. At 11 a. m. of the 22nd, the troops of General Franklin's and General Smith's commands, which had marched in the order mentioned, reached a point near the advance, and this regiment moved on. The march was continued, without obstruction from the enemy, until 7 p. m. This regiment, which had been deployed on the flanks of the pontoon, supply, and ammunition trains, to resist an anticipated attack from the enemy's cavalry, was then relieved, and made its bivouac at 10 p. m. The advance was then 3 miles south of Cloutierville, on the northeast shore of Cane River. At 6 a. m. of the 23rd, the march was resumed. At about 7 a. m. General Emory's division, which led the advance, approached the crossing and found the enemy strongly posted on the southern bank of the river. Eight pieces of artillery, well supported by infantry, held the road, while two pieces of artillery and a strong infantry support held a high bluff a short distance west of thee crossing, and commanded the field over which our advance was to be made. To turn the flank of the enemy, dislodge him, and open the road for the movements of our army, General Birge, with his command, followed by a part of the Thirteenth Crops, under General Cameron, forded Cane River 3 miles above the crossing. This regiment formed part
