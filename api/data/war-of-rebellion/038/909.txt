RICHMOND, May 23, 1863.

General PEMBERTON:

Your dispatch of 18th [19th] received. I made every effort to re-enforce you promptly, which I am grieved was not successful. Hope that General Johnston will join you with enough force to break up the investment and defeat the enemy. Sympathizing with you for the reverses sustained, I pray God may yet give success to you and the brave troops under your command.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

Major-Generals BOWEN, FORNEY, AND SMITH, Commanding:

GENERALS: I am directed by the lieutenant-general commanding to say that it was not intended to compliment General Lee's brigade to any greater extent that any of the troops engaged in the trenches. No distinction can be drawn, all the troops having behaved with the greatest gallantry.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. W. MEMMINGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
