HDQRS. DEPT. OF S. CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Camp Gardner, Fla., March 7, 1864.

Respectfully referred to the War Department for its information. Special attention is called to the communication of Colonel D. B. Harris, chief engineer of this department.

The position of Jacksonville is naturally very strong, easily made much stronger, and with the five gun-boats now in the Saint John's is susceptible of being made impregnable except by regular approaches.

CHARLESTON, S. C., March 7, 1864.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Commanding, Lake City, Fla.:

I take for granted you want river torpedoes, and will send them quickly as possible. None were ready, but will be started Wednesday at latest. The 32-pounder will be placed on car to-day, but carriage not ready for two days. Orders given to accumulate 10-inch mortar shells. All is quiet in this quarter and at Hilton Head, apparently.

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
