Can you furnish one battery with good horses, to accompany General Pickett in pursuit of the enemy to-morrow morning, in addition to the two of Johnson's battalion which he will have? General Picket will move from General Corse's position at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning, and the battery should report to him there. The whole of Sheridan's force is said to be at Bampass and about to move in the direction of Hanover Junction. It is my intention to send Pickett's division and the three batteries of artillery after him. General Fitz Lee will co-operate.
