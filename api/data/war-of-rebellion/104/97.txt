a most minute sounding for eight hours only three feet of water could be found, while the Matamoras was drawing four and a half. Major McEntee, chief quartermaster of General Steele's column, who was in charge of the boat, then proceeded on horseback to General Steele for further instructions, and I will meanwhile hold the boat with the supplies in readiness to start at a moment's notice. In my opinion, Milton, Fla., would be the proper place to land the supplies, to be transported from there by wagons, under cavalry escort, on the Milton and Pollard road, which is reported a good one, to General Steele's command.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. ASBOTH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
