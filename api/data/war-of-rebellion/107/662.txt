FRONT ROYAL, June 7, 1862.

Major-General McDOWELL,

Washington, D. c.:

Following just received from General King:

WARRENTORN, June 6, 1862.

My division arrived here this afternoon. We found no troops nor traces of any. I am assured that there have been none but straggling parties of the enemy in this region for some weeks. The town is perfectly quiet. We have means of carrying from five to six days' rations in addition to the ordinary baggage of the division. I have left one regiment at Gainesville to guard forage, subsistence, and cattle, it being the most convenient point from which to draw supplies.

I sent you by telegraph last correspondence between General Ord and myself. Everything quient here except the aforesaid general.

ED. SCHRIVER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

Have ordered Captain Shearer to defend himself at all hazards. Ordered the Sixty-sixth Ohio to move at once from Moorefield to the support of Petersburg. I have no troops here that can spared from the railroad to send to Petersburg. Can you send me two regiments and a battery from Washington or Baltimore? Trains will run down to Harper's Ferry to-morrow.
