to our front and left, where we remained encamped until 9.30 a. m., Friday morning, October 10, when, in obedience to orders, I moved my brigade out on the Oxford road, taking along a section of Powell's battery, some 4 1/2 miles, to Little Tippah Creek, the bridge over which being burned prevented my proceeding any farther. Here I halted in a drenching rain until 2 p. m., when I returned with my command to Ripley, which place I reached about 4 p. m. At Little Tippah Creek I found good water and plenty of it.

At 1 a. m. next morning commenced the march toward Corinth; reached Hatchief about dark; encamped there for the night; broke camp there this morning at 5.30 o'clock, and arrived in Corinth at sundown, and encamped where I am at present, 2 miles on the east side of the town.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,
