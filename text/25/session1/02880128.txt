25th Cong.....1st Sess.
Issue of Treasury Notes.—Mr. Branson.
H. of Reps.
these local banks had violated their charters by
refusing to redeem their notes w Uh specie, when
demanded, and yet there mav have been such a
controlling neeessity for this measure, as would
exonerate the banks from censure The commit-
tee then had reported the bill now before that body
as a measure called for bj existing cucumstances,
by the exigency of the times, a measure due to the
banks themselves, and due also to this community
But, sir, the committee felt no unkmdness towards
these banking institutions The measure they have
recommended would, if adopted, have a most salu-
tary influence He had no belief that the banks
in this District could resume specie payments,
while the banks of the surroun ting Slates con-
tinued to refuse the redemption of their paper
But If Congress should require th" banks within
thtir jurisdiction to resume soecie ¡.ayments within
a limited time, it could not foil to pioduce upon
the «hoe country a most happy and beneficial
efTc It would md ice a corresponding action m
the several Stale*, and, so far from expecting (hat
the banks will be able xuthin thirty or sixty days
to resume specie payments, be believed that the
Committee on Finance would sanction the propo-
sition foi amendment which he intended to make
He would -4. ove to strike out m the sixth line of
the first section he words "sixty days," and to
insert the words " foui months," and in. the eighth
line to strike out the word "thirty," ard insert the
word "sixty " If these amendments should be agreed
to by the Senate, the banks would have sufficient
time, it is believed, to resume specie payments, as
the section w ould then requite He was satisfied
that the hanks in this city were in as good condition
to resume specie payments as the other banking
institutions of the coiirt"y The last official re-
turns from these banks «how this, and he hid no
hesitation in saying that tho e wno had the direc-
tion of the I piiii hi tn s ci \, is far is 1 s 1 now-
ledsre extenled, were anxious to have the bam s
resume specie payments Eut it must ccm 10
every man conversant with this subject, that the
means of resuming specie payments mn t be draw a
from the debtors ot the banks For it can not be
questioned that the extent of bank credits has in-
volved the banks in. their present ca mities—and
as soon as this bank credit shall be m a measure
cancelled—as soon as the debtors of the banks
shall te able to satisfy t^eir liabilities, then will
the b inks be able to fulfil their obligations to the
peop e The fací cm not b° den ed, that ihe banks
must be able to w ill haw a portion ot iheu piper
circu alion, befoie they cin so. ely res une spe" c
payrr n's This can only be accomplished thro 1 ¡1
the agency and instrumentality of (he debtors to
these mslitut ons The banks 111 this Distnct, and

menti A- far as his own knowledge extt idea,
and he had en leavried to íeake n mseli acquainted
with the fact, these banl s have had n > connection
with the manufacture of piper money ot a less
denomination than five do lars, if they have ip-
ceived ihe bills of o hci corporations of a small
deiomuaton the fact is undemallc that the
banks themse1 ves are not justly omoxious to uie
charge of malting any such paper c nrenc)
Whether these banks en be justified in issuing
smil'bill-, he would not pieleil to sa , but the
ranks have not corsi lered therrseh es rs act ng in

something would now be done He thought the
best interests of the banks demanded it, and that
the best interests of this community demanded it,
and if no other part ot the b 11 could be acted on
for w ant of time, he trusted that the knowledge of
the present paper currency m this District would in-

REMARKS OF MR   BRONSON,
Of New Yokk,
In the House of Reptesenlalives, October 7, 1837—On
the bill to authoi ize the issuing of Treasury notes,
and on the motion of Mr Beil of Tennessee to
strike out the enacting clause of the bill
Mr BRONSON said he felt turn illmg that the
question should be taken on this motion now pend-
ing, and that the bill should finally p~s¡, from thi
House, witheut giving his views upon the measure
uider consideration, and, fiom the peculiar cha-
racter vi hich this debate had now assumed, and
particularly since the remarks of the honorable
gentleman from Tennesse, Mr Bronson said he
felt more strongly impelled to state some of the rea-
sons which would influence his vote, and which
rendered it clear to his mind that the bill under
consideration should become a law I have (said
Mr B ) regaided this measure as one peculiarly
calculated to relieve the pecuniary distresses of the
country generally and to benefit the people, as
well as to furnish immediate aid to the Tieasury,
as one which has been viewed in that hgl t by all
parties in and out of this House, and even till
within the last forty-eight h( urs, I did not consider
that there was am serious opposition to an issue of
Tieasury notes, or Government stock, in some
form On my journey to this city, I frequently
heard it suggested that such a measure x ould be
em nently calculated to give relief, and one which
Congicss should adopt by all means, if practicable,
and what is worthy of remark, these suggestions
in almost all instances,came fiom the opposition—
from the political friends of those xi no are now op-
posing this bill on this floor Alter my arrival here,
the project was frequently spoken of, and alwajs
with favor, m fact, a sentiment decidedly friendly
to the measure preva led here, so far as I heard
any expression on the subject, (w ith one or two
exceptions,) until about forty eight hours ago,
and after this bill had been some time undei
diHiissin when suddenly it seemed that new
light had breken in upon this matter Yester
d ly mornm?, Mr Speaker, we heard fiom New
York that pecie had fallen in that gicat commer-
cial mart—tint Treasury dralts were north as
much all to about 1 per cent as specie—stocks
rising and Iride apparently reí ivmg There was
also, Mr Speal er, every reason for the public then
to suppose, not only that this bill would pass, but
tha *t-e 1atx bonds xvould be extended and further
time given to the depo ne banks to pay the balan-
ces due from them as provided by the bills on
xour table Now, sir, it is a httle singular that on
fhe receipt of this news, and when it would seem
that better times were dawning upon the country,
xxhen business appeared to be reviving and when
this and other measure- recommended bv the E\e-
cutve, which it m ght he supposed would pa^s
th s House appeared to have the efiect to allav ex-
citement and restore confidence I sat it íssingUai,
sir at such a moment, that a most x gorous effort
is suddenly made to defeat this bill, and pievent
the issue or Treasuij notes, which, on all hands,
so far as I have ni> >cist< od, has been viewed ps a
mepsme so uc'l calculated for the relief of the
count! v We, haxe heard much, sir, on the sub-
ject of the Government taking care of itself without
pny care for the people The measures recom-
mended by the administration have been denoun-
ced on this floor as hax mg a single ex e to tf-at ob-
ject, and it has been made n atters of complaint
here that no measures ot relief for the people xxere
proposed This, hoxvever, has been looked upon
a« a measui e calculated to re'ieve the people as
well as the Government, as a measure that would
tnrow into circulation ten miller - of dolíais,
which would be equal 10 so much addition to the
specie capital of the country—furnishing great fa-
cilities, either as remittances or domestic exchanges
particularly to all classes of the commercial com-
munity And yet, sir, the moment ihce is a pros-
pect that this measure will be adopted, and carried
too as an administration measure, the whole oppo-
sition party aie arraigned against it, and unless I
have entirely misunderstood the scope and tenor of
this debate, their hostility to the measure, f it did
not originate on reception of the news from New
York above alluded to, it did, at least, then assume
a more vigorous, obstinate, andpoweiful shape,
so much so as to impress upon my mind most
s'rongly the belief that there w as some connection
between the cause and effect
Did gentlemen of the opposition suppose that if
this bill passed it would immediately give relief, re
store confidence, and redound to the ciedit of ihe
administration'' That such will be ihe effect to a
very gieat extent 1 have no doubt, and I had hoped
that this consideration might not be entirely oeer-
looked by the opponents of this bill—or 11 noted by
them, that it xeould not add zeal to their opposition
I hope it has not
My Speaker I have listened to the debates on
this bill, and given them all due attention, and the
various objections which have been raised n the
progress of this discussion agamstan issue of Trea-
sury notes, have received from me attentix e consi-
deration
I was in favor of the project from the first, if the
state of the Treasury was such as to warrant it, and
Ihaveheaid nothing yet which to my mind is a
sufficient objection against it Let us look for a
moment to the ground which xx e occupy m rela-
tion to this matter, and the point at which xxe have
arm ed m this discussion
Is it not, sir, a conceded point that the Treasury
is nearl} or quite exhausted—.that in a short time
it will be necessai} to r ise money, either by kan
01 otherwise, unless th" unavailable funds now in
hand can be realised2 I shall notheie go into a
review of the financial condition of the country, or
the state of ihe Treasury as exhibited by the Se-
cietary's report, or the var'ous explanations of lhat
report, which have been made on this floor I as-
sume the position that there is no money m the
Treasury, or that such will be the case very short-
ly—and that money is needed to carry on the ope-
1 aliens of the Government We are told so by the
Secretary of the Treasuiy, and by the chairman of
the Comm tteeof Ways and Means The xxbo'eof
this débale has proceeded upon that supposition,
and witn ihe except on of the 1 onoiable gentleman
from Tennessee, (Mr Bell) and perhaps ore 01
two ethers such has been al owed to be the true
-tateof the Treasury bv dll xxho have addle sed the
House on this subject 'Ihere en be no questn n
that such is the fae*, and the point that is now pre-
sented is simply, in what manner shall w e r<_plen sh
the Tieasury, I say meiely ths Treasury, and not
an exhausted or bankrupt Treasury, for, m, ve
have ample íesourees, as toon as iney can De rea
lized, xxithout resorting to taxes or dunes St is
on y nece sary to resort to somp 'emporary expe-
dient to enab e the Gov eminent to goon and to fur-
nish the Tteisury with the necessary means, wit '
the debs due to the Government, and the ample,
but at p-tsent unavai ab!e means which w e. hu\ e
can be realized w hout unnecessary d stress or
pressure upon the people
By the strong voie in this House last evening c n
the subject of selUng the United S ates Bank bonds,
it w is ui equi' ocally determined that we w ouMne t
adopt that measure We must (hen caU upoa the
deposife banks for the immediate payment of all
ba1 anees due fiom them and also open the mer-
chants lor the instant payment of he duty bonds, or
a rcsoit must be had to the issue of Treasury notes
or Goxernment stocks for a short time until those
claims can be realized Can gent'emen devise <<ny
other course1
lou have now, sir, upi 11 ye ur table a bill prst-
pon ng ihe n yment ol uuly bends nine months,
and anothei allowing time to the dcnosite banks to
pay the balances due from them, neitner of which
are y et acted upon m this House, but bo'h of  h ch,
so far as any opinion has been elicited, n eel with
universal  iavor     In  fact,  str,  I  doubt whether
