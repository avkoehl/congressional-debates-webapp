THE C0N&Kf3S$lONAL GLOBE.
Feb. &2.
The bill was then ordered to be engrossed, and
having been engrossed according to order, was
read the third time and passed.
Mr. BAYLY moved to reconsider the vote by
which the bill was passed, and to lay that motion
on the table; which latter motion was agreed to.
FORTIFICATION BILL.
On motion by Mr. BAYLY, the House then
went into Committee of the Whole on the state
of the Union, (Mr. Green, in the chair.)
Mr. BAYLY moved that the committee pro-
ceed to the consideration of the bill making ap-
propriations for certain fortifications of the United
States for the year ending the 30th June, 1852.
He desired to say, as he knew there were a num-
ber of gentlemen opposed to acting on this bill,
that if they would take it up, he would like to
submit a few remarks, and then they could vote
against the bill, if they thought proper. It was
entitled to be acted upon, and there ought to be no
difficulty in getting it up.
Mr. JONES called for tellers on the motion.
Mr. BAYLY said that he waa not ready to go
on .with any other bill.
Mr. JONES withdrew the demand for tellers;
when—
Mr. S'fEPHENS, of Georgia, renewed it, and
tellers were ordered; and the question being taken,
the motion of Mr. Batlt was agreed to—ayes 94,
noes 35.
The committee accordingly proceeded to con-
sider the fortification bill.
Mr. BAYLY. Mr. Chairman, I hard not
thought it necessary, in presenting any of the for-
mer bills to the committee, to detain the House by
making any remarks in connection with them.
But as I know there is a good deal of opposition
in the House to this bill, growing out of, what I
think, a misapprehension of its character, I feel it
my duty to submit a few remarks. Our fortifica-
tions, sir, up to this date have cost the Govern-
ment $20,525,000. This large expenditure of the
public money has nearly completed the most im-
portant of the fortifications.
Now, sir, with the exception of the fortifica-
tions in the Gulf of Mexico and at Sollers'
Point, lately begun, and a few others, the rest of
them are nearly completed. That the committee
, may see how much more money it is estimated
will be required to complete them, I have called
upon the War Department for a statement of the
amount of money expended upon each fortifica- ,
tion, and also the%mount that is estimated it will
take to complete them. And, as it will be useful
information, I beg leave to call the attention of the
committee to it, item by item, to enable them, if
they are determined to reduce the amount of ap-
propriations to these fortifications, to see where to
strike. I am of opinion, that if any of those
works are to be discontinued, it had better be
those latety begun, and continue the appropria-
tions for those which are nearly completed.

timore harbor, and the fortifications at Key West
and Garden Key.
Now, sir, all three of these fortifications, for
which a large expenditure in future will have to
be made to complete them as is estimated, have
j been authorized since I have been a member of
this House. I recollect very well the debates that
i took place in regard to them. I know that mili-
tary men recommended, in the strongest terms, the
erection of fortifications at Key West and Gar-
den Key. They satisfied nearly every member of
this House that the protection of the Gulf of Mex-
; ico, through which such an enormous proportion of
the products of the West passed, was absolutely
necessary. Gfentlemen greatly misconceive the
object of these fortifications. They seem to think
that they are designed, from the course they have
pursued here, solely to repel an assailing enemy,
• and they argue that an enemy will not attack
but will avoid them. But, sir, the great object of
these fortifications is misconceived. It is not sup-
posed that they will be attacked in time of war. I
believe that very few of them will be. We should
have strong fortresses at such places as, if not for-
tified, would give the enemy a great advantage.
For instance—to what terrors would not the city of
Baltimore have been exposed in the late war with
Great Britain, had it not been for fortifications. On
account of them General Ross was obliged to land
his army twelve miles below Baltimore, thus giving
time to the volunteers of that city to meet the Brit-
ish forces outside of it, and repulse them. If it
had not been for fortifications the enemy's ships j
would have come near enough to the city to have
bombarded and destroyed it at once, .••id as my
friend from Bftltimere [Mr. McLane] says, would
have laid it under contribution, if not have laid it
in ashes. Well, sir, the small and inefficient forti-
fication existing at that time is a remarkable in-
stance proving the great utility of fortifications,
saving, as they did the city, by compelling the
enemy to land far below, so that the patriotirTyol-
unteers could meet the enemy outside of the city
and repulse and defeat them. If it had not been
for this defence, the city of Baltimore would have
been inevitably surrendered to the British fleet.
We have constantly heard it asked in debate,
by the enemies of this bill, on previous occasions,
what good was Fort Washington in the late war
with Great Britain. It did not prevent the enemy
from burning the Capitol'? Fort Washington was
commenced in 1816, and thedisasters of the war sug-
gested the necessity of it. But in case of another
war would it be no disadvantage to the enemy to
be compelled to land far below, and give us time
to prepare for, and meet them? Would not the
exposure of the Capitol be much greater if a fleet
could sail without an obstacle up the river, and
bombard it from Greenleaf's Point?
We hear it also said, that General Scott's oper-
ations at Vera Cruz show the utter inefficiency of'
fortifications. On the contrary they show the
very reverse. But for that fortification, he would
have had no opportunity of bringing into play
that splendid military genius which alone enabled
him to take that city with so little loss of life. Is
there any one who will say that the fortification
at Vera Cruz was not regarded by all military
men as the most formidable obstacle to our con-
quering Mexico?
Mr. GORMAN, (interposing.) I have high
authority—that of all the ablest men in the service
—that the experiment of getting into Vera Cruz
was considered an exceedingly doubtful one in-
deed. '
Mr. BAYLY. I do not hesitate to say, that if
it had not been for the fortification at Vera Cruz,
the war in Mexico would not have lasted three
weeks. The operations on Scott's line were not
sooner projected and untertaken in consequence of
the insurmountable obstacle, as it was supposed
by many, in the Castle at Vera Cruz. I want no
more than any of those who are opposed to this
bill, to erect these fortifications at any other points
than such as will defend our large and leading
commercial cities, and would give shelter to our
shipping. This brings me to the second great ad-
vantage which the country derives from fortifica-
tions—the affording of shelter for our shipping.
Suppose any sudden war was to break out be-.
tween this country and Great Britain: the first no-
tice we should receive of k would be the presence
of their steamships in our waters; and in that case,
if we had no fortifications, what would become of
our shipping on the sea-board? What would be-
come of the shipping on the Chesapeake bay?
These steamships, if our shipping had no port of
refuge, would pick up our vessels as fast as the
sportsman in his skiff would the ducks which he
had shot. But, sir, with the opportunity for our
vessels to run under Old Point, they would be safe
from the navy of the world.
I have heard it said, over and over again, in these
debates heretofore, that the introduction of steam
has dispensed with the necessity of these fortifica-
tions. I know it to be the opinion of the most sci-
entific military men in the country, and it is deci-
dedly my own opinion, that, so far from its having
obviated the necessity for fortifications, it has ren-
dered them still more necessary for the protection
of ourcommerce, as I will proceed to show. When
vessels were propelled'by sails altogether, if an
enemy sent very large ships of war with their
tenders into our waters, our sailors had some
chance of escape. If our vessels were the swiftest
runners, they could escape. But with a steam
navy, not a solitary vessel could escape if '"^y
had no refuge of safety, and they would all be
picked up by the enemy. Fortifications not only give
protection to our commercial marine, but they give
great advantage to our navy in time of war. In
time of war would it not be a great advantage to
our navy to be enabled, whenever a good oppor-
tunity occurred, to strike a favorable biow ai the
enemy, and to have a harbor amply fortined where
they could ride in safety whenever taken at a
disadvantage? It would make the destruction or
