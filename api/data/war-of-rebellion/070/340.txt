MUTTONTOWN, July 8, 1864.

I will do everything in my power to get the Government horses in this vicinity, but the rebels have been above here, and I do not think there are any horses left this side of Hagerstown. I sent a party of my command to the edge of Hagerstown, who have just returned and report that the citizens say that the enemy are leaving town on the Sharpsburg road. I am just advancing on Hagerstown.

MIDDLEBURG, July 8, 1864.

I was on way to Hagerstown this morning when I met two telegraph operator that were with me at Greencastle, and have been in Hagerstown. They reported that there were only a few of the enemy in Hagerstown, but that Imboden with his entire force of about 3,000 was crossing at Cherry Run and coming in on the Clear Spring road. I sent an officer and thirty men to go to Hagerstown to send scouts out on the different roads, but before they got there a local citizen met them and told them that Imboden, his staff, and about 250 men were already in the town, and the whole command was coming in. I can see a large smoke from the town, and suppose they are burning the forage left by Captain Hopkins, and probably some of the buildings, as the large quantity of hay could hardly be burned without setting fire to some portion of the town. I shall keep my pickets well out on the roads and fall back to Greencastle.

HAGERSTOWN, July 10, 1864.

My scouts have been out this morning about six miles on the Frederick and Sharpsburg pikes and discovered no enemy, but at daylight they report having seen the light of enemy's camp-fire in sight. They were advised to go no farther by citizens, as enemy in force were below.

HAGERSTOWN, July 10, 1864.

A gentleman just from Frederick that was there during the fight reports that the rebel force there amounted to 30,000. They left in direction of Noland's Ferry, and were supposed to be crossing at that point. Some fifty dismounted cavalry of Hunter's command from Cherry Run came in this evening and are encamped here. A rebel officer told a citizen of Frederick that Morgan, with his command, and 5,000 men of Imboden's command, altogether 8,000 men, were
