HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE RAPPAHANNOCK, April 7, 1862.

Hon. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

SIR: I proceeded yesterday, in company with Brigadier-General Wadsworth, Military Governor of the District, Brigadier-General Woodbury, engineers, and Lieutenant Houston, to examine into the question of the defense, if any, required at or near Aquia, and the force to be stationed for the prevention of any attempt to again blockade the Potomac. From all the information we could obtain from officers and others, and especially from those who have just made a reconnaissance as far as Stafford Court-House, in the direction of Fredericksburg, and from some prisoners who have been captured there, the enemy has but a small force this side of the Rappahannock. The force which, shortly after the falling back of the enemy, was estimated at 30,000 is now supposed to amount to 6,000, which is behind Fredericksbhurg, with the exception of a small infantry force with an advance guard of cavalry. It will take two weeks to throw up intrenchments.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,IRVIN McDOWELL,

Major-General.
