MAY 24, 1864.

Major-General WARREN:

GENERAL: My picket-line is advancing as the enemy seems to have retired his own during the night. I send a prisoner to you who seems to give reliable information as to the numbers and composition of the enemy's forces.

Very respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

MAY 24, 1864-5.30 a.m.

General WARREN,

Commanding:

GENERAL: My line has advanced beyond the rifle-pits dug last night by the enemy. Shall I go on?

Very respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

MAY 24, 1864-7 a.m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

GENERAL: My line is a quarter of a mile beyond the railroad, on a road parallel with it. I have over 30 prisoners, among whom are a captain and lieutenant. They report that the enemy moved to our left early this morning, and that they are fortifying about 2 1/2 miles from here. Griffin cannot connect with me.

Very respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

MAY 24, 1864-7.30 a.m.

General CRAWFORD:

Never mind connection with General Griffin; move out a small detachment as far as you think it safe. Move a regiment straight along the bank of the river down stream to connect with General Hancock. It may be 2 1/2 miles off. If they should be attacked with more force than they can attend to, they can return or cross to the other side of the river. Tell the commander to be careful and not mistake our troops for the enemy when he approaches them.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, May 24, 1864-9.30 a.m.

General CRAWFORD:

Take your whole division and move down the bank of the river toward Hancock. There is some cavalry in his front at least. If
