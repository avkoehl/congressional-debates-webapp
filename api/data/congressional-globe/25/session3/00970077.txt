PCRoOIvAL EXPl VNA1ION
Mr  RIVES lose, and begged the indulgence
of the benate vvhil    he made a statement some
wl at of a peisoiial chaiaitii, with íegatd to him
Sflf, but not altosethci without lefeitnco to the
pabhe mtciest   He was not in his seat when the
ie¡ oitof tl e ^ectetar / of the Pitasiuy manswei
to the lcsolutim lite1)' submi'ted  by him, was
icad, and tin utile hid  not the oppoitumty of
commenting on it  but he Ind smci seen it in the
public p nits, and given  t a eateful peiusil    He
had seen it mo'eovei, accrmpamed  by some íe-
maiks made by aSenaioi on i ns fl oi,wno spoke
of it is a satisfactory and triumphant refutat on of
nil the charges made m the speech which pie
faced the introduction of the íesolutioi  to which
H was a reply      Now he ros" to stn e tint, not-
withstanding this c'aim on the pai t of th- Sena
toi tio n Conn etieut, that th" íepoi t was abatis
faetoi v leiutation of all the chaiges that hid been
nude ag mst the Seen tuy, he conside id the re-
port as a substantial admission of eveiything tint
hid been alleged     Indeed, if the do uments to
which it ufei cd, si ould, when hid on th u ta
bl s, eo icspond with  the descnption givtu if
them, the conduct ot theSeeietaiy will be ¡ I erj
in a moa lepiehensible hglit th m he Ind m fns,t
supposed it to bo His object now was, to state
that when the documents should be laid on their
tables, he w ould be piepared to show to the House
and to the countiy, that tiken together, the repot t
and tccoinpaiiying documents were a substantial
admission of the truth of everything he had said.
Mr KING usked if the Senator made any
proposition ?
Mr RIVES replied no He had only asked
the courtesy of the Senate to enable htm to make
this statement relative to the light m which he
viewed the repoi t of the Secietary, in consequence
of the remarks made by an honorable Senator at
the time the repoi t was read, and to which he had
not then an opportunity of replying, which had
gone forth to the world treating the report as a
triumphant vindication
Mr KING observed that theie certainly was
a gieat deal of courtesy in this body, but m thia
instance the Senator was taxing the courtesy of
the Senate a little further than usual The hon-
oi able Senator thought proper to preface the m-
ttoduction of his resolutions by remarks highly
condemnatory of the Secretary of the Tieasury;
and, though he was surpiised at it then, he was
unwilling to offer any comments that might have
a tendency to protract the debate, at a time so
unsuitable, from the absence of all information on
the subject. The honorable Senator now again
repeats his censures, when the subject was not
open foi discussion He had hoped that he would
have waited till all the information was on then-
tables, and the subject propeily befoie them.
Then a fair occasion would be offered for any
chaiges the Senator might think proper to make,
and the discussion could be openly earned on.
He regretted much to see the honorable Senator
perseveie in this couise, which had a tendency to
prejudice the public mind in advance of the evi-
dence
Mr RIVES said he would venture to assert
that the files were full of precedents fot the course
he had taken, though he had not seaiched for
them The examples were without number, in
which a gentleman, on presenting a lesolution for
liiCjUiiy, gave a detailed statement of the views
with which he offered it He did not undertake
to condemn the Secretary of the Treasury Hts
statements weie hypothetical meiely, and his ob-
ject was to obtain a moie full explanation with
regard to the connection between the Government
and the bank, and this led him incidentally into
a discussion ot some of the topics connected with
the subject What did his friend from Alabama
now find fault w th J He was charged with seek-
ing to anticijiate public opinion Now, who set
the example ' When the report was read, a mem-
ber of this body, [Mi jSiles,] who was known
to be an mdisciiminate suppoiter of this Admin-
istration, light oi wiong, gets up and deelaiea
that it was a tiiumphant lefutation of eveiy alle-
gation that had been made Now, when this vv as
dop< on one side, might he not be ptrmuted to
di ny it He meiely gave nonce of the fact that
he eonsideied these documents as substantially
dn lttmg the tiuth of eveiything he had alleged
in his speech, and that he considered them totally
in a different light fiom that in which the Senatoi
from Alabima v ewed them, and also that f the
documents shou d turn out to bo wlnt thoy pui-
pmted, he should hold himself prepaied to sus-
tain eveiy allegation he had made
Mi "NILES, after a few mtroductoi y remai ks,
