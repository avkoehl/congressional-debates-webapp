HDQRS. FIRST Brigadier, FOURTH DIV., CAVALRY CORPS,MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,

Atlanta, June 14, 1865.

Brevet Major-General WILSON,

Macon, Ga.:

I have the honor to report that Captain Johnson had issued during seven days ending Saturday, the 10th instant, about 10,000 pounds of flour. Major-General Thomas cautions me in his dispatch of May 29 against allowing the issues to assume such "extravagant extensive proportions as they frequently do." Since then I have informed you of the great number of destitute people hereabouts, and can safely say we have not supplied one-fourth of them, and then only with seven days' supplies. I send this note for your information that I may be advised if the issues are, or promise to be, too large.

Your obedient servant,

E. F. WINSLOW,

Brevet Brigadier-General.
