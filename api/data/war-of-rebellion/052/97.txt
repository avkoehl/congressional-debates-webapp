General DENNIS,

Black River Bridge:

I did intend to ride down to your camp to-day, but must go up to Oak Ridge. Watch well the health of your camps, and on the appearance of malarious disease let brigades or even divisions move. The ground north of Clear Creek, on the road from Bovina to Tiffin, appears to be healthy and suitable for camps, but as long as you are pretty well, your present camps are best placed.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

It is reported that the enemy's cavalry, 2,000 strong, are in the vicinity of Black River, with the intention of crossing at some favorable point and making a dash on our outposts and camps, should the opportunity present itself. Commanders of brigades need not communicate this to their commands until further orders.
