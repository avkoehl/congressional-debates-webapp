SPEECH OF HON. K. H. DUELL,
OF NEW YORK,
In the House of Representatives,
June 14, 1860.
The House being in the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union— "*
Mr. DUELL said:
Mr. Chairman: I propose at this time to call
the attention of the House to some facts connected
with our public expenditures. At tlte commence-
ment of the present session of Congress, the Sec-
retary of the Treasury submitted his annual
report, from which it appears that the total ex-
penditures of this Government, inclusive of the
public debt, during the fiscal year Milling June
30, 1859, was $83,751,511 57—a larger sum than
has ever been expended ill anyone year since the
adoption of the Constitution. This amount was
applied to the various brandies of the public ser-
vice, as follows:
Civil, foreign intercourse, and raiscellane- ^ ^ ^
Indians and pensions  S
Expenses of W;ir Department.
Expenses of Navy Department
Redemption of Treasury notes
  23,-143,822 38
14,712,610 21
17,405,285 44
751.511 57
In order to ascertain whether there has been a
prodigal expenditure of the people's money, we
should, in the first place, compare this with former
periods. The expenses of* our Government, down
to the end of Mr. Jefferson's administration, ap-
pear to have been frugal and exemplary. The
coRt of Washington's administration, for the
ivhole period of eight years, was only $15,892,188;
John Adams's, four years, $21,450,351; Jeffer-
son's, eig'Af years, $41,300,788. As the war with
} to the economy of Jackson's administration, and
j $50,000,000 would be saved to the people of the
i United States annually.
| Sir, it can be shown that millions of dollars of
the people's money is not used for Government
purposes at all, but for party purposes. It goes
to political friends as a reward for partisan ser-
vices performed for the Administration. I can-
not, in the brief hour allotted me, point out all the
leakages in our national Treasury; but I propose
to call the attention of the House to a few of
tkem.
A very dangerous practicc has existed of voting
large contingent funds for the different depart-
ments of Government which presented tempta-
tions, and opened a flood-gate of corruption to
the higher and lower public functionaries. Many
hundred thousand dollars have in this way been
put at the discretion of the past and existing Ad-
ministrations, no small portion of which was
squandered for most unsuitable partisan or private
ends. The; practice of having large outstanding
appropriations lying over from one year to an-
other, which often amounted to many million, has
often been abused by applying such appropria-
tions to objects not designated by law, at the dis-
cretion of the Administration. In this way there
never was any want of funds, when a partisan
object required it, or a private whim was to be
gratified, or favorites wanted patronage. Secret
I and partisan emissaries were by this means sent
j out, under the guise of Government agents, for
this, that, or the other object, the chief errand
• being confidential, and* the Administration news-
papers of the country have likewise experienced
the benefits of*contingent and disposable funds in
the hands of the Executive and his agents.
The present condition of the Post Office De-
partment and its revenues is a matter deserving
the gravest consideration of the people. From a i
report recently made by the Postmaster General j
! to the Senate,! compile the following remarkable j

term of office, the expenses were increased, during j' tabic of receipts and losses of the postal service

Tyler, ^20,304,156; Polk, $36,736,100; Fillmore,

Such was the average o1 expenditures underpre- ;
vious Administrations, whilst, under Mr. Buch-
anan, they increased, in 1858, to $8"2,000,000, and
now, in 1850, to $83,000,000, and upwards; and
thrs, too, in a time of pcace, and with falling rev-
enue. Well may the people look with astonish-
ment and alarm on such a condition of affairs!
Compare the administration of Mr. Buchanan
with that of General Jackson, who, with revenues
at no time exceeding in the average $26,000,000,
yet paid all the legitimate expenditures of Govern-
ment, besides exti nguishing more than Jifty million
dollars of the public debt, whilst Mr. Buchanan,
with more than fifty million of revenue per an-
num, yet increases the public debt some twenty-
Jive million annually !
From the foundation of the Government down
to this day, the statesmen of our country have
urged upon us the necessity of rigid cconomy in
our public expenditures. Washington, Jefferson,
Madison, and Jackson, insisted upon an honest
administration of the Federal Government, that
labor might be lightly burdened. Mr. Buchanan,
in 1852, before he became President, declared that
$50,000,000 per annum was an "enormous sum,"
and invoked the strong arm of the Democracy to
interpose and arrest the increasing expense of
Government, for fear it might, in a few years,
reach $100,000,000.
It will be seen, Mr. Chairman, that during the
administration of General Washington, the costs
of the General Government were only fifty cents
to each inhabitant per annum. The population
of the United States was then about four million,
and the expenses of the Government about two
million dollars annually. The population of the
United States is now about twenty-eight million,
and the costs of the Government is about three
dollars to each inhabitant. During the adminis-
tration of General Jackson, even, the costs of the
Government amounted annually to but one dollar
to each inhabitant. Bring this Government back

It appears that, in 1850 and 1851, there was an
excess of revenue over the expenses. The course
of losses since 1851 has been most extraordinary,
beginning at over two million in the first year,
and i is'ins to nearly eight million in 3859. The
loss in 1859 is greater than the total revenue, the
entire revenue being $1,000,000 more than in
1851, when the service paid a profit to the Gov-
ernment. The full sum of loss since 1852, during
all of which time the Democratic party has been
in power, is no less than g32,9J0,575, or an aver-
age of more than four million dollars a year. Now,
the annual loss has got up nearly to eight million,
and, at the same rate of progress, it will be
§30,000,000 in the year 1869.
One secret of the present condition of affairs
will appear in the following table, showing the
increase of cost, as compared with 1850, in a few
of the older States—an increase which demon-
strates that it is now a guild scheme of local pat-
ronage. The increase has been greatest where
it should have been least, and it is perfectly evi-
dent that a radical reform is needed:

Thus the service of thirteen States, all old, and
undergoing few changes since 1850, comes to cost
two and a half times as much to carry the mails
now as then. This is about the rate of increase
for all of the old States, while, in the new ones,
of course the increase is ten to a hundred fold.
The management of the Post Office is a disgrace
to the people of the United States. In many-
places, the inhabitants, who pay large and ample
sums for postage, are cut off from mail facilities,
and are compelled to eithercarry theirmails them-
selves or do without them. The whole cost ot De-
partment <uid mail service in 1850 was $5,220,214;
and in 1859, §15,404,276—just time times as much.
Excessive expenditure is everywhere apparent.
As an illustration, compare these two items for
1850 and 1859:
Route agents—1850, $58,2G6; 1859, $377,225.
Printing blanks—1850,§30,638; 1859,$117,171.
Now, sir,"in 1790, when thePost Office Depart-
ment went into operation, it was a self-support-
ing establishment. From that time down to 1850,
a period of sixty years, the Department had more
than sustained itself; but after 1851 the expenses
began to increase, so that in 1859 there was a
deficit, as I before stated, of nearly eight million
dollars. "Whatexplanation can be furnished,con-
sistently with honesty and fair dealing ? None,
sir, none ! -
Let us look at some of the items of this expend-
iture. We are told by the Postmaster Geneial,
in his report, that we have six Pacific mail routes;
and they are very unproductive, and all but one
unnecessary, in my judgment. On one of these
routes, only three letters and twenty-six news-
papers were carried in nine months; and yet it
cost the Government §79,000 to carry these three
letters and twenty-six newspapers! Mi. Pearce,
a Democratic Senator from Maryland, thus
summed up the expense of running these six
routes, a few days since, in the Senate:
"Tlic gioss annual disbursements tor these six routes
aie thus *hown to have been ;*;2,181,000, while the leceipu
were but $339,000 ; the Greater part of which came Irani
the ocean mail fioiu New York,l>y vva) of Panama, to fcan
Francisco. The annua! expenditures for local mall ser-
vice, m Cah.brma. Utah, Washington," and Oiegon, are
about live handled and eight thousand dollars. Add that
to the $2,184,000, and you have an a;;qie nru of §12,663,000
appropriated for the seiviec ol the Pacific mail-, and the
local seivieeel those State's and TeiritoriCs. They contain
about MX bundled anil II,'ty thoa-euul people; and if the
postal e\p"Ti(hturc- lor the lost of the people la this Union
were in exact piopornon to tlie-e. the postal service of the
eouutrv would eostabontoae hundred anil twenty-six mil-
lion dollar per annum-"
There was an appropriation of $40,000 for Post
Office blanks. This job was given to a political
friend of the Administiation, who made a clean
profit of $30,000; and this fund was used, with
the knowledge and advice of the President, to keep
alive two of the Administration newspapers of the
country. The conduct of the President was so
manifestly wrong hi tins affair that his political
friends denounced him on the floor of Congress.
Mr. Pryor, a Democrat, from Virginia, in speak-
ing of the transaction, said:
Look at the disclosures which have been biouglit be-
fore tlie House at this very session. J know lhat sonic gen-
tlemen upon this side of the Chamber aie deposed, or indi-
cate a deposition, to thtow the vail of concealment over
revelations of executive abuse. I have no sueh inclina-
tion, sir. They aie enorinou-.. They aie crying grievances;
grievance*, I a^uie gentlemen, winch smell veiv badly in
the lUHtrilf of the people.
" Take, for exam pie, the punting of the Post Office blanks,
by winch, after the work i.-s done, the surplus ot appropria-
tion ij> distributed among the stipendiaries ot executive
patronage. Gentlemen say, to be sure, that the excess is
onlv distuhuted anions the fuend> of the Administration.
Ve.i v well 5 if it was to he expended at all, it wai right to
dlstubute it among the fnend- ol thw Administration. But
why did not the President inl'oim Congtess that the law ap-
propriated an extensive amount ot* inomn fortius specihe
service, and nugget a large deduction tiom an exoibitant
appropriation? Instead 01 leeommendui" meli a reduc-
tion, instead of indicating to the Represent <itiv«- ot the peo-
ple that here was an instance in which they might save a
considerable ^um to an exhausted Treasury, that surplus
expenditure was distributed among the partisans ot the Ad-
mmbtiation. Now, sii, for one, ^denounce it. lam not
responsible for it. t invoke the judgment of the people
against it."
Now, sir, I will turn my attention to other
cases of pecuniary corruption. Take the case of _
Fort Snclling, which was this: the fort and ap-
purtenances costthe Governmentabout fifty thou-
sand dollars. Attached to it, as a military res-
ervation, was a tract of eight thousand acres of
beautiful land, at the junction of the Mississippi
