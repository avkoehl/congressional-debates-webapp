You are requested to consider whether you are not already making too wide a separation between the body of troops under your immediate command and your supporting force. It is possible that events may make it necessary to transfer the command of General Shields to the Department of the Rappahannock, and you are desired to act accordingly.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

Major General JOHN C. FREMONT,

Wheeling, Va.:

SIR: Your letter of the 16th instant, asking that your requisition for infantry arms be filled entirely by Enfield rifles in place of muskets, has been received.

In reply, the Secretary of War directs mr to say that it was referred to the Chief of Ordnance, who returns it which the following indorsement:

The only requisition for infantry arms received from General Fremont is the order of the Secretary of War, dated 11th instant, to furnish 2,500 Enfield rifles. On the 12th Captain Crispin, at New York, was directed to send this number of Enfields to General Fremont from arms he had on hand.

P. H. WATSON,
