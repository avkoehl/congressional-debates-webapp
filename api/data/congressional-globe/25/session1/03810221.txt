Moking public officers depositories—Mr. BayarL
Senate.
$26,792,006 of pubuc deposite*, wmle their imme-
diate liab luies do not bear to their immediate
means a much largsr ratio than two and a qua1 ter
to one, leaving t^e entue debt due to them from
the community for loans, and discounts as a s"cunty
for the difference
Banks, Mr President, are no the authors of
commercial distress, although it is true tb ¡ may,
and often do, feed that appetite for «¡peculation
which leads to it Nor, si', is commercial distress
ordinarily connected with the quantity or nature of
the currency of the courtri, it results from the
want of capital for the time bamg, not from the re-
dundancy or from the w mt of currency, much less
from the nature of that currency, whether metallic
•or mixed It oceuis m all countries, with every
■description of currency, paper, metallic, and mixed
It is tee result of that love of gam which stimulates
the enterprise of tie merchant, and broods over
the piotec's of the speculator, which leads the one
to search in foreign climes for those subjects of
commerce which are to be distributed for consump-
tion, and causes the other to dam up the streams of
supp'v, with a view to the augrrented profits of an
unsatisfied demand, which prevails mo=t where
there is most freedom of thought and action, and
■which ends m those commercial orgasms which,
with periodical occurrence, prostrate for a time
all commercial energv, by impairing all commer-
cial confidence
The Preside it, in his late Message, with a sort
of twihght perc°ption of the truth, speaks atone
moment of the redundancy of credit, and at another
•of the redundancy of circulation, as the cause of
the present commercial embarrassments Theie
■can be no redonaancv of circu'ation where the
papprofa mixed currency is conxertib'e If the
paper is not wanted foi the purpose of cu Tener, it
is returned to the b «n! s That the fact is so the
elementary principies oí the science of political
economy ■would teach >j>, but we have daily and
abundant evidence of its truth in the bank reports
Thus we find, by the reports of the Secretary of
the Treasury at the last session, upon the state oí
the finances, that «hile, on the 1st day of Jaruary,
1836, the gross amount of no'es issued by the
■banks was $140,000,000, the amount in circulation
Mas onb £108,000,000, making a difference of
32,000,000, which h?d been returned to them, and
remained m their hands Here I might advert to
that inuccuiacy in matters of fact which prevails
in the President's Message, and which has bepn
so fully an 1 ablv exposed by the Senator from
Georgia, (Mr King,) tn other particulars, and
which is manifested likewise in relation to this very
matt r of the currencj The Message states the
amount of paper circulation to have been $140,-
000,000 on the 1st of January, Í83G, when, in
truth, that w?s the amount of notes issued, but of
which §32,000,000 hid been withdrawn from en-
cu'a'ton The erioristhe more me/cusabk, be-
cause the Secretary of the Trea&jr), in his las*
annual rep ri on the finances, ma1e at the former
session, in that part of it which treats of the mint
and currency, explicitly states the fact, and d «an-
guishes between the gross amount of notes issued
and the actual circulation The present commer-
cial distress, the fiist svmp'oms of which were ex-
hibited in New Orleans, in the f"i'nre of several
commercial hon^s there foi an ímmens  amount,
owes its existence, wi bout doubt, to the wilct «pint
of specua'ion which Mas prevahng th ou«hout
the country, and to the employment of the banking
capital of the country in enterprise, whnhwerp
not of a commercial chaiacter, but, lemgin their
nature pormanent investments, w ere, in effect, dead
loans, and therefoie hostile to the interest and
purposes of banking The case of the plantéis of
Mississippi is a complete lllustiation of *he whole
subject Thej were m the habit of receiving, on
loan, large sums of mone>, with which they pur-
chased lands and negroes, and pledged me r crops
for the siadual repayment Th s was do ie bv
drawing bills of exchange on the meiehant in New
Orleans, and these bill , being accepted, were
afterwaids discounted bj the banks The planters,
from the fall in the price of their great staple, cot-
ton, were unable to furnish the merchant with the
means of paying these bdls w hen they came to
maturity, and the merchant, on his part, not hav-
ing capital enough to carry on his other operations
and meet these demands, fails , which disaster
deranges ard mars the whole Web of cohmercial
affairs
"VWh people engaged m 'arge commercial ope-
rations, andenjo}inga vast and almost unbounded
credit, suddenly fail, a shock is guen to public
confidence m all men of business, which for a time
breaks the charmed circle of credit, and the com
mercial w( rid falls into a sort of syncope, from the
suspended action of the great pnnc pie of its vitali-
ty, commaciai confidence It maj be Hue that the
great increase of banking capital led to this spmt
of speculation, and to these enterprises and emplo--
ments, whici, not being of a commercial nature,
ought not to have been undert ken on the faith of
banking capital Yet who, I ask, is responsmle for
that .increase of banks'' Who but the past admi-
nistration, 'hat, n its lawless act of the 'emov>l of
the deposites, and the s b^equent desKu^'ion of the
Bank of the United States, gave atorre an apology,
as well as created a seeming, if no' real, necessity
tor thecreat on oí new banks in cveiy State of the
Union' L~t it never be forgotten, that n the year
1830, the second year of the admtmstntion of \n
drew Jackson, there weie hut 330 banks, with an
est mated cap tal of $145,192,268, as appears from
the Secretary's report at the last Sess on upon th?
subject of the banks, and that, in the last }eur
oí his administration, on the 1st of December,
1836, theie were 677 banks, with 146 branches,
and an authorised cap tal of $378,421,168
The immediate cause of the suspension of specie
pajments, which commenced in  New York, the
gicat commercial emporium or the countrj, was,
no doubt, the unfavorable condition of (he foreign
exchange, growing out if the debt \ hich 1 if beei
uicuied toCiCat Butaiu, if f"ilv or filtv millions
of dollars    Not possessing  the means of paying
thai debt m ihe products oí the counlry, nor being
able to proem e a postponement of it  payment,
the specie of Ihe country was  required  for that
purpose, as  the only art cle of co mnerce, w h ch,
havng universal value, is  the only one  which is
every where exchangeab'e for ill othei commod -
ties, and  the banks, as  the   largest deposit >nes of
that article, were eiiled up n to furnish  t     But
what was their condition''   The) had been cripple 1
m then reso rces for tbpsupp'yof that  a    "ic !>v

wards the \ est,   oy the   1-st men me or '1 e adm
nistration—the  Spec p   circular—which   h->d   the
effect, as was most ably and satisfactorily esiab'ish-
ed by the Senator  fiom Geoign, (M-   King,) of
removing it, con trarj to all the la is of trade and of
common sense, from the place where it was «anted
to the place where it was of no immediate use, and
from whence, m the  nature of things, it  muet be
forced nltmately to íeturn     But ¡n the nipan t me
the  mischief is  done     The banks of New Yorl

here be  tempted to exckim " q tamp i* s<i¡t ntia

hid a lesson  and  a  seveieone m the thro s and
convulsions to which it has been subjected under
the past administration, never again  to *rust the
holm of Government to  the hands  of any rain
who is not possessed of the competent attainments
and training oí civil life; and 'hat it is not suffi-
cient that a man should enjoy the reputation of
hones } and common sense to entitle him to claim
from the American people the important trust of
presiding oyer their welfaie, without any familan-
ty with the complicated interests oi a commercial
and cmlized community
But whj, sir, I ask again, this hostility to the late
deposite banks' Y/hy this new experiment' I will
tell jou, sir There musí be some new rattle, some
new straw, to please and tici le the grow n children
of ti io nation I recollect i nee hearing it said that
when tne Count Sur/ilUeis, the biother of the late
Frrperor Napoleon, was introduced to Pres dent
Jackson, the latter distinguished individual said to
the Count, " I Inve always, sn, taken your illus-
trious biomer for my model in wai " This, to be
sn~e, w as v ery modest, and if one should be dis-
poned to think that there was some difference
between the campaigns of Itaiy and those uf a
Creek or Seminole w-i, between the invasion ol
Russia and that of Florida, yet it should be ob-
ser- (d tint the remaik does not import equality}
but merely imitation, and we all know that a c>py
may be mo e or les-, hutible, according to the
mears and abilities oi the aitist But let us see
whethei this admiration of the great original may
not have M to the adoption of some of his maxims
of c vil government I remember, sir, once coming
act oss a passage in one of the works of that cele-
brited woman Madame de Stael, uhicn gives a
slight sketch of the chaiacter and policy of the
Emperor, and I rememb r, too, that upon recently
reading it, I was suack with some points of resem->
bianco in th" charicter and poucy of the two men
The faei Is of the latp President, who knew hira
b st, ,v Jl judge ho far the resemblance holds, but
it seems to me tint the pissage maj be regaided as
a sibylline oracle of the events of the last eight
years It may be found in her little work entitled
"Ten Years' Exile," and runs thus, in the English
translation or that work.
