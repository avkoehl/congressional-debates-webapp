off till I get away. I hope I shall be able to leave here without anything happening, but I have to keep up a very strict guard and watch over my men. I leave here day after to-morrow.

With respect, Your obedient servant,

ALF. SULLY,

Brevet Major-General.

P. S. -I open this to tell You that I have just heard from Galpin. His wife got thrown from her horse and hurt a little. He had to remain at Berthold a few days, but all is going on well. A major and 200 men of the Third Illinois had reached Berthold; the rest of the troops were on the Cheyenne. They had met no Indians. The major gave chase to a small party, but very fortunately did not catch them. The Indians who belong here got safely into their camp. Had any of them been killed by the major, Indian affairs would have been in a bad state and no prospects of peace.

Yours, truly,

ALF. SULLY,
