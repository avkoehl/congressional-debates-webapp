Numbers 3. Report of Brigadier General John E. SMITH, U. S. Army, commanding First Brigade, THIRD DIVISION, including operations May 1-June 4. HDQRS. 1ST BRIGADE, 3rd DIVISION, 17TH ARMY CORPS,

Before Vicksburg, MISS., June 23, 1863.

MAJOR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by the First Brigade since the battle of Thompson's Hill, near Port Gibson, MISS., on the 1st of May, 1863 (a report of which I had the honor to transmit soon after), to June 4, 1863:

On the 2nd day of May, about 10 a. m., I received orders from Major-General Grant to move out with my command and cross the south fork of Bayou Pierre, at the ford about 3 1/2 miles east of Port Gibson, and gain the main road from Port Gibson to Vicksburg, which I accomplished about 2 p. m., halting near the residence of the rebel Colonel B. G. Humphreys, Twenty-first Regiment Mississippi Volunteers. I found no enemy, but discovered in store about 7,000 or 8,000 pounds of bacon, which was secured and distributed to the troops. This proved a valuable acquisition to our limited supplies.

The DIVISION having crossed at Port Gibson, now, 5 p. m., moved up.

*No loss reported.

+Held mainly in reserve. The following-named regiments appear to have been the most actively employed: Forty-eighth and FIFTY-NINTH Indiana, Tenth Missouri, and Eightieth Ohio.
