Major-General HOWARD,

Smyrna, Ga.:

Orders 277 places troops on the MISSISSIPPI River under command of one officers, as is proper. You still have the department to include Tennessee River and down into Alabama and MISSISSIPPI as far as you can get. The general also construes [it that] you retain A. J. Smith's two DIVISIONS which are now an route.

Brigadier General John E. SMITH,

Cartersville, Ga.:

Arrest some six or eight citizens know or supposed to be hostile. Lot one or two go free to carry word to the guerrilla band that you give them forty-eight hours' notice that unless all the men of ours picked up by them in the past two days are returned, Kingston, Cassville, and Cartersville will be burned, as also the houses of the parties arrested. I suppose that band of guerrillas is known to you, and you can know where to strike.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

Brigadier-General KILPATRICK,

Marietta, Ga.:

The general does not want to bring forward or send back any dismounted cavalry, but desires you to make up your command from mounts as they now are, and if any are not mounted, he can make good use of them with the infantry.

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.

WASHINGTON, November 8, 1864-11 a. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

General Schofield, as the commander of an army, ranks General Stanley, as the commander of a corps. It was therefore proper for you to assign Stanley to Schofield's command. A former order of General Sherman's placing Schofield unders Stanley was disapproved by the War Department.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
