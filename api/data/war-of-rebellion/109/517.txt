Major-General THOMAS:

My spies report Longstreet on the 11th moving in force from MOrristown toward Strawberry Plains. He is bringing supplies by rail from Jonesborough. I cannot learn that he has received any re-enforcements, and do not think he has. I interpret his movement to mean simply the occupation of Strawberry Plains.
