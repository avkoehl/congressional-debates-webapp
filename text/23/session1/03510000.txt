Wí h tne reioim of the gold cuirency, it is
proper to associate measures to prevent the issue
of small notes The only step which Congress
could with piopnety take, in relation to the notes
of the State banks., would be to provide that no
banl£ should be a deposit ir/ of the public money,
nor should the rioter of any bank be leceivable in
pavmerit of debis to the United States, which
issued notes below a certain denomination We
may safely íely on the cooperation of the several
States to impose upon their banks the lestr.Uions
necessary to aid in this desnable change in the
btate of the cuirency The alteration proposed,
shou'd, howevei, be gradual. A day might be
fixed after which the lestnction abovemer-tioned
«hould go into operation,as íelates to notes below
live dollars A further restnction, so as to affect
notes, under ten dollars, would hereafter be ad-
visable, and ought to be ¡egarded as a part of the
plan now proposed to be adopted. But it is not
desirable, at this time, to name a definite day for
that purpose. A great proportion of the issues of
the State banks consists of five dollar notes. Any
measure calculated to impair the currency of notes
of this description, about the time the Bank of
the United S'ates is going out of existence, would
be injurious to the public When the Bank of the
United States is withdrawing us notes from circu-
lation, the void must be filled up by gold and silvei,
or by the notes of the State banks, or thecurrency
will be injuriously contracted And if notes of
five dollars weie then put out of circulation, the
diminution of the currency would perhaps be
severelyfelt And no measureshould beadopted,
calculated to impede their circulation, until it shall
be manifest that the country is leheved ftom any
inconvenience arising from the withdiawal of the
notes of the Bank of the United States But as
soon as that period arrives, and it is apparentthat
gold and silver can be provided foi the ordinary
circulation below ten dollars, it would beadvisable
to extend the restriction to notes of that denomi-
nation. For we can never be safe from the fluc-
tuations of the currency until ail notes below ten
dolíais aie banished from circulation. And it will
be still more secure when the restriction is carried
up to notes of twenty dollars, so as to substitute
the gold eagles in the place often dollai bank notes
It will be seen fiom this statement, that it is i o
pa> t of the pioposedplan to dispense with the State
banks.    It obviously is not in the powei of Con   i
gress (if it desired to do so) to take any measures I
for that purpose, without an  amendment to the
Constitution, and the States would not, and ought
not to suriender the power of chartering banking
companies   Tne State banks are now so numerous,
and are so intimately connected with our habits
and pursuits, that it is imoossible to suppose that
the system can evei be entirely abandoned     Nor |
is it desirable that it should be.    They are often
abused, like all other human institutions, yet their
advantages are many, and undei proper regula-
tions, and with the metallic basis now proposed
for their paper issues, they will be found of much ,
public advantage                                                          j
If there were no State banks, the profitable busi-
r-ess of banking and exchange would be monopo-
lized by the great capitalists     Opeiations of this
silt lequue tapi'al and credit to a laige extent, I
and a private individual m modélate circumstances
would be unable to conduct them with any advan-
tage     Yet there is perhaps no business which
yields a profit so ceitam and hberal as the business '
of bank.ng and exchange, and it is proper that it
should be open, ¡>s far as piacticable, to the mos.. !
fiee competition, and its advantages shaied by all
classes ot society   Irdivmuals of moderate means
cannot particir ate in them unless they combine to-
gether, and  by the union of manv small sums, I
oieate a laige cipitil and estaUish an extensive
credit     It 19 impossible to accomplish this object
without the ai 1 of acts of incorporation, so as to
give to the company the secui sty of unity ofaction,
and save it from  the  disadvantage of frequent |
changes in thepartneiship, by the death or retne-
22
mentof some one of the numerous partneis The
incoiporated banks,moreover,under proper regu-
lation , will offer a safe and convenient investment
of small sums to persons whose situations and pur
suits disable them from employing their money
profitably in any other mode It is not more liable
to be lost when vested in the stock of a bank than
when it is loaned to individuals. The interest on
it is paid with more punctuality, and it can be sold
and converted into cash whenever th# owner de-
sires to employ it in some other way, and if a
laiger poition of the metals a>e infused into the
circulation, the business of banking will become
more sound and wholesome, and less liable to the
disasters fiom which it has suffered under an ex-
travagant and ill organized system of paper issues
It will render investments in banking companies
entirely safe and secure to the holders, and afford
them the almost absolute certainty of aieasonable
profit, without endangeung the capital invested in
it. For this reason, it is neither practicable nor
desirable to discountenance the continuance of the
State banks
They are convenient and useful, also, for the
purposes of commerce No commercial or man-
ufacturing community coufd conduct its business
to any advantage without a liberal system of
credit, and a facility of obtaining money on loan
when the exigency of their business may require
it This can.lot be obtained without the aid of a
paper circulation founded on credit It is, there
fore, not the interest of this country to put down
the papei currency altogether
The great object should be to give to it a foun-
dation on which it will safely stand A circulating
medium, composed of papei, and gold,and silver,
in just proportions, would not be liable to be con-
stantly dtsorueied by the accidental embarrassments
or imprudences of tiade, nor by a combination of
the moneyed interest for political put poses The
value of the metals m circulation would remain the
same,whethertherewasa pane or rot, and the pro-
portion of paper being less, the credit of the hanks
could not be so readily impaired or endangered.
The state of the currency, then, which is pro-
posed in the foregoing resolutions, would provide
silver and gold for oidmary domestic purposes
and the smallei payments, and the banks of the
dnTerent States would easily be able to furnish
exchanges between distant places, according to
the wants of commerce There cannot, therefore,
be any necessity for a papei cnculation of general
credit throughout the country Funds are more
conveniently and safely transferred from place to
place by drafts and bills of exchange than by bank
notes. The immense operations between differ-
ent parts of the United States are now chiefly
carried on by this means, and it is only in particular
places, and foi comparatively small amounts, that
notes aie used, and the local institutions would,
without doubt, in a very short time make arrange-
ments among themselves to furnish tne exchanges
which commerce requires, and the competition
among many would reduce the late of exchange
to its pi oper level Besides, they would find it their
interest to make agreements among themselves to
honor each other's notes to a ceitam extent, and
thus furnish, as fai as might be necessary, apaper
cuuency of geneial cnculation, m such places
as would be likely, fiom their intercourse with
each othei,to requne such a convenience But
theestabhshment of s ich a papei currency ought
not to have any aid, direct or incidental, by legis-
lative provisions While it íests upon mutual ar-
rangements among the banks themselves, they will
keep the issues of each othei within proper bounds
But when they are able to extend their credit by
any legal piovsions m favor of their notes, the
temptation is constantly presented to avail them-
selves of this advantage, and over-issues and
oveitrading aie the necessaiy consequences If,
however, a different policy should be deemed ad-
visable, the edvanta^es now given by ¡aw to the
Bank ot the United States might easily be extended
to the notes of the depository banks; and if their
notes were made receivable in payment of all debts
to the Government, their currency and general
credit would be quite equal to that now" enjoyed
by the Bank of the United States Believing, how-
ever, lhat such a provision would be calculated to
increase the issues of paper, I cannot recommend
it. The chief object of the plan 1 propose is to
increase the proportion of the metallic currency
without diminishing inconveniently the general
mass of the circulating medium, and any provision
tending to enlarge the proportion of paper beyond
wlat the public convenience requires should be
studiously avoided.
The advantages of the proposed plan over the
present currency will not be confined to the supe-
rior stability of the caper circulation
The laboung classes of the community are now
paid their daily, or weekly wages, in bank notes
of the smaller denominations, and if there are any
in circulation of doubtful value and depreciated in
public estimation, they are too often used in pay-
ments to the poorer and more helpless classes of
society. "Tney are not always judges of the value
or genuineness of the notes offered to them, and
consequently, are often imposed upon, and their
small earnings still more diminished, by the depre-
ciated character or entire worthlessness of paper
in which they are paid If the alteration sug-
gested should oe adopted, the smaller notes would
soon be banished from circulation everywhere, and
the laborer would, therefore, be paid in gold and
silver, and that portion of society which is most
apt to suffer from worthless or depreciated paper,
and who are least able to bear the loss, would be
guarded from imposition and injustice It is time
that thejust claims of this portion of society should
be regarded m our legislation m relation to thecur-
rency So far we hav e been providing facilities for
those employed in extensive commerce, and have
left the mechanic and the laborer to all the hazards
of an insecure and unstable circulating medium.
It may be objected to this plan, that in giving to
the executive department, the power of selecting
these fiscal agents from among the State banks, an
undue influence may be exercised over them, and
the powei be used for improper and corrupt pur-
poses The answer to it appears to be a plain one.
The States in which these institutions are situated
can at all times control them, and would effec¡tually
interpose to prevent such abuses of power. Be-
sides, with the diminished revenue which will here-
after be collected, on the reduced tariff of duties, it
is impossible to imagine that the gams to be derived
from thepubliedeposites,when distributed, as they
must be, among so many banks, and among so
many stockholders in each bank, can ever be suf-
ficiently important to tempt them to swerve from
their duty, or to influence, in any respect, their
conduct or opinions.
But it is proper, no doubt, in all cases, to restrict
political power within certain and defined limits,
and it will be advisable, therefore, to regulate the
selection in such a manner as to remove all appre-
hensions of its abuse. The following are respect-
fully suggested for consideration:
If the danger of abuse is considered by Congress
as one of any magnitude, and as likely to produce
improper influence, it may be effectually removed,
by male tne, it theduty of the Secretary of theTreas-
ui y to divide the deposites among all the incorpo-
rated specie paying banks of the place where the
revenue is collected, in proportion to their respect-
ive capitals actually paid m, provided they are all
willing to receive them upon the terms prescribed
by law , and if they are not all willing, then among
so many as would agiee to take them.
Eveiy danger of abuse in the selection will, by
this mode, be taken away, and the safety of the
money could be secured, by authorizing the Sec-
letaiy of the Tieasury to demand seeunty from
any of these banks, when, in his judgment, the
public interest requued it, and there might also ba
a prohibition against removing the money to any
place, except where it was immediately necessaiy
for the purpose of disbursement.
