Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Second Corps:

General Warren is to move down dirt* road to attack the force opposing Sheridan in rear, with two divisions. He is to send a division down the Boydton plank road to join Sheridan. You are to remain on the defensive and strengthen your position.

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865-11 p.m.

(Received 2.45 a.m. April 1.)

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

If I resume the position of this morning just before daylight I suppose it will answer.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865-11.30 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Second Corps:

General Ord reports he will establish batteries, taking in reverse a work of the enemy in front of your right, which he thinks he can render so untenable as to make its capture by you easy. Should this be the case you will endeavor to take it. Confer with General Ord on the subject and co-operate with him. You have been notified that the Fifth Corps will be withdrawn to operate against Dinwiddie. Whatever you do must be done with your own troops.

GEO. G. MEADE.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865-12.25 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Commanding Second Corps:

In reply to your dispatch of 12 p.m. General Warren having retired, I have the honor to state that General Griffin occupies a line of works from the left of your line on the Boydton plank road, running one-quarter of a mile west, then refused to the rear until it again strikes the plank road near the junction of the Quaker road; from thence south on the plank road a few hundred yards. The left of his picket-line rests near a large branch of Gravelly Run.

Respectfully,

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
