(Received 9.15 a. m.)

Brevet Major-General KELLEY:

At 7 this morning I received a telegram from Captain Hagans, eight miles north of Buckhannon. He says:

I entered Buckhannon last evening at 6 o'clock. The rebels left yesterday at 12. I think they have entirely disappeared, going in the direction of Webster County. They could attack Beverly from that direction.

H. H. HAGANS.
