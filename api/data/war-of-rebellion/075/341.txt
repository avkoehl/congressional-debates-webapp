No notice of Major-General McPherson's orders to you have been received here. In absence of any definite instructions from him as to your route, you had better proceed to Chattanooga and thence to Kingston and report from there. Colonel all detachments left behind by Blair and who may be fit to travel, and take them with you.

Lieutenant C. L. WHITE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have just learned 200 rebels are crossing at Guntersville. I think they should be attacked to-morrow. Every night forays are made on the citizens this side the river. Last night a man was hung eight miles south of here. If 250 men could be sent to Woodville to-night I can concentrate as many here, one column to move from Woodville and the other from here.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

E. M. STANTON:

General Sherman telegraphs for 5,000 men via Memphis, and 5,000 via Louisville, to go out on his lines. Present orders her require my 100 days' men at Helena, Ark. Can the order be changed in accordance with General Sherman's wishes? The health of these raw men would be much preserved by not going to Helena. Two more regiments ready by Tuesday evening.
