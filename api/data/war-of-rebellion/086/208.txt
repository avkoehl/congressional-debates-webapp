WESTPORT, October 23, 1864.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

The enemy turned upon us and commenced a strong assault upon my advance this morning, and a hard battle has been progressing for two hours. I am deploying re-enforcements of militia, and the enemy now seem to be retiring.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE BORDER,Battle-field, October 23, 1864-1.05 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK:

We have driven the enemy seven or eight miles south of Westport. We now seems to be moving due south, but some of his lines may have retreated west into Kansas. Pleasonton's and Rosecrans' guns are heard on my left, and our forces will soon join. Our success is glorious. We are still in hot pursuit.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE BORDER,Little Santa Fe, Mo., October 23, 1864-5.30 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy is in full retreat and much demoralized. He moves directly south on and near the Line road. General Pleasonton united his forces with mine at 2 o'clock. Our losses are inconsiderable. We lost one gun yesterday and took one to-day. The pursuit will be renewed at daylight. After four days' obstinate fighting the men and horses are much exhausted and must have a little rest.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

INDIAN CREEK, MO., October 23, 1864-2.30 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Your dispatch duly received. I have had a hard fight this morning before the rebels gave way, but about an hour ago General Pleasonton's forces crowded the enemy on my left and his rout was complete. He now retreats cautiously, but as fast as possible. My horses are in good condition and we can continue the pursuit with success if provisions can be brought forward fast enough.

Very respectfully,

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
