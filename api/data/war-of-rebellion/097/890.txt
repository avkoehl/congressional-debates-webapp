railroad bridge over the Staunton River, and the gauge of the road will have to be altered from this point to Danville before our rolling-stock can be used; but it is understood there is a large amount of rollingstock at Danville which we can secure, and then it will only be necessary to rebuild the bridge over the Staunton River about 600 feet from the road to be used at this point. These facts are sent for your information.

Brigadier-General BENHAM,

Commanding Engineer Brigade:

Owing to the difficulty in supplying the bridge train at Staunton River General Wright is ordered to sent it back to this point after crossing his command, unless they should conflict with General Sheridan's orders. The general commanding therefore directs that you send with it sufficient guard to escort the bridge should it return to this point.
