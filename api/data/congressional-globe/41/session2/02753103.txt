The joint resolution was read. It instructs
the Secretary of War to cause a survey and
estimate to be made of the cost of removing

provided that the expense of said sarvey and

the joint resolution appropriates that sum of
money.  
Mr. SHELDON, of Louisiana. The sub-
committee of the Committee on Commerce
have agreed to report a similar provision, and
the officers are on the ground ready to make
the survey.
Mr. DAWES. I think this bill should go,
with other matters in reference to rivers and
harbors, to the Committee on Commerce.
Mr. SHELDON, of Louisiana. I re peat that
the sub-committee of the Committee on Com-
merce have considered this joint resolution
and agreed to report it. The engineer depart-
ment say that the officers are on the ground
now and can make the survey at much less
expense perhaps now than at some future
time.
Mr. DAWES. Have the Committee on
Commerce considered the matter ?
Mr.^SHELDON, of Louisiana. The sub-

referred to the Committee on the Public Lands.
Mr. SAWYER. I hope not; I trust the bill
will be passed now.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. If I can
have a few moments to explain the bill I think
there will be no objection to passing it now.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will state to the
Honse, in order that there may be no mis-
understanding, that in considering business on
the Speaker's table the Chair will recognize
the gentleman who desires to ask the sense of
the House upon the passage of each bill or joint
resolution as it maybe taken up. The bill will
be read in full, after which, if no motion be
made, the Chair will snbmit to the Honse the
question upon its third reading and passage.
Hie bill was read. It provides for legalizing
the location of agricultural college scrip allowed
prior to December 1,1867, at the several land
offices in the State of Wisconsin, in excess of
the maximum quantity authorized by the act
entitled " An apt donating public lands to the
several States and Territories which may pro-
vide colleges for the benefit of agriculture and
the mechanic arts," approved July 2,1862, and
authorizing the Commissioner of the Qeneral
Land Office to issue patents upon such loca-
tions, provided the same shall be legal and valid
in all other respects.
The question was upon ordering the bill to
be read a third time.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. The law
which authorized the issue of this land scrip
restricted the amount to be located in any one
State to one million acres. Before the books
could be posted, as it was afterward found, an
excess of some thousands of acres had been
located in the State of Wisconsin.
Mr. SAWYER. An excess of seventy-nine
thousand acres.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. TheCom-
missioner of the General Land Office asks that
the land so located in excess may be confirmed
and patented.
Mr. ALLISON. That is all right.
The bill was then read the third time, and
passed.
Mr. SAWYER moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed ; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
