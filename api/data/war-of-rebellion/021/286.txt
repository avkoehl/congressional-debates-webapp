No. 7. Reports of Lieutenant Col. H. H. Miller, Twentieth Mississippi Infantry.

PONCHATOULA, March 23, 1863 - 10.30 p. m.

Party of 20 men sent forward this evening advanced to within 1 mile of cotton schooners. Met the enemy and engaged him. He being in greatly superior force, compelled retreat. Skirmishing upon my advanced pickets. Enemy appeared to be engaged in some kind of work on railroad. Night so dark and rainy impossible to operate before daylight. Railroad track only road to advance. That from any pickets to enemy is trestle work, on high embankments, with impassable swamp either side. Will advance in morning. If any possibility of success will attack. Will use every effect to execute your order to retake or bun vessels. The Choctaw battalion ordered here has not reported. Can I be re-enforced? From information received from various sources am induced to believe this post will soon be attacked.

FOUR MILES BELOW PONCHATOULA,

March 24, 1863 - 11 a. m.

I have been engaged with the enemy since early this morning, with occasional skirmishing during the night. Cannot estimate his force, but greatly superior to mine. He has charge me repeatedly, but always repulsed.

Your dispatch received at the moment we were pursuit them. Have sent flank of truce to communicate your instructions. Enemy entrenched 1 mile below me. Considering ground to charge over I have not attempted to dislodge them. Is it possible to re-enforce? Can you give me two guns? I need ammunition. Please send it by special train. Thus far I have lost but 2. Gunboat reported coming up Ponchatoula River to flank me. Some picket firing in that direction. have sent officers to report.
