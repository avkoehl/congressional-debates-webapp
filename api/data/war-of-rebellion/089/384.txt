Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Army Corps:

General Parke sent in work about half an hour ago that just before Willcox's column passed the fort at Hawks' about 1,000 of the enemy's dismounted cavalry passed down the Duncan road. You have probably struck them.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 27, 1864-9 a.m.

Major-General WARREN:

Hancock has crossed Hatcher's Run. Parke has met the enemy and is pushing them back to their works. I have no idea he will be able to carry them, and it is of importance you should get over Hatcher's Run with a part of your command at least and communicate with Hancock.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.
