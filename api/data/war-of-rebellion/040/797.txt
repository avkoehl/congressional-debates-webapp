General Jones, saying, "Letter referred to in your indorsement on General Imboden's letter not yet received here." As I have not recently made any indorsement on any letter from General Imboden, I conclude the telegram was intended for Brigadier General W. E. Jones. I knew nothing of what telegram referred to.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

ADJUTANT AND INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE, May 26, 1863.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A., Richmond, May 13, 1863.

General R. E. LEE:

Your letter+ is conclusive against the suggestion made. Information believed to be reliable reports General Dix, with at least 5,000 men, landed and intrenching formidably at West Point, with what view I know not. You may better judge. Small forces only said to be left at Suffolk and Yorktown.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

General SAMUEL JONES, Dublin, Va.:

The salt-works are your especial charge, to be defended in all contingencies; how, whether by aid to East Tennessee or otherwise, your judgment can best determine. I leave with confidence the disposition of your forces to your own discretion.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
