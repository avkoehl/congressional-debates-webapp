BEALETON STATION, September 26, 1863.

(Received 5.20 p.m.)

WILLIAM P. SMITH,

Master of Transportation, Camden Station:

The Twelfth Corps is at this station awaiting transportation, which we hope you will be able to give us soon. I am unable to answer your query in regard to cars just now. I may say, however, that the Twelfth Corps has about 280 horses, and will require about 10 cars for baggage. I have just sent a dispatch to the Secretary of War, of which the following is an extract:

The battery co-operation of the officers has enabled me to rush matters forward more rapidly than originally contemplated either by Messrs. Garrett and Smith or myself. I have been in communication with Messrs. Garrett and Smith, and although they have not been able to meet our demands for cars, I think it due to them to say that they have done a vast amount of labor in the time and under all the circumstances.

D. C. McCALLUM,

Colonel, &amp;c.

AMASA STONE, JR., Esq.,

Can you not take charge of the subject of getting rolling stock form the western railroad companies? As you once had the subject under consideration, I am persuaded you can aid me with more facility and speed than any one else.

CLEVELAND, OHIO, September 26, 1863.

(Received 10.40 p.m.)

If you cannot do better, I will procure and forward rolling stock. Send me proper authority, and advise me whom I will confer with as to the amount required.
