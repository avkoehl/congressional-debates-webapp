Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

U. S. Army:

Raining again here; river still over its banks and not falling. Mobile paper of the 16th says: "Part of rebel Army of Tennessee," probably Lee's corps, "at Demopolis." Canby had evidently not begun to move when Colonel Parkhurst left Rienzi.

HUNTSVILLE, March 7, 1865.

Major B. H. POLK,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A flag of truce sent out from Decatur by Colonel Conrad returned last night. They report no rebels between Decatur and Courtland; 150 at or near Brown's Ferry, under command of Major Gilbert. Colonel Conrad reports that he this morning received reliable information that Roddey is again ordered to Selma. He has been sending his troops away in detachments. The last will go in a few days. General Walker, ex-Secretary of War, was at Roddey's headquarters last week. Can the general commanding not send me some cavalry? Much good work can be done if we could have it now.

Colonel, Commanding District.

NASHVILLE, TENN., March 7, 1865.

Colonel J. R. HURD,

Johnsonville:

If you can do any good by sending out a detachment after guerrillas, you have authority to send it. It is desired that the guerrillas be exterminated, but it is though much can be done against them with infantry alone.

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
