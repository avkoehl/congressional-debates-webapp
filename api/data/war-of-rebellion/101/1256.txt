HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ROLLA,Rolla, Mo., March 25, 1865.

Major J. W. BARNES,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the Missouri:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that the block-house fort in process of erection at this post is very nearly completed, and would suggest that the guns with which it is to be furnished be forwarded as soon as practicable. I am informed that requisitions for two 24-pounders were approved by Major-General Rosecrans, but that the raid prevented their being shipped.

JOHN MORRILL,

Colonel Sixty-fourth Illinois Volunteers, Commanding.

KANSAS CITY, March 25, 1865.

General McNEIL:

I have ordered company of First Missouri State Militia Cavalry now at Pleasant Hill, whose term of service has expired, to Warrensburg for muster out. Other companies will have to go in a few days. I guard the stage with infantry as far as Lee's Summit, but must soon leave the other half of the road unguarded unless I have more men. No disturbance since Saturday, and this morning's mail will be sent. They will go regardless hereafter.

CHESTER HARDING,

Colonel, &amp;c.

Brigadier General JOHN B. SANBORN,

Springfield, Mo.:

GENERAL: I have just received a dispatch from Major Burch, at Neosho, in which he informs me that thirty rebels passed Eight miles west of Neosho on the night of the 23rd instant, going in the direction of Sherwood, in Jasper County, but said they were going up north. I will start forty men in that direction in the morning to look after them. They will be out six days. After their return I will report to you the result of the scout.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN D. ALLEN,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

Send the rest of the Forty-third Missouri to Kansas City. I am told there is a regiment raising at Saint Joseph and one company already organized, which will protect that post; if not, send three companies down.
