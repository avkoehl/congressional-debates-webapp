Lieutenant Colonel C. KINGSBURY,Assistant Adjutant-General, Middle Military Division:

COLONEL: I have the honor to request that I may be granted permission to go to my home at Bath, N. Y., instead of Wheeling, W. Va., to await orders, as I can be communicated with there as quickly as at the latter place. For a long time I have been suffering from chronic dysentery, which has recently attacked me with increased violence. For the benefit of my health I request this indulgence.
