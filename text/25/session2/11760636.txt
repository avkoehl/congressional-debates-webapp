Senate*
reject the experience of the mobt civilized nations for some
centuries, as well as all out own experience, and have returned
to the rude conceptions of former times These certificates oí
deposite would soon be found to be often isbucd without any
solid capital, or actual deposite Abuses arising from this
source would call for legts ative interference, and the Legisla
ture would find d necessary to restrain t íe issue of paper in
te ided for cm ularion by enacting that such issue should only
be made on the stiength ofcornpe entcapita! actually piowderi
and assigned, place I under proptr regulations, and managed
by persons responsible to the laws And this would bring u 
again exactly to the state of things in which we now are, that
is to say, to the use ot the paper of banks, established, regu
lated, and con'rolled by law In the meantime, before this
pioce&3 could be earned through half the community won d
be make bankrupt by the rum of their business and by the
violent and rtvolu lonai y changes of property which the pro
ces3 would create The whole olass of debtois, all that live
moi by industry than on capital, would be overwhelmed with
unlistinguishmgdes íucuon

pecialy in the \ h t l St tie  v\ h> keep the public mone\-,
that is to say, why hoard them, why Aey them out oi u&e'
The use of money i#-in the exchange It is designed to cireu
late, not to be hoarded AU that Government should have to
do wnti it, h to ieceive it to day, that it may pay it away to
morrow It should not receive it, before it needs it and it
shou d part with u assoon as Howes it To kt>ep it—that is,
to detain it, to hold it back from general use, to hoard it, is a
conception belonging to barbarous times and barbi rou3 Go
vernments How would it strike us, 3f we should see other
great commercial nations acting up©n such a system? If Eng
land, with a revenue ÓT fifty millions s eriing a year were
found to be collecting and disbursing every shilling of it in
hard money, through all the ramificauons ofhet vast expendí
tuie, shojld we n it think her mad? But the system is werse
here, because it withdraw  just so much active capital from
the \\t> s of a country that requires capita!, and is paying mte
rest for capital wheieverit can obtain if
But n >w sir, allow me to examine the oppration of the mea
 ure upon the general mtetest of commerce, and upoi the ge
neral currency of thecountrv And in this point of view, the
Irst great question is What amount ol gold and silver will thia
operation subuact from the dictation of the co .m ry, and fiom
the use of the bank^i
In regard to this important inquiry, we ai not without the
means of lorming^ome judgment An official report from the
Treasuiy, mide to the o her ilouse, hows that, fo¡. the last ten
years, theie has bee i at the end of each jeai Orfanaveiace, fif

but which had not yet been by them paid to individuals Add

1 ve that farther ten yeai , he whole amoun., o silvei and

operation it would lo fc up, ai 1 keep locked up, one full hud
of ill tl e specie m the counti y I ocked up I say—hoarded—
rt n lered as useless to ai1 purposes of commtrce and bu'-me^s,
as if it weu tarried back to its native mines Sir is it not m
ceival le that an) man should fail upon such a scheme of po
h y a^ this? Is it pos^hle that any one can fail to see the de
s uictive effects of «mch a policy on the commerce and the
cutrency of the ountiy"*
It )<= true the «¡vtem does not come into operation all at once
líut it begrnfa it  d mands nr «pecie immediately, if calls up >n
thp bank  and it cabs upon individual^ for their hard dollars,
¡hat they maybe putaway and locked up, in the Tr s=ury at

omy peace, trust, confidence, that can restore the prosperity of
the country. This system of perpetual annoyance ^> the bardes,
this boarding up oí money which the eountry demands for its
own necessary usesjthis bringing of the whole revenue to act,
not in aid and furtherance, but m direct hindrance andemhar-
lassment of commerce and husmee*., jjs utteiiy irrecoocileaiile
with the public interest We shall pee no return of former
times till it be abandoned—altogether abandoned The passage
of this b II will create new alarm and new distress
People begin already to fear their own Government They
have an actual dreadof those who should be their protector 
and guardians There are hundredsof thousandsofhonestand
industrious men sir at this very moment, who woultt feel re-
lieved in their circumstances who would w;e abetter prospect
of an honest livelihood and feel moie sure of the means of fooá
and clothina foi their wives and children if they should hear
that this measure had received its death Let us, then, sir,
away with it Do we not see the world prosperous around usí
Do we not see other Governmen sand other nations, enlighten-
ed by expeuence, and rejecting arrogant innovations and the-
oretic dreams accomplishing the great ends of society'*
Why, sir, why are we why are wp aion*1 among the great
commercial States? Why are we to be kept on the rack and
torture of these e^peiiments? We have powers adequate,
complete powers We need only to exercise them, we need
only *o poiform our constitutional outy and we shalí spread
con em cheerfulness, and joy, over the whole land
Thi  brings rat, sir, to the ¡second inquiry
I-, thi;, measure Mi President, a just exercise of the powers
of Congi es  and does it fulfil all our dut est
Sir, I have so often discussed thw point I hi\ e so constancy
insisted foi saveral yt ars pa^t, on the constitutional obligation
ofCor-giess to take care of the currency, that the Senate must
be already tired of the speaker, if not weary of 'he topic, and
vet, after a'l, this 1 the i,r«-at a id paramount question Until
this is settled, the agitation can nevei be qn eted If we h<ive
not the power, wn must leave the whole subject m the bands of
th se who have it, or in no hand- but if we have the power,
wc are bound to ex ícise it, and e\ery dav'sneglect is a viola
ion of duty I theiefore again insist that we havethe powt r,
and I again pre s its exercise on the two Houses of Congress 1
again as ert that the regulation of tne general currency—of the
money of the country whatever actually constitutes that mo-
ney—is one of our solemn duties
The Constitution confers on us, sir, the exclusive power of
CGmage This moM have been done for the purpose of enabling
Congress to establish one uniform basis for the whole money
sjsem Congress, therefore, and Congress aione, has power
over the foundation, the groundwoik of the currency* and it
would be stiangeandanomalnu , having this, if it had nothing to
do wuhthestructure, the edifice, to be raised on this foundation*
Convertible paper wasalready in circulation when the Consti-
tution was fiamed and must have been expected to continue
and to increase But the c rculation of paper tends to dis-
p'ace coin it may banish it alueether at this very moment it
hxt- banished u If theitfoie, the power over the ce u does not
enabk Congiess to piiiect the om aid to restrain any íhtfig:
wh ch would &upeise ]e 1 and abo^sh its u^e, the whole power
becomes nugatory II otheis mav drive our the coin, and fill
the country with paper which d es not repre ent com, of what
use I beg to know, i  that exclusive power over coins and com
a^e which is given to Congress by the Constitut'on*
Gentlemen on the other Mde admit that it is the tendencyof
papei circulation toe*pel the torn 5 nt when they say, that, for
thaf very reason, they will withdiaw from all connection with
the geneial currency, and hmif themsehe  to the single and
nar*-ov object of pioiectmg the coin, and providing íbr pay
ments to Goveinment This seems to me to be a very strange
way of reasoning anda very strange course of political conduct
The cómase powei wa& given to be uwed for the benefit of the
whole '•ountry, and not merely o furnish a medium for the
collection ofie\enue The object was to secure for the gene-
ral use of the people, a sound and safe circulating medium.
Theie ca^ be no doubt of this intent If any evil arises, thieat
enmg to ue&tioyor endanger thia medium 01 this currency,
ojr du > is to meet it not to retreat from it to remedy it,not
to let 1 alone we are to contiol and correct the mischief not to
submit to it V\ ne evei paper is to circu'ate, as sub=* diary to
com, 01 as pet form ng m a greatei or less degree the function.
of co " it& reguiatioi naturally belongs to the hands which
ho'd the prvwer over the cómase Thi is an admitted maxim,
bv al writers it has been admitted and acted upon, on all ne-
ce arv occasions by cur own Government  throughout its
who e history Whv witl we now th rik oursehes wiser than
