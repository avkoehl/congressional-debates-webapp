Mahone's division and Cooke's brigade expected to move last night; stores and tobacco ordered out of Petersburg. Troops massed near Weldon railroad. Gracie's brigade ready to move at 9 a. m. to-day. Wagons heard all night between the Norfolk railroad and the plank road.

General Potter is ordered to open with artillery to endeavor to determine what they have left. Do you purpose moving your pickets?

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,February 24, 1865. (Received 10.50 a. m.)

Bvt. Major General A. S. WEBB,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

Fourteen deserters came in last night-seven from Heth's division, seven from Evan's. They know nothing of any movement being contemplated by the enemy. I don't think it best to advance my picket line, as I can take no position better for observation than my present one, there being a strip of woods between their works and any line I could take up.

NELSON A. MILES,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
