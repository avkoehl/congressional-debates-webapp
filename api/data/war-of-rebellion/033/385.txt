entirely to make the necessary disposition of the forces at your command. If any more troops are required to operate against Price, I will have to send Herron, who is now returning from an exhausting march from Yazoo City to Canton and return. The forces going from here will be provided with field transportation and artillery. It is probable, if any move is made against Price, Ord will go in command, but of this I am not yet certain.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

VICKSBURG, MISS., July 21, 1863.

General SCHOFIELD, Saint Louis, Mo.:

I will send one division to Helena to go after Price. I have no more troops here not worn out. I will send other troops to form the garrison, so as to relieve all the forces now at Helena.*

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
