line to move forward until we came out of action. Surgeon [Henry M.] McAbee, brigade surgeon, was detailed on the operating board at the division hospital. I found that a Merrill rifle, furnished one of my men by the division commander, reached the enemy's sharpshooters when none of our other guns seemed to have any effect on them, and would respectfully recommend that two companies of my brigade be armed with them. I inclose herewith the reports of the regimental commanders, and append a list of our killed, wounded, and missing:

On the morning of the 1st instant, our regiment, under the command of Colonel John Coons, was, with the brigade, under the command of Colonel S. S.
