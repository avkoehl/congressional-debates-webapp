The Tariff—Mr. Kerr.
Ho. of Reps.
Special outcry is made against the pending
bill by people who want to be supported in
affluence by forced alms because it makes
some reductions in present duties on iron and
steel, wool, and manufactures of wool, and
cotton fabrics. But these great industries
■were all vigorous and prosperous in 1860,
when the duties, as compared with those now
in force, were as follows :
Ad valorem, Ad valorem,
in 1860. in 1871.
Iron  24 45i
Iron, manufactures of...... 24 39}
Steel  15 42£
Steel, manufactures of.  24 43
Wool  24 46*
Wool, manufactures of  23? 79
Cotton, and manufactures of 22 40k
Average on all  225- 47.8
The increase on duty in 1860 is 114J per
cent.
There is now no tenable or just reason why
all these duties should not be reduced to a
fair and moderate, revenue standard. The
point at which they would produce the best
rewards for the revenue is not above twenty-
five per cent, ad valorem. At this rate, on
the basis of the imports of the last fiscal year,
tlie customs revenue would not be less than
$135,000,000 per annum. No more is needed.
We could now come down to this rate with
propriety and without any injustice. No indus-
try would suffer. No pursuit in our great
country needs more protection than it would
thus incidentally retain. That is what the
House ought now to do. There never was
in the history of our country, or in the condi-
tion of the whole world, a more auspicious
period for a speedy and mauly return to ra-
tional and honest fiscal policy. It can be now
effected without any shock or serious disturb-
ance to industry. The tendency in all rival
industrial and commercial countries abroad
is toward a great and continued increase in
the cost of production, and especially of all
those leading commodities, such as iron, steel,
woolens, cottons, and their innumerable man-
ufactured pioducts. There is also here and
every wtieie throughout Christendom an unpar-
alleled advance in the demand for and in the
consumption of all these great commodities.
Production cannot keep pace with demand.
Prices advance, the world over, and as fast
here as anywhere else, although the cost of
production and the rates of wages have not
advanced here so much as abroad by at least
thirty per cent, in the last year. The differ-
ence in the rates of wages, considering the
purchasing power of money in the different
countries, is not to-day in the industrial coun-
tries of Europe an average of thirty per cent,
below what the rates are here. Look at this
significant comparison, clipped from a pro-
tective paper, showing the advance in certain
articles m New York m a period of about two
months:

This is but the echo, the ready response in
this country, to the advance in prices abroad.
Since March 8 all these articles and all others
of' like general material and character have
still further advanced and are still advancing. I
have ample evidence at my hand here, and it
is common intelligence, that the agitations con-
cerning the interests of labor, and the amelio-
ration in its conditions abroad and the improve-
ment in its rewards, have for a year and a half
past been much more general, thorough, and
successful than during the same period here.
The commissioners of labor statistics for Mas-
sachusetts in their report for 1872 state that
throughout the different parts of Great Britain
fifty-six and a half hours per week may be
taken as a fair average in the leading employ-
ments, and that in Massachusetts the average
hours of labor per week are sixty-one and one
third. But my latest information fully satisfies
me that the average hours in Great Britain
do not exceed fifty-three per week.
It is a significant truth, too, that as the
hours of toil abroad have been shortened, the
productiveness of labor and its intelligence
have increased, and its wages have advanced.
It ought to be so in this country. Besides,
the natural protection enjoyed by this coun-
try over all its great competitors is at least
equal to twenty per cent, ad valorem on all
imports. The railroads of the world now
make nearly one hundred and twenty-five
thousand miles, sufficient to encircle the whole
earth in double bands of iron and steel five
times, and one half of this matchless growth
is in our own country. To supply the wants
in iron and steel of these great highways, and
also those of socity, of progress generally,
will give ample, constant, and remunerative
employment to all the productive capacity of
the people, and that, too, without a penuy of
protective bounty.
But the gentleman from Pennsylvania inti-
mated in his remarkable speech that the
advance in the prices of iron and steel, since
the tariff reduction on them of July 14, 1870,
is the result of that reduction. He also pre-
tends that the falling off in production last
year was caused by it. Are these things
true? "Who knows better than he that they are
not? The rebellion, the "strike" of his own
operatives in Pennsylvania against the refusal
of the iron-makers to give them in wages a mod-
erate and reasonable share of their munifi-
cent profits caused the diminished production.
The great demand throughout the world for
these products and the insufficient supply
caused the advance in prices. The tariff had
nothing to do with it. In a normal condition
of trade and business a reduction of duty will
invariably reduce prices. But if the gentle-
man believes his own theory, why does he not
at once demand a still further reduction in
duty in order to secure another advance in
price? Such assertions can deceive nobody.
The domestic manufactures of wool last
year were worth $176,000,000, of cotton
$170,000,000, and of iron and steel in their
primary forms from the furnaces, rolling-mills,
and forges of our country, $202,000,000, mak-
ing the total of all these products only
$548,000,000, about equal to the product of
the dairy alone. Yet the imported fabrics of
wool are charged with a duty which averages
seventy-nine per cent, ad valorem, and those
of cotton with forty and a half per cent., and
those of iron and steel with forty-three per
cent., the greater part of which tax is for pro-
tection alone, not revenue, and is therefore
unjust tribute, not honest taxation.
The pending bill proposes a reduction in
the duties on woolen goods of about twenty
per cent. It ought to be at least thirty-five
per cent.
This reduction on woolens and cottons is
considered by protectionists to be too great,
and in this objection it is understood tfiat the
gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Dawes]
concurs. But it is a significant lact that these
rates are not equaled elsewhere in a single
leading nation in the world. The duty on
cotton fabrics in this country in 1860 aver-
aged twenty-two per cent, ad valorem, and
now it is forty and a half; an inctease on the
duty in 1860 -of eighty-fotir per cent. The
duty on woolen fabrics in 1860 averaged
twenty-four per cent, ad valorem, and now is
seventy-nine; an increase on the duty in 1860
of three hundred and thirty-three per cent.
There is no good reason why these duties
should be higher now than they were in 1860.
Mr. Levi, in his instructive History of British
Commerce, 1763-1870, by a simple recital
of the progress toward freedom of exchange
made by some of the principal nations of
Europe between 1860 and 1870, puts us to
shame for our backward progress toward the
policy of commercial restrictions, monopoly,
and plunder. I will give the substance of his
statement in the following tabular form :

The bill proposes areduction of about twenty
per cent, in existing duties on imported wool,
making a reduction in the revenue from wool
of only $560,000. This reduction should be
very much greater than is proposed. Indeed, it
was a blunder ever to impose a duty on raw
wool. It was never beneficial to wool-growers,
the farmers, or the country. It is a product
of agriculture that can only be cursed by "pro-
tection." Its imposition originally was the
result of cunning strategy on the part of pro-
tectionists, and was designed chiefly to increase
the number of their confederates. The im-
ports of wool of all kinds in the last fiscal
year were worth $9,906,031. The duty aver-
aged over forty-five per cent, ad valorem,, and
yielded to the revenue $4,515,103. Wool is
free in Great Britain, France, and Belgium.
The duty in Prussia is very low, and it does
not approximate ours in any foreign nation.
During the agitation for its freedom in those
countries, the most melancholy predictions
were indulged in by the protectionists and the
wool-growers. None of them were ever real-
ized ; the production of wool increased, prices
advanced, the quality and variety improved,
and the farmers and woolen manufacturers
became more prosperous. No protectionist
in those countries now advocates a retilrn to
a tariff on wool.
The history of the wool husbandry in our
country demonstrates that, as in all other
countries, the culture has been most prosper-
ous and best rewarded when wool has been
free of duty, The manufacture of woolens
under free trade in raw wool has also been
most vigorous, skillful, and prosperous. The
latter needs, for successful development, diver-
sity of products, and skill, the utmost variety
in raw wools. Wool is greatly affected by cli-
mate, soil, and latitude in its qualities and
excellences. No single country can or ever
did supply the raw wools for successful and
diversified woolen manufacture. _ Besides, it is
now a conceded fact that there is a scarcitv in
all grades of wool throughout the world. The
woolen machinery now in existence cannot
find sufficient supplies of wool to keep it em-
ployed. The manufacturers are anxious to
find substitutes for the pure fiber. Hence the
extensive use of shoddy and cotton. Mr. Atkin-
son very truly says '1 that the import of foreign
wool does not work competition with the do-
mestic wool-grower, but rather cooperation."
The mixing of needed foreign wools with
