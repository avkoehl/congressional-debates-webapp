Ten thousand sets accouterments were issued for these arms from Allegheny Arsenal on April 29. Captain Whittemore has similar orders as Captain Bradford so far as regards Indiana troops.

Five thousand Enfield muskets and accouterments were issued to Governor Yates from Detroit Arsenal on April 28, and 200,000 cartridges for these arms were ordered from Indianapolis Arsenal on April 22. Lieutenant Arnold has been pondered from Saint Louis Arsenal to Springfield, Ill., with similar instructions as the other two officers. Most of the foregoing stores should have reached their destination by this time.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. D. RAMSAY,

Do you think it advisable to proceed to draft in the deficient subdistricts of your State, so that all of them shall thus be made to fill the guotas heretofore assigned? Please answer by telegraph.

Operator send similar dispatch to Governor Kirkwood, Des Moines Iowa.
