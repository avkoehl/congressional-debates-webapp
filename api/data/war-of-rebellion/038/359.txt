The following dispatch has just been received:
HEADQUARTERS THIRTEENTH ARMY CORPS

May 28, 1863.

GENERAL: My scouts have just returned, with a vague report of 400 or 500 rebel it better for you to be placed on your guard. If they have crossed (which I don't believe), a raid is intended somewhere.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,JOHN J. MUDD,

Colonel and Chief of Cavalry.

The general directs, if you have not already done so, that you throw out pickets on the right flank, to extend around to the Hall's Ferry road.

By order of Brigadier-General Lauman:

W. H. F. RANDALL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major-General GRANT, near Vicksburg:

GENERAL: The inclosed letter I had written to be sent to you at the moment yours of the 25th was presented to me by Colonel Riggin. I regret it does not find me in condition to go to your support with all my force. Without abandoning Port Hudson altogether, it will be impossible for me to do so, and then the aid I can give you must be very little.

My force is far less than you imagine, and, with such detachments from it as would be necessary to protect New Orleans, while Port Hudson, Mobile, and Kirby Smith are within a few days' movement of New Or-
