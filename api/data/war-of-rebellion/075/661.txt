Lieutenant General L. POLK:

The President directs, in consequence of the movements of the enemy in front of General Johnston (concentrating his forces from North Alabama), that you move with Loring's division, and any other available force at your command, to Rome, Ga., and there unite with General Johnston to meet the enemy. Major General S. D. Lee will command in your department, and you will send to him the needful instructions for that purpose.

Adjutant and Inspector General.

Lieutenant-General POLK,

Demopolis, Ala.:

Can you not send Loring's division to Rome immediately? I have every reason to believe that his assistance may be of vital importance at the earliest moment at which he can get into that position. If you have a brigade nearer to Rome, send it, I entreat you, in advance of Loring.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

DALTON, May 4, 1864.

General POLK:

I thank you for your prompt attention to my request.

J. E. JOHNSTON.
