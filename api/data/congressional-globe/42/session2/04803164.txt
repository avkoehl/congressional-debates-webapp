THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 7,
soldiers should have a knowledge of the clean-
ing, repairing, and manufacture of arms, and
if they can be put to work there, as they have
been in many prisons, they can save the Gov-
ernment thousands and tens of thousands of
dollars a year by the work they perform as
hands in the armory and arsenal. Men will
acquire in that time very considerable skill in .
any trade, and the committee believe that
Rock Island will be as suitable a place as any
in the United States, as far as locality and
position is concerned, and so far also as cheap-
ness of labor and materials arc concerned in
building the prison. And supplies also for
feeding and clothing the men can be procured
there certainly as cheaply as in any part of the
United States. There is no appropriation in
the bill. All that we ask now is that a law
be passed providing for the establishment of
the prison.
I offer the letter of the Adjutant General
and the accompanying table to show the num-
ber, location, &c., of our Army prisoners:
Adjutant General's Office,
Washington, January 26,1872.
Silt: In reply to your communication of the 22d
instant, addressed to tho honorable Secretary of "War
I respectfully inclose herewith a statement showing
the number of prisoners confined at hard labor in
penitentiaries under sentence of general courts-
martial, tho length of their terms of confinement,
and the rates charged for maintaining them; also
statement showing the number of general prisoners
confined at military posts.
This comprises all the data that can be obtained
from the records of this office, and does not embrace
the number of prisoners confined in guard-houses
at small military posts, which can only be obtained
by a voluminous correspondence with officers sta-
tioned at the several military posts throughout the
country.
Of the military posts enumerated, Fort Columbus
New York harbor, Fort Pulaski, Georgia, and Alca-
traz Island, California, are designated as depots for
the concentration of general prisoners in the local-
ities where they are situated.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
E. D. TOWNSEND, Adj. den.
Hon, John Cobukn, Chairman Committee on Military
Affairs, House of Representatives.
