Brevet Brigadier-General Hamblin, commanding Second Brigade, First Division, who entered Petersburg with his command at an early hour this morning saw Roger A. Pryor, who told him that he had seen General Lee within two days, and that he is very bitter and disposed to fight it out to the last. Would it not be well to have Pryor examined by some competent person? It is also reported that the enemy have formed line about five miles from Petersburg, on the Richmond road.
