HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,September 15, 1863.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Second Army Corps:

GENERAL: Major-General Pleasonton desires me to say to you that General Kilpatrick reports that the enemy have received heavy re-enforcements; that there has been cheering and bands playing to-night. You can hear the rumbling of artillery and trains. You had better have your corpus here by daylight, for they could make a crossing with their infantry in the morning against the force we could bring against them, as we have such a long line to protect and they have the railroad bridge to cross upon.

C. ROSS. SMITH,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Chief of Staff.

SEPTEMBER 15, 1863-10 p. m.

Commanding Officer Cavalry Corps:

What reason have you for supposing the enemy will attempt to drive you back with infantry? I am not yet prepared to move the whole army forward, awaiting instructions from Washington, but if you have reason to believe, or have any evidence that Lee will cross the Rapidan to give me battle between the two rivers, it would prove his having a greater force than we have supposed, and would militate against the retrograde movement.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.
