APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April, 1840.
36th Cong*" 1st. Sbss.
Appropriation Bill—Ah. McKay.
H. of Reps.
Aad it must not be forgotten that there was
another circumstance which had done much to
mislead the public mind on this subject. In the
last Congress, the House of Representatives had
ordered the publication of an extra number of
copies of documentsNos. Ill and 297, each present-
ing a very unfair view of the matters to which
they related. The first. No. Ill, contained the names
of all collecting and deposite officers who were in
default, including all whose accounts were un-
settled on the books of the Treasury, whether from
accident, death, informality in vouchers, or actual
indebtedness. The second, 297, which was most
extensively citcutated, contained copies of all let-
ters written by the Secretary of the Treasury to
collectors and receivers,having reference not only
to defalcations, but to omissions to comply with the
laws and regulations established for their govern-
ment, an d other irregularities. .None of the Utters
received from the officers, offering reasons for tkt irre-
guUritie* mni delays complained of by the Department,
were given, «* tAey were not called for by the ttmu of
tie r etotvtiew, and thus, by this one sided correspond-
enee, faithful public officers were reported as de-
faulters.   Bat enough of this.
Let us resume an examination of the purposes to
which the money in the Treasury had been applied.
He had already said that Congress alone contó ap-
propriate. A great deal had been said in this de-
bate about the estimates annually sent in by the Se-
cretary of the Treasury, as fixing the responsibility
of either Congress or the Executive, in regard to
the amount of appropriations. The estimates were
nothing more than mere statements of the sums
of money, which, in the opinions of the heads of the
several departments, would be required for the
branches of the public service entrusted to their
management, commonly providing pay for the em-
ployees of the Government, and the purposes au-
thorized by existing laws. Nothing can be inferred
from the fact that the appropriations exceed the
estimates. On recurrence to onr past history, it
will be found that this has been usually the case,
and it would be strange if it were not S3. For as
Congress alone can appropriate, it is unquestiona-
bly a part of that power to designate the objects
to which the appropriations shall be made. It is
customary to confine the estimates to purposes au-
thorized by law, or which had before, in some form
or other, received the sanction of Congress. It is
true that the Executive may include in them appro-
priations for new objects, or the recommendations
of the Executive may, if adopted, render additional
appropriations necessary; or if from any cause the
public moneys, after being appropriated, are either
wasted or misapplied, in all such cases the Execu-
tive is clearly responsible for any increase in the
expenditures, which may be ihus occasioned. He
had no wish, of course, to see the appropriations
go beyond the estimates. Yet be mast protest
agiinit the doctrine uttered here by some grntle-
men, that tbey will not vote any money, unless it
is asked for by the Executive. The practical effect of
that doctrine would be to concede to the Execu-
tive all power over the purse of the country; at
any rate, to give to him the initiation of all mo-
ney bills.
Why, sir, the gentleman firm Pennsylvania,
[Mr. Bids ,] a few days ago, when a motion was
pending before the Hon*e for the committal of ihe
bill from the Senate making an appropriation for
the removal of ihe raft in the Red river, argu ed
with great ingenuity, that the Senate could not ori-
ginate an appropriation bill; while others say that
even this House must not appropriate, unless the
money is asked for by the Executive. Tney have
not, it is true, used such language, but such are the
consequences that would flow from the doctrines
they maintain.
There is another aspect in which these estimate*
aust be viewed, in order to judge rightly the re-
sponsibility of the Executive in making them, and
which will also shed some light on the canses of
the inciease in onr annual expenditures. These
estimates vary from year to year, and from canses
either of a permanent or temporary kind. In the
first place, they are affected by the legislation of
Congress. For example: In the year 1832, an act
iras passed, authorizing tbf employment of a re-
1819.   For expenditures under 1st head,  - $158 72
"              «          "      2d    "       -   275 98
Reduced from-1818,
$434 70
16 87
1820.   For expenditures under 1st rlead,  - $140 45
«            '«              «    2d   "            175 04
giment of mounted men. Of course, in the next
year, the estimates of the Secretary of War would
have to be increased to an amount sufficient for
the pay, subsistence, &c. of the new corps. And
the ssme remark will apply to the acts subsequently
passed, making additions to the army. In the year
1835, the pay of the naval officers was increased.
In the next year, the Secretary of the Navy would
have to increase his estimates for the pay of the
navy accordingly. Another case: Congress passes
an act directing the building of several new light-
houses, in different parts of the Union. "When
this is done, it is obvious that the annual charge
for the maintenance of the light-house establish-
ment will be increased, as rther keepers must be
employed, and more lamps, oil, «fee. will be required.
These additional charges will continue in the esti-
mates until Congress changes its laws creating
them. Take another case of a temporary charac-
ter: Congress directs the building of a custom-
house at New York, Boston, or other port, or com-
mences the Treasury, Patent, or Post Office build-
ing, in this city. Now, in all these cases, unless
the first appropriations were large enough, addi- \
tional ones will be asked for in the estimates, until i
the buildings are finished, when these items will no '
longer appear in them.
Again: the pnblic expenditures may be divided
into two classes; first, those not affected by adminis-
tration, such as the salaries of officers, &c. pen- ,
sions, &c. fixed bv law; second, those which are '
constantly affected" by administration, depending not '
only upon the capacity and fidelity oí the public f
agents, but also upon the state of the markets, &c.
This latter class is a numerous one, and it is in this
that there has been a large increase. Take, for ex-
ample, the subsistence of the army and navy.
Flour, beef, pork, &c. have to be purchased for their
use. Do not all, at once, see that the amount of
appropriation for this purpose will be regulated, in
a great degree, by the prices at which those various
articles can be purchased, and that those prices are
constantly fluctuating'! The same remark may be
applied to the timber that has to be procured for the
gradual improvement of the navy; to the materials
whieh enter into the construction of our fortifica-
tions, arsenals, and other public buildings,
and the labor employed upon them; the cost
of all, of course, depending upon the mar-
ket value of the materials and labor. He would
not pause to inquire into the causes of this fluc-
tuation in prices. He was aware that therjs were
many, and not the least potent among them was the
state of the currency, the prices of almost every
thing rising or falling with its expansions and con-
tractions. Be the cause what it may, the effect was
the same, in producing, when the prices were high,
a corresponding increase in the expenditures. The
following table* will show the variations in the prices
of beef, pork and flour, as ascertained from the
prices paid for those articles, as component parts of
the army and navy rations; and every one must ob-
serve that the prices were highest when the
currency was known to be most inflated; for
instance, in the years 1836, 1837, and 1838.
The first part of the table exhibits the ave-
rage prices paid on account of the navy ration at
the three stations of Boston, New York, and Nor-
folk. The other part of the table shows the
prices of the same articles, as component parts of
the army ration at New Orleans, New York, and
Boston.
In further proof of what he had said, he would
refer to a table prepared in 1822, showing the ave-
rage cost per annum of each officer and soldier of
the army, including the academic staff and cadets,
from the year 1818 to 1822, inclusive, calculated
upon the average strength of the army in 1818, and
the actual expenditures in each year:

nistration, -                                   $151 93

It will be seen that there was some reduction in
1819; and, continuing in 1820 and 1821, the average
cost in the latter year was $160 55 less than in 1818
—which would make a very material difference ia
the annual expense of maintaining an army of any
strength. Now, it may be true, that some of this
reduction was owing to the improved administra-
tion of the War Department about that period; yet
it is believed that more of it was produced by the
commercial revulsion which commenced in the early
part of 1819. Mr. Crawford, in his celebrated re-
port of February, 1820, estimated that the circula-
tion of the country in 1813 amounted to seventy mil-
lions, and that in 1816 it had risen to $110,000,000;
and he then remarks: "Such an increase will be
followed by a general rise in the value of all arti-
cles, especiallv of those which, cannot be exported,''
