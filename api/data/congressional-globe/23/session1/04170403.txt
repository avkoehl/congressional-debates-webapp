refuse to bow submission to their opinions There
is no power on earth that can withstand their in-

L^'in maxim winch he had often heard quoted by
those who had a knowledge of that iangudgi, the

ev°i their declarations and professions, when they

advocate the prmcip'es of the vvorkmgmen, at a
time when it seemed tl at the bank had putchused
the liberies of the people, so fu as individuals
could be found to sell themselves, and had foiled
otheis by tl e exeieise of hei all-contro,lmg influ-
ence, to bow submission to hei mandates, it w 
(he said) gri'ifyi'ig to hts feelings tofnd, when
opposed, abused, peisecuted, and nullified by the

blind fo'loweis of men disies; id'nj; pnrcip'e and

Puohc meetings ( Vli P said) had been held by
the people, in diíTeient paits of the State, got up
by 'he aristociats, the national republicans, nul i-
fiers, tauffites, and those indebted to the bank,
denouncing the Admimstia'ion and its couiseon

delegation. False lepresentations have been mide

A few weeks ago, the most of the leading poli-
ticians of the State had taken a stand in opposition
to the coulee puisued by thePfesident, or seemed
to neonate on which side to enlist, whether on the
side of trie people oi the bank. But one man
among the liteiati of the State (he sa.d) had had
the firmness and independence to encourage him
to stand fiim m thecourse hehad taken during the
piesent session, and the office ho! ("is-and man-
woislnppeis had even succeeded in destroving the

intended tor the public eye, it accoided so well
i with  his own opinions, that he could not lefram
fiom leading some extiacts therefrom, believing,
as he did, that it spoke the language of the work-
nigmen oi old Beikshire.    Mr. P. then read thp
followmgextiacts:
" Permit me to íeturn you my sincere thanks
'foi the favors shown in sending me publicdocu-
' merits It has furnished me wifh some ínterest-
' irg intelligence, which I could not otherwise
' have obtame 1 You will excuse me for the lib—
' eity I take 1 am neithera writer nor apoluician;
' that you know by my writing. Thereforeil would
' not become n.e, as a plain iaimer, or a laboring
' man, to vvn'e to a gentlemarFm the Congress of
' the United States, giving my views on any par-
' ticular subject which they have in their trust.
' But Having confidence, su, that you will make
' allowance foi my mauilities, and not expose
' thtm, I will give a few ideas of my own, how-
' evei they may diffei fiom any one else. I have
'just lead the Piesident's protestagamst the usur-
' pation of the Senate. It is noble, patriotic; like
'all other of his writings, worthy of the highest
' place in the pages of our history. I am not mas-
I ' ter enough of language to give it the exalted sta-
1 tion it meats That, together with the veto,
1 ought to be engraved m laige letters of gold, and
' laised so high m the heavens that it can be read
I ' by every individual that inhabits this globe. I
I 'have lead a small pamphlet whicti was sent to
' my fuend, pi etendmg to prove that credit is pre-
1 ' ferable to coin. When our farmers read any-
[ ' thing that is trying to substitute paper or credit
I 'in place of gold and silver, there is a kind of m-
' action and gloom upon then faces, which renders
' them very unpleasant. But when theyread of a
'scaeme that will do away small bank notes, and
'substitute specie in their stead, there seems to be
'a lively action, and their-countenances are like
' the spung-blossoms after a long winter.
" People in this place, I think I may safely say,
' aie getting moie and more in favor of the meas-
' ures pursued by the Piesident in relation to the
' bank His most bitter enemies say they do not
'hke so powerful an institution as that of Mr.
' Biddle's bank, and that it ought not to exist any
' longer, but do not wish that Piesident Jackson
'should have the honoi of pulling it down under
'his Admintstiation. As I Yiew the subject, I
' hope and implore the goodness of Almighty God
'that so powerful, overbearing, and coirupt an
' institution, that cm give into the hands of a small
' class of people the powet, as well as influence,
' to di tiess a whole nation, might in this ou- day
' be puiged fiom oui Republic If those are not
' your views, pel nut me, sir, as you have abetter
' opportunity to form a more correct knowledge of
'the subjec, to ask of you to give me a slight
i ' view, by way of lettei.
|     " Perhaps, sir, you may think I take a great
'mteiestin this bank concern for a man in my
'capacity and occupation of life     I certainly do.
' There has never been, since 1816, in my opinion,
'a subject brought up  before the people of the
1 ' United States that ought to wakeup and call the
1 ' attention  of every individual citizen like this.
