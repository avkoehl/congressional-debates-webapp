discount, the Virginia banks, even those which
weie reported dead, only about two pel cent dis-
count, and the pet bank of tnis Distuct—the Me-
tropolis—which had been the subject ot so many
melancholy piedictions, was at the rate of one per
cent discount, and no more1 All is going on well,
(said Mr B ) It was nearly "ihe last of pea time"
with distress memorials, and as the cry of distress
began in the Senate, he presumed it would end m
the Senate, and that, henceforth, nothing more
would be heard than the faint and lingering ac-
cents of dying out an exanimate alarm
Mr. HENDRICKS repelled the idea that the
memorial which he had just presented to the Sen-
ate had been produced in any degree by the panic
which pervades the country, or that it had been
gotten up for political effect The people of Swit
Serland county were not panic makers, nor were
they more halle to alaim from danger at a distance
than the people of other portions of the Union In
this instance he believed they were much less
liable to alarm than many others They stated
facts connected with their own business The
produce business, in which many of them aie
engaged, is deeply affected by the distracted and
depressed condition of the currency They see, and
they feel, and they cannot be mistaken in the facts
they state He had refened, when up befoie, to
the condition of the New Orleans maiket, to the
fact that bankiuptcies, unpaialleled in number and
extent, had taken place in that commerci il city,
and that it was believed the means of leeuvmg and
paying for the produce of the upper countiy was
not to be found there In that refeience he had
allusion, among other things, to a letter wh ch he I
had seen in the hands of a ¡senator on the floor, |
and such information was generally more to be
relied on than the prices curient That lettei did j
speak of unparalleled failures in that city, and that
mfoimation accorded well with the experience of
many who had recently been engaged in the pio
dure business on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers
Mi EL i epeated that this memorial had not been
gotten up for political effect He would remind
the Senate of a remark hehaJ made when fust up,
that the memorial was signed indiscriminately by
men of all parties He would ventuie the assei-
uon,that there weie many names on that paper of
peisons as waimly devoted to the piesent Chief
Magistrate and his Admimstiation, as any indi-
vidual within the sound of his voice, men who,
although they disappi ove of the removal of the
deposites, and ot the measuies which have pto-
duced the piesent state of things, yet have undi-
minished confidence in ti e puuty and integrity of
the motives wmch induce I tne meisuie—men
who indulge m no denu iciations, who believe the
President of the United States to be an honest
man, an aident pat lot, and one who would make,
for the peipetuity of our fiee institutions, ¡.s gieet
sacrifices as any otuer It is not for political effect
that such men make such staten et ts as are con
tamed in the memori il just piesented All then qp-
