Here, then, is an interest of the greatest
importance paralyzed to the extent which these
figures show. No man will dispute it. It has
been worse neglected than any other interest I
of our people. It was broken down first when
the war of the rebellion broke out. American
commerce was inevitably more exposed to dis-
aster, to ruin, and destruction when the war
came than any other. Our ships were found
upon all the seas of the world. And when the
rebel cruisers stole out from southern ports, so
sensitive is commerce that for every vessel
that was sunk by the Alabama or the Sumter
or the Florida, a degree of fear and dismay
spread through business circles which can in
no degree be measured by the actual loss to our
commerce from the captures by these cruisers.
What was done at the time for this interest
when beginning to suffer in that way, to suffer
by direct acts of the enemy with whom we were
contending ? Could Congress do anything to
help this? It may be that it conld not; at all
events it did not. Meanwhile, sir, as a result
of the war and as a result of the sympathy
which Great Britain showed for the South, the
extreme protective feeling took rapid strides
in this country. All our industrial interests
except ship-building and commerce came to
the doors of Congress and clamored for in-
creased protection. Men's minds were then
in condition to yield about all that was asked
when an appeal was made against the compe-
tition of England.
I sympathized at that time with this feeling;
Congress acted upon it. What was the result?
Every leading industry of the country had in-
creased protection. Our iron forges and man-
ufactories blossomed out into increased pros-
* In the year 1852, #4,648,587, and in 1854, $3,068,287, were imported into San Francisco; class of vessels in
wbieh brought cannot be stated.
perity. Our railroads had their lines of trade
filled to overflowing. The banks in the hands
of moneyed men have coined money to an ex-
tent that had never been known in the history ;
of finance before. But while these interests !
were thus being helped and sustained by the !
Government, the dominant party enacting and
the minority not expostulating, yon cannot lav
your finger on any acts of Congress by which
help has been afforded to American ship-build-
ing or American commerce. Nay, sir, more
than this; there has been nothing done from
the day when the war ended and we settled
back into peace and the encouragement of
peaceful industries; year after year has gone
by and the attention of men's minds has been
more and more brought to material interests,
bringing out, as I hope it will, more and more
of that kind of practical statesmanship that is
to-day found in the British House of Com-
mons. One interest existed in this nation
which was left unnoticed. For the last ten
years there has been no actionby the Ameri-
can Congress recognizing the importance of
American ship-building and American com-
merce, and that of itself ought to draw every
man's mind with fixed attention to this sub-
ject. It is disgraceful that it is so, that an
interest in which our national pride as well as
our prosperity is legitimately interested should
have thus been given the go-by.
Now, the Committee on the Decline ot
American Tonnage has labored faithfully during
the months of the last recess, and has reported
bills here which it believes will afford reason-
able help. I have not time to discuss m detail
the provisions of those bills. ; What, in brief,
they propose to do is to takeoff practically the
duties from ship-building materials, as is done,
I believe, in every other country, to afford help
in the way of bounties, and to give subsidies in
certain instances. This is in brief the prac-
tical effect of the bills. It is Government aid,
of course. It is protection pure and simple.
I presume that the bills do not suit everybody.
There are things about them that do not suit
me. I would be glad to have the tonnage tax,
in which men in my district are interested, on
small vessels of little value taken off. I hope
and expect the Committee of Ways and Means
will see that that is done, as I know that they
have a bill prepared to that effect. But because
of that I do not choose to antagonize this bill,
which has a broader and more national interest,
besides being of real interest to my own imme-
diate constituents.
Now, what do gentlemen propose ? It is said
by some that this bill will not accomplish its
purpose, and therefore they cannot vote for it.
Does any gentleman making this objection, with
the exception of the gentleman from Massachu-
setts, propose anything in its stead? Have not
the arguments that have been adduced here and
that I have so imperfectly stated, showing the
condition of affairs, settled affirmatively in the
minds of this House that Something should bo
done? And may we not trust something to the
ability and faithfulness of the men upon this
committee who report the results of their delib-
erations? Let us make the experiment in some
direction.
But there are not a few gentlemen who go
further in bolder opposition to this bill and
find a remedy in the introduction, by pur-
chase, of foreign vessels. Open our naviga-
tion, they say, to the competition of the world
in furnishing ships. Let our capital be aggre-
gated ; let it be invested in vessels built abroad
i and brought here. Now, sir, I have something
to say upon this subject, for I am interested
i in it, as the district which I have the honor to
I represent is interested in it. That district em-
; braces the entire eastern half of the sea-board
\ of Maine. It formerly bnilt sailing vessels of
i every size and model. To-day it builds, but
to a much lesser extent. We cannot afford to
enter into competition with the ship-builders
I of the province of New Brunswick.
It may be said in answer to this that we
build mainly for the coastwise trade, which is
■ absolutely shut against foreign competition.
I But let me ask this question: if you allow our
citizens to buy foreign-built vessels, excluding
their use in the coastwise trade, how long will
it be before those same men, buying vessels
abroad, will come here and say, '4 We are like
other citizens of the Republic ; we made our
money legitimately; we nave invested it in for-
eign vessels, being so permitted by law. These
vessels are now American vessels, and we ask
what right or justice is there in excluding
those vessels from any branch of the Ameri-
can trade?" Yon could not resist their argu-
ment, and the entire commerce of the country
would be carried on in bottoms of foreign
make.
New Brunswick, where labor is cheap, and
where lumber and. materials are cheaper than
with us  would prosper anew at our expense.
More than that, capital would not aggregate
itself to advantage to go abroad. With us, in
scores of cases every year, vessels are bnilt
without ready money by men combining their
capital for the purpose. They unite together,
build vessels, and send them out upon the sea.
Allow foreign competition* and theseraen could
not accumulate money, enough to enable them
to go abroad and huy Veisels.
I know a sad instance which occurred in my
own distriet. In oneof the sea-board towns a
little vessel .Waa built and sent out upon'the
seas, and upon her first voyage she went to the
bottom wita all on . board, and when the roll
waa made up it was found that of the thirteen
men on that little vessel seven' were owners,
who had helped to build her and helped toman
her. Thjey built her by their own labor, and she
