HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE, Knoxville, June 17, 1863.

Brigadier General J. PEGRAM,Commanding Brigade:

GENERAL: The enemy is making a strong demonstration against Big Creek Gap. General Gracie has been ordered to that point, and General Frazer to Jacksborough. Major-General Buckner approves of the disposition which you have made of your forces, but requests you to take your headquarters at Wartburg, watch the movements of the enemy from there, and operate, as much as circumstances will permit, on his rear and flank. Colonel [John S.] Fain's Georgia regiment has been ordered from Wartburg to Jacksborough or Clinton.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

V. SHELIHA,

Chief of Staff.

RICHMOND, June 18, 1863.

General BRAXTON GRAGG,

Shelbyville, Tenn.:

Dispatch from General Johnston, dated yesterday at Jackson, states: General Ruggles telegraphs credited information from Corinth; Federals contemplate attacking Atlanta with 4,000 cavalry from Corinth.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

KNOXVILLE, June 18, 1863.

General S. COOPER:

My cavalry and General Bragg's are co-operating at Monticello. The withdrawal of General Bragg's cavalry without notice to me greatly exposed Pegram. He repulsed the enemy, but being too weak to hold the country alone, he is falling back to Wartburg. I will co-operate cheerfully with General Bragg. The enemy to-day are making a strong demonstration against Big Creek Gap.* I am concentrating to meet him. I returned from Cumberland Gap yesterday.

S. B. BUCKNER,

Major-General.
