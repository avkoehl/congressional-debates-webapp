NEW BERNE SIGNAL STATION, May 7, 1864-9.35 a.m.

Colonel McCHESNEY:

I think one company is enough to scout toward Evans' Mill. The other should be sent toward Pollocksville.

AMORY,

Colonel.

STATION No. 1, May 7, 1864-11.30 a.m.

Colonel SAVAGE:

Do you desire or require the four companies One hundred and fifty-eighth New York Infantry, Lieutenant-Colonel McNary commanding, any longer at Rocky Run, or on your side of the front? If not, they will be recalled. If you do desire to keep them, state for how long.

P. J. CLAASSEN,

Colonel, Commanding Outposts.

CAMP PALMER, May 7, 1864-12 m.

Colonel CLAASSEN:

I do desire to keep them for the present. I cannot say for how long, but which some slashing and digging to be done.

JAS. W. SAVAGE,

Colonel Twelfth New York Cavalry.

STATION No. 1., May 7, 1864-12.40 p.m.

Colonel SAVAGE:

MY DEAR COLONEL: I should be happy to accommodate you, but I am sure you will not ask it when I tell you that the One hundred and thirty-second is two days on and one day off duty, besides scouting, &amp;c. Please, therefore, send two of the companies, each 2 officers, to the Red House before sunset to-day to relieve the One hundred and thirty-second now here. The other two companies you can keep for a few days, if you want them.

I am, &c.,

P. J. CLAASSEN,

Colonel, Commanding Outposts.

CAMP PALMER, May 7, 1864-1.20 p.m.

Colonel CLAASSEN:

MY DEAR COLONEL: I was not aware but that your force was so small. The two companies will, of course, be removed as you desire at once to the Red House.

JAS. W. SAVAGE,

Colonel Twelfth New York Cavalry.
