HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS, September 28, 1864-11 a.m. (Received 11.12 a.m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have just seen two deserters from Eighth Georgia Cavalry, who give important information about the enemy extending his intrenchments southwesterly from Petersburg. They were stationed at Poplar Spring Church. They are building works on Mr. Peebles' farm and how far south they do not know, and think there is a considerable infantry force in that direction, pretty thick, they say they are, and we would lose a good many men in getting them away. I send the men up at once.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, September 28, 1864-11.45 a.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I send up four contrabands from near Reams' Station and a negro woman who left Petersburg a week ago. She says all the rich people have been for three or four weeks moving to Richmond to get where there was less danger and more necessaries of life. They none of them know much of importance to us.
