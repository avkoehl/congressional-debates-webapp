HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, January 9, 1865.

Colonel HARDING,

Kansas City:

Had not a company ought to be posted on railroad at crossing of Little Blue?

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

KANSAS CITY, January 9, 1865-3. 40 p. m.

General DUDGE,

Saint Louis:

The crossing of the Little Blue is six miles south of Independence. There ought to be troops there to range from a fixed camp. I have scarcely men enough to send another company out, but probably will have in two days. I have to keep out a pretty strong force from Hickman Mills to Independence, and to furnish a large guard here, besides doing the necessary fatigue duty. Little Santa Fe, the Mission, and other posts on the border have been abandoned by the Kansas troops previously stationed there. I have had to garrison Westport. If I had control of the company at Independence and those at Pleasant Hill I believe that I could make a successful drive.

CHESTER HARDING, JR.,

Colonel, Commanding Forty-third Missouri Volunteers.

KANSAS CITY, January 9, 1865.

Colonel JOHN F. PHILIPS:

Your company of cavalry arrived. I sent them to Westport for headquarters. Will operate in conjunction with my men, and can do much good. No further information concerning Shelby's men, and believe the report false.

CHESTER HARDING, JR.,

Colonel, Commanding.
