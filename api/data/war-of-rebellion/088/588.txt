Major-General ORD,

Headquarters Eighteenth Corps:

I think it would not be advisable to attempt to drive them from that position. General Paine has not enough troops to hold it permanently if he obtains it, and it is not of much importance anyway. His defensive works can easily be held with his strength, but it might be fatal to attempt offensive movement.

Respectfully,

PETER S. MICHIE,

First Lieutenant, U. S. Engineers.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT,August 29, 1864. (Received 11.25 a. m.)

General PAINE,

Commanding, Deep Bottom:

You need not drive the enemy from Ammon's house. It is not of sufficient importance for you to give the enemy the defensive and take the offensive with your limited command. Besides it is too far from your line to hold it should you take it. Lieutenant Michie, engineer, will ride to your headquarters this p. m. to explain the ground around you.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

Major READ,

Assistant Adjutant-General, General Ord's Headquarters:

The earth-work is distant at least two miles from battery at Crow's Nest, and at least a mile and a quarter from the position at Dutch Gap. It can therefore do us no great injury. We cannot prevent its erection without occupying the ground ourselves, which would take a large force, say 2,000 men, to do. I believe that the enemy are simply making a strong defensive line of works on the ridge from Cox's Ferry to Three-Mile Creek, which we occupied some two weeks ago and afterward abandoned.

PETER S. MICHIE,

First Lieutenant, U. S. Engineers.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,August 29, 1864.

Colonel ABBOT:

A detail of 100 men has been ordered to report to you from Tenth Connecticut Volunteers.

Major, &amp;c.
