Lieutenant-General POLK:

Enemy's cavalry, estimated at 2,200, came within nine miles of this place this morning. Has delayed my, movement to Calhoun. Will leave Ross' brigade and go with the other two to Calhoun, if you think proper. I am at your orders.

W. H. JACKSON,

ROME, May 15, 1864.

Brigadier-General MACKALL:

Enemy's cavalry, estimated at 2,200, made his appearance nine miles from here. Have driven in my pickets. General Jackson is here with three brigades. He will leave one here and go with the other two to Calhoun. He could with his division, by operating from here on the other side of the river, do great damage to the enemy.

H. B. DAVIDSON,

Brigadier-General.

RESACA, May 15, 1864.

Brigadier-General JACKSON,

Rome, Ga.:

GENERAL: You have been ordered previously to move your cavalry to Calhoun immediately. The enemy is understood to have thrown a force across the river at Tanner's and Dobbin's Ferry, on the Oostenaula River, below Calhoun. Our trains are moving from Resaca, via Calhoun, to Kingston; throw yourself in between the line of march of our trains and the enemy. Connect Rome, through your headquarters with mine, at once, by couriers.

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.
