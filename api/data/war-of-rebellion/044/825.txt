Major-General DIX, Commanding Department:

GENERAL: The roads were so heavy and the weather so warm this morning, that our march was slow. Colonel West will proceed 3 or 4 miles farther, and bivouac for the night. I shall remain here till to-morrow morning; I wish to have the advance fresh when it makes a demonstration. If I can do so without serious loss, shall I or shall I not destroy the bridges [railroad and Bottom's Bridge.] We have found and driven some squads of enemy's pickets, and lost 1 officer, captured. Please give bearer quick dispatch to return.

I am, respectfully, yours,E. D. KEYES,
