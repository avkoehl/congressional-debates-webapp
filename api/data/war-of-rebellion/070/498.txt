CUMBERLAND, May 19, 1864-9 a. m.

Brigadier-General WEBER,

Harper's Ferry:

Push the work of laying the pontoon bridge as rapidly as possible; make a strong detail from the artillery on Maryland Heights to assist. Have the troops en route for Washington pushed over as soon as pontoon is completed. Please see Mr. Willard, the railroad agent, and direct him to have some of the trains moved down from Martinsburg with troops by the time the bridge is completed; also to have trains in readiness at Sandy Hook to carry them forward.

Please advise me if the pontoon has arrived.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY:

Your telegram is received. The orders will be promptly executed. The pontoons have not yet arrived. The rope has been prepared and the railroad company have their boat running across the river for passengers, and will allow no officers in the same without a railroad ticket, which causes much trouble. I have word that the chess are at Sandy Hook; the boats are very moment expected.

MAX WEBER,
