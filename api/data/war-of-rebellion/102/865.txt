General Dodge has shipped a large cavalry force from Leavenworth to Omaha to go up Loup Fork and thence north along east base of Black Hills to act in conjunction with a column under General Connor advancing from the west against the Indians in Black Hills. Both these columns will cover the country and beat the Indians in Sully's rear.

Bvt. Major General J. A. RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff:

I respectfully forward the following views for the consideration of the lieutenant-general I will have the following troops in Texas without the Fourth Army Corps, viz: General Merritt's column of cavalry, 4,000 strong, ordered from Shreveport to San Antonio; General Custer's column, 4,000 strong, ordered to Houston; two divisions of Grangers' corps, which after the 30th of September will number about 7,000 strong, two divisions being under Steele on the Rio Grande and the other will be at Galveston and Houston. The Twenty-fifth Army corps numbers about 16,000 and will be at Indianola, Corpus Christi, and Brownsville. The bulk of the corps will be at Brownsville and that vicinity. This will make a grand aggregate of 32,000 men. To support a larger number of men in Texas will be very expensive, and I think on due reflection
