Your dispatch in reference to report to Heth's and Wilcox's division received 1.30 p. m. I will at once make preliminary arrangements.

HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,March 30, 1865-7.15 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

Since the storm we have had a fine opportunity to observe the enemy's lines. I have just returned from our lines. Could discover no changes. The usual number of men were to be seen on the picket and main lines, and there seems to have been no change in the number of tents visible. General Potter reports that he is satisfied there is no change in the enemy's line on his front, and that his force has not been reduced. A deserter from the Sixth Alabama, Grimes' division, came into our lines about 1 p. m. He says he came from the main line, heard of no movement of troops excepting some artillerymen, who were relieved by men from a Virginia battalion. The artillerymen were sent to their right; the guns were left in position. His positive information, however, is confined to his own division.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
