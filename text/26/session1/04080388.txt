Here he w vs pleaded to sa) that tilt, gieatest part ol the Govern-
ment azents answered in the n gat ve, but there were others
vr hose answers were not so satisi ic on, and here, (said Mr B)
alluding to the answer of Mr G llissol the h ourth Auditor's oí-
rles is an instance where the draft ol the Government was
sold for these notes three months alter tthe Bank had
stopped payment, and paid out as the cuirency of the Govern-
ment The iniormation which he hal rcteived, also showed
that a person bv the name of R iberts w as now in the Southwest
with inMiie.ise paclva¿es ol the Bank of the Um ed States notes,
ani lie had also learned that this person had obtained a list of the
Treasurv dra is issued here to uisbursing agents in the South
west, and was pursuing the officers ol the Government ad over
the West to purchase these drafts out of their hands This
wis the amount of his information, and it was not to be dis-
puted There was pretty good proot of it here The Bank of
th" lTnited Spates had gone upon this system of making Ihe Go-
vt rmnent the circulator of her no eB—even the old dead ones—
and ol making them the currency of the Federal Govemment.and
iuuher, to put out both Hie notes of the old Ba ,k, which it is an
offence, under 'he act ol Congress, to circulate, as -.ell as ihe
no es ol ihe new Bank, both befjie and alter it had stopped pay-
ment Ttiere was one strong case presented in the statement he
had read, and that was that there was a hundied and titty thou-
sand do ars of these notes sent as far as Arkansas, there to
be loaned u a single company of contractors lo purchase cattle
in the W-st It was bad enough, in all conscieace, for a Dank
to lend her notes at her counter, when ohe was going to s*op pay-
ment, but to s nd them out to a distance, for ihe game purpo-e,
was carrying toe matter a little further than he had imagined
these mstitu'iors v.ouid venture to i*o
Wnile these thinss were going on at a distance, the same
thing was done a Utile nearer, say within 100 miles From
the luformatioa given him by a citizen, it appeared that a spe-
cie draft was sold for paper, and that the difference, which was
thirteen hundred dollars, the agent had passed to the credit of
the Government It the agent had rei eived this thirteen hun-
dred dollars, and creihted the United States with it, what was
it but houlins so much from the pubVc creditors'! The United
States has paid thirteen hundred dollars less than the public
creditors wieentitled to Theinfoimation added, that the Ad
mni-tration lo-t ground very much by collecting good money
and payni" out d predated paper, and in particular it was
used asan argument, that theGovernmentcould not get along
wuhout a Bank of the Untied Sta es. He, h mself, had had y
thrown up to him last summer, in the West, that the notes of
the Bank of 'he Urn ed Slates were the best cunency, that
they were received, every when-, by the officers of the Govern
inert, and paid out by them Mr B said he thought it was
due to the -ujj o 'o bring it before Congress lie thought it
due to the wuo'e question m m ike an authentic exposition of
the tact that the Bank of the United States was systematically
sending her agents tnrough the ceuntry, carry inglier notes along
with them, that is, first, tm" old dead notes, winch the
law mule it penal to cirgulate, and, secondly, the new
no es of the Bank, before and since it had stopped pay-
ment wii h they put of on the agents of the Government, in
as many case  as possible, for their specie drafts, and he larther
Wished feynose the fact, that this Bank was systematically
purituneih  nma to irs- at this very time One of the an-
swisthat hi f beer ~iven or the caí, made upon his reso-
lution, showed that in this city, almost hi the presence of the
Government, the Government drafts were sold for the notes of
this iar,k three month'' afier u had stuped It was no won-
der then that the cry was raised of one currency for the office
holders, and another for ihe people
Mr B said he should, for the present, only ask for the print-
ing of these papers What course it would be proper to take
with them, would be a matter ol consideration when all the an-
swers came in One course that whu h nata rally suggested itse If,
was tu refer then to thef resident of the United States, whose
dtuty it was to see that tie officers under him did their duty,
in oider that the pioper remedy might be applied Whether
the Senate would adopt any leg slative action or not, would be
for them to decide when the proper time arrived. At present he
only asked for the printing of the papers.
Mr. WEBSTER said, ifhe understood the drift of the charge,
It was ihat certain disbursing officers had received specie or
«,)ecie fluids o pay ihe creditors of ihe G jvernment, had ex-
changed these lunds (o* depreciated bank papex, and
paid out the u pieciated pej er to those who were
entitled to receive specie or Us equivalent. If tins was a
fyct, it wis a singular camment on the present state of the cur
rency, and if peí sundín the employment of the Government
had conducted themselves in th s manner, instead of denounc
ing the banks for endeavoring to get specie or Government
drafts for their depieciated paper, we should inquire into the
conduct of our disbursing agents, over whom we have some
control, and see if their conduct has been perfectly correct in
the premise .
Mr 8CV1ER observed tliat there was one case only pre-
sented in the papers just read to the Senate, which made it ne-
cessary for him to say any thing in relation to the subject under
consideration, and that was the case of the $90,000 draft, sold
last summer by Col Rector.   Now, he had received a letter
from ihis disbursing officer, when the call was made last sum
mer, an 1 the facts of the case were these   When this gentleman
was here last summer, die Bank of the United States was pay-
ing specie lor its notes, and every body believed that tlie paper
of that Balk was a a good asepecie. Under tnese circumstances,
he got the pemissi-vn of CoL Towson hinisel', predicated upon
the request of the officers who were to be paid by him, to ex
change ihe draft received from the. Government for Uniteu
State* Bank notes    It was true, as the Senator from Missouri
ami, that, after he got them notes th« Bank, stopped payment,
b«l he made the exchange while the Bank was a specie paying
faaak,andgotinepí'rmiss/Oíiofthe Payma.-ter General and the
«jereury of War for it.   Now with regard to Roberts    The
«««rawoWsrioJjuioiotHaiiied a tean/ioin Roberts himself, as
tfcey bad a right tt do, and he received Jus pay from them after
the appropriation passed It was true that Roberts was out
in the Southwe  exchanging bank notes for specie and Go-
vernment dralts, and, wiiett er the notes wue good or bad,
those w vi took them wti Hi be-' judgt, but the G v< rnment

Senate With respeu to the $90 000 draft, lie in tde a special
statement that, on the 7th day of October, 1839 the agen of the
Bank of the United Slates bought It from the disbuising olhotr
of the G ivernment, and that, on tht, Sth or 9 h d ly of tne same
month, the Bank stopped Yes, on the v rj instant of their
stopping, $90 000 of their notes had been pu oft on an officer of
the Government, ft ho was on hi-- way to the West, where they
were disbmsed as Government currency ©n the 18th day ol
Octobei, thnS90000 was roiled out of ihe bank at S Louis,
shipped to Philadelphia, from whence it went to London, while
its di-honoied notes were paid out by out officers That was
one ease out of many others, and he had no doubt but the an
swers that were yet to come in would present otheis equally as
stiong. This was a case in which depreciated paper was put
off on a Government othier, drawing from ui, in place of it,
our hard money, and thu authorizing the enemies of the Admi-
nistration to say that i h id failed to pay specie for it-, en ng
ments, and adopted the United States Bink no es How filled?
Because the Bonk wis enabled, by sen ling out its agutts, to get
the specie from the G ivernment oftkeis, and send it io London
That was the reason why the Government failed in the mvtarict s
he ha 1 cited, and he wasi ow able to pi ove it The Bank agents

was immediately shipped to London litase facts would be
brougl out and pioved ui such a way that it would Le ¡mpos
sib e to deny them
Th' re was no peison, he repeated, more careful than he was
of bi mging the mmes of individuals before the Senate H*
purposely avoided mentioning Mr Reuor's name at all
Doubtless this gentlemm's answer would come in with the
others, and the part that he had acted would be fully explained
He knew he was no to blame, he knew (Mr B sud) that it
would disclose ihe fact he had °tated Bui what had this to do
with the point he wished to bring to the notice of the Senate—
the conduct of the B inki He had stated that the day before the
Bank stopped, one of its agents got out of the hands of anoffuer
of the Government a Treasury draft for $90,000, and paid him
in notes of a bank which was to sop the next day Our odkers
(said Mr B ) are trailed by the agents of this Bank, who, in one
respect are supern r to the Cuba bloodhounds, which had betn
f mnd useless ¡n Florida, because they would not take the trail at
all They not only (sa d Mr B ) take the trail with wonderful
sagacity, but they hold on after they have caught the game—
they never let go their hold till they have got the Treasury
draft, it it can hi. hal You will have (said Mr B ) proof upon
proof of what I have sa d You will have it fiom the South
west, the great field where the Bank of the United States carried
oi its Oferations, and  here l' undertook to make the people
believe that she furnished the bestcur ency for the Government,
that she upheld the Federal Government, and that the Federal
Government could noteet along without her.
It was upon this state of things that the charges he had refer-
red to were made against the Government—and it was upon
the information thus obtained that he had made the call
which brought in the answers that had just b> en read to the Se
nate But the gieat point he made was, not to criminate indi-
viduáis, but to lay bare the con 'uctofthis Bank before the pub
lie eye I' was to show that this Bank, ever since it obtained
its new charter, had been assiJuously engaged, first, in endea-
voring to show that «he upholds the credit of the Government,
s condly in endeavoring to pass off her old dead notes, and
in the third place, to pass off he notes ol ihe new Bank al er it
had slopped payment. And further, that this Bank, differing
from other banks'hat loaned out money attheir counters, sent
their notes a long way off by their agents, to l«an to contrac-
tors and others, and after all this the Government was to be
taunted with the charge that it had failed to pay specie fonts
engagements—thatits hard money was ahumb ig, and that it
could not do without a Bank of the United States, whose cur-
rency it adopted All this was done by a bank whose stock,
though not woiih five cents m the dollar to keep, furnished a
currency for the American peoole, and that too m exchange
for gold and silver, obtained from Government agents, and
Which, although she would pay lierErglish stockholders well,
would prohdbK never pay her American stockholders a dollar
Mr HENDERSON saidthat it appeared by some of the re
plies, that notes of other non specie paying binks, in addition
to the Un ted Stiles Bank, had been received by the officers of
Government, and argueu to show that even the notes of specie
paying banks at a distance, or disadvantageous^ situated, were
not equivalent to specie or specie funds at the place of pay-
ment,                                                                                                 i
Mr SEVIER had onlv a word to say    He wag sorry that his
remarks were misunderstood    He had said that in the first
case referred to, the individual had so'd a Government draft for
what he consideied equal to specie, and this was done with the  I
assent of those who had authority to give it    If the Bank after-  '
wards broke faith with her creditors and stopped payment, that
could not be chaigetl as a crime upon lnm    With reaard to the
gieatamount of notes of the Unued States Bank now in circu-
lation on our Southwestern border, th" Government was not in
fault    The asent of the Bank, Mr Roberts, takes out immense
amounts in notes of the Bank, he loans them to those who have
contr iCted tosuoply the Government tiooos with prwv ^ions, or
perform any oi her service, these contractors pay them out to
the farmers or drovere for their com or their cattle, and thus
they get intooircuUtion    V  I en thecontrai torreceiveshis iwy
from the Government, in Treasury no es or a specie draft, he   I
hands it ovei to the agent of the Bank, in repayment of his  i
loan, and the -pecie is drawn on account of the Bank, and she
«ends it where she pleases.   Can the Government prevent this
result, or is she to bWe for its occurrence!   He knew that  I
there were several agents of the Bank on the borders of Mis-
souri and Ai kansas, indeer1 thej >* might be one in every Indian
tnoe, (or aught he knew, who Muk every occasujn to exchange ]
ibeur notes for Treasury drafts, but th,is was not a matter for
which the Government was responsible He cortended that
the Government had done its duty, and in every instance had
paid out the currency of the C< ristitution

of the no is of th-" L uted fci ites Bank in v irulannn hi the

nothing of the farts alluded to bj the gentlemen who preceded
him, but he would ^ay that it t e a?, nt of the Bink of the
United States, oi any other bank, had exchanged their notes for
Government drafts, with ani=pensioi ol payments ni contera
plation it was a mostdisgracelul IriJd
Mr BE1NTON leplitd,that thednft was dated on the se-
venth of October, and the Bank stopped on 'he eighth or the
ninth The draft was sold in this | lace, one Govt rnment offi
cer having been wavlai 1 forthe purpose of putting the e notes
on him Hetnokthem as the notes of a specie payin' lank,
and the next day the B^nkstopped payment On the eighteenth
of the same mon h, the speci for this draft was rolled out fiom
the Baik of Missouri,in St I ouis, and shipped to Philadelphia,
from whence i' was carried to London, and the notes of the
United States Bank paid t iour ereditoip With lespecttothe
agreement of which the Senator from Kentutkv spoke, the in-
formation which he had read lust now, showe I tint there had
be_ii three violations Of t The fiist was the Bink paying out
the aid dead notes of the old Bank, which wasinoff nee against
oui laws '1 he second violation was their havif % pud notes
undt r twenty ollars, and the third violation was their havjj g
paid out past notes or ' Ross notes," as ihey were called in the
Southwest But the Senato, from Arkansas, it seemed, could
not take the pointwhich he had made
He had not arraigned any officer here When all ihe infir-
ma ion camein, he should move to lay it before the Presidtnt
of the United «totes, in order that he might examine it and see
ii a y remedy ciuld be applied His object further was that
it shrUM be examined in the Senate that they might judge
whetnei any legislative act on was net essaiy Wi h respect
to tl e offkers a d contraetors, he h id no' a word to say, at the
present umo fie would not rut them o the trouble ol making
any explanations He would not name them here He was
awaie that Mr Rector, before he had m-it'e his arrangement,
had obtained th< pel mission of his immeliate chief He did
not mention Mr Rector's name, nnr di I he mean to do it His
gieat objett was to show t lat we ha' e been pay mg out the pa-
pei ol br iken banks, receive! m exe'iJrse lor sjiecie, and
that the charge was, in consequence, made, in the South-
west that the Government could not do w thout them,
and that it was notorious that the notes of this broken
Bank had frmished a currency for this General Cjvernmtnt
They say the attempt to pay specie had failed Now he
wished to know if it took any more trouble to pay out the hard
monev to our creditors than to ship l' off to London His de-
clare un was that the agtnts of this Bank trailed and waylaid
t eGivi rnm nt officers, even across the Mississippi, and get-
ting the r specie drafts from them shipped it off to the banU,
and thence to Loidin W i n V was in theSiu hwest last fall,
it was in vain foi him to say thatt^e G iveniment was innocent
of all this, for the poople seeing the immense circu ation of
these notes, aid that they w*ie pail out L/ our agents, con-
tractor, and officers, naturally supposed they came from the
Government Th t determined him to g t this information:
and when the facts all came in, the charge lie had made would
he fixed on the Bink so firmly that it would be impossible for
them to deny it It would be s^en tha. she had mad  the United
States the circulater of her notes, and even those which it was
illegal to circulate
Mr WEBSTER said that the sta ement admitted the extraor-
dinary imbecility of the Government It admitted that the at-
tempt to establish a specie circulation had failed, and failed
through th^ energy and address of a State institution It ac-
knowledged that the Government only played second fiddle to
this corporation m the commercial and fiscal affairs of the coun-
try He contended that it was utterly impossible, in the nature
of things, for the Government to maintain specie pavments,
while the gieat mass of the circulation was composed of depre-
ciated bank paper, and went into details to show how an attempt
to do so must inevitably fail He said that while the Senator
from Missouri had been loud in his denunciations of a State
corporation, ovei which we had no control, for doing that Which
we had no power to prevent, he had entirely overlooked the offi-
cers of the Government who had participated in the offence,
and who were within the reach of legislative or Executive
action
Mr BENTON observed that the Senator from Massachu-
setts [Mr Webstek] said that he (Mr B ) overlooked the petty
delinquencies ol theeffieers of the Government while he pour-
ed out the vials of his wrath on the head of the Bank of the
United States Now he staled to the Senate, aid he belived se-
veral tunes over, that these papers would go to the President of
the United Siatts, whose duty it wss to see that his officers did
their duty, and that he would e amine them, and seeing the
conduct of each officer in each part'cular case, would apply the
proper remedy if found necessary That was one course he
proposed to take Another was, w hen all the answers came lry
to make them the subject of some legislative action en the pirt
of the Senate, but he disclaimed now, when the information
was only received in part, any intention of dragging the Go-
vernment officers before the Senate, or ofsaymgone word about
them, or naming one of them He had, however, distinctly
stated that either upon his motion or that of some other Sena-
tor, all this information would be referred to the President for
his action, and that it would become his duty as one bound to
see the laws of the country faithfully executed, to apply the
proper remedy
Now, so .ar from this information proving that the attempt
to pay the engagements ol ths Government in hard money
had failed.he undertook to say that the contrary wasproved by it,
and that from this umo forth, the practice would be estab ished.
By the lime that ail the officers had answered all ihoquesuons
propounded to them, it would he in the power of the Govern-
ment to have in its seivice none but such as w*>uld fulfil the
laws of the country, and those who would obey the instructions
of the Government We have yet to be madeacquainted with
'Something new under the sun, when we learn that it would
take moi e money to pay the creditors ofthe Government in hard
money, than it w uld take to pay the hard money over to the
Bank ofthe United States.-< He admitted that other Government
officers paid over the money m the first instance; thee  W«9
