[CHAP. XLII.

LA GRANGE, October 13, 1863.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Cars all went to Memphis yesterday. I ordered your men at Moscow to come here this morning. I believe Sweeny has some of Spooner's men with him. The rest shall start to-morrow morning; will relieve brigade at Pocahontas. Have heard nothing from Corse or Hatch since you left here.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General.

LA GRANGE, October 13, 1863.

Colonel MERSY:

Relieve the brigade of Sherman's command, and allow them to move on to Corinth. We must do the best we can with our own forces.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tenn., October 13, 1863.

Brigadier-General CARR,

La Grange, Tenn.:

General Sherman must have a battery. He can take Welker's or Richardson's as you and he agree. If he will be satisfied with Richardson's I should prefer it. Arrange that with him. Forage is being pushed out as fast as practicable. The whole rolling-stock is taken up with forage and rations for Corinth. Sweeny ought to be up with Chalmers and Richardson last night near Byhalia, at Ingraham's Mill.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

LA GRANGE, October 13, 1863.

General SHERMAN:

Welker's battery is with Sweeny. General Hurlbut notified me that he was to give a good battery. I supposed he meant company and all, and had intended Richardson's for you, which is a good one, rather short of men, but they are all in the same fix.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tenn., October 13, 1863.

Brigadier General E. A. CARR,

La Grange, Tenn.:

Send work to Hatch and Sweeny to press Chalmers to the sharpest extent; to destroy all bridges, mills, and corn-fields, from the Tallahatchie to Coldwater; to take all the horses and mules south of the Tennessee line and drive in all stock that can be available. Let the command reassemble from pursuit near Quinn and Jackson's Mill and report from there.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
