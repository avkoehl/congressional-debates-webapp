CHAMBERSBURG, July 10, 1863-9 p. m.

Brigadier-General SMITH:

Note received, &amp;c. I cannot give you an order to join Meade, not knowing about your position in reference to the Army of the Potomac. With my present force, if you go forward, I must remain here for a time. If it is in accordance with Meade's wishes, go by all means. Captain Potter will see you to-night and explain matters.

There is no difficulty in getting provisions now. I have set that all right. Provisions have been sent to Gettysburg for you. Let me know if you leave.

Respectfully, yours,

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

[P. S.]-I ordered 1, 000 pairs of shoes from Shippensburg for you, to be brought here to-day.
