Saint Louis, Mo., March 19, 1863.

Colonel W. HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners:

COLONEL: I send forward to-day by express the list of prisoners other than prisoners of war called for by your telegraphic order of the 4th instant. The number of those who are strictly citizens is comparatively small. The larger share of the list is composed of those whom I have styled bushwhackers. The members of this latter class cannot claim to be prisoners of war, neither can they claim as citizens a trial by the slow and expensive methods of civil law. I would recommend that the most desperate among them be tried by military commissions on the charge of violation of laws and customs of war and that the rest be exchanged.

I have the honor to be, colonel, your obedient servant,

F. A. DICK,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Provost-Marshal-General.
