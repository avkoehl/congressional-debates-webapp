FALMOUTH, KY., October 20, 1862.

Major-General WRIGHT, Cincinnati, Ohio:

Our scouts from Paris have just captured a prisoner who had in his possession a letter from General Marshall to his wife that states that the entire rebel army is on its way out of the State of Kentucky as fast as it can go. "Our army has divided. General Bragg has gone one route, General Kirby Smith another, and Marshall another. Our route is the same as the one by which we entered the State. We will return by that terrible mountain road into good old VirginiaJanuary

I have telegraphed for the letter and will send it you. O, a kingdom for four regiments of cavalry!
