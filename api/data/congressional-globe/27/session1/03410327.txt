CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
m
forced to debate the question here whether Con-
gress will make this disposition rf them, or will
give them away It is admitfed on all hands, if
these proceeds be taken from the commr n Trea
sury, an equal amount of money must be raised
by loa'is or taxes ana relumed to that Treasury to
supply the deficiency m it wmch will tb.u-.be crea-
ted, and yet the question is giavely entertained and
discussed, whether it he the duty of Congress to
give away the proceeds of the lands and lay the
taxes, or to retain the money md prosecute vigo-
rously and efficiently our systems of national de-
fence. Upon such questions I cannot entertain
doubts
Were ihisexpensive system of defences not now
pres ed upon us from the proper official quarters,
there would be greater seeming propnetj m the
course which ihe friends of this distribution bill
propo°e to pursue; and really, while I do not mean
to make a lemark which ran have a personal
bearing in any dnection, c?n gentlemen hope hat
the country uill entertain perfect confidence in tne
s ncen'y « tth uhich tbey press their prop' sed sys-
tems of defence and their imn di„ie and urgent
necessity, if ihey reject a" amendment of tins, cha
racter, and b) 'he passage of the bill g vc away the
only means which the Treasmy can spare to carry
out their defensive policy? Will they no', by such
action, lay the foundation for a possible suspicion
that the pub'ic defences are, with them, matter ot
ta'k, whih the distnbation of "he public money
which should be expended upon them, is the ical
object to be reached?
I propose, Mr President, briefly to examine Ihe
interests of mv own S ate in reference to the adop
tion or rejection of this amendment, though u*-as
not been my habit to discuss veiy extensively here
her interests, touching any subject of national le-
gislation, assepir i'ed f'om the general interests of
the whole Union Njr do I think I-ha)1 subject
myself t s«ch a ch?rge in this instance, as the
more immediate local interests of the etate 01 New

ot national defeno, doe- not 'eparate that work

nation, of which it is an integral part, nor does the
work constructed 11 nrou-ct our commerce, 01 de-

Look, then, at the Atlantic frontier of New
York There we hive the most important town
upon th-continent the comme'ciil emporium of
the Union, as we are daily told, wholly and entire-
ly detence'e^s Tee protection of its commerce is
not a matter of meie local concernment It is the
protection of a very large sn?re of Ihe commerce
of the whole Un n Its perfect defence, therefore,
i< the defence of the property and interests of the
Union, as wtll as jf New York, and the necessity
for a speedy completion of all the means for de-
fending tbnt impon int point, is in ptopor'ion lo the
magnitude and extuit of t^e interests placed in jeo
pardy  while it íenums «o peifectly exposed

York. Here  e have a navigable lake of some
hundred and fifi y miles in extent, s ¡me t,veniy or
thirty mdfs of whi h s within the British territory,
while ihe remainder is within our own, and die

of tne imperta! ce ¿ id die exposure of this portion
of the fronttei, su reptible of perfect defence, at a
comparatively mod i late expense, bv woiks which
will command the lake, at or near the boundary
of the British terruory.     Such  works the British
already nave upm iheir portion of  the lake, ana
such works we should have
Pass from this lake west, along the forty fif h
degree of latitude, to the uyer Si Lawrence, near
Ine Indian town of St. Regis, and New York has
a land frontier, of some seventy miles in extent,
wholly undefended This pi rtion of ihe front er
may, perhaps, be less suscepiible of protection
from works of defence, than the water portions,
but Us conditio! should be examined, and what
ever can wisely be rone, should certainly be done,
in preference to givinz away the money of the
country without an examination into its exposed
condition
From St Regis to Lake Ontario the river St
Lawrence is the boundary between us and the
British pos essions, a distance of some hundred and
twenty to a hundred and forty miles Por almost
the entire distance ihe river is navigable anl nivi
gated t>y steam ve seis, and for ihe who.e of the
uppir halt by any snen, and any other vessels,
which navigate the lake itself Tht settlements
upon each bank of the river are nearly continu
oas thtoughout this whole line, whue ihe villages
and ir-idmg town-  upon ea'h side are quite nume-
urus in some cases considerably large, m many
instaures within cannnn shot of each other, and
in almost i'l cases within cannon shot from the
oppo ite bore. Such is a sketch of the position
of that p i on of the New York frontiet The
British hav  everal military posts and defended
pcsitions aiJ'ig this rinr, an I we have nothing.
Next conus ar liontier upon Lake Ontario,
embracing a" extent ot lake coast of, 1 suppo e,
not less than tw > hur dred and fifty, and perhaps
nearer three hundred miles. A reference to the
naval force which we were compelled to place
upon this lake, during the K'e "'ar, will furnish
ample evidence f the importance of the pos tion
I believe our na ry there, before the close of thit

a class ot v ,tls Mipenor n tonnage and

stale of forwai i e^s, intended to mount more than
one hundr d guns each Indeed, my present ím-
pnsiionot 'he tacts is, that when that war er-
minated, oi<! navl force upon ihis single lake was
rapidly reaehmc an erjtm'ity in weight of metal to
our naval force upon the ocean The handol time
has long since annihilated that lake fleet, and we
have not now a floating force of a single gun upon
Lake Ontario Our public works upon (he land
are military barracks at Sackett's Harbor, not con-
structed tor defences, but for quarters for troops,
and som  receñí and very limited expenditures, by
way of repair^, to the old military works at Os-
wego anl Furt Niagara Still some of the largest
inland towns in he State are upon, and wi hm
reach from, this lake, and the whole country upm
the American sidj is densely settled, and one of the
most wealthy portions of the Um< n If wo. had
floating defences upon this lake, we havenofott-
ress, under the protection of which vessels of war,
or aimed sleamers, could rt-st safe from the attar ks
of a hostile force of ih^ same character.
At the foot of Lake Onurio, the British havr a
national work of the first clavs, intended '< cim-
mami tne entrai te to the 1-ki from the St Law-
p- nee, and abun taiulj sufficient to protect any
fleet of any d scnp'ion naval or eo men in,

sterling. Viewir* the vast ncrjase of population
and w<ahh ard trace on this frontier, since the

ptrations 'ora ate of h istihty, I hope it may

tonsiderations, and be induced from them to adopt
this amendment
From Lake Ontario, our boundary passes
through the narrow river, or strait, of Niagara,
to Lake Erie, a distance of between twenty and
thi'ty miles Here again are considerable towns
upon esch si e within ihe reach of cannon fren 
the opposite hore. Fort Niagara, near the en-
trance to the Niagara river from Lake Oatano,  
probably a •■ unable position for a defensive work
at that point, :>ut it is yet in a very inefficient state.
A frontier upon Lake Erie of some seventy miles,
from the head of the river or strait of Niagara to
the Pennsylvania line, is also in New York, and
here again is presented a trading town, which in
point of popí tation, wealth and commercial im-
portance, strnds m the first class. Buffalo
is a town tjw with a population of twenty
thousand s ids, and withm the last few day*
an honorable Senator from Michigan [Mr. Wood*
bridse] save to the Senate the number of arrivals
and departure of steamboats, and other commer
cial vessel , at and frem that port, for a single
per od of two weeis, withm the present season,
«■howina; an rc'ivity and amount of commerce al-
•nost merediMe for an interior town. Indeed this
point is the 1 e/ to the whole trade of Lake Erie,
and the win e vast chain of lakes above it, and
must ever be a commercial town second in ím
poitance to very few in the Union, not located
upon the Atlantic and gulf coasts. Sull it is en-
tirely undtfen led, as is the vast lake upon which
it is situate, and with all other large and flourish-
ing towns upon that lake, in New York, Pennsyl-
vania, Onio .ind Michigan, must be perfectly open,
in case of hostilities, to any incursion of an enemy
approaching from the water.
Is it possib e, then, that either New York, or the
Union, can he insensible to our perfect exjsosute
in this impo tant quarter? Or that, while the
name of the gallant and immortal Perry shall live
in the memories of his countrymen. Lake Erie
will be thrown open to the unresisted possession
ot the B'Hish power? And will that be done by
ihe Comiie>s of the United States, that it may give
away the money which should defend this conse-
crated lake? Oan I, Mr President, as one of the
represen atives of the S ate of New York upon
this floor, consent to such a policy? Can I, when
the exposure ot that noble State ii suchas I describ-
ed it, and when its highest interests are thas m-
tima'ely con >ected with the great and necessary
works of na'ional defence, military and naval,
hesitate to choose betweeii these propositions'}
Will her pr ibable dividends under this distribu-
tion law compensate her for the risks she must run,
and the losses she must sustain for the want of
these defences' It seems to me not, and hence I
hope the amendment may pass.
I do not pn pose to advert to the general sub-
jects of mitat on, now open and unsettled, be-
tween this country and Great Britain, and which
may lead to nauonal hostility They have been
fully anl eloq lently exhibited to ns by the hono-
rable Senator from Missouri [Mr Linn] on my
iigns but tier is one of those subjects so pecu-
liarly -onneit ig itself with the State of New York
at this momeit, that I cannot fail to notice it. I
refer to fie ■ ase of McLeod, n w waiting his
trial before the courts ot that S at upon the charge

or proper in r - to take part in that debate. The
