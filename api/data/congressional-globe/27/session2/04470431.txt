Lawrence was a native and Representative, and
the relatives and freidsof the deceased. The
President and hi& Cabinet followrd, and took the
seits assigned to then>, near toe corp^ej and they
were succeed d by the Sent'e and tne officers of
that body. General Scott, ihs commanding gen-
eral of the armvj and other nathK.y ( fficers at the
seat of government, had en'ered t e House atan
earlier period. The attendance of members and
^t angers was less numerous than en other similar

the sioroi which wai lagin*?, anJ or the ra n which

Death, on a'l occasions an awful occurrence, and
at all timeb naturally leading the mind to reflections
solemnand imp'-e sjve, wab sometimes made lessap-
pallirg by the consciousness that a good man had
died In this case, the pious divme who performed the
funeral service, said they were not called to mourn
a? tat se that have no hope, and hence he had
adopted the text ubich he had read as the founda-
