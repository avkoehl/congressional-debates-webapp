taking place from our agricultural to our man-
ufacturing pursuits, under the fostering care of
our present protective system and the steady-
increase by emigration, will soon consume the
small amount now exported. To show the
astonishing advance made in this direction by
emigration the past few years, during which
occurred a long war, of frightful carnage and
expenditure, I refer you to the following table
of statistics furnished in the report of Mr.
Wells, showing the annual emigration from
185C to 1809:

Tho present increment of population of the United
States, from tiio natural increase ot births over
deaths and from immigration is, probably, at the
rate of 1,100,000 per annum as a minimum.
It will be seen, by referring to the above
(able, that the greatest number of emigrants
reached our shores in the year 18(59 ; the least
number in 1861; between these two extremes
the next greatest number arrived in 1806 ; and
the next least number in 1859. These figures
prove conclusively that so far as the advan-
tages of emigration are concerned, that there
has been a constant and steady improvement
from the year 1801 to the year 180!). The
small number exhibited in the report for 1801
is easily accounted for. It was the second year
of the war, when our prospects were dnrkest.,
when it appeared to the Europeans that (lie
glories of our Republic were about to bo eclipsed
forever, when labor was about to 1)0 rcduced
to a permanent competition with slavery, when
even the oppression of European Governments
were preferable to the degradation to which
honest labor was threatened with in the United
States.
But from that dark hour emigration and uni-
versal prosperity steadily advanced. Terrible
and devastating as was the conflict which fol-
lowed these lowest figures, emigration, with
every other substantial advancement, steadily
progressed, until our country in every depart-
ment, the agricultural, the mechanical, the
manufacturing, the mining interests have at-
tained a degree of prosperity never equaled in
our history, and all this is under the protective
policy contemplated in this bill, and which its
opponents say is at war with all the interests
of our country. To fully substantiate these
statements 1 do not appeal to any deductions
which may be drawn by the friends of this bill,
but will again fake the liberty to quote from
the anti-protective document of Mr. Commis-
sioner Wells:
"Toreview the main features of our national expe-
rience in respect to capital and industry tor the past
year is but to ehromelc and affirm anew the appar-
ent continuance of that same wonderful rate of pro-
41st Cong. 2d Sess.—.No. 140.
gress and development -which, with the exception
of a period of war, lias especially characterized the
history of thenation for the last quarter of a century.
" The revenue receipts of the national exchequer,
as in every other year since the termination ot the
war, have been largely in excess of national expend-
itures ; the tide of labor-seeking, wealth-producing
immigration continuesto flow with increasing volume
upon our shores of the West as upon those of tho
Bast; the aggregate of tho crops has been bountiful
in quantity, excellent in quality, and in excess of
any recent average; thockclo of settlementhasbeen
so rapidly extended that millions of acres aro now
included in its area which twelve months ago were
uncultivated wilderness; the number of miles of
railway constructed has been greater than that of
any preceding year, and a regular daily routine of
travel and traffic has for tho first time been estab-
lished thereon across tho continent; the restoration
of the South to a condition of prosperity, equal or
greator than that which prevailed antecedent to tho
war. is a work well-nigh accomplished: peace reigns
in all our borders; and from tho Atlantic to tho
Pacific, from the St. John's to tho Kio Grande, there
aro few who, exempt from physical ailment, need
hunger from scarcity of food, or bo idle lor lack of
some opportunity for remunerative employment. In
short, the experience of another year reaffirms the
principle before announced that tho progress and
growth of tho country, throughits elements of vital-
ity, namely, great national resources and an inherent
spirit of energy and enterprise in the pooplc, are in
a great degree independent ot legislation, and of the
impoverishment and disorder which the oocurronco
of a long war has necessarily occasioned."
From this wonderful exhibition of progress,
nevor equaled by any official statement in the
history of the world, we leuru that under the
working of the present, protective system of
trade we are not only developing our own un-
bounded resources, thereby giving employment
to thousands of our skilled mechanics, laborers,
and miners, but making a ready and remuner-
ative market for the products of the fanner.
Under this same system of protection which
has been so misrepresented by its enemies, we
are not only, as stated abovo, creating profitable
employment for a large number ol our popu-
lation not engaged in farm labor, furnishing
a remunerative market tor our ngriculturist,
but are actually rapidly reducing the public
debt, as will be seen from the following state-
ment from Commissioner Wells's report:

Reduction of the national debt.

to that dato of $203,087,090 85. Within the same
period, tnxes—which if continued to the present
t ime would have yielded in tho aggregate upward of
#200,000.000 per annum, have also been abated or
relinquished. To find a parallel to such re.mlts tho
financial history of other natioiu will bo searched to
no purpose.

tho 1st of ^September, 1805, of $301,129,830 20. and for
the current calendar year, of #$7,117,4&5 02."
It will also he seen by the above statement
that we have a surplus of revenue which might
be reduced without detriment to the Govern-
ment. There are certain articles of trade, such
as coffee, tea, and some other imports which
are consumed by the masses of the people, and
which we are unable to produce in sufficient
quanties at home, that I am in favor of admit-
ting free of duty. The friends of free trade,
in their zeal to defeat this bill, seem to lose
sight of the fact that by the repeal of the pres-
ent tariff they would force the population now
engaged in manufacturing, mechanical, and
mining pursuits into competition with the pres-
ent agricultural interests, whose special friends
they profess to be, and by that means destroy
farming as an occupation of profit.
Of all the interests of our country demand-
ing our attention we may rank the agriculturist
as the leading, as one out of every two and a
half persons (exclusive of the recent slave pop-
ulation) now inhabiting our country, according
to the census of I860, are engaged in farm-
ing. This must be conclusive proof to any
unbiased mind that to adopt such a policy us
would compel our large annual increase of
population to become cultivators of the soil,
and thereby force them into competition with
the present agricultural interests of the coun-
try, must necessarily entail ruin and bank-
ruptcy to all. I do not desire to be understood
as saying that the opponents of this bill wish
for any such sad consequences, or that they
are not sincere in their convictions, but fully
believe they all have the good of the country
at heart. While according to the enemies of
this bill honesty of purpose, I still insist that
if their theory should prevail, though I am
confident it will not, it would do more to crip-
ple the prosperity of the Government than
any policy that could be adopted, believing as
I do that the true theory of this Government is
to adopt such legislation as will enable the
capitalists and laborers to apply themselves to
the development of our vast mineral resources
and the building up and working of furnaces,
mills, &c., in our own midst, which will neces-
sarily bring the producer and consumer into
close connection with each other with profit
to nil.
To accomplish these desirable ends we must
adopt such a policy a will tend to diminish
our surplus of food and lessen our dependence
on the foreign manufacturer, In this way we
would compel the foreign artisan who would
supply us with his goods to come aud settle
among us, who furnish the raw material, and
thus save the enormous amount of capital
which would be shipped from our own midst
to purchase articles of foreign manufacture.
Such a policy we now have, and propose to
continue by the bill under consideration, and
which has proved so advantageous during the
last lew years, showing conclusively that such
a policy fully and faithfully carried out must
result, iu American independence.
It seems to me the only question involved
in this discussion is whether Congress is will-
ing lo sustain the manufacturing and mining
i u t crests of the coun try iu their efforts to de velop
our mineral resources, or by rashly defeat-
ing tins measure, or so amending it as to ren-
der it inoperative, to destroy the confidence of
capitalists who are so liberally investing their
means iu tho development of our resources, i:i
tho erection of furnaces and rolling-mills, and
in this way giving employment to thousandsof
laborers, making a ready market at the very
doors of our farmers for all their products.
The State of West Virginia, Mr. Speaker,
which I have the honor in part to represent, is
one of the richcst iu mineral resources of any
ol the States of the Union, especially in the
articles of coal, iron, and salt. In my own
congressional district alone, especially in the
great Kanawha valley, the supply of these last-
named products are inexhaustible, and with
proper protection these regions alone will fur-
nish profitable employment to thousands of
our workingmen and millions of capital. Vast
tracts of mineral lands unsurpassed in rich-
ness by any on the continent are there awaiting
development.
If this bill passes substantially as it comes
from the Committee of Ways and Means I
expect the country to prosper as never before
in our history. If Congress continues to give
us the assurance of its support I think I would
be safe msayingthat my own young State would
uouole m population and wsalth in the nest
ten years. Already, with the abolition of
slavery and the protection afforded by tlio,.
u-overnment, factories, furnaces, rolling-mills,
&c., are springing up, as if by magic, all over
the State.
In the article of salt alone, in the great If a-
