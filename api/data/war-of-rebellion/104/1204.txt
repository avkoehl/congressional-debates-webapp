HDQRS. EASTERN DIVISION, DISTRICT OF THE GULF,Blakely, April 5, 1865.

Colonel GARNER,

Chief of Staff:

You have received the reports direct from Spanish Fort. At this place the enemy have erected a battery on my left; have fired occasionally from it. Quite heavy skirmishing in my front. Report of casualties from Spanish Fort and this place was forwarded you last night.

ST. JNO. R. LIDDELL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Spanish Fort, April 5, 1865.

General MAURY:

The 30-pounder Parrott has not yet arrived. Can't these delays be prevented by increasing transportation? I must have some light, strongly-armed, fighting boat to protect our boat bringing supplies. I have given up all hope of our naval boat ever finding out where the enemy's right flank is and attacking it.

Brigadier-General.

HEADQUARTERS,Spanish Fort, April 5, 1865.

General MAURY:

It is over 400 yards from the works on the right through the fallen forest to the bay. It is over 100 yards from the works on the left to the water. The enemy has constructed a battery upon the left of Parrott guns commanding this space and is developing an infantry force there. He is doing the same thing on the right. I dont's believe I can do this work with the troops here. It extended the line over 500 yards. It must be defended, and I have began the work already. I will require at least 200 more negroes and 300 axes. Negroes are useless without axes. I will want half a dozen grindstones. I believe from water to water this line is nearly if not quite 3,000 yards. With the small force to cover it, a fife greater part of which has been on an unbroken strain for two weeks, I must be supplied with more heavy guns, more mortars, more axes, more negroes, to make a successful and triumphant defence, and besides these some little craft, under my orders, to watch the water flanks-some fighting craft. The present means of transportation from Mobile are wholly inadequate. Nothing new this morning. Enemy is firing his heavy batteries occasionally.

Brigadier-General.

General MAURY:

Can't you take a look at my lines to-morrow? I sincerely hope you will do so. I have not a single man to use on launches. I can't spare one from the main lines. My men are wider apart then they ever were and the enemy in large force, more active, and closer. Can you
