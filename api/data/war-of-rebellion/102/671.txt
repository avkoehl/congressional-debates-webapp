as practicable you send a command to the Pawnee Village with instructions to demand of the chiefs of the Pawnees the persons of the members of the tribe guilty of the murder of our soldiers, and in case of refusal to arrest five of the chiefs or principal men, bring them to Fort Kearny, where you will hold them securely, and report your action to these headquarters. As this is an important and delicate duty the general would prefer, if you have not a firm an discreet officer to command in person while making the arrest. If upon arriving at the Indian village and upon further investigation you have any doubts of the guilt of the Pawnees, of course you will not make the arrest, but will further investigate the matter.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
