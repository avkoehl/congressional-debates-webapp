The judge-advocate stated that notifications to the several officers into whose conduct, in connection with the evacuation of Maryland Heights and the surrender of Harper's Ferry, the Commission was instructed to inquire, were being issued, in order that they might have an opportunity of appearing before the Commission, cross-examining witnesses, and introducing such testimony as they might deem proper; and that, to afford time for the service of these notices, and for the parties to avail themselves of them, it would be necessary for the Commission to adjourn.

Whereupon the Commission adjourned to meet again to-morrow, Thursday, October 2, at 11 a. m.
