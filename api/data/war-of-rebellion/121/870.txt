SIR: I have the honor to reply to your communication of the 10th instant. General J. B. Clark was a conspicious rebel until about the time of the surrender of E. K. Smith, and to avoid consequences escaped into Mexico with the intention of eitehr settling in that country as an enemy to the United States or else going to California. Failing in his intentions he returned from Mexico to San Antonio, Tex., where, under directions from me to arrest civil and military representatives of the revellion so going to and returning from Mexico, he was arrested by Major-General Merritt and sent to me at New Orleans.

He came in company with Dr. W. M. Gwin, and when his case was reporte by me I received instructions to confine him at Fort Jackson (see inclosed copy of telegram).*

Doctor Gwin also came from Mexico to San Antonio and was arrested under the same order and sent to me at New Orleans. He was confined by order of the President, as per inclosed copy of telegram.*

At my reqest, made from fear that the mind of J. B. Clark was becoming affected by his misfortunes, hewas released, as per inclosed copy of dispatch from the War Department.+

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. H. SHERIDAN,
