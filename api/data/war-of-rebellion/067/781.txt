some distance of the track near Hanover Court-House. On the same day Generals Gregg and Wilson drove the enemy's cavalry across the Chickahominy, about 5 miles from Richmond; they would not, however, stand and fight. I then drew my command back to the White House, where supplies were sent me from Fort Monroe. My great difficulty has been about forage and subsistence. I supposed there would be plenty between the Pamunkey and Mattapony Rivers, but found myself mistaken. General Custer reported Breckinridge's command on the railroad when he cut it. I have further evidence of his arrival from the valley; also, that troops have been passing through Richmond for the last three days to re-enforce Lee. It is probable that some of them are from Drewry's Bluff. I shall march to Chesterfield in the morning, unless I received orders to the contrary. I have one day's rations for my men; no forage for my horses.

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,Camp on Pole Cat Creek, May 25, 1864.

GENERAL: I have the honor to notify you that I found my train at this place; the trains of the army were a short distance in rear. I therefore went into camp here. One division of my command is camped on the right flank, one on the left flank of the trains, and the other in front. About seven-eighths of the horses of the corps are in good working condition; six-eighths of the above number are in as good if not better condition than when I started on my expedition. This is a minimum estimate. I think that two or three days will put them all in good order. I turned in at Haxall's Landing 341 horses unfit to make the return trip. My total loss in horses will not exceed 400, including killed in battle and abandoned on the road shot. But few animals were obtained in the country. My losses in killed and wounded from the 9th to the 25th of May are as follows, viz: Total killed, 46. Wounded: Saved, sent to general hospital from Haxall's Landing and White House, 210; very slight and returned to duty, 75; mortally, left in farm-houses on road, 40; badly, and captured by the enemy, 54; total, 379.* The 210 wounded sent to general hospital were transported in a captured train of rebel ambulances and ordnance wagons and the ordnance wagons of the corps.

The officers and men of the corps are in excellent spirits.

I have on hand and ready for issued seven days' rations of subsistence for the men of the corps and a little less than one day's forage for the horses. My empty wagons should be permitted to go back for forage at once.

I would be pleased to call in person upon the major-general commanding if he will grant the permission.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S.-My total loss in captured by the enemy is between 75 and 80.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
