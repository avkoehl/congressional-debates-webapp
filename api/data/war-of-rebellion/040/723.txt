SALEM, April 15, 1863.

Major General SAMUEL JONES:

I can furnish about 1,000 men for immediate service, but not more than 300 of them are armed. The men who went with me on my late expedition have not returned yet, and they would not be fit for service if they were here. Colonel Dunn's battalion, who were ordered to report to Colonel Jackson, were in part armed from the balance of the command.

A. G. JENKINS,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA, Dublin, April 15, 1863.

Colonel [McCAUSLAND?]:

The major-general commanding directs you to suspend the movement ordered for the 17th instant until you receive further instructions, and meanwhile hold your command ready to move in any direction.

Very respectfully, colonel, your obedient servant,CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA, Dublin, April 15, 1863.

General S. COOPER, Richmond:

General Jones left here yesterday for Lewisburg, to complete the arrangements for another move. Sent couriers after him immediately. Will be back to-day, I presume. The Sixty-third [Virginia] Regiment is at Saltville, but lacks transportation. Can that ordered to Rappahannock by the Secretary of War for commissary stores be taken? One regiment and two large battalions at the Narrows, but also need transportation.

The troops remaining at Salem are nearly all without arms, the Ordnance Department having been unable to furnish them. I fear I have no troops that can be pushed far enough to aid Marshall in time.

Please instruct me.

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA, April 15, 1863.

Brigadier General JOHN S. WILLIAMS,Glade Spring:

Have your command ready to move as soon as possible. Report when ready, but do not move until further orders.

By order.

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
