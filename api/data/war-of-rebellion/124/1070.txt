Average ratio of enrollment to male population, 19.4 per cent.

It will be seen from this table that the States showing the larger rations of enrollment to male population are:

First. Those to which the more recent immigration has been most considerable, having in view immigration both from foreign countries and that resulting from the movement from the Atlantic States westward. Under this head Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota are examples.

Second. Those States having large cities, to which able-bodied men resort for employment, especially those near the depots of foreign immigration, in which males from abroad remain upon landing, or to which they most readily find their way. New Jersey, in which the ratio of enrollment to male population is 20 per cent., is an example of this, its cities and manufacturing towns--Newark, Jersey City, Trenton, &amp;c.-furnishing employment for the unskilled labor of immigrants as well as to the "journeymen" class of the native population. The State of New York also is a more remarkable instance under this head. That State contains the chief depot of foreign immigration, and, as well, a metropolitan district with a population of more than a million, to which men in the prime of life are attracted from neighboring States.

The States showing the smallest percentage of enrollment with reference to male population are those most strictly rural, such as New Hampshire, 16 3\4 per cent; Vermont, 15 per cent.; Delaware, 14 3\4 per cent; these at the same time being States which are but slightly affected by the waves of foreign immigration, while they are also
