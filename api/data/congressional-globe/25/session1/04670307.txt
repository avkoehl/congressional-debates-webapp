Making public officers depositories—Mr. Pope.
H. of Reps.
them í te question oí domestic slavery is one over which
each State mu3t be left to exercise sovereign control subject to
the power of Congiess inrefeience to the importation of slaves
from abroad
The tariff is oftea mentioned, too, h re certainly foreign to
the subjects of oui present delibeiations Permit me, Mr
Chairman, (said Mr Pipe,) to retiospect the histoiv of ttnsta
riff policy for the last thirty years N aily thirty years ago he
was a member of the other blanch of Congress, and gentlemen
from the Sou h and West, with the exception of Mr John Ran
dolph, and perhaps a few others, favoied the tariff policy, and,
m accordance with the expressed or imputed opinions of Mr
Jefferson, advocated the policy of renden ig this country, to a
great extent, independen oí the workshops of Europe I well
recollsct (said Mr Pope) that I united m this opinion without
having ever considered deeply the effects of this policy on the
different sections oí the Union 1 ne peop'e of the Eastern
States were at the t me more inclined to employ their capital m
commerce than manufacturer, and Mr Hillhonse, a senator
iiom Connecticut a nan of pravticil wisdom remarked to me
with appai cnt candor ¿rid much earnestness, that it was wrong to
ferceor stimulate manu actuies prematu ely that they ougnt
and would grow up gi idualiy with tn 'iowth tf the nation
Circumstances ll nvevei, turned a laige pom >n of El timet
pitil into manulactunng estailishn ents, and the Eastern peo
pie, eier astute and sagacious in whatever concerns their m'e
íes , asked for protection—more and more p,otectlon, until the
Sou h, awakened to a sense of the efects of tins pr tective po
licy on the planting S ates, changed their com se and resisted
this protective po icy, wht h at one time gave rise to a mostean
gry and excited contest Fortunately for om peaeeajdhir
mony, the q jestion was compiomised by the agency of a Ken
tucky membn of tin  House, and a distinguished Senator <rom
the same Slate they, at leas!, aided much m restoring quiet to
the country, aid 1 hope that comprt mise will not bedistmb
ed, and tha until t íe vetr 1842 this matter will be at rest It
is very pr ibable that the tariit p die y was ea r le 1 t hi fdi Ken
tuckyisa consumir g ¡state, as much "o as Vngun i and many
othei Southern States, and while sne admits the power and po
licy of giving reasonable protection to American industry, she
will be among the last to support, knowingly, any policy tend
lug to sacrifice the mteiest of the South to advance oraggran
dize any other portion of the Union He would, howevei take
leave to remark tha he believed at no distant day "Viiffmia

grave and candid consideiauon of thib committee, whether it
properly belongs to the Legislature or tl e Lxecutiv e atlthout}
0 create or select the agent to keep and guard the mon yoftbe
people, until drawn out m confoimity to appellations made
by law1 Is the Executive or Legislature the keepei and fniar
dian of the publ c treasure? In practice? the first Bank of the
United ¡states was the chief agt nt in taking care of the public
money, and the last bulk was made the agent by legislative au
thorny, and that both were safe and responsib e agents, is as
certained by the fact that no loss was evei sustained while they
had the caie of it, whereas we know that numerous defalca
tions and frauds and peculations have been committed by col
lectors receivers and others charged withthe care of the pub
lie revenue Laige sums confided to individuals furnish temp
tations too strong foi poor weak human nature Treasurers in
Viigmia and Kentucky, of the fairest charactei for purity and
honoi, afford stiong proofs of the danger of confiding large sums
of money to the care of individuals and both States have di
reeled the public money to be placed in sound a id responsible
bank8 When it is deposited m a bank, to the ciedit of the
Go enment the whole corp >ration is resporsible The capí
tal of tfmty five millions of dollars of the late Bank of the
United S ateswas bound foi t^e money placed m its vaults
I will not, said Mr Pope, detain the committee by any calcu
1 tt m of theat1 litional expense, or Executive patronage of this
newscieme ofSio Treasuries, because it is liable to o hei ob
fee ions of much more magnitude To what responsibility,
Mr Jfhairman (slid Mr Pope ) do you look for the security
ol the public revenue Do you íelyon the bondsand securities
provided form tins bill! Kemembei, (said he) that treiewill
be col ecfeJ in tlie city of New \ oí k afone, frorr twelve to fif
een millions tn 1 that m the cities of líos on, Ph ladelphia
Ba'timo e, Chaileston, and New Oileans, from three to five
mill orison an average will te received fey the collectors at
each port, and a laige amount of this money must remain foi a
considerable time in their hands befoie itcan be paid out In
the who e of these s ib Tieasunes, there will generally be on
hmd from five to ten millions of do'lars Now, sn what indi
vidua! and sectuittes can be good and responsible for million-^
Sir, you have no security for the safety ol the public funds, but
m the honoi and integrity of the officers charged with the caie
of them
I have, Mr Chairman, other 'ears and objections in relation
to this measure f tie officers to have chaige of your money
will be the creatures of the Executive, hoi ling their offices at
his pleasuie an* re ponsible directly to him We all know
(saiti Mi Pope) that money has become a powerful agent m
o t political contests and especially m the lai ge cities I et me
s ipp se a violent party contest for the Pres dential office, an 1

friends if powei to use the public m mey to enauie the elec
tionof then favoriteeat dilatei I cannot (said Mr Pope) think
of a seh"nie mine likely to be fatal to the puil'y t f ou msli u
tioas aid the pub'ic liberty, than the one on your talle I
deem it said he a most saciedduty of the ropieseitatlves of
the people to p'ace the money diawn by their authority from
their constituents m safe hands and not wheic it will be in
dangei of bein  wasted an 1 plundeied The guaidianslup anl
care of the public treasure belongs to Congtess, and not to the
Executive Acting upon this principle and in accordance with
the genins ofour fiee mstitutiins, the people of Kentucky, in
c invention, provided that the Treasurei of the State, who was
to b  charged with the caie of the puahc money, should be
elected by the I eglolatuie, while the appointment of all other
officers was t onfided to the Govpmoi and Senate
This measure seems designed to substitute an exclusive me

in relation to thlssubje t There is no doubt that the extensive
and cxtrav igant speculations in the public lands diverting
twenty or thnty oi forty millions of dollars from the ordmuy
channel  of tiale and business may have had some influence
