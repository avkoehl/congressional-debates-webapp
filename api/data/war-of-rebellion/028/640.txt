HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,Camp near Winchester, Va., October 1, 1862.

Major General GUSTAVUS W. SMITH,

Commanding, &amp;c., Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: The main army of General McClellan for the present seems disposed to be inactive. It will require some time for it to recover from the battles of Boonsborough and Sharpsburg, in which they must have lost heavily. the main body of the army seem,s to be stationed at Sharpsburg and hagerstown. General Sumner's corps is said to be at Harper's Ferry, and General Sigel's on the Potomac east of the Blue Ridge. They are reconstructing the brigades at Harper's Ferry, and are said to be building block-houses on Loudoun Heights. From their preparations, I should judge they intended to advance up the valley. When they will be ready I cannot say. The occasional movements they make from Harper's Ferry and Shepherdstown are intended, apparently, to gain information. Colonel Munford, who, with his cavalry, is in Leesburg, reported yesterday that nothing of importance was transpiring in that quarter. Whatever movement they do make into Virginia this fall, I think they will make a vigorous effort to destroy the Central Railroad, especially if they determine to advance up this valley, as they consider that this army is dependent on that road for its supplies. Colonel Chambliss reports from Warrenton Junction that about a brigade of infantry of the enemy, with artillery and cavalry, is now at Manassas. That force is no doubt intended to watch that region, but it may also make an attempt upon Gordonsville. Have you anything to resist it, or can you make arrangements to do so?

We are gathering in our stragglers slowly. If our ranks were full we should have force enough for our operations. Please send on convalescents and conscripts.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
