Answer. Part of them.
Question. What then took place between you ?
Mr. STANBERY. What do you propose
to prove, Mr. Manager?
Mr. Manager BUTLER. What took place
between the President and this witness.
Mr. STANBERY. Has it anything to do
with this case?
Mr. Manager BUTLER. Yes, sir.
Mr. STANBERY. Under what article?
Mr. Manager BUTLER. As to the intent
of the President in the several articles.
Mr. STANBERY. To do what?
Mr. Manager BUTLER. To oppose Con-
gress. [To the witness.] Will you go on, sir?
What did he say?
Answer. He said my claims for Government
employment were good, or worthy of atten-
tion ; I will not fix the words.
Question. What next?
Answer. He inquired about my political
sentiments somewhat, noticing that I was not
a political man or not a politician. I told him
I was a Union man, a loyal man, and in favor
of the Administration ; that I had confidence
in Congress and in the Chief Executive. He
then asked me if I knew of any differences be-
tween himself and Congress. I told him I
did; that I knew some differences on minor
points. He then said: "They are not minor
points."
Question. Go on, sir?
Answer. And the "influence" or "patron-
age"—I am not sure which—"of these offices
shall be in my favor." That was the mean-
ing.
Question. Were those the words?
Answer. I will not swear that they were the
words.
Question. " Shall be in my favor." What
did you say to that?
Answer. I remarked that under those con-
ditions I could not accept an appointment of
any land, if my influence was to be used for
him in contradistinction to Congress, and re-
tired.
Cross-examined by Mr. Staxijery:
Question. Do you know a gentleman in this
city by the name of Koppel?
Answer. I do, sir.
QueMion. Have you tallied with him since
you have been in the city ?
Answer. I have called on him when I first
came in the city ; I have seen him frequently.
Question. Did you tell Mr. Koppel yesterday
morning that all you could say about the Presi-
dent was more in his favor than against him ?
Answer. I did not, sir.
Question. Did you teli Mr. Koppel that when
you were brought up to be examined since you
arrived in this city there was an attempt to
make you say things which you would not say?
Answer. I did not, sir. 1 might, in explana-
tion of that question, say that there was a mis-
understanding between the Managers and a
gentleman in Boston in regard to an expression
that they supposed I could testify to, but that
I could not.
Question. Have you been examined before

ment.
Question. Was your testimony taken down ?
Answer. It was.
Question. Were you examined or talked to
by any one of -them before your examination
under oath?
Answer. I had an informal interview with
two of them before I was examined. 1 could
haydly call it an examination.
Question. Which two of them, and where?
Answer. By Governor Boutwell and Gen-
eral Butler.
Question. When?
Answer. Monday of this week.
_ Question. Did you say to Mr. Koppel that
since you have been in the city a proposition
was made to you that, in case you would give
certain testimony it would be for your ben-
efit?
Answer. I did not, sir.
Reexamined by Mr. Manager Butler :
Question. Who is Mr. Koppel?
Answer. Mr. Koppel is an acquaintance of
mine on the avenue—a merchant.
Question. Whatsortofmerchandise,please?
Answer. He is a manufacturer of garments—•
a tailor. [Laughter.]
Question. Do you know any sympathy be-
tween him and the President?
Answer. I have always supposed that Mr.
Koppel was a southern man in spirit. He
came from Charleston, South Carolina, here—
ran the blockade.
Question. Do you mean that as an answer
to my question of sympathy between the Pres-
ident and him ?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. The counsel for the President has
asked you if you told Mr. Koppel that you had
been asked to say things which you could not
say, or words to that effect. In explanation
or answer of the question you said there was a
misunderstanding which you explained to Mr.
Koppel. Willyou have the kindness to tell us
what that misunderstanding was which you
explained to Mr. Koppel ?
Mr. STANBERY. We do not care about
that.
Mr. Manager BUTLER, (to the counsel for
the respondent.) You put in apart of the con-
versation. I have a right to the whole of it.
Mr. STANBERY. We did not put it in at
all—only a certain declaration.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. A certain declara-
tion out of it, that is a part of the conversation.
Mr. STANBERY. Go on in your own way.
Mr. Manager BUTLER, (to the witness.) I
will ask, in the first place, did you explain the
matter to him ?
Answer. I did.
Question. Tell us what the misunderstand-
ing was which you explained to him in that
conversation?
Answer. I think, sir, a gentleman from Bos-
ton wrote you that the President asked me if
I would give twenty-five per cent, of the pro-
ceeds of any office for political purposes. I
: told you that 1 did not say so ; the gentleman
1 in Boston misunderstood me. The President
!' said nothing of the kind to me. I explained
j! that to Mr. Koppel, he probably having mis-
! understood it.
Question. Did you explain where the misun-
derstanding arose ?
Answer. I told him that I supposed it must
have occurred in a conversation between the
gentleman in Boston and myself.
Question. In regard to what?
Ansioer. In regard to the twenty-five per
cent.
Question. Where did that arise ?
Mr. STANBERY. What about all that?
Mr. Manager BUTLER. I am getting this
conversation between Mr. Koppel and this man.
Mr._ STANBERY. Not at all. You are
speaking about another transaction.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. No; lam:
you if you explained to Mr. Koppel where the
idea came from that you were to give twenty-
five per cent.
_ Mr. EVARTS. We object, Mr. Chief Jus-
tice. The witness has stated distinctly that
nothing occurred between the President and
himself, and it is certainly quite unimportant
to this court what occurred between this wit-
ness and another gentleman in Boston.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. I pray judgment
again upon this. The other side seek to put
in the conversation between a "tailor down in
Pennsylvania avenue or somewhere else and
this witness. I want the whole of that conver-
sation. I supposed, from the eminence of the
gentlgman who asked the question, that the con-
versation between Mr. Koppel, the tailor, and
this witness, was put in for some good purpose;
and, if it was, I want the whole of it.
Mr. EVARTS. The fact is not exactly as
is stated by the learned Manager. In the priv-
ilege of cross-examination the counsel for the
President asked this witness distinctly whether
he had said so and so to a Mr. Koppel. The
witness said that he had not, and then volun-
teered a statement that there might have been
some misunderstanding between Mr. Koppel
and himself upon that subject, or some misun-
derstanding somewhere. Our inquiries did not
reach or ask for or bring outthe misunderstand-
ing. But, passing that point, we stand here dis-
tinctly to say that everything whieb relates to
any conversation or interview between the Pres-
ident and this witness, whether as understood
or misunderstood, has been gone through, and
the present point of inquiry and further testi-
mony is as to the ground of misunderstanding
between this witness and some interlocutor in
Boston, and we object to its being heard.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. Which he explained
to Mr. Koppel, is the point.
Mr. EVARTS. That makes no difference.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. Having put in a
part of Mr. Koppel's conversation, whether
voluntarily or not, I have the right to the whole
of it. 1 will explain to the gentlemen that I
wish to show that the misunderstanding was
not that the President said the twenty-five per
cent, was to be given, but one of his friends.
There is where the misunderstanding arose.
Do the gentlemen still object?
Mr. STANBERY and Mr. EYARTS. Of
course we object. It has nothing to do with
the case.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. I will not press it
further. That is all, Mr. Wood.

appointment?

charge on the 16th day of September, 1865.
