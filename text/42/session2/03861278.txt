So the House refused to adjourn.
Mr. HOLMAN, I ask unanimous consent
to submit an amendment to this bill, so as to
give this company 
Mr. HOAR. I object.
Mr. HAZELTON, of Wisconsin. An amend-
ment to the bill would carry it back to the Sen-
ate, and would defeat it.
Mr. STEVENSON. Is it in order now to
move to lay the bill upon the table ?
The SPEAKEK. It is not in order. A
motion to lay the bill upon the table is in order
at each stage, but a motion to adjourn does not
place the bill in a different condition.
Mr. STEVENSON. Have we not passed
from the stage of the bill at which the last
motion to lay on the table was made ?
The SPEAKER. The stage of the bill now
is that the main question has been ordered to
be put but has not been put.
Mr. STEVENSON. 1 move that when the
House adjourns to-day it adjourn to meet on
Friday next.
Mr. HOLMAN. I hope my amendment
may be read, so that the gentleman may
understand it.
Mr. IIOAK. I object.
Mr. RUSK. "What is the object of adjourn-
ing over ?
Mr. HOLMAN. So that we may have time
to examine this bill, and see that the North-
ern Pacific Railroad Company would not get
one acre of this land if this bill does not pass.
Mr. COX. And also to enable gentlemen
to read the President's message on this point.
The question was put on Mr. Stevenson's
motion; and there were—ayes 40, noes 87.
Mr. STEVENSON called for the yeas and
nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. SPEER, of Georgia. Would a motion
to adjourn be in order just at this time ?
[Laughter.]
The SPEAKER. It would not. No motion
can take precedence of the pending motion.
The question was taken ; and there were—
yeas 32, nays 129, not voting 79 ; as follows :
