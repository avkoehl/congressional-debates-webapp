CITY POINT, VA., July 5, 1864 - 11. 50 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

Your dispatch of 12. 30 [1] p. m. received. I have ordered to Washington the dismounted cavalry and one division of infantry, which will be followed by the balance of the corps, if necessary. We want now to crush out and destroy any force the enemy have sent north. Force enough can be spared from here to dot it. I think now there is no doubt but Ewell's corps is away from here.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 5, 1864 - 1 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

GENERAL: The following information obtained from two deserters who came in this morning is sent to you for what it is worth. They state it to be currently reported at Richmond and in Petersburg that Early, in command of two divisions of Ewell's corps, with Breckinridge's command and other forces, was making an invasion of Maryland with a view of capturing Washington, supposed to be defenseless. It was understood Early would reach Winchester by the 3rd instant.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., July 5, 1864.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

The enemy have got to the Baltimore and Ohio road and have destroyed the railroad bridges from Patterson's Creek to Harper's Ferry. Send on one good division of your troops and all the dismounted cavalry, to be forwarded at once. I will not send an army corps until there is greater necessity for it. I will, order the quartermaster here to have transportation ready.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., July 5, 1864.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding, &c.:

Sigel has fallen to Maryland Heights, destroying the bridges at that point. Some of Hunter's force have arrived at Patterson's Creek, where they drove the enemy. Other dispatches are just coming through, which, when deciphered, I will inform you of, if they contain anything of importance. Among them I see the announcement of the sinking of the Alabama by your Navy. Semmes, however, escaped. Vessels will be ready for the troops ordered from here between now and 2 p. m. to-morrow. No artillery need be sent.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
