Copies of the same are respectfully transmitted, herewith inclosed.*

Major General F. J. HERRON,

Commanding, &amp;c., Baton Rouge, La.:

Three thousand infantry, under General Dennis, will be at Port Hudson to-night. Two hundred cavalry and a battery will be added from the forces at Port Hudson. The troops will be ordered to leave Port Hudson with five days' rations, to take no transportation, and to be equipped as lightly as possible. Make your own arrangements; but bear in mind that whatever is to be done must be done quickly, and that nothing is intended beyond destroying or driving off Scott's force and capturing or destroying depots of supplies that he may have established, and any other damage that it may be in your power to inflict.

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.

BATON ROUGE, August 23, 1864-3.30 p. m.

Brigadier-General ANDREWS,

Commanding Port Hudson:

Have you a field battery ready for service, and how many cavalry that are in shape to move?

F. J. HERRON,

Major-General, Commanding.
