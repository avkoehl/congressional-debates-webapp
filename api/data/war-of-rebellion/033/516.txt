OFFICE CHIEF COMMISSARY OF SUBSISTENCE, DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,

September 9, 1863.

Respectfully furnished Major-General Schofield, for his information and action.

In my opinion, subsistence supplies can be furnished General Steele's command from Memphis or Helena to better advantage than direct from Saint Louis. I have plenty at Helena to supply him, and will keep an ample supply there if the general commanding so directs.

T. J. HAINES,

Colonel and Chief Commissary.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, September 8, 1863.

Major-General POPE, Milwaukee, Wis.:

It has been found necessary to re-enforce General Steele immediately with troops from Missouri. You will, therefore, send to Saint Louis without delay all the regiments you can spare, to report to General Schofield, to temporarily replace those which eh sends south.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

MEMPHIS, TENN.,

September 8, 1863-12 midnight.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I informed Steele ten days ago that I would send him another brigade of infantry, if he called for it. This brigade will be taken from Memphis. General Stephen D. Lee has taken command of North and Central Mississippi. Pillow is at Columbus, organizing conscripts; [S. W.] Ferguson, with about 4,000 men and ten pieces of artillery, at Okolona; advance at Baldwin. Northern Arkansas is quiet.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS CENTRAL DISTRICT OF MISSOURI,Jefferson City, Mo., September 8, 1863.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding Department of the Missouri, Saint Louis, Mo.:

GENERAL: Having learned that the notorious Captain Rucker associate of Jackman, had left the steamer Oglesby last evening about 5 miles above saint Aubert's, and, in company with 5 other men, landed on a sand-bar, with appliances for fishing, as a cloak to other movements, I sent 50 men from here by train, with orders to mass squads of 5 men at different points, and to cross the river to Saint Aubert's with 20 men. They found Rucker at Saint Aubert's, and, on his attempting to get into the brush, he was shot severely wounded. He was left in the hands of a doctor.

I am, truly, yours,

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
