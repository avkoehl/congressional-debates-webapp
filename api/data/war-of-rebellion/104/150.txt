Major General A. J. SMITH:

The commanding general directs me to transmit the following dispatch, received from the signal officer on your extreme right, and to call your special attention to the latter portion:

I learn on inquiry that Lieutenant Higbie was in error reporting that either of the batteries in this locality have fired. No guns have been fired from any of the batteries. The shots fired from Battery Huger passed from one-quarter to one-half mile to the right as yesterday. No shots have been fired in this direction. I have still to report that many of the men on the batteries expose themselves to view in a needless manner. The boats are in the same position as yesterday.
