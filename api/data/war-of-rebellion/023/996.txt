CHATTANOOGA, August 27, 1862.

Major General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE:

MY DEAR GENERAL: We leave for your beloved home. Would that you were with us. Your division is ready as soon as you join, but you must hurry up to overtake us. Buell is anxious, apparently, to get to Cincinnati before us, but we envy him the honor. General [Samuel] Jones has orders to organize, arm, and equip all stragglers, recovered sick, and those from leave, and have them ready to join you. The quartermaster's department has orders to be ready to send you on. Move with 100 rounds of ammunition and twenty-five days' rations. We go by way of Sparta and Burkesville into the heart of Kentucky.

Yours, most truly,

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General, Commanding.

[SEPTEMBER 15-24, 1862. - For orders, &amp;c., transferring Breckinridge's division from Mississippi to East Tennessee, see Series I, Vol XVII, Part II, pp.703, 704, 706, 900.]

GLASGOW, KY., via CHATTANOOGA.

(Received Holly Springs, September 17, 1862.)

Major General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE:

Relying on your co-operation, our spare arms were left to be escorted by you. We are sadly disappointed without them, and Kentucky would [with them] be safe. I trust you are not sick.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

HOLLY SPRING, MISS., September 17, 1862.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

(To be sent from Chattanooga.)

I have been detained by orders here, but I leave in a day or two, via Chattanooga. Will bring your arms, and will move with great speed.

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General, C. S. Army.
