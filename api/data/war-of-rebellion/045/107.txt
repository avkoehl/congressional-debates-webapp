Colonel G. H. SHARPE,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

Hogan and Carney just returned from other side of river; crossed near Field's Ford. Their reports confirm last statements from Mount Holly. Dense clouds of dust were seen yesterday on the other side. Troops seemed moving toward Blue Ridge. Have you any directions to give me? Smith has gone to Washington, thinking he could be of no use to me.
