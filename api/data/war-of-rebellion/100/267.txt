HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI.

Raleigh, April 20, 1865.

Major-General WILSON, Commanding Cavalry, U. S. Army in Georgia:

General Joseph E. Johnston has agreed with me for an universal suspension of hostilities, looking to a peace over the whole surface of our country. I feel assured that it will be made perfect in a few days. You will therefore desist from further acts of war and devastion until you hear that hostilities are renewed. For convenience of supplying your command may either contract for supplies down about For Valley or the old Chattahoochee arsenal, or, if you are south of West Point, Ga., in the neighborhood of Rome and Kinston, opening up communication and a route of supplies with Chattanooga and Cleveland. Report to me your position through General Johnston, as also round by sea. You may also advise General Canby of your position and the substance of this, which I have also sent round by sea. *

W. T. SHERMAN,Major-General, Commanding.

Please communicate the above to office Federal commander.
