taken say that there is no second line. The commanding general may call on you to move forward at any moment, and wisher you to have your troops well up to the front, prepared to move. do the enemy's lines in front of Mott's division appear to be thinly occupied, and is there any chance to push forward there?

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, July 30, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

It is not possible to say about the line in front of General Mott, as both parties keep down, firing whenever a head is shown. General Ord left word for me with General Mott that there was no place to assault here, as the line was not only protected by abatis but by wire. This was the decision of himself and his division commanders, and he requested General Mott to so inform me. I know nothing more about it. I will be prepared for your orders.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, July 30, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

I have directed General Mott to advance a skirmish line to see whether the enemy hold a strong line in his front.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, July 30, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

The brigade next to General Burnside attempted an advance of a skirmish line just now, and lost the officer in command of the line and several men in merely getting over the parapet. The enemy's mortars are at work, but they are not firing much artillery other than this. The other brigades have not yet been heard from.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,Major-General.

Your dispatch is just received.* I will continue to watch the enemy in front.
