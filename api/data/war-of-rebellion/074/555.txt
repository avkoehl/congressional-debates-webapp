In compliance with orders, my command moved in the direction of Lovejoy's Station, taking such roads as could be found or made parallel to the main road occupied by the Fifteenth Corps. Upon arriving in the vicinity of Lovejoy's Station my command was placed in position on the extreme right of the army, where it was intrenched and skirmishers pushed promptly to within 400 yards of the enemy's works. With some unimportant changes of position my command remained here under a heavy skirmish fire until the evening of the 5th, when, in conjunction with the main army, I moved back to Jonesborough, and thence on the 6th and 7th to the vicinity of East Point, from which, on the 8th, my command was moved to the Macon and Atlanta road, where, after several changes, it was finally put in position and is now busily engaged in intrenching.

Attacked please find list of casualties in this command from June 10 to date; also reports of all subordinate officers of the part taken by their respective commands in the various actions in which they have been engaged.

In closing this report I desire to call the attention of the major-general commanding to the patience, perseverance, and courage of the officers and men of this command, who, after a rapid march of over 300 miles, over a new and difficult country, entered upon all the fatigues of an active campaign without a day's rest; their unremitting toil in digging breast-works and marching from one extreme of the army to the other, and their unparalleled gallantry in battle, particularly that of the 22nd of July.

I also commend the officers of my staff to the attention of the general commanding. To their efforts I am in a great measure indebted for the successful campaign of this corps which has just closed.

I desire to renew my recommendations for the promotion of Brigadier General M. D. Leggett, Brigadier General Giles A. Smith, Colonel B. F. Potts, Thirty-second Ohio Volunteers, and Colonel A. G. Malloy, Seventeenth Wisconsin Volunteers, and to call attention to the gallantry, ability, and energy of Brigadier General C. R. Woods, who has, since the 24th August, been in command of the Third Division of this corps. I understand he has already been recommended for promotion by Major-General Logan, and will, therefore, only add my testimony to his merit.
