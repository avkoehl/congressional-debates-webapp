general commanding express at the time his regret and concern at such an event?

4th. At what time did General Polk get back to the battle-field on the 7th? Was it not after the general commanding has sent repeatedly for him to hurry up as fast as possible? Did he arrive any too soon for the desperate struggle then going on?

These facts being historical, General Bearuegard hopes you will find no objection to answer them as well as your recollection will permit. Should the report of General Polk (made so long after that and several other battles) contain the statements to, without entering into a discussion on the subject, the general commanding will feel compelled to write a supplementary report to establish the facts as they occurred, and which he believes to be as stated by General Jordan in his remarks of last summer to P. W. A. He inclose them to you herewith for your perusal, fearing you may not have seen them, and he desires them returned after being read.*

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. N. TOUTANT BEAUREGARD.
