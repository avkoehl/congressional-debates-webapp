WASHINGTON, MO., October 24, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING:

The bodies of Major Wilson and six men, captured at Ironton, have been found about fifteen miles southwest from this place on the old State road near Jeffrey's farm. Major Wilson was shot through the body several times. One of the bodies is supposed to be that of an artillery bugler, from the trimmings of his jacket. They were found by a man who was out gathering persimmons, who identified Major Wilson by papers found on his body. All documents found on these bodies are in the bands of Esquire Kleinbacker, of this county, and will be forwarded to you as soon as received here.
