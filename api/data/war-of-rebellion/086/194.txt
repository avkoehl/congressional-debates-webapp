FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 22, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICERS,

Paola, Lawrence, Mound City, and Fort Scott:

General Curtis had a severe fight to-day. The enemy attacked his right flank and was repulsed, General Curtis driving him westward. General Pleasonton is on the east and pressing the enemy toward Kansas. Some damage may yet be done to Kansas towns. The notorious guerrilla Todd was killed yesterday.

W. H. STARK,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 22, 1864.

Captain MOBLEY:

The dispatch ordering you to the front is revoked. For the present remain where you are.

W. H. STARK,

Lieutenant-Colonel, &amp;c.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 22, 1864.

Captain MOBLEY:

The general says return to Lawrence. Keep a sharp lookout for the enemy.

W. H. STARK,

Lieutenant-Colonel, &c.

LAWRENCE, October 22, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel STARK:

Your dispatches overtook me at Eudora. My command will be back by 3 o'clock. Have any guerrillas broken through our lines? Please send all news from front soon as received, or if any anticipated danger here.

R. D. MOBLEY,

Captain, Seventh Kansas State Infantry.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 22, 1864.

Captain INSLEY,

Fort Scott, Kans.:

Price has passed our forces and the head of his column is eight miles south of Kansas City. I would suggest to you whether it would not be a good idea for you to move all your teams and transportation west and north as far away as possible for them to get. You can judge on the spot.

THOS. A. DAVIES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

KANSAS CITY, October 22, 1864-6 p. m.

Captain INSLEY,

Fort Scott:

Stand. The enemy is flying, closely pursued. Your only safety is to remain and keep everything in the forts.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

(Same to commanding officers Paola and Olathe.)
