Colonel S. COOPER,

Adjutant-General's Office, Washington, D. C.:

DEAR COLONEL: There have been a good many rumors afloat in regard to the disposition General Twiggs intends making of the troops of this department, in the event of the secession of the State of Texas. It is possible this may have reached the War Department. These reports are to the effect that it is the intention of the commanding general of the department to turn over to the State authorities all the Federal property within the borders of the State, on the requisition of the governor, and it is stated on good authority, or what is here considered good authority, that the general has so written to the governor.
