GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,

Numbers 10. Murfreesborough, Tenn., December 11, 1862.

* * * * * *

II. The country for miles around our military stations is full of officers and soldiers, visiting, loitering, and marauding. Many of them quarter themselves on the people of the country, claiming as a right that they should be entertained. Such parties are not only not authorized, but are denounced as highly pernicious to the discipline and efficiency of the army, and the general calls on commanding officers and citizens to aid him in the suppression of this evil.

Any non-commissioned officer or soldier found 1 mile from his camp without leave in writing, and any officer or soldier who shall be out of his quarters or camp without leave of his superior officer, is liable to trial and punishment, under the Forty-first and Forty-second Articles of War.
