APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

silver coin. The next step to be taken, in my
judgment, is the redemption at par of the legal-
tender notes in coin with the surplus gold in
the Treasury which is not needed to pay the
interest on the public debt. I believe that
the Secretary of the Treasury would be able
thus to redeem $10,000,000 every-sixty days.
The effect of selling gold by the United States
is to depreciate its own paper; and the effect
of the redemption of its own paper at par in
coin would be to appreciate the value of its
own paper. Gold is now at a premium of
about thirty-five cents on the dollar; and I
predict that, if the policy of this bill can be
adopted and carried into effect, upon the first
redemption of $10,000,000 of legal-tender
notes in coin at par by the Secretary of the
Treasury gold will not be worth more than
twenty-five cents premium on the dollar. If
such should be the result the purchasing power
of the $356,000,000 of greenback currency now
outstanding would be appreciated to the ex-
tent of about thirty-five million dollars. In
my judgment, after a few successive redemp-
tions of this character gold would not com-
mand a premium of ten cents on the dollar,
and thus the purchasing power of the green-
back currency of the people would be in-
creased to an extent equal to about eighty
million dollars. And I cannot see why under
this process our legal-tender money cannot be
brought to a par with gold. I propose by this
bill, Mr. Speaker, that the Secretary of the
Treasury shall issue $356,021,073 of new legal-
tender notes, to be substituted for the legal-
tender notes now outstanding, the new notes
provided by this bill to be issued in series, com-
mencing with number one and progressing to
number thirty-six, containing in each series
$10,000,000, with the exception of the last,
which shall contain but $6,021,073; so that by
this bill I neither contract nor expand the cur-
rency, but simply substitute the new issue for
the old. And this is made necessary in order
that it may be issued in such series that it can
be redeemed in gold at par without favor to
any particular class of our citizens. The bill
further provides for the reissue of all the notes
so redeemed, thus preventing any contraction
of the currency. The rest of the bill cannot be
better explained than by reading sections five,
six, and seven. They are as follows:
Sec. 5. And be it further enacted. That the Secretary
of the Treasury shall cause the legal-tender notes
hereby authorized to bo issued in series, commencing
with series No.l and ending with series No.36. Each
ol the first thirty-live series shall contain $10,000,000,
and tb6 thirty-sixth shall contain $0,021,073; and
each of said scries shall be numbered consecutively,
commencing with No. 1 and ending with No. 36, and
upon the face of each note snail appear in plain
charactors the number of the series to which it be-
longs.
tSEOh. 6. And be it further enacted. That whenever
there shall havo accumulated in the Treasury of the
United States a sum in coin exceeding by $10,000,000
the amount which will bo required for tho paj rnent
of the interest on the public debt for the next ensu-
ing six months, it shall bo tho duty of tho Secretary,
and he is hereby directed, to redeem at par in com
at the Treasury of the United States or anysub-treas-
ury thereof as may be designated by the said Secre-
tary, tho whole of any one of said series; and the said
secretary shall cause each note so redeemed to be
stamped with tho word " redeemed," and shall add
thereto the day of the month and year of such re-
demption ; and tho said Secretary shall reissue such
redeemed notes in such manner as he is now author-
ized by law to reissuo legal-tender notes now out-
standing; Provided, That every note reissued shall
havo stamped upon its face tho word "reissued," and
in addition shall show the day of the month and year
of its reissuo.
Sec. 7. Anfrbe it further enacted, That the Secretary
of tho Treasury shall give at least ten days' notice
by publication in one or more of the newspapers in
each of the cities wherein a sub-treasury of the Uni-
ted States is ormay bo established, which notice shall
state the series which it is the intention of tho Secre-
tary to redeem, and at what time and place the re-
demption shall tako place.
Thus it will be seen, Mr. Speaker, that I
have provided against the hoarding of any par-
ticular series ; for no one will know what series
is to be redeemed, as they are not to be re-
deemed seriatim, commencing with No. 1
and going on through the series; but the Sec-
retary may call for any series he sees proper,
and if he is au honest SecVetary there can be
no special advantages bestowed upon any par-
ticular or favored class. This bill was referred
to the Committee of Ways and Means, and I
hope to be able to get the favorable action of
the House upon it before the close of this
session. But that will depend in a great meas-
ure upon the fact as to who- has the most
friends on that committee, the laboring masses
of the people or the rich, non-producing class.
]?or, as I understand it, the provisions of this
bill are in the interests of labor.
I will now call the attention of the House
to the other hill, which is entitled "A bill
supplementary to an act entitled ' An act to
provide a national currency secured by pledge
of United States bonds, and to provide for the
circulation and redemption thereof, approved
June 3, 1864, and for other purposes.'" I
referred this bill to the Committee on Bank-
ing and Currency, and I have no right to ex-
pect a favorable report from that committee;
for I fear that the members of that commit-
tee are too largely interested inbankingto vol-
untarily report a bill which interferes with the
.banking system as it is now established. I
intend, therefore, as soon as I can get the floor
for that purpose, to refer a like bill to the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means, with the hope that
it may be reported to the House at an early
day and that we may have action upon it.
Our national banking system is a close cor-
poration. The $300,000,000 of circulation
which was authorized to be issued ias all been
taken long since. How has that circulation
been distributed ? The table which I hold in
my hand will best answer that question :
Ponula- Sank circu~
States. tion, lation.
Maine  628,279 $7,511,283
New Hampshire  326,073 4,214,155
Vermont  315,098 5,710,480
Massachusetts  1,231,066 55,901,665
Rhode Island  174.620 12,470,230
Connecticut  460,147 17,432,823
•Total of New England  3,135,283 103,300,639
New York  3,880,735 69,209,277
NewJosey    672,035 9,131,965
Pennsylvania  2,906,216 38,839,030
Total of eastern States 10,593,268 $220,483,911
Ohio  2,339,511 $18,405,920
Indiana  1,350,428 11,015.040
Illinois   1,711,951 9,521.810
Michigan  749,115 3,822,425
Wisconsin  775,881 2,559,050
Iowa  674,915 3,230,090
Missouri  1,182,012 3,437,620
Kentucky  1,155,682 2,342,020
Tennessee  1,109,801 1,232,040
Total of western States 11,049,296 $54,566,015
Thus it will be seen that but $24,000,000 of
circulation is awarded to all the other States
not set out in the table, having in the aggre-
gate a population of ten millions. The State
of Massachusetts has fifty dollars per capita of
this circulation, Rhode Island sixty dollars,
while New York has but twenty-three dollars,
and Pennsylvania nineteen dollars. Illinois
has less than five dollars per capita. Massa-
chusetts, with apopulation of less than one mil-
lion three hundred thousand, has about fifty-six
million -dollars of circulation, while Illinois,
with a population exceeding two million
five hundred thousand, .has less than ten mil-
lion dollars of this circulation. The iniquities
of this unjust distribution I propose to remedy
by this bill, which repeals that clause of the
old law which limits the circulation of the
national banks to $300,000,000; thus making
it free banking system, as it should have been
from the beginning. The western States re-
quire more circulation than the eastern; for
the eastern States are comparatively well
developed, while the western States require
development. We are opening and cultivating
new farms, building factories, towns, cities,
and railroads. We of the West demand that
this outrageous inequality shall not be longer
continued, and that the distribution of this
circulation shall be equalized and that the West
and the South shall have their proper propor-
tions ; and that if this national banking system
is to be contioued the distribution of this cir-
culation shall be equalized.
Now, let us look at this matter a little fur-
ther. Does it come with a good grace from
gentlemen from Massachusetts to talk to the
Representatives from the West about a "re-
dundancy" of the currency, when their State
has monopolized fifty dollars per head of the
entire bank circulation, including every man,
woman, and child in the State, while in the
State of Illinois we have less than five dollars
per -head ? I answer it does not. Why, Mr.
Speaker, we may before long be called upon
to inquire "whether Massachusetts has a repub-
lican form of government." Is it republican, I
inquire, that one State of this Union with less
than thirteen hundred thousand population
shall monopolize one fifth of the entire bank
circulation of the country? The Represent-
atives from Massachusetts will do well to con-
sider this matter.
How shall we remedy this? I answer by
the adoption of this bill. This bill, as I have
said, proposes to make the banking system
a free one, whereby the West and the South
will be enabled to secure such an amount of
circulation as may be required for legitimate
business purposes. And they will ask for noth-
ing more, and I trust they will be satisfied with
nothing less.
How further would I reform this national
banking system? I am not making war upon
it, but I propose to improve it; and if those gen-
tleman who are interested in this banking sys-
tem wish to continue it they had better accept
this bill, or they may perhaps wake up some
morning to find that their national banking sys-
tem is numbered with the things that were.
The national banking system is now based upon
the Government bonds drawing five and six
per cent, interest, much the larger portion of
these bonds bearing six per cent, interest pay-
able in coin. The banks receive in circulating
notes in amount equal to ninety per cent, of
the bonds they deposit. This circulation these
banks loan out at a high rate of interest, and
now that any further issue of circulation to the
national banks is prohibited under the present
law they, in their supposed security, oppress
the people and enrich themselves at the ex-
pense of the masses and to the injury of the
great industrial interests of the country.
Let mo call the attention of the House to
some figures bearing upon this branch of the
subject. Do gentlemen of this House know
that none of these national banks make a re-
turn of their profits to the Comptroller of the
Currency? You cannot find in the report of
any national bank any statement as to the profit
which the bank realizes on the amount of its
capital invested. But I have taken such data
as I have been able to obtain, and have made
some calculations upon them which I think
are reliable. I will refer to these calculations,
and after gentlemen have heard them let us
see whether they will tell me that there is a
"redundancy of the currency," and that the
present banking system is all right.
The amount of the paid in capital of these
banksis$426,'000,000in currency. The amount
of the bonds on deposit for the security of their
circulation is $342,000,000. The amount of
bonds deposited as security for Government
deposits is between thirty and forty million
dollars more—making altogether a deposit of
bonds to the amount of $380,000,000. The
number of these banks is sixteen hundred and
forty-two, and their circulation about three
hundred million dollars. Now, let us see
whether their capital was actively employed.
The aggregate amount of their loans and dis-
counts for. the year 1867 was $3,351,000,000
upon a paid in capital of but $426,000,000!
and tho average time of each loan and dis-
