Brigadier-General McCOOK,Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: We have succeeded in capturing Jefferson Davis, his family, and several other important characters. Clement C. Clay came in and gave himself up. Alex. H. Stephens was taken at home. All are now en route for Washington. Davis left here last night at dark and passed through Atlanta at half-past 4 this morning. Breckinridge is still at large, and General Wilson is of the opinion that he has passed down between the Oconee and Ohoopee Rivers to reach Florida. The general desires that you will keep a sharp lookout for Breckinridge. Dispose of your duties at Tallahassee soon as possible and return to Macon, as it is probable the corps will move northward very soon. Scarcity of forage is threatening us, and we shall soon be compelled to leave this part of Georgia. It is impossible to give your orders at this distance, and everything is left to your own discretion as regards the disposition of prisoners, property, &amp;c.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. B. BEAUMONT,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
