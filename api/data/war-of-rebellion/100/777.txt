RALEIGH, N. C., April 10, 1865-10. 30 a. m.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Smithfield, N. C.:

Major Holmes reports yesterday from Greensborough that enemy is reported raiding again in Stokes Country, forty miles from that town. Colonel Wheeler reports from Henry County that enemy has been heavily re-enforced at Henry Court-House, and left that place early yesterday morning, mvoing toward Leasksville and Madison. These movements indicate evidently a raid on Danville railroad, and probably on Greensborough. Can ou spare any cavalry for their defense? Not time should be lost.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

J. E. JOHNSTON.
