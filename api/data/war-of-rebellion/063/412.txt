Commanding First Brigadier, Second Div., 19th Army Corps:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you proceed with your command to Fort De Russy, and that you take possession of and occupy that fort. If you find the enemy there you will drive him from it. At a point known as Wilson's Farm, 24 miles below Alexandria, the enemy has shown some artillery. You will, if possible, on your way down the river, reconnoiter this position and drive the enemy from it. You will consider the holding of Fort De Russy as the principal object, but you will also endeavor, as far as possibly, to keep the banks of the river free from the enemy. This might be done by sending detachments on gun-boats to such points as may be infested. You will endeavor to obtain as much information as possible regarding the enemy, and report fully and direct to these headquarters.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. DWIGHT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
