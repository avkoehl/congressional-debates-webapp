HDQRS. FIRST BRIG., SECOND DIV., THIRD CORPS, Camp near Beverly

Ford, Va., August 13, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to make the following report of the operations of my command from July 9 to 31, inclusive. My report of the campaign up to and including July 8 has already been rendered. On Thursday, July 9, Major Hamlin, assistant adjutant-general, turned over to me the command of the division, Brigadier-General Humphreys having accepted the position of chief of staff to the major-general commanding the army. The brigade moved at 5 a. m., and marched to Middletown, where rations were issued to the command. At 10 a. m. marched to South Mountain, where I halted until 6 p. m., at which hour we marched across the mountain, going into bivouac at 7. 30 p. m. At 6. 30 a. m. on Friday, July 10, I was relieved of the command of the division by Brigadier-General Prince, and resumed command of my brigade. Marched to Antietam, and bivouacked at 9. 30 p. m. At 10 p. m. the brigade was again in motion, and, after marching about 5 miles, went into bivouac at 2 a. m. On Saturday, July 11, at 6 a. m., advanced 2 miles to the front. At 4 p. m., again advanced 2 miles to the front, and bivouacked for the night. On Sunday, July 12, at 3 p. m., moved about 1 mile, and went into bivouac. At 5. 25 a. m. on Tuesday, July 14, moved to the support of the Twelfth Corps, about three-quarters of a mile to the front, and at 3 p. m. marched 1 mile and bivouacked.
