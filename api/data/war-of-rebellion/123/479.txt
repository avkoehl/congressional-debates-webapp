WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., August 28, 1862.

His Excellency Governor ROBINSON,

Governor of Kansas:

SIR: Your communication of the 20th of August, with accompanying paper forwarded by major Eldridge, has been received. In reply I send you a copy of the authority given to General lane for recruiting volunteers in Kansas.* The extent of that authority and how far the action of General Lane comports with it you can judge of as well as any one else. It is deeply regretted that there is any discord or ill feeling between the Executive of Kansas and the military commander and General Lane at a time when all men should be united in their efforts against the enemy, and if any way appeared by which the Department could establish harmony and unity of action it would be promptly pursued.

Your, truly,

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

Governor ROBINSON,

Frankfort, Ky.:

I regret that the Department cannot issue quartermaster's and ordnance stores to the State authorities and before the men are mustered in. If the rendezvous are exposed to danger, the place must be changed or sufficient guard supplied by the commander of the department.

Secretary of War.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

In organizing nine-months" regiments we meet obstacles at every step which can be remedied by a word from you, b ut are otherwise insurmountable. Captain Goodhue, eleventh Infantry, U. S. Army, U. S. Mustering and disbursing officer here, refuses to muster them into service, either men or officer, until they present themselves for muster by regiments. Concerning this I telegraphed you yesterday. To-day he refuses to furnish transportation of nine-months" militia recruits to camp, and there remains no way to get them there unless they pay their fare out of their own means. We have more than 5,000 nine-months" militia ready to go into service immediately, who have abandoned their avocations, and ask only to be received at once, but are repressed and discouraged by these refusals. Why cannot regulations as to muster and transportation of volunteers be applied also to militia? Why cannot mustering and disbursing officers be appointed by you who will co-operate hearty in the recruitment instead of inventing obstacles? If I were capable of discouragement I should be almost discouraged by the obstacles which block
