buffalo, but no hay. Has established the post. Has met no Indians, but saw plenty of heavy trails about one week old making toward line of march of center column. At Powder River he leaves his base-trains take stores to last until October-and pushes right north to Panther Mountain, following trail of Indians. His entire command, he says, is in excellent condition. He also sends long dispatches on the reduction of troops, Utah matters, &amp;c., which I will send You by mail; too long to telegraph.

FORT KEARNY, August 16, 1865.

Major General JOHN POPE,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

The cavalry force that went in pursuit of the Indians that attacked Big Laramie Station overtook them several days ago, gave them a thorough whipping, killing and wounding large number of the Indians, taking their stock and scattering them. They are still following them up in the mountains, and will effectually use up that band.

FORT KEARNY, August 16, 1865.

Captain GEORGE F. PRICE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Fort Laramie:

Where are the stores General Connor asks for? Have they not arrived at Fort Laramie? Where is the saw-mill? They all left Leavenworth long ago. You will se by the dispatch to General Connor what is to be done. What infantry is within him? I would send to him two companies of Sixth U. S. Infantry-four, if You think they can be spared. If they have to march a long distance before reaching Laramie we may hear from him, and if he knows where the escort to Colonel Sawyer's wagon-road party is he might get those troops when Colonel Sawyer is through with them, and it will save long marches.

Major-General.

FORT LARAMIE, DAK. TER., August 15 [16], 1865.

Major General G. M. DODGE,

Kearny:

Stores are arriving. Do not know where saw-mill is. One saw-mill was retained at Kearny by direction of the general. There is no infantry with General Connor, neither with any of his columns. Colonel Sawyer's escort consists of Companies C and D, Fifth U. S. Volunteers, and a detachment of twenty-five Dakota men, under command of Captain Williford, Fifth U. S. Volunteers. The route taken by the party will intersect the road from this place to Virginia City at or near Powder River. The escort will not be required by Colonel Sawyer after arriving at Big Horn River. Have just telegraphed these facts to General Connor, also Your information that companies are ordered to report to him.

GEO. F. PRICE,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
