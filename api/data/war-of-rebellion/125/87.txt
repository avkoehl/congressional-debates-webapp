ent cavalry organizations are adapted to over 200,000 cavalry, a number far beyond the capacity of the Government to support. Every State is anxious to raise cavalry, because it is easier to raise than infantry, while it is beyond all comparison more expensive to equip and support. Putting aside every other question, the finances of the Government will not admit of new cavalry organizations or the transfer of infantry into cavalry. You are as anxious as any one can be to get through this war without a financial catastrophe. In considering the matter in every point of view the General-in-Chief has reported in substance: First. That the existing cavalry organizations are sufficient, and, if filled up, would be more than the exigency of the war requires, and much greater than the Government can sustain. Cavalry enlistments to fill upu old regiments only can be received. Second. That new cavalry organizations are not needed, and would occasion an increased expense that cannot be justified.

Even now the Treasury cannot promptly fill all the requisitions. This Department, therefore, cannot authorize new organizations of cavalry, nor transfers of infantry into cavalry, beyond the actual authority given heretofore in one or two instances for special purposes. If General Gillmore has made transfers under proper authority they will not be altered if they have been carried into effect, but they cannot be extended beyond transfers actually consummated.

Colonel J. B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General:

In your telegram of 5th instant you say, "Would you like to undertake raising some other companies to be formed into a regiment when completed?" If you mean entire new companies, with officers, to be put into old regiments in the field, I do and would like to have such authority. Please answer.

Governor of Michigan.

MEMORANDA OF GOVERNOR PARKER, OF NEW JERSEY.

As I understand, the account now stands with New Jersey about as follows:

The recent order of the President is for draft (after

deducting credits) for ................................ 500,000

-------

New Jersey"e quota of that number is about ............ 16,000

To be credited all raised last summer, about .......... 5,000

Since then about ..................................... 6,000

--------

11,000

--------

Deficiency about ...................................... 5,000

But it is said that there was a former deficiency under

Governor Olden of about ............................... 12,000

--------

And if that is insisted upon, the deficiency would be

about ................................................. 17,000

I learn to-day for the first time that it is in contemplation to include that 12,000 in the draft ordered in March.
