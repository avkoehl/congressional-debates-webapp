1834.                                 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                                    85
effect, except to take the money across the streets
and bring it back again, it would have been a
most pernicious effect She had her eighteen mil-
lions of cuirency to sustain She could not keep
all her sads set, and throw all her ballast over-
board She was obliged to meet the payment by
curtaihrg her discounts, by calling upon her own
debtors This was the only safe or prudent course
for her to take When a bank calls upon her
debtors to return a part of the amount due to her,
every individual debtor who has a deposite in the
bank will necessauly draw upon it Two and
two do not always make four in a bank cur-
tailment. The curtailments of the bank made in
August, were in part met by the withdrawal of a
poition of the private deposites from the bank
Mr B then showed that the curtailment made
by the bank in August of four millions of dis-
counts drew from the community less than one
million The reduction might be very larg  and
the effect veiy small, and the bank, in his opin-
ion, ought to strengthen herself yet the curtail-
ments which had been made tended very little to
that object The whole amountof reduction from
August to January increased the means of the
bank only to the amount of the sum which the
Government took away
They are right who say that the removal of the
deposites from the bank did not produce the dis-
tiess, but it was the universal want of confidence
and stagnation produced by the measures neces-
sarily taken by the bank to pay the public depos-
ites     The object might have been accomplished
with ¡ess embarrassment to the community if the
Treasury Department had rendered it certain  at
what time and when the money should be paid
But the bank found that it had to deal with an
enemy, who sought to come upon it by surprise
and in the dark    The daily and weekly lists of
sums deposited by the Government were discon-
tinued, and large drafts were sent without notice
Some of these were drafts to be paid on certain
contingencies, beyond the knowledge or control of
the bank     Every reflecting man must say that
the course of the Secretary of the Treasury, in
keeping these drafts hovenng between Baltimore
and Boston, to the amount of three millions, was
alone sufficient to account for the alarm of the
bank, and to render advisable a much larger
amount of  curtailment  than  was   resorted  to
When the removal of the public deposites to a
State bank in Philadelphia was made, «was found
not to be so valuable a present as was at first sup-
posed.   The private deposites lessened m the pro-
portion that the Government deposites increased,
for private individuals found that the Government
was a preferred depositor, and, in case of any dif
ficulty, would sweep the whole     Several other
views he presented, to show that the State banks
could not, so well as the United States Bank, dis
count upon the public deposites    The days of one
and one and a half per cerit were days of disaster
to both borrower and lender. There was (he spoke
from personal knowledge) a vast amount of pri-
vate capital in Boston, New York, and Philadel-
phia, ready to be loaned at five per cent   upon
security of stocks, but the universal want of con-
fidence  kept it out of the market     The great
amount of money in the country was employed
in bringing the crops to maiket, and m transport-
ing merchandise in exchange for the crops
I ask, what was the structure of the bank that
it could provide ateveiy point for the wants of the
Government, and at the same time promote the
interest of the country by carrying on their ex-
changes' But the bank having no share m the
deposites removed, but being obliged to distribute
them at any point, she must diminish her assist-
ance to the community The State banks, he con-
tended, could not pay the public deposites, and at
the same time assist the community Let them
try it, and in three months time they will give it
up or in violation of their charters, consolidate
their iehcs into a United States Bank The rem-
edy that was to be applied to this state of things
was appaient to every one—the restoration of the
deposites But the gentleman from Tennessee
wants a sifting inquiry before he acts upon the
question, a sifting inquiry must be had into the
miserable dnblets of printing accounts, and into
the fact whethei the National Intelligencer belongs
to the bank or not, while, in the meantime, the
great interests of the country are set aside and
neglected
The question for the consideration of the House
was whether the reasons adduced by the Secretary
of the Treasury were such as ought to be satis-
factory to Congress'   If not, then whether they
were not bound to consider if there was any, and
what remed y should be applied to avert the dangers
that were now more than apprehended to fall on
the country in consequence of his removal of the
deposites? It was necessary for him, then, to take
them as given, and here he would observe, and it
could not have escaped observation that the Sec-
retary of the Treasury had submitted various
propositions as the basts of his action, with a state-
ment of some particular facts, by which hejustified
that action    The arguments in the statement of
facts made for his justification were large and
numerous enough, whilst for the groundwork, the
basis, there was no argument at all, neither had
they been enlightened on this point by the honor-
able member [Mr  Polk] who had preceded him
[Mr B ] in the debate     The Secretary broadly
asserted that, whether he was right, or whether
he was wrong, he alone was authorized to remove
the deposites     The bank, by the removal, were,
in legal parlance, put out of court—m fact, they
were not entitled to a hearing as a party m the
cause.   For this, however, no reason was given
He next asserts, as another of his propositions,
that Congress tied themselves up by the act incor-
porating the bank, and in which they had given
him alone the absolute and unconditional power
of removal    So that if this assertion was founded
correctly, it must follow, as a matter of course,
that Congress could not interfere, with even the
best íeasons in the world for doing so—the very
safety of the deposites themselves—they could not
take this money from the bark     Another propo-
sition submitted by him was, that the removal hav-
ing even a tendency towards public convenience,
was sufficient for him in making the removal, and
he went further to say, that the power to remove
conferred the power to place the public money else-
where    But to sustain these various propositions
no argument was given  they rested on mere dog-
mas, and he could only, therefore, in the absence
I of an y argument to sustain them, proceed to discuss
i them negatively, and to show that if they were ex-
amined into attentively and admitted, it would be
conceding that which he believed the House never
would sanction   Mr B here proceeded to review
at length the reasons of the Secretary, and read
from his letter to Congress the passages in which
it was stated that, by repeated adjudications, the
chatter granted to the bank was in the natureof a
contract, and by which it was alleged by the Sec-
retary that the power reserved to the Secretary
over the deposites should not be restricted to any
particular contingency, but was absolute and un-
conditional, and thus, as he [M   B ] contended,
he must be supposed as assuming the ground that,
be his reasons for the removal right or wrong, it
could be no breach of the contract to remove the
deposites.
The Secretary admits that the bank obtained
their privileges for a consideration paid by them m
moneyand services, he must admit, also, that the
bank is still performing services in various ways
He says that the power is absolute, although it is
stated that the charter was in the nature of a con-
tract, one part of which was, that he was obliged
to report to Congress his reasons for any use of the
power given to him, but he [Mr B ] asked what
fair construction could be puton that obligation, if
it was not that Congress had a right to consider
those reasons > Why else was it required that they
should be given at all? This was the common
sense doctrine, and which is the legal doctrine, be
cause the law says exoressly that the reasons shall
concern the party whom they affect, and if this be
so, how could the Secretary be correct in asserting
that the bank had no concern in the reasons which
he was bound to furnish by the terms of what he
admits is a contract—a pecuniary contract, between
the stocltholders on the one part, and the sover-
eignty (the United States) granting it> He con-
tended that the bank being thus the admitted party
to a contract made, by which the Secretary was
bound to furnie-h h s reasons, he in compliance
with that obligation done no noie than hisduty, the
bank, then, w ere the party who were only concerned
in the sufficiency of these reasons, and ought to
have the justice examined into by the House He
found that this very right of the House was con-
ceded, in the communication read in the debate,
from Secretary Crawford to the House—one of the
charges made against him was, that he had re-
moved the deposites from the United States Bank
to the bank at Chihcothe, without communicating
his reasons for such removal to Congress Well,
then, did the Secretary of that day assume the
ground now taken' Did he not say, rather m terms,
that the omission was owing to inadvertence > And
what further> That this very provision—the sub-
mitting the reasons to Congress—" was intended
for the benefit of the bank " Mr Secretary Craw-
ford again admits that the reasons were to be com-
municated to Congress Why! Because it was
necessary that Congress should know where the
public money should be deposited He concluded,
therefore, and maintained, that the assertion that
the power of the Secretary was absolute and un-
conditional was not made out, was in the face of
this former precedent of Secretary Crawford, and
had only arisen from the very poverty of the case
He trusted that Congress would not sanction such
a principle as that, in a case of actual contract,
after a bonus had been paid by the bank, and ser-
vices rendered by them, estimated at nearly
$200,000 per annum, the Secretary could, for in-
sufficient reasons, thus commit what was a breach,
of the contract for which this bonus and services
were paid, and Congress, supposing his reasons
to be insufficient, had not power to bring the sub-
ject back, and reverse a decision which might be
proved to be contrary to ásense of common justice
The House had the right to inquire into these
reasons and into their justice They were bound
to do this, lest they might have been dictated by
caprice, and thus the public faith had been violated,
and the bank turned away from the enjoyment of
what was their purchased rights
The next proposition assumed by the Secretary
which he meant to discuss was, that the power
reserved to the Secretary did not depend for its
exercise on the safety of the money, or the fidelity
with which the bank had conducted itself, but
that he (the Secretary) had the right whenever
the public interest required it Mr B would,
I however, defer this until the next day, if favored
by the House with an adjournment
1     Mr MERCER rose and submitted a motion to
I that effect, which prevailed.
