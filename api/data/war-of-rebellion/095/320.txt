Numbers 135. Report of Asst. Surg. Samuel Adams, U. S. Army, Medical Inspector, of operations March 1-31.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,Before Petersburg, Va., March 31, 1865.

COLONEL: The following mediacl inspector's report for March is respectfully submitted:

The only thing of importance which has transpired since my last report has been the piercing of our lines at Fort Stedman and Batteries Nos. 10 and 11 on the morning of the 25th instant.

At 4.30 o'clock on the morning of the 25th instant the enemy made an assault on the lines at Fort Stedman in three columns; one column swept down to the left toward Battery Numbers 9, one to the right toward Fort Haskell, while a third moved forward directly toward Fort Stedman. The enemy had been coming in for several nights, bringing their guns and equipments with them; on this occasion they came in squads, as deserters to our pickets, and by this ruse the picket-line at this point was enveloped and captured before the alarm could be given to the main line. The pickets were active and on the alert, and had been visited by the officer of the picket, Captain Burch, Third Maryland Veteran Volunteers, at 4 a.m. There was no neglect or want of vigilance on the part of the pickets of this division. The attack was made on the Second and Third Brigades of the First Division, Major-General Willcox commanding. The alarm was soon conveyed to the main line, and the troops were ready and in line to meet the assault promptly. The enemy swept over the parapet and overpowered the garrison of Battery 10, killing and capturing the cannoneers at their guns; they then pushed forward to Fort Stedman, capturing its guns and the garrison, composed of one battalion of the Fourteenth New York Heavy Artillery. After breaking through the lines they came into the camps of the Fifty-seventh and Twenty-ninth Massachusetts and the One hundredth Pennsylvania Regiments, driving them from their quarters, and pushed forward their line of skirmishers to the road and hills in rear of Fort Stedman and nearly to Meade's Station. The Fifty-seventh Massachusetts fell back and reformed, acting as skirmishers. General Willcox ordered out the Seventeenth Michigan and the Two hundredth and Two hundred and ninth Pennsylvania to oppose the advance of the enemy toward Meade's Station, and the First Brigade of the Third Division (General Hartranft's) was ordered down from the left of the line at a double-quick.
