ing his troops. His dispatch to me was forwarded to headquarters with my dispatch last evening. If I furnish a temporary supply of the rations forwarded to me yesterday (which have not yet arrived) to General Palmer, my troops will be out of rations, too.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Jones' Ford, July 3, 1863.

Major-General NEGLEY,

Commanding Second Division:

Inclosed I send you a map* showing the direction your division and Reynolds' will take after crossing the river. You will see that it leads from the bridge where you now are, crosses the Winchester and McMinnville road at Pennington's, and from Pennington's, by Moore's, to Brakefield Point, at the foot of the mountains. The general commanding directs that after crossing the river at the bridge you halt at Pennington's until you receive further orders. Reynolds will follow you with his division. Rousseau and Brannan will take the road to your left, which runs nearly parallel with yours. Both roads come together at Brakefield Point, at the foot of the mountains. Send word back to me as soon as you arrive at Pennington's, reporting the condition of your command, roads, &amp; c.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

[GEO. E. FLYNT,]

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

The river is again on the rise, and it will be impossible to cross my troops without pontoons. Send down, say four, with the necessary balks and planks, or flooring.

Very respectfully,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Jones' Ford, July 3, 1863 - Noon.

Brigadier-General MORTON:

Your note of this morning just received. If you could send us four pontoons, we could cross here by to-morrow morning without any trouble. Perhaps the river may be low enough to-night to cross, even if we do not get the pontoons.

Very respectfully,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
