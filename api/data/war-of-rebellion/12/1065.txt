When his condition was reported to me I took measures to bring him off, but it was too late. The others who fell in the gallant discharge of their duty are to be envied the glory they have won. Our skirmishers captured and brought off several fine rifles and other trophies found in camp of the reserve of the enemys pickets. I herewith append a list of the casualties of my command, and beg leave especially to recommend to your notice the promptness, courage, and efficiency of the regiments engaged and their youthful command- ers, Colonels Kennedy and Nance.
