fifteen days. The average time of movement with all the change and difficulties encountered will not exceed ten days from the time troops leave the upper Tennessee to their arrival at their destination. To yourselves I beg leave again to express my obligations for the great promptness, energy, and efficiency of your services in so rapidly providing the necessary cars and in making the transfer at Cincinnati. Please let me hear from you at Washington, and advise me if anything is said anyway relative to the movement or injury to troops.

I am, very truly, yours,

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.

Honorable H. J. JEWETT, President, and

D. W. CALDWELL, Superintendent:

GENTLEMEN: I know you will rejoice with me in the completion of the transportation of the Twenty-third Army Corps so far as your road is concerned. Owing to the sudden change and severity of this midwinter weather it has only been accomplished with untiring and persevering efforts, and while some accidents and detentions have occurred, I am highly pleased to know that there has been no injury to life or limb of any person; and while I may have expressed some annoyance at these detentions, I beg to assure you that I fully appreciate the energy and efforts displayed by yourselves in making the movement a complete success. Indeed, I think no similar movement of the war, considering the distance moved, the short notice given, and the severity of the season, has been so successful, notwithstanding all the delays and accidents to which I have alluded. Under such circumstances I should be very sorry to make complaint, at least until I received your report, and had more full and definite information. The transportation of 20,000 men with all their artillery from the upper Tennessee to the Potomac, a distance of nearly 1,500 miles, over rivers and mountains in the midst of a severe winter is no ordinary occurrence, and I venture the assertion that nothing equal to it has ever occurred, either in Europe or America. Its success will be a subject for future pleasant recollection.

I remain, very truly, yours,

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.

Lieutenant Colonel J. R. BRUNER,

Commanding 130th Indiana:

COLONEL: Major-General Couch directed that an infantry escort should accompany and protect the artillery of the Twenty-third Army Corps. I have therefore to request that you will, with the 420 under your orders, take charge of the three battery trains now ready to leave for Washington City, and safely escort them in such manner as you shall deem best.

Very respectfully,

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.
