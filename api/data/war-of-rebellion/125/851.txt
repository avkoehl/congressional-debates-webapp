commend him to your notice for efficiency and creditable conduct. Throughout and during this campaign my personal attention was given to building lines up to mouth of Red River. In this work we were constantly annoyed by small parties of the enemy's cavalry, of which we captured several.

In compliance with order I made a report of the condition of the Grand Levee, and estimate of embankment necessary to repair same. The obstructions in Bayou Teche, consisting of sunken vessels filled with brick piles, iron-clads, and steam-boats, we removed with submarine batteries. Guerrillas have been numerous and annoying, but have not caused any serious delay.
