HAGERSTOWN, MD., July 27, 1864.

Major-General COUCH, Chambersburg, Pa.:

The enemy seems determined to hold Shenandoah Valley. Whether he intends to cross the Potomac again we shall be able to say to-morrow. Crook is at Sharpsburg to-night; one division of cavalry guards the river from Harper's Ferry to Downsville; the other from the latter point to Cherry Run.

Prisoners were taken who had just arrived from Richmond. Early was able to renew the fight next morning.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.
