12                                       THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                        December 4,
tions, who possess doubtful claims, and die
unscrupulous enough to commit, in order to pre-
vent their adjudication by Congiess, a deliberate
attack on the property of the United Sta es, 01 a
deliberate sequestiation of then acknowledged
dues
Foi further and moie detailed views on thiscx-
traoidwaiy case, aieferenceis made to the whole
coirespondence and opinions annexed, without
the discussion of any course, which the power
and the wisdom of Congiess are able to select
foi evincing its opinions on thisoutrage, whethci,
by withdiavvmg indulgences from the bank as to
the receipt of its notes for publicdues, or by adopt
ing some othei measure on the subject which the
natuit of the transaction, the i ghts of the United
States, and the constitution il authority of Con
giess, may be thought to justify and demand
Believing that a similar seiruie was not likely
tobciepeatedby the bank in 1835,uodei the othei
pretense of satisfying claims foi damages, in con-
sequence of the lemoval of the deposits, asset up
in its secevnd lettei, tins Department has estimated
the probabic leve nue the ( nsumg yeat fiom this
soma e, at the usual rate of dividends lately made
on all oui stock in the bank, remaining attei the
salts which have taken place for the investment
of theNny pension and hospital funds But
shot Id Congiess, on a full e\munition of the
subject, think otlu rwise, it may be provident to
supply some othei equivalent foi the poition of
tin estimated lectipts
Die tstimitc of uvenue fiom miscellaneous
souices his been computed a little below the
at tuai icceipts of the cuirent yeai, because the
dividends applicable to g< neial purposes will be
on a less amount of bank s ock, and the antici
pittd sahs of sue h stock to met t the furthei
wants of the before mentioned funds will Jae
much n duced
In this explanation of the estimate of the re

mit a laigei estimate, under th s head, than has

The estimttes foi  the expendían es of the en
suing yeai have been gnduatid and modifu d by
the following encumstance^   the actual expc id
ituies foi the veai 1833 did not differ much fion
the expectations expressed concerning them in
the last annual repoit, except that the it sulue of
the fom and a half pei cent stocks, although
chaiged to 1833, was not in fact all reimbmscd,
or the money paid to the commissioneis of loans
for that puipose, within that yea , bit only
#13,198 of them were r< deemed m the lcsidue of
1Q33 Between the 1st of Januaiy and Maj ,
1834, about $>497,G97 more was ledeemed, and
aftei waids the sum of #759,271 was advanct d to
the commissioneis of loans to meet the balance
which wa3 then outstanding Partly fiom this
cause, thcrefoic, reducing the actual expenditure
in the fouith quaiter of 1833 about a million
below the estimate, and paith fiom an niciease
in theievenuc of neailytwo millions beyond the
estima'e of that quaitei, fiom causes hi foi e i nu-
meiated,the actual available amount m the Treas

of the estimated sum of $7,983 790 The ox-
pendi'urcs in 1834, on aeeouut of the public debt,
thus became inci cased be-^ ond the estimate about
#1 25G,9G8 Another souice of expenditure, in
cieased during the past veai, beyond the esti-
mates, was the sum of #75 407 f n mteics on the
public debt, which had befoie been unclaimed,
bin which has since been demanded and dis-
charged and to meet v Inch, piobably fiom ad-
Ik un  to the usag of foimer yeais, or fiom an
impiission that it would ltmain uncalled foi, no
moni y had ben "specifically si t aside, nor any

yeai Besides these unexpected calls duung the
picsetn yeat, the appiopriations m money , by
new acts of Congress, and by foimei peitmnent
acts still in foice, h ive been computed to be about
#21,000,000 These constituted i new buiden,
in addition to a balance of p ibhe debt which
lemams to be paid, amounting to about six mil

¡ It is nticipated that with the v luablcimpi ove-
mm^soflate yeaisin steam, and the gieat advant-
ages m usmg these im movements foi haiboi and
mautime defense, some of the foi tifications ori-
ginally contemplated, may heieafter be wholly
dispensed with, or be built on a diffe ent and
leduced scale and thoi gh it is thought that only
about two millions can the fjllowi igyeai be pru-
dmtly retrenched fiom the expendituics con-
nected with foitificattons, -nd liaibors, Indians
and pensions, yet it is manifest that very soon
the amount íequned for ti ose public purposes
nust, by the completion of the most necessaiy
defenses, by the extinguishment of moot of the
titles of the Indians, and the removal of that un-
foi lunate race beyond the Mississippi, and by the
rapid maich of death among pel sioneis, and the
detectioi of numeious f auds among their pio-
fessed agents, become still more diminished, and
as our impost duties will be fuither i educed by
the ope ations of the act of Maich, 1833, the re-
duction both in levenue and m cxpendituie, for
these gieat objects, will, therefoie, happily and
conveniently foi a time be likely -veiy near to
correspond A moie fixed amount foi the oidi
naiy peace establishment of he Aimy, and some
other evpendituies connected with the executive,
legislative, and judicial dcpaitments, would, like
what now exists, with gieatei piccision and um-
foi mity 11 the expenses of the Navy, be a great
desideiatum in the peimanent adjustment of our
revenue system, and would tend,in manyimpoit
ant respects, to useful íetienchment The giad-
luil inciease íequned in some classes of expcndi-
luit , b} the gi idu d increase of oui population
and wealth, and of those public establishments
\ Inch fluctuate with them, such as some parts of
the judiciary, the legislative, and executive, could
then be acequíate ly foreseen and piovided for,
while any extraoidmary and unexjxeted enlaige-
ment in expenses would then excite inquiiy, and
unless lestmg on cleai and extiaoidmary causes,
would justify opposition When so resting, they
would be met by the public cheei fully by* mean"
of ine-eased taxes and revenue
Anothei important circumstance deserves
consideiation m explanation of the new and con-
tingent item of #2,500,000, now first added to
the estimates for tne ensuing year It has been
ascertained by acareful sciutmy and compauson,
that much of the gieat expenditures of the last
fou yeais, besides the payment of the debt, ha've
austm from appropnationsby Congiess to alai gei
amount undei particular heads, than the geneial
estima es foi the yeai,submitted by the Tieastuy,
and to large appropi rations to objects not specifi-
cally included in any estimates To illustrate
this, an abstiactof a table of the geneial estimates,
appiopuations, andexpendituies,dunng the past
two yeais, and of all these, but the expendituies
dm mg the past tin ee years, has been pi epaied ai d

| es'imates and apjiropr ations, indejaendent of the
' public debt, m lh32, of letween five and six mil-
lions in 1833, ofneaily five millions, and in 1834,
of about thiee millions The Ingest poition of
this gieat inciease, amounting 11 the first two
years, nom o ic quntei to one thud of the whole
appiopmtions, it will be seen is under the civil
and miscellaneous heads, and under nemsclassed
with the militaiv establishment, such as hirbois
imptoved, pensions, &c Toi theinfoimation of
the public on a comjniison deemed so -very im
portant,it is pioposod to publish the detaih d table
fiom which this ip compiled, and asimilar one
heieafter, appended to the annual exhibit of the
receipts and expenditures Should this practice
of makm appropuations so gieatly exceeding the
est mates be continued by Congiess, it will not
oi Iy piev-ent much icduction, particulaily undti
the miscellaneous head, but it will be necessaiy
to provide fo' the consequences of it by an
augmented levenue, piopoitionate to these de-
mands, oi by a largei legulu surplus in the
Treasiuyto meet such unexpected met eases of
appiopuations it must be m^mfe st, that it is
not m the pow er of this Department to foresee
and complete thesp men ase s with any fh gree of
aecuiacy, as with the exception of some subse-
quent en mates, submitted aftei the annual ones,
th"y depend almost vvholl} m then inception,
on the pleasure and discretion of Congiess and as
they consist chiefly of miscellaneous public ob
jects, and prívale gi mts for almost numberless
causes, they may vaiy greatly m d.fferent years.
Butit might be unfaithfulness in the undt rsigned,
t iwards both Congress and the public, since the
extent of the influence of this excess on the ex
penditures, though alvvajs somcthn g, has been
ascertained to be very laige during the last three
years, not to bring it distinctly to their notiee>, and
not to submit a contingent item m the estimates
for the puipose of covering it Whether that
which the Department has now offered, reduced
as it is neaily one half fiom the average of the
actual txcosteE during the thiec fu.st yeais, \>ill
