Commanding Third Division, Fourth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The commanding general directs me to say that no movement of the troops will be made for the present; that all men belonging to the several commands who are at the rear and fit for the field will be sent forward immediately, and that the knapsacks and field baggage for officers may also come forward. Proper officers to take charge of the property will be sent to Knoxville, the details being as small as possible and approved at these headquarters.

NEW MARKET, March 6, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

If a movement be made of the Ninth and Fourth Corps, which will necessitate one of the Twenty-third also, they will need about thirty wagons to haul the accumulated stores and ammunition. In the skirmish yesterday the rebels lost 9 miles, including a major; we lost 3 killed, 1 badly wounded, and nearly 20 prisoners. We have 2 rebel prisoners.

No further news from the front.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.

NEW MARKET, March 6, 1864.

Captain J. N. KING,

Commissary of Subsistence, Strawberry Plains:

Do not allow stores to come forward so as to accumulate beyond the capacity of the regimental trains to move them. We do not want depots at the camps which could not be carried away in any movement to front or rear on a moment's notice. Please say the same to Captain Van Ness.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Acting Chief of Staff in the Field.

NEW MARKET, March 6, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Knoxville:

The Twenty-third Corps was, I believe, the only one ordered to send back the officers' horses. I called for the statement of the number before getting your dispatch, and will have it in the morning. Have also given the orders to have no large accumulation of stores at the camps.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Acting Chief of Staff.
