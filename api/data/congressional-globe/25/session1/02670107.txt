Making public officers depoiilories—Mr. Brown.
Senate.
present in power? We need only refer to the cir-
jnitJal conduct of a certain class of individuals,
who had threatened resistance to the Government
jiot long since, because the postages were demand-
ed of them m the legal currency oí the United
States, when th y well knew it would be an open
violation of law ¡or officers of the Government to
receive any ot'iei.
The measure proposed was no innovation on the
principles of our Government, but was, m fact, a
revival of those practised on in the early da>s oí
the AepubliCjiindei the very extensive powers given
thifc Secretary ot the Treasury, by the law first or-
ganizing that depaitment When but tew banks
(existed at that time, individuals engaged m the col-
lection of the revenue, in many instances, weie re-
quired to keep and disbui^e the public moneys,
when called on by that omcei To him, the
system of collecting, keeping, and disbursing
the public moneys of the Federal Government,
through its own officers, was ÜV most obvi-
ous and simple that could be devised Nothing
appeared more natural and appropriate, than
that a Government should execute its own
laws, through officers appointed by itself, and ac-
countable to its authority When the Constitution
was framed, there wete but few banks in the United
States Its framers, therefoie, must have intended
that lis finances should be managed by its own offi-
cers; ol'nei wise thej would have given the power, in
that instrument, to Congress, to cieate a bank cor-
poration for that purpose Asthesvstem now pi o-
posed, therefore, was that evidently intended by the
iramers ot the Constitution, gentlemen paid them
¡but a poor compliment wh"n ihej denounced it as
fraught with so much danger to the liberties of the
people Of nothing was he more entueU con
vmced, than that its tendency was to lessen greatlv
Executive patiouage, instead of to inciease it, as hid
Ticen so oonhdtntl} jus ted on by those v ho wcie
opposed to it. It proposed no addition to the num-
ber of public officers already existing It involved
an expense of only compaiatively trifling amount.
Where then was the incieased patronage so much
complained of That it would greatly diminish
the patronage of the Executive branch of the Go-
vernment to discontinue the employment of the
State banks as its fiscal agents, the speeches of gen-
tlemen in opposition could be cited abundantly to
prove.
When the law was, at a former session, undei
consideration, by uhich they weie made the depo-
sitories of the public íevenue, it was then repre-
sented by them as placing the State banks u' der
the control of the Executive, and organizing a mo-
neyed power to be wielded át his will for the de-
struction of the liberties of the country Politically
hostile to the administration, as he believed much
the larger pot tion of those who managed them were,
an reality, tney brought no strength to the party in
power but were rather the souice of weakness
But to an administration of congenial politics with
themselves, they could bring a power and influence,
dangerous to the liberties of the country By
ceasing to employ them, the Government in ef-
fect re «oved the meins of its influence from a vast
number of persons wl-o were engaged m managing
those institutions, ana, so fir is their fiscal agency
was concerned, were to be regaided as its officers
It was then almost susceptible of positive demon-
stration , that the proposed measure, by greatly re-
ducing the number of those engaged in conducting
the fiscal affaas of tne Government, to that extent
diminished the patronage of the Government
The President, in « commending a severance of
the connection between the Government and the
banks, had assumed an attitude of dignified firm-
ness and moral elevation, worthy the character of
the Chief Magistrate of the nation It carried out
the doctrine into practice, that simplicity in the ad-
ministration of a Government founded on the
will of the people, while it is the readiest means
of perpetuating its principles, is the surest way of
securing their esteem, and approbation It volun-
tary proposed to relinquish whatever of power
and influence might be derived to the Executive
branch of the Government from a connect.on with
moneyed institutions, and m doing so, would leave
it to repose ( n the wisdom  of ns policy, and tin.
menu of its measuies, foi public support
The objection, said Mr B that to carry into ef-
fect the measuie pioposed, would be an attack on
the banking institutions of the country, and, through
them, on the people, was to his mind equally un-
founded
Unless it could be proved that the banks were the
people, it would, he thought, be difficult to establish
this assumpuon He knew that the paper system
was íapidiy gaming a powerful ascendancy over
public opinion, but it had not vet so entuel/ usurped
their privileges and prerogatives, as to make them
and the banks convertible terms What light, he
would ask, had the banks to the custody and enjuy-
mi nt of the public m enue1 Was it at all necessaiy
to the maintenance of then proper credit, that thev
should be employed to manage it? The first inquiry
was answered by the conduct of the banks, m with-
holding liom the Government its means, and thus
crippling its operations To the second, it may
very propeily ce answeied that they, like indivi-
duals, should be left to then own intrinsic mei tts
and means to sustain their ciedit If they conduct
their business on prudent and sound principles of
banking, and act with honesty and fairness in then
transactions, their ciedit will be, as a matter of
couise, established To that extent tney aie entitled
to credit, and no more. Any other ciedit bevond
that is fictitious, and productive of injurious conse-
quences
Many of the banks who had  been  in  posses-
sion oí the Government deposites, had no doubt
been injured b) the  excesses to which  ihey  had
been stimulated m consequence i fit, evce^es pi o- |
\mg alike injunoLS to themsthe^, and these who |
had boiroued of them       Its  tendency   wis to ex- ,
pand the paper'>stem K>oil its pioper bomds,
bv   iidblmg tli„ barks to discount  laigeh on 'und
not'h irown  a   tv bene ill ukr, as ihe\ musto'
necessity be by l oveinment at snort mteivals, the
frequent consequence would be a pressure on the
community by the banks  who loaned them, that
they might be enabled to meet the Government de-
mand.    The effect then of using the banks as de-
positories, in this point of view, is to produce fluc-
tuations in the bank note currency of the country,
and to produce  those  shocks m trade and busi-
ness, so detrimental to both
An objection not less specious and unfounded,
than that which he had  just noticed, and which
had been used as in argument ogamst the pobo)
of ihe bill, was that it attacked, what, m his judg-
ment, was erroneously calle 1 the  credit system
Towards the  true credit sjstem of the country,
none felt more attachment  and   lespecf, and   a
more anxious desire topieserve it, than himself
But, if it was meant that the effect of the meamie
would be to put an end to that supendous system
of legalized fraud and plunder, which, under every
variety of the paper system, had foi   some   time
preyed on the   industry   and   piospenty   of the
country, he, foi one, would rejoice at such a íesult
He most sncerily  wished to see that system of
ciedit, which  was the offspring of merit, probity,
or wealth, protecied to the fullest extent, but not
that system which prompts Us  follow ers to seek
their ends through all the avenues of gambling and
fraudulent speculation     It was ,. sjstem, by which
the  moie   honest, but less wa y, class of society
were made victems of the schemes and arts of the
more practiced and designing
Among the strong recommendations (continue 1
Mr B ) in favor of placing the public moneys in
the hands oi individual depositories, is the perfect
and entire po ler which it affords to the Govern-
ment at all times, through its agents, to look into
the state of its funds by actual inspection The
bill provides thst the Secretary of the Tieasury
shall cause examinations of the moneys on hand
and accounts of each depository to be made at
least once a yeai, and as much oftener as he may
deem necessaiy, and, foi this puipose, authorizes
him to appoint special agents In this way, the
Government will alwajs be enabled to know the
actual condition of its finances This power can
not be exercised over the State banks, because they
are corporations existing independently of the will
of Congress, and, therefoie, subject to no mode of
investigation bj the Secretary of the Treasury other
than that afforded bv their returns. Nor would
the case, in this point of view, be improved if a
national bank exited, and was made the depo«-
tory of the public revenues The resistance «Vade
by the officers of the late bank to a^committee" ap-
poin'ed by the House of Representatives to exa-
mine its condition, shows the power and will of
moneyed corporations to evade investigation, even
by those from whom they hold their charters.    *
As to ihe co nparalive safety of the two plans,
m taking care of the public revenue, as a whole it
was m f ivor of the system to be conducted by in-
dividuals Some of them might, occasionally, be-
come defaulter, as, in the management of human
afidirs, under the wisest system, it was impossible
to avoid casualt es and difficulties But, under no *
crcumstances, could it be exoected a state of things
would occur vhich would deprive the Government
of the u>e of%ts enhte means, as had lately been ihe
case, by the banks having resorted to a suspension
of specie payments In that aspect of the case,
then, the question of suptnor safety was against
th-banks as depositories of the revenue, and in
favor ot the plan proposed
The proportion of the gentleman from South
Caí olma (Mr Calhoun) so to amend the bill as to
make the public dues, of every description, after a
certain period, payable only in gold or silvei com,
or in such note--, bills, or paper, issued under the au-
thority of the United Stales, as may be directed
to be recened by law, met his hearty concurrence.
The able arguments by which it had aheadv been
enforced uou'd occasion him to confine his re-
marks to a few of the principal benefits which
v. ould i suit to the country from its adoption
It would, m the first place, free the Federal
Government fiom all the casualt es difficulties,
?n I en birrassmen's with \tnieh it-, financial
action hid b"cu so lepeite'lj opposed by the
receipt oi bails paper It was not only im-
portant, m the operations of Government, that it
should be able promptly to command its money,
but that it should be of a kind universally current,
as well m the country as out of it Money was the
great agent which ga\ e to Government its action
and efficiency In proportion as it was good, was
the energy and success of its operations in periods
of emergency In proportion as it was debased,
was its action weakened, and its success jeopardized.
Much of the success of a Got eminent depended
oa us pract sing the principles of justice n its
traniac ions with its citizens, by which it inspued
sentiments of respect, and strengthened it in their
affections Disbursing, as it d d, annually large
sums of money m the public expenditures, made
thioughout the country, it could not fail io lessen
those sentiments of respect and a'tachment by
making its payments in a currency of less value
than that recognised by its Constitution, because,
in doing so, it would violate the principles of jus-
tice which itself had established
Again its tenlency would he, if aided by the
passage of another bill then on the table, proposing
to abolish e> edits in the jiajment of all the public
daes, and substitute cash payments m their s ead,
to check that spirit of over-trading and excessive
importation which had prevailed to such an extent
among oiu merchants engaged m fore'gn trade
From it, evils of the greatest magnitude had arisen
to ti e currency of the countrj, as well as to oar
trade and on me ice at home and abroad. The
great facilities afforded by the banks m obtaining
loans would powerfully stimulate our merchants to
over-trade, so long as bank notes were made receiv-
able by our law s in pa} ment of the customs. The
effect of this measuie, then, would be to reduce the
imports liom aoroad nearer to the standard ot our
exports, and remove the evil effects on the business
andcurrenc\ ot the country, always the consequence
of over-trading In doing this, the receipts of the
Government would be lessened and brough down
to a pom* making it incumbent on it to practice
economy in its expenditures
Another effect, of not less public utility, which
would result from it, in his opinion, as auxiliary to
the benefit of placing the publ c monej in the
hands of individual depositories, was the suppres-
sion, to a great extent, of that system of fraud and
