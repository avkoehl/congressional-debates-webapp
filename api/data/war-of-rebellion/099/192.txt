H. W. HALLECK,

BENWOOD, January 31, 1865.

(Received 5. 10 p.m.)

Honorable c. A. DANA,

Assistant Secretary of War:

The last car is loaded and on the way over the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. I am just leaving for Washington. There is not a word of truth in any report relative to the freezing of soldiers in Ohio, as far as the Twenty-third Army Corps in concerned. If at all it only applies to some 2,000 or 3,000 arriving some days after from Nashville and going to New York via Pittsburg.

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel, in Charge.
