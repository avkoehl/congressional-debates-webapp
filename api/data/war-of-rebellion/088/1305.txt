COLONEL: Your communication of this date, inquiring if I can extend to the right so as to relieve Cooke's brigade, has been received. In reply, I have simply to state that I will relieve Cooke's brigade, and have given the necessary orders to accomplish that object.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN M. OTEY, Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: My assistant adjutant-general, Captain Foote, has perhaps informed you that the authority to stop the movement for relieving Cooke's brigade could not be communicated before we had covered his position. If this brigade is not withdrawn form the city to-night I would suggest that it should be placed in vicinity of Blandford cemetery as a reserve force, or a regiment of it might be placed at each of the salients on my line - Colquitt's, Elliott's, Gracie's - and the left of my line in reserve.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.

Procure negro labor and finish works and redoubts at Weldon as soon as possible. Strengthen them thoroughly with abatis.
