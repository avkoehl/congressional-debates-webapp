HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,Fort Monroe, February 9, 1864.

Major- General PECK,

Commanding District of North Carolina:

GENERAL: I send you a copy of the Richmond Examiner with Pickett's report of his attack upon New Berne, and also the Petersburg account of why he did not succeed. I wish to call your attention to the statement that one of our negro soldiers was hanged. If there is any foundation for it send out a flag of truce and ask General Pickett if it is true; if so, report to me.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

The army gun- boats Brewster and Foster have also been ordered to report to General Wessells, the former via Hatteras, the latter by way of the canal.

HEADQUARTERS OUTPOSTS,Batchelder's Creek, N. C., February 9, 1864- 10. 30 a. m.

Captain JUDSON,

Assistant Adjutant- General:

I am somewhat disappointed in not getting those five companies by this a. m. train. Please do not wait till regular p. m. train, but send them right up, with one day's rations in haversack, overcoats on, and blanket slung, but no knapsacks, and each having 40 rounds ammunition. I will post them from here, and it must be done while it is daylight. T	heir traps can come up to- morrow. My men have had for the last ten days more than I ask these should do for one day. The enemy is still in force at Kinston. I will most likely know by night what their future designs are; I think they are going to Raleigh, Weldon, and South Carolina

P. J. CLAASSEN,

Colonel, Commanding Outposts.

Lieutenant HALSTED:

Make a careful observation and report whether the enemy have withdrawn any of their camps along the Rapidan.
