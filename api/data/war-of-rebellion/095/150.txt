HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Crossing of Hatcher's Run by Vaughan Road,

February 5, 1865-8 p. m. (Sent 8.22 p. m.)

I have withdrawn Warren and the cavalry to this point directing two divisions to remain on the other side of the run, one to cross to this side as a reserve for contingencies. Humphreys' is instructed to await developments, and to attack, if advantageous, and drive the enemy into their works. The enemy have a strong line of works passing through the Clements house; this house is the place where the shot fell near us no last movement-that is to say; since then the enemy have advanced their line. Unless we can carry this line, we can hardly reach the Boydton plank road or South Side Railroad without this they attacked Humphreys' right.

Orders have been sent to Gregg to proceed to Belfield, provided he finds on reaching Dinwiddie Court-House andy confirmation of the contraband's report, or obtains any reliable intelligence leading him to believe he can effect anything there. The depot is, however, undoubtedly at Hickford, across the Meherrin, and is guarded by artillery, as it was when Warren was there. We also believe that W. H. Lee's division of cavalry is in that vicinity. Gregg goes without artillery.

I send a dispatch from General Gregg, received on my arrival just now. A staff officer who carried my last dispatch to General Warren reports that, on leaving, three squadrons of Greff's cavalry came in to Warren, saying the enemy's cavalry had attacked Gregg's rear guard and cut them off. I am a little apprehensive of the enemy's cavalry interposing between Gregg and Warren, and preventing the latter using the road he advanced on to withdraw his artillery and trains. I have however, sent orders to Gregg to open this road, if possible, and escort back Warren's trains.
