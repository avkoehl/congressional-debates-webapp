41st Cong....3d Sess.
The Freedmen's Bureau—Mr. McNeely.
Ho. of Reps.
the bureau at the rate of ten dollars for each
thirty scholars taught therein. For example,
Mr. Alvord states in his report to General
Howard that " the Ely school, (at Louisville,
Kentucky,) in care of the American Mission-
ary Association, has seven teachers and three
hundred pupils in the commodious house re-
cently buih by the bureau." According to
Dr. Whipple's testimony, the bureau pays to
that association for this house ten dollars per
month as rent. He says that the bureau pays
at this rate even when the house was wholly
built out of bureau funds. In this way this
Government is this moment paying rent for
hundieds of school houses which were built
out of Government funds.
Thus this association is in all respects an
adjunct to the bureau, deriving its main mon-
eyed support from that source, which it uses
m exercising power over the ignorant colored
man.
This association has the right to teach what-
ever doctrine it chooses, but General Howard
had no right to support it or any other religious j
association in promulgating their religious
opinions with Government funds. I shall not
discuss the merits or usefulness of this
ciation, but I believe that the great body of
those people who sympathize with or are mem-
bers of it will condemn its officers for their
transactions with the bureau, and for having
accepted and used Government funds in the
manner revealed by the testimony.
Mr. Speaker, another active agency in this
great conspiracy against the people of the
united States, prosecuted through this bureau,
are the freedmen's savings-banks. These insti-
tutions are of the same character and governed
by the same men. These are but a part of the
machinery by which the poor negroes are plun-
dered and made subservient to the political
and selfish designs of those who, clothed with
authority, are sent down among them for that
purpose, under the pretext of affording protec-
tion and sympathy.
The extent of the power of these banks
cannot be overstated. The money already
obtained from the colored people, and retained
and used by those who received it, now amounts
to several million dollars. The following offi
cial statement of the parent bank at Washing-
ton, for March, 1870, will show these in detail:

of March, 1870.

An inspection of the evidence will show tliat
this bank has either become a part 01 the
bureau or the bureau has become a part of this
bank. The rent ot the branches in Honda
and other States was paid out of
funds by order of General Howard. Hail the
expenses of the branch in New \ork city were
paid by the bureau. The furniture for the
bank in this city was paid for in part by
the bureau. During the last year $3,510 oO
of the expenses of these banks was paid by
the bureau out of Government funds. General
Howard was the first vice president of the
parent bank, and Alvord, the general super-
intendent of education of the bureau, was its
president. Among its trustees will be seen the
names of Charles Howard, assistant coinmis-
sioner Freedmen's Bureau ; General Balloch,
disbursing officer Freedmen's Bureau; Henry
D" Cooke, treasurer Young Men's Christian
Association; John A. Cole, financial agent
Howard University; John R. bivans, trustee
Barry farm fund ; Edgar Ivetcham, treasurer
American Missionary Association; Geoi-e
Whipple, secretary American Missionary Asso-
ciation j and General ;B. Whittlesey, inspector
schools Freedmeu's 'Bureau, it held ou de-
posit the Barry farm fund, Howard limver-
sity funds, dealt in Congregationalist church
bonds, Young Men's Christian Association
bonds, and was the appointed agent of this
bureau to payout colored soldiers' bounties in
the southern States. It was a part of the busi-
ness of bureau agenls to solicit deposits in these
banks. Alvord, the president of this bank
and general superintendent of education in
the bureau, in his reports to General Howard,
written during his tour through the South last
January and February, and already referred
to, makes frequent mention of the American
Missionary Association, ihe Republican party,
the schools, and these banks; but it is impos-
sible to tell which he considers the most import-
ant, except in his report from Chattanooga, in
which he contends that "the banks are doing
more for the people than the schools."
I consider it one of the highest duties of
Congress to protect the interests of the Gov-
ernment as well as the equal rights of the
people. No subject can be of more pervad-
ing public concern than that which reaches
the social, religious, and political prejudices
of classes. The Freedmen's Bureau has been
made a mighty engine of power, by which to
control an entire section of the Union and bring
it under partisan subserviency. To accomplish
this the public Treasury has been freely used
in various ways. Bmissaries have been dis-
patched to the South with the Bible in one
hand and the purse in the other, and who have
been backed up and sustained by both the mili-
tary and civil power of the Government. Thus,
successful applications were made to the neces-
sities and ignorance of a people who had not
learned the arts of the demagogue nor the wiles
of politicians. Under the pretense of giving
him protection, the negro was plundered of
his just dues; under the pretense of teaching
him religion and morality, he was taught a
hatred of his best friends; under an avowed
object of teaching him his political rights and
duties, he was drilled into a voting machine
and made tributary to the aspirations of those
who said they came to enlighten him; under
the plea of shielding him from oppresson, hard
labor was wrung from him, and his little earn-
ings once obtained as deposits in freedmen's
savings-banks, were used for the profitof those
who had the control of them.
This bureau bad its ramifications every-
where ; its officers and agents were to be found
in every State, county, and voting precinct, of
, the South : no election could be held but that
I some of them were found on the spot exer-
' cising political power over the new-made citi-
zen, and the leading candidates for the princi-
pal offices were the self-nominated representa-
tives of the Freedmen's Bureau. A majority
of the members of the Legislatures ot the
so-called reconstructed States last year were
either taken from this class or the imme-
diate dependents of it; the civil government,
what there was of it, was in their hands. Ihe
bureau was the great absorbent of the only
civil authority there. Whenever this power
was disturbed an appeal was made to Congress
and a new reconstruction ordered.
To ascertain the whole amount of public
money devoted to these purposes and distrib-
uted through the bureau would be impossible;
no public record will now tell it. Ihe offi-
cial report of General Howard to Congress m
December last places it at about thirteen mil-
lion dollars. This is very far short of the
actual sum disbursed through tbe bureau.
The counsel for General Howard in his argn-
ment before the committee, in his final suiu-
min<  up of the case, in the presence of Geu-
eraftloward, stated, with his consent and ap-
proval, that this amount exceeded this sum, and
'•ranged from §13,000,000 to $20,000,000."
it is safe to conclude that the latter more
nearly approaches the true amount. A larjie
