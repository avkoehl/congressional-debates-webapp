our most constant and most steady friend for years
past' He rather thought Government were to be
censured for not having a minister there at ail times,
and the honorable member was the last person from
whom he expected to heai such a declaration He
was authorized, in answer to the ideas thrown out
that there was no appointment to be made this ses
sion, to state explicitly, that it was the intention of
the Presiden* to nominate to these courts, during
the piesent session, unless, in the mean time, cir-
cumstances should occur, which, in his judgment,
E'nould render it unnecessary
Mr WAYNE maintained that the present prac-
tice was not different from that which had been
whilst the gentleman from Massachusetts was
connected with the Government If it was at all
different, then he would admit he had some reason
for his complaints But the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts ought to have known the salaries were
paid in proportion to the time the peisona are em-
ployed abroad and returning back to this country
Although it had occuned that a large sum was
paid for the Russian mission, in the case of Mi
Randolph, yet as that arose from his indisposition
or misfortune, whu h could not be averted, it might
occur to any Administration They were not,
therefore, censurable He referred to the various
nominations made to England, and the circum
stances connected with the recall of Mr Van Buren
by the Senate, as having added to the expenditure,
but not reflecting on the Executive, or warranting
this to be made to him a matter of insinuation or
reproach
Mr POLK buefly remaiked that the appropria-
tions now made weie of the usual character, and
upon estimates prepared by the department, which
was the usual way in which the Executive inten-
tion of making these appointments was known to
Congress
Mr DAVIS rejoined, and said that as far as his
vote was concerned, he would support the rights
vested in him as a íepresentative, by withholding
the appropriations'o all nominations not filled up,
as he contended, according to the Constitution, and
thus say to the President, you shall comply with
its provisions
Mr AD IMS rose to make some explanation,
but gave way to
Mi MERCER, who said, as this amendment
was not to be disposed of lightly, and it was then
close upon six o'clock, he would move that the
committee rise
The motion prevailed
Thereupon, the committee rose
The bills laid aside early in the day, weie
reported to the House, with the progiess in the
appropriation bill, aftei which,
1 ne House adjourned

Mr McKEAN piesented the proceedings of a
Jackson and Woh meeting of a laige number of
the inhabitants of Noithampton county,Pennsyl-
vania, approving of the course of the Executive in
removing the deposites from the Bank of the Uni-
ted States, and opposed to the rechartei of said
bank
The proceedings were read, referred to the Com-
mittee on Finance, and ordered to be printed
Mi CLAY piesented a memorial signed bycit
ízensot Bald Eagletownslnp.Centiecounty, Penn-
sylvania, in iavoi of the restoration of the depos-
ites to the Bank of the United States, which was
read, ¡eferred to the Committee on Finance, and
oidered to be printed
Mi CHAMBERS presented the proceedings of
a meeting of citizens of Baltimore, in opposition to
some of the doctrines of the protest of the Presi
dent of the United States to the resolutions of the
Senate with regard to the íemoval of the depos
ltes
Mr CHAMBERS rose and said, he was re-
quested by the officers of a laige public meeting,
just held by the Whigs of Baltimore, to present its
proceedings to the Senate The meeting was held
in consequence of the invitation of the President in
his appeal to the people They had naatuiely con
sidered it, and passed sentence upon the various
questions which were the subject matter of it, and
now here it was in the shape of a special verdict,
in which the people of Baltimore have set forth
their opinions The gentleman from Tennessee
[Mr GituND-f] might suppose that this allusion to
Whig principles implied the opposite of it in his
party, and that this coverlet or blanket was not
broad enough to include us all, but, at all events,
they weie so well satisfied with this covering, that
they did not mean to be disrobed of it Mr C
then commented at laige on the Piesident's pro-
test, cordemningthedoctnnes contained in it He
alluded to the Panama mission, and the opinions
eommunieatenHo the Senate by Mr Adams, when
President, of his power to send a minister therein
the recess, and that gentlemen who nowsustained
the Administration condemned those opinions
Mi  C concluded by moving that the proceed
mgs be read, and take the usual refeience .
Mr GRUNDY said he had caiefully abstained
from sayinganythmgin thediscussionsupon these
memorials     His constituents had sent none here,
and he was inclined to leave them to the expression
of their own sentimentsin their own timeand way
He was now called up foi sentiments delivered on
anerther occasion, and he regretted tofind his opin
ions questioned on the piesentation of a bank me-
morial     Between himself and the gentleman ñora
Maryland   [Mr    Chambers]   the  same feeling
existed as among all other citizens     We were all
patriots and Whigs—and all admitted it   Butthis
new name the gentleman was pi easing as if it was
of some service to him,  and he refened to the
Panama mission, and eays that the opponents of
executive usurpation are Whigs      But was the
gemreman fiom Maiyland a Whig then—was he
of the paity then for which  he now claims this
name'  Mr G ventuied to say that the gentleman
then voted for this very power, which was then
claimed by the Executive, and about to be exer-
cised     Well, if those who suppoitit now are not
as good as their opponents, he could say that the
gentleman  had impioved in his whigism    And
whether this was owing to a change m his con
dition, was mattei for his own consideration    But
a word   m legard  to the  difference   of position
which they now occupied   What had Mr Adams
done at that time'   Nothing but to give his opin
ion thathe had a right to send such a mission, and
therefore he submitted the subject to Congress
The Senate then took it up, as it was theirduty to
do, and pionounced their opinion     But was Mi
Adams chaigeu with a violation of the Constitu
tion and laws of thecountiy > No, the Senate onl>
differed with him in opinion in regard to the power
which he intimated he possessed    Now, the Presi-
dent was dnectly charged with a violation of the
Constitution  and  laws      Here was  something
clear, positive,palpable,and tangible   In the other
instance theie was nothing but an erroi in judg
ment imputed
Mi G had no objection whatever that thegen
tleman from Maiyland should call his friends
Whigs All he (Mr G ) contended against was
the assumption that they wei e the exclusiveWhigs,
for they were not deserving of the title If the
name was significant of the old tenets upon politics,
Mi G hoped that the Whigs would include nine
ty nine hundiedths of the people Whigs they
were, but there was no class exclusively so Mr
G admitted that arrong the friends of theAdmm-
istiation there were a great variety of opinions on
vauous subjects, but that fact only showed that
they did not yield their opinions to the opinions or
will of one man We (the fi lends of the Admm
istration) stood, in our humble judgment, on the
principles which were upheld m '99, and which
weie carried down to the present day And be-
tween the gentleman from Maryland and himself,
Mr G said there was not so much difference after
all Here was a coverunder which wecould both
get, and, therefore,in regard to their whigism there
was not so much difference as the gentleman
thought Mr G believed they were Whigs, and
wewere Whigs, buthehoped thegentleman would
not throw the correlative of the term on him, for
he thought he did not deserve it, and if thegentle-
¡ man would be willing to let us all go on as Whigs
no inconvenience would result from it But when
he excludes us, who are as true Whigs as any,
then we feel an insurrectionary spnit, and we are
not quite satisfied with the treatment These citi-
zens of Baltimoie, then, have taken the name ot
Whigs, and there are none more deserving of it
But when they get a new name—and they make a
great boast of it—it seemed like claiming what they
never had before Now, they were Whigs long
before this new assumption of the name They
were Whigs m theilevolution,and also in thelast
war, and the citizens of Baltimore weie not doing
themselves justice to claim just now what they
had borne for the last half century, and it wasnot
right for their friends to put this garment on them
as if it were new, when it is an old one, and long
worn by them, and is none the worse for wear
He theiefore objected to the friends of the Whigs
of Baltimoie putting this mantle on as for theiirst
time, for they had it before It was nonewinven-
tion, ornewthmg
But, sir,wego undei a name, and a good old one,
too, which distinguished us from all others In
the struggle between the elder Adams and Mr
Jefferson, the friends of Mr Jeffeieon were called
demociats, and the friends of Mr Adams ansto
crats, by way of dension, and the name of repub-
lican was assumed This was significant as to the
powers of the General Goverrment and its differ
ent branches Now, this term Whig will not do
as a designation of parly .because it includes a ma-
jority of all parties Gentlemen have found out
1 that the teim National Republican will not answer
, then puipose, because it cannot be spread broad
I enough to embrace a majority The Whigs woutd
I cover eveiybody and theiefbie Mr G wanted
¡ the gentleman to find some«iiarae that would do
I National Republican would not cover the South,
it would not cnss the Potomac You might build
your eontemolated fine budge across that river,
'' and still it would not cross it for the South, not
even so far as Virginia oi North Carolina, and as
to South Carolina, it could not get within sight of
it South Carolina was fond of a name which she
would not swap for it, because these MUhfiers of
the South wanted to establish then own principles
Well, the 'ime was when they could not get out of
the limits of South, Caiolma with them, and they
weie quite pent up there But they seem to have
expanded since Mr G said he had not read,
but he had heard much talk of the nullifying gen-
tlemen lately visiting north of this place and they
weie taken to the bosom by men who, twelve
months ago, wereieady to denounce them as trai-
tors In Philadelphia, too, these gentlemen were
received notonly with impunity, but with applause
This only showed how changeable we are,and he
could not say how it might all be six months hence,
i for if fifteen thousand men in Baltimore twelve
months ago consideied that almost treason which
they were now hugging to their bosoms as patriot-
ism, we did not know what it might he twelve
months hence They had given us their opinions
to day, and by that time they might chan e them,
and therefore he could not calculate where they
might be found hereafter Now, he took no ex-
ception whatcvei to all this, and yesterday, or the
day piecedmg, when the gentleman from Ken-
tucky [Mr Clai] was lecturing Governor Wolf
about changing his opinions, it was saying nothing
moie than what was applicable to the gentleman
himself Governor Wolf was formerly in favor
of the bank, and now he was against it, no doubt
from the most honest convictions, the Senator
himself had changed his own opinion on the same
subject, theiefore no censure could attach to gen-
tlemen for entertaining one opinion to day,and,on
further consideration, changing it, and acting on
it So, some of the citizens of Baltimore were
once  friends of the Pissident,  they had  now
