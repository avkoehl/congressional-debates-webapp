Honorable ROBERT OULD, Agent for Exchange of Prisoners:

SIR: A. D. Richardson and Junius H. Browne, correspondents of the New York Tribune, captured about the 4th of May last, near Vicksburg, are said to be confined in the Libby Prison. Mr. Colburn, the correspondent of the New York World, who was captured with them, has been released. It has been the practice to treat attaches of the press as non-combatants and not to retain them. The release of Mr. Colburn is a partial recognition of this practice. Will you please inform me if you will release Richardson and Browne; and if not, why not?

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.

Honorable ROBERT OULD, Agent for Exchange of Prisoners:

SIR: Please have ready for delivery all our officers in your hands who have been declared exchanged, Spencer Kellogg among the number. Deliveries of your officers declared exchanged can then be effected. I would suggest to you that Doctor Rucker be included. I very much desire that all surgeons should be treated as non-combatants and unconditionally released. As I have before remarked to you, the cause of humanity demands it. I saw Doctor Green at Fort Norfolk. He is most anxious to know what is to be his fate. Can you inform him?

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WN. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.
