MERIDAN, MISS.,

January 5, 1864.

General JOHNSTON,

Dalton, Ga.:

The rest of your staff all left last night. I included in my list only a part of the West Tennessee regiments.

From the information I have from above they all should come. They will all make only two light brigades. Their generals are Vaughan and Strahl. Cheathan should by all means accompany them. I will return you Forney or M. L. Smith, or Mackall, with my recommendation of the latter for major-general.

Forrest is out of Tennessee with 4,000 men; others coming.

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
