Major General JOHN A. LOGAN,

Commanding Fifteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Move General Harrow's division up to the front of your line, one brigade in the line on the left of General Osterhaus and two in reserve. Occupy the hill in advance of General Osterhaus' left as an advanced post. Make use of all the intrenching tools you have to strengthen the left, which appears to be the weakest part of our line.

Yours, truly,
