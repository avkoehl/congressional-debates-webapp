in condition to meet any sudden advance of the enemy; that most of the men were without their accouterments. At least half of the men of the different regiments should be on duty all the time and ready to receive an attack, and pickets and vedettes should be posted sufficiently far out to warn the whole command. The regimental commanders do not fully realize the importance of their trust, and they should be instructed. I think it would be well that your inspector and those of the brigades should visit the lines frequently and see that these suggestions are carried out. This is not written with any desire to find fault, but suggested as a matter of instruction and precaution.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,August 23, 1864-8.30 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

General Miles' division is moving to Reams' Station with one regiment of cavalry. Is it required that more cavalry shall operate with him, or shall the cavalry be kept concentrated on the left of the Second Corps in the interval between it and General Miles' division? I have one brigade a mile north of Reams' Station, where the road to Dinwiddie Court-House strikes off. A portion of the cavalry is out of forage and it is impracticable to supply it here.

(Through Headquarters Fifth Corps.)

Your dispatch of 8.30 a.m. is received.s The change of circumstances since the order of yesterday renders it desirable that a brigade of cavalry shall accompany the division destroying the railroad. You will please give directions accordingly. The remainder of your cavalry in that quarter should be concentrated on the left, covering that flank, and held ready to operate as circumstances may require. The animals of your supply train must be used to bring up forage.
