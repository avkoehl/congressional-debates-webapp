HEADQUARTERS SIGNAL DEPARTMENT.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: A camp heretofore visible southwest of Cemetery Hill and about half a mile distant from said hill has disappeared. A new camp was pitched about noon to-day near the Richmond pike and about one mile and a half from Pocahontas; it would be about large enough for two regiments. While upon the station near the Gibbon house I saw the glistening of muskets through the foliage along the Richmond pike. The troops carrying the arms were moving toward Petersburg. The strength column I cannot approximate, as I only saw the latter part of it, but I do not think it was large or marched far, as I could not detect any stragglers. I give it for what it is worth.

B. F. FISHER,

Major and Chief Signal Officer.
