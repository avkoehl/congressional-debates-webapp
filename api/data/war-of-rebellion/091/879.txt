HEADQUARTERS,September 25, 1864. (Via Waynesborough.)

Lieutenant General J. A. EARLY,

Port Republic:

Telegram* of this date received. More cavalry will be sent to Lynchburg if it can be arranged to spare any from here. If desirable send it elsewhere than Lynchburg when Kershaw unites with you. If you feel strong enough better move at once after the enemy and attack him, and if possible destroy him. I will advise you if cavalry is sent.

R. E. LEE,

General.
HEADQUARTERS,September 26, 1864.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond:

General Early reports enemy advanced against him on the 24th at New Market, when he fell back to Port Republic to unite with Kershaw. On the 25th the enemy advanced toward Harrisonburg, his cavalry having probably passed that place.

R. E. LEE.

PETERSBURG, September 26, 1864.

General J. A. EARLY,

Mechum's River, Va.:

Rosser leaves in the morning. Telegraph to Burkeville whether he shall proceed to Lynchburg, via Scottsville, to join you. Better attach [one] brigade of the cavalry to him and another to Wickham. Lomax could manage rest.

R. E. LEE.

General BRAGG:

General Early states all the reserves from the Valley have been called away. If possible they should be returned and everything done to strengthen him. Please see that the shoes, arms, and ammunition he requires be sent him.

R. E. LEE.
