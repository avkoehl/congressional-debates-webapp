HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,March 30, 1865-8.15 p. m.

Brevet Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

General Griffin has taken no prisoners to-day except from Scales' brigade. One of them, Private Guest, Thirty-fourth North Carolina, states his brigade is composed of Thirty-fourth, Twenty-second, and Sixteenth North Carolina. Scales was not present in their charge to-day; the brigade was led by Major Norman [Norment]. There are four brigades in Wilcox's division, commanded by General Scales, Colonels Howe [Hyman], Gallaway, and Stowe. They left the works in front of our signal tower at 3 o'clock this morning. Thinks all the brigades of his division were present to-day, but is not sure. General Wilcox is absent on leave.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
