ADJOURNMENT TILL MONDAY.
Mr. BLAIR, of Virginia. I rise to a privileged
question. I move that when the House adjourns
to-day it adjourn to meet on Monday next.
Mr. MALLORY. I move to amend so that
when the House adjourns it be to meet on the 2d
day of January next.
A Member. That must be by joint resolution.
Mr. MALLORY. Then I make the same prop-
osition m the shape of ajointresolution,and move
it as a substitute for the motion of the gentleman
from Virginia.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will say to the
gentleman that a joint resolution cannot be re-
ceived as an amendment to a simple resolution
of the House. The principle is the same as the
amending of a resolution by a bill, which is ex-
pressly prohibited.
Mr. Blair's motion was then agreed to.
ADJOURNMENT OVER THE HOLIDAYS.
Mr. MALLORY. I now move, the Semite con-
curring, that when the House adjourns on Tues-
day next, it adjourn to meet on the 2d day of Jan-
uary next.
Mr. LOVEJOY. I object.
Mr. MALLORY. I submit it as a question of
privilege.
Mr. LOVEJOY. Is that a question of privilege'
The SPEAKER. The Chair decided, on a
former occasion, that it was not a question of
privilege; but the House, by a laige majority,
oveiruled his decision. The Chair will there-
fore decidc that the resolution must be received as
a question of privilege.
Mr. LOVEJOY. That was in the last Congress,
as I understand. I do not think that ought to con-
trol the decisions of the present occupant of the
chair.
Mr. MALLORY. Well, sir, I present it as a
question of privilege; and J. think, if the Chair
will adhere to his decision, the House will come
to its senses: and sustain the Speaker. [Laughter.]
The SPEAKER. The Chair, m accordance
with the decision of the House, will entertain the
resolution as a question of privilege.
Mr. MALLORY. 1 will modify the motion so
as to make the adjournment until the first Monday
in January next.
Mr. BLAKE. I demand the yeas and nays
upon the adoption of the resolution.
Mr. F. A. CONKLING. I move to amend by
substituting 14 the 2d day of January" for "the
first Monday of January."
Mr. MALLORY. I desire to say that the 2d
day of January is Friday. Wc should do nothing
in the remaining two days of that week, and I think
the resolution, therefore, might as well stand as
I have offered it.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I will suggest
to the gentleman from Kentucky that it will be
better to postpone action on his resolution until
Monday. Wc shall be then better prepared to
determine the propriety of an adjournment for so
long a period.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will state that
debate is only in order by unanimous consent.
Mr. MALLORY. I am willing that the reso-
lution shall be postponed until Monday next,
with the understanding that the vote be taken at
one o'clock.
Mr. LOVEJOY. I object. I think we might
as well decide now what the House is going to do.
The SPEAKER. It is the duty of the Chair to
put the motion to the House.
The question was then taken, and the resolu-
tion was postponed until Monday next, at one
o'clock, p. m.

Mr. ALDR1CH. I am instructed to ask that

take precedence, if the proposition of the gentle-
