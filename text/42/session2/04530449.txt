The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair pre-
sents, at the request of the Yearly Meeting of
the Religious Society of Friends, held in New
York, their memorial to the President, the
Senate, and the House of Representatives of
the United States, against war, as not only
at variance with Christianity, but also with
morality and the best interests'of the human
family; (hat it is a scourge of indescribable
magnitude, bringing incalculable evils upon
those nations that resort to it as a means of
settling their differences, hailing with joy the
recent arrangement by which the settlement ot
the differences between our Government and
that of Great Britain was referred to a court
of high commission ; and respectfully entreat-
ing that the attention of the President and of
Congress maybe earnestly directed to the pro-
motion of arrangements for the settlement of
any future national differences that may arise
by arbitration rather than by a resort to the
sword. The memorial will be referred to the
Committee on Foreign Relations.
Mr. CONKLING. .Mr. President, I have in
my hand a carefully prepared and thoughtful
memorial of the Chamber of Commerce of the
State of New York. It relates to the depres-
sion of the American shipping interest, and
sets forth facts and opinions which I believe
to be entitled to great weight. It recommends
the adoption of measures tor the payment of
liberal compensation for mail service per-
formed by lines of American steamers sailing
to foreign ports. There are topics in this
memorial which belong to one of the commit-
tees of this bodjf, and topics which belong to
another; and this suggests a doubt to my mind

ought to be printed, I make a motion to that
effect.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If the memorial
were printed, the Senator could then have it
referred to two committees, if he desired, a
part to each committee. If there be no objec-
tion, this memorial, which is elaborate, will be
