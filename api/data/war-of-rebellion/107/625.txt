Brigadier General J. S. WADSWORTH,

Commanding Military District, Washington:

SIR: By Tuesday next I wish you would order Brigadier-General Doubleday to take post opposite Fredericksburg, and send with him, or after him, the major part of the force you now have on the Maryland side of the Potomac, leaving only small guards in the various field-works.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

IRVIN McDOWELL,

Major-General, Commanding.

GENERAL WOODBURY'S CAMP,

Near Railroad Bridge, May 22, 1862-7.30 p. m.

General J. G. BARNARD,

At General McClellan's Headquarters:

General Keyes was only able to furnish about 500 axes and shovels to-day, but promises 1,600 to-morrow morning. Have begun a rifle-pit at the Chimney and a slashing from there toward railroad bridge. I propose to-morrow to carry the slashing from Chimneys to left and right and begin another rifle-pit in clearing between Chimneys and railroad. Their scouts keep in sight of our men, but show in no force. To-day half the men worked at Bottom's Bridge to make it passable and clear up the trees as you directed McAlester to do. I propose to stay at General Woodbury's camp if that will do as well; it will be much more satisfactory.

C. B. COMSTOCK,

Lieutenant of Engineers.
