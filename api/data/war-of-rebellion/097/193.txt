HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,March 26, 1865.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: With respect to the Eighth Corps, my intention was to suggest the formation into a corps of all the infantry troops not required along the railroad, and to recommend Major-General Couch for the command. I do not know a more reliable major-general. But I did not propose to include the troops along the railroad, many of whom are enlisted for that special service. There is also a considerable amount of cavalry in the department. Would it form part of the corps? I do not see the advantage of the corps organization unless composed of the troops likely to serve together here or elsewhere. The department commander of West Virginia and his district commanders can, ordinarily, manage affairs along the railroad with the troops permanently under their command. But it seems to me informing a corps it would be better to exclude the troops along the railroad. A corps could be composed of the remains of the Nineteenth-two new divisions under General Brooke and Egan, and, I hope, another under General Carroll. If the corps so formed was called on for service elsewhere the cavalry falling under command of the department commander would, with the permanent garrisons, suffice to protect the railroad.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

Please inform General Brooke that Colonel Duryea, Seventh New York Heavy Artillery, has been ordered to report to him for assignment to the command of a brigade. He will probably arrive to-morrow.
