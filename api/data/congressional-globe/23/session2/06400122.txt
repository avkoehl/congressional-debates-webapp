THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 13,
to suspend the rule for the purpose of taking up
the resolution, which was negatived
The following resolution, heretofore offered by
Mr  CHILTON, was again taken up
Resolved, That the Committee on Roads and
Canals be instructed to inquire into the subject
and report their opinion to this House, of the
¿host equal and just mode of applying the revenues
of the country to such works of public improve-
ment within the íespeetive States of this Union as
may be necessary for the facilitating of commerce
with foreign nations, and among the several States.
And that they moreover report their opinion of
the best and most practicable mode of ascertaining
and determining the nationality and importance of
such improvements as may be proposed within
the said several States.
Mr CHILTON continued the line of argument
he pursued when he last adriiessed the House, by
refeinng to the respective votes given by General
Jackson and Mr Van Buren, in the Senate of the
United States, in the Eighteenth Congress, the
former of whom invaiiably voted m support of,
and the latter in opposition to, objects ot internal
improvement Mr C quoted tne votes on the
Cumbeiland road bill, and the amendment pro-
posed to that measure by Mr Smith, and others,
and lead many extracts from the Journals of the
Senate, all of which went to show, among other
things, that if Mr Van Buren preservedh if consist-
ency he would make a veiy indifferent Piesident
for the interests of the w'estein countiy,and which
he ttusted would be borne in mind elsewheie, if
not in that House General Jackson, in Mr C 's
opinion, was then light, but if so, he comd not
now be right, unless both sides of the question
could be right, for he now opoosed what he then
supported It vas not for him, however, to ac
count for the strange inconsistencies of public
men, noi for the s'iange union that sometimes took
place, all of a sudden, between men heietofore ot
opposite principles He had only stated facts,
and pioved them upon the testimony of undem
able record He hoped he had been successful in
showing that the course advocated My General
Jackson in 1823—'4, had been precisely the leveise
of the couise he pursued now, and hehad finished
this branch of his aigument He disclaimed any
perbonal feeling on t'ie inconsistency of that gen-
tleman, but he had experienced that the man who
adhered to his prin iples, and refused to fly from
them, was denounced, and sauificed undei the
chaiacter of an apostate, while the man who could
lead thousands aftei him, mignt renounce Ins
former principles, pursue an opposite couise, and
be eulogized to the skies
Having said as much as he intended on the
couise of General Jackson, it would not be amiss
to inquue how the public money had been dis
posed ol and distributed during the present Ad-
ministration The public Treasuiy was the com-
mon psoperty of all, and no one portion or section
of the country was entitled to preference ovei
another It would be seen that gioss pirtiality,
of the most invidious chai actei, had been exeicised
in i s distribution foi objects of internal improve
ment, so much so, that he had rither see it bus
pended, or foiever abandoned, than earned on as
it had been He was for equil justice, and f>i
seeing its benefits equally d iTuseJ thioughoU
eveiy portion of die [it ipli Mi C said hehad
at considerable labor, from a close comparison of
the different lepoifs made 'othat Jlou^e, nrcpared
a table ihowm  the different sum" expended for
fortifications, 1 ght houses and wuks of internal
improvement geneially, wlii h would show the
mode and niannei in wmch h s s}stem had been
earned on He muted the mention of membets
to it particu'arly for every member 1 id eonsttt
uents, arid ino e constituents weie all ínteres ed
in ti  s ques ion

sums that had been ap¡ lopnated by Congress foi
the three objects aoo^e inferred to, classed ui del

his intention of publishing it heieaftei, m a coi

Fiom t'i s, «aid Mi C , i' would be percened
what gross, injustice had been done to «everal
States Laige amounts had been expended for
the eas ern States, while, m some cases, none,
and in most of the western States very little had
been appropriated for them. What apology was
there for this invidious distinction' He knew of
none that could be urged, but this, that the west
ern country, from its peculiar position, not being
on the sea board, having neither fortifications,
harbors, light houses,&c ,noi needing any, there-
fore required no portion of these appropriations,
or were not entitled to any All that we needed in
aid of our commerce was the construction of road*
and the improvementof our rivers Now, he would
call upon  very one, from the President down to
any one of his friends, either in that House or
out of it, to exhibit that constitutional authority
which authorized improvements by the General
Government on the sea board, which did not apply
equally to those inland ' In what part, or in what
clause of the Constitution of the United States,
was the distinction diawn ' I assert this position
said Mr. C Either that the whole or both are
constitutional, or that they are unconstitutional
There was no distinction of cases whatever, there
was no half way couise between them If one
was constitutional, the other was equally so He
should be glad to hear any gentleman point out
the distinction, or refei to a solitary section or
law in the Constitution of the United States, tnat
authorized the makirg of one class of impiove
ment, that did not equally authonze the construc-
tion of others No such distinction did exist—
and he would defy the most finished or acute lati-
tudinarian to point it out Hehad heard it assert
ed, that those improvements had been made under
the authority of that clause of the Const tution
which says that Con'ress shall have power " to
legulate commerce with foreign nations," but how
could it have escaped the observation of gentle
men that the same clause has these woids also,
" and among the several States'" the two powers
were identical, granted under one and the same
clause of the Federal Constitution, -nd no man
could asseit that any distinction existed If then
itbenotundei that power, under what othei power
was it derived ' Was it under that clause which
impowered Congress, " to provide for the common
defence and general welfare of the United States'"
If it be claimed under this clause, no man could
dare say that the President of the United States
or Congress had provided for the "general wel
faie" by squandering all the public money upon
the e-xtenoi States, to the almost total exclusion
of the interior The clause embraced eveiy part
of the Union, and was intended to leach each and
eveiy State equally, and without paitiahty or
prejudice The conduct that had been puisued
resein lied thatofarnan possessed of a fine estate,
who should expend the whole of his means in
adorning the exteuor, while he left the whole of
the mtenor a barren wilderness Mi C was

THE ARMY APPROPRIATION BILL.
The House resumed the unfinished business of
yesterday, being on the amendments proposed in
the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union, to add an appropriation for" arrearages in
the Pay Department of the Army, ¡¡,6,080 05 "
Mr POLK said he had but a tew words to
address to the House on this amendment, and if he
failed to convince every member on that floor of
the justice of that item, he was peifectly willing
the subject should be sent to one of the standing
committees of the House He regretted that the
honorable chanman of the Committee of Claims
[Mr Whittlesey] was not then in his seat, as he
believed the documents he held in his hand would
be perfectly satisfactoiy to him, and would ob-
viate all his objections to the amendment Mr P
stated that this amount of arrearages accrued
between the years 1818, and 1821, while General
Macomb was commanding at Detroit, and was the
differeace between his oidmaiy pay asa Brigadier
and Ins pay as a Major General by brevet This
allowance had been made to Generals Scott and
Itit ley at the same time, and under similar cir-
cumstances Mr P here produced various docu-
ments fiom the depaitments, and the opinion of
the Attorney Geneial, which were then read He
conclude! by expressing the belief that the ex
planattons which he had submitted to the House
would be perfectly satisfactory, and that no further
objections would be urged against the appropua-
tion If such objections, however, still existed,
he had no personal feelings in the matter, it might
go to a standing committee But should that
course be taken, Mr P suggested that it would
probably prevent the action of Congress on the
subject at its piesent session
Mr MANN said he had not yet had sufficient
time to examine the effect of this amendment,
since it was placed befor  the House last evening
He wished to know the difference between the
brevet a id the ordinary pay In order tnat mem
bers mig it have some opportunity for investigation,
he hoped the chairman ot the Committee of Ways
ind Means [\ir Polr] would surfer it to lay on
the table at least ano her di.y
Mr WILLIAMS wished to adveit to one fact
which did not seen to haie s'ruck the attention
of the Hou^e A «minie resolution of that House
co ild give no po ver to the Seci etai y of War to
pass upon and pay the chum of Geneial Macomb
It would lequire a joint resolut on to confer such
a powei But, Mr W said, he was opposed to the
amendment because the subject seemed to de
mand the investigation of a standing fotraii tee
of the House Nothing, he contended, should
ever be inserted m an appropuation bill, unless it
weie of the most lnduoitahle ch roctei On the
justice of this claim there seemed to exist se-
lious doubts among various members of the
House
Mr McKJNLEY followed with some genera
remarks on ¡he claim, wlucn seemed to be founded
