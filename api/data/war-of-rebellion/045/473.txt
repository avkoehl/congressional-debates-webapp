Major-General COUCH, Harrisburg, Pa.:

There seems to be a strong probability of a battle not far from Emmitsburg. It is hoped that you will assist General Meade, by operating on the enemy's left flank or left rear, toward Gettysburg.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Dispatch received. I have sent out a force in the direction of Carlisle. It has been attacked by a body of cavalry, at least, and just now things do not look well.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

My column is just moving into camp. Your telegram of this date received. Brigadier-General Elliott was left at Harper's Ferry. He has about 4, 000 men. I will march to-morrow.

WM. H. FRENCH,

General, Commanding.

FREDERICK CITY, MD., July 1, 1863.

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I arrived from Knoxville this afternoon with my command, numbering 6, 000 men of all arms; 5, 000 infantry, 700 cavalry, and three batteries (3-inch guns), in good order. I left behind at Harper's Ferry 4, 000 men, under Brigadier- General Elliott; about 600 of whom should join me in a few days. I shall proceed to-morrow to make arrangements for carrying out your instructions received to-night. I should like to have Smith's brigade of two regiments, now part of Elliott's, as soon as his command passes Point of Rocks, particularly as Lowell's regiment of cavalry has been ordered by General Halleck to escort his canal- boats to Washington. I shall send as soon as possible 200 stragglers, whom I have in confinement, belonging to the Army of the Potomac. I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. H. FRENCH,

Major-General.
