HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 12, 1864 - 7.50 p. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps, at General Hancock's or Wright's Hdqrs.:

The major-general commanding directs me to inform you that General Wright is ordered to return to you the divisions of Cutler and Griffin. He directs that you take a position with your corps on the right of General Wright, extending in the direction of your headquarters this morning so as to cover the roads leading to our rear in that vicinity. The line occupied should be entrenched, and should be the shortest practicable, so as to afford the greatest number of men available to meet an attack to-morrow, should one be made. The army will not resume the offensive to-morrow. Please inform the adjutant-general where your headquarters are as soon as selected, so that they may be connected by telegraph.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
