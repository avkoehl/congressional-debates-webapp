THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 25.
war, because wo have gone over the negotiations
once and gone over them unsuccessfully.
Mr. PIKE, i would ask the gentleman fur-
ther, whether twenty-five vessels were not, from
time to time, seized and condemned without in-
terference from the Government?
Mr. ELIOT. That does not touch the argu-
ment at all; It only shows that in those partic-
ular cases the seizures were correct, and that the
gentleman's constituents violated the law and suf-
fered the consequences.
Now, whether these fishermen care to fish within
a quarter of a mile of land or not is an unimport-
ant question at this time. *
But let the vessels of these gentlemen whose
letters their able Representative has read be seized
on the ocean,fishing, as they will contend, more
than three miles from land, but within three miles,
as the captor vessel will contend, then what? We
know what from past history. No matter who
owns these vessels, nor from what region upon the
seaboard he may have come, if he is the hum-
blest citizen that owes allegiance to this Govern-
ment our nation stands pledged to maintain his
rights; for ins rights become yours and mine,
and they cannot he trampled upon with impunity.
But is it not wise, when exciting; questions have
been adjusted as these have been by this reci-
procity treaty, to avoid their renewed discussion
if Great Britain is disposed to revise this treaty
and to renew it? If she is not disposed, then, I
say, let the consequences come.
The gentleman fiom Vermont and the gentle-
man from Maine have, however, adduced some
arguments to which I wish to reply. Both of
these gentlemen contend and believe that the
treaty will have been in operation ten years in
September of this year. If that is so, then, in
oroer to have the benefit of the year, notice of
abrogation should be given this fall. I cannot
agree to that view. The final proclamation nf ihe
President was made March 10, 1855, (United
States Statutes, volume ten, page 1179,) and it may
be well doubted whether the treaty "came into
operation" before then, Hut that is not of eon-
sequence now*. The President, if this resolution
shall now pass, will be guided by jus own judg-
ment, aided by his official advisers, and wi 1! not
give the notice until the period of ten ycais shall
have passed.
But the gentleman from Vermont argues that
there has been no reciprocity at all, and the gen-
tleman from Maine follows up the argument.
What reciprocity it is said, is there in sending
cotton free into Canada when Canada raises no
cotton? What right have we to,find fault with
that? We have a free mat ket for our cotton,and
that I suppose is what we want. But he asks,
whose ax is ground because gi indstones are pei-
mitted to come in free from Canada? We make
no grindstones. Well, then, it is not the colonial
ox that is ground, surely ! The gentleman says:
u What reclpioeity is there in making eotton fiee to the
United Stales from Canada when Canada produces no cot-
ton? 'King Cotton' wns m no dimmer honi lon^ sUple

But the markets of Montreal and of Canada
generally are available to the United States. So
far as the article of cattle is concerned, although
we have imported more animals than we have
sent to them, nevertheless wesentto them in 185.5
an amounlworth £207,580; and between 1^53and
1802 we have sent values \aiying from $473,607
in 1S5G to £i317,i)3(j in 1862. So far, then, as any
complaint in this respect against the reciprocity
treaty is concerned, it must rest upon the ground
indicated by the gentleman from PennsyUama,
[Mr. Stevens,] that wo had better import these
articles trom countties where we can impose a
duty upon them. Rut it is said that our iorcsts"
are inexhaustible, and that we do not want lum-
ber from the provinces. That is not true at the
North, I nppichcnd. I think the gentleman from
Maine will not deny that the Ashburton treaty
opened to this country the last untouched forest
in New England. 1 have a communication upo^
this subject from Mr. Sabine, who has been of-
ficially engaged and speaks from knowledge, and
to which I will call the attention of the House.
He
"In 852 I was appointed agent of the Treasury Depart-
ment, Yor the special purpose of making a minute exam-
ination of the region on the upper wateis of the liver St.
John and its tubutaries, and tins service was tendered.
Nothing necessary to the faithful peil'ormance of the duiy
aligned to me was neglected. I discoursed fieely with
loggers, sawypjg, river drivers, &c., to obtain the inform-
•ation which Mr. Coiwin wished, touching the operation
of that treaty, [the Ashburton tieaty.) I w^i amazed at
the extent of the business winch had origin only nine or
ten years previously. Since that time, laige mills have
been erected near the city of St. John at the mouth of the
river, by several of my old friends in Maine. The mem-
bers of Congress from that State, whatever their opinion
upon the continuance of the recipiocity treaty, will tell
>ou that though spruce and hemlock true® uie &till
oient lor the present, pines fit for doors, casing, and the
general finish ot buildings are becoming scarce on the St.
Croix, Maebia--, Penobscot, Kennebec, and the Saco. At
the West the case is quite different, as I well know, lor
Chicago has supplanted Bangor as the capital of Lumber-
do n."
So far as this article of lumber is concerned,
the "West will find more than compensation for
any loss (if any has been occasioned, which I do
not believe,) in the benefits otherwise derived from
the treaty.
It is said that by this treaty " the ancient laws
of trade have been subverted, and our exports to
Canada, which formally largely exceeded our im-
ports, are now greatly less. They sell to us but
go elsewhere to buy." The Secretary of the
Treasury tells a very different story. During the
ten years prior to 1863 we exported to Canada
valuesto the amount ot $170,635,000. During that
same time we imported Ironi Canada$152,051,000.
We sold to them m excess of what they sold to
us #18,584,000.
Our annual sales exceeded our annual purchases
by $1,858,400. The gentleman from Maine [Mr.
Pike] has given in his speech a tabular statement
from winch it would appear that we have imported
fiom the whole of these piovinces less than we
have expoi ted, liming the oxislencrof this tieaty,
to the amount ol 774,000. And yet it is said
that they sell to us but go _ elsewhere to buy.
Why,sit, the fact is that they buy more from us
than they do fiom all the rest of the world to-
gether. From 1855 to 18G0 (inclusive) the entire
imports into Canada were ^215,982,776. Of that
aggregate $114325l)5345 were impoits from the
United States, and from all other countries
$101,723,431; so that during that time Canada
bought of us more than she did from all other
countries to the amount of $12,535,914, equal to
$2,08!),31'J annually.
The gentleman from Vermont refeis to ourex-
ports of coin. He says:
u The amount of our export of coin for ihH yenr I have
been unable to ascertain, but Canadian retains credit us
in 18(52 with $2,530,000, and in lbt33with ;$3,502,1^0. That
it vva^ much more theie can be no reasonabledoubt. The
fan inlerence would be that not less, than $10,01)0,000 are
annually drawn from us m gold, or it^ equivalent, to pay
fut agueulunai ptodueiions not required, and to glut niai-
kets, whic.li oni own people are all tin* while easier to sup-
ply We have no leeipioeiiy tieaty w i!h any other eoun-
ny, and no othei pie^ent^ so uufavoiable .i balance sheet.
i-Wen om tiade with China is more piofualile.''
Fiom this it would appear that the balance of
trade is largely against us. But 1 have shown
that to fhe end of the yeat 18G3—the lineal year—
Canada had in ten years bought of us $18,500,000
moie than we bought of her. Have we suffered
a dram of $10,000,000 in gold, or its equivalent,
us the fruits of reciprocity ? Our exports to Can-
ada m 18G3 were $19,6^8,718, our impoits were
$18,810,999, showing a balance in our favor of
$1,081,719. And what isthefactas to gold—are
com iemittane.es ull one way? It would seem to
be so fiom the argument. But the same tables
to which I liuve refcried show that although we
did export as it was said in 18G3 coin to the
amount of $3,502,180, we imported m that same
year in coin $4,892,195, showing a balance in our
favor of $1,590,015, and nearly alt of that was due
to us to pay for ihe difference between our ex-
ports ami our impoits.
Mr. MOItRILL. The gentleman will allow
me to say that his statement applies to all the
piovinces, while mine applied only to theCanadas.
Mr. ELIOT. We find from the statistical
tables furnished by the Secretary of the Tieas-
ury that sincc the treaty has been in operation
we have sold to the British provinces nearly
twenty-six and a half millions more than they
have sold to us. Within eight years we have
sold to Canada nearly twenty-three million bush-
els of wheat and have bought from them some-
what less than twenty-one million bushels. Our
western and central grain-growers have been ben-
efited, for it happens* that the Canadians prefer
thegrain of Illinois and Wisconsin. They know-
there is grit somewhere in Illinois and Wiscon-
sin, but they believe the grit is in the people and
not in the grain.
During the five years before 1861, we have sent
to all the provinces $6,000,000 in breads^fFs more
than we have received from them. And yet the
gentleman says that the Canadians go elsewhere
to buy.
The gentleman from Maine [Mr. Pike] says
that this treaty has affected our commercial and
shipping interests adversely because the carrying
trade is done in colonial bottoms and not in Amer-
ican bottoms. If he will look at the report made
this year by the Committeeon Commerce, he will
see that from 1856 to 1861 there were entered in
our ports from Canadian provinces ten million
tons of American tonnage and six million tons of
foreign tonnage; and that there were cleared to
Canada at the same time ten million tons of Amer-
ican tonnage and seven millions of foreign ton-
nagc.
Mr. MORRILL. I suppose thegentleman from
Massachusetts would wish to be corrected on this
subject, and I desire to correct him. The state-
ment he quotes shows the amount of stuff trans-
ported over our rail roads and not in vessels. The
gentleman will find that there were no other means
of making up the tables than to include what is
carried on railroads as well as in vessels.
Mr. ELIOT. I must refer the gentleman to
the report from which I take the statement. But
I will annex the statement itself.
The following table shows the nationality of
the vessels employed in the carrying trade be-
tween the United States and the British North
American provinces during the last five yeais:

It cannot be fairly denied by any one who ex-
amines the facts officially within our reach that
so much advantage has accrued to us from the
treaty that it is the part of wisdom to connect
with a notice of abrogation an expression of will-
ingness to renew upon terms mutually satisfac-
