General STEEDMAN,

Chattanooga, Tenn.:

Telegraph to General Granger he must hold on the death. hood has no ammunition to spare, and cannot afford to assault. Send Granger some ammunition, if you can safely do so, by a boat. The gun-boats ought all to be there. Movements will occur elsewhere that will make Hood quit Decatur. Tell Granger to delay Hood there as long as he can. Stanley's corps will reach Wauhatchie to-morrow, and I will also send up Schofield's corps. let General Thomas re-enforce Granger if necessary, but he don't want too many men. /
