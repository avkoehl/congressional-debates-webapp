CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
tation of the State of Mississippi? It was clear
that the State of Mississippi had no representatives
in Congress on the 4th of March last Thai being
the case, he apprehwided there was a v acancy, and
such a %acaticy as was contemplated by the
framer  of the Constitution of the United States,
uhichthe Governor was authorized to fill by spe-
cial election He then went mto an examination
of the mealing of the word " happen " Horr.e
"Iiioke had said that words of doubtful mean-
ing were mado tiie everlasting engines of
fraud and oppression, but he hoped that the
Sta'e of Mississippi was not to be made the % íe-
tim of scholastic technicalities If this word was
ci doub ul meaning, the most liberal construction
should be placed upon it, and iraud and oppres-
sion «Should not be practised upon tne State of Mis-
sissippi m consequence thereof But he contended
trmt the word was not one about which diere w as
much doubt, because almost all lexicographers
agreed on this point, that whatever comes to pass,
whetkei tn the course of things 01 out «/the natural
crii-i, happens Others placed this definition on the
word ' hanptn " "to intervene," "to fall out"
The on'} ouestion which appeared to be raised,
w as, v hether a vacancy had "happened " Then
had it intervened, had it fallen out, had it come to
pass, that there was a vacancy in the representa-
tion of the State of Mississippi 1 He contended
that it had, and held that "happening" might íefer
as well to a thing foreseen or foreknown, as to a
thing not foieseen or not foreknown
Mr B then referred to a case of \acancy wh ch
occuiri.d in an office which was to be filled bj the
Executive under the following clause of the Consti-
tution, as a parallel cast "The President shall
h ivo power to fill all vacancies that may happen
dui nig the recess ot the Senate, by granting com-
missions which shall expire at the end of their next
s ssion " The vicincj had oecuned duung the
session ot the Senate, but, from some cause or
othei, wax not filled up, and the Executive having
seme doubts as to whether he ha I the right to fill
the -vacancy, took the opinion of Attorney Gene-
ral Wirt on the matter, and he pi iced this con-
struction upon the word ' happen " His opinion
was, ' that the President had the right 'o fill any
vacancy which might happen to exxst in the recess
of ihc ¡senate " There was another cas  ,n whicn

Mr CVMBRLLEN& hai mg the permissi n of
the gentleman fiom Geoigia, said he would explain
more fully his answer to one of tnat gentleman s
questions, last evening, concerning the condition of
the banks in the State of New York He did not
mean to be understood that any of them, strictly
?p°a!< rg, were insolvent, or that they could "not
ulti lately pav all their notes
Mr C had referred to the Dry Dock Bank,
which was placed ivy tie Chancellor m the hands
of íeceivers, and to the heavy losses sustained by
many of the banks in the late revulsion By re-
ference to the Treasury report, it would be seen
that one of the city banks alone had $1,200,000
of suspended debt, yet ei en that bank would, m a
few years, restore its capital to its original amount,
by its collections and profits He had merely in-
tended to express that the actual capitals of many
of the banks had been diminished during the re-
vulsion He begged to be understood as entertain-
ing no hostile feelings towards the gentlemen inte-
rested in those institutions, nor to I anks as the mere
agents of trade, but to that legislation which is
perpetually and improperly interfering with this,
as well as other branches of trade His hostility
was exclusively directed to this mischievous and
con uptmg interference with the business oí men,
which was not among the legitimate duties of Go-
vernment
Mr DAWSON then concluded his remarks m
opposition to the bill, and went on to point out
what he conceived to be its partial effects
Mr TOWNS replied to his colleague on the par-
ticular points referred to by that gentleman
Mi GRAVES spoke at length against the bill
till about 3 o clock, when he gave wai to
Mr PHILLIPS, who moved that the House
take a recess foi one hour

"Vfter some suggestions from Messrs JOHN-

E\ FN1NG SESSI0V
Upon the assembling of the House at half past
four o'clock, there being but vsryfew members
pre'senf,
Mr McKAY mo\ed a call of the House, and,
upon taking the question, there appeared aves 38,
noes 38, the Chair-voting m the afnrmatne, the
call was accordingly ordeied, and a quorum having
appeared, its further proceedings were dispensed
with
DEPOSITE LAW
The House resumed the considera ion of the
" bill to postpone the tourth instalment of deposites
with the States "
Mr GRAVES concluded h i leiruks. in oppo-
sition to the bill, and to the pohev oí the admini-
stration generally, on the subject of fuia i-es He
denied that the bills purposed would aflord an}
relief to the counti}, but en tie cmtraij, that,
under the guise of relief, thtv would have ro other
effect than to augment the picture On this posi-
tion he dwelt at length, and entered into a v.i ietv
ot statements, drawn fiom the condition of the
bank  and the co irs  of trade, especially m the
west, to substantiate it
Mr CUSHMAN rose and remarked that this
question had long been ver} consideiabl and i ery
fullv discussed, and, he belie\ed, to t!nj satslaction
r everv gentleman of the Houss He believed
that any further discussion o1 it woel 1 be ent iely
useless, and the House w as w orn down with the
debate Still, he confessed, he should be veiy
happy it the House would then pass upon the seve-
ral amendments submitted in Committee of the
Whole, it it could be done without further delav
He rose foi the purpose of asl mg v hether it w a
not the sense of the Hous„ thit the discussion hud
been carried *s fai as it ought 'o be' v hether the
subject had rot been fully and lauly debated__sur-
ficiently debated?   In the full beliei that it had it
was his intention to call for the pie\ious question
but although he had risen for that purpose,   he
would make this proposition—
Mr ROBERTSON I call the gent email to ol-
der     The previoas q lestion cannot be debated
Mi CU&HMAN I am going to nial e this pro-
position If it meets the general appiobation ot
the House to close the debate, I should be willing
to have the vote taken upon eery rmenJn entj
and give the mo\ ers of them an opportumtv oi cal-
ling foi the jeas and nays on each Toi the pin-
pose, how ever, of testing the sense oí the House
to bring this discussion to a c'ose, I move the pic-
vious question
