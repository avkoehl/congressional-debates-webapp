HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,February 7, 1865-1.15 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Commanding Second Corps:

GENERAL: I have just received your dispatch by Major Palmer. I have ordered two brigades of Gregg's to Rowanty Post-Office by General Meade's order. Having Wheaton's division, of the Sixth Corps, i think I shall not need any support from you. My instructions leave me to attack so far as I think practicable, and if what I have will not succeed my defensive arrangements are ample. General Crawford's division has retaken the enemy's advance rifle-pits near Armstrong's Mill and is pushing the enemy toward Dabney's Mill, where their line of battle is said to be. We have drawn the enemy's artillery fire from the north side of Hatcher's Run. If any of your artillery can eely to these guns it would be desirable, for moral effect if for no other, and if your artillery near Armstrong's Mill would fire to the west of the sound of musketry firing in front of General Crawford it might have the same advantage.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,February 7, 1865-12.40 p. m.

General MILES:

GENERAL: The commanding general desires me to say that General Warren is now carrying on some operations that may necessitate him (General Humphreys) to take away one-half of General Hartranft's force. If such should be the case you will be notified, and it may be that the general will be obliged to call upon you for your available force.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SEPT. CARNCROSS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,February 7, 1865-10.15 a. m.

General SMYTH:

You will strengthen the rifle-pits in the vicinity of the R. Armstrong house. Captain Howell, of the engineers, will superintend the work. The parapet should be four feet wide on top, so as to resist artillery.

By order of Major-General Humphreys.

SEPT. CARNCROSS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
