NEAR FRANKLIN, October 1, 1864.

Major-General SMITH:

I encountered the enemy this morning at 9 o'clock about two miles east of Franklin, they having occupied the town early this morning. I have driven them into the town and they have opened upon me with

one piece of artillery. I an tell nothing of their force, but don't think it large. I have no cavalry here, and my artillery is where it cannot be unloaded from train. Have you any instructions?

E. H. WOLFE,

Colonel.

FRANKLIN, MO., October 1, 1864.

Major-General SMITH:

I entered this place at 12 m. to-day, driving the enemy with but little difficulty. They are reported by what few citizens left to be 2,000 strong, with four pieces of artillery. They have plundered the town and destroyed considerable railroad track. I have no doubt the Meramec bridge in front has been destroyed. Everything is now quiet.

E. H. WOLFE,

Colonel, Commanding Third Brigade.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Arrived here about 2 p. m.; have just been getting an idea of the situation. Scouts have been sent out in the direction of enemy's reported retreat; not yet returned. Will report when they arrive.

Cannonading heard about the time of my arrival; believed to be enemy's, gone in direction of Gray's Summit. Cannot yet learn accurately what has become of enemy. Please let me have any information that may be useful to me.

LEWIS MERRILL,

Colonel, Commanding.

FRANKLIN, October 1, 1864-4.15 p. m.

Colonel J. V. DU BOIS,

Chief of Staff:

Received your note this a. m. at 7 o'clock, and started for Franklin at once. You say, "Why did not you go to Franklin with all your command as ordered?" This morning the order was positive. The order left Saint Louis at 1 p. m. yesterday and reached me at 5 or 6, and ordered me simply to move my headquarters to Franklin, scouting west and south side; nothing about my command except that I was to guard the fords of Meramec. At the time your order reached me I sent reconnaissance to Franklin to ascertain the truth of a rumor that the enemy was there, intending to leave next morning. there is nothing in the order signed by Captain Bennett directing me to move my headquarters that indicated any haste.

LEWIS MERRILL,

Colonel, Commanding.
