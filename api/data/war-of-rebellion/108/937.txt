GenerL R. E. LEE.:

GENERAL: I have just received a note from Generqal Chambliss. He has been driving in enemy's pickets at Smith; 's Mill, and they in turn drove his bck. He has a good position at Stanard's Mill, and will not fail to discover a general advnce. Major Clement has orders, if forced back, tocross at Crutchfield's Mill Ford and join General Anderson's right. Ishould not judte from GenerL Chambliss' dispatch, anmd fromwhat his courier reports, that it was a general advance. GenerL Anderson will be kept informed of all ovements.

May 16, 1864 - 7.30 p. m.

GenerL R. E. LEE:

GENERAL: The eemy still ontinue to picket the any at Clark's Mill bridge and Smith's Mill bridge. General C[hambliss], with two regiments and two pieces of artillery, is at Stanard's Mill. His pickets extend to SMith's Mill and connect with vedettes at Quesenberry's in front of enemy's line. I can see little or no change since yesteday. I do not look upon their picketing Smith's Mill bridge as anything more than a security to their pickets at Masspaponax Church. I have sent scouts out andhope to hear from them in the morning.

Resepctfully,

W. H. F. LEE,

Major-General.
