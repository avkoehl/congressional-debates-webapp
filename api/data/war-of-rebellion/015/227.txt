cluding Colonel Geary at White Plains and the cavalry to be at his disposal, will amount to some 7,780 men, with twelve pieces of artillery. I have the honor to request that all the troops organized for service in Pennsylvania and Nw york and in any of the Eastern States may be ordered to Washington. I learn from Governor Curtin that there are some 3,500 men now ready in Pennsylvania. This force I should be glad to have sent at once to Manassas. Four thousand men from General Wadsworth I desire to be ordered to Manassas. These troops, with the railroad guards above alluded, to, will make up a force under the command of General Abercrombie to something like 18,639 men.

It is my design to push General Blenker's division from Warrenton upon Strasburg. He should remain at Strasburg, too, long enough to allow matters to assume a definite form in that region before proceeding to his ultimate destination.

The troops in the valley of the Shenandoah will thus, including Blencker's division, 10,028 strong, with twenty-four pieces of artillery; Bank's Fifth Corps, which embraces the command of General Shields, 19,687 strong, with forty-one guns; some 3,652 disposable cavalry and the railroad guards, about 2,100 men, amount to about 35,467 men.

It is designed to relieve General hooker by some regiment, say 850 men, leaving with some 500 cavalry, 1,350 men on the Lower Potomac.

To recapitulate:

Men.

At Warrenton there is to be............................... 7,780

At Manassas, say.......................................... 10,859

In the valley of the Shenandoah........................... 35,467

On the Lower Potomac...................................... 1,350

------

In all.................................................... 55,456

There would thus be left for the garrisons and the front of Washington under General Wadsworth some 18,000 men, exclusive of the batteries under instruction.

The troops organizing or ready for service in New York, I learn, will probably number more than 4,000. These should be assembled at Washington, subject to disposition where their services may be most needed.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
