Commissary-General of Prisoners, Washington, D. C.:

COLONEL: Inclosed I send you a report made by surgeon-in-chief and acting assistant inspector-general of the command, also letter of Colonel Pierson, as to the peculiar position of those prisoners desiring to return to their allegiance to the Government; also the complaints of Major-General Trimble. As far as possible the real evils are being remedied. A rigid system of policing is established, and the wells will be so fixed (not filled up) as that no surface water will run into them.
