HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, Washington, December 31, 1863.

Major-General AUGUR,Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: It is possible that General Kelley may aks for two or three regiments and some batteries to be sent to Harper's Ferry via railroad. General Meade will send up a brigade from his army to reports to you for this purpose, and General Barry will have the batteries in readiness. If the demand should be pressing from General Kelley, I hope you may be able to send him some infantry in advance of the arrival of the brigade from General Meade. No troops will be sent forward unless further demands are made from General Kelley or Harper's Ferry.

Yours, truly,

H. W. HALLEKC,

General-in-Chief.

CUMBERLAND, December 31, 1863-10 a.m.

Major-General COUCH,

Chambersburg:

Your telegram of yesterday received,and this morning received the order from the War Department. General Sullivan reports that General Early is moving down the Shenandoah Valley with a large force, and was last night between Strasburg and Winchester. I will therefore be compelled to detain Colonel Boyd's command until further developments, but will send it the earliest moment I can safely spare it. I presume the best route for him to take will be by Hagesrstown, as he is now near Harper's Ferry.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
