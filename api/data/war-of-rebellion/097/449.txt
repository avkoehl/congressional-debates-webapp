APRIL 2, 1865.

Colonel T. S. BOWERS,

City Point, Va.:

Notify Colonel Mulford to make no more deliveries of rebel prisoners whilst the battle is going on. Parke captured two forts and two redoubst this morning with their guns. I have not yet heard from Sheridan, but I have an abiding faith that he is in the right place and at the right time.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

T. BANKS' HOUSE, April 2, 1865-10.45 a.m.

Colonel BOWERS,

City Point, Va.:

Everything has been carried from the left of the Ninth Corps. The Sixth Corps alone captured more than 3,000 prisoners. The Second and Twenty-fourth Corps both captured forts, guns, and prisoners from the enemy, but I cannot yet tell the number. We are now closing around the works of the city immediately enveloping Petersburg. All looks remarkably well. I have not yet heard from Sheridan.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

BOYDTON ROAD, NEAR PETERSBURG, April 2, 1865-4.40.

Colonel T. S. BOWERS,

City Point:

We are now up, and have a continuous line of troops, and in a few hours will be intrenched from the Appomattox, below Petersburg, to the river above. Heth's and Wilcox's division-such part of them as were not captured-were cut off from town, either designedly on their part or because they could not help it. Sheridan, with the cavalry and Fifth Corps, is above them. Miles' division, Second Corps, was sent from the White Oak road to Sutherland's Station, on the South Side Railroad, where he met them, and at last accounts was engaged with them. Not knowing whether Sheridan would get up in time General Humphreys was sent with another division from here. The whole captures since the army started out gunning will not amount to less than 12,000 men, and probably 50 pieces of artillery. I do not know the number of men, and guns accurately, however. A portion of General Foster's division, Twenty-fourth Corps, made one of the most gallant charges and captured a very important fort from the enemy, with its entire garrison. All seems well with us, and everything quiet just now. I think the President might come out and pay us a visit to-morrow.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Allow me to tender to you and all with you the nation's grateful thanks for this additional and magnificent success. At your kind suggestion I think I will meet you to-morrow.

A. LINCOLN.
