His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS,

President Confederate States:

Mr. PRESIDENT: My attention has been much given to the organization of the cavalry of this army during the present campaign. I believe I submitter do Your Excellency some of my views on this subject last spring.

I think the brigades, as now composed, even with the reduced numbers in the regiments, are too large for one commander. Three regiments, if full, would be as much as one commander could properly attend to either in camp, on the march, or in battle. But our regiments, unfortunately, are not full, and I therefore propose four regiments to a brigade. I think by reducing the number of regiments in a brigade we shall get more men into the field. The brigade commander having fewer men can pay more attention to each, and I think the number of absentees from the regiments will thus be reduced.
