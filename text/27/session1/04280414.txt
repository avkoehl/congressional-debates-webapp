violation of the Constitution, iha* venerated instru-
ment des gned for the security o{ oar rights and
liberty—>n alarn.mg attemot to exercise power
for Which there is no laivful warrant—'hpse can-
not be too indignantly rebuked, or two harshly de-
nounced by tiiose who are yet free and understand
th«ir rights, ?nd who are firmly determined to pre-
serve their freedom by a lesolute defencs of those
rights.
A brief reference to «ome of thefavorte pu'poces
and deigns of thedommar t party will show that their
charac er and tendency are not misunderstood—and
that they furnish ample justification to this meet-
ing, and to othei meetings of oir fellow-citizen.,

ccndeTinatioD, and foi the fot mal adoption of re-
solutions to cc-ooera'e ardently and persevenugly
with, all of similar mind, to resist and defeat th°m
It may be premised that, during the late political
contes , our opp< nenl«, as a patty, did not avow
and publish any general, sett'ed principles upon
which they uotdd administer the Government,
should ihey succeed to ofh.ce It is well known
that por lit ns if ihe patty, in different sections of
the country, held and defended opinions diametri-
cally contrary to tach other—sometimes tney con-
cealed their opinions—si metimss they expo ed
them but m part, and not always m a fair and
candid manner—sometime  they pu-sued Ihe p an
of making general, vague, but bitter attacks upon
the then Admim>tration Sometimes they em-
ployed themselves m uttering ihe most virulent
personal abuse of some its prominent supporieis
At all ume*, however, all per ions of the party pre-
mised reform and retrenehm°nt, more rigid eeom -
my in the disbursement of ihe publ c money, more
sinct accountability in public oíhcu , mire jealou
legard tor the nation's r ghts and hcnot,'ard a
general improvement in the adminu'ral on o' tie
Government Wi h various and contradie'ery
opmions held by different members of the party in
different places and under diffeient circumstances,
with vague and indefinite promises of reform, with
a formal determination not to avow and publish any
fixed principlc-s or agreed policy which re"e.ved
the general comurrence—it w>s imp^Sjb e to
cause the eltcti n to tarn upon a fair con'tv of
principle, it was impiactioable to make up and de-
cide, by the result of the elect on, my dist ret -
sass.
But now the promises oí ihe pan   re to be te> ed
by the performances oí die pre ent time    Tae«H] l-

Althougn it has been a, vexed question since the
adoption of the Federal Constitution—although
much has bsen ably wutten and argued on  both
sides—although itissurrounded with Congressional,
Judicial, Executive, and popular decisions—jet this
meeting will consider ioi ltvli whether the Con-
si ution has conferred on Consre s tie power to
incorporate a United States Bank, and whether the
incorporation oi such a Bank is, in true meaning
and g od faith, the making of a law, which is
bo h necessary anl proper for carrying into execu-
tion any of the enjmerated powen. given lo Con-
gress, oran/ po ver vested by th Constitution in

frus'ra'ed by the iwitly ¿nd commendable inter-

effort.—'iy confession compromising m their prirci-
ples—the apprehension cannot be altogether dis-
missed that there will be renewed attempts to ac-
complish their designs What secret spring may
be applied to the motives and actions of men—
what magical influence may be spread over ihe
mind by the cunning and dexterous use, or by ihe
studiou-s and designing omission of paiticular
woids and pbrates—by the ariful employ neat and
application of the terms assent and dissent—by
trivial alterations in the de ails of tl e plan—by
slight modified ion5 of furs ions—by unes-en íal
