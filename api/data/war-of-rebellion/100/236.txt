Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I have a dispatch from General Potter, commanding the expedition sent to the interior of South Carolina, dated Sumterville, April 10. * He met there a brigade of the enemy on its way to join Johnston, and routed them, capturing 3 pieces of artillery and losing but 30 men. Potter's cavalry has gone to Machester, whither he will follow, and then determine his future movements. He is moving in a part of the country not touched by General Sherman; has destroyed immense amounts of property, including bridges, railroad buildings, and rolling-stock, cotton, lumber, and Government supplies. I shall carry out all General Sherman's instructions in that quarter.

Your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.
