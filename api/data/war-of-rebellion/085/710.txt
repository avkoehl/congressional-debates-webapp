Brigadier-General SANBORN,

Commanding Forces:

GENERAL: Communication received. I had already sent yo two dispatches giving you all the information. The enemy attempted to camp to-night at the mill in my front. He was running it. I attacked him vigorously, and he abandoned it and moved west of Moreau and is encamped at Gordon's and Thomson's. His train to-night is reported by my pickets to be moving northward toward the Jefferson City and California road. Colonel Phelps' command reached here to-night and have gone into camp. The enemy's train crossed Moreau this morning above this. Where is the First Iowa Cavalry, and when will it report to me? Thurber's battery, I presume, is on your road. I need guns very much.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. PHILLIPS,

Colonel, Commanding.
