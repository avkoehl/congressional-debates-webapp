THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 18.
to leave it to regulations which we do not have a
hand in making, because there is no knowing how
extensive it may be.
1 do not know that I wish to add anything to
what 1 have said. Gentlemen liuve usked me
questions, and as I do not possess a great dual of
presence of mind \n these days, if i designed to
say anything else I have forgotten it, and prob-
ably what a man forgets is not worth saying.
Mr. CONNESS. 1 was about to suggest"that
perhaps we had better take a vote on the ques-
tion of whether the bill should be committed or
not, so that we can then go on and debate it if the
Senate refuse to recommit it. It appears to mo
we had better determine that question first.
Mr. JOHNSON. 1 suppose it is not the pur-
pose of the Senate to conclude this bill to-day.
There is a great deal of business on the table that
I think requires an executive session; and I move
that the Senate pioceed to the consideration of
executive business.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. If the honorable Senator
from Maiyland will allow me I should like to
take up a bill that will take but a few moments,
and which it is necessary should be acted on before
the Indian appropriation bill comes to us. It is
a bill in relation to Indian affairs m California. I
think it will take but a few minutes to dispose of
it; and I will ask the honorable Senator to give
way, and allow me to take up that bill, it is
Senate hill No. 80.
Mr. JOHNSON. I withdraw it.
Tiy PRESIDING OFFICE!!.. Thequestion
is on the motion to commit the bill before the Sen-
ate to the Committee on the Judiciary.
Mr. WILSON. 1 ask the Senator fVmn Mary-
land to allow me to make a motion.
The PRESIDING omCKLl. The Chair is
obliged to lemmd the Senate that then' is a ques-
tion now pending befoie the Senate, and it should
be (.TispoM'd of.
Mr. WILSON. The question is on the mo-
tion to go into executive session.
The PR KS] DING OFFICE it. That motion,
if put, will of couise dispose of the pending ques-
tion, but the Chair und'-istood th* Senator from
Maryland to withdraw that motion.
Mr. JOHNSON. L did.
Mi*. DOOLITTLE. And I make a motion to
postpoiv all prior ordi rs for the purpose of inki ni-
up the bill whieh I have indicated. It will take
but a f«-w moments, and it is necessary to act upon
it before the appi opriat ton bill eomes tn.
INDIAN AFKAIUS IN CVi,H'OK\IA.
The motion was airtoed to; and the Senate,ns in
Ouimrnttee of the Whole, proceeded to consider
the bill (S. JNo. 80) to niowde foi the bettei or-
ganization of Indian affairs in California.
Mi. DOOLITTLE. As the bill, on consulta-
tion with the honowible Senator fiom Cahfonmi
[Mr CokxfssJ who introduced it, has been con-
sidcied by the Committee on Indian AfFans and
a substitute has Leui offered by them to the en-
tire bill, if it will meet his approbation I will ask
that the substitute only bo lead. 1 do not think
it is necessary to read the whole bill.
Mr. CONN ESS. Cei tamly.
Tin* PRESIDING OFFICER. The reading
of the anginal bill will be dispensed with, if theie
be no objection, and the Secretary will read the
substitute imported by the committee.
1 lie Secretary read the amendment of the com-
mittee, to sti tke out all of the original bill after
the enacting clause, and to insert the following
in lieu thereof:

I Mr. CONNESS. I desire to offer an amend-
; mcnt to tho fuHt si ction of the amendment of the
! committc. I move, m the twentieth line of that
j section, to strike out the word iifte.jn," iiod to
i insert " eighteen." As it now btands, it provides
[ a compensation for the chn 1>: of the superjniend-
i ent a snluiy of ^>1,500 per annum. It will l)o re-
mensbet'd fhat tins bill ptopuses economy m the
■ Indian ali-urs of Cuhlorma. "We have now two
l' ^upenntcnehuicics in that State, \v nh all then ma-
ll chinery. This lull proposes om*, and one only,
]i for tiie entire SL<«■; nnd T may a.s well Pay here
|! thu up t(> tlu^ time, as el^-^when1, poihups, the !
j; Indian affuiis of California ha\e not been a a wej] j
nnubig. d as they should be. it is my desire and ]
ji disposition in whatever I shail have to do,either j
[j in recommending oiKcus or afterwards m oiiserv- ;
ji m  how they executc then duties, to sec to it that i
h there shall bv' improvement lierealter. j
'■ The on.: sujitrmtendent now proposed is to in- '
i' dude the enUre State, a State n thousand miles m I
ii CXe
of woik to do. He will have necessarily tn travel
and visit the reservations. There can be no busi-
ness of that kind correctly conducted without
watchfulness on the partofhim who superintends
it. The provision here to pay the clerk of the
superintendent $1,500 a year, which, it will be re-
membeiedjis to be paid in legal-tender notes, now
at a discount of forty ccnts on the dollar, is a very
slender provision. That clerk will have to be equal
to the superintendent^ his ability to perfoim the
"business of the office. The change I suggest is
$1,800 in place of §1,500, which will still make it
a very small salary. I hope that will be done,
and I move the amendment.
Mr. WILKINSON. I hope that amendment
will not be adopted. 1 have no particular feeling
about it, but 1 think the committee, in fixing
§1,500, which is considerably more than the clerks
of the MipenntundcHts in other parts of the coun-
try receive 
Mr. CONNESS. Will you not make any al-
lowance for the increased cost of living with us?
Mr. WILKINSON. We have made some al-
lowance. We luivc advanced this salary some
thiee or four hundred dollarsmote than any other
clerk to a superintendent in the United States re-
ceives. 1 think that is adequate to even the ad-
ditional expense of living in California over the
other parts of the country.
Mr. CONNESS. I will not discuss this amend-
ment. I did not think there would be an objec-
tion to it. The'Senator does not seem to take into
consideration that money m the West is not money
in the extreme West; that the legal-tender notes
in which this officer is to be paid, as well as all
our officers in that State, now are at a reduction
of forty cents on the dollar. I do not desire and
I have introduced no bill here to provide for mak-
i mg up that loss to our officers. Itis the incidental
result of the relation of war. 1 only ask to have
it m tins case partially done. The salaiy of the
officer, tf this increase be madre, will be about twelve
hundred dollars in the currency of the State.
Mr. JOHNSON. I waived the motion which
I made to proceed to the consideration of execu-
tive business under the belief that this bill would
pass without debate. I move now that the bill be
laid on the table, and that we proceed to the con-
sideration ofexecutive business.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. If the honorable Senator
will move to go into executive session without
moving to lay the bill on the table, it will come
up as unfinished business on Monday morning,
and then w1 can dispose of it.
Mi. CONNESS. I suggest to the honorable
Senator from Maryland that this is the only
amendment that I propose to offer, and I do not
think there will be any fuither discussion.
Mi. DOOLITTLE. I suggest to the honorable
Senator from California that there are gentlemen
who desire to base a brief statement of what the
ehunger produced by this bill are, and we shall
save time if we let it pass over until Monday
Moniiiiic.
Mr. CONNESS. All right.
EXKCUTTYK FESSTON.
Mr. JOHNSON. I move then that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of executive business.
The motion was agreed to; and after some time
spent in the consideration of executive business,
the doors were reopened* and the Sena te adjourned -
