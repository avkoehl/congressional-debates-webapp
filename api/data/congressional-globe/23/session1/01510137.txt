Bink of the Un ted S ates has chosen to assume
towards the Giveinment and the State banks is a
false position I most cheerfu'l/ admit, but that

ter of the bank That, for these constitutional and
legal acts, it has pleased the bank to wreak its ven-
geance upon the community, 1 neither allege nor
behev e that the State banks hav e made the slight-
est hostile movement against it, neither is nor can
be ptetendcj VVnat, then, is the motive for this
rapid curtailment > I have not the slightest doubt,
Mr 1'resident, that, in the language of the resolu-
tions X ho d in my hand, it is to be found, and
found only, in an attempt of the bank, " at a time
' of geneial prosperity, to produce pecuniary dis
' tress and alarm, and in exercising its poivei with
' a view to extort a renewal of its charter from the
1 fears of the people " So much for the pressure,
and the causes of it
I will now consider the remedy for the evil which
the Senator proposes Leaving the discussion of
e/erythingconstitutional, political, and exped «nt,
the Senatoi, with his usual tact, goes directly to
tnemattet m hand, and with the utmost confidence
he tells us that the remedy is rot to befound in the
res'oratio i of the deposites, bat in the rechartei of
the present uank Whatever else may be said of
this avowal, it must, at least, be admt'ted that it
discredit to the candor of the Senator For my-
self, I thank him, and the country will thank him
aiso It is tim , Mr Piesident, high time, that
'hings should be called by the r right names m
relation to the depending controversy, that the veil
with wh>ch it has hitherto been attempted to dis
guise the subject should be torn off, and that the
people should know what is the question which
is, in fact, occupying the atten'ion of Congress
This being done by the declaiation of the S nate,
theie is reason to hope that we may heieaftei be,
if we have not heretofore been, aided by contubu
tions of public sentiment, so fer as the Senate may
th nk proper to allow lrfiuences of that sort to
enter into its deliberations And,~n, I venture the
I rediotion that if the expresión1, now iiram our
ueSjOrtho e whicn bl all heieafte be placed there,
as evidence^ of public sentime it, shall be examined,
it will t ipeai that the good sense and ingenuity of
the Senator, in devising this íemely, has oily
p' iced 1 nn on a level witn the common opinion
of the whole community, as to the real question in
dispute that every paoer favonng the views of the
opponen s of the Administration, has ard will,
expie«sly or impliedly, recogn ze the fact that the
ques ion jtfoie ne public is, " Bank, or no bank,"
and that the real issue has that direction—not the
disposition of the Government deposites A peti
Hon for íecharter is a mere mat'er of form which
can at anytime Le brought forward A few days,
or even a few hours, are sufficient for that object,
ard we ougut not to permit ouiselves to doubt that
such a petnion will be forthcoming or not, accord-
ing to the decision of this meiely incidental ques
tion,now made to assume the placeand importance
of the real issue
Bat, Mi President, while I highly approve of
t e opcn and manly ground taken by the Senator
from Massachusetts, I differ witn him tolo roio as
to 'i e lemedy ne proposes Tliere is no n duee
ments which cm prevail upon me to vote for the
lech ttei of tne Banii of the United Sta'es I
would oppose tms ban-k upon tie ground of ¡ts
flagiant \ olationsof the high trusts confided to it,
but i ly o jec ions are of a deeper and graver char
aUer I go agamst this bank, and af-mst any
and ev ry bank to be incorporated by Congress,
whetner to be located at Philadelphia, or New
Yoric, or anywnere else within the twenty four
indenendent States which compose this ConfeJ
ency, upon the broad giound winch adnits not of
commomisc, that Congiess has not the power, by
the Constitution, to incoiporate such a bark
I may be ovei sanguine, Mi Piesident, but 1
i'o most fii mly believe that, 11 a luition to tne m-
va'u tole s°iv ces already lendeitd to his country
by tie Pies, den'of the United S ates, he is, unt'ei
Pi nielen" , des'ineJ still to render her a gieatei

the Constuut on of the country to what it was in-
tende 1 to be 1 y those who formed it, and to wiat
it wasundeistood to be by the people who adopted
it In re evng tnat sacied instrument from those

itself in open array against, and to attempt to over-
rule, the Government of the country I believe
the high destiny is yet in store for that venerable
man of disproving the exalted compliment ¡ong
since paid him by the great apostle of republican-
ism, "that hehadaheady filled the measure of his
country'sglory," and that he isyet to accomplish
what neither Thomas Jefferson nor his illustrious
successor could accomplish, by adding to the proof
which he has so largely contributed to afford, that
his country is invincible by arms, the consolatory
fact that there is at least one spot upon earth
where written constitutions are rigidly regarded.
I know, sir, that this work which the President
has undertaken, and upon the success of which he
has, with his usual moral courage, staked the hard-
earned fiuits of a glorious life, is full of difficulty.
I know well that it will put the fortitude and pa-
triotism of his countrymen to the severest test, but
1 am happy also to know that he has, in this in-
stance, as heretofore, put himself upon the forti-
tude and pan lotism ot a people who have never yet
failed him, or any man who was himself faithful
to his country m the hour of peril
Of the course which the Suite which I have the
honor in part to íepreeent here will take in this
great contest, it becomes me, forming so humble a
part of its voice in the councils of the nation, and
known only by the favors I have received at its
hands, to speak with great diffidence In the res-
olutions 1 now lay before the Senate, it has spoken
for itself upon most of the points involved As to
the otheis I feel that my knowledge of theüiarac-
ter of its people, and of the known sentiments of
whole masses of its public men, will justify me in
the confident expression of an opinion that the
Slate will sustain the Executive to the utmost m
this controversy, and that I may say to those who
aie, and long have been, desiious to restore the
Constitution, m this regaid,to its true reading,
1 now'sthe day and novv's the hour" for its ac-
complishment At all events I have the right to
say trat 1 will place myself by the side of the
Piesident to the full extent of the views 1 have
I given, and that I desne to stand or fall with my
constituents as they shall deteimme the result
I have thus responded, ard I hope the Senator
I from ¡Massachusetts will allow fully, to so much
of his appeal I will go on, sir, and cover the
| whole ground He has asked, if you will neither
recharter the present bank nor es'ablish a rew
one, what will you do? As an individual, sir, and
speaking for myself only, I say I will sustain the
executive branch of the Govei nment by all the
legal means in my power, in the effort now making
to substitute the State banks instead of the Bank
of the United States as the fiscal agent of the Gov-
ernment I believe they tie fully competent to
the object I am wholly unmoved by the alarms
which have been sounded, either as to their inse-
curity, or influence, or any other danger to be
apprehended from their employment I hold the
steps so far taken in funheianceof this ob]ect well
warranted bytheConstitutionand lawsoftheland,
and I believe that the honor and best mteiests of
tie country imperiously require that they should
be fully sustained by the people and by their rep-
resentatives here
That these views are correct, it is not, of course,
my intention, at this time, to attempt to show in
some stage of the debate upon this great subject,
I hope to be able, without trespassing upon the
superior c'aims of others, to have that opportu-
nity
We have been told, and told emphatically, that
things cannot remain as they are, that the powers
now vested m and exetcised by the Secretary of
tie Tieasury aie too broad, and that legislative
aid is required If I have not misunderstood the
imooit of lemarks, it has also been told to us that
such aid will be withheld 1 o th s I for the pres-
ent only answei that things are now, in this le-
«iDect, precisely as thev wei e be'bre the incorpora-
tion ot the piesent bank, that tne same poweis
which tie Seci etary of the Treasury then had he
has still, that by tie change of the deposites ftom
the Bank of the United States, the executive de-
partment of the Government has been restored
to the control over the places for the bafe keep-
ing of tne public moneys which it had by law
be ore these moneys were deposited with that m-
s uu ion, ail that all the law formerly existirg
