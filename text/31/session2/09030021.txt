Department, a proper subject for distinct appro- \
priations, and I have therefore submitted estimates '
for that service upon a basis of twenty revenue
vessels—a less number by four than existed pre*
vious to tk&t reduction.
PUBLIC DEBT.
According to the last annual report from this
Department, the public debt on the 1st December,
1849, including $18,821 48 in Treasury notes and
stock not then stated, was #64,723,515 16
Since that period the following reductions have
been made, viz:
On account of the debt of the cities of the District of
Columbia, assumed by the act of 20th May,
1836  $60,000 00
On Recount of the old funded and unfunded
debt  3,149 19
Of Treasury notes    1,877 67 ,
And of the stock of 1847   430,250 00 j
$495,376 79 !
The above stock *ras purchased at market rates, 1
It will be seen that, for the three years prior to the war,
the aggregate expenditures, exclusive of trust funds, pub-
lic debt, and the expenses of collecting the revenue from
customs, lands, &c.,were $63,833,704 93
Averaging annually $21,277,901 64
For th^ three years of the war 135,901,017 31
Averaging... 41,733,672 37
And for the three years immediately subse-
quent thereto 116,929,178 89
Averaging annually 38,974,059 61
Including the expenses of collecting the rev-
enue from customs, public lands, duties re-
turned, drawbacks, debentures, bounties,
&c., none of which have appeared in the
expenditures heretofore exhibited prior to
the 30th June, 1849, (as all these items
were, previously to that date, deducted from
the revenue before the latter was paid into
the Treasury, leaving only the net receipts
to figure in the annual statements,) the ag-
gregate expenditures for the fi*st period (per
statement H) will be seen to have been... 70,230,541 83
Averaging 25,410,180 61
For the second period 137,189,666 97
Averaging 45,729,888 99
And for the third period 194,106,755 18
Averaging 41,702,251 39
And for objects not included in the sum as the
expenditures for 1845, made in pursuance
of acts of the Government during a period
subsequent to 3d March, 1845, and prior to
4th March, 1849, including Post Office de-
ficiencies and census, as follows, (see state-
ment O :)
Seventh census  1,276,000 00
Erection of Patent Office  600,000 00
Supplying deficiencies in Post Office Depart-
ment, and for Department mail matter  1,768,752 57
Expenses of collecting the revenue from cus-
toms, lands, &c., never exhibited in the
expenditures prior to 30th June. 1849  6,813,557 95

stitution  412,134 70
Refunding duties, debentures, drawbacks,
bounties, fcc  , 2,923,166 36

the accruing revenue  101,999 50

its agents, would have been somewhat increased.
The public debt on the 30th November last was
$64,228,238 37, as per statement D, viz:

a statement (E) showing the issue, reissue, and
redemption of Treasury notes.
Statement annexed (marked F) shows the
amount of Treasury notes paid during the last

ESTIMATES.
The total actual eath receipts into the Treasury from all
sources during the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1850,
were $43,774,848 90
Tbe total cash expenditures for the same pe-
riod were 39,355,268 69
Tbe actual and estimated cash receipts from
aH sources for the year ending 30th June, 1
1851,". are 47,592,000 00

for the same period amount to 53,737,547 50
Tbe total estimated cash receipts for the year
ending 30th June, 1852, amount to 46,800,000 00
The total estimated cash expenditures for the
same period amount to (see statement G). .48,124,993 18
I am well aware that these actual and estimated !
expenditures may justly be deemed large; and, •
therefore, in submitting them, it is proper that i
required for an indefinite period.
Annexed are statements (I and J) showing the
total annual expenditures, exclusive of the pay-
ments on account of the public debt, as made and
estimated to be made under the direction of the
several heads of Departments for the years ending
30th June, 1846-'47,-'48,-'49,-50,-'51, and '52,
or the seven years subsequent to the declaration
of war with Mexico. Also statement (K) show-
ing the quantities and values of the public lands
required to satisfy warrants issued, and to be
issued, under the several acts granting lands, dis-
tinguishing, of such expenditures and values, those ________
occasioned by said war from those demanded by j This does not include many claims presented

the war with Mexico, having been $21,380,-

seven succeeding years upon that basis
would have amounted to 149,660,345 52
Showing an excess over the peace establish- j!
ment of 1845 of. 145,147,062 43
This excess of expenditures is to be accounted j
fof as follows:
The actual and estimated expenditures of the War Depart- |
ment for seven years subsequent to the declaration of the j!
war with Mexico, are $117,876,495 31
Under peace establishment of 1845, as before
stated, they would have been  35,643,749 54 j
Excess occasioned by said war  82,232,745 77

Navy Department amount to..$62,659,331 74

ment! 43,600,47363 !

The expenditures for the four succeeding years, from 1841
to 1845, are averaged in consequence of the change in the
fiscal year, the average being #22,987,411 78
A diminution in the average, as compared
with the four preceding years, of.  3,481,158 95
Amounting in the aggregate to  13,924,635 80
The estimated expenditures for the year end-
ing 30th June, 1852, are 48,124,993 18
The expenditure under the peace establish-
ment of 1845, exclusive of the public debt,
were   21,380,049 36
Excess for the year ending 30th June, 1852.. 26,744,943 83
