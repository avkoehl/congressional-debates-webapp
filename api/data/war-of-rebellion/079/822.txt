leaving the Eighth Tennessee, 1,000 or 1,200 strong, Ninth, about 450, and the Thirteenth (strength not know), and Kirk at the gap or vicinity. Citizens report no troops at Morrisontown or Mosby Creek; some of our scouts report 100 at the latter point. I learned that the train for the last few days brought down from the gap some soldiers, probably the Ohio troops. I could learn nothing of artillery passing down. Heard nothing of state of affairs at Strawberry Plains.

Very respectfully,

JOHN TOLAND,

Lieutenant, &amp;c.
HEADQUARTERS,Nine miles south of La Fayette, October 16, 1864.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Commanding, &c.:

Your letter of the 13th just received. Upon leaving Palmetto, on the WEST Point railroad, I sent orders to Brigadier General Daniel W. Adams to take post at Jacksonville to superintend matters there and see that men and supplies were forwarded to this army. I supposed he was already there. An engineer officer has been ordered at once to Jacksonville in accordance with your suggestion.

J. B. HOOD,

General.
HEADQUARTERS,Nine miles south of La Fayette, October 16, 1864.

Major General ARNOLD ELZEY:

General Jackson has been ordered to strike the railroad between the Etowah and Chattahoochee, and should it be necessary for the protection of our trains moving from Jacksonville to Edward's Ferry you must place Stovall's brigade in the vicinity of Cave Spring, with a battery. The present position of the army will protect Round Mountain from any movement of the enemy on the north side of the Coosa.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

(For General Hood.)
HEADQUARTERS,Nine miles south of La Fayette, October 16, 1864.

Major General ARNOLD ELZEY,

Commanding, &c.:

Your dispatch, dated nine miles from Jacksonville, 8 p. m., October 14, 1864, received. General Hood directs that you send all the infantrymen belonging to this army (except Stovall's brigade) to join the army via Edward's Ferry and Summerville, and if you have taken up the pontoon bridge at Edward's Ferry have it returned there and parked on this side. A pontoon train has been ordered from the army to march to Edward's Ferry without delay, to be laid there.

A. P. MASON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
