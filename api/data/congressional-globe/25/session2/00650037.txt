CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
States can only be maintained bv abstaining from
ail interference with the law?, domestic policy, and
peculiar interests of every other Stat/", the conduct
of those who would coerce our iellow citizens m
other States into abolition of slavery, by inflamma-
tory appeals addressed to the fears of the masters
and the passion  of the slaves, is in the lushest
degree censurable, as tending to allenate one por-
tion of our counliymen fiom another, and tu
introduce discord into our sister States, and as a
violation of that spirit of compromise m which the
Constitution was framed, and a due observance of
which is necessary to the safety of the Union  '
The first resolution was adopted with great
unanimity, and ti e second by a vote of one hundí ed
and twenty-four to twenty one And he verily be-
lieved that the result of the vote upon those r^so'u
tions was a fair index; of popular op tnon in that
State as to the power of Congress over the "ubject
of slaverv generally, and particula-ly upon toe
subject of slavery in the Disltiet of Columbia
«Wording to the sentiment of New Hampshire, it
would be a violation of the public f utn to abo ish
slavery m the District of Columbia, unless upon
the request of the citizens oi this District, and of
the States by whom this District was ceded to the
General Government He full} concurred in this
opinion, and until there shall be such a lequest
fiom this District, and from the States of Virginia
and Maryland, communicated to Congress, any
action upon the subject of abolishing slavery in this
District would be founded in manifest injustice
Mr NILES, m explanation of his former re-
marks, said he did not approve of ciooked courses
The gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr Hub-
bard) says that the peUtion is befoie us if we Uv
it on the table, and that so far, it is received, and
yet he say= that, bj la} ing it on the table, the peti-
tion is rejected He (Mr N) could not recoioile
this contradiction lit wishe 1 the ,> tuioi to be re-
ceived, and he wou'd like D have a gi oil and
wholesome report from a committee of the Senate
made upon it
Mr. RIVES replied to the argument, that ieceiv-
mg the petition, and having a report made, would
quiet the e\cttemenl Not so this had been
already done two years ago Then, in the other
House, a select committee, composed chiefly of
northern men, had presented an elaborate repoit,
and this had been so far *rom allaying the excite-
ment, that now gentlemen come forward and tell
us that the excitement is increased, therefore, it
would be ptrfccily nug-'uri to qo round the same
circle again To him (VIr It) it appeaiid thit
the most pacificatory course to be pursued was to
act as hitherto, and to lay the raotnn to receive
upon the table This course he bad ret unmended
on a former occasion, an t he still adhered ti that
opinion Mr R repelled tie idol that this couise
involved a violation of the right of petitioning It
appeared to him that tne petitioners wou'd never be
satisfied until they got a repoit in their favor He
should, therefore, move again to 11\ on the table,in
hopes of silencing for e.er this ceaseless clamor

It was no foiced conchwin, but the dictate of
common sense, that pe"severance m the same

But there was another poin , on which Mr C
wou'd touch with perfect ca]mnes^ Mr C would

tor trom Geirgia, it  th" °"nate, b\   ,ie-si>ling in
their past course, could pr'di-et e same ca'mness
in the countiv which it had u me  among them-
selves    Bat it was much more important tl at the
couniiy shou'J be quiet than the Senate    Mr C     ]
had asked whether the excitement had been in-    I
created,  and by what causes, with  the view to    I
ascertain if any thing could be done by the Senate
to  al'ay ihe excitement,   and render  the people    >.
quiet and happy    The reply was, that the excite-
ment was extending, and chiefly by the impression    ;
that the great r publican right of petition had been
assailed, which the petitioners chose to assert, by
acting w ith those with whom they really had no
s} mpilh}     Mr C preferred that the two classes    j
of petitioners should be separated, to deprive the
abolitionists of the advantage of mixing their pecu*    '
liar objects with other matters
The petitions, Mr C said, were first to be re-
ceived , but was this all? Was not thm undei-
stood >o imp'y deliberation on the question ? The
co d, «imple act of reception, followed by an in-
stant rejection, amounted to not receiving, and
trust give color to the charge that it is a substan-
tial de ual of thought of petition. It had been said
that this was not a case for argument Not a case
for argument1 What was it that lay at the very
bottom of all our free institutions'! Argument,
mquirv, reasoning, consideration, deliberation. We
were a reasoning people, and it was our greatest
boast that we possessed reasoning powers capable
of comprehending the various subjects relating to a
free Government Mr. C thought the best course
w as to receive these petitions, and refer them to
the Commute for the District, to act on them as
they pleased and if the country should not then
be qu et, let them make a report, embodying with
the argument the various facts relating to the sub-
ject, seveial of which Mr. C enumerated The
consequence of this would be, that those who were
described as fanatics would be separated from those
w ho bel ev e 1 that the right of petition had been
as>ail i' The Senatoi from Virginia (Ml. Rivls)
hi I sipt (' Ihit th s course had been liken in 'he-
other House But let it be taken I) both Houses
of Congress
Mr GRUNDY expressed his regret at the views
of the Senator from  Kentucky.   For two years
past the Senate had pursued the course of laying
the questions relating to these petitions on the table.
During that time there had been little or no discus-   t
sion in that bodj , and  it was the discussion in
Congress that was doing more mischief on the sub-
ject than any thing else     If the coming in of the
petitions was to be prevented, how could it be done12
By preserving silence upon them.   Every time tho
petitioners  observed discussion in Congress, they
were encouraged to proceed , but if the Senate per-
sisted tn  the course to which they had sometime
adhered, their hopes would be cut off    But if this
course were now abandoned, they w uld say that
the Senate had been driven to change iheir ground,
aud they wo ild ionsider it as a gam on their part.    I
And could an abler report be made on the subject    '
by any committee than that by the select commit-
tee of which Mi   Pinckney was chairman?   And
had tint produced any effect?    Gentlemen said no-
the excitement was increasing    And could the
Senate produce any  effect by  a report?    No    it
would give the petitioners hope that they would    I
f nally prevail     Mi   G. would vote to receive the    j
petitions, because he questioned whether a contrary    j
vote might not abridge the right of petition     Bat    ¡
he hoped that for the sake of teaching these people    j
that this subjiet must not be interfered  with, the}     '
would be la d on the table                                          j
Mr C A.LHOÜN said he believed that the coarse
proposed by Mr Clay w as calculated the most of
all to produce an excitement If a single step was
v lelded, the lanatical spirit would be reanimated
with new excitement, and those, therefore, whoso
v elded, incurred a feaiful responsibility Mr C.
dcspaiied, as far as the Northern pa it of the coun-
trv was concerned, on,the question of abolition It
was interwoven with the political condition of the
North, in the nature and stale of parties, and it
nou'd run, aid mu<t run, m'o their struggles for
