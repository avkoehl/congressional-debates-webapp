Major CHARLOT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fort Leavenworth:

In view of the probable calling out of the militia in Douglas and Shawnee Counties, ought not subsistence to be sent to this place for their use. There are about 2,000 and there are no stores here, except for the few troops comprising the garrison. Inform me if they are to be sent.

Major-General, Commanding.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, September 22, 1864.

Major-General SYKES:

Dispatches arrived. Probably 1,000 would be all sufficient to garrison Fort Scott, and Paola or Mound City is the better point to collect a movable army. McLain's battery should go down and militia garrison Lawrence and this place. The country is so destitute of everything I do not see how Price can bring a large army through Arkansas, but spies report to Rosecrans 26,000. A small garrison at Fort Scott ought to resist Stand Watie with his three pieces of artillery and 2,000 or 3,000 irregular forces. The militia will soon turn out if we find the enemy actually coming forward and we may send forward volunteers confident of the militia substitutes.

Major-General.

Colonel C. R. JENNISON, Fort Scott:

If you need any help call upon Colonel Moonlight. General Fishback has been directed to call out the militia. Hurry them up and get a force at Fort Scott that will insure its safety. Keep watch in your rear that no force comes in without my being apprised of it.
