Major-General CURTIS,

In the Field, Arkansas:

Be careful to keep your main force together and well in hand. Ascertain the enemy's movements by throwing out cavalry. Be careful of Van Dorn. He is a vigilant and energetic officer, and will be certain to strike any exposed point. Keep me well advised of the enemy's movements, as I must be prepared for him on other points. This is important.
