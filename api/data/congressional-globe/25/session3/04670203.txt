Interference in Elections—Mr. Buchanan.
Senate.
that have taken this ground Some gentlemen
fiom the old States, as eminent for their standing
as their acknowledged abilities and talents, have
taken and advocated the same doctunes, and I
am proud of the opportunity of bunging to my
aid the names of such men as Tazewell and John
Tayloi of Caroline, who have afforded to the
world a practical illustration of then sincenty in
the State-lights doctrine, by openly avowing and
advocating the doctrines I speak of
Now, sir, I feel no hesitation in saying, if I
had not the long established prejudices of the
House and ot the country to contend against, if
it were not foi the sacia aun fames, the \rcursed
thirst foi gold, whose rapacious spmt is devoui-
lng and swallowing up all that is pure and holy
in the great and fundamental pnnciples of oui
Government, I should confidently expect to íeach
then convictions, and to break forever the power
of that incubus which has been so long piessing
down upon our bosoms, stifling our bieath, ic~
piessing our eneigies, paralyzing oui efforts, and
blasting all oui hopes 1 should expect to see
us very soon occupying that position of equality
among the States of this Confederacy, which is
us bioad foundation, and upon which the whole
stiucture is erected, entire in its form, and peifect
in all its parts Tell me why it is that you see
every State leprcsented equally in the Senate of
the United States, but upon the beautiful and
sublime idea that equality in lights, equality in
powei, equality in soveieignty, is the all pervad-
ing and life giving principle of this Confeder-
acy'
Sir, let me say to you, if you would consult
your own mteiests—if you would look to the
gieat cause of human adv incement, and to the
onward ptinciples of genuine hbuty—if you
would steadfistly fix your eye upon the Hue
causes of a nation's glorv—upon those elastic
spungs in the action and conduct of man, which,
like the little rivulets that bmst fiom the mount
tain's side, and move on their placid couise to
swell the volume of the mighty uver, contubute
to enlarge the circle of the power, the wealth, and
the gieatness of a people, you would at once re
least your grasp, and draw out fiom oui sides
the iron claws which have been so long fastened
in our vitals
Let me beg you to look at and examine the
document I hold in my hands Heie is that
which tells a nation's powei, and speaks a peo
pie's wealth It contains estimates of the ev
poits and imports of New Oileans and Mobile,
which the Secietaiyot the Trtasuiy was kind
enough to furnish me upon an application I made
to him foi the purpose of ustng it on this occa
sion It speaks a langu tge moie eloquent and
more forcible than any I cm employ It points
out to you in lttttis of li,dit youi tiu ] olicj
CoNsideimg how we have been ciamped and op
piessed by your couise towaids us, the ftcts
which it conveys can scatcely be ciedited I
will give the aggregate, without weaiy ng \our
patience with the details The aggiegdte of the
gross amount of duties secuied in the distnct of
New Orleans fiom the 31st of Dccemhei, 1801,
to the close of the year lb37,is $,35,093,%5 81
At Mobile, $,1,332,143 90 The aggregate amount
of exports from New Oileans, from the 1st jf
Octobei, 1820, to the 1st of September, 1837—a
period of about seventeen yeais—is ¡jQ90,1GO,409,
and the amount of imports foi the same length of
time is ^138,331,357 I" the district of Mobile
the exports are stated to be $,53,508,999, and the
imports $4,460,101 Here, sir, you see the source
of our wealth, which may give you some faint
idea of our power and resouices Can a parallel
be found anywheie in the whole bounds of oui
vast countiy' ihe exports fiom NewOikans
are more than double the impoits, and fion Mo-
bile about twelve times the amount of impoits
The duties whicl acciue ftom these souices bung
you moie clear revenue than the millions of the
jubhc lands you have sold
If, undei the peci h u circumstances of embar-
rassment and oppitsMon winch much the larger
pomo i of the gieat vallev of the Mississippi has
laboicd undei, we cm exhibit to you such proud
lesults, let me ask you to consider what we wot Id
i^ave been, what you would have beep had we
been placed undei different circumstances, with
more lat.tude for exertion, more freedom for en-
terprise > But w ith the power which you claim,
and which you have so persevenngly exeicised,
of unlimited authority over the public lands with-
in the limits of the States, you have with it un-
limited authoi lty over our wealth, prosperity, and
happiness We are ciamped, ftt'ered by the
stiong- aim of inexorable powei, whose shackles
we cannot break You have locked up our re-
souices by reseivations, and denied to us the
very gifts "and bounties of Heaven by the ngor
of your system You have even denied to us
the salt of the earth, by reserving from sale the
silme lands and salt springs, and heimetically
closed in the bowels of the earth the untold and
incalculable wealth which Iks embossed in its
depths Nay, moie, instead of di?posin% of the
lands according to the expiess terms of the deeds
of cession, you ha%e withheld them from sale,
expecting an enhancement in then value by our
industry and labor, and thus in another respect
violated an obligation and disregarded a plighted
faith which had their birth with the deeds of
cession And instead of disposing of the lands,
as you should have done, accoiding to the com-
pact, you descended to the low and contempti-
ble business of leasing your lands, thus cieating
a system of landlord and tenant—a state of igno
minious dependence between the Government and
the citizens of the countiy, wholly incompatible
with the gt mus, the spmt, and the pnnciples of
the Government Give it up Abandon it for-
ever Raise us up from that state of colonial
degiadation, delivei us fiom that condition of
humiliating vassalage in which the exeicise of
unfeeling powei has so long kept us Assume
foi once in the history of the country youi own
pioud and elevated position, m exercising only
such legitimate giants of power as were ex
piessly given you, and thus fulfill the high des
times which the holy enthusiasm of the conse-
crated fatheis of the countiy expected of you
All that we ask is, to be equal with the other
States of this Confederacy in fieedom,soveieign
ty, and independence     Grant us only this, and
you will see this whole country, like the giant
thatgatheied  strength  in his wicstle with Her-
cules every time he touched the earth, spungup,
with an elastic bound, to new \igoi  and powei,
and the proud galaxy that adonis j oui stais and
yom   stupes  shine  foith with   a  rich   splendor
which nothing but ngeneiatcd hleity can give
Enable us to make our loads and canals, to cany
on oui woiks of internal impiovemonts, to man
age oui own internal police, as oui  genius and
necessities may require, and you will soon wit
ness the wondeiful change which he uncontioiled
and pi isttc p iwoi of self go/einim ¡it can alone

to cast aside your prejudi-es, to tlnow off from

lished by the law  of any of the States "    The

I     The Senator from Id ntucky, [Mr Critten-
den,] before he commenced his rimaiks, moved
j   to amend the bill by striking fiom it the pecuniary
I   penalty and peipetual disability against these of-
j   ficéis, and substituting, in then stead, the penalty
of a removal fiom office by the Piesident, upon
I    the pioduction of eviduice satisfactoiy to him
I, that any of them hid been guilty of the offense.
II  Now, for myself, I shall not vote for this amend-
' ment I will not tike advantage of the amiable
I, weakness of my fnend fiom Kentucky, in yield-
' nig to the solicitations of others that which his
own judgment approved I will more especnlly
not give such a vote, bee m^e the pi iposed amend-
ment makes no dnng*1 in the pnnciplc of the bill.

would be a much more aggiavated oflense, dis-
suade any good Whig fiom voting foi the other
