THE CONQÜBSSIONAL OLO^m
«ff
Mr, DE GRAFF accordingly made that mo-
tion
Mr JOHNSON, of Virginia, said the commit-
tee had investigated this matter, and had come to
the conclusion that these allowances ought not
to he made He hoped the question would at
least be postponed till to morrow, as the resolu-
tion had taken him by surprise, for Mr J was
satisfied he could convince the House they ought
not to pass it
The House refused to reconsider—ayes 56,
noes 67
The House then proceeded to the orders of the
day.
NORTHERN FRONTIER
The bill making an appropriation for the pro-
tection of the northern frontier coming up on its
third reading,
Mr CAMBRELENGr moved to strike out the
words "or volunteeis," as the act authorizing
the employment of that force by the President
had expned
Mr FILLMORE suggested whether that de-
scription of force might not become indispensa-
ble, and the President misrht be authorized, by
the retention of those words, to call them out
Mi McKAY desired the adoption of the
amendment for that reason
Mi. CAMBRELENG, however, withdrew the
amendment, and the hill was passed
FLORIDA WAR.
The hill making appropriations for preventing
and suppressing Indian hostilities foi 1S39 then
came up on lis third reading
Mr BELL renewed the following amendment,
mov&d by him in committee
Toi paving the value of the hor es ind equipage of the
Tenue see and other volunteers who have it any time been
m the service of th( United States, m the Tertitory of Flor
ida, and which v\ere turned over to the Government by the
oidi r of the commanding general, or oilier commanding
omccr said vilue to be a*certa ned b> the appraisement
of said value when the volunteers entered the service,
¡tJ 2 000
And the provisions of acts approved and m force at va
nous peuods since 1813, auth iriáing payment for horses
lost hi the service of the United States by rangers militia,
and volunteers, are hereby revived and extended for two
years, from and ifter the passage of this act md, under
the action of the 1 bird Auditor shall be deemed to embrace
all cases not already satisfied, of hor es lost to their owners
in service as aforesaid, m battle or otherwise, where due
care and diltgi nee be rendered manifest on the part of the
owner, and whether, if the death or loss of rangers' horses
shall have occuncd ior want of forage, and at places when
acting in obedience to the orders of commanding officers,
for igc could not have been procured by proper diligence on
the part of the owner
Mr RUSSELL íenewed his amendment to the
amendment of Mr Bell, by adding thereto the
following
" No payment, however, shall be made for horses or other
property lost or destroyed, when the loss or destruction
shall have been occasioned by the fault or neglect of the
owner, or when, by the terms of the contract, the risk was
upon the ownerof the property And the valuation, when
hoises have been turned over to the Government, shall be
made at the time they were turned over
Mr TURNEY warmly opposed the proposi-
tion of Mi R. and supported the original amend
ment
After somp further remarks from Messrs
THOMPSON and DOWNING,
Mi. BELL accepted the first blanch of the
amendment as a modification, but the second,
he said, would have the effect of defeating the
whole
After a few further remarks from Mr CHAM-
BERS, the last branch of Mr Russell's amend-
ment was rejected
Mr GRENNELL opposed the amendment of
Mr Bell, and entieated the House to put it off
till next session, and not, thus in the daik, vote
so large a draft upon the Treasury without having
the facts or any investigation.
Mr RUSSELL demanded the yeas and nays,
but they were íefused, and the amendment was
agreed to—ayes 81, noes 61
Mr GRANTLAND renewed the amendment
submitted by him in Committee of the Whole
last night.
For refunding to the State of Georgia, for pay and sub
sistence ot the troops called into service by that State to
drive the Indians from the Okefenoke swamp, §85,223
After a few remarks m opposition to it by Mr
MASON, of Ohio,
Mr PETRIKIN demanded the previous ques-
tion on the bill
Mr. OWENS begged the gentleman to with-
draw it
Mr PETRIKIN refused
The previous question was then put and car-
ried
The bill was read the third time and passed
SUSPENSION OF JOINT RULE.
Mr CAMBRELENG asked leave to submit a
resolution to rescind the 16th joint rule of the
two Houses, which provides that no bill can be
sent from one branch to the other for concur-
rence, within the last three days of the session,
be suspended, so far as regards the above two
bills.
Objection being made,
Mr C moved a suspension of the íules, which
was agreed to, and the lesolution being before
the House,
Mr GARLAND, of Louisiana, moved to in-
clude the bill to provide for taking the sixth
census
Mr CAMBRELENG accepted this as a mod-
ification
Mr WILLIAMS, of Kentucky, moved to strike
out all limitation
Mi PICKENS protested against the adoption
of this amendment, for those who had the phys-
ical force would then pass what bills they pleased
Mr SHIELDS demanded the previous ques-
tion
The previous question was seconded, and the
resolution, as modified, was agreed to
MAINE BOUNDARY QUESTION.
Mr HOWARD, on have, fiom the Committee
on Foreign Affans, íepoited a bill giving to the
President of the United States additional powers
for the defense of the United States, in certain
cases, against invasion, and for other purposes,
whioh «as read twice
The bill was accompanied bv a report, which,
upon the call of Mi LEGARE, was read as fol-
lows
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, to which have been
relerred two messages from the President of the United
States, inclosing sundry papers relating to the disturbances
upon the Aroostook river, in the bute of Maine report
That they have examined the papers submitted to them
by the House with great care, and w ill offer such reflections
upon them as the limited time for the preparation of this
report will admit    The very near approach of the termina
Hon of the present Congress, and the desire of the commit
tee that as much time as possible should be afforded to the
House for the examination ot the bill herewith reported,
are considerations of such a powerful nature that some in
cidental matters connected with the subject cannot be fully
investigated     The mam points  however  of the contro
versy, are not numerous, and upon them the opinion of the
committee is clear and decided    The position assumed by
the Pie«ident in his message is eorreet, and ought to be
sustained, if necessary, by the legislative power of Con
gress
It is well known that an informal arrangement or under
standing has existed, lor many year  past   between  the
United Statí s and Great Britain, relating to the territory in
dispute between them, and having for its object the avoid
anee of clashing authoimes  calculated to endanger the
peace of the two nation     The committee have not time
to give a detailed and historical statement of the origin and
progress of this arrangement  the examination of which
might perhaps elucidate the cause of the strange error into
which the British Government is represen  d by its agents
in this country to have fallen with respecttoitsprovisions
Suffice it to say, that it nevei appears to have gone further,
m its greatest extent, than to adopt the basis of the * uti
possidetis " leavmgeaeh party to the continued exrreise of
the jurisdiction which it hid previously maintained m prac
lice    The idea which is occasionally suggested m some of
the British documents, that, prior to the peace of 1783, the
Government of Great Britain was in possession of the whole
country, and, therefore, that this constructive possession
must be considered as continuing until she is divested of it
with her own consent is one which the United States can
never sanction, or even listen to, without strong repug
nance     It implies that the people of the United States
hold their country by a grant from the British Crown, made
in the treaty of 1783—a doctrine which was sueee sfully
resisted by the Mini ters of the United States, even when
it was advanced by remote implication, prior to the signa
ture of that treaty, by their refu mg to treat with the lint
islx ministers unul their credentials were changed    At a
subsequent period of our history, the same doctrine was
advanced m argument, and at that period, also, was, as it
musí ever be met with instant contradiction    The people
of the United States hold their country by virtue of the
declaration of the 4th Julv, 1776, and the treaty ol 1783 did
nothing more than arrange the boundary lines between the
two nations independent of each other in factand m right
So far, therefore, as the claim of Great Britain to the juris
diction over the unsettled parts of Mame is founded upon j
the twice exploded theory that she u> the rightful sovereign
of all tlut she has not granted away it cannot be submitted
to without sacrifices ot honor, which the American nation I
never will make                                                               j
When the discussion became active between the two i
Govemjnents, as to their respective rights to the territory I
now iq dispute, the greater piwt-of iMvas, attd mdeed still
remains, uninhabited by perBjaaent settlers, here an*
there a smau settlement could be found, cottsettmguisoaie
cases of a single bou- e, and in others of mote than one,
placed near each other for the convenience of the inhabit-
ants The extent of the arrangement between the two
Governments does not appear, a  construed by the Amer-
ican Government, to have gone further that  the recogni-
tion of the jurisdiction of each over the people and lauds
then operated upon by tt If these inhabitants hadtaken
out tho titles to their lands from either one Governmental;
the other, and were ra the habit of resorung to us jtidieml
authority for Die preservation of order, then they were to
continue so to do until the question of ultimate ownership
should be finally decided in some mode satisfactory to both
Governments The propriety of this arrangemeni will not
be questioned by the committee If it left to the Bluish
Government the jurisdiction over the inhabitants along the
military road which leads from Halifax to Cluehee, anil
thereby furnishid it with a motive for procrastinating the
controversy, inasmuch as it continued m the enjoyment of
nearly all that rendered the country valuable as a British
possession, it also furnished a strong proof of the desire of the
American Government to deal fairly and liberally wub its
antagonist tu the argument Demonstrating m Uns conclu-
sive manner til it u was not influenced by a captious spirit
of discontent, the Government of the United States derived
from this slate of the case a right to appeal to the British
Government to expedite the final adjustment of the contro-
ver >, and to elaim in the meantime, the full benefit oh its
part of an arrangement which perhaps, gave to its adver-
sary more than an equal share of advantages
But the arrangement has been entirely misunderstood or
inisconstrued, it tlie Lieutenant Governor of New Bruns-
wiok be correct m his exposition of tin orders under which
he is acting The United Stales never did, and never can,
consent that ihe exejusive jurisdiction of the whole, terri-
tory m dispute shall be consigned to the care of any officer
of the British Government 1 he pretension now advanced
is as unreasonable m itself as itis tmsustamed by any agree-
ment between the two Governments Supposing that the
parties to the controversy stand apon an equal looting as to
their rights (and ibere is none other in the ease, except the
inadmissible one formerlj alluded to,) the, United States
hat e as much reason to expect that Great Bantam will yield
to t'u m the exclusive jurisdiction of the whole of the con-
tested teintoiy, logeiher with the care and custody of th&
timber and othei public property, as she has to require
from us such an extravagant concession On the part of
the United btates, it has never been claimed or as&ed, as
far as the committee are informed, and the trae position,
ot the President now is, that he resists the application of a
principle, which no Lxecutive of this country ever adopted
as bin ,_uide It h is not been asked of Great Britain, nor
can it be submitted to from her What the United States
ask from others they are always willing to grant, nor can
they grant what it would be deemed unreasonable to ask
I hat portion of the territory in winch the recent and
present distui banecs exist, has been, for a number of years
past, subject to the laws of "VI line, and, before the separa-
tion of Maine from "VI i«sachtisetts, was under ¡the control
of the latter In December, 1807, Massachusetts conveyed
one township, lying on both sides of the Aioostook, and
near tlie meridian line from the source of the St Croix,ac-
cordmg to a selection, survey, and plan made under a re
solve passed m March, 1806 In January, 1808, she con-
veyed ten thousand aeres, lying west of the aforesaid town-
ship, and on both sides of the Aroostook, pursuant to a
survey and plan made under the same resolve* Tills juris
diclion has been continued, through the medium of land
agents, ever since that time , and the settlers, who hav#
been there for a number of vears past,(certaitily since 3823?)
have ilw ly , in practice, held their property under grants
from Mass tchusett  dná Mame The part remaining un-
settled has been applied to no other useful purjpose than to
u e the nmber,in which it is very productive, olid the State
of Massachusetts has been in the practice of granungheen-
scs tohcr people to cut timber from thepubhc domain The
exercise ot jurisdiction was as perfectas the naturp of the
country would permit The mere fact of granting heenses
to cut timber to certain individuals shows that the preser
a anon of the timber was held to be an object of great con
sequence, and drew after it the incidental right of refusing
to permit the timber to be cut down, whenever it was
thought wise to do so , or of taking other measures for its
preservation, by driving off trespassers, or punishing them
by civil process ThisrightMainederivedfromMassachu
setts Ever> State government in the Union has a right to
regulate the landed interest, whether public or pnvate,
within its limits and Maine stand  upon the tame footing,
unless as to such parts of it as are decided not to be under
its jurisdiction by the exercise of the constitutional powers!
of the lederal Government But, as has been already ob
served, no proceeding or agreement of the Federal Govern
ment can be found which did not recognize an actual juris
diction, just such as tint now claimed and enforced by
Maine Whether the Legislature of that State ought or
ought not, in courtesy to the Federal Government, to have
invoked its interposition before dnvmg off the trespassers
with a strong hand, is a q uestion which the committee deem
it unnecessary to examine, because the pietensions ad
vaneed by the Lieutmant Govt rnor of ftew Brunswick
equally excludi the right of the United States and Maine to
interfere II ihe United 'Hates had been applied to, and
the urgency of the ease had rendeied a promptand foicible
interposition nece sary to remove those lawless trespassers
who were equally the enemies of both Governments, tlie
same opposition would have been made to such interior
ence by the Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick, and
the same question arisen as m the present case
1 he conflicting claim  of Great Britain and the United
State  are now presented in antagomstica! position to each
other, and the subordinate question as to the manner m
which thox have thus been brought in direct opposition is
not of sufficient importance to require a strict e'iamination
If it were, it might be argued that the conduct of tbeLieu
tenant Governor of New Brunswick in directing a boom
to be placed across the mmufi oí jüue Aroostook river, for
