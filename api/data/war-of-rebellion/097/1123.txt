Honorable E. M. STANTON:

There is a large number of paroled rebel officers at Fort Monroe, congregated there under some agreement, as they say, between General Grant and Lee to give them transportation to Southern ports. This is now refused, and they are in a destitute condition. The commander of the French corvette Phagelon has offered to take a part of them to New York and put them on a New Orleans steamer without landing. Is there any objection to their accepting this after?

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

As the Treasury agents here are acting under orders of the Treasury Department, I do not see that I can any further interfere with their operations. It is very evident to me that a system of corruption and oppression is springing up here like that on the Mississippi River. Having called attention to it my responsibility ceases.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Washington:

General Rosser came within our lines to arrange for the surrender of his command at Stauton. A cavalry force was sent out with him to receive their arms and paroles. He was not captured, but surrendered himself on the terms of Lee's capitulation and promised that his entire command should lay down their arms. Report of guerrilla band at Lynchburg not well founded. General Wright reports that it will require some days to remove public property from Danville, and that a military force will be required there at present on account of the large number of disbanded rebel soldiers in that vicinity. This will cause a little delay in sending the Sixth Corps to Alexandria.

HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,Washington, May 10, 1865.

Major-General HALLECK,

Richmond, Va.:

You need not order the arrest of General Rosser unless it can be done in good faith. I was informed that he had been captured, and knew that he had left Lee's army after it had been surrendered. You may keep all of the Sixth Corps until further orders, except that portion that may be mustered out under general orders for reducing the military establishment of the United States.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
