entered Petersburg unmolested. After waiting there about two hours I was ordered by General Hartranft back to the old camp, where I arrived about 10 a. m. and turned over the command of the brigade to Colonel J. A. Mathews, Two hundred and fifth Pennsylvania Volunteers.

Before closing my report I cannot refrain from mentioning that all of my command, both officers and men, exhibited the highest gallantry and bravery. Each one exerted himself to the utmost to accomplish the part of the work assigned him.

My loss was very heavy. Six of the enemy's guns were captured by my men in the captured forts. The number of prisoners captured by my brigade will not fall far short of 1,000, with their arms. To determine the exact number is an impossibility.

My casualties are as follows: Commissioned officers, killed, 6; wounded, 20; missing, 1. Enlisted men, killed, 76; wounded, 310; missing, 33. Aggregate, 446.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBT. C. COX,

Colonel, Commanding 207th Pennsylvania Volunteers.

Major JOHN D. BERTOLETTE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
