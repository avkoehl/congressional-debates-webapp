Washington, D. C., July 16, 1864.

Colonel J. H. POTTER,

Actg. Asst. Provost-Marshal-General, Columbus, Ohio:

There is no illegality whatever in the draft for deficiency in subdistricts, whether the State is head or not. You can readily perceive this by reading the law.

Have the accounts closed up with a view to a correct settlement for future quotas.

Provost-Marshal-General.

General J. B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General:

Colonel Todd will be in Washington on Monday or Tuesday to compare the account kept here with yours of men furnished by Pennsylvania. Whatever may be the result, it is better that a question so delicate should be definitely settled, and I ask that no further proceeding be had until he arrives.

Assistant Secretary:

Governor Cony has already overrated importance of rebel demonstration from New Brunswick. There are no vessels whatever, and less than a score of men. A Union man with party will give due notice of all danger.
