MUNFORDVILLE, October 8, 1863.

Captain A. C. SEMPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Major Martin has returned from the pursuit of rebels. He recaptured 2 wagons, 3 mules and 70 guns. He reports that 60 of his men were captured at Glasgow and the remainder are scattered through the country. He suffered his command to be surprised. He reports that rebels were in Tompkinsville this morning. The information was brought in by citizens. I have instructed my command relative to the expected raid. It would be well to send all the cavalry you have to spare, from other points, to this place and Cave City. Colonel Spaulding had not arrived at Glasgow at 4 p.m.

E. H. HOBSON.

Major MARTIN,.

Glasgow:

Rebels have been on Lebanon branch road. Destroyed train. They are all over the country in small squads. Keep your cavalry on the lookout. Learn if possible if Colonel Spaulding is on his way, and give me notice.

Brigadier-General.

MUNFORDVILLE, October 8, 1863.

Major MARTIN,

Glasgow:

Use all the mounted force for picket and scouting purposes. Let the infantry occupy the fort, and hold it; if rebels should make an effort to come into this place, have the pickets understand that they are to assemble at that point if driven in by rebels. Appoint an officer to superintend the pickets and guards, and punish any neglect of duty. If you think the stores are in danger it would be well to move them.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.
