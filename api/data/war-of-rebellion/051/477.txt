(wounded); Major Lowe, of Twenty-third Tennessee Regiment (wounded); Lieutenant-Colonel Floyd, commanding Seventeenth Tennessee Regiment, and Major Davis, of Seventeenth Tennessee Regiment (wounded and captured). Adjutants Cross, Gwyn, and Fitzpatrick, and Lieutenant Greigg, who came into the action on Sunday morning; also Captain Terry, who, after he was wounded on Saturday evening, rendered me valuable service on Sunday.

Mention may also be made of the following: Private (ex-captain) Riddley, of Twenty-third Tennessee, who went into the action and fought manfully with a gun, setting a good example to all; Lieutenant Vernon, of Company B, Twenty-third Tennessee, for the manner in which he bore himself.

On entering the action this command numbered as follows, viz:

Command.	 Officers.	 Men.	 Aggregate.

44th Tennessee	 28	 266	 294

25th Tennessee	 25	 120	 145

23rd Tennessee	 28	 153	 181

17th Tennessee	 27	 222	 249

Battery	 	 	 85

Total	 	 	 954

The numbers of the different regiments of this command were thus small, the barefooted men having been sent to the rear, by order from division commander, as follows: Forty-fourth Tennessee,56 men; Twenty-fifth Tennessee, 23 men; Twenty-third Tennessee, 26 men; Seventeenth Tennessee, 120 men and 2 officers. Aggregate, 227.

My loss was as follows:

Command.	 Killed.	 Wounded. 	 Captured	 Aggregate.

 	 	 and

 	 	 missing.

44th Tennessee	 10	 88	 15	 113

17th Tennessee	 	 61	 69	 130

23rd Tennessee	 8	 77	 13	 98

25th Tennessee	 10	 45	 1	 56

Battery	 	 3	 	 3

Total	 28	 274	 98	 400

I have much pleasure in stating that there was no straggling, either by officer or men. I have also great satisfaction in noticing the medical appointments of this brigade for promptness and efficiency. The care and treatment of the wounded by Dr. Jackson, Forty-fourth Tennessee, acting brigade surgeon; Dr. Slummer and Dr. Harris, of Twenty-third Tennessee; Dr. Jones, of Seventeenth Tennessee, and Drs. Fryar and Jackson, of Twenty-fifth Tennessee. I also return my thanks to Dr. John Ganaway, who volunteered his service that the wounded of this brigade received attention second to no other brigade in the army commanded by General Bragg.
