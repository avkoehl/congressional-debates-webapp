Vigorous demonstrations were made yesterday. We lost 200 in killed and wounded at Moron's Ford last evening. We punished the enemy sharply and took about 60 prisoners. The operation is still going on. Information from Harrisonburg Wednesday last make Early and Imboden moving on Winchester. Our scouts from the valley will be in to- night or to- morrow morning. One result of the co- operation with General Butler has been to prove that it has spoilt the best chance we had for a successful attack on the Rapidan.
