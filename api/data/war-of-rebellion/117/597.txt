ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, October 3, 1862.

Honorable G. V. FOX, Assistant Secretary of the Navy.

DEAR SIR: In reply to yours of the 22nd ultimo I will say that so far as I am aware it has not been the custom on the part either of the United States or the rebel authorities to restore prisoners their side-arms except when such restoration was especially stipulated for, as it was with General Buckner and others taken with him. The rebels have been notoriously eager to strip our officers and men with but few exceptions of not only everything in the shape of weapons but even of money and clothing.

Yours, very truly,

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

By command of Brigadier-General Wadsworth:

JOHN P. SHERBURNE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS PIKE COUNTY REGIMENT, ENROLLED MISSOURI MILITIA,Louisiana, Mo., October 3, 1862.

Brigadier General LEWIS MERRILL.

DEAR SIR: I have the honor to report to you that on last Wednesday the rebel Captain C. C. Micklin, of Porter's force, and Harvey Walton, both desperate bushwhackers, were overhauled while attempting to pass this county by a squad of my men under command of Lieutenant McPike. Resisting they were fired upon by our men and both were mortally wounded. Micklin is dead; Walton will die. Micklin was from Lincoln County, Walton from Audrain.

Very respectfully,

GEORGE W. ANDERSON,

Colonel, Commanding.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, October 4, 1862.

Governor ROBINSON, Louisville, Ky.:

The President's absence has delayed reply to your telegram of the 2nd instant. The Department is desirous of adopting a system in regard to the paroled prisoners that will correct or avoid the evils complained of. The President's return to-day is expected and you will be speedily notified what arrangements the Government will be able to make.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
