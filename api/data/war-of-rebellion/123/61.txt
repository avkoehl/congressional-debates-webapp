SAINT PAUL, May 21, 1862. (Received 12.15 a. m. 22nd.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Would be difficult to raise a regiment at this season, unless the people were assured there was an imperative necessity. General Halleck has called on us to recruit for our regiments in his department. This will tax us heavily at this season.
