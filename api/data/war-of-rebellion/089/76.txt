HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,October 4, 1864-4.30 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The affair of pickets is over. I shall burn the little white house to prevent further disturbance. The following is the report of the signal officer:

GENERAL: The firing has developed the enemy along their line in considerable larger force than there have heretofore appeared. Their tents along as far as can be seen are not struck and there appears no indications of their intending to move our of their works. They are standing under arms with artillery run out. Not more than one piece can be seen in any one place. It appears extended at intervals along their front. The excitement evidently originated exclusively with the pickets.

Captain and Signal Officer.

Major-General.

P. S.-Signal station is on my west front south of Pegram's.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, October 4, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS:

I send a prisoner from Eleventh North Carolina, MacRae's brigade, captured this eve in the affair of skirmishers. He brings a Petersburg paper of the 3rd, which states that General Dunovant, commanding Butler's old brigade, was killed; also Colonel Bookter and Stuart's old medical director, Doctor Fontaine; two colonels wounded.

October 4, 1864.

Colonel SAMUEL HARRIMAN, Commanding First Brigade:

COLONEL: The general commanding directs that you occupy the new line of works, which was commenced this afternoon, by a full line of battle. You will see that the troops are moved forward immediately if it has not already been done.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HDQRS. SECOND Brigadier, FIRST DIV., NINTH ARMY CORPS,October 4, 1864-2 p. m.

Captain YOUNGMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Ninth Army Corps:

Five scouts sent out from the Second Brigade, First Division, were fired upon by the enemy, killing one man (a sergeant) and taking three prisoners. One of the party returned. The enemy's line of pickets (the scouts report) are beyond the woods, in the clearing. This clearing, I presume, is to the right of the front, facing westward, say opposite the four guns on the left of Ninth Corps.

I am, yours, &amp;c.,

J. F. HARTRANFT,

Corps Officer of the Day.
