GENERAL JACKSON'S FINE
Mr O J. INGERSOLL, from the Committee
on the Judiciary, rcse :.nd legged leave to repon a
bill for the re'ief of Gt neral Jackson. He sup-
posed it would be necessary ¡o move the suspen-
sion of the rule ; for the reception of this b.ll, and
he would, therefore, male nat motion
[Cries of "Oh, no, there w d be m objecticn "]
There being no oojeciiou theie o, he aponed tt e
bill, and ir was read a first and second tine    It
was a bill to rest us "he fi^e ot $1,000 imposed o i
General Jarkof n in 1815
Mr INGERSOLL tn n rose to present a report
to accompany ihe bill ju>iread, and he sa'd it was
due to hinrelf, and to -cme members of trie com-
mittee, (a majority ol whom were opposed to ac-
companying tae bill with th.s report,) that he
should say that be offered it as the report of three
members of ihe committee, and, as such, he trusted
it would be ¡aid on the table, and be primed He
submitted that motion.
Mr. BARNARD begged leave to submit to ihe
House (that ihe House might act undera'andmgly)
the fact—which it was due to the Committee on ihe
Judiciary should be known—ihat it was true, as
stated by the gen'leman fiom Pennsylvania, nat
the GomTi'tee on the Judiciary had directed him
to report a b'H for the relief of General Jackson
It vas also true hat the honor, b'e ge tleman
from Pennsylvania presented a writtei rep rt,
which was not adop ¡>i by the comm ttee, and
there was, therefore, no repor' of tne cotirpittee
accompanying the bi 1. The question fur the House
to determine, therefore, wa°, v. he 'it they woj1 I,
for the fir-t time m the practice of tie Hou e,
adopt, in the shape of a rmion>y retort, a p<"per
emanating from one or more oí t^e c mm ttee,
when the majori'y of the committee ha 1 naae no
report wha e/er. That wia the t nly exception be

thai he had ai acquaintance now suffering impus-
onment tor debt, to whom it was a matter of some
impt nance, an! as this was private b.ll day, he
hoped.it would be taken up and acted upon.
Mr. FILLMORE refused te yie'd, and persisted
in calling for the orders of the day.
Mr. MATHIor asked it this was not one of the
dajs set apart for private business, and, as such,
he hoped it would be devoted to its legitimate busi-
ness
Tne House, however, took up the apporiionment
biV.
Tne question which was ppnumg at the adjourn-
ment la t n ght was, "Wi 1 the Hou„c recede from
its disagreement to the amendments of the Senate V

certain decisions, and the proper mode of procesd-
ing, in which Messrs EVERETT, J CAMP-
