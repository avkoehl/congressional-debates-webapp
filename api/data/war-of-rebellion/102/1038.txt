General Brown, commandant of the garrison of Brownsville, and I now have the honor to reproduce for You the same reply transmitted to the said general officer on two different occasions, the 7th and 15th of the present month. I have no powers to decide for myself the return of the property mentioned, nor do I possess the necessary data to designate the same. But my opinion is that this matter will be the object of an easy adjustment the respective Governments in harmony with the legitimate interests of both countries. I ought to add that, in order to remove all the inconveniences which now exist, I have already, for my part, asked for ample instructions from the Government of His Majesty the Emperor Maximilian.

Be pleased, general, to accept the assurance of my high esteem.
