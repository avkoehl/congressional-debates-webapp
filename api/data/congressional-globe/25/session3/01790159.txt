Mr EVERETT. To a Committee of the i
Whole on the state of the Union                             '
The SPEAKER. It is the same thing. The
Chair then reiterated several former decisions of
the House, identical with the one then under con-
sideration In the fiist session of ¡he Twenty-
Fourth Congress, while the select committee raised
under the resolution of Mr Pmckney, on the sub-
ject of slaveiy, was in existence, a gentleman
from Virginia, not now a member of this House,
(Mi Patton,) presented certain joint íesolutions
of the Legislature of that State on the subject of
abolition, and moved their leference to that com-
mittee, with ceitam msti notions There was an
existing Older then in foice for the reference of
all papers on this subject to that select committee
under similar piohibmons against being read,
debated, &c , and undei the general phraseology
of that Older, the piesent Speaker decided that
resolutions of State Legislatuies fell within its
order Fiom that decision Mr Patton took an
[ appeal, and upon a solemn vote of the House the
decision was sustained by a vote of 143 to 40.
Upon the point as to reading such resolutions, the
same question was decided at the same time, and
again at the subsequent sessions, viz that, under
the then existing orders, they could not be read
At the same session of that Congress a memorial
on the subjectof abolition,&C , was presented by
the same gentleman from Vermont, who asked
for its reading The Speakei decided it must go
to the select committee without reading, and the
i House acquiesced in that decision At the second
I session of that Congiess, the gentleman fiom
1 Massachusetts, [Mr Adams,] aftei the adoption
j of an order similar to the one now in force, pre-
sented a memorial on the subjectof abolition, and
called foi its leading The Speaker doeidtd that
it must go on the table without being read, punted,
or refened, lecitmg the words of the order An
appeal was taken from this decision, and the ap-
peal was laid on the table On the same occasion,
Mi Adams presented upwards of twenty other
simiKi petitions, and asked the leading of each
The bpeaker made the same decision in each case,
the gentleman appealed in every one of them, and
the appeals were severally laid on the table by a
vote of the House These questions had been
lepeatedly settled by the House
Mi   BRONSON had mteded at fiist (he said)
to demand  the pievious question,  but he now
moved to lay the appeal on the table
Mi. EVERETT called foi the yeas and nays
