Dates from North Carolina of the 19th and 20th instant through rebel papers report continued fighting on those days between Johnston and Sherman at Bentonville, N. C., in which, on the 19th, our forces were forced back one mile. On the 20th the battle was renewed, and finally our forces apparently resumed the offensive. Confederate loss, 500; Federal loss, 5,000. Report from Mobile through same source March 22 states that a column 2,000 strong is about to move from Pensacola, and another 10,000 strong from Milton, Fla., under Canby; destination, Selma. Thomas is to make a simultaneous movement from Vicksburg. Other accounts place the entire force operating against Mobile and Selma at 30,000.
