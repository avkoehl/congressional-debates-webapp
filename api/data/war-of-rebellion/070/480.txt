HARPER'S FERRY, May 17, 1864-8.30 p. m.

Lieutenant W. B. KELLEY,

Cumberland:

Sigel had a fight with Breckinridge near New Market on Sunday.

Our loss about 600 and 5 pieces of artillery. Sullivan safe. Colonel Lincoln, of the Thirty-fourth Massachusetts, wounded. I will go up in the morning. I thin you had better go via Bedford or Wheeling.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

BALTIMORE, May 17, 1864.

Brigadier-General KELLEY:

Darby reports 3,600 Ohio troops at Martinsburg for Washington waiting to be transferred at Ferry, and nearly as many more on the way. Wont you see that they are properly supplied with commissary stores and quarters while waiting? We can transfer them the moment we get a pontoon up, which ought to be to-morrow morning.

W. P. SMITH.

WILLIAM P. SMITH, Esq.,

Camden Station, Baltimore:

The report is too true, General Sigel was met by Echols' and Imboden's forces, commanded by Breckinridge. Please go to Washington in the morning and hurry up the bridge. You will learn particulars at Washington in regard to the battle. Sullivan is safe.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

BALTIMORE, May 17, 1864.

General B. F. KELLEY:

Thanks for your dispatch. I have fully telegraphed General Meigs, and will leave at 7 a. m. to urge forwarding of bridge. If report of repulse is true, and enemy know state of our road, they may do great damage, if strong enough. I hope it is a false alarm. Where could it have occurred, and who was against him? Nothing done by Army of the Potomac since Thursday last. Lee at rest only four miles back in very strong place. It is said Sherman doing well. Butler moving slowly on Darling. Rebels here say Breckinridge and Morgan in front of Sigel. Do you expect anything from enemy above? How are Crook and Averell doing?

W. P. SMITH.
