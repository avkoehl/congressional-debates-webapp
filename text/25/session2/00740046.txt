tion, as modified, submitted by Mr HAYNES
3 Resolved, That so much of said Message as
relates 10 the finances, and every thing connected
therewith, to the safe-keeping of the public moneys,
and every thine, connected theiewith, be retened
to ihe Committee of Ways and Vleans
And ihe amendment moved thereto bj Mr
CUSH1NG, as follows
Wneieas he influence of ih  Executive d p r-
ment of the Federal Government has, for some
lime past, in derogation of the letter and spirit of
the Constitution, continued to incieise, and ought
to be diminished
Resolved, thei efore, That in order to 001 rect the
said abuse, so much of the President's Message as
relates to the collection, safe keeping, and transfer
of the public money be refei red to
with instructions to report—
First, such method of keeping the public trea-
sure, effect , and other property, as in the judg-
ment of said committee shall most conduce to pro-
mote the welfare and to secure the liberties of the
people, and,
Secondly, such other reforms m the practices of
the Government as in their opinion shall tend to
bring back the administration thereof to the stand-
ard of the original purity of the Constituti n
After some evplaudt jry remarks Irom Mr
CUSHING,
Mr EWING wished to make a few observations
in re'ation to what had been said the other daj by
the gentleman from Cincinnati, (Mr Duncan )
He contended that Mi D ha 1 evaded the ques-
tions propounded, by offering him a piescription,
and calling upon him to define what Fedenlism
was He certiinly felt much affected by tne kind-
ness of that gentleman, but he begged to tell him
that, when hs wanted medicine, he would employ a
regular phjsician He considered the prescitpttons
hitherto prepared by the Committee ol Wajsand
Means, as inadequate to effect a cure oí the pre-
sent evils, and concluded his remarks bj giving
Mr D some advice as to the course of leading he
ought to pursue in order to obtain a just idea of
the true state of the country
Mr DUNCAN w as much amused at the speech
just made by the gentleman from Indiana, and his
teamed disquisition on medicine The last time
he had administered a cathaitic to the gentleman,
but as that did not appear to produce the effect in-
tended, he would, on the next occasion, administer
an anodyne
Mr UNDERWOOD should make but a few ob-
servations He considered it an undeniable fact
that all the present difficulties of the ccuntryweie
attributable to the orginic construction of the Go
verntnent, the continual tendency of which «as to
concentrate power in the hands of the Executive
In his opinion the only remedy was so to ?mend
the Constitution as to prevent that tendencj, and at
some futme time he would take occas on to offer
resolutions to that effect Mr U then referred to
the various Executive departments, m which he
said there was much which called foi the attention
of the House He adverted at some length to the
"Exploring Expedition,' to the Florida war, and
to the alfeoged grievances in the post Office De-
partment, which he charged with great neglect in
the n asportation of papers sent by members to
their constituents He complained that the Presi-
dent was giving them lectures on the New York
elections, instead of suggesting measures of reform
He then expressed his views in reference to the
establishment of a National Bank, which he con-
tended was the only means of regulating and pro-
ducing a uniform currency, and on that ground was
opposed to the relerence of the subject to the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means, as that Committee had
at the late special session reported a resolution ad-
verse to tne establishment of such an institution
Mr MALLORY addressed the committee on the
subject of a resolution heretofoie offered by him,
calling for information respecting the delay of the
sailing of the South Sea Exploring Expedition He
gave a statement of the appropriations made at
various times for that object, and charged the Se-
cretaiy of the Navy with gross mismanagement m
relation to it He also took a general view of the
navy, and maintained that ns condition was such
as imperatively demanded an investigation

TO THE EDITORS OP THE CLOBE
Gentlemen The resolution submitted Ir the
Senate by me yesterday, was not tne reso*ation
published as mine m the Globe of this morning
The following is that which I laid on the table, to
be called up on a future day
" Resolved, That the Committee for the District
of Columbia be instructed to inquire into the ex-
pediency of authorizing the people of the said
District to elect a delegate to the House of Repre^-
sentatives df the United Slates, to enjoy the rights*
and privileges of the delegates of the respective
Territories of the United ¡states '
In the Globe of yesterday, Mr Clay of Alabama
is represented to have called for the reading of the
resolutions of the Legislature of Vermont, pre-
sented to the Senate by Mr Swift, m favor of the
abolition of «slavery m tne District of Columbia,
the suppression of the domestic slave trade between
the States, and against the annexation of Texas to
the United States This is also a mistake I called
ior the reading of those resolutions, because they
were not distinctly described by the Senator pre-
senting them, because, m consequence of this, the
Southern Senators seemed not to have noticed their
presentation, because, having previously read
them, and deeming much of the language m the
resolutions, and m the report which accompanied
them, to be unconstitutional, inflammatory, and
calculated to inSict a seneus blow upon the Union
oí the States, I deemed it my dutv to call the special
attention of the Senate to them.
Very respectfully,
JOHN NOHVELL.
