uniform value, supplying only the demand of
increased and increasing trade and business.
By this means the Government may save
$460,000 annually, being 1 per cent, on the
$46,000,000 of 3 per cent, certificates, equal in
currency to $516,000, and 4 per cent, gold on
$54,000,000, which is $2,160,000, equal in
currency to $2,420,000, or a total saving of
$2,936,000.
HOW TO KEEP CURRENCY OF UNIFOnJI VALUE—RESUMP-
TION.
Within six months gold has fluctuated in
value from 12 to GO per cent, premium over
greenbacks. Something must bo done to secure
uniformity of value. The bulls and bears
of Wail street, the gold gamblers, amass for-
tunes by creating panic and misfortune, and no
man knows -when or how life may safely pursue
an honest business. (See Eep. No. 81, House
Heps. 41sf Cong, 2d Sess.) The bill under con-
sideration provides that the Secretary of the
Treasury shall on demand redeem greenbacks
in gold, at 80 cents com for every greenback
dollar for two years, and after that at an
advance of 1 per cent, every six months until
par is reached in twelve years, the greenbacks
so brought into the Treasury to be paid out in
disbursements or exchanged for gold at the
same rate, but in no case less than the current
market rate. Asa part of this scheme duties may
be paid in greenbacks at the prescribed rates,
and when the current market premium on gold
is not less than the prescribed rates, interest
on national bonds may be paid in the same way
to holdeis so electing, and in California, Ne-
vada, and Oregon, wheregold isin common use
the revenues may be collected in coin at the
prescribed rates if not greater than the current
maiket rates. This will demolish gold opera-
tions in Wall street, and the gold gamblers'
" occupation will be gone." This means the
resumption of specie payments in twelve years
and a currency all thy time of fixed value, or
if resumption comes sooner it will not be forced
but the result of commercial and industrial
causes.
Till', rUF.SENT PRICE OP COLD.
I know the current market rate of gold is
less than the prescribed rates of the bill. In
September, 1868, gold was 145 ; it fluctuated,
but generally with a gradual decline, till in
March, 1869, it touched 130]-, its lowest point
for three preceding years ; and it more than
maintained this rate until within the last few
weeks, when our heavy exports of cotton and
breadstufi's, with the favorable result of our
foreign commerce for six months, and gold
operations in New York to depress gold, have
united to bring gold down to 112. if com-
mercial causes can continue this result, the
country will take the consequences in a shrink-
age of values of property. And if we may
not legislate to avoid this, we can at least
legislate to prevent the fluctuations in values
so disastrous to all the interests of the country,
and fix a poiut beyond which gold shall not
ascend or greenbacks depreciate.
SPEEDY RESUMPTION* IMPOSSIBLE.
With $700,000,000 ot paper currency and only
$250,000,000 coin, resumption is impossible.
Our annual product of gold and silver is grad-
ually diminishing, while the export to pay in-
terest in Europe has rapidly increased in the
last ten years. Jii I860 less thau $2,000,000
in gold coin would pay the annual interest on
ail national, Slate, municipal, and corporation
bonds held iu Europe, while now it will require
over $100,000,000, and the total value of our
coinage for the fiscal year ending June 80,1869,
was only $34,881,958, and the total product of
gold and stiver, includingthis coinage, has been
estimated sufficiently high at $72,615,121.
In 1860, with $207,000,000 paper currency
and $i00?000,000 coin, any sudden aud great
tor coil, deraoged the condition ot the
banks and the business of the country, and
finally the rebellion precipitated suspension.
THE EOAD TO RESUMPTION.
The road to resumption is to reduce expend-
itures, encourage productive industry, and con-
tinue an honest and economical administration
of the Government.
NATIONAL REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES.
General Grant's administration has honestly
collected the revenues, and been economical
in expenditures, as shown by comparing the
receipts and expenditures during the last year
of President Johusoti and the first of President
Grant, as follows :
Receipts from March 1,18G8, to March 1,1869.
From customs §170,200,692 79
From internal revenue 155,138,168 99
From other sources    36,929,656 99
$358,263.513 77
Receipts from March 1, 1869, to March 1,1870.
From customs $179,956,743 85
From internal revenue  175,467,1-11 01
From other sources  30,535,213 93
$39-1,959,098 82
This is an increase of $26,090,580 in one
year, of which more than $20,000,000 is inter-
nal revenue, notwithstanding a large reduction
in the rate of taxes. Over $75,000,000 of the
internal revenue for the last year were from
spirits, tobacco, and fermented liquors.
The expenditures for eleven months of John-
son's last year, and Grant's first, show this
result:
Total expenditures from March 1,1SS3, to February
1, 1869, were.  &327,067,2S4 53
Total expenditures from March 1,1869,
to February 1,1870  271,927,303 09
Decrease in eleven months  855,139,981 14
Or a reduction of J5,000,000 a month and $60,000,000 a
year, equal to the interest on $1,000,000,000 of the
public debt.
THE TARIFF.
Taxation in every form should protect and
encourage labor and all our industries. Our
policy is to levy heavy duties on articles of lux-
ury, foreign wines, brandies, silks, broadcloths,
and other commodities consumed by the wealthy
or the extravagant, which drain the country of
coin, but add nothing to our resources." On
other articles less rates should be levied, so
far as duties may be necessary to raise revenue
and in such form as to impose no unjust bur-
dens on industry or the wages of labor.
RESUMPTION.
Resumption of specie payments can only fol-
low accumulated wealth. We must, as citizens
and as a nation, produce more than we con-
sume, sell more than we buy. The Secretary
of the Treasury in his report says :
" The ability of the country to resumo specie pay-
ments will not be due to any special legislation upon
that subject, but to the condition of its industries,
and to its financial relations to other countries.
These, of courso,wiHbe more or lessdependentupon
the general policy of the Government."
Speedy resumption can only be effected by a
contraction of the currency, followed by low
prices of property and wages, enabling the cred-
itor to destroy the debtor class and bring wide-
spread financial ruin.
The bill now before us follows the recom-
mendation of the President's message, which
suggested—
"The propriety of redeeming our currency nt its
market value, increasing tho rate at which currency
will be bought and sold Irom day to day, or week to
week, &c.
One of the ablest of the great newspapers of
the country on the 25th of October said :
" There must be a divorce of the Administration
from the markets. What better way could be de-
vised, under the present diseased currency system,
than to fix a rate at which the Treasury will sell gold
to all comers ? This should bo high enough to be
safe. Suppose the Government shall provide that it
will cash all the greenbacks presented in gold at 45
premium. Gold could not go abovo th.it. It would
be free to go lower. And if it should stand steadily
at 45, so long as we havo the presentrolumo of cur-
rency. it would be better for all the interests of the
oountry."—Cincinnati Gazette.
The opinions I am now urging I maintained
in an article in the New York Time? of Janu-
ary 9, 1869.
We cannot resume in two or three or four
years, for if this were certain, the advance in
the value of greenbacks would be so great that
holders would hoard them away because more
profitable to keep than use as currency.
EXPERIENCE OP ENGLAND.
England suspended specie payments on the
27th of February,_ 1797, and while the suspen-
sion continued, in 1819, Parliament passed
"Peel's currency bill," "for the restoration
of cash payments" "from and after the 1st
day of May, 1823," and abolished all bank
notes loss than £5. But this bill commenced
gradual resumption, "beginning with an issue
of gold at £4 Is. the ounce in -1820, and end-
ing with the standard mint price of £3 17s.
lO^-d!." In other words, redemption of notes
at a discount—gradual resumption.
But Mr. Cobbett declared that—
"Before this bill could be carried into complete
execution, 1,000,000 persons at least must die of
hunger.'"—
that it never would be completely carried out,
and that—
"if it were so he would suffer Castleroagli to broil
him alive, whilo Sidmoulh stirred the coals, and
Cunning stood by to make a jest of his groans."
Cobbett was right. In 1823 Parliament re-
spited from resumption the £1 and £2 notes for
eleven years; and though the Bank of England
did not acccpt the respite the other banks did,
issued more currency, and thus relieved the
distress which resumption had brought; but,
unfortunately, by adding '■ not less than GO per
cent." to the circulating money up to 1826,
stimulated speculation, followed by contraction,
producing new disasters, and iu May, 1820, the
£1 and £2 country bank notes ceased to be
circulated. From February, 1816, to August,
1817, the Bank of England reduced its dis-
counts from £23,000,000 to £7,000,000, and
between 1819 and 1822 reduced her circula-
tion nearly by £7,000,000, and her discounts to
merchants from £11,000,000 to £4,000,000.
But the financial historian tells us the effect was
that—
"The universal fall of prices ruined thousands.
The distress, ruin, and bankruptcy"
"were univcisal, affecting both the great interests of
land and trade; but among the landtoreU whoso
estates were burdened by mortgages" ^ v *
"the ellccts wero most marked." " , * "
"In hundreds of cases, from the tremendous reduc-
tion in the price of land," -i! "tho
estates barely sold for as mucli as would pay off the
mortgages; and hence the owners were stripped of
all and made beggars."
Alison, in his History of Europe, referring
to Peel's bill of 1819, says:
"The sudden and prodigious contraction of tho
currency rendered the next three years a period of
ceaseless distress and suffering. Tho etfcct upon
prices was not less immediate or appalling. They
sauk in general within six months to half their foi-
mer amount, and remained at that low level lop
the next three years. Imports sunk Irom nearly
£36,000,000 in 1818 to £29,769,000 in 16^1; exports truin
£45,000,000 in the former year to £35,000,000 in the
latter."
Speedy resumption would bring similar ca-
lamities here. Our imports and exports would
diminish, the means of paying interest ou the
public debt would be diminished, the national
credit would be impaired, bonds would go
down in value, public aud private debts would
maintain their proportions, with all tho means
of payment reduced. Half the States of the
South, with their immense State debts, would
fail to make provision to pay interest, as some
of the States did after the financial crisis of
1836. To avort evils like these resumption
must be gradual, so that present indebtedness
may be paid ou the basia of the prices under
which it a contracted.
