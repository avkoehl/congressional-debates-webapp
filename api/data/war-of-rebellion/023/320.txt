General THOMAS,

There is a large bridge party on the road employed by the superintendent.

General Wood's wagons should have been repaired before. The orders have been for some time for the troops to be prepared to march at the shortest notice.

General THOMAS,

Decherd:

General Cruft says no guards are sent on trains from Decherd to Murfreesborough. Did you get dispatch directing 40 men to be sent on each train?

J. M. WRIGHT.

HUNTSVILLE, August 12, 1862.

General THOMAS:

There should be a guard at Tullahoma already; if not, leave four of Colonel Wagner's companies for the present. I take it for granted they are fortified.

D. C. BUELL.

TULLAHOMA, August 12, 1862.

General WOOD:

I have four companies of the Ninth Michigan and four companies of the Fourth Kentucky Cavalry. Will leave in the morning at 4 o'clock with my brigade.

Lieutenant-Colonel Van Horn has sent for re-enforcements for Wartrace. I will send some cavalry out that way and will send infantry by the train if I hear firing; but do not think it possible for an enemy to be in the neighborhood with any force.

G. D. WAGNER.
