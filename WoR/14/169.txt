Fort Monroe, May 13, 1862.

Honorable GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy:

From what I gather, Rodgers, when last heard from, on the 11th instant, was at a point about 25 miles this side of City Point. The Monitor and Stevens have probably joined him ere this. Some delay may be experienced at the obstructions placed by the enemy 10 miles this side of Richmond, but nothing more I apprehend, nor do I think the delay will be beyond half a day or so at most, although, of course, it is impossible for me to judge with any great precision upon the subject.

Honorable GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy, Washington City:

SIR: The reports in the papers about the navy-yard at Norfolk are utterly and entirely false. Tho have destroyed it more effectually than has been done would indeed have been a difficult task. Essentially, it is in utter ruins.
