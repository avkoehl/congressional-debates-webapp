at Fulton's and Dooley's ferry and those of the Little Missouri (three I think in number). These are recommended by the chief engineer of the department to be fortified.

Sixth. Major-General Price had returned, as I am informed, with only about fifty wagons, and with fewer arms by 5,000 or 6,000 stand than he took with him. He has also with him, as I am informed, 4,000 or 5,000 recruits unarmed. Transportation must be supplied his army, and many thousand arms, say 10,000 are required to make this unarmed force of any use. These may be perhaps procured from Selma and through Texas, but no orders from department headquarters for their procurement from Selma have been issued that I am aware of since the arrival of the 1,360 stand, which I sent for with the sanction of the general commanding. I am doing all I can to get possession of the government arms in the hands of the citizens or from deserters, and have recommended to department headquarters that the same course be pursued as to these Government arms in the hands of citizens in Texas. It might be pursued also in Louisiana. With respect to transportation for Price's army I can say that it is impossible to procure it in Arkansas without driving the people off.

Seventh. I believe the troops in this district have received only two month's pay in about sixteen months, and I am informed by the disbursing officers of the quartermaster and commissary departments that they can get no funds from department headquarters, and that much difficulty and dissatisfaction on the part of citizens would be avoided if they were furnished with funds in the new issue. As this is a mater exclusively in the hands of the department commander, I do not consider it proper to make any suggestions as to the remedy. The above is a plain statement, made with the best intentions and with a sincere desire to assist the general commanding the department in the discharge of his embarrassing duties, a desire which I shall entertain and carry out in regard to my commanding officer as long as I am honored with a commission in the service.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. B. MAGRUDER,

Major-General.
