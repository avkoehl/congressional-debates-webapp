Graduation Bill—Mr. Cnitenden, Mr. Young, of Illinois.

On motion of Mi Crittenden, the Senate then
adjourned.
Tuesday, Ja.nv.ai y 8, 1839
The bill for the graduation and l eduction of the
price of the public lands came up as the special
ordei.the question being on the amendment ot
Mi Clay, of Alabama, proposing to extend the
privilege of purehas ng at the teduced prices to
contiguous landholders, to the amendment pro
posed by the Committee on the Public Lands,
under the instructions of the Senate when the re-
commitment was oidered
Mr CRITTENDEN, who was entitled to the
floor, addiessed the Senate at length in opposition
to the bill lie thought tnat it was a piematuie
measure It proposed to reduce the price of
refuse lands, but it would operate on all the pub
lie lands m maiket There aie upwards of sev-
enty one millions of acies now in market, and it
is computed that not more than three millions of
acies are annually required for settlement How
can these be called iefuse lands, when there is
twenty times the quantity brought into market
that there is a demand for. He thought that its
principal tendency would be to excite speculation
in the public lands A few years since, there
were $20,000,000 invested, when the lands were
held at $1 2j per acre,and this ampunt would be
greatly exceeded were they reduced to seventy
Ave cents Éy the provisions of the bill, the
nchest landholder would be placed upon an equal
loo mg with the poorest occupant, which he
could not assent to He was also opposed to the
bill on account of the discrimination made be
tween citiz°ns ot the dffeient btates, bethought
it invidious and unjust The public lands aic
as much the piopeity of Kentucky or Mas'a
chusetts as ot the States in which they aie
situated They aie the common property of all
the States of this Union, and we are meiely trus
tees to manage it for the public beneft He
knew of no reason why a landholder in Alabama
oi Aikansas should have an exclusive privilege of
purchasing at a reduced rate more than a land
holder in Kentucky or Vngima Mr C went
into an elaborate argument to prove that his col
league [Mr Qlat] was not an enemy of the new
States, and retened to the whole couise of his. life
to contiadict the asseition On the contrary, lie
had been denounced, in another section of the
Union, as an enemy of the old States, and lie sup
posed he was considered as hoslis liumam geneus,
but he was of opinion that some of the advocates
ot the measure weie more anxious to hx this
Umige oí enmity to the new States on his col
league than they were convinced of us truth, and
he thought that the j lopriety or impiopriety of
passing the bill was not determined by the fact
that Ins colleague was hostile oi otherwise to the
interests of the West It was natural enough that
Senatois who repiesent those States that areseeK-
mj these exclusive privileges should, in their zeal,
denounce those who may think it then duty to
oppose them as enemies to the new States, but
was it fun, was it generous? Suppose the eld
States should ask Congress for a donation of five
millions of ac es fur the puiposes of education oi
m einal improvement, at d that a bill for that ¡ ui
pose was brought forward in this body, then
Senators would tell us that it was of gieat im
portance to then States that this bill should pass,
and enlaige on the many advantages that would
accrue to then States by its opeiation What
would Senators say if every one opposed to the
passage of such a bill should be denounced as an
enemy of the old State  > yet it would be equally
generous and just with the course pursued by the
advocates of the measure before theSenate We
have already dealt liberally, very liberally, with
the new States, and have made large donations to
them for educauonal and otner purposes He
ti usted that the proposition ot giving these lands
away to citizens of the new States at twenty five
or fi ty cents per aele less than to citizens of other
poi ions of the Union would not be acceded to
Mi \OUNG, cC Illinois, sail, (in repiy to Mr
Ckiuiadej, of Kentucky ) Irise not,Mr Presi
dent, for any purpose of crimination or ¡ecntr
motion, or to impugn the motives of any, on this
or the other side of the Chamber, much less inten-
tionally to misrepresent what may have been said
by honoiable Senators here, in relation to tnis all-
absorbing subject of the public lands, of which
we have heard so much at the past and piesent
session of Congress I have no feelings of ill will
to giatify—no personal dislikes to induce an un
kind expression towards any Senator who may
have taken pait in these discussions, but 1 desire,
as a duty I owe to the people I represent, to defend
them against unjust animadversion, and to put
some thirgs light in relation to the debate of ti e
last and the piesent sess on, that they may know
and judge fui themselves who has, and who has
not been misiepresented in respect to these de-
bates,and the couisewhichhas been adopted and
acted upon by honorable Senators here in oppo-
sition to .he leading measures, which, whether
well or ill directed, have from time to une been
brought forward to facilitate the settlement, and
expedite the growth of that interesting sect on of
the country whicn stietches along the immense
valley of the West Much has been said, Mr
President, in the progre&s of the debate now going
on, relative to the att tude assumed by the able
Senator from Kentucky, [Mr Clay,] tn lefereoce
to the inhabitants of uie new States, who have
settled upon the public lands, and as his honor-
able colleague [Mi CrhtemjenJ has undertaken
his defence against the charge of hostility to the
West, denies that there is pioof to sustain the ac-
cusation, and says that his colleague has been
misrepresented by those who are determined to
have him, ?ioiens volcm, an enemy to the new States,
I will attempt to snow, that a though language
may have been atti.buted to him which be did not
ube,someof which I have myself setn in the pub
lu prints, that still enough and more than enough
remains to sustain all the material allegations tnat
have been uiged against him
The Senator [Mr CmrTE\DEi,] asks, why it is
that his colleague [Mi Clay] has, alone of all
others, been singled out as the object of vitupera-
tion by the friends of this measuie, why the whole
fountain of Bitter waters has tieen poured out upon
his devoted head, and why it is that he alone is
to be offered up as a sacufice upon the altar of
western interests, for having done what he con
ceived to be his duty in respect to the greater in-
terests of the whole Union Sir, if the Senator
fiom Kentucky [Mr Clay] stands conspicuous
as the ob]ect ot attack in tt is debate, I would ask
his honoiable colleague, [Mr Ckittfnden,] who
placed him m that condition } Has he not, above
all others, at all times, and upon all occas ons,
when the subject of the public lands has been the
toj il of discussion, taken the lead an denouncing
these laulesi intrusions upon the public domain,as
he is pleased to term mem' Has he not, in fact,
to use his own expie&sion, battled i fir d iys to
gethei, "solitary" if not "alone," against our
preemption and gratlnat >n bills, when scaicely a
man ot 1 is paity vould ventme to ti e re cue'
These things cons dered, Mi President, and how
can it be raattei cf wonder orsurpuse to the Sen
ator [Mr Critte\dcn] that his co league s! oukl
be met by the Senatois fiom the new Sta es, upon
the glound he himself has seen fit to occupy, so
fai m advance of his associates, as to have ¡eft
them almost entirely out of sight behind him
Mr Psesident, during the pioiriess of the deoate
on the príenption bill at the last session of Con
gress, ti e h >norable Senator from Kentucky [Mr
Clay] indulged m expiessionstowaids the settlers
of the new States who had gone upon the public
lands for the purpose of procuring homes for them
selves and families, which, in my opinion, they
did not deserve, and as they were repeated on
more than one occasion duimg the couise of that
protracted debate with the utmost deliberation, I
took note of some of them at the time that they
were uttered, in the piecise terms employed by
the speaker as I understood him, and as 1 wish
to recur to these expressions, for the purpose of
showing how far, in tl is iespect, the honorable
Senator [Mr Clay] may or may not have been
misrepresented, as is supposed by his honorable
colleague, [Mr Cphtemden,] 1 will refer to them
as I took them down, and leave the Senate to
judge whether we of the new States, or fhe hon-
orable Senator's colleague, has had the most cause
to o im plain of misrepiesentation The honorable
Senator [\ir ClayJ said, wben discussing the
merits of the preemption bill, and of those who
were to be bei efited by its provisions, in the de-
bate of the 27 Ji of January last, according to my
memorandum, that Tie knew of nolaw oi puuciple
of propuety, which authorized us to give away
the public hi da as a bounty to the j ooi., as a
bounty for a violation pf the law, that he viewed
it (the preemption bill) as a license to a set of
law ess mtiudeis to go upon the pubho domain,
and preveit its sale in the mannei prescribed by
law, that he looked upon trie whole system of
precmptiors as a system of boundless, heartless,
scandalous, fraudulent speculation, tnat it was
full of fiaud, abominable, execrable fraud, a sys-
tem that tanted, corrupted, and putnfied every
one who touched it, that these men (the settlers
upon the public lands) might, with equal pro-
puety, se ze upon our forts and arsenals, our
ships upon the ocean, or plunder the public money
li the i teasury, and appropriate the spoils among
them, as thus to seize upon the public domain,
and hold it against the just demand of the Gov-
ernment
Such, Mr President, are some of the expres-
sions in which the Senator from Kentucky [Mi
Ci ay] indulged at the Jate session of Congress
towaids the settlers of the West
But it is said that the Senator from Kentucky
[M[r Clay] has been misrepresented, intention-
ally misiepresented, and that language has "been
attributed to him on the occasion referred to
which he never uttered This, sir, to some ex
tent, may be true I have seen some newspaper
repot ts of that debate which contained expres-
sions which I do not remember to have heard m
the terms supposed to have been employed, but
the inferences drawn were, neveitheless, m most
instances, correct logical deductions from the
pietmses, as adiritted to have been stated m the
debate As, for example, the Senator did not say
m so many words that the settlers upon the pub-
lic lands were pn ates, but he did say that they
might, with equal propuety, have seized upon
our ships upon the ocean, and hold them against
the lawful right of the nation, as thus to se ze
upon the public lands, and defeat, by unlawful
combinations, a just competition at the public
sales m the manner prescribed by law And
uhat is this but a charge of piracy ? And what
else is a man who commits an overt a,ct of piracy,
such as the Senator has descubed, but a pirate1*
He did not say that they were robbers, hut he
characteiued them as robbers, by aesimitatmg
their supposed offenses to a seizure of the public
foils ai d aisenals—to a plundering of the public
lieasury, atm what is this but robbery or lar-
ci y, according to the circu instance of foice orno
force, m despoiling the Goveriii lent of its prop-
el tj
Mr Pi endent, we have a class of speculators I
cou d men iei, who are well known in the new
Sta e-., whj are, pel haps, justly obnoxious to the
ben uui's charge of pnacy, but they aie not the
preempt onei", or the squatters on the public
Knds,, who lave gone there without injury to
any one, for the puipose of providing homes for
themselves and children, and who expect to pay
a reasonable puce foi them as soon as they are
brought into ¡he market No, sir, it ¡s an antag
omst interest The hind pnates Í speak of are
certain gentlemen who make it their trade to go
about the countiy seeking whom they may de
voui—who visit this city, and the Other cities of
the Union, ¡ urchasmg up adverse claims to land
at a cheap rate, long since abandoned, and sup
posed to be woithlcss by their holders—buying
up old musty patents, for ten or twenty dollars
each, to lands that have been sold for taxes many
years ago, and long since passed ledemption, ay,
deal ng in all sorts of claims, which have color
enough to alarm the fears ot the bona fide settlei,
and foice him, rovever reluc antly, to the alter-
native of an unjust comoromise, or that whicn is
ii finitely worse, a couise of rumous litigation
Yes, Mr President, in this way stripp ng the
honest settler of his hard earnings, ao4 exposing
