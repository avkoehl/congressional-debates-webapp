Protection to American Industry—Mr. Hill.
Ho., of Reps.
to earn any wages at all, stand ready to fill up every
gap in the ranks of industry; and to the honest
laborer himself, standing on the edge of this line,
over which he is liable at any moment to be forced
into the ranksof pauperism, the anxiety and miser-
able state of uncertainty for himself and his family
must be fatal to all rational happiness, and is well
calculated to drivehim into vicious indigencies and
temporary excesses whenever a transient oppor-
tunity is afforded, as a momentary relief from a con-
dition of hopelejs misery.
"From the returns m.ade to the British Parlia-
ment as to pauperism in the month of September,
A. D. 1867, it appears that out of a population of
19,886,104, dwelling in the area for which the returns
are made, 872,620 persons were oq, the list of pau-
pers, supported by public charity, of which num-
ber 129,689 were in the work-houses, and 738,726 were
relieved in their own houses. This latter portion
constitutes the army which substantially regulates
the rate of wages for labor, as they are ready, to a
greater or less extent, to take any vacant place
which may offer itself. And this state of the case
exists not in mid-winter, but just after the close of
the harvest, and the returns show that the evil ia
an advancing one, as there is an increase of 27,521,
or three and three tenths per cent, in 1867 over
the corresponding week in 1866i And a study of the
tables which are hereunto annexed (Appendix H)
shows the largest rate of pauperism in the manu-
facturing and not in the agricultural districts/'
Mr. Hewitt further states that paupers re-
ceiving public relief in England are as many
as the children in the schools.
"By another parliamentary return, which is also
annexed, (Appendix I,) it appears that the aver-
age number of scholars attendant upon the schools
under Government inspection in the year 1866 was
871,309 in England and Wales, Showing this suggest-
ive fact, that the paupers receiving public relief
and the children receiving instruction in schools
aided by the public funds were about equal in num-
ber. This statement alone, if other evidence were
lacking, would serve to prove that the working
classes of Great Britain have not yet achieved the
position in point of education and social comfort to
which humanity is entitled. Nor can it be alleged
that this is due to any deficiency in the resources
provided by nature for the reward of industry. The
coal and iron-ore mines of England afford the most
magnificent fund to be found on the face of the
globe for the abundant remuneration of the capital
and labor engaged in their development, and every
class in the community, except the operatives them-
selves, have enjoyed a bountiful return for their
interest in this national endowment."
It is evident from this report that most of
this pauperism arises for want of proper pol-
icy on the part of the Government in develop-
ing their resources.
In Whitaker's Statistics of England I find the
county of Lancaster, the seat of the cotton
and other manufactures of England, which
includes Manchester and the other great man-
ufacturing towns, also Liverpool, its area is
1,219,221 acreSf and it spends annually on
paupers £1,299,168, over five dollars per
acre. As a rule, we pay one dollar where
the English manufacturer pays one shilling,
and the French manufacturer pays one franc;
hence we have few or no paupers.
I will quote no more. What has been given
will suffice, I trust, to convince the most
skeptical that it is no idle talk when we speak
of the pauperism of Europe; and were it not
but for the fact that there are many who will
not believe that there is pauperism to any
great extent in Europe, I would not have pre-
sented these painful facts of starvation and
death, which do not exist wiiere work is plenty
and good wages are paid. It is a .truthful
illustration that the free-trade policy carries
with it low wages but little work, and fills the
poor-houses and prisons and makes paupers
of thousands.
I for one, Mr. Speaker, never want to see
the time when our protective policy shall be
destroyed, our factories closed, the working
classes out of employ, and with low wages, no
work at that, pauperism and crime stalking
about through the land as in foreign countries.
No, sir, let us have well-paid labor by pro-
tecting our industries. The rapid increase of
the population of the country demands the
protection of labor, the husbanding of all our
resources, apd keeping our land from being
filled with paupers; for in the prosperity of our
workingmen exists the prosperity of our coun-
try. In the language of another:
"I believe in that comprehensive policy that
watches over the poor and lowly and takes care of
the interests of all the world; but, after all, I am
for the Republic of the United States, one and indi-
visible, and the people of the United States, before
any other country or any other people."
Out protective policy encourages immigra-
tion to our country from Europe, as will be
seen clearly iu the table below from Whitaker's
Statistics of England:
"Emigration, 1855<ol870.—Theconstantlyrecurring
seasons of trade depression, and consequent want of
employment for the working classes in the manufac-
turing and other districts of the United Kingdom,
have led to excessive emigration from the mother
country to the North American and Australian col-
onies. The United States have also absorbed large
numbers of our surplus population, espeoially from
Ireland, l'he following table affords statistics in

* Two years before the war.
It will be seen by the above the emigra-
tion from England to us in 1858 and 1859,
when the free-trade tariffof 1857 was in force,
was 130,019; and in 1869 and 1870, when our
present system of protection was in full force,
399,076. it is, therefore, plainly manifest that
protection encourages immigration to the coun-
try. This is what we want, and we welcome
all from foreign lands. We have plenty of
room and to spare, a home for all; work
plenty, and fair prices paid for labor; and I
hope those who seek homes here will come to
make good citizens, and stand by and sustain
the protective policy of the United States, lest
+ Two years after the war.
if this policy fail, the same want and suffering
be found in this country as now exist in other
lands.
"The area of the United States, land and water,
is 1,466,000,000 acres, of which there is improved
189,000,000, say eight per cent., nnd only twenty per
cent, is in farms of any kind. While this fractional
portion of our territory only is employed, the agri-
cultural products of 1869, as appears by the census,
wero §2,445,000,000—a sum equal to the national
debt."
This is the country to which we welcome
all from every clime ; and the above shows the
great extent and resources of this country.
There is a farm of eighty acres of laud for
every one, free to all, without money and with-
out price, who will settle on it under the home-
stead laws of the United States. The masses
of the American people are the best fed, the
best clothed, the best educated, and the mos,t
comfortable in their homes of any people on
the face of the earth, and they invite the peo-
ple of other nations to come and partake with
them in the enjoyment of these blessings.
This country should encourage immigration in
order to fill up our vast States and Territories,
and build up the waste places yet undeveloped.
Protection stimulates immigration, and this
policy continued will help materially to. popu-
late the country.
Protection has added untold wealth to thp
people of this country. The great growth and
rapid progress of our country the past few
years, the building of the numerous railroads,,
employing so many thousands of hands in the
building and running them, may in most part
be attributed to the protective policy of the
Government, in making us a prosperous and
wealthy people. One of the greatest evidences
of the wealth and prosperity of our country
under the system of protection is to be found
in the great inorease of the number of savings'
banks and deposits in them the last few yeac s.
These are the places where the working people
deposit their savings. They indicate the pros-
perity of the laboring classes.
In Massachusetts, in 1861-62, the savings
banks numbered ninety-three, with 248,900
depositors and $50,403,674 of deposits, being
an average of $202 50 to each depositor. In
1869-70 they had increased in number to one
hundred and thirty-one, with 431,769 depos-
itors and $112,119,016 of deposits, averaging
$259 67 to each depositor. m
In the State of .New York, in 1861-62, the
depositors in such institutions numbered 242,-
945, with $51,861,848 of deposits, being an
average of $213 to each individual; and in
the year 1870 the number of depositors had
increased to 651,474, and the deposits to
$194,360,217, or $298 to each depositor. This
aggregate a"d pro rata gain shows the steadily
increasing wealth and prosperity of the coun-
try under the fostering impulses of the pro-
tective system.
These workingmen have on deposit now
about $400,000,000 in the savings' banks of
the country.
Protection has also made prosperous the
farmer and tillers of the soil, which, by the
ready market afforded them by home consump-
tion of their products, has tended greatly to
benefit the agricultural interests of the country..
It has been well said, the prosperity of the
American farmer always must depend on the
steady employment of the American miner,
artisan, and laborer, at such wages as will
enable them and their families to be free con-
sumers of the productions of thefield, orchard,
and dairy. With the clear perception of this
truth, that at least in the United States the
prosperity of the farmer is dependent on that
of the manufacturer, and the prosperity of the
manufacturer equally dependent on that of the
farmer; that in this there is no conflict, butaa
absolute harmony of interests between them
applicable to this subject, I quote from the
speech ofHon. Alexander (i. Cattell, delivered
in the United States Senate on the 22d Jan-
uary, 1867. He remarked:
"But, Mr. President, the harmony of interests
whieh exists between agriculture and manufactures,
and the truth oftheposition I have taken, are clearly
shown by actual results* I am sure tho Senate will
excuse me if I draw an illustration from personal
observation in my own mercantile life. Twenty
years ago Iftsfc autumn I embarked in the trade in
breadstuifs in the city of Philadelphia. At that time,
ami for some succeeding years, tho entire volume of
my business was made up of consignments of agri-
cultural produets from the valleys of the Susque-
hanna, the Juniata, and the Lehigh. I have not the
figures at command, but I am sure I speak within
baiiads when I say that my own house and the four
