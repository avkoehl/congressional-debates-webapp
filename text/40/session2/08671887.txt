INDIAN APPROPRIATIONS.

desire to take up now with a view of referring
it to the Committee on Appropriations, so that

important that it should be acted on immedi-
ately. I move, therefore, to take up House

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill is

Whole. It has been read.
Mr. GRIMES. Let it be read again.
The Secretary read the bill.
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. Prqfldent, it is to me
a relief to rise to address'-Wiyself to topics
which are not calculated in any way to excite
solicitude or to create alarm. The bill upon
your table looks only to the promotion of the
interest and prosperity of the country. It has
no political bearing except that in its conse-
quences it may tend to cement the Union and
add to the wealth of the nation. And I will
proceed as briefly as I can to state why, in my
opinion, the measure before you should be
adopted.
It is not many years since Congress deter-
mined, as I think, in the spirit of a wise and en-
larged policy, to establish a connection by rail-
road between the Atlantic and the Pacific. At
first the project itself was considered Utopian.
I speak from knowledge that when it was first
agitated many of the best men in the Senate
at that time, long before 1862, recently after^
we obtained California, deemed it altogether
impracticable. They .thought, in the first place,
that it could not be accomplished at all; in the
next place, that if it could be accomplished it
would be an expenditure which would seriously
involve the Government. But the people took
a different view of it, and they soon imparted
their spirit to their Representatives, and the
result was the passage of the act of 1862. It
was a great measure; great in every aspect in
which it can bo viewed. It was great in its
political consequencesâ€”consequences not at
all connected with anything of party which
could distract us, but consequences which re-
ferred themselves exclusively to the wealth,
prosperity, and continuance of the Union.
Having determined upon the measure, the next
thing to be decided was where should the main
trunk of this great channel commence. There
were various plans; but they all finally resolved
themselves into fixing it at the one hundredth
meridian. The obvious object of placing it so far
west was that the benefit of the improvement
should be as widely dispersed as was practicable,
so that all the parts of the United States might
participate in its advantages. We had a north-
ern interest; avast population at the North,
full of enterprise, capable of opening for them-
selves and their country immense wealth;
patriotic ; and they were to be accommodated.
Their section was dotted over with cities, then
comparatively of great magnitude, but destined,
as it was obvious, to become of still greater
magnitude. We had what was called a central
interest that involved Missouri and Kansas and
several States which were to become important
and potential States of the Union
They were to be accommodated, and they
were cared for. We had a southern interest
and they were to be taken care of. The first
tiling that was done when the act of 1862 was
passed was for the several State Legislatures
of the States to which 1 have referred to pass
acts of incorporation by which the roads incor-
porated would be able with facility to make a
junction with the main trunk, so as each to
enjoy in part all the benefits of the great enter-
prise. It was, however, an enterprise of such
magnitude that all saw that it could not be
accomplished by individual means. It was, in
the true sense of the term, a national under-
taking pregnant with national benefit; and as
it could not be accomplished by means of pri-
vate wealth the nation in a spirit of enlarged
policy determined to come to its aid and it was
done. It was done by providing two means of
aid; first, by giving to each of these companies
a portion of the public lands through which the
roads were to pass; and, next, at the same time
giving them subsidies in the form of bonds of
the Government.
Looking at the legislation of that day, its
general purpose, without now taking up the
particular provisions of the laws, it is obvious
to my mind that it was the purpose of Congress
that all of those three several channels which
were to connect themselves with the main chan-
nel, that is to say, the main trunk at the one
hundredth meridian, should be equally assisted
