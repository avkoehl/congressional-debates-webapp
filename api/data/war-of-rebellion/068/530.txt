HDQRS. SECOND CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 8, 1864-6.30 a.m.

General MEADE:

The provost guard of the Fifth Corps is just crossing the plank road, and is halting now from some obstacle in front. I judge it may be an hour before it will pass my left, to enable me to even think of commencing a march.

Very respectfully,WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, May 8, 1864-7.30 [a.m.]

Colonel C. H. MORGAN,

Chief of Staff:

Everything quiet. The enemy still show themselves at the breast-work. The head of General Mott's division at the cross-roads moving on. General Mott has sent out his pioneers to bury our dead, of which there is a large number in the rear of our picket-line. They will fall in the rear of the column and destroy all arms still remaining in the road.

Colonel Schoonover, field officer Fourth Division, has just stated that he advanced the right of his line within sight of the Germanna plank road. Saw nothing except an occasional cavalry picket. The last brigade, Fourth Division, halted at the cross-roads. An occasional picket seen in our front-that is, on the plank road.

Commanding Second Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to inform you that General Burnside has been directed to take position as near to Alrich's as the trains in that vicinity will admit to cover them. General Sedgwick has been ordered to leave a division at Piney Branch Church, to put one at the point designated for his corps in yesterday's orders, and the remaining division half way between the two. Headquarters to-day will be at Piney Branch Church.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

P. S.-As soon as you can dispense with them please send Fifth New York Cavalry to these headquarters, Second Ohio and Twenty-second New York to General Burnside.
