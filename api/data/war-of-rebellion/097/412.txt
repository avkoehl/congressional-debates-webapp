HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, April 1, 1865-1.30 a.m.

General MILES:

In case your wagons cannot be got out of the way, you will be obliged to modify your line from what is directed in the accompanying order,* so as to include the wagons, for awhile at any rate. Let me know, for Mott must modify his line if you have to yours.

Very respectfully,C. A. WHITTIER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Lieutenant Colonel C. A. WHITTIER,Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Corps:

COLONEL: I have advanced and occupied the works held last night by the Fifth Corps, the Third Brigade on the right, the Fourth in center, and the First on the left. The Second Brigade will be moved up in rear of the left flank. My right is near where it rested last night. My left brigade at the White Oak road with its left refused. Have sent party of twenty-five men down the White Oak road to communicate with the cavalry or whatever may be there. The enemy occupy their picket-line in front of their line of works. The firing is now between the skirmishers. The Third Division connects on my right in a thin line, and I would suggest that fires be built along it to make the enemy think we have a strong line. Division headquarters are in rear of Second Brigade, in large open field and near White Oak road. I would like a small party of mounted men as a patrol to keep up communication with the cavalry if I succeed in opening it.

NELSON A. MILES,

Brevet Major-General.
