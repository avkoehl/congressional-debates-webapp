206                                          APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                           [February 14,
25th Cong....3d Sess.
tor I hat e studied them with care I will read a
few extracts from the Vnginia resolutions The
Gene-al Assembly, m the third resolution,
' Doth explicitly and peremptorily declare, that it views
the povvtrs of the Federal Government as resulting from
the compact, to which the States are parties, as limited by
the plain sense and intention of the instrument constituting
that compact, and as no lurther valid than they are author
ized by the grants, enumerated m that compact '
And in the fourth íesoluüon they express their
deep regret
" That a spirit has, in sundry instances, been manifested
by the Federal Government to enlarge its powers by forced
constructions ot the constitutional charter winch defines
them "
In regard to the sedition law, they declare that
its passage was the exercise of
" A power not delegated by the Constitution, but, on the
contrary, expressly and positively forbidden by one of the
amendments thereto , a power which, more than any other,
ought to prodvee universal alarm, because it is leveled
against that right of freely examining public characters and
measures, and of free communication among the people
thereon, which has ever been justly deemed the only effect
ual guardian of every other right."
Now, sir, what is the essence, what is the root
of all these resolutions ' It consistsof one plain,
clear, fundamental principle, liara which all others
pioceed as blanches It is this that patriotism
—that the permanence of oui institutions—that
oil the principles of coirect constiuction requite
that the IYderal Government shall be limited to
the express powers granted to it by the States,
and that no implied powers shall ever be exer-
cised, except such as are evidently and plainly
necessary to carry the express powers into effect
This is the foundation, the coinerstone, the vital
principle of all the Virginia and Kentucky reso-
lutions It was because the sedition law violated
this punctple that the republican statesmen of
Vnginia and Kentucky opposed it with such a
dctcimined spirit It was, as Mr Madison says
in his report, because such a loose construction
of the Constitution as would bring this law within
its pale, would lay the foundation from which
llie fi lends of a sttong centinl Government might
proceed to rob the States and the people of their
lbcities, and establish a consolidated Govein
nont. It was the fust stnde towiuds a limited
nonaichy
The Ft dcraltsts of that day honestly believed
that the Government should b( stiengthenod at
the center, and that the pulsations ot the heait
weie not poweiful enough to extend a wholesome
circulation to the extiemilies They, thciefoie,
used every effort to enlirge the powers of tin
Ttdcral Govunnv nt by coiibtitiction Tins was
the touchstone which then divided parties, and
which will continue to divide them until, which
God foibid, the Government itself shall cease to
exist
Now, sir, if I have correctly stated the princi
pie which runs through nil the Vngmm and Ken
tucky resolutions, I would ask whether the bill
now befoie the Senate is not a more palpable vi
olation of this principle than the sedition law 1
shall now proceed to establish this position
In the fust place, then, the sedition 1 iw did not
interfere with the fieedom of spoi ch   The citizen
might speak what ho thought, and say what he
pleased, without subjecting himself to its p< nal-
ties     TJndei the despotisms of Europe theie is a
strict censorship over  the  piess      Eveiythmg
written Fot publication must undcigo the supct
vision and correction of a Government censor be
fore it can be published     In the most despotic
countries, however, some indulgence is gi anted
to the liberty of speech on political questions
The bill establishes more than a univeisal con
sorship over the freedom of speech     It compels
the officer to be silent altogether on political ques
tions     He dare not utter a woi d without incur
ring its penalties     In this country, every public
question connects itself with our elections     If
there be two candidates for any State Legislature,
and the election should turn upon internal im
provements, or the division of a county, the of-
ficer is as much exposed to the univeral sweep of
this bill, in case he utteis a word m favor of the
one oi against the othei, as though it were the
presidential election     Ht, is equally doomed to
silence in the one  case as in the other     Such
tyranny is unknown to the sedition law.
Interference in Elections—Mr. Buchanan.
Whilst I was abroad, some years ago, I heard
an anecdote highly cieditable to the King of Prus- |
sia, who, although a despot, is, by his subjects, i
called a Democratic King    The revolutionary I
war of Poland against Russia was then raging,
and the Polish sublets of the Pi ussian King wei e
highly excited in favor of their brethten under
the dominion of Russia   They talked vci y freely
in favor of taking pait in the contest, of casting j
off the Pi ussian  yoke, and  uniting with their
brethien in reestablishing the independence of
Poland    The counselors of the King advised him  .
to prohibit and punish this freedom of speech, ho  |
answered that he would do no such thing, that
he would suffer them to express their opinions,
and that there was less danger that they would
rise against his Government than if they remained
silent   This was the remark of a liberal and wise
man, who had been instructed in the school of
adversity
But, in this favored land of liberty, m the nine-
teenth centuiy, we are about to deny to oui citi-
zens the privilege of speaking their thoughts
This is the firstattempt which I haveeverknown
or rpad of, either in England oi this country, to
punish the expiession of opinions relative to can
didatesfor office asa ciime Ifcvei this was done
in England, even m the reigns of the Tudois or
theStuaits, it must have been a Star Chamber
off nse In the more enlightened despotisms of
Europe they will learn, with astonishment, that
a bill has been introduced into the Senate of the
United States proposing to punish a postmaster
for expressing his opinion in favor of a candidate
for office, as if tlm were an enormous ciime, with
a fine of live hundred dollars, and a perpetual dis-
ability to hold any other office under the Govern
ment Even under the common law of England,
oral blander is not punishable as a cume The
paity injured by it is left to his private remedy
In the second place, the sedition law,although
it did abiidge, did not, like this bill, totally de-
stioy the lieedom of the piess The sedition
law depuvpd no man of the right oi tht power,
in the iiist instance, to wiiu and publish to the
wotld any stiictuies upon the Govtrnment which
he might think piopei To be sui<, if, in c\er
cismg this puvikge, hi viol tted the tiuth, he
was mule íesponsible to its jxiiultits This bill ¡
íeicliLS tin voiy fountains of thought Its ob '
ject is to picvent its victims fiom speaking ot
wiitingntall IN o m tttei how innocent, oi praise
worthy, oi true, may be the conversation oi the
publication, still if it can be construed into nn
uulcavor to peisuudc any ehctoi to give his
vote for a particular candidate, he is doomed to
a fine of j^Ol), and a perpetual disability to hold
oil ice
Agtin undei the sedition law, the accused was
pernultid to protect hims If «gainst its penalties,
by giving the tiuth of his cluuge in rv idence
Any individual who had accused the President
of the United St ttes of being a bad and dangerous
man, who was aiming a blow at the hbeities of
his countiy,and desired to usuipthe powers of I
the Government by a latitudinal nn constiuction
of the Constitution, was piotected by this law
fiom all responsibility, provided he could prove
the truth of these allegations to the satisfietion
of a court and jury of his countrymen Not so
the present bill If a postmaster, or a land offi-
cer, or a weigher, ot a gauger, should endeavor
to dissuade any elector fiom voting for a paittc-
tilar candidate, and should say that this candidate
has been guiltv of a crime, and theiefoie his elec '
tion would be dangerous to the countiy, and is I
brought bcfoio a couit and jury for trial under
this bill, he must be conuctcd, although he may
be able to prove the truth of his chaige by evi
dence as clear as a sunbeam The old English
maxim, "the greater the tiulh the greater the
libel," is again revived, with some show of rea-
son , because the language of truth would be more
powerful in persuading or dissuading an elector
than that of falsehood Although every member I
of the court and the juiy might peisonally know
that what the accused had uttered was the tiuth,
yet, under the piovisions of this bill, they would
be bound to convict and sentence him to suffer
its penalties
I think I have thus established my position, that i
Senate.
this bill is worse, and more glaringly unconstitu-
tional, than the sedition law
I now appioach the argument of the Senator
from Virginia in favor of the constitutionality of
this bill The old argument in favor of the sedi-
tion law, as stated by Mi Madison in his report,
was that the general phrases in the preamble and
one clause in the Constitution, were sufficiently
poweiful to extend the limited grants of power
contained in the body of the instrument, and to
confer upon Congress the auihouty to enact any
law they might think piopcr for the common de-
fense and the general welfare This doctime has
long since been exploded, and was not adveited
to by the Senatoi from Virginia We are in-
formed, by the same authority, that another ar-
gument used was, that all the State Legislatures
had passed laws for the punishment of libels, and
that, therefore, the same power belonged to the
Government of the United States A similar
argument could not be urged by the Senatoi m
support of this bill, because no State Legislature
ever has, and I will venture to say no State
Legislature ever will pass such a bill as that now
befoie the Senate To what argument then did
the Senator resoit' I shall endeavor to state it
fanly He asks, tf a judge were to use the free-
dom of speech oi of the press in canvassing the
merits of vcause before the people, which it would
become his duty afterwards to decide, would it
be an abridgment of this fieedom to punish him
for such conduct' I answei, ceitainly not But
does not the gentleman perceive that the offense
in this case is substantive and independent, and
amounts to a total violation of his official duty,
foi which he ought to be impeached ' The lan-
guage, oral or printed, which he has used, is the
meie agent which he has employed in the com-
mission of the offense This argument is a beg-
ging of the question, for it assumes that, under
the Constitution, Congress possesses the power
to punish one citizen for persuading another, by
fan aigument, to give his vote for or against any
candidate for office This is the very principle
to be established
Agun he asks, suppose one of the officers em-
biaced by the bill weie to use the freedom of
speech or of the piess, in saying to an elector, if
you will give your vote foi such a candidate, I
will piocure \ou an office would not such an
officer be punishable' I answer, certainly he
would, under the State laws, because this would
be an attempt to piocure a vote by corrupt and
improper means It is a distinct offense, the pun-
ishment of which in no manner inteiferes with
the liberty of speech or the press when exercised
to accomplish constitutional purposes A ¡simi-
lar answer might be given to his interrogatory
m legard to giving a challenge, by woid or
by writing, to fight a duel The last question,
which capped the climax of his aigument, was,
if a man be guilty of a false and malicious libel
against an innocent person, may you not punish
him, under the Constitution, without invading
the fieedom of speech or the press, because it is
not the words he may use which you punish,
but the falsehood of the charge, the evil inten-
tion, and the injury inflicted ' I ask the Senator
if this argument is not a justification of the sedi-
tion law to the fullest extent' I have taken
down the Senator's words, and cannot be mis-
taken in their meaning What did the sedition
law declaie ' That the authors of " false, scan-
dalous, and malicious" libels, with the evil inten-
tions enumerated in the act, should incur its pen-
alties It was not the mere words published that
were punished, but it was their falsehood, their
malice, and their evil intention The constitu-
tionality of the sedition law is, therefore, em-
braced not only within the spirit, but within the
very words, of the Senator's argument Pías he
not, however unconsciously, defended the sedi-
tion law' This argument, to my knowledge,
never occurred to those who passed that law,
but it is one which, if well founded, would give
us the power to mortow to pass another sedition
law-
Do not Senators perceive that the passage of
this bill would utterly disfranchise a large and
respectable class of our people' Under it, what
would be the condition of all the editois of your
