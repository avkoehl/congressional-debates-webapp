Mississippi River. Bands of deserters and jayhawkers are infesting the country north of Red River and between the Black and Mississippi Rivers. I have ordered Lieutenant Griffin with a detachment of cavalry into that section of country. The ratio of rise at the mouth of Red River has declined to three inches in twenty-four hours. A great flood from the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers is pouring into the Ohio, but on the 7th instant the river was falling at Saint Louis. On the lakes and lower Teche al is quiet. The pickets report no accumulation of supplies at Brashear City, and that the garrison consists of two regiments, negro troops, and 250 white artillerists of an Indiana Regiment. A few days ago 250 negro troops crossed Berwick Bay and came up the railroad track about a couple of miles for the purpose of destroying a bridge over Black Bayou, which was falsely reported to the enemy as having been rebuilt, and then recrossed to Brashear City. I send you a New Orleans paper of 13th instant sent me by Captain Murphy, commanding Lower Teche.

Yours, respectfully,

J. L. BRENT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

(Same to Captain J. G. Clarke, assistant adjutant-general.)

General MAGRUDER,

Commanding District of Arkansas, Lewisville, Ark.:

General Smith has received telegram from Camden reporting the movement of enemy. He has ordered Missouri troops not to move for the present. Wishes all cavalry in readiness to move if found necessary. He believes the move of enemy but a demonstration preceding movement in force from below.

General Smith means only to suspend the movement of the Missouri brigade now at Camden, as has been telegraphed to General Parsons, not of other troops.

Major General STERLING PRICE:

MY DEAR GENERAL: I thought till last evening that there was no doubt about my going to Richmond. General Smith told me last night that while he thought I would be of service in effecting the object of the mission to Richmond, it was not essential that I should go, as it had been determined to send Major Burton, and that he would not order me to go unless I desired it. I do not desire it and shall therefore remain. Major Burton starts in the morning for Lewisville, and will call to see you. He says he will be glad to have Mr. Barr accompany him, and that he will call to see you and will take great pleasure in carrying your letters and doing anything in his power for you in
