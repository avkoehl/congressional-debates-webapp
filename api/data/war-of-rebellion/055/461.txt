commanders. Brig. General W. P. Carlin, commanding the First Brigade, ably assisted by Colonel B. F. Scribner, Thirty-eighth Regiment Indiana Volunteers, exhibited the same cool courage and daring which characterized his conduct at Perryville, Stone's River, and Chickamauga. I thank him for his valuable advice and services, and congratulate him on his achievements. Colonel W. L. Stoughton, Eleventh Regiment Michigan Volunteers, commanding Second Brigade; Colonel M. F. Moore, Sixty-ninth Ohio Volunteers, commanding left wing, and Major J. R. Edie, Fifteenth Infantry, U. S. Army, commanding right wing,were very efficient in the discharge of their duties; great praise is due to them.

A small battalion of the Fifteenth U. S. Infantry,never under fire before, acted like veterans.

The Fifteenth Regiment Kentucky Volunteers, on post duty, was not engaged. Its colonel, Marion C. Taylor, joined me and acted as a staff officer. I am greatly indebted to him for his valuable assistance. He was at all times ready and willing to carry orders to any part of the field. He is a brave and gallant officer, worthy of promotion.

Major Fitch, Captain Waggener, Lieutenants Morris, Lowe, Kessler, and Smith, and Surgeon Miller, of my staff, were prompt and efficient. Their gallantry was conspicuous on all occasions calling it forth. The hope for glory and distinction will account for the gallantry of officers, but how can we thank too much the private soldier who faces death without hope of future reward?

Every officer and soldier did his duty, and I regret not being able to submit the name of every man in the division in this report in order that others may honor those to whom honor is justly due.
