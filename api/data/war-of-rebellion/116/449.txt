ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, April 13, 1862.

Captain C. H. McNALLY, Detroit, Mich.:

The regular troops at Detroit being on parole cannot properly guard the prisoners of war ordered to be sent to Fort Mackinac and therefore one of the companies at Detroit will not move to that place. Are there any volunteers at or near Detroit from which a company could be taken to guard the prisoners and garrison Fort Mackinac? Answer immediately. If the prisoners arrive at Detroit before the other troops are there request the civil authorities to take charge of them until the arrival of troops.

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

BALTIMORE, MD., April 13, 1862.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

There are some eight or ten prisoners of war at Fort Deleware who say that they were forced into the service of the insurgents who wish to remain at the North and wh are anxious to take oath of allegiance.
