These guns have been tried by officers in whom I have confidence, and I should be glad to have your order them for this army as early as practicable.

I applied for these guns during Mr. Cameron's administration, but could not get them.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

McCLELLAN'S HEADQUARTERS, June 22, 1862-1.30 p.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Some sharp attempts of the enemy last evening and night to drive in Hooker's pickets. They certainly failed and were driven back, with what loss we cannot tell. Our loss 1 killed and 4 wounded. Nothing else of interest. Intercepted letters state that Beauregard was expected in Richmond a few days since.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

WAR DEPARTMENT, June 22, 1862-4.30 p.m.

Major General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:

James is not known as a manufacturer of guns, and it is not known that he makes any pretention to having invented one. Ames, of Chicopee, manufactures guns, and is the manufacturer of James' projectile, about the merits of which there are conflicting reports, and the purchase of which you declined to recommend last spring. You will recollect that these are the guns and projectiles bought last summer by the State of Illinois at an extravagant price, the job creating great scandal. Where are the guns to which your telegraph refers? There is no proposal for their sale on the files of this Department. Who has offered them to you?

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

McCLELLAN'S, June 22, 1862-5.30 p.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

In my dispatch of to-day I omitted to ask you to have the proper amount of ammunition ordered with the James guns. If the guns are sent the ammunition must be procured from General James, as it is peculiar.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
