GRAHAMVILLE, January 3, 1865.

Major-General McLAWS:

Reliable scouts report at least two divisions of enemy's infantry on this side the river and steam-boats were constantly crossing from Savannah to Screven's Ferry on yesterday. Scouts also report a pontoon laid from Pennyworth's Island to South Carolina bank at Cheves' place. A scout, who was an overseer and thoroughly acquainted on all the rice plantations, went through the swamps to within half a mile of Cheves' place; saw a close column of infantry half a mile long pass from the landing up Cheves' causeway toward Screven's Ferry road; also a small force of infantry appeared at Izard's place.
