question of the disuibuuuriol wealth, a question least explured,

Such were my •sentiments,, delivered four jears
since, on the question ot the removal of tho tlepo-
s.'es, ami now stand,nt; on recoid, and I now call
youi attention, Senator*, while they are íiesh m
your minds, and before other extracts are lead, to
the opinions I then entertained and expressed, m
order that you may corapate them with ihose that
I have expresses!, and the course I have pursued,
on the piesent occasion In the first place, I then
expressed myself explicitly and decidtdlv igaitist
the banking system, and intimated, in language
too strong to be mistaken, that, it the question was
then bank or no bank, as it no-v is, as iai as &o-
x'ernment is concerned, I would not be found on ¡
the side of the bank. Row, Í ask, I appeal to the
candor of all, even the most prejudiced, is mete auy
thm^ tn all this contradictory to my present opi-
ri ons or course1 On the contrary, having eutu-
tamed and expressed these opinions, could 1, at this
time, when the issue I then supposed is actually
presented, have gone against the separation with-
out gross inconsistency1 Again, I then declared
Myself to be uttsrly opposed to a combination or
league of State banks, as being the most inefficient
and corrupting fiscal agent the Government coaH
select, and more objectionable than a Bank of the
United States. I again appeal, is there a senti-
ment or a word m all this contradictory to what I
have said or done on the present occasion?   So far
otherwise, is here not a perfect haimony and coin-
cidence throuKhont, winch, considering the dis-
tance of time and the difference of the occasion, is
tiuly remarkable, and this extending to all the
gieat and governing questions now at issne1
But the removal of the deposites was not the
only question discussed at that remarkable and im-
portant session. The charter of the United Slates
Bank was then about to expire The Senator from
Massachusetts neatest to me, [Mr. Webster,]
tht n at the head of the Committee on Finance,
suggested, in his place, that he intended to intro-
duce a bill to renew the chatter. I clearly per-
ceived that ihe movement, if made, would ia.il,
and that theie was no ptosptct of doing any thing
to ane- t the d.uigei I saw appioachine;, unless the
subject was taken up on the btnad question of the
currencj, and tli.tt if any oontisetion uf the Go-
vernment uuh the hanks could be justibtd .vt all,
it mu t be in that it lutio i I din not among those
w ho belies e that the c n luioy w ts m a omul cun-
di'.on when the dtposit,>. were removed m 1834.
I thou believed, and experience has proved I was
eorieet, th.n it was deeply and dangerously dis-
eased, and that the most elluient measuies weie

I ocriipif d, wh'Ch I did, fully and explicitly, m the
speech! delivered on the occasion Injustice to
mj t If, I ought to have every word of it read on
ih  pitsenloccasi n It would of itself be a full
vindication of my course I stated and enlarged
on i ' tin points to which I hive aheady referred,
ohjK led lo mc lecharter as proposed by the mover,
ami foretold (hat what has since happened would
follow, unless something effectual was done to pre-
vent it As a remedy, I proposed to use the Bank
of the United States as a temporary expedient, for-
tified with strong guard , in order to resist and turn
back the swelling tide of circulation With this
view; I proposed to prohibit the tssae of afty note
under ten dollars, at first, andmfter a certain inter-
val, under twenty, and to refuse to receive the notes
of any bank that issued notes under five dollars, or
that received the notes of any bank that issued less,
m order to make a total separation between the
banks that should refuse to discontinue the issue of
small notes, and the others, in the hope that the in-
fluence of the latter, with the voice of the commu-
nity, would ultimately compel a discontinuance.
I proposed that the charter, with these and other
piovisions that might be devised by a committee
appointed for the purpose, should be renewed for
twelve years, two jears longer than the Bank of
England had been, in order to avail ourselves of the
experience and wisdom of that great and enlightened
nation. All this I proposed, expressly on the
ground of undoing the system, gradiislly and s! )v-
ly, till a total disconnection should be eilecteu, if
experience should show that it could be carried *o
that extent My object was double, to get clear t f
the system, and to avoid the catastrophe which his
since befallen us, and which I then saw was ap-
pioachtng.
To piove all this, I a°am refer to the lecord. If
it shall appear fiom it thai my object was to discon-
nect the Government gradually and cautiously from
the banking sjstem, and with that view, and that
only, I proposed lo use the United States Bank for
a short time, and that I explicitly expressed the
same opinions then, as I now have, on almost eve-
ry point connected with the system, 1 shall not only
have vindicated my eharactei from ihe charge of
the Senator from Kentucky, but shall do more,
much more-show that I did all an individual, stand-
ing alone as I did, could do toaveit the present ca-
lamities, and, ol course, I am fice from all respon-
sibility for what has since happened. I have shor-
tened the iiuti Is, as far as was possible to do my-
sclt justice, and hive lett out much that ought, ot
ngbl, to be lead in my defence, rithc than to wea-
r) the Senate I know how difficult it is to com-
mand attention to leading of documents, but I trust
that this, win le justice to a member of the body,
whose character has been assailed without the least
provocation, will form an exception The extracts
are numbered, and I will thank the Secretary to
pause at the end of each, unless otherwise desued.
The Secretary here read the following extract.
"After a full suivcyoftho whole sublet t, I see none lean

After having so expressed rnjself, which clearly
■■hows that my object was to usf the bank for a

wi'h the system, wi1 out a sh ck to the country or

ruiewal of the chaitct of the Ji.ueü States Bank,
or through a league of State banks After con-
cluding what I had to say on the subjtct, in my
deep solicitude I addressed the three parties m the
Senate sepaiately, urging such motives as I thought
be't calculated to act on them, and pressing them
to join rnc in the measure suggested, m oider to
avert approaching danger. I began with my
friends of the State Rights party and with the Ad-
lmmstiation. I have taken copious extracts from
the address to the first, which will clearly prove
how exactly my opinion then and now coincide
on all questions connected with the banks. I now
ask the Secretary to read the extract numbered two.
