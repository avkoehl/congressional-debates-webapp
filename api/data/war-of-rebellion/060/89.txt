General BARTON, or

COMMANDING GENERAL IN FRONT OF NEW BERNE:

GENERAL; I have received your dispatch of 5 p. m. yesterday, telling me General Pickett wishes me to cut and hold the railroad. I informed you by courier last night that I had taken this place and burnt the railroad bridge. I should have left this morning on my return but for your last dispatch. My situation here is very precarious if the enemy should throw re-enforcements into Morehead City. I have sent out scouting parties in every direction this morning. From my information I am hardly able to take Morehead City, and a failure would injure me more than not making the attempt. Please keep me informed at least once a day of the state of affairs. You did not say in this dispatch whether you were still to join the main attack and thus leave my rear exposed. In one received two hours before, without hour, day, or place being named, you had said you were to join the main attack.

Yours, respectfully,

J. G. MARTIN,

Brigadier-General.
