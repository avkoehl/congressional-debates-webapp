MONTGOMERY, February 19, 1864.

Lieutenant-General POLK:

Just reached here. The head of my column will be here to-morrow. Where shall it go? I have been ordered to re-enforce you. Shall I ask for transportation from General Johnston? None has been ordered. If so, where shall I direct it to go?

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.

EIGHT MILES EAST OF LAUDERDALE,

February 19, 1864-8 a. m.

Lieutenant-General POLK:

Enemy apparently waiting quietly in Meridian and vicinity preparing for a mover or waiting for raid from above. Their destination is still uncertain. My entire command except Perrin is moving to meet raid.

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.

The line not working. Have to send by courier.

OPERATOR.

MOBILE, February 19, 1864.

Lieutenant General L. POLK:

Major Cummins just returned from Quitman. Reports enemy (about 1,000 or 1,200 strong) to have left Quitman on Wednesday evening to return to Enterprise. They stated to the people that they destroyed bridges to prevent forces from Mobile interfering with their pursuit of Loring, whom they hoped to catch at Demopolis. That the attack on Fort Powell is a feint to detain troops here. Cantey's brigade is now at Bucatunna. I sent him there on the 17th to check raid or detain advance of enemy. I think Farragut will endeavor to reduce Fort Powell to open Grant's Pass and to get possession of the lower bay. The weather has prevented a renewal of his attack. Only four boats can go up the Tombigbee in addition to those already there. All sugar and cotton from Enterprise in shipping order has been saved. Some sugar has already been shipped to Montgomery. First Alabama has arrived.

D. H. MAURY,

Major-General.

MOBILE, February 19, 1864.

Lieutenant-General POLK:

Farragut has not renewed his attack on Grant's Pass. His fleet lies off the pass in the sound. Weather too bad for action. Sherman's corps not advancing down Mobile and Ohio Road. No landing has yet been reported in direction [of] Pascaqoula.

D. H. MAURY,

Major-General, Commanding.
