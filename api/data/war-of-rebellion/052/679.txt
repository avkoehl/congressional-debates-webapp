HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS, Chickamauga Creek, near Gower's, September 16, 1863.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD,Chief of Staff:

SIR: I inclose you copy of communication from Colonel Minty; also copy of my order* to Major Seibert to report to Colonel Minty with the Seventh Pennsylvania, as I think I can do without it in this front and it may save other troops. I think Colonel Minty's a very good letter.

Respectfully,

T. L. CRITTENDEN,

Major-General, Commanding.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,Twenty-first Army Corps:

SIR: Last night my patrol ran foul of the enemy's pickets at a little less than 3 miles from here on the Ringgold road. Shortly after daybreak this morning the pickets reported the enemy advancing in force, and they were attacked immediately after. I reenforced them, and they in turn drove the rebels back. I think there was nothing but a strong scout. A force of about 200 is now threatening me from the direction of Leet's. I have sent a squadron to disperse them.

The force at Ringgold is, I believe, Scott's brigade. Pegram is at Leet's, with an outpost at Pea Vine Church. There is a good road running down the valley between Pea Vine Ridge and the Chickamauga, which exposes my rear to attack. Can you post a brigade of infantry at Reed's Bridge. As I am now situated I may be forced to retreat at any moment. I wish this could be avoided.

If I send a patrol toward Leet's, it is liable to be cut off by an advance from Ringgold. If I move on Ringgold, I am liable to be attacked in rear from Leet's. However, if I had all of my brigade, here, I could guard all the roads and punish the rebels if they made any demonstrations against me.

Can you not send me the Seventh Pennsylvania and have the Third Indiana ordered up from Chattanooga? I am not strong enough for the position I am placed in. I think, without doubt, that Longstreet is in this part of the country. I doubt his being at Dalton.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. H. G. MINTY,

Colonel, Commanding.
