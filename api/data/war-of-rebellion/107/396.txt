It is the desire of the War Department in relinquishing the services of this gallant regiment to make known the satisfaction that is felt at the prompt and patriotice manner in which it responded to the call for men to defend this capital when it was believed to have been in peril, and to acknowledge the important service which it rendered by appearing here in an hour of dark and trying necessity.

The time for which it had engaged to serve has now expired. The service which it was expected to perform has been handsomely accomplished, and its members may return to their native city with the assurance that its service are gretefully appreciated by all good and loyal citizens, whilst the Government it equally confident that when the country again calls upon them the appeal will not be made in vain to the young men of New York.

By order:

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.
