timber, and commanding the entire ground over which we were compelled to approach.

My regiments were soon in line, with Captain Griffiths' battery in position, which soon opened with its usual spirit upon the enemy. Simultaneously with this the rebel batteries also opened with accurate range, and for about half an hour we sustained alone the concentrated fire of their infantry and artillery. Finally other brigades and batteries became engaged, and the battle raged with terrific fury along our lines. My command, however, remained in front during the entire engagement, and all the time under the enemy's fire. They retired only after the battle had ceased and the enemy had again retreated from the field.

During these five hours' hard fighting I am proud to say that the officers and men of this brigade acted with the utmost coolness, and with a determined courage that would have done honor to veteran troops. They promptly obeyed every command, and displayed a degree of heroism which nothing but the influence of exalted patriotism could have produced.

To Colonel Merrill, of the Twenty-first Iowa; Lieutenant-Colonel Glasgow, of the Twenty-THIRD Iowa; Lieutenant-Colonel Moore, [Wood?] of the Eleventh Wisconsin, and Major Atherton, of the Twenty-SECOND Iowa Regiments, I am under great obligations for the coolness and promptitude with which they obeyed my orders in the various movements on the field. Their associate officers, too, are entitled to great credit, as all of them, so far as I have been able to learn, performed their duties nobly.

To the dauntless and heroic men of the ranks ant the line officers all honor is due. Never did brave men endure more with less murmuring then they during those thirty consecutive hours of hard marching and severe fighting; but when the history of this war is fully written, they will be numbered among the bravest defenders of the republic.
