ADDENDA.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. TWENTY-FOURTH ARMY CORPS,

No,41. In the Field, Va., April 4, 1865.

With great satisfaction the major-general commanding congratulates his gallant command upon the successful operations of the past few days. The Twenty-fourth Army Corps has demonstrated that with a well organized, disciplined force, no military achievement is impossible. The marching has been superior to anything of the kind heretofore witnessed, and the desperate assault upon Fort Gregg, the last of the enemy's strongholds around Petersburg, entitles the command to a place alongside their late gallant comrades of Fort Fisher. Your commander is proud of your.

By command of Major General John Gibbon:
