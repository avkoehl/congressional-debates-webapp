General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Our men returned this morning. The old man says that Ewell's corps went to Tennessee last Monday. He did not have time to go to the army himself, but yesterday he saw a man from Fredericksburg who had gone up to Culpeper on Monday as claimant to get certificates for damages done to his property and that of citizens around Fredericksburg. These certificates were to come from officers in Ewell's corps. The claimant returned to Fredericksburg on Tuesday, and said that he was unable to complete his business, because Ewell's corps had left for Tennessee on Monday. This is the authority, and the old na thinks it straight.
