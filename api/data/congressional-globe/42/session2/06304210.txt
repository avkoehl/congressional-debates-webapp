THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 4,
Bat, Mr. Speaker, it was a most painful
thing for me to hear this morning in the state-
ment of the honorable gentleman from Massa-
chusetts [Mr, Dawes] of the interposition of
the Secretary of the Treasury, who when we
had reduced the revenue to the extent of $53,-
000,000 became alarmed lest we should inter-
fere with the policy of his administration in
further reduction of the national debt. If
there be any insanity prevalent in the vicinity
of the White House (1 do not say in the White
House) it is an insane desire for a reduction
of the public debt, beyond the demands of the
sinking fund; an insane determination to keep
up the price of bonds, and consequently the bur-
den of taxation, in order to more and more re-
duce the public debt. The reduction of that
debt to the extent demanded by the sinking fund
ought to be satisfactory to everybody. I am
not content, and the country will not be con-
tent with a reduction of tariff and tax burdens
to the extent of merely $53,000,000. The
people will come agaiu with louder and louder
voice, and in the next House of Representa-
tives will demand a yet. further reduction. In
my judgment the country will never be satis-
fied until a considerably larger reduction is
secured.
Mr. DAWES. Before asking a vote on this
report, I wish to say that I have some very
interesting figures which I propose to have
published in the-Globe, and I ask gentlemen
to read them. We have during the last two
years reduced the revenue $85,000,000, mak-
ing, with the $54,000,000 reduction to result
from this bill, about one hundred and forty
million dollars. The figures which I propose
to publish show the exact expenditures of
the Government for the year 1871 as com-
pared with those of 1800. In this calculation
the expenditures of 1871 are reduced to a
peace basis and a gold basis. Every item
which is attributed to a war basis is specified,
Bo that every one can understand how the
result is arrived at. 1 am surprised to be able"
to show by these figures that upon a peace
basis the actual expenditures of 1871 exceed
those of 18li0 by oiilv $0,448,000.
Mr. II0LMAN. 1'he gentleman is certainly
mistaken. The difference must be more than
thirt.y-oight million dollars.
Mr. DAWES. That may depend upon what
gentlemen consider proper to be deducted for
the war basis, t have specified all such de-
ductions in these tables, and 1 invoke for these
figures the most careful scrutiny of criticism,
whether friendly or uiifrieudly.
Those tables also show the rate of expendi-
tures of the Government per capita at inter-
vals of ten years since 1800; and it will be
found that the rate of expenditure per capita
to-day is loss than it ^ias been in any previous
year since -1810. 1 hold myself responsible
for the official figures which [ thus submit;
and, as I have said, I invite to them the closest
scrutiny. Every dollar of deduction for the
war basis is specified, so that any one making
the examination can pass judgment upon the
propriety of the deductions. I now call the
previous question.
Mr. UliOK. Before consent is given for the
printing of those figures——
• Mr. RANDALL. Of course we cannot
answer those figures if they are merely to be
printed.
Mr. DAWES. I only ask gentlemen to read
them and determine for themselves their cor-
rectness.
Mr. BROOKS. I do not wish to object
to printing those figures, but on our side of
the House we demand permission to answer
them.
Mr. DAWES. Of course.
Mr. BECK. I shall object to the printing
or those figures (because the gentleman from
Massachusetts objected to iny printing matter
in the Globe which was not delivered) unless
he will designate a time when we can answer
them.
Mr. DAWES. I will designate any time
that may suit gentlemen.
Mr. BECK. Will the gentleman give us
before this House adjourns an hour or two in
which to answer those figures?
Mr. DAWES. Certainly ; so far as it may
be in my power.
Mr. BECK. Then I do not object.
The SPEAKER. The Chair hears no objec-
tion to printing the figures in the Globe.
Mr. DAWES. Let them go into the Globe.
I now demand the previous question.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. 1 object to this
bargaining.
Mr. DAWES. Nobody should stand np
here and object. I do not consider them
authentic unless they can bear criticism. I
call the previous question.
Mr. KERR. Mr. Speaker, I consider this
an opportune time for the chairman to state
fully the full effect and operation of this bill,
but not at all a proper time in which to make
a partisan speech.
Mr. DAWES. I do not put them in for
that purpose. I wish to put them in print, .
and now, I think, is the proper time. I
absolve gentlemen from all party obligation,
so far as they are concerned. 1 say they are
figures worth looking into. They are worth
nothing if they cannot stand the test of criti-
cism.
Mr. HOLMAN. If they are correct, they
will show an increase of over thirty-eight mil-
lion dollars.
Mr. BECK. I should like to ask the gen-
tleman whether they have not been held back
until now, when it is known there can be no
opportunity to answer them?
Mr. DAWES. I have been getting them
ready, and sought an opportunity to put them
into the Globe without a word being said.

Tho expenditures per rapita are shown to be for I860, tho population being 31,443,321, $1 95; and for
1871, the population being 38,555,983, $1 76.
included in the expenditures as hero given for 1871 is tho sum of $10,733,759 05, or twenty-eight
hundredths per '-/'pita for the crcotion of public buildings, tho improvement of rivers and harbors, and
other public works distributed throughout the country; while for the same purposes in 1860 the oxpondi-
tures_ wore only $2,913,371 48, or nine hundredths per capita. Taking these expenditures on account of
publ_ic_ buildings and works into consideration, the expenses of the fiscal year 1871 of President Grant's
administration, notwithstanding the increased area of tho country, the interest on Pacific railroad bonds,
the organization of new Territories, &c., aro shown by tho following table to be as low and economical
as those of any Administration which has governed the country:
