HEADQUARTERS TENTH CORPS,May 10, 1864.

General TURNER:

GENERAL: Major-General Gillmore desires you to send one regiment toward Brandon Bridge to take a position that will enable them to support (if necessary) the Third New Hampshire. Brandon Bridge is on Weitzel's extreme right and I think near 2 miles from his right flank. I think you can move the regiment to the right of your present position and Ames' and strike the road to Brandon Bridge without coming this way.

FOSTER.

MAY 10, 1864.

Colonel JACKSON:

I shall want some infantry ammunition to-day. How many wagons can you let me have?

Respectfully,

JNO. W. TURNER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Second Division.

[Indorsement.]

Your own division supply train is expected to bring up ammunition and rations; there is no corps train. We can't find an ordnance officer, but the general has written to Colonel Shaffer. I think you ought to send your wagons back for ammunition.

Respectfully,

R. H. JACKSON,

Assistant Inspector-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,May 10, 1864-8 a. m.

Brigadier-General TURNER:

Mordecai has ammunition here. If you have rations for to-day and to-morrow it will probably be enough; if not, send back for more.

By command of Major General Q. A. Gillmore:

ED. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,May 10, 1864-12.55 p. m.

General TURNER:

I am ordered to make dispositions to retire slowly within old entrenchments. I desire you to see that no wounded or stragglers are left behind from your command, and that dispositions to carry out this order are put in effect at once. I will be on the pike for an hour or so.

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.
