Major DAVIS,

Independence, Mo;

Colonel Philips, commanding, has started scout from Warrensburg to Sni Hills to scout La Fayette County five days, and directs that our troops co- operate. You will therefore send a scout from your command immediately in that direction to co- operate as far as possible with it. The scut from Warrensburg will appear in Sni Hills this morning. Can you send Wyckoff, and where is your tri- monthly!

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., February 11, 1865- 1. 20 p. m.

Major BARNES,

Assistant Adjutant- General;

I respectfully recommend that the telegraph line from this place to Sedalia be repaired and constructed, with an office at Warsaw; also a line from this place to Mount Vernon or Neosho, as the commanding general may deem most expedient. Mount Vernon will be a great advantage, and it will be difficult to keep it up west of that place.

I have received information fro a female spy that I had employed that the rebels are concentrating their forces, 500 strong, on the Dry Fork of Osage, in Arkansas. Please give me a sufficient number of men to dislodge them, or instructions what course I shall pursue. If I receive no instructions I shall leave in the morning.
