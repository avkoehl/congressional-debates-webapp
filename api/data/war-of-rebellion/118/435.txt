Lieutenant Colonel J. L. DONALDSON,

Quartermaster, U. S. Army, Baltimore, Md.

COLONEL: Your telegram of this date is just received and I have replied by telegram giving you all the information I have in relation to the movement of prisoners. When I sent instructions to the West for this movement I requested that you might have timely so that there might be no delay for transportation, and Colonel Swords was directed by General Wright, in Department of the Ohio, to make the necessary arrangements. There must be some 8,000 to 10,000 prisoners to be forwarded in all and most or all of them are now on their way to Baltimore. About 5,000 are to come from Saint Louis and Alton (I gave you notice of 1,100 of these), 3,000 from Chicago and perhaps 2,000 from Camps Butler, Chase and Morton and the depot at Sandusky. These numbers will enable you to make an estimate of how much transportation you will require.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,
