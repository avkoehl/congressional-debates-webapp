PINE BLUFF, April 30, 1864-7 a.m.

Brigadier-General WEST:

I sent a scout to General Steele two hours ago to inform him of our situation. The officer who came in from him last night says General Steele does not need re-enforcements and that he wished the commanding officer at Pine Bluff to send to him for re-enforcements if this place was in danger. It has rained heavily all night, and I feel, under all the circumstances, very doubtful about the propriety of going out, the roads being so bad that we cannot get the train to General Steele so soon as he can get here or to Little Rock. Colonel Clayton with a large part of his force is now at Saline, on his way back.

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General.

LITTLE ROCK, April 30, 1864-4.30 p.m.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS:

Your dispatch of 7 a.m. is just received. Remain where you are, subject to General Steele's orders. Send Graves' regiment up by the Leonora. Keep me posted.

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, April 30, 1864.

Brigadier-General ANDREWS,

Pine Bluff, Ark.:

My pickets are being driven in; the enemy's strength not known yet. I am told the Leonora will carry a battery as well as Graves' regiment. Send the Fifth Ohio Battery on her, or as much of it as she will carry. Inform General Steele of the state of affairs here for his guidance. Answer.

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, April 30, 1864.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS,

Pine Bluff, Ark.:

Two stupid scouts have created a false alarm. General Steele's advance is within 3 miles of here. Send up the battery and Graves.

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., April 30, 1864.

Colonel OLIVER WOOD,

Commanding, Brownsville:

The general commanding directs me to say to you that by a telegram sent to you last night you were empowered to make such disposition of your force as you deemed proper. If the arrangement is satisfactory to you, it will be satisfactory to the commanding general.

SAM. T. BRUSH,

First Lieutenant, Eighteenth Illinois Infantry, A. A. A. G.
