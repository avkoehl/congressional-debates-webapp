HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,August 25,, 1864-3.40 p. m.

General MEADE:

The enemy just assaulted Miles' front in two lines, but were repulsed, and prisoners say were badly broken up. They give some indication of an attack now on my left. The enemy's advance was made without firing a shot and some of the prisoners were taken within fifteen paces of the breast-works. Anderson's brigade, of Field's division, is here- prisoners say the only one. A second prisoners says he saw Hill on the field. This prisoners says he is a Union man.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

An examination on the country leads me to believe that the enemy cannot turn my right without making a wide detour by the Vaughan road, and they have not time to do this to-night. The right of my line extends nearly to Jones' Hole Swamp, impassable for troops in line. I am more apprehensive concerning my left, but it is getting so late the enemy must make vigorous use of the time to gain any advantage. I have ordered up Willcox's division as a precaution. Have heard nothing from the cavalry reported to have passed in the direction of the plank road. There is only skirmishing going on now.

They are heard chopping, I suppose felling abatis, thought the pickets report they hear artillery moving where the chopping is going on. I still hold the road between me and Warren. The enemy have meade no demonstration on the Vaughan road.
