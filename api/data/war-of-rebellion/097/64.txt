The enemy opened up yesterday afternoon with the columbiad upon the Avery house, and kept up a persistent fire until dark. Our batteries did not reply for some time, but as soon as they opened the enemy returned vigorously with mortars. Seven deserters have been reported. They represent three brigades of Grimes' (Battle's old) division. These are very intelligent men.
