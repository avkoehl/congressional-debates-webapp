Public Expenditures—Air. Hubbard.
Senate.
first and  lust of those years, had nearly equalled
one hundred and  fifty thousand  doüars.      The
public printing; also, payments from the Treasury
to compensate custom-ho^e officers,  in   conse-
quence of the gradual redoc ion of duties under
the tariff of 1833, and on account of the necessary
redaction of their fees, have, in a single year,
nearly equalled two hundred   thousand   dollars.
These increased expenses and charges upon the
Treasury vere the effect of the legislation of Con-
gress, and could not with any more propriety be
charged to this than to any former Administration.
They were provided for and required by existing
lawsj and the Executive  charged with the execu-
tion of those lawi can in no respect be made cul-
pable for expenditures warranted by such enact-
ments.   He.would not proced further in under-
taking to show what goes to make up the differ-
ence between  the expendí ures of 1824 and of
1839.   If the items to which he has referred were
added, it would be found that the aggregate would
make all the difference in the expenditures of those
years.   The resolution, and he presumed the re-
port   also,   did  the same justice to   the  Admi-
nistration    which    precede!    that   of    General
Jackson   as   it   did   to   his,   and   as   it  does
to. the   Administration   of   the  present   incum-
bent.   The same information was n'qairel for the
year 1824 as was required for the year 1829—and
the same information was asked for the last year
of Mr. Adams's as ior the last year of Mr.Van Bu-
ren's administration.    No mjus'ice, then, his be^n
done—no partiality has been shown to either Ad-
ministration; and he confidently believed that it was
not in the power of any Senator to put his finger
on a single entry in that report which did not ac-
cord with the truth.    In order, then, more satisfrc
tonly to show ihat this Administration was entire-
ly exempt from the charge of wasteful extravagance
in the public expenditures—he purposed to make a
more minute comparison of the exp^nlitures of the
Government, for the years 1824 and 1833.   This
comparison would be more just, as the long session
of Congress took place in each of those years. His
object was to confine himself exclusively to the
permanent and ordinary expenditures of the Go-
vernment in those years.   Tne Senator from Mis-
souri had faithfully stated the extraordinary expen-
ditures and the reasons and necessicy therefor: he
did not intend to refer at all to them.
In 1324, it will be seen, that the aggregate ex-
penditures for ordinary and permanent purposes
amounted to the sum of $7,107,892 05.
In 1838 they amounted to $13,837,594 44.
Making a difference against the year 1838, of
(16,729,702 39.
He would now endeavor to show some of the
items of expenditure which went to makeup that
difference:

tures under tame heads in 1824.

examined; if so, there was no friend of truth
and justice that would dare to charge upon this
Administration extravagance and profl gacy, for
such i'ems of expenditure so essentially, so closely
connected with the public welfare.
The foregoing table had been prepared from a
careful comparison of the public expenditures in
the years 1824 aid 1838, and he had no doubt ihat
it would be found to be substantially correct. It
will be se n among the i ems that the expenses of
the Executive Dep ¡rtments had been increased in
1839 over the expenses of 1824, $383,000. Let
not the Adrnini-j'ration for this be charged with
ex ravagance. The cause of th's increase would
mainly be found to proceed from the organiEation
of the Land Office—from the necessary increase
of expenditure in the Post Office Department, in-
cluding Ihe establishment, by law, of an Auditor's
0*fice—from the necessary increase of the Indian
Department, including the establishment of a Com-
missioner of Indian Affairs—from the Pension De-
partment, including the establishment of a Com-
missioner of Pensions, and from the creation of a
Solicitor's Department. It will be recollected that
in 1832, and in 1836, important changes were made
in the pension laws, unavoidably increasing the
expenses of that branch of the War Depaitment.
Tnis expenditure of $383,000, in 1838, is thus
shown to have been necessarily incurred by the
effect of existing laws, and for the proper admi-
nisiration of our public affairs. This addition to
the public expenditure, since 1824, in the Execu-
tive Department, had partly arisen from our In-
dian re'ations having assumed a new posture since
that period. They had arisen partly from the
great increase of our population, and from the
consequent increase of the public business. He
had prepared another table, showirg a comparison
between the expend tures of the Government in
1824, and in 1838, arranged under appropriate
heads, and accom[ anied with brief remarks, giv-
ing seme of the reasons for the necessary increase
of the public expenditures in 1838. He would
here subjoin that table:
The following table is an exhibit of the perma-
nent expenses of the Government on some leading
items, in the years 1824 and 1839, with a brief
statement of some of the reasons for the difference:

He had been able, by referring to the document 
which the Secretary of the Treasury had commu-
nicated to the House of Representatives, one num-
bered 39, and was printed January 4, 1836, the
other numbered 17, and was printed December 30,
1839, to- present the foregoing table; and thus
showed conclusively that the few items above spe-
c fied, make a difference in the amount, of the ne-
cessary «rid indispensable expenditures of the Go-
vernment, in 1824 and in 1838, for permanent pur-
poses, of over s'x millions of dollars; aHd account-
ing for the whole difference, with the exception of
less than a million of dollars, which the table, be-
fore exhibi'ed, accounts for. And yet it has been
sounded from Maine to Florida, that the expendi-
tures of this Administraron had trebled the expen-
ditures of that of the younger Adam*; that while
the disbursements of the latter were annually thir-
teen-mil lions, the expenses of this Administration
amounted to forty millions annually. Such were
at this moment the character of the charges against
this Administration pervading the country.
He asked for justice, and for nothing but justice.
He desired to have the document upon the table
printed. He wished for its extensive circulation,
not to deceive, but to undeceive, the American
people—to enable them to understand this whole
matter. He was not aware, in the list of items
which he had specified, that there was a single one
calculated to swell the aggregate of public expendi-
tures, for which those in the Oppositit n had not
voted. He made no complaint for their so doing.
They were expenditures which the posture of pub-
lic affairs and the condition of the country re-
quired.
It has been said, by Senators in the Opposition,
that this Adminis'ration are answerable for the ag-
gregate of public expenditures; that the people
should look only to the footings of the account;
that temporary expenditures take place, of neces-
sity, under every Administration. Will this course
serve gentlemen? How compares the aggregate of
the expenditures of this, with that of former Admi-
nistrations? This, it is said, is the true criterion to
test the economy, or to show the extravagance, of
an Administration. How stands the account be-
tween 1824 and 1839, in the aggregate expendi-
tures? Not more favorabte to the Opposition.
But is this the fair, the honest, the just mode of
settling the account? May there not be public ex-
penditures of a temporary character unavoidable
in one year, which would not occur in another?
Would it be right to charge such an expenditure
to the Administration then in power? No, sir; no.
The true mode is the one which he had adopted for
his guide. Look to the permanent expenditures of
the Government for each year; compare the ex-
penditures of one, with those of another year; let
the difference be made to appear; and let the Ad-
ministration in power account for any 'difference
against it. This would be right; but if it suits Se-
nators in the Opposition better to take the annual
aggregate of expenditures for all purposes, and to
compare th<* aggregate of one Administration with
that of another, it will lead to no more favorable
result for them for the years 1924 and 1838,, or;
1839, than that before stated. The Senators over
the way would Eain nothing by instituting anysoch
comparison. But the report of the Secretary, now
before the Sena'e, had been denounced te?aus?,."
