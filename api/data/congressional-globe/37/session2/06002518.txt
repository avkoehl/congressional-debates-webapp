Mr. HOWE. There is a mistake in the print-
ing of that amendment. The first clause of it
should read, " bank check, draft, or order for the
payment of any sum of money drawn upon any
bank, trust company, or any person or persons,
companies or corporations, atsight or on demand,
two cents;" and then the words " bills of ex-
change, (inland,) "should commenced new clause.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The amendment
"wilt be so changed, if there be no objection,
Mr.SUMNER, i und erstand the Senator that
the proposition as it leally was is not in its details
applicable to bank checks. It ought not to be;
but as it is here, it is applicable to bank checks.,
Mr. F&SbENDEN. Is the charge to be two
cents for any bank check r
Mr. HOWE. Not over two cents for nnv.
The "VICE PRESIDENT. The amendment,
as modified, is concurred in.
Mr. SUMNER. [ hope the Senator will put
it in precise form. It is a very important clause,
and it is very important that it should be reduced
to precise form.
Mr. HOWE. I presume the Clerk has it right.
Mr. SUMNER. That whole clause, as it is
now, is cut into two.
Mr. HOWE. Yes, sir.
Mr."SUMNER. Now I understand it.
The Secretary continued the reading of the
amendments, as follows:
On page 141, strike out from line thirty-seven to line
forty-seven of schedule B, in these words, "bill of lading
or receipt for any goods, merchandise, qr effects, to be car-

Strike outline one hundred and foity-eight, on page 143,
in the words, " manifest of part of the cargo of any vessel,
(or custom-house clearance,) 25 cents "
Aftet the wotd " -steameiin line one hundied and fifty,
on page 143, insert. " for a foreign poit ;*> so as to make the
clause read, " manifest for custom-house entry or clear-
ance, on the caigo of any ship, vessel, or Mcainei, for a
foreign poit, if the leci&tered tonnage of such «lup,vessel,
or steamei does not exceed tlnee hundred tons, $1: exceed-

additional $10,000. or fractional part theieof, in c.\cesd of
$50,000, $10 "
On page 144, line one hundied and sixty-eight, stukc out
" if less than $30."
Mr. FES8ENDEN. That is a mistake. The
whole clause should be left as it was, to read " pas-
sage ticket by any vessel from a port in the United
States to a foreign port, if less than $30, fifty cents;
exceeding; §30, $1."
The VICE PRESIDENT. The amendment
wi 11 be regarded as non-concurred in,and the clause
will remain in that form.
Mr. KING. Is that tax to apply to passen-
gers dossing between the United States and Can-
ada on ferry boats?
Mr. FESSENDEN. The last clause of the
schedule reads:
jind provided further, That the stamp duties imposed by
the foregoing schedule B, on manifests, bills of lading, and
passage tickets, shall not apply to steamboats or other ves-
sels plying between ports otthe United States and ports in
British North America.
Mr. KING. Very well.
The Secretary continued the reading of the
amendments:
On page 144, after the word "society," in line one hun-
dred and seventy-thiee, insert " except religious, charita-
ble, or literary societies, or public cemeteries;" so that the
clause will read: u power of attorney or pioxy for voting
at any election for otficeis of any incorporated company,
or society, except leligious, charitable, or literary societies,
or public cemetciics, ten cents."
On page 144, line one hundred and ninety-one, in the
clause iclativo to the " probate of wills or letters of admin-
i-tiation." strike out "exceeding $100,000, $20," and in-
sert " exceeding $100,000, and not exceeding $150,000, $20;
and for every additional $50,000, or fractional part thereof,
On page 144, strike out lines one hundred and ninety-
nine and two liuudied, in the words, " appeal from the de-
cree or judgment or final order of any court to a higher or
appellate couit, 50 cents."
Alter the word " equity," in line two hundred and two,
on page 145, insert " 50 cents," as the tax on writs orother
original process.
O.i page 146, schedule C, lines two hundred and sixty-
six, two'hundred and sixty-seven, and two hundred and
sixty-eight, strike out the words " Playing eaids.—For and

On page 152, at the end of section one hundred and eight,
insert: " Jlnd provided fiat her y That no administrator,
executor, oi trustee, who, by his default or laches, shall
cause the tiust propeity under bis chaige to pay increased
taxes, with expenses and costs under this section, shall bo
allowed to charge or to receive credit for the same in set-
tling his accounts with those beneficiaries interested in the
trust property aforesaid."
Mr. FESSENDEN. That was put in as a
penalty for exccutors and other trustees not pay-
ing the fees, &c.; but on reflection I do not know
that we can provide any such thing. It seems to
be a matter for the States. We have nothing to
do with the settling" of these accounts, and the
States will do as they please in regard to them.
I move that the amendment be disagreed to.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will put
the question on non-concurring in this amend-
ment.
The amendment was non-concuned in.
The Secretary concluded the reading of the
amendments, as follows:
At the end of section one hundred and eleven, insert as
a proviso:
Provided, That any ceitificate of drawhack forgoods ex-
poitrd, issued in pursuance of the provisions of this act,
ma}, under such regulations as may be prescubcd by the
riccietaiy of the Treasury, be jecoived by the collector or
his deputy in payment of duties under this act; and the Sec-
ictarv ofthe Treasury may make such regulations witlue-
gaid to the form of said certificates and the issuing thereof
as in hi** judgment may be necessary.
In-eit at the end of the bill as a new section :

purposes." approved August 5.1861. as imposes a diteet tax

authorize the levy and collection of one tax to that amount.
The VICE PRESIDENT- All the amend-
ments made as in Committee of the Whole have
been read. Those upon which separate votes have
not been requested are regarded as concurred in.
The Secretary xvill now read the excepted amend-

The Secretary read the first excepted amend-
