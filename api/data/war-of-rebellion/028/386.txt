General GEORGE STONEMAN,Poolesville:

As soon as a pontoon bridge can be thrown across the Potomac near you (probably in two or three days), the commanding general directs that you concentrate your artillery and infantry near Leesburg, keeping out a line of cavalry pickets upon the Little River pike from the point where it crosses Goose Creek to Snickersville.

General Sumner's cavalry will connect with yours at Snickersville, and General Banks' cavalry will connect with your left at the crossing of Goose Creek.

Please report the amount of cavalry you now have under your command, and what additional force of this arm, if any, you will require to perform the service specified.

Chief of Staff.
