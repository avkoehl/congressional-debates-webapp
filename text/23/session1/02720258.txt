of the act cf 1783, the gold coins of all nations
which equahed those of England, Fiance, Spam,

cents the pennyweight, and the siher coins of all
nations which equalled the Spanish dollar in fine-

Sir, (said Mi  B ,) I am unwilling to appear al
ways in the same tiain, 'racing up all the evils of
our currency to ihe same fountain cf mischief— I
the mtioduction of the paper svstem, and the first
establishment of a Federal bank among us—but .
justice must have its sv/ay, histoncal truth must |
take us course, facts must be told, and authentic
proof shall supply the place of nairative and as
sertion    (We ascend, then, to the year '91—to the
exhibition ot the plan fir the support of public '
<re lu—and *ee in that pi in, is one of its features,
a pioposition for the establishment of a national
Mint, and in that establishment a subsidiary en-
gine for the support of the Fedeial bank     We
have alieady seen, tl at in the pioposition for the
establishment of the Mint, gold wac largely under
valued, and that this undei valuation has driven
gold'torn the country, and left a vacuum foi the
circulation of Fedeial banknotes   Weaie nowto
see that the same Mint establishment wa*> to give
iurthei  aid to the cuculation of these notes by
excluding foieign coins, both gold and ^ilve-, fiom
uiculation, and thus enlaiging the vacuum which
was to be iilled by bank paper     This is what we
aie now to see, and to see it we will look at the
plan for the support of pub! c credit, and thatfea-
ture of the plan which pioposes the establishment '"

Mi D would lemark that four points were pie- '
sented in this extract 1st, The eventual abolition |
of the currency of foreign coins, 2-i,The i eduction
of their value vhi'e allowed to cnculate, 3d, |
The oubsti u ion of domest c coirs, and 4 h, The |
substitution of bank i otes, in plpce of the uncui- j
rent and undeivalued foieign coins Such weve
the lecommeidations of Secretary Hamilton, and
legislative enactments quickly followed to convert I
h •> recoirme datiors into law The only power .
tne Const tution had given to Congress over for- i
eign coins was, i powei to legu'ate their value
and to pio ec^ them from debasement by countei-
feiters It was cettam'y a most strange constiuc-
tion of that authority fust to unJeaate the value of
these coins, and next to prohibit their cuculation '
Yet both things were Jor e Ihe Mint went into
operation in 1794 fo-eifn coins were to cease to '
be a legal tender in 1797, but, at the end of that
time, the contingencies on which the Secietarv
calculated to enable the countiy to do without
foreign coins had not occarred, the substitutes
had not appeared, the Mint had not supplied the
adequate quantity of domestic coin, roi had the
cuculation of banknotes become sufficiently famJiar
to the people to supeisede gold The law for the
exclusion of foieign coins was found to be imprac-
ticable, and a suspension of it for three years was i
enacted At the end of this time the evil was
found to be as great as evei, and a furthei suspen-
sion of three years was made This thud teim
of thiee years also rolled ovei, the supply of do-
mestic coins was still found to be inadequate, and
the people continued to be as averse as ever to the
bank note substitute A fourth suspension of the |
law became necessary, and in 1806 a further sus-
pension for three years was made, aftei that a
fifth, and finally a sixth, suspension, each for the
penod of thiee years, which biought the period
for the actual and final cessation of the circulation
of fore gn coins to the month of November, 1819
From that time there was no further suspension
of the prohibitory act An exception was con-
tinued,and still remains, in favoi of Spanish milled
dollars, and parts of doilace, but all other foreign
coins, even those of Mexico, and all the South
American States, have ceased to be a legal tendei,
and have lost their character of cunent money
within the United States Their value is degraded
to the Mint puce of bullion, and thus the consti-
tutional currency becomes an article of merchan-
d ze and exportation Even the Spanish milled
dollar, though continued as a legal tendei, is valued
not as money, but foi the pure silver in it, and is,
therefore, undervalued thiee or four per cent ,and
becomes an article of meichandize The Bank of
the United States has collected and sold <j4,450,-
000 of them Lvery money dealer is employed
in buying, selling, and exporting; them Tlie
South and We¡>t, which receives them, is stupped
of them 1 he letter i ead m the Senate two days
ago fiom the brokers in Georgia, to exculpate
themselves from eironeous representations on this
floor, contained a striking pioof of this fact It
s'ated that,m the sum of 034,000 of silvei drawn
by them out of the United States Branch Bank
in Savannah, there were 27,700 Spanish dollars,
that these Spanish dollars were not paid over to i
the State banks m Georgia, which had contracted
for the silver, but remitted to New York, where I
trey commanded a premium of thiee or four per
cent Mi B did not mention this ciicumstance
as a thing ol ]ectiomble in those who did it, if
they had not drawn them from the branch bank,
that branch would have remitted them to the
mothei bank, and she would have sold them, and
the fact of be ng paid any part of their demand in
Spanish dollars, was pi oof 'hat their soecie wis
out' His object was to fix public attention upon
tne fact of the undervaluation of silver, as well as
of gold, and the consequent abstiaction of that coin
fiom the South and Wes , and the exportation of
it from the country
Having gone through this narrative of facts, and
shown the exclusion of foreign coins from circula-
tion to be a part of the paper system, and intended
to faCjuUgte the substitution of a bmk note cur-
rency. Jar. B went on to state the irjunes result-
ing from the measuie At the head of these in-
juries he was bound to place the violation of the
Constitution of the United States, which clearly
intended that foreign coins should circulate among
us, and which, n giving Congress authority to
legulate then value, and to protect them from
counteijeiteis, could never have intended to stop
their circulation, and to abandon them to debase-
ment 2 He denounced this exclusion of foreign
coins as a fraud, and a fraud of the most injurious
natuie, upon the people of the States The States
had surrendered their powei over the coinage to
Congiess they made the surrender in language
which clearly implied that their currency offore'gn
coins was to be continued to them, yet that cur-
rency is sjppressed, a currency of intrinsic value,
for which they paid interest to nobody, is sup-
pressed, and a currency without intrinsic value,
a currency of paper, subject to every fluctuation,
and for the supply of which corporate bodies
receive intei est, is substituted in its place 3 He
objected to this suppression, as depriving** the
whole Union, and especially the "Western States,
of their due and necessary supply of hard money.
Since that law took effect, the United States had
only been a thoroughfare for foreign coins to pass
through All that was brought into the country
had to go out of the country It was exported as
fast as imported The custom-house books proved
this fact. They proved that from 1821 to 1833,
the imports of specie were §89,428,462, the ex-
ports, for the same time, were $88,821,433, lack-
ing but three quarters of a million of being pre-
cisely equal to the imports ' Some of this coin
was recomed befoie it was exported, a foolish and
expensive operation on the part of the United
States, but the greater pait was exported in the
same form that it was íeceived Mr B had only
been able to get the exports and imports from
1821, lfhe could have obtained those ofl820,and
the concluding part of 1819, when the prohibitory
law took effect, the amount would have been about
ninety six millions of dollars, the whole of wfuch
was lost to the country by the prohibitory law,
while much of it would have been saved, and
re'amed for home circulation, if it had not been for
this law The loss of this great sum in specie
was an injury to the whole Union, but especially
to the Western States, whose sole resource for com
was from foreign countries, for the coinage of the
Mint could never flow into that region, there was
nothing in the course of trade, and exchanges, to
carry money fiom the Atlantic States to the West;
and the Mint, if it comed thousands of millions,
could not supply them. The taking effect of the
law in the year 1819, wa3 an aggravation of the
injury It was the most unfortunate and ruinous
of all t'tnes for driving specie from the countiy.
The western banks, from their exertions to aid the
countiy during the war, had stretched their issues
to the utmost limit, their notes had gone into the
¡and offices, the Federal Government turned them
over to the Bank of the United States, and that
bank demanded specie Thus, their necessity for
specie was increased at the Very moment that the
supply was diminished, and the general stopoage
of the western banks was the inevitable and nat-
ural result of these combined circumstances
Mr B then read an extract from the memorial
of the General Assembly of Louisiana, dated
March, 1S20, r ndnstrating against the perni-
cious consequences of the law for the exclusion
of foreign coins( and piaying that it might ba
REPEALED.
