Major General G. M. DODGE,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

GENERAL: After due deliberation and careful investigation of the condition of things in Cavalry and Boone Counties, I propose to try the experiment of turning over those counties to the civil authorities. The people promise fair, and I have in each county a reliable man for sheriff. If you will withdraw the provost-marshals from each of those counties, and all troops except the companies organized under Order Numbers 3, and the militia companies, I will try and impress the people with the responsibility devolved upon them to keep out bushwhackers, and I think they will did it. If they fail me in this I want to take some loyal militia among them for a few days, after which those counties will be to let to new-comers.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOS. C. FLETCHER.
