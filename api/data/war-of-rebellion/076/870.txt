very likely they are reconnoitering for the purpose of attempting a crossing at some point. I have sent another scout across the river on foot, with instructions to go in the rear of the enemy, and advise me of their movements.

Very respectfully,

J. F. GAINES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

P. S.-I am picketing and scouting about five miles above McAfee's Bridge, and have about 200 men on the line below the bridge.

J. F. G.

I inclose you dispatch* just received from Captain Mastin; have ordered the ford picketed which he describes.

Yours,

J. F. GAINES,

Lieutenant-Colonel.

BURNT BRIDGE, July 8, 1864.

Captain TERRETT,

Kelly's Headquarters:

CAPTAIN: In accordance with report sent in by Lieutenant Cotton, commanding picket, first post above burnt bridge, the enemy is moving with considerable force up the river in the direction of McAfee's Bridge; they have with them four or six pieces of artillery. He reports they have a good many wagons, supposed to be pontoon bridges. They have been quite busy during this afternoon, just opposite us on the river, at work on timber. Their move commenced about dark.

Very respectfully,

J. F. GAINES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

NEAR CAVALRY FORD, July 8, 1864-9 o'clock.

Colonel B. J. HILL:

COLONEL: The advance of the enemy is about a mile and a quarter from the river, on this side. There is no doubt they are crossing infantry and artillery. They can be plainly heard laying a pontoon bridge at Cavalry Ford. One of my men who was at the point late this evening says he saw about two brigades of infantry this side of the river, with fixed bayonets, marching by fours. They can be heard crossing to-night. There is no doubt but there is a considerable force crossing at that point. Cannot tell their number.

Very respectfully,

C. Y. WILSON.

P. S. There is no mistake about the pontoon, for I was close to the river and could hear them at work on it. A good many of their force waded the river.

C. Y. W.
