Colonel JOSEPH WHEELER, Chief of Cavalry:

COLONEL: Your communication of this date, written at 7 a.m., was received this evening. We have reached this place all safe, but the roads are rough. The general commanding will make London to-morrow. He instructs me to say that Colonel Scott has been ordered to report to you. I inclose you a map of the route this evening received.

I have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS KIRBY SMITH'S BRIGADE,Near Crab Orchard, Ky., October 14, 1862.

Colonel WHEELER:

My command is 2 miles from Crab Orchard, on the road leading to Stanford. My brigade is about 1,000 strong. My horses are very much jaded, having been in front of Major General E. Kirby Smith's army since his entrance into Kentucky. I consulted General Bragg this morning, and he consented that I should take my command via Somerset, in order that might procure forage on the route, unless my services are absolutely required to assist you in getting out, in which case I am at your service. I shall, however, remain in my present position until I hear from you.

Very respectfully,

J. S. SCOTT,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

General BRAGG, Crab Orchard, Ky.:

SIR: Your first note from Crab Orchard was received. My command, from loss of sleep for five nights, is completely exhausted. The straggling has been unusually great. The rear of the column will not reach here before daybreak. I have no hope of saving the whole of my train, as I shall be obliged to double teams in going up Big Hill, and will be necessarily delayed there two or three days. There is quite a strong position in front of Big Hill, which I will hold as long as possible.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E, KIRBY SMITH,

Major-General.
