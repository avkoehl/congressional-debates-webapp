CAIRO, March 16, 1863.

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS:

Recent instructions have been given to Captain Fitch by Admiral Porteer, through me. He is now up Tennessee River, to carry them out. There can be no difficulty about the convoy of transports, provided they all assemble at the time appointed by Captain Fitch, and those at Nashville unloaded and ready to return with him on his arrival there. Captain Fitch reports to me that effort is being made to purchase arms and equip more boats, to re-enforce those now on the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers.

A. M. PENNOCK,

Fleet Commander and Captain.

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Murfreesborough, Tenn.:

Your telegram of yesterday just received. I write you more fully than I could communicate by the wires.

A. LINCOLN.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Murfreesborough, Tenn., March 17 [?], 1863.

Major General HORATIO G. WRIGHT, Cincinnati:

Your dispatch received. I answer your last question first. I think your are indignant. I was under the impression that you had 12,000 under Gillmore. As to the occupation of Mill Springs, the safety of any force on the other side of the Cumberland depends on the power of this army for offensive action. I had hopes of something from those 20,000 Kentuckians. My apprehensions from raids into Northeastern Kentucky are not great if they are confined to that region. I think this "pawn" ought not to move back. Keep me posted, and we will work together.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

LEROY FITCH,

Lieutenant Commanding.
