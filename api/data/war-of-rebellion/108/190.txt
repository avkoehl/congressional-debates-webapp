WYTHEVILLE, July 22, 1861.

Honorable L. P. WALKER:

The enemy has crossed the Ohio and are advancing up the valley of Guyandotte, stated upon what seems to be reliable authority. Much uneasiness is felt even in Tazewell County. The people are ready to turn out en masse, but are without powder. Send me here by express if possible one dozen kegs of powder to be sent to Logan and Wyoming. The last of my men can leave this week for Jackson's River.

JOHN B. FLOYD,

Brigadier-General.

[Indorsement.]

General LEE:

I have directed Major Gorgas to forward twenty-five kegs of powder in the morning. I send you this that you may be advised of the rumor.

L. P. W[ALKER].
