It was soon found that the enemy had crossed to the north side of Appomattox; but so close was the pursuit that the Second Corps got possession of the common bridge at high Bridge before the enemy could destroy it, and immediately crossed over. The Sixth Corps and a division of cavalry at Farmville to its support.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

General Meade followed north of the Appomattox, and General Sheridan, with all the cavalry, pushed straight for Appomattox Station, followed by General Ord's command and the Fifth Corps, During the day General Meade's advance had considerable fighting with the enemy's rear guard, but was unable to bring on a general engagement.
