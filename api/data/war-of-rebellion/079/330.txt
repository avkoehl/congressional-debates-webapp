ROME, October 17, 1864 - 5 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Your dispatch received. Will try and open communication with Garrard at Dirt Town.

We get very little information, owing to the large number of cavalry surrounding us. Wagon trains and supplies are reported occasionally in and about Jacksonville. Have nothing of importance.
