Washington, April 7, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have the honor to inclose herewith a copy of a dispatch addressed to me to-day by Commander F. A. Parker, commanding the Potomac Flotilla, and would suggest whether in view of the information communicated by him and the recent capture of vessels in the waters of the Chesapeake Bay by piratical parties, it would not be advisable to have the Peninsula or the Northern Neck, to which he refers, for an increase of the gun boat fleet in the waters of the Chesapeake and Potomac so as to prevent, as far as in the power of the naval force, the success of the rebels in their designs.

Very respectfully,

GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of Navy.

[Inclosure.]

U. S. S. DON, POTOMAC FLOTILLA,

April 7, 1865.

Honorable G. WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: I am informed by the engineer of the Harriet De Ford, recently captured by the rebels, that while a prisoner on the North Neck of Virginia he learned that parties were organizing for the purpose of capturing vessels on the bay, and that an attempt would be made to seize the Highland Light, a steamer by refugees, who assert that the object of the rebels is to burn and pillage generally. I am led to believe that an attempt will be made to burn the bridge over Gunpowder and Bush Rivers and to destroy the boat belonging to the railroad company at Have de Grace.

Very respectfully,

FOXHALL A. PARKER,

Commander, U. S. Navy, Commanding Potomac Flotilla.
