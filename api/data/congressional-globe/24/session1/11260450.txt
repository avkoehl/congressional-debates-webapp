exterminate'   \   hat, in a prudential and military
point of view, would be the addition of Texas to
your domain'    It would be weakness, and not
power   Is your southern and southwestern fron-
tier not sufficiently extensive, not  sufficiently
feeble, not sufficiently defenseless' Why aie you
adding regiment after regiment of dragoons to
your standing army >   Why are you sti uggling,
by direction and by indirection, to raise pe> *altum
that army fiom less than six to more than twenty
thousand men'   Your commanding general, now
returning from his excursion to Florida, openly
recommends the increase of your Army to that
number.   Sir, the extension of your sea-coast
fiontier from the Sabine to the Rio Bravo would
add to your weakness tenfold, for it is now only
weakness with reference to Mexico.    It would
then be weakness with reference to Great Britain,
to France, even peihaps to Russia, to every naval
European Power, which might make a quairel
with us for the sake of settling a colony, but,
above all, to Great Britain.    She, by her naval
power, and by her American colonies, holds the
keys of the Gulf of Mexico. What would be the
condition of your frontier from the mouth of the
Mississippi to that of the Rio del Norte, in the
event of a war with Great Britain '    Sir, the
reasons of Mr. Monroe for accepting the Sabine
as the boundary weie three.   First, he had no
confidence in the strength of our claim as far as
the Rio Bravo; secondly, he thought it would
make our Union so heavy that it would break
into fragments by its own weight,   thudly, he
thought it would protrude a long line of sea-coast,
which, in our first war with Great Britain, she
might take into her own possession, and which we
should be able neither to defend nor to recover.
At that time there was no question of slaveiy or
abolition involved in the controversy    The coun-
try belonged to Spain, it was a wilderness, and
slavery was the   established   law of the land
There was then no project for carving out nine
slave States, to hold eighteen seats in the other
wing of this Capitol, in the triangle between the
mouths and the sources of the Mississippi and
Bravo rivers.    But what was our claim f   Why,
it was that La Salle, having discovered the mouth
of the Mississippi, and France having made a
settlement at New Orleans, France had a right to
one half the sea-coast from the mouth of the Mis-
sissippi to the next Spanish settlement, which
was Vera Cruz.   The mouth of the Rio Bravo
was about half-way from the Bahze to Vera Cruz,
and so as grantees, from France of Louisiana, we
claimed to the Rio del Norte, though the Spanish
settlement of Santa Fé was at the head of that
river.   France,from whom we had received Louis- '
siana, utterly disclaimed ever having even raised
such a pretension.   Still we made the best of the
claim that we could, and finally yielded it for the
Floridas, and for the line of the forty-second de-
gree of latitude from the source of the Arkansas
river to the South Sea.   Such was our claim; and
you may judge how much confidence Mr. Mon-
roe could have in its validity.   The great object
and desire of the country then was to obtain the
Floridas.    It was General Jackson's desire, and
in that conference with me to which I have here-
tofore alluded, and which it is said he does not
recollect, he said to me that so long as the Florida
rivers were not in our possession, there could be
no safety for our whole southern country.
But, sir, suppose you should annex Texas to
these United States; another year would not pass
Defore you would have to engage in a war for the
conquest of the Island of Cuba. What is now
the condition of that island' Still under the nom-
inal protection of Spain. And what is the con-
dition of Spain herself Consuming her own I
vitals in a civil war for the succession to the !
Ciown     Do you expect that, whatever may be '
the issue of that \\ir, she can íetain even the

motto to hei union cross of St   George and St
Andiew'    Mi   Chin man, do you  think I am
tic vding on fantastic grounds'    Let me tell you
a piece of history, not far íemote.    Sir, many
years have not passed away since an internal
revolution  in Spain subjected that countiy and
her king for a short time to the momentaiy gov-
ernment of the Cortes    That íevolution was fol-
lowed by another, by which, under the auspices
of a Ficnch fumy, with the Duke d'Angoulcme
at their hf id, rcidinand the Seventh was ustoit d
to a despotic tlnone, Cuba had followed the for-
tunes of the Cortes when they were ci owned with
victoiv, and when the counter revolution came,
the inh ibitants of the island, unceitain w hat was
to be then  destination, were for some time in
great perplexity what to do for themselves    Two
considerable parties aiose in the island, one of
which was for placing it u"der the protection of
Great Britain, and anothei was for annexing it
to the Confedeiation of these United States    By
one of these parties I have rtason to believe that
overtures were made to the Government of Gieat
Bntain.  By the othei / know that overtures were
made to the Government of the United States
And  I further know that secret, though  lrre-
sponsiole, assurances weie communicated to the
then P.esident of the United States, as coming
from  the   French Government,  that  they weie
secretly infoimed that the Bntish Government
had   determined  to   take   possession  of Cuba
Whether similar overtuies weie made to France
herself, I do not undeitake to say, but that Mr
George Canning, then the British Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs, was under no inconsid-
erable alai m, lest, undei the pupilage of the Duke
d'Angouleme,Feidinand the Seventh might com-
mit to thecommandei of aFiench naval squadion
the custody of the Moro Castle—a circumstance
also well known to me.   It happened that just
about that time a Ftench squadron of considerable
force was fitted out and received sailing oidcrs
for the West Indies, without formal communica-
tion of the fact to the Bntish Government, and
that as soon as it was made known to him, he
gave orders to the British Ambassador at Pans
to demand, in the most peremptory tone, what
was  the  destination  of that squadron, and  a
special and positive disclaimer that it was intended
even to visit the Havana, and this was made the
occasion of mutual explanations, by which Great
Britain, France, and the United States, not by
the  formal solemnity of a treaty, but by th<-
implied  engagement of mutual assurances  of
intention, gave pledges of honor to each other
I that neither of them should, in the then condition
| of the island, take it, or the Moro Castle, as its
citadel, from the possession of Spain.   This en-
gagement was, on all sides, faithfully performed,
but without it, who doubts that from that day
to this either of the three Powers might have
taken the island and held it in undisputed pos-
session '
At this time circumstances have changed; pop-
ular revolutions, both in France and Gi eat Bntain,
have, perhaps, curbed the spirit of conquest in
Great Britain, and France may have enough to
do to govern her kingdom of Algiers But Spain
is again convulsed with a civil war for the suc-
cession to herCiown; she has irretrievably lost
all her colonies on both continents of America
It is impossible that sue should hold much longer
a shadow of dominion over the Islands of Cuba
and Porto Rico, nor can those islands, in their
present condition, foim independent nations,
capable of protecting themselves. They must for
ages remain at thp meicy of Gieat Britain or
these United States, o¡ of both; Great Britain is
even now about to interfere in this war for the
Spanish succession If, by the utter imbecility
of the Mexican Confedeiacy, this revolt r ?']>■<■ u

authonty she has done it, she will ask you, in
return, by what authority you have extended your
sea coast fiom the Sabine to the Puo Biavo tohe
will ask you aquestion more peiplexin_r, namely
—by what authority you, with ficedom, inde-
pendence, and d< mociaey upon youi lips, aie
waging a war of extermination to foige new
manacles and fet eis, instead of those which are
falling fiom the hands and feet of man She will
cany emancipation and abolition with her in
every iolel of her ilag, while your stars, as they
mciease in numbers, will be overcast with the
murky vapors of oppression, and the only por-
tion of your banncis visible to the eye, will be
the blood-stained stupes of the taskmaster
Mi Chan man, are you leady foi all these wars'
A Mexican waiJ awar with Great Britain,if not
with Fiance' agencial Indian war' a set vile war'
and, as an inevitable consequence of them all, a
civil war' For it must ultimately terminate in a
war of colois as well as of races And do you.
imagine that while with your eyes open you aic-
willfully kindling, md then closing your eyes and
blindly rushing into them, do \ ou imagine that
while, in the very nature of things, your own
southern and southwestern States must be the
Flanders of these complicated wais, the battle
field upon which the last gieat conflict must ue
fought between slavery and emancipation' Do
you imagine that youi Congiess w.llhave no con-
stitutional authonty to mterfeie with the institu-
tion of slavery in any way in the States of this
Confederacy' Sir, they must and will intcrfeie
with it—peihaps to sustain it by war, perhaps to
abolish it by tieiti°s of peace, and they will not
only posst ss the constitutional power so to mtei-
fere, but they will be bound in duty to do it by
the express provisions of the Constitution 't«elf.
Fiom the instant that your slaveholding States
become the theater of war, civil, s^rvi't, or for-
eign, from that instant the war povveis of Con-
gress extend to interference with the institution
of slaveiy in every way by which it can be mter-
ferred with, fiom a claim of indemnity for slaves
taken or destroyed, to the cession of the State
burdened with slavery to a foieign power.
Sit, it is by virtue of this same war power, as
now brought into exercise by thi3 Indian war in
riorida, Alabama, and Georgia, that I vote for the
resolution before the committee. By vntie of
this, I have already voted in the couise of this
session to increase your standing army by a second
regiment of dragoons, to authonze youi Piesi-
dent to accept the services of ten thousand volun-
teeis, and to appropriate millions of the public
money to suppress these Indian hostilities—all
for the common defense, all for the general wel-
fare     And if, on this occasion, I have been com-
I pelled to avail myself of the opportunity to assign
' my reasons for voting against the first resolution
reported by fhe slavery committee, it is because
it was the pleasure of the majonty of the House
this morning to refase me the permission to assign
my reasons for my vote, when the question was
I put upon those resolutions themselves.
Sir, it is a melancholy contemplation to me, and
' raises fearful forebodings in my m.nd when I
consider the manner in which that repoi t and those
| resolutions have been disposed of by the House.
I have twice asked permission of this House to
offer two resolutions calling for information fiom
i the President upon subjects of infinite importance
I to this question of slavery, to our relations with
