D. 1870, to be again revived only by the exi-
gencies that called it forth. They ask for no
reduction or modification ; but for its entire
abrogation, being convinced from tho experi-
ence of the past three years that the tendency
of this enactment, is to sap the foundation of
public morals and to weaken the respect of the
people for tho necessary and salutary provis-
ions of the revenue system. Its unequal, odi-

be thought of in profound peace. Lot tho tax
be laid in any other way.

SHNATOIt I'ltOM 1'LORIDA.
Mr. OSBORN. I rise to present the cre-
dentials of Judge 0. B. Hart, who was elected
by the Legislature of Florida at its last session, to
take tho placc of my colleague, [Mr. Gilbert.]
The papers as they came into my hands are,
first, the certificate of the election of O. B.
llart to the Senate of the United States ; sec-
ond, an additional certificate of the election
of Ossian B. Hart to the United States Sen-
ate: and third, the petition of O. B. Hart to
the Senate of the United States.
My own impression, Mr. President, is that
rny colleague [Mr. Gilbert] was legally elected
by the Legislature of the State of Florida to
ins seat hero in the Senate; but since his elec-
tion there have been several incidental ques-
tions presented in the State which have dissat-
isfied certain members of the Legislature and
certain State officials, and led them to doubt
the legality of the election ; and with a view
of testing the question as to the legality of Mr.
Gilbert's election to the Senate this election
was held. 1 ask that the petition and accom-
panying papers be referred to the Judiciary
Committee, hoping that as soon as may jje
consistent with their duties the matter will be
fully investigated by them.
Tho VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator fro tn
Florida presents certain papers from the Legis-
lature of Florida and the Governor of Florida,
claiming that 0. B. Hart is elected United
States Senator in place of the sitting member,
Mr. Gilbert, whom they claim to have been
illegally elected, and asks that they be referred
to the Committee on the Judiciary.
Mr. DRAKE. 1 ask that the petition of
Mr. Hart be read.
Mr. OSBORN, One moment, if the Senator
pleases. I present also the journals of the
L'^islftturp. both in tho election of Senator
