Stanton, and for Companies A and K, First Veteran Infantry California Volunteers, to return to Fort Union, unless matters with reference to the Kiowas and Comanches demanded the further stay of these troops at or near Fort Bascom. The cavalry horses of Colonel Carson's expedition must be fed on hay as long as you have a pound at your post, particularly when the ground is covered with snow. Write to me at once and let me know all that has been done, or is doing, with reference to what is written above. I am completely in the dark with reference to your status, or who even is in command, as I cannot tell whether my orders have yet reached you. Report in full about the condition of your stock. I expected to have found Major McCleave here, and to have met Captain Witham en route to Las Cruces.

I am, sir, respectfully,

JAMES H. CARLETON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
