U. S. Infantry, the late and lamented provost-marshal-general of the Department of the Missouri, who literally sacrificed his life through his incessant devotion of mind and body to the interests of the service and for the benefit of the loyal people of Missouri. It is confidently hoped that all officers and employees connected with this bureau, throughout the State, will not forget the noble example they have lost, and will strive to emulate in every possible way the untiring energy, the sterling probity, and unflinching patriotism of their deceased chief.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Jefferson City:

Major Williams fails to get very full information as to the aggregate of Price's command. From Major Surridge, who is the hospital here, I learn there are three divisions, with an aggregate of 18,000 men and eighteen pieces of artillery. Ten pieces of artillery are in Shelby's division. The divisions are nearly of equal size, Shelby's being the largest. Marmaduke's division has three brigades, under General Clark, Colonel McCray, and Colonel Freeman; Tim Reves commands a regiment in Freeman's brigade. Fagan's division is the best and has three brigades, commanded by General Cabell, Colonel Slemons, and Colonel Dobbin. Shelby's division has but two brigade, but very large ones, commanded by Colonel Shanks and Colonel Jackman. Major Williams in his dispatch says there were four divisions, commanded from right to left, as follows: Shelby, Marmaduke, Fagan, Cooper, and the aggregate was about 20,000, with eighteen pieces of artillery. He says in the hospitals at Ironton the following regiments and batteries were represented: Mounted infantry, Morgan's, Monroe's, Hill's, Coleman's, Witherspoon's, Crandall's, Reves', Boone's, Crawford's, Gordon's, Cochran's, Wright's, Hodge's, and Slayback's; cavalry, Third, Fourth, Eighth, and Tenth Missouri; batteries, Zimmerman's, Gentry's command, as I have not heard of it as present except through Major Williams.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Jefferson City, Mo.:

If you think Price is certainly into Kansas suppose you let me send two regiments of infantry there from here, or at least the Tenth Kansas and Eighteenth Colored. I could get them through by the North Missouri road in time, I guess, to do some good. Please let me know where Price's main army is and his probable purpose.

THOS. EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
