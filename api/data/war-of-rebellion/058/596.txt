HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Russellville, January 21, 1864-8 p.m.

Major GEORGE W. DAY,

Commanding Cavalry:

I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your communication of yesterday, in which you offer to capture the enemy's artillery and force at Tazewell. The commanding general has concluded to give you the opportunity you seek, and for the object in view the following arrangements and instructions are given: The cavalry of Rucker's Legion will, as ordered last night, move to Bean's Station. You will, however, leave that force in charge of the next officer, with the instructions you have received, and report to General Vaughn for the men with which you are to make the movement against Tazewell. General Vaughn is ordered to place under of the men of Jones' brigade to swell your command to a force of 500 officers and men. With this force the commanding general desires you to make the movement you propose. Colonel Corns, with the remainder of Jones' brigade, will at the same time make a demonstration on Cumberland Gap. The success of your expedition depends upon your silence, secrecy, watchfulness, and rapidity.

With my best wishes for it, I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Russellville, January 21, 1864-9 p.m.

Major General W. T. MARTIN,

Commanding Cavalry:

I am in receipt of your note of 1 o'clock to-day, in which you report that the enemy is abandoning some of his property.

The commanding general directs me to say that he is evidently not recovered from the rout, and if you press him vigorously it will become a panic.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S.-To insure rapid communication with you as you move farther from us, please establish a fast line of couriers from wherever you may be to General Johnson's headquarters.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

G. M. SORREL,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Assistant Adjutant-General.
