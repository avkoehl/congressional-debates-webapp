loi>s of many of its creditors
But the money test cannot Complete the compari-
son between the two elates of agents Other con-
siderations of great weight, and some of sull graver
character, belong to the subject ftist, m point of
amenability The Government officers are amena-
ble to the Government, «subject to its laws and its
orders, liable to summary proceedings (or default,
and to be pursued by execution wherevei they go,
and responsible in person and in pre pertv, them-
selves and all their securities, foi all that n owing
by them. Not so with the banks They are the
creations of the State Governments, subject to State
laws, and having great influence over the enact-
ment of State laws which concern themselves The
States may protect them, and have protected them,
against the Federal demand' They have passed
nets to prevent the recovery of damage  v> hich the'
charters had fixed, and to prevent execution against
the banks themselves, unless the creditor •> would
consent to receive his debt in current bank notes
This is what has been done, it is what is now done,
and here is the evidence of it
Mr B then exhibned a document, obtained from
the Department of State, containing the acts passed
by the legislatures of difTeient States since die
suspension of specie pajments m May 1 est Thev
were passed in States where theie weie eteposite
banks, then holding about thirtj millions ot public
money, standing in the name of the Treasurer of
the United States, or in the names oí disbursing
officers These acts, in some instances, reduced
the damages which depositors and holders of notes
were entitled to recover, and, in some instances,
denied execution against the bank, unless the
creditor would endorse upon it that cuircnt notes
should be receivable Mr B said he had seen no
instance in which these acts made any exception
in favor of the United States , and he read the
titles of several of the acts, and the names of tne
States in which they were passed, and lelcrred to
the Senators from those States to saj whether there
were any exception No Senator answerm,, m the
affirmative, Mr B resumed, and said that licit
was an insurmountable objection to tin. tutuic em-

the Slate Governments Every consuleiation of
harmony and mutual independence should foibtd
the possibility of such occurrences for the futuie
Again The depo-ite banks, whether a Nation il
Bank or catalogue of State banks, were the lucnds
of hish taxes and low appropriations They went
for surpluses, for the accommodation of themselves
and a few of their friends They went for taxing
the nation to the uttermost, and stinting appiopria-
tions 1o the minimum, that enormous surprises
should remain in their hards for lo'ns to them-
selves and lnends He (Mr B ) had a table in
his hand, obtained from the Treasury Department,
and showing the annual amount of ba'ances in the
Treasury from the foundation of the Government
to the present time, and which he would read It
■was valuable for two purposes 1 To show how
little need the Government has for large balances,
2 How large these balances became when the
banks were povteiful and 'he Government con-
nected with them In the first years oí the Govern-
ment, the banks were few m number, and compara-
tively weak, and then the surpluses stood thus

1800      -    -    8,633,311
Thus, during this period of twelve years, when
the National Bank had but ten millions of capital,
and State banks were few and weak, the average
surplus for twelve years did not amount to one
million of dollars Now foi a diflerem picture

Here is ane thci season ol five ve irs of great
power in the binks, -ui 1 ed elo e connection with
Hie m by the I c ¡eial Government The result is,
an average balance, that is to sav, an annual sur-
plus, of about tvvent} seven millions of dollars'
What a comment upon the connection between
Bank and State1 A connection which exhibits
ihe Peder il Treasury is a men appendage to a
rising, flying, plungtug and (along billoon Wi
who have been here for sonic ye irs have <een the
inside woikin? of this connection, and have seen
the votes which created these enoane us suipluses,
votes to promote a1! taxa'ion—to p-f vent til re
duction of lates—and to prove it all p ssiblc ap-
propriations even for the defence of the country, and
for the completion of the fortifications, and ue have
sren these votes regulaily coming from the friends
of the banks To complete the pn ture, it i suiP
cient lo say that the banks had their second catas-
tiophe, in time of pece, in May last, and that now
the balance m the Treasury is low enough1
Mr B said, he had for years pom'ed out the
Bank oí the United Slat's, « hile tne depository of
tne public monejs, as the ally of taxes, and the
enemy of appropriations, he had made the same
remark upon the local deposite banks almost as
soon as they weie in operation, and he had now
given the evidence to show the justice of the appli-
cation of this character to them both. It was a
most fatal objection to all connection with those
bank , an objectietn from which the Government
agents would be wholly free With the mints and
individual officers, to keep the public moneys, there
would be no interest here 10 create surpluses for
the benefit of banks and their favorites.
A third ansner to this objection is, that it goes to
the form of our Government, and impeaches the
capacity of the people to administer their own Go-
vernment The objectien is, that the agents se-
lected by the Government, and responsible to it,
cannot be trusted to keep the public moneys, and,
therefore, the custody oí the money must be con-
fided to bank directors, wno are not appointed by
the Government, nor responsible to the people.
This is the objection, and, upon its face, it im-
peaches the capacity of the people lo administer
their own Government, and to take care ol their
own property. This is an inevitable inference;
and, perhaps, another inference will also result;
«amelo, that if banks are necessary to Ihe Federal
Government, she will have the same power to
e/ealeas to adopt these institutions
A fourth objection made to the Independent Trea-
suiy is, that it will hoard specie—thai it will cause
the Government to become an immense misei,
heralding in the deep recesses oí vaults, and con-
fining with bolts, bars, and safes, a vast accumula-
tion of gold and silver Sir, the table of balances
which I have read explodes this objection It
shows that the Government has no balances of any
consequence, except when it is connected with
banks When free from that connection, or when
the batiks are too weak to exert an influence over
the public counsels, the surplus on hand is next to
nothing, a million per annum m the eather stages
ol the Ge>veiiimeni,and two millions per annum in
later time's The table shows how little need there
is leu any suiplus, (oi a is notorious thai the Go-
vernment inichuie* worked far better when it was
a touch and go business with the 1 leasury, lhan it
ever elid with its ten, twenty, thirty, and iorty mil-
hems of surplusses There will be no surplus to
be hoarded il the Gin eminent can succeed in break-
ing lis connection with the banks Economy can
then be practice il, is in II a > professed It can then
be practised by those who ate really in favor of it.
Mr 1! said, that at the evtia sess on he had
given it as his opinion thit the payment ot tue
I'tderoI icvenues in gold antl silver vwuld not
occasion more than ieuii or dye millions ot dol ars
to be takf-n out oí circulation , in other worels, that
four or five millions would accomplish the annual
pa}merit of the whole levenue A further study
ol ihe subject, and a view oí the table of balances
which he had jiisi pre ented, induced him to be-
lieve that two or three millions would be sufficient.
One million was (otmd to be suflment in (he first
tuelve years of th Government, and two millions
in the five years from 1818 to 1822, inclusive The
same amount would have been equally sufficient
at all other times He was against surpluses, he
was against any iinuicul calculation for leaving
anj amount whitever m the Treasury, he was
opposed to any scheme of fmance which had for its
basis any reseivc of money in the Federal Trea-
sury This was an old subject with him [Mr B ]
He had made his acquaintance with it twelve years
ago He had then tried his young hand, ior the
first time, on a financial subject, and on res dutions
submitted by himself to repeal so much of the
Sinking Pund act of 1817 as directed a reserve of
two millions per annum to be kept in the Treasury.
He had then shown it to be an unnecessary pre-
caution , that it was far better lo cut down taxes to
the estimated expenditure, and invent the Govern-
ment wuh a contingent authority to borrow the
two n ílhons in the event of a need for it to meet
appropriations before Congress would assemble
This was his opinion twelve }ears ago , it was his
opinion now. He was opposed to any plan for
leaving a surplus dollar in ihe Treasury, he was
opposed to the issue oi Tr. asuiy notes to supply
deficiencies; he was for the contingent authority lo
borrow, if necessary, a small sum to meet appro-
priations, and (hen paying it ofT out of the first
surplus. In this w ay, and by increasing and di-
minishing the amount for the flexible objects of ex-
