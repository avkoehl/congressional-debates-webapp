RICHMOND, VA., January 11, 1865.

General W. J. HARDEE, Charleston, S. C.:

Yours of the 8th instant received. Your plan seems to me judicious and I hope may, with Divine favor, prove successful. General Beauregard is probably by this time at Hood's headquarters, and if troops have not already started to aid you he will, I am assured, make every exertion to re-enforce you from that army as rapidly as possible. You must use all means to obtain men from Georgia, either reserves, militia, or recruits. General Cobb can more effectually aid you by having his headdquarters at Augusta. If your relations to Governor Brown enable you to influence him that is the means sto be employed.

JEFF'N DAVIS.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,
