foi it led, as I have he ird, to an expression of sen-
timent, ft om one of our mechanics {Mr Haib;,)
which struck rae as noble bejond all praise He
said he w ondered what could be mr-ant by address-
ing to the industrious classes, particu ai'y, a 1 in-
flammatory app 'ai* agamst toe msti utions of the
country—as íl they were noi a part of the com-
munity as much interested n its order and peace
as any other—as if they had no ties of sympathy
or connection with their fellow-citizens—above all,
as if they had not mtel'igerce and knowledge
enough to take care of their (wn interests, but
were reduc d to a state of perpetual pupilage and
infancy, and needed the officio s protection of self-
constituted gu^dians1 S i, that was a sentiment
worthy oí a fueman, and vv ncli may be rec ir^ed,
with honor, among the «.pwngs of leroes
Mr Chairman, I thank the comm tte° for the at-
tention with which it has honored mt I have de-
tained it long but T was full of the subject which
appears to me to be one or v ast importance, in all us
bearings I ¡-ave spoken what I felt and thought,
wi'hout reference to party But I will say one
word to those with whom I have generally act-
ed on this floor I have heaid that some of
them disapprove this measure, but are disposed to
vote for it to ob ige their friends Sn, this is a
strange ?nd a great mistake A true friend ought
to be a faithful counsellor. Let them remember
the deep reproach which the great poet puts m the
mouth of one of his heroes
Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause,
When I spoke darkly what I puipo^ed,
Or turned an eye of doubt upon my face'-----
SPEECH OF MR. WISE
Or Vir&ima
In, the House of Representatives September 27, 1837
—Against the postponement of the fourth instal-
ment under the deposite act of 1836
Mr WISE said he was m no sense prepared to
discuss this bill and were it not that he alone of
the opposition voted, the vote was proverbial]} 43
democrats and Wise' against the distribution bul—
distribution bill it w as, and w as there not a seem-
ing inconsistency between the tote he then gave
and the one he now should give against this mea-
sure, he would remain silent But (said Mr W )
I am pecuharlj situated, and must explain mj po-
sition t shall v o'e against this bill to postpone the
fonrih instalment uidi r the lw of 185G and, in
asmuch as I voitd against tne law to create that in-
stalment, I must explain
What a change has   come over the spirit of our
dream' '   Sir, this all does seem like a dream to
me    But yestci day—as it were, last weeL—w e w ere
debating and deliberating upon the great and sol
emu question, Whut shall be done inth out immense
suiplus icicnw?    We were  told b) the President,
by the partv, bv the press, that the nation was m a
state of the most exuberant prospent} ,   that the
Treasury was overflow mg with millions and count-
less streams of revenue were still pouring in fiom
customs and from lands    We saw one of the
strongest fiiends of the Admmistiation m the Sen
ate (Mr Benton) pioposmg bills ot appropriation
for the most extended worko of extravagart expen-
diture andpiovidmg for the most magnificent out
lav oi a splendid Government    In two sessions of
Congiess we saw mole than eight} millions appro
priated b) law, and w e saw  an opposition, jealous
ot Exeeuliv e pow er   striving to curtail Executive
patronage bv putting a nominal surplus of more
than thirt   seven millions out  of the  Execute e
hand1   All tins was but a veai past—in June, 1836
and a \ ear m the existence ot a Gov eminent is but
a day    What heai w e what see vv e now '    What
do w e hear and see in Septembei   ih37i   Sn we
are now called together at in unusual time under
the most extraordinai} emergencies, bj an oihcial
proclamation of disti ess—duress among the pco
pie, and distress m   the affaus of Government
What arc the recommendations ot the President 1
What are the propositions ol the Committee of
Wavsand Means'!    Yes'erdaj sn \esterda\ there
were sixteen millions of unexpended balances oi
appropriations for 1830 thirty-seven millions and a
half of surplus, five millions reseived for contm
gencies, sixty millions, or more, m the 1 leasury
and now, sir though tne States have been paid but
three instalmprts   though   appropriations  to  the
amount of fifteen millions, have been suspended,
we are toll thaf the Treasury is bankrupt! Sir,
look at the bills on youi taole After -ll this pros
penty, so soon after all this richness and snpeiflui-
ty of means, of a sudden we see a bill to postpone
the fourth instalment to be paid the States, a bill to
issue ten millions of incontrovertible Treasury
notes, a bill of bankruptcj ptoposed, a senes ot
acts, like fishing nets, put out to draw m your small
remnants of resources to replenish our exhausted
coffers, aseries of measures to rake togethei the
small change of Gov ernment, which lies scattered
in the places where the bulk of our tieasures w ere
supposed to be' How came this change"! What
means this immense and sudden v lassitude t What
has produced this scene of loss and rum and con-
fusion1 Sir, it may surprise some it does not sur-
prise me It is exactl) as I alwa) s thought it w ould
be—it was all humbug You nev er had the mone}
it was a delusion, the people were deceived and
imposed upon One reason why the Government
opposed the deposite act w as because it was sure,
in the end, to expose the fact that w e had all along
been toppling on the giddy height of a delusiv e and
fals  piospentv ever verging upon an ovei whelm-
ing catastrophe1
The catastrophe has come and overw helmed us,
we are now bankrupt, and we are asked to take
back this gift we made to the States m the moment
of our delusion and folly, to postpone the fourth in-
stalment until furlhei provision by law I will not
vote to do it I will vote against this bill for the
same reason the very same reason, I voted against
the deposite a< t itself
This bill is, as w as that, m fraud of legislation
I will say it boldl}    that every word said by the
young gentleman from Kentuck) (Mr   Menefee)
is true    That act was a distribution bill, not a fíe
posite act and so understood bv most who voted for
it    It vv as openly advocated asa distribution bill
and opposed bv me on this flooi  asa distiibution
bill    By the le iders at least, of parties uwasnevei
intended as any thing else than as a distribution
bill, and they never expected that adollai deposited
with the States would ever be returned to the Gen
eral Government    It was a disguised measure, and
therefore I opposed it    It said one thing and meant
another, it was a deposite bill  on its face anda
distribution bill m the intention of its legislators
It is true the great question w as, What shall be
done with the sniplus revenue'! It was a great
souice of corruption, most of the opposition feared
that so gteat a money powei left with a corrupt Ex-
ecutiv e w ould ensla c us the plans 'o dispose of it
vveie numeious almost infinite there was a great
and meeoncilable diversity of opinion among most
of us, the land bill had failed It was at such a
moment when I as well as man) others, began to
be willing to dispose of it in almost anyway, to
take it from the hands ot power and jts parasites—
hands which seemed tograsp it with an non hold—
it w as then I sa\ I saw that truly gallant and great
man, who is alvv a1 s wide aw ake and alvv avs knows
when to stnke foi his pol'cj who has ahí av s been
consistent and constant m one lmeof policv, Hlnry
Cl ii w ho, if he be the father of the American sv s-
tem, has ever supported it with a master hand I
saw him convei t the vv old distribution into deposite,
and the public money into the public lands I saw
him bring forth that deposite act, and though oft
baffled, though comparative]} weak in the numbers
of his partv clearly in a minority v. et it seems im-
possible to resist him he w ill be felt, vv ill be heard
I saw him carr} his measure, in spite of all, suc-
cessfully triumphantly' He carried the substitute
foi his land bill in a wav most surprising to me I
saw the State lights men, of the stionge'* calibre,
earned along with him, and aiding m the stippoit
and success of'the distribution bill
Sn I regarded that bill as the ver) acme of the
Amencan system I was astonished (o see how the
strait jacket politicians were caugnt bv it Even
effort was made to obtain mv vote foi it some of
mv Staie lights ftiends endeavored most stretmous-
1} topievail on me not to vote against it No, I
told them thev weie exceeding the most ultra lati-
Uidmanans I could not volt foi t ltwasuncon
stitutional
It went bevend the s\-tem of internal imp o< e
meuts bv the Genera] Gov eminent and bevond the
tanfl it went not onlv to bin tin sections and dis-
tricts but it was at once a wholesale j urchiv of
eveiy State in the Union It went to buv. up the
bodies politic,whichweie theonl) if ¿te/wert am
check' upon this mammoth central Government
I contended with my then State rights friends that
a distribution bill went to fix tariff and internal im-
provements both upon our policy We would di-
vide out some thirty or fort} millions to the Spates,
and they would return to the crib, and forever here-
after seek the hand that fed them I reminded
gentlemen that the States had not the unobtrusive
and silent means of laying and collecting taxes, by
duties and imposts, which this Geneial Govern-
ment has, that the> all had large schemes before
them, ami it would coirupt them at once, if they
weie permitted to taste of the bait which the de-
posite act laid in their w ay, that it would enable
them to complete their works of internal improve
ment, and the act was but an indiiect mode of car-
rying on internal improvements by the General
Government, that thes} stem of distribution msuitd
at OHceahigh tariff and an immense revenue The
States having on"e tasted of the sweets oí millions,
easily collet ted foi their various u-.es, would ery
like leeches foi mo.e, more, until taxes would he-
come intolerable, and the Government become con-
solidated Nor would the constant demand of the
States for more Treasury pap diminish the warts
or stmt the supplies of the General Government
The largest possible revenue would be raised, in-
finite]} beyond all reasonable wants here and a
constant sci amble w ould certainly occur among the
large and small States in Congress for appropi na-
tions of as much as could possibly be got by each
State before the day of distribution came, and then
each would come m still for an equal share of what
was left Thus would the most extensive and
alarming scheme of high revenues and of extrava-
gance of which the mind of man had ever con
ceived be fastened both upon the State and Federal
Governments, and it was useless to contend for
strict tonsti uction and limited powers, if such a
measure w as to prevail
I urged other objections in vain This measure
of distribution was inseited in a bill to regulate the
deposite of the public money which recognised and
sanctioned every principle which had been relied
on by Mr Taney for the removal of the public de-
posites from the Bank of the United States The
bill, so far as it was a deposite bill, left the entire
custody and control of the public money to the Ex-
ecutive You know, Mi Speaker, for then you
were chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means, that the Administration proposed, the very
next session after the removal of the deposites a
bill to regulate the public deposites precisely similar,
with the exception of the distribution featurs, or
dtposite orthe suiplus with the States, and the op-
position then would not touch such a bill Mr
Bmne), a distinguished representative irom Penn-
sylvania, then offered an amendment, requiiins; the
deposite banks to have at least one fifth of the amount
of their deposites in specie, the "metallic cuirenev"
party refused to adopt that amendment, that bill
was not passed, and the public deposites remained
three years m the State banks, without, regulation
by law Yet, m 1836, when the same bill w as pro-
posed, with this bait m it, all went foi it en masse—
without scruple without requiring any specie secu
rity from the banks and leaving the Gov ernment
funds and five millions excess wholly at the discre-
tion of the Secretary ot the Treasury Sir, the
people had become dissatisfied with the unregulated
state of our finances, they had begun to clamor for
some regulation by law, and being unable to legu-
late the puolic deposites under proper limitations and
íestrictions in lcspect to their safety and the power
over the j nnlic money or the Executive, mv policy
was to leavt the p lobe money wholh in the hands
and at the will of the President and to hold him
responsible ior that condition of things b"'bre the
people u ml i could be placed under the enstodv of
law bv piop->r legislation If we had re mned to
mil constituents with the repo-t that the Executive
still held the pihlic purse without the «anction of
C in less thev would have icmtdied the disease of
t'io i un'rv, b-f re this dav, and this dav of distress
would never iave come That t'ep isite act, m
