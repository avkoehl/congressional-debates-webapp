missioners assenting to it. It shall be competent for
each Government to name one person to attend the
commissioners as its agent, to present and support
claims on its behalf, and to answer claims made upon
it, and to represent it generally in all matters con-
nected with the investigation and decision thereof.
"The high contracting parties hereby engage to
consider the decision of the commissioners as abso-
lutely final and conclusive upon each claim decided
upon by them, and to give full effect to such decis-
ions without any objection, evasion, or delay
whatsoever."
That is, each party agrees to pay thereby to
every citizen or subject of the respective par-
ties the sum that this commission may award.
Then it goes on to provide the period of time
within which these commissioners are to exer-
cise their duties. And then in the sixteenth
article you find a significant provision showing
the difference between providing for the inter- i
position of each Government for the claims of
its citizens and its national assertion of a claim
upon its own account, although it may be for
injuries, and it almost always must be for in-
juries committed upon its citizens. Article
sixteen in the last clause provides that "the
whole expense of thecommission "—that is the
commission of which I have been last reading—
''including contingent expenses, shall be de-
frayed by a ratable deduction on the amount
of the sums awarded by the commissioners,
provided always that such deduction shall not
exceed the rate of five per cent, on the sums
so awarded."
And then it provides that " the high con-
tracting parties engage to consider the result
of the proceedings of this commission as full,
perfect, and final settlement of all" the claims
of these various citizens and corporations
referred to.
With that treaty itself before your eyes,
Mr. President, if you did not know this prior
constant course of the exercise of the treaty-
making power where the right of the citizen
or the subject was the one to be enforced, and
where the indemnity was to be made to the
citizen or the subject as such, you cannot fail
to see 011 the face of the treaty alone that its
framers have employed, in the two respects that
I have referred to, entirely different language,
and we must presume for entirely different pur-
poses. In the one they have spoken of the claims
presented by the United States and insisted
upon for indemnity for the acts of certain ves-
sels in respect to which it was alleged that
her Majesty's Government was the accessory
of the belligerent with whom we were at war ;
in the other they have provided in terms for
the claims of the respective citizens and sub-
jects of the two countries upon the other
wherein the two countries were to be medium
of interposition upon principles of comity,
courtesy, and international law, in order that
those claims might be asserted; and they have
provided in the first case, not that there shall
be any deduction from the allowances, eveu
if there be a board of assessors, in order to
defray the expenses of the litigation, because
the two Governments being the sole parties a
deduction would be a mere delusion; but in
the other case, where the two Governments
were acting as the representative of private
claimants, as their trustee, it provides as many
of the prior treaties had done, that there shall
be a deduction from the allowances to the
priyate claimants, enough to pay the expenses
ol these two agencies in bringing the matter
to a determination.
Thus, Mr. President, it seems to me to be
perfectly evident that by the treaty itself, in the
light of the history that preceded it, or with-
out that light upon the face of the treaty
the sum of money which has been awarded
to us by the tribunal at Geneva, it that
award was made in conformity to the treaty,
was a sum awarded to the nation and not to
individuals, and that it was awarded to the
nation withoutany stint or limitation 111 respect
to the uses to which the nation might apply it,
and that these individual inquiries as to the
classification of injuries were only the elements
that went to make up the sum total that might
be allowed.
But, Mr. President, this tribunal did not
undertake to decide beyond the treaty. It did
not, as I construe its decision, undertake to
say that any private claimant in any character
was entitled to any standing at all in respect
to a claim upon this fund, It only undertook
to classify, as one of the articles of the treaty
required it to classify, the vessels in respect
to which it might be found that her Majesty's
Government had been an accessory in the bel-
ligerence of the confederate States, and having
ascertained those vessels and decided that her
Majesty's Government was liable for their acts
to us as acts of belligerence accessory to the
acts of a belligerent, and not for any illegal
destruction of the private property of citizens
of the United States, it then proceeds to decide
that certain other claims that we make, as for
prospective profits, as for the expense of
chasing confederate cruisers, as for unearned
freights, as for a variety of things, are inadmis-
sible as going to show that the sum we claim
is more than we are entitled to have. It then
goes on to say as a final conclusion:
"The tribunal making use of the authority con-
ferred upon it by article seven of the said treaty, by
a majority of four voices to one, awards to the United
States a snm of $15,500,000 in gold as the indemnity
to be paid by Great Britain to the United States fur
the satisfaction of all the claims referred to the con-
sideration of the tribunal, conformably to the pro-
visions contained in article seven of the aforesaid
treaty; and in accordance with the terms of article
eleven of said treaty, the tribunal declares that all
the claims referred to in the treaty, as submitted to
the tribunal, are hereby fully, perfectly, and finally
settled."
Thus, Mr. President, you have in the decis-
ion of the tribunal itself, not a classification
of the claims of citizens in an award for the
indemnification of citizens, but an award fol-
lowing the treaty, which gives to the United
States, upon certain principles that it adopts
in order to reach a sum that it may give, a
certain sum of money as the indemnity that
Great Britain owes to it for having been acces-
sory. to an act of belligerence committed in a
state of public war by another belligerent
against us, and not for any act or wrong that
it had committed against any citizen of the
United States, for it had not done it as such.
So it appears to me that we have no difficulty
in coming to the result that this money which
has been awarded to us belongs to the people
of the United States, and it is for them, through
their Representatives in Congress, to determine
what disposition ought to be made of it. There
is no obligation, so far as I can understand it,
of honor, or of law, or of public policy, which
can constrain us in the slightest degree in
respectto this money to do any other thing than
that which we consider, looking to ourselves
alone and to our citizens alone, to be right.
Then we come to the question as to what is
right. The Committee on the Judiciary, in
reporting this bill, presented what they thought
under the circumstances would be right. It
must be remembered that the means of de-
fending property upon the high seas, the great
highway of nations, is not so perfect as it is
upon land ; for, as all nations have a right to
travel there, you can have no forts and no ex
elusive possession there. Therefore the duty
of the Government to the protection of citi-
zens' property upon the high seas may be of a
somewhat higher degree than its duty in re-
spect to the protection of their property upon
land for the reason that I have stated, that
within their own territories they can exclude
everybody else ; they are not obliged to decide
any questions as to neutrality or the want of it,
becauso no nation under any circumstances has
a right to infract its territory. Standing thus
upon a different principle from that of making
compensation to citizens who were loyal in
the southern Stales for losses on land, we
thought we might, as an act of justice and pro-
priety, pay to those who were the real suffer-
ers by these confederate cruisers, whose forces
were augmented by the aid of her Majesty and
for which this money was obtained, what they
had lost. And having done that, we pro-
vide that the sufferers directly, the owners
of ships and cargoes, officers, seamen, every-
body whose property or whose person has
suffered a direct loss by the acts of the vessels
in respect of which the tribunal found her
Majesty's Government to have been accessory,
shall be paid for their real losses, their actual
losses. If they have received indemnity by
having paid a premium in order that some one
should insure them, then of course to that ex-
tent they ought not to be paid: they have been
made good.
Then we have taken the next step that ap-
peared to us the perfectly logical one from
that. If this be not a trust, if it be a matter
of national right and of national recovery, the
next step logically follows that the insurance
companies who may have paid to the citizen
who had thus received a direct loss the sum
of his loss, is not entitled to make any claim
either upon the generosity or the justice of
the Government, if he himself, be he corpora-
tion or person, has not been the loser in that
class of business that he undertook. If the
insurer has taxed the people of the United
States by his charges for insurance, which
runs right down through fre'ights and cargoes
and sales until at last the consumer pays the
burden, if he has made himself good for a
given loss by this tax which he has spread
over the whole country, in its commerce, in
its industry, and in its consumption, there is
no ground of equity that we can perceive upon
which he is entitled to say, " I will take from
the Treasury of the United States a double
compensation and will thereby realize a profit
which out of the ordinary course of my busi-
ness I had made good before, and thus gain
by the loss of my fellow-citizens." ■ So we
have introduced a provision into this bill,
without enlarging upon it now, which excludes
all insurance companies who have made profit
out of their war risks; but those who did not
make profit out of their war risks we provide
to make good their losses, standing in the
place of the insured to the extent that their
war risks did not make them good.
There were of this same class of claims, if
you call them claims, this same class of rights^
several hundred thousand dollars it may be of
the property of the United States that was
destroyed directly, so that if this were a trust
at all, the United States would be entitled to
come in-its own court and in its own favor to
get the value of some of its ships that were
destroyed, and some of its charter parties and
insurance, &c., that were made on charter
parties it had taken up, to make itself good to
this extent; but in the view the committee
took of it, that this was a sum of money that
belonged to the nation, of course as we are
only providing to the extent we think we
ought to go at this time for people who suf-
fered spccial injuries, it is not necessary to
take any account ol that. The balance that
will be left in the Treasury after paying these
special claims will be quite sufficient to make
good that, even if you put it-upon the ground
of a trust.
The scope of the bill, then, is based simply
upon the theory that this sum of money which
we have recovered is a sum of money that
belongs to the nation and does not belong to
any citizen; that it is the money of the peo-
ple ; that it is not charged with any trust what-
ever, and, therefore, it is only upon principles
of public policy and natural justice that we
provide for these direct sufferers of the class
that I have named and upon the principles
that I have thus briefly and imperfectly set
forth. If after this there shall be a sum of
money still left, it will be a question afterward
for the United States to determine, it it shall
be raised, what disposition might propeny
be made toward making good the losses ol
