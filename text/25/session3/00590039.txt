Constitution to restore peace and orderand safety
Thanks for lus fhmnces and fearlessness1 he has
ict< d cm i.,etically and prudently, and Mr McK
hoped the crisis wag past, and that the difficulties
winch had arisen might be peaceably and consti-
tution il'y sealed He s ud he would vote for the
ixsol Hiorts, although he had been opposed to the
introduction of the exciting topic into this Hall
Mr BEATTY regretted as much as any gen-
tleman theie the excited feeling that had been
got up in that House, but he appealed to them
all to say whence it had arisen How calmly
and coolly these gentlemen can call the assembled
people of Pennsylvania a mob' But to denounce
the Democracy of the country as a mob, when,
perchance, the people were against it, was but
another evidence of their vindictive feeling against
them The resolution was a plain and substan-
tive proposition, having foi its object merely to
get at the truth, and why, then, all this severity
of denunciation? Why so much feeling about
it, as though the truth should be stifled >
But Mr B insisted that the time had never
existed in Pennsylvania which would justify the
Gov ernor in calling out the troops to his aid So
much for the gentleman'a veracity! Heptesumed
the state of excited feeling under which he spoke
made him foiget the truth But it seemed the
time was come when the truth could not be told
to gentlemen who were so very sensitive under
it
Mr BIDDLE said that as the decision made
excluded facts, but seemed to tolerate assertions,
he was not inclined to pursue the discussion on
what he felt must be unequal terms He had not
impeached the motives of his colleague, [Mr
Fry,] but ht had been struck at what seemed a
suspicious black privateei streak about the leso
lution, and he had pointed to Uaccordingly in the
way of caution It seems (hat the mob which
broke up legislative proceedings at Harnsbuig is
the Demociacy It might, peihaps, be asued, as
the mob hid disappeared, what had become of
the Demociacy, m the view of gentlemen who
insisted on the identity > But, sir, when shall we
have an end of this miserable abuse of the word
Demonac'i ' Let gentlemen deteimme dates and
principles If by Democracy be meant a fixed
and deep conviction of the capacity of the people
for self government, he would yield to no one in
a c'aim to the title At home and abioad he had
learned that, with all its tuimoil and agitation,
our form of Government best rmmstPis to the
gieat purpose for which all government is insti-
tuted If dates aie to control, he would like to
compaie notes with a distinguished Senator from
Pennsylvania, who had become a newspaper
wntei on this subject He would take the late
war with Gieat Britain as a starting point
Mi B concluded by saying he would vote for
the resolution, however he might deprecate the
ímflammatoi y air which had needlessly been given
to it
Mi Br ATT Y regretted exceedingly that his
colleague had worked himself into such a passion
about this matter Now, Mr B would not say
a vv ord to offi nd any one, but if gentlemen in that
House eombmed their efforts to deter him from
speaking what he knew was true, they would find
themselves mistaken in their effoits He was not
the man, either in this House or out of it, to re-
tract any thing which he had said Now,he would
unhesitatingly and unqualifiedly assert that there
was no mob in Harrisburg at all It was a bug-
bear existing only m the imagination of certain
gentlemen, and falsely asseverated by cei tain cor-
rupt individuals,, who wished to persuade the
people of Pennsylvania that there was a mob at
Harrisburg, in older to cover over and conceal
the iniquities of an Administration that has been
imsiuling that State for the last thiee years
I hese men want the people to believe there is a
mob, so that they might escape in the mist But
it was the habit of those silk stocking gentry to
call the Democracy of the country a mob, though
he could tell them they knew nothing about mobs
in the pan of the country he came from He de-
nied the existence of a mob at Harrisburg It
was an assemblage of many of the most respecta
ble and intelligent people of Pennsylvania, merely
looking on, as they had a peifcet right to do, at
the proceedings of their Legislature, and because
aset of eo wai d I y and treacherous knaves are afraid
to meet the people face to face, and escaped through
back windows, pursued only by their own guilty
consciences, they attempt to raise a great hue and
cry that a mob is at their heels And so is it here
When we offer a resolution merely asking for in-
formation, the propriety of procuring which no
one dare question, we are then told that our mo
tive is to excite the people and add fuel to a flame
enkindled and kept alive by themselves'
The resolution was then agreed to, with but
few dissenting voices
PETITIONS,  ETC.
There being no other business before the Chair,
Petitions and memorials weie then presented
by Messrs PARMENTER, BRIGGS, GREN
NELL, and REED, of Massachusetts
[Mi Pírmevtfr presented the petition of
Henry Hatch, for indemnity on account of Tienen
spoliations prior to 3800, of Mary Pase, for revo-
lutionary pension ofSylvanus Wood,foi increase
of pension, of Levi Brisham and 24 others, of
Dunstable, Massachusetts, for the rejection of
proposals for the admission into the Union of
States whose constitution may tolerate siaveiy,

Chelmsford, Massachusetts of Sally Woods and
46 other women, ot Dunstable, Massachusetts,
and Zetias Blown and loothcis, citizens of Shu
ley, Massachusetts, for the immediate abolition

Mi GRENNELL presented a petition from
Nouhfield, Massachusetts, foi opening negotia
tions and international intercouise with Hayti,
which u as refened to the Committee on I oieign
Affans
Mr WISE moved a reconsideration of that
lefcrence
Mi HOWARD thought the genJeman had
better let it go to the committee, for these peti-
tions had con e in every yea*
Mi WISE could not, loi he tegardi d it as a
subject of v, hoicsalt. amalgamation, incoiporating
a black Republic with a white one
Mr &RENJNELL denied that it was eithei the
one or the other
The pe ltion, however, giving rise to debate,
was ordered to lie over
Mi RELD presented a similar petition fiom
Nantucket
Mr  WISE obiected to its reception
Mr ADAMS called for the yeas and nays,
which were ordered
Mr A then proceeded to address the House
at length, in suppmt of the right of petition, and
especially in reference to this particular question,
showing the expediency of an early recognition
of the Republic of Hayti
Mr WISE insisted that these petitions were
part and parcel of abolition, and he read the pen
tion at length, which asked, also, for the aboh
tion of slaveiy in the District of Columbia, the
non admission of any new slave State, &c
Befoie the question was taken,
On motion of Mi GRENNELL, the House
adjourned
IN SENATE
TrjibDAY, December 18, 1838
The PRESIDENT submitted a commumca
tion from the Secretaiy of the Treasury, inclos
mg a report from the Commissioner of the Gen-
eral Land Office, in íegard to the operations of
that office during the year 1837, and part of 1838,
which was referred to the Committee on the Pub-
lic Lands
PFTITIONS,  ETC
Mr ROANE presented the petition of Captain
Robert White, an officer in the army of the Rev-
olution, for his commutation pay, which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judiciary
Mr BUCHANAN presented the petition of
Andiew Logan, of Davenport, Iowa, for two
quarter sections of land, to be used in the culture
of silk which was leferred to the Committee on
Agriculture                                                          1
Mr B said that he had rather a strange petition '
to present to the Senate but it came from a very
lespectab'e and scientific man, and, however
strange it might appear, it was vouched for by
sev ei al of the most respectable litei ary gentlemen
of the city of Philadelphia The petitioner was
Mr James, P Fspy, so deservedly celebrated for
his knowledge of meteoiology, who says that ho
has discovered the means of making it rain in a
tract of country at a period when there would be
no ram without the use of his process?   Mr Espy
proposed to make the expeument al his own ex-
pense , and he proposed that Congress should pass
an act engaging to reward him with a certain sum
1 if he succeeded   n making it ram ¡n a tract of
i country ten miles square a still highei sum if he
1 produced rain m a tiact of eountiy one thousand
square miles, a still highei Sum if he produced
I ram m a tract of five thousand square miles, and,
lastly, to give him a still gieatei compensation
I if he should cause the Ohio nver to be navigable
j all summer from Pittsburg to the Mississippi
I     Mr   B   observed   that  he was perfectly ac-
quainted with Mr  Espy, and knew him to be a
very i espectable man   He had no faith himself that
the gentleman possessed the power he claimed,
but it was true that theie were several things in
nature that philosophy had never yet dreamed of.
Mi   B then moved to refer the petition to the
Committee on Agriculture
Mi BEN TON observed that the Senator from
Pennsylvania, who introduced the petition, eould
not make tne motion which he would make—-that
gentleman had felt himself bound to treat this pe-
tition seuously, and move for its reference io a
committee He would move that the petitionee
have leave to withdiaw his petition and papers,
for reasons too obvious to lequire notice
Mr BUCHANAN said that he would rather
that the couise proposed by the Senator from
I Missoun should not be taken with the petition.
He scarcely knew himself what to say about it,
but he knew Mi Espy to be a highly respectable
and learned man, and knew that in the science of
meteorology there was scarcely a man in the Uni-
ted States his supcuor He haidly believed lttii
be in Mr Espy's power to make it ram, though
there were some sixorsevenof the most respect-
able literary gentlemen of the city of Philadel-
phia who expiessed the opinion that he proceeded
on highly philosophical prtnciples He hoped the
Senator fiom Missoun would permit the petition
to take the usual couise, and go to a committee,
and if that motion did not prevail, that it would,
at least, be suffered to he on the table
Mr CRITTENDEN would vote against the
proposition of the honoiable Senatoi from Penn-
sylvania, [Mr Buchanan,] foi the purpose of re-
cording his vote m favor of that of the gentleman
from Missoun, [Mr Benton ] He doubted very
much, whether, even if this thing was possible,
it would be good pokey to encourage the meas-
ure He would be very sorry that any individual
should have the power that this gentleman pro-
fesses to have, more especially from the annun-
ciation that ne was about to take the Ohio river
under his especial protection Why, sir, he might
enshroud us in continual clouds, and, indeed,
falsify the promise that the earth should be no
more submerged And if he possesses the power
of causing ram, he may also possess the power of
withholding it, and, in his pleasure, instead of
giving us a navigable river, may present us with
rocks and shoals and sandbars He thought that
this would be too dangerous a power to intrust
to any individual, unless we had a counteracting
powei, capable of prompt application—without
we had some very summary process of manu-
facturing sunshine This, indeed, had been at-
tempted by some Flench philosopher, but he
thought with no great suecess He was also op-
posed to this scheme on another account—it had
too much the appeaiance of a sub Treasury about
I it, a hoarding up of clouds and vapors to be dis-
I pensed at will by an individual He thought the
I proper course in relation to it was that indicated
by the motion of the gentleman fiom Missoun
I Mr NILES remarked that he agreed in many
things with his worthy fuend who had just taken
his seat, [Mr. Crittevden ] He thought this
| subject was not fitted for the consideration of Con-
gress, and he must be pel nutted to say that the
¡senate would be badly employed m discussing
whether this gentleman possessed the power of
creating ram, or of causing the rise and swell of
rivers If this gentleman could create ram, he
could aHo prevent it, and he might dry up the
Ohio nvei, and throw all the steamboats on the
sand If, however, this matter was to be referred,
he would piefei sending it to the Committee on
Finance It was somewhat similar to paper
money, a suit of sublimated bubble, and,-accord-
