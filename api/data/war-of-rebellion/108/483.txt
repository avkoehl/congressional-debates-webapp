HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA, Goldsborough, March 1, 1862.

Brigadier General L. O'B. BRANCH,Commanding Forces, &amp;c., New Berne, N. C.:

GENERAL: I have received your letter in regard to the batteries, &c.,; also Lieutenant-Colonel Crossan's letter. I hope you will push forward your defensive works with all possible vigor. I hope in a few days to have the services of Captain Meade, in whose ability as an engineer I have great confidence, and will take him down to New Berne, where a board of engineers can be assembled to examine and report upon the works. I have so little confidence in my own engineering that I would not like to advance an opinion when the services of a professional engineer can be obtained.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. GATLIN,

Brigadier-General.

[President JEFFERSON DAVIS:]

MY DEAR SIR: I was much gratified at receiving your letter of the 26th of February,* and am very glad to have your aide-de-camp, Colonel Lee, to converse with and communicate to you my views. I have been much weakened of late by the removal of all the officers of the Navy, who as the most experienced artillerists have had charge of the different batteries. I take the liberty of inclosing you copies of two letteres I wrote to the War Department on this subject, dated December 23, 1861,+
