HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Pikeville, August 24, 1863.

Colonel Minty,

Commanding Cavalry:

I have pretty reliable information from Harrison that two brigades passed up the Tennessee yesterday evening in great haste, for Blythe's Ferry and Hiwassee, and that all the crossings in the vicinity of Poe's farm and above had been considerably re-enforced. I trust by this time you have returned to your first position at the cross-roads, and that you will be able to watch the movements of the enemy from that point. I received a letter from General Crittenden's assistant adjutant-general yesterday morning, an extract from which I sent you yesterday, supposing you to be at Poe's. I inclose a copy, also an extract from another letter received this p. m. Can you get any provisions in your vicinity to eke out your rations? Shall send rations as soon as received.

Very truly, yours,

H. P. VAN CLEVE,

Brigadier-General.
