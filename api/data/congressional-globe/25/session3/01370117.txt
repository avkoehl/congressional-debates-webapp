Bouses of Congress or either of them , out that, by the Con
stitution, the p( ople of eaul States constituted one General
Government, for special purposes, and delegated to that
Government certain definite powers only reserving each
State to itself, the residuary mass of light to their own self
government, that, while the Constitution and laws of the
United States do attach to the whole people of the several
States immediately, in those matters, within the true juris
diction and confines of said Constitution, and m the mode
limited and defined thereby, vet, m all other matters the
said States retain each all its lights and power , under its
own sovereign and separate contiof, th u to this Constitu
tion each State acceded as a separate sovereign State, and
is an integral party and m its capacity of a sovereign State
is represented in Congress by us Senators, dutv appointed,
that, among the residuary light's, so by each State reserved,
is that of fully and freely expressing its opinions on all sub
jects delegated to the General Government, or touching the
infraction of the constitutional compact and of commuru
eating the said opinions to Congress , and that it is the con
stitutional duty of the Senate and of the House of Repre
■eentatives respectfully to receive, entertain, and consider,
and maturely «id deliberately to decide upon all &uch com
mumcations addressed to it by either of the States of this
Union, and the «ummaiy rejection of the same without their
being debated, printed, or icferred or anv action whatever
had thereon, would be insulting to the honor and injurious
to the rights and interests of the said sovereign States of the
iJmon
2   Resolved, That the Federal Government is a Go\ern
ment of limited and specific powers, derived from the peo-
ple of the States, thereby contedented and united, and to
said Government by them gianted under the Constitution ,
that all powers not delegated to the said United fetat s by
the Constitution, nor piolubited by it to the State , are re
seivcdtothe Statis ic&pectively, or to the people, that,
there fon , no right of any d nomination can be canceled,
abridged, restrained or modified, by the Congiess, by the
Senate or House of Representatives, acting in any capacity,
by the President or any Department or officer oí the United
States, except m the instances wherein power io given by
the Constitution for those purposes, and that, among other
imprescriptible and essential rights, the freedom of con
science, ot speech, of the press, ind the nghtof the people
peaceably to assemble and to petition the Government for
i lediess oí gtievances, are of the orig nal and innate un
mumty of the said people of the United State*—rights oí

fied, constitutionally, by any of the United folates wnat&o
ever, nor in any form ot lav\, whether the same be the act
ot the two Houses oí Congrc=s i r of either of them sepa
rately but the same were thu  guarmtied m order to oro
tect the citizen against the ihuse oí power, and not as the
means of trailing t it ri^ht of otheis , and that to permit
one or inoie State , or their citizens to convert them into
an mstiument not of protection, but of assault, against the
reserved rights or institutions and pe ice of the other States
or then citizens, or o the Term neo and of this District
and their citizens, would be a manifest violation of the con
stituttonal compact, a gross breach of the public futb, tend
mg to convert the brotherly love m which the Constitution
originated into hatred, and, it not effectually arrested, must
subvert the Union itself, and that this body owes a most
solemn oblig ition to itself, and the peoph of the States
which it represents, not to permit it&elf to be made an in
strument or party toan attempt¡*o flagitious and dangerous
3   Resohed, Ihatthe people of the United States did or
dam and establish the Constitution thereof, morder unong&t
other things     to íorm i more perfect union, totibhsh jus
tice, iiisme domistic tianquilhty, and to secure the bl ss>

there should be perfe* t e pi ill v and full   cope, a   far as i
consistent with the propei conducting the bu me<!s of the
House, on all subjects wuhin Us constitutional junsdic
tion , but to permit the members oí this House, under the
pretext of tieedom of debate to convert it into ilulltodis
cuss questions beyond its jurisdiction, and to denounce and
attack the domestic institutions of a portion of those fotates,
essentia! to their peace, secunty, and truiqmlhty  and the
property of their citi/ens existing before, and ex pre slv guar
antied by the Constitution itself, would be destructive ol all
harmony among the members ot the bodv   incompatible
with the discharge of its acknowledged duties -md destruc
tive of the great and avowed objects foi which the Con tí
tution, this Onion created, and this House instituted
4   Resolved therefore^ 1 hat the resolution of the House

the ninth section of the same article which provid-s that
no money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in eon°e

ical opinion, without pmisan violence or unbecoming
