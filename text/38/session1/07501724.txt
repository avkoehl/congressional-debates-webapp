minishing the-debt one dollar. Daring the war
the property or income tax yielded, per annum,
<£15,000,000, and was repealed with the return of
peace, when reliance was had altogether upon
indirect taxes until the reform under Sir Robert
Peel in 1842. A return to the property tax was
then made as less injurious to the industrial in-
terests of the nation than indirect taxes. We
have here three examples, that of revolutionary
France, ruined by^aper money, that of the great
success of the cash system by Napoleon, and that
of a! mixed system in England which gave tem-
porary success at the cost of future distress.'
OTJR REVOLUTIONARY EXAMPLE.
Having glanced at these modes of meeting great
national difficulties adopted abroad, we return to
our own great struggle when the thirteen colo-
nies banded together to repel a common aggress-
or. The expenses of the sev^n years'struggle
were never exactly ascertained, but were approx-
imated by Nourse, the Register of the Treasury
in 1790, at $135,193,103, of which one half was
raised by taxes levied and collected during the
war. The residue remained a debt due from the
States in their collective capacities after the war.
The payments from the Treasury were made in
Continental paper. The first issues were made
in 3776, and retained their value nearly through
the year 1777, but in 1780 ceased to be of any
value. The ratio of depieciation is seen in a table
prepared and presented to Congress by General
Washington in 1783 in settlement of his accounts.
At the close of 1777 the money was 75 cents per
dollar; at the close of 1778, 15 cents per dollar;
in 1779,3 cents per dollar; in 1780,cents. The
whole amount of the emissions was $357,47G,54l.
The ruin of this currency left the countiy in a
deplorable condition. The interest on the public
debt was not paid because the States would not
respond to the requisitions for that purpose, and
% public credit was gone. The debt sold for ton
cents on the dollar. The collection of private
debts was suspended, and piivate credit nearly
ceased to exist. With the peace a flood of goods
arrived to carry off the com, and taxes were not
to be collected. Many of the States had recouise
again to paper money and legal-tender laws, and
in Massachusetts open insurrection burst forth.
All these evils were cuied as if by magic when a
Government " based on the consent of the gov-
erned" was formed from a union of the States
that conferred on the Federal Government the
right to collect duties on imports for the purpose
of revenue, withheld from it the \ iglu again to issue
paper money, and prohibited the States from mak-
ing anything a legal lender hut gold and silver.
The customs at once gave the means of paying
the inteiest on the debt, icstored value to nil out-
standing obligations, removed the necessity for
taxes and State n quisitions, and put in motion
the wheels of commerce that soon supplied the
country with com.
THE PRESENT FISCAL. MANAGEMENT.
From that time to the advent of the present Ad-
ministration, the customs duties had supplied all
the wants of the Govei nment. The reports of the
Treasury Dcpaitmonl show the expenditures of
the Government from March 4, 1789, to July 1,
1861, to have been $1,453,790,786; received from
customs^!,575,152,579. In other words, the cus-
toms revenues had exceeded the whole expend-
itures of the Government by $121,361,793.
There has been received from lands $175,817,961,
and fiom other souices $95,305,322, making
$392,485,076, which sum has been applied to the
payment of the levolutionary debt, the expenses
of the war of 1812, the Florida war, the Mexican
war, including the purchase of California, the
Mormon war, the purchase of two empires—Lou-
isiana and Florida—and the indemnity to Texas,
besides building the national Capitol, the cus-
tom-houses, -Hght-houses, navy-yards, arsenals,
foundtries, &c., and filling them with millions of
dollais' worth of the materials of war. Such was
the operation of the customs duties down to the
induction of Mr. Chase into the Treasury De-
pal tment. The expenses of three years of ins
administiation may b«• stated thus: Air. Chase s
three years $2,385,283,655; twenty-four Secreta-
ries, seventy-two years, $1,453,790,786.
Thus, under Mr. Chase there has been ex-
pended nearly seventy percent, more than by his
twenty-four predecessors in the previous seventy-
two years, including the revolutionary debt and
pensions; and nearly the whole of this vast ex-
penditure of Mr. Chase exists in the shape of a
floating debt. It is really a floating debt, because ;
no system of finance whatever has been devised
to meet the interest or ultimately to liquidate it.
No attempt whatever has been made to place this
enormous debt on a solid basis. The utmost in-
genuity of the Secretary has been exhausted in
devising different forms of promises by which the
floating paper may be multiplied, but in no case
whatever has he projected a permanent system
of finance by which the fall of this swelling ava-
lanche may be averted. The utmost extent to
which he has gone in this direction is in his last re-
port, page 9," to urge on Congress efficient meas-
ures for increase of revenue," and on page 10 to
concur with some recommendations of the Com-
missioner of Internal Revenue for an increase of
tax on bank notes, spirits, tobacco, and cotton.
This is the whole. The Secretary is very fruit-
ful and profuse in suggestions as to putting out
paper, but has no fertility of invention when the
question is of payment. The honorable Secretary
also, on page 2 of his annual report, takes credit
to himselffor the gratifying fact that the receipts
from all sources, except internal revenue, exceed
the estimates. Now as the internal revenue was
estimated at one half the whole, and that was de-
ficient sixty per cent., it is difficult to see the
matter for congratulation. Let us look at the
figures as contained in the report, page 3:

Now, sir, tlie fust item line is customs, mid the
Secretary takes credit that it exceeded his esti-
mates $1,017,905 81. What is the fact? If we
turn to"|) ge 37 of tins same report, we find these
items:
Expenses of collecting customs $3,238,936 67
Repayment to importers, excess oi duties... 2,262,770 69
Debentures on drawbacks  1,026,135 58
Total  ®B,527,849 94
This sum being deducted fiom the total of
duties the Treusuty will have realized actually
$61,(;il9,i292, orftG,342,444 less than the estimates.
Hut the pretense may be set up that the estimate
was sross revenue. Such a pretense is not valid,
because any amount may be taken and repayment
made. Moreover, the expenses and repayments
this year exceeded those of the last $1,795,461,
which more than absorbs the, increase in revenue
for which the Secretary takes credit. The next
item is land revenues, total amount $167,617,
for winch the Secretary takes great credit. Sir,
he charg< s for collecting that amount, on page 37,
$111,254 06; for surveys of the land, $114,298 81;
for special counsel fees, $24,203 90; tor repay-
ments of land sold, §12,947 38; for indemnity for
swamp lands sold to individuals, §37,189 78; mak-
ing a total of $299,893 99 spent to obtain $166,617.
Certainly nota veiy profitable operation. Weare
then told that the direct tax fell short $10,135,614,
or ninety per cent.; that the internal revenue fell
short $47,815,510, neaily sixty percent. Weare
then carefully told—page 3—that this careless es-
timate was by "a very competent gentleman,"
which means clearly not by the Secretary him-
self. The result is, that instead of $180,000,000,
the Secretary realized but $116,783,069. Every
item in the Secretary's estimates fell largely short.
It will be observed that the Secretary includes m
his " leceipts" $13,043,546 81 balance from last
year. That was undoubtedly a sum of money
to be used, but was not a " receipt" of the cur-
rent year; notwithstanding winch, we have the
following on page 4:
" Fiom the actinl expenditure, §714,709,971, there must
he deducted the actual receipts, $134,443,313, in order to
t>how the amount derived nom loans, §o90,26G,632."
Now, this sum of $124,443,313 includes the
$13,043,546 81 on hand at the beginning of the
year, and of which there remained on hand at the
close §5,327,044. This last sum is wholly ignored
by the Secretary, and his calculation is wrong by
that amount, a sum equal to the whole expendi-
ture of Washington's Administration. It would
be tedious to pursue these errors through tlje
whole report. Enough has been said to show the
slip-shod manner in which the mere details of tho
national finances have been treated.
The great question of taxation has been stu-
diously evaded. The most sanguine estimates
have been made to keep up a promise of revenue,
while the substance has been avoided. Expe-
rience has shown that the estimates ofthe Depart-
ment are entirely unreliable, and on page 10 the
Secretary states it was not his policy to tax:
" [t was not important, so Jong as it seemed highly proI>-
able that the war would speedily lie brought to a successful
close, that the revenue should exceed the ordinary ex-
penses and interest. On the contrary, it seemed wisest to
obtain the means for nearly the wllofe ol the extraoidniary
expenditures by loan, and tlius avoid me necessity of any
considerable mcieaseof the buidens of the people ata lime
when the sudden outbreak of flagitious rebellion had de-
ranged their business and teinpoianly diminished tlieir in-
comes." *«***• * * *
" But receipts disappointed expectation, and it soon be-
came obvious that a much iaiger propoition of the means
needed for the fiscal year 1862 than the principle adopted
would allow must be derived from loans."
Thus the plan was to emit paper at a time
when tho enthusiasm of the people was fully
aroused, whon their wealth was untouched, and
when their ability and will to pay taxes weie al-
most boundless. Congress had, however, passed
a tax of $20;0,00,000 on real estate, but having
enacted the internal revenue act concocted by the
honorable Secretary's "very competent gentle-
man." He informs us, page 11:
" 111 that icpmt, (Dccembei, 1862,) therefore, and in Ills
subsequent coinmnnications to pioper committees, the
Secretary su«ycsted no taxation, but confined his recom-
mendations to'other measures for the improvement of the
public credit, among which those relating to loans and to
the uinfoimity ot currency held the toremost place."
The meaning of which is that the Secretary
having embarked in the phper-inoney system was
determined to follow it out; accoidmgly the real
estate tax was repealed, and the internal revenue
tax so modified as to be profitless. The customs
that had been in the ouginal loan bill of July,
1861, pledged to the payment of the loan then
authorized, and which pledge had been stricken
out in the Senate, were again appropriated, first,
to the payment of the interest on the pubhedebt,
and, second, to a sinking fund of one per cent,
per annum on the entire debt. This sinking
fund has virtually been repealed in order to sell
the gold m aid of speculators for a fall, which
has, however, produced a counter eifect; and
theie will remain only the customs taxes, receiv-
able m gold, appropriated to the payment of the
interest on the public debt. This debt now out-
standing iu various foims of paper is of three
classes: first, that of which the interest is pay-
ablem coin; second, that ot which the interest is
payable in paper; and third, that which bears no
interest. The amounts under these heads were
as follows, February 1, by an official report which
has been published:
First class, interest in com §76:1.379,214
Second class, interest ill paper 
Third class,no inteiest

There is, 111 addition to this, $350,000,000 of
interest-brai ing e.ui rency being i&sued, and, as we
have seen from theestmiates of the Secretary, the
expenditures are $3,000,000 per day. The debt
at the end of the cui rent yeat, in any event, will
beat least §2,500,000,000. If that debt is ever
paid at all it must be by funding the whole of it
m a stock, the interest payable m gold, m which
case the annual interest will be $350,u00,000.
The old peace expenditures of the Government
were $83,000,000 with tin Army of twelve thou-
sand men and an insignificant Navy. The whole
expendituies wiii never again be under $200,000,-
000, and with tho interest on the debt, §450,000,-
000, to which add one percent, for a sinking fund,
and the amount is §475,000,000. In the last ten
years the average of customs duties has not been
over $50,000,000 per annum. There remains,
then, $425,000,000 per annum, which is to be ex-
tracted enliiely by taxes from a war-exhausted
people. This immense amount is to be paid in
specie at the rate of two dollars for one received
by the Government. Up to this moment there
