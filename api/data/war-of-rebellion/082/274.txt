CHERRYSTONE, VA., July 15, 1864.

General WEITZEL,

Acting Chief of Staff:

Your telegram received. We think a regiment would be too large, whereas one company would be sufficient, which we suggest.

Respectfully,

FORT POWHATAN, July 15, 1864.

Mr. O'BRIEN:

The lieutenant commanding guard states that there were 250 cavalry, commanded by Colonel White, of Thirteenth Virginia, passed through Cabin Point just before him yesterday morning, and a portion of their cavalry, cannot find how many, came back to Cabin Point yesterday p.m. and stayed over night near there. There was some infantry, but reports vary so much that I can get nothing reliable concerning them. Lieutenant is of the opinion that there is a force lying to trap us.
