HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,July 17, 1864-8 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

General Hooker has his troops posted on the intermediate road between Pace's and Powers' Ferry roads. General Palmer has Johnson on the Pace's Ferry road, and Davis on a road between that and the railroad bridge. All the troops occupy the ridge overlooking Nancy's Creek, with their skirmishers bordering the creek. Baird is in reserve behind Davis. A rebel battery with its infantry support, which has been firing on McCook's battery, posted in the redoubt to the left of the railroad, cleared out from its position in Peach Tree Creek this p. m. and retired across the creek in direction of Atlanta. Sutermeister has made excellent practice to-day, and will continue to fire at intervals through the night. I shall move my headquarters to-morrow to near Hooker, who will be in the center of my army.

Major-General.
