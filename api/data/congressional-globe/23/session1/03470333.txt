PETITIONS.
Mr WEBSTER said, tnat before he left his
seat some days since, he 1 ad presented a memo-
rial from the city of Albany, New York, and was
authouz d to say, and did say, thut it contained
about two thousmd eight hurdred signatuies of
qual fled voters, exercising the rightof st ffiage m
thatcity. He saw afterwards in the public punts
a contradic'ion of this, statemei t, ind one of the
Senators from New York [Mr Wfight] had
ta'.en notice of a deficiency in the number of sig-
natures The notice that that Senator had taken
of it had attracted the attention of the memorial
ists, and it was then ascertained that one of the
rolls of names attached to the memorial had been
accidentally omitted by the individuals chaiged
with its transmission to the seat of Government,
but it had been found, and now here it is, (said
Mr W ,) with affidavits made in due form of law,
and here are l,4d5 names, making up tne defi-
ciency, and if they are not sufficient, but little
\ ould be hazarded in declaring thet four or five
hundied moie might Le obtained in Albany Sir,
in one of Mr B irke's glowirg speeches, (said
Ml W ,) he remarked, that no regard should
be paid to the number of the inhabitants of the
United States from the census which might be ,
taken, because, befoie it could be completed, the 1
rumbers would be beyond it So, sit, with le

SPECIAL ORDER.
After t! e morn rg business had been finished,
the Senate resumed tnetonside ationuf Mr Foii-
syrn's motion to amend M Po ndexter's reso-
lutions, assigning tne icasons why the President's
protest «hou!d not be i ecened by reciting the pro
test itself in the first reso'ution
I Mr CALHOUN having withdrawn his appeal
fiom the decision of the Chair—
Mr POIN DEXTER submitted a genera! prop
osition in writing, as a pomt of order, des'gnedto
| reach this panícula" case
lie CHAIR  (vlr   Kin", of Alabama, pre
, siding) said, tl atwhi her he decided foroi against
thepioposi'io'i, tv ould not affect Mi  Forsyth's
right to propose an amendment to either of the
rese'ations
Mr POSIs DEXTER siid he designed hisieso-
lutions as one entire motion 1 he three fir&t res-
olut ons weie the has s of the fourth, and thcy
stated the reasors for com ng to the fourth, they
all wert to but one point, wl u.h was, that the
paper be not received Ft! e pi mciple were estab-
lished, whic i would be the consequence of receiv-
ing the motion, it woJd enable any member to
offer any paper oi memorial, however offensive in
its terms, and ti us, by saying " in the woids fol
lowing," (then inserting the paper,) impair the
dignity of the Senate All amendments, whether
passed or rejected,should leave the original prop-
osition where it s ood before they were offered
Mr CLAY sa d the gentleman fiom Georgia
offered the orumal paper itself as a part of his
proposition, andj.hen the question arose whether
be could so ut>e it, which, being decided in the
affirmative, the gentleman from South Carolina
appealed fiom the decision of the Chair That
appeal he had since withdrawn, in order that the
preliminary question, whether the amendment of
the gentleman from Georgia was in order, might
come up
Mr WEBSTER was afraid there might be
some misapprehension on the subject, which he
was desnous should be avoided There were
two objections now made the first was, that the
motion of the gentleman from Georgia was notm
writing The othei was, that a proposition being
made to exclude the Piesident's message, this
motion was made ~with a design to avoid that
exc'us on He was anxious to get at the mam
quest on of order, whether the motion itself thus
to amend, wis n o>-dei
Mr CHAMBERS thought the true question
was, whethei a proposition could be made which
would defeat the original pronosition If this
could obtain, forty seven Se lators might gravely
de erm re that a paper shou'd not be placed on the
Journal, and the \erv proceeding in which this
conclusion was endeavoied to be armed at, indi-
cated that it was attained,in defianceof their will,
by the instrumentality of tne other forty eighth
Senatoi alone It cou d not be, such a papei,
fiom tne veiy nature of the business in which the
derate was engaged, must be excluded
Mr PO i NDEXTER then w ithdi ew his written
proposition
Mr WRIGHT said he felt himself quite un
skilled in point* of order, but the question seemed
to him a plain one When the communication
came from the President, we had the motion which
was now embraced in four separate forms, that the
paper be not received These resolutions were an
expression upon the character and contents of the
paper itself, and upon the sentiments and princi-
ples contained m it, and should we be required to
record our votes, without recording our reasons
also far those votes' How could any man here-
after determine the conectness of our judgment
upin the paper, without having the paper itself?
\Vhy should we go on and n ake an expiession of
our sen'iments,and then say that the paper should
not come before us? It must either be considered
or not, and was it not proper, and also the right
of any Senator to have the paper spread on the
Journal along with the judgment, as evidence of
the conclusion which was come to? Oughtnotthe
Journal to cairy along with it the evidence of the
vote of every Seratoi '
Mi   CLAY replied that the President had sent
this paper 1 ere, for the sole purpose of having it
i recorded on oui Journals    It was not designed for
any legislative or ultimate action, and therefore
the only question was, whether itcould be received
or not     An amendment was then offered, which
' went to incorporate m itself every word of the
I document, and thus to effect the very object which
the President wished, which the Senate was delib-
erating on, and  which  they might  not decide
I according to his wishes    Then the question was,
I whether the motion was, or was not, in order; and
common sense decided that it was not.   It was
i possible to vote knowingly as to its contents, with-
out its being on the Journals     How many bills
1 were put on the Journals m hoc net 6a ' None. He
denied that it was necessary to go on the Journal,
in order to  consider  and vote upon it     It was
already, to a ceitain extent, in the possession of
the Senate, and the resolutions ought to be passed,
in order to let the President know why, m view of
our constitutioral lights and privileges, we would
not receive it    He was in favor of treating the
piner with the utmost respect, and would, at any
time, receive from the President any paper which
he was ready to send for uU.mate action by the
Senate    Bu< he declined receiving any protest
upon any question, which led to no practical
results
Mr FORSYTH said, if heunderstood the point
of the objection, it was, that the effect of his mo-
tion would beto place the messages on the journal,
and honorable gentlemen said that it was out of
order, because it would defeat the object of the
Senate    How could the Senate decide the ques-
tion of order till they had decided the question
1 which was now raised >   The motion conid not go
I on the journals til! the ayes and noeswere ordered
Honorable gentlemen were in favor of using- the
rules of   order for common sense purposes, but
then mode of using them was by the majority to
j defeat the rights of a minority.   Here the Senate
' had received a message from  the President—it
I had been read,and had been thesubjectof a three
| days' discussion,and propositions had been made
' as to the character of the paper, and yet honorable
I gentlemen had not n-evoed ti    We had got it, and
' how could we nrtget it    Mr F did not know how
you could make the President receive it, if it were
I your good pleasure to send it back to him again,
and he should deny it    The paper was here, and
it must be consideied     Each resolution founded
upon it was distinct in itself,ard you could make
a proposition to alter, amend, or negative eitner
or all of them, and the Senate might still do what
they chose with the message, if his amendment
went on the Journal     Gen'lemen professed great
respect foi the President     He must be answered,
but the message must not be spread on the Jour-
nal     We had been told tnat nothing was so bane-
I ful in the ej es of power as simple truth, and Mr
F thought the maxim applied ns well to legisla-
tive majorities as  to  executive power     Mr   F
said his object was to mcorpoiate the paper with
the resolutions, in order that its character m ght
be  seen  with reference to the resolutions     He
contended that the motion was perfectly in order
until ore fifth of the Senators present had decided
that the yeas and nays should be taken.   As an
objection had been made to his offer of theon-
ginal paper as his amendment, he now withdrew
I that, and sent to the Chair a copy of that paper,
and asked the yeas and nays on the question oí
order
