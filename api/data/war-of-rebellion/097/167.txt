WASHINGTON, D. C., March 25, 1865-3.30 p. m.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Winchester, Va.:

General Grant suggests that all troops in the Department of West Virginia be organized as the Eighth Army Corps. Of course your veteran regiments of the First Corps are to be excepted. He also wants all troops not required for holding Baltimore and Ohio Railroad organized into brigades and divisions and prepared for the field. Have you any suggestions to make before the order is issued?

HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,March 25, 1865.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

I do not understand what relation the commander of the department would bear to that of the corps. I presume the matter has been considered.

If so, the corps must have a great many divisions and very moderate division commanders in point of capacity.

For instance, the number of troops required to defend the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad depends upon whether a force moves down the Valley or the front is uncovered by the troops being withdrawn. This also affects the question of place and manner of preparing the brigades and divisions for field service. I sent to the Secretary of War this morning be special messenger, at this request, a statement of the troops in the division, and how located. This may be useful in preparing the details of the order.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I would like to know if there is any longer any objection to my throwing Winchester out of my lines and bringing my troops together where I can see to their organization and equipment? As they are
