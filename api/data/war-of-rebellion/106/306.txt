SIR: In reference to so much of your lette of the 16the ultimo as refers to the establishment of a military post near Klamath Lake, I desire to remind your that the Klamath Lak, Rouge River, and Umpqua Valleys are not in my district. General Orders, Numbers 10, of the 22nd of November, 1860, from the Headquarters of the Army, give the District of Oregon the same limits as those of the former Department of Oregon. The latter are establihment per War Department General Orders, Numbers 10, of the 13th of September, 1858. I apprehend that it will be very difficult to raise even half the six additional companies of First Oregon Cavalry. Thus I will have no troops to spare for Klamath Lake. They should come from California. I shall, as soon as practicable, make the report you require on the subject of the necessity of a post there, having written letters to person acquainted with that region who will give me the information.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. ALVORD,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.
