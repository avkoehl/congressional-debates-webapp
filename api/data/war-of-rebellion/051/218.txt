which had become broken in the pursuit, before advancing farther. This had just been finished when Lieutenant-General Hill rode up, and observing that we had done well, directed that I should throw forward skirmishers for the distance of a mile. a few moments afterward I was ordered by Major-General Breckinridge to bivouac near the main Chattanooga road, and I accordingly moved back to this position.

Many prisoners remained within our lines during the charge, but no attention was paid to them. They numbered, probably, 300 or 400.

The position stormed was held by a brigade of United States regulars under Brigadier-General King. The enemy's dead and wounded marked the track of the brigade. Many hundreds of small-arms were found upon the field next morning. A battery was taken by the Thirteenth and Twentieth Louisiana, but the gallant manner in which the remainder of the brigade behaved entitles them to share in the credit of the capture.

During the night our skirmishers, under Captain E. M. Dubroca, Company B, Thirteenth and Twentieth Louisiana, sent in 30 prisoners, among them several officers, and Major J. E. Austin's battalion brought in 50 more the next day.

The brigade halted victorious at night on the very ground whence it had recoiled at midday.

I would respectfully refer the major-general commanding to the reports of subordinate commanders for the parts their commands bore in the battle.

Among the officers Colonel Daniel Gober, Sixteenth and Twenty-fifth Louisiana, and Colonel Leon von Zinken, Thirteenth and Twentieth Louisiana, were conspicuous for courage and skill. All the officers and men behaved with commendable gallantry. Major C. H. Moore, Sixteenth and Twenty-fifth Louisiana; Major J. C. Kimbell, Thirty-second Alabama; Captain H. A. Kennedy, Nineteenth Louisiana, who commanded in the evening charge, and Captain E. M. Dubroca, Thirteenth and Twentieth Louisiana, showed themselves officers well fitted to handle troops on the field.

The report of Captain C. H. Slocomb, Washington Artillery, shows how large a share his command bore in the engagement. I cannot speak in terms too high of the former is only equaled by the bravery of the latter.

Our valor-inspiring chief of artillery, Major Graves, of Major-General Breckinridge's staff, fell mortally wounded in the arms of Captain C. H. Slocomb. He fell where his heroic soul desired-on the battle-field, among those who loved him, and in the arms of a brave comrade.

But our success was not without heavy loss. Our chivalrous commander, Brigadier General D. W. Adams, was wounded in the charge of the morning, and fell into the hands of the enemy. Lieutenant Colonel R. W. Turner, Nineteenth Louisiana, was wounded, and the brave Major Loudon Butler, of the same regiment, breathed his last at the head of his regiment.

Of General Adams' staff, I am indebted for valuable services to Captain John W. Labouisse, assistant inspector-general, who was ever prompt and efficient, and to Lieutenants E. M. Scott and G. S. Yerger likewise for zeal and bravery. Nor should I omit to pay a special tribute to the soldierly bearing of Lieutenant T. L. Ware. He
