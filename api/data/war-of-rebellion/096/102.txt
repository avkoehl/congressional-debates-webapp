CLARKSBURG, W. VA., January 11, 1865-2 p.m.

Bvt. Major General B. F. KELLEY,

Cumberland:

Two men of the Eighth Ohio Cavalry have reached Buckhannon. They report Beverly surprised at about 3 o'clock this morning. Rebels had surrounded the quarters when they left. They fell confident of the capture of Beverly. They saw great quantity of smoke when seven miles from Beverly on the mountains, and suppose the place burned.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel, Commanding Forces.

CLARKSBURG, W. VA., January 11, 1865.

Bvt. Major General B. F. KELLEY,

Cumberland:

Stragglers are coming into Buckhannon. One of them reports the rebels moving on Philippi. Is it not probable that this rebel force is the same reported at Petersburg December 20 as moving toward West Union? Am of opinion that re-enforcements should be sent to Grafton and Clarksburg. General Lightburn is here, and concurs in this opinion.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel, Commanding.

CLARKSBURG, W. VA., January 11, 1865.

Bvt. Major General B. F. KELLEY,

Cumberland, Md.:

The men who reached Buckhannon from Beverly say the rebel force was infantry, and held the breast-works adn Philippi road, leaving the only way of escape toward Buckhannon. I am of opinion the force is cavalry, dismounted out of town. Had advised my outposts and road troops before receiving your order to do so.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
