Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I sent a scout out on the Alabama road to-day, one mile beyond Coosaville. They returned by way of river road. They saw nothing, neither could they hear of any force in that direction. I will picket the roads out three miles to night and in the morning send a scout up the Summerville road to look after the 300 men that White reports in that vicinity.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. L. GODFREY,

Lieutenant-Colonel First Alabama Cavalry.
