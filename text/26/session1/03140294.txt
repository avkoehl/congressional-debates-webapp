heretofore offered by Mr R   Garland to print the testimony
received since the leport of the said committee was made
, Mr PRENTISS rose and asked leave of the House to make
a remark or two applicable to the allegation against him, made
by the gentleman from New York fMr Morgan] in his speech
of yesterday, when in Committee of the Whole on the Treasury
Note bill   No objection being made, Mr P went on to say that
he had learned this morning, from verbal sources, that his col.
league, in speaking of him, had stated that he (Mr. P ) was the
editor of a Federal newspaper v. hich opposed the last war, and J
with olheia of his political associates, he had rejoiced at the vic-
tories of the enemy over the American arms It was true, Mr
P said, that he was a Federalist at the period referred to, and
that he edited a paper which sustained Federal doctrines. The
reason was that he was born and bred in Massachusetts, the hot
bed ol Federalism, and that it took lime and lefleeliontoeradi
cate early imp-essions. He did oppose the declaiation of wai, as
having been made prematurely and without adequate prepara
tion for a contest with such a powerful nation as England, but
he utterly denied that he ever o posed the war after (he con
fltct began So much in regard to the imputation of being a
Federalist, and opposing the war in the columns of his paper
Now, in regard to the alteration of having "rejoiced at the vie
tones of the enemy over the American arms" During the
canvass for a seat on this floor, in the year 1836, the Whig pa
per in his (Mr P's) district, did make a charge of the same cha-
racter as that reiterated by his colleague, and it was promptly
refuted and falsified hy the signatures of foerteen of
he most respectable citizens of the place where he (Mr P )
resides, who were residents during the whole of the war, and
three of them [Messrs. Groves, Nicholls, and Russell]
members of the Whig Central Corresponding Committee of the
county, the latter of whom was a member of the late Harris
burg Convention, which nominated General Harrison for Pre-
sident The charge is in all respects untrue, and he (Mr P )
had the record at home to prove it to be so One win d more,
and Mr. P had done. He confessed his Federal prepossessions,
until the year 1821, when light beamed upon his mind, and he
had since given his best services to the Democratic interest, as a
matter of principle The i olitical sin was repented of, and
theintelhsent electors of Democratic Otsego had pronounced
their forgiveness, by twice deputing him to lepresenting them
on this floor
Mr MEDILL, who was entitled to the floor, made an able
vindication of the majority of the Committee of Elections,
from the charges which had been made against it by Messrs
Botts and Fimiore, in iheir speeches, and in their minority
report His speech will be published hereafter. He had not
concluded at the expiration of the morning hour, at which
