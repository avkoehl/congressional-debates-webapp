FRED T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,September 29, 1864-1.45 p. m.

Brigadier General CHARLES GRIFFIN,

Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: The probabilities are that we may have to move very soon. You will withdraw all your pickets east of the railroad and direct them to join their commands. Our operations on the north side of the James River are succeeding, and the enemy is moving troops from Petersburg to Richmond.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRED T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,September 29, 1864-2.45 p. m.

Brigadier General CHARLES GRIFFIN,

Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: Brigadier-General Baxter's brigade is to be detached to make a reconnaissance out toward Poplar Spring Church. Inform your brigade commander nearest the fort on the left of this movement, so that he can be prepared to defend the fort, if necessary, but which is not at all probable. No one need be put into the fort until needed.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS,September 29, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel F. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifth Army Corps:

COLONEL: General Orders, Numbers 43, have been received. Paragraph 2 is so indefinite that I cannot understand to what extent I am to withdraw my pickets, for I do not know where Poplar Spring Church is. General Ayres connects with the right of my line, which rests at the Flowers house and extends one mile and a half to the left to the railroad on the line designated by General Warren. What portion of this line do I relieve?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. GRIFFIN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
