Colonel S. B. M. YOUNG, Lynchburg:

Assure all freedmen that they cannot be supported by the Government, but must work for their living. Where they cannot find labor, put them on abandoned lands and assign them plots for cultivation and seed and animals to put in crops. The Quartermaster's Department has been directed to issue 1,500 animals for that purpose. Make requisition on General Ord for a share. Rations must be issued sparingly and only where necessary to prevent suffering. You may use any of the colored people whom you are obliged to retain in repairing the canal, keeping an account of expenses. You will make your returns and reports direct to General Ord, commanding department.
