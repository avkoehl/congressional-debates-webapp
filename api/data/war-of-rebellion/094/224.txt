DECEMBER 16, 1864.

General WILSON:

Major Holahan has been obliged to fall back from the Granny White pike. He reports heavy masses of infantry are constantly moving to our left, and have been for nearly an hour. We have ten prisoners--eight from Cheatham's division--all of whom came over from their right last night and this morning; two, also, of General Stewart's escort. Stewart's headquarters on Granny White pike, a mile and a half from here.

Respectfully,

J. H. HAMMOND,

Brigadier-General.

(Copies forwarded by General Wilson to Generals Whipple and Schofield.)

BRICK CHURCH, ON THE HARDIN PIKE, December 16, 1864. (Received 10.25 a. m.)

Colonel ISRAEL GARRARD,

Commanding Seventh Ohio Volunteer Cavalry:

COLONEL: I occupy the Hardin pike at this point, and find that the enemy have taken the Franklin road, which branches out at the Hardin pike at this point. General Chalmers passed here at 8 o'clock this morning. Found one abandoned wagon here.

Yours, obediently,

R. C. RANKIN,

Captain, Commanding Detachment.

STEVENSON, December 16, 1864.

General MEAGHER:

Telegram from Decherd just received gives the following:

Commanding officer at Duck River reports heaviest cannonading of the campaign now being heard in direction northwestward from there.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

STEVENSON, December 16, 1864.

Brigadier-General MEAGHER:

The report of Breckinridge's moving from Manchester to this place has reached us. The artillery firing was heard here, at Larkinsville, and was reported at Duck River as coming from the northwest. Officer at Decherd reports all quiet in that neighborhood. The firing therefore heard by your party must have been that from the vicinity of Nashville or Franklin.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.
