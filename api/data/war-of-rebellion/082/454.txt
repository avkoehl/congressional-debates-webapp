HEADQUARTERS, Deep Bottom, July 1864-6.45 p.m.

Major General D. B. BIRNEY:

I still hold the crest and picket-line on the New Market and Malvern Hill road. The officers of the picket report an appearance of activity, slashing,&amp;c., in the enemy's lines not noticed before. The two prisoners I have sent to corps headquarters are from a regiment not before heard of on my front.

Yours, respectfully,R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.

Lieutenant Colonel E. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have just captured an orderly from Captain Cochran, Seventeenth Mississippi, who confirms the report that Kershaw's division is on my front. He also reports two Mississippi regiments advancing in skirmish line toward my picket on the lower side of Four-Mile Creek, whether for the purpose of attacking in force in the morning or to establish a picket-line, I cannot say. I am inclined to think the latter. I have strengthened my line, and am going to send one of my veteran regiments over to-night?

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.

A Richmond paper of to-day, which I have just forwarded to corps headquarters, contains a dispatch from General Hood saying that he attacked Sherman on the 22d, capturing 22 pieces of artillery, 5 stand colors, and 2,000 prisoners. General McPherson is reported killed. They acknowledge loss of General Walker killed, and Smith, Gist, and Mercer wounded.

Respectfully,
