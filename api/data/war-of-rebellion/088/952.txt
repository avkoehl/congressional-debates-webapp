Major-General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: A deserter from the Thirty-fourth North Carolina, Scales' brigade, of Wilcox's division, has just been forwarded. He came in last evening; states that his brigade (Scales') lies across the Weldon railroad near the lead-works, with McGowan's and Lane's brigades to the right, which is all of Wilcox's division south of the Appomattox. Heth's division is on the extreme right of the line fortifying on the Boydton plank road. Mahone's division is to the left of Scales' brigade, and informant thinks it extends to Beauregard's line. Wright's brigade is on the right of Mahone's division, and joins Scales' brigade; thinks Hoke's division is in reserve somewhere in rear of the line; cannot locate it. Three of our deserters came into the lines of McGowan's brigade on Sunday last; said they had been in the army only two days; had not heard from the Valley when informant left. The last news from Early was that he had driven Sheridan down the Valley. A deserter from the Third Georgia received last evening corroborates this statement in regard to the position of Mahone's and Wilcox's divisions.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. C. BABCOCK.
