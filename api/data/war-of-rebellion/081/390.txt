Major-General WRIGHT.

Commanding Sixth Corps:

General Birney reports that he has advanced his picket-line, but that you inform him that you are ordered not to advance yours. The commanding general directs that yours be advanced correspondingly, and I have so informed General Birney. General Birney has advanced his pickets in consequence of the orders of 10.30 a.m. of to-day to him, and those to you, with which he was made acquainted by me.

Yours of 5 p.m., is received. I was instructed by General Meade to hold my picket-line where it had then advanced-that is, the position of yesterday;but under your order I shall again advance them though they are already one mile and a half in advance of my line and on the left still more. Please say how far they shall go.

HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS.

June 24, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Since sending you Colonel Bryan's dispatch,* I have seen him and learn that the force he sent down the old Norfolk road crossed the Blackwater,reaching a cross-road leading into the Jerusalem road. The knowledge of this road may be important. The cavalry would have followed this road, returning by the Jerusalem road, but for fear of being fired upon by our own forces.

H. G. WRIGHT.

Major-General.
