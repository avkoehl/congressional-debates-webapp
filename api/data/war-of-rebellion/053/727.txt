RICHMOND, October 4, 1863.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Comdg. Army of Tennessee, near Chattanooga:

GENERAL: Lieutenant-General Pemberton being without a command at this time, and being desirous for active service with you, has been directed to report at your headquarters, and to confer with you as to the possibility of being assigned to a corps in your army, and whether or not such assignment would conduce to the public interest.

You are aware of the prejudice which has been arrayed against him, and will know whether it exists among your troops to such an extent as to destroy his usefulness. If it be so, he would not desire to be put on duty there.

I will only add that he possesses the confidence of the Executive as well as my own, and is believed to have been unjustly assailed.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
