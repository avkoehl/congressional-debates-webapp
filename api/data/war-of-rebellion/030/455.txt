HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY,La Vergne, Tenn., December 19, 1862.

Captain D. G. REED, Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to state that, agreeably to instructions, Ii, on the 18th and 19th instant, visited and inspected the line of pickets extending from the Murfreesborough and Nashville pike to the Franklin pike. The chain from the former to the Nolensville pike is well posted, both as to position and continuity, and the vedettes understand and perform their duties well. From the Nolensville pike to Franklin the roads alone are picketed, and the line is kept up by patrols; the length of the line and the small force rendering it impossible to make one continuous line. Around Franklin the pickets are well posted, and, in my opinion, it would be almost impossible for the enemy to advance upon the main guard without timely notice from the outpost.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. E. HILL,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.
