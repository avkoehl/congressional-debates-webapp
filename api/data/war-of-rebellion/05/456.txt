formerly of that Army, have more recently been in the habit of watching the Potomac between Great Falls and Seneca and firing on our pickets. They are reported to me by my guide to have shot two stragglers of General Banks' division, and left them for the hogs to devour. On arriving on the ground some time after Meade, I found that he had captured the Colmans and 3 sons of Poole, rank secessionists, and after making the necessary dispositions to resist an attack, commenced loading the train, which work was soon completed, and the command returned, arriving here at 6 p.m.

Nothing of the enemy was seen or heard by the scouts sent out in advance and on the flanks.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. A. McCALL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

Brigadier General R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.

P. S.-It is with pleasure that I refer to the very exemplary conduct of all the troops on this occasion, and can commend from personal observation the good discipline maintained. There was no straggling or lagging behind during the march out or returning.
