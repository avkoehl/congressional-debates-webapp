WARRENTON JUNCTION, MAY 1, 1864. (Received 5.45. p. m.)

General BENHAM,

Commanding Engineers:

Please have pontoon train sent down by railroad at once, sufficient to span Rappahannock. I think it takes ten boats. It should be at Rappahanock Station, with the working party necessary to build it, on the morning of the 3rd, without fail. Have officer in charge train report to me at this place on his way down.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

ENGINEER BRIGADE,

Washington, D. C., May 1, 1864-7.30 p. m.

(Received 7.55 p. m.)

General A. E. BURNSIDE,

Warenton Junction:

Your dispatch of to-day just received. Please inform me if you require pontoon trucks with the bridge; otherwise I shall suppose you require only the boats and superstructure on the brigade to be used at Rappahannock Station. If you need trucks and animals from Washington, it may be impossible to get them to you by Tuesday morning. The brigade and trucks only can reach you in due time, if the railroad can take them, which will be seen at once.

H. W. BENHAM.

WARRENTON JUNCTION, May 1, 1864.

Brigadier-General BENHAM:

I do not want the trucks. I simply want the boats, superstructure and building party.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

Practice your new troops at target, and drill them as much a possible. Be ready to move of five hours' notice.

MANASSAS, May 1, 1864.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

No troops have passed this place this morning of foot; some have on cars. We are constantly drilling. Please send me at one brigade commander. Will inform you when troops pass here.

E. FERRERO,

Brigadier-General.
