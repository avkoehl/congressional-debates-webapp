HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON, 22ND ARMY CORPS,Washington, D. C., December 10, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Commanding Middle Military Division:

I have seen the refugees. There is no real foundation for the rumor of the two brigades of infantry. A deserter from Lee's cavalry in the Valley says that Lomax's division of cavalry was in the vicinity of Little Washington, gathering tithes of the corps. No considerable force was found this side.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.

Major-General AUGUR:

A squadron of the Eighth Illinois Cavalry has just returned on a scout from near Gainesville, and has seen nothing of the enemy but a few guerrilla scouts, usually found through this part of the country at all times.
