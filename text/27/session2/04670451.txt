to know that there were abuses prevailing m this branch of
expenditure, arising from the mode in which the accounts are
audited    The Secretary of the Treasury, as they had been in
fprnxed by the Senator, was not the person from whom the
estimates came, they came from the marshals of the different
districts—the very men who were to receive the money    And
iiow weret&eaccountssettled?   Not by the Treasury Depart
m&ftt^ not by any person who was responsible for the proper per
formance of the duty,   but  by the judges, who hoid their
offices during  good behavioi,   and who   wert,   not   in any
Way responsible     A circumstance had come to his know
ledge* which he would mention    The Auditor of the Trea
eüry   having  charge  of matters   of   this  kind,  had   over
and over again resisted the allowance of extravagant sums
which had been made to the marshals, and district attorneys
And what was the consequence?   The marshal, having the mo
ney in his own hands, paid himself   And though the United
States might bring its action to recover back the money, that
action must be tued befoie the judge, who certified the amount,
and in every cas>e the United States had been, and would be, obli
ged to allow the money to be retained   This was 'he state of the
Case The Auditor oí the Treasury,whose duty it properly was to
audit and examine these accounts, had been obliged to yield,
and to pass these accounts, though he did not believe they wtre
sanctioned by law    He (Mr Buchanan) was inclined there
fore, to believe that the provision now under consideration, di
recung the accounts to be referred to the head of the Treasury
Department,   instead of the judges,  was a veiy  good one
He (Mr Buchanan) entertained a high respect for the judges
oí the Supreme Court, but they weie not the proper officers lor
the auditing of these accounts    1 hey were necessarily under
the influence of kindly feelings, and it would be an extremely
unpleasant duty fojj the judge to reject an account claimed by
his clerk or the marshal of hi© district   He would be extremely
unwilling to reject or to reduce its amount    The proper person
to have the inspection of these demands would be the Secretary
of the Treasury, and they would then have a  uniformity
throughout the whole Union    There would be oJtie uniform and
settled rule, and if that rule should prove incorrect or improp
er, they would at least have an officer who would be responsible
to them font, but asfoi the judges of the Supreme Court, they
were in no degree responsible     1 he judges themselves, he had
reason to know, had become—he would notsaya aimeti at, hut
they had become sensible of the enormous mcieabe in the
amount of tfiese demands , and had been engaged m adopting
rules for the purpose of diminishing them, and of keeping them
within proper and safe limits    He theiefore considered the
-pioYiso which refened these matters to the pi oper depart
ment, and relieved the judges fiom it, would be as beneficial to
the country as it would i^e satisfactory to the judges themselves
Mr PRfcSTON  came to an  opposite conclusion    if the
judges areen_aged m framing luleot  letiench expenditures, it
was agood tear-on ioi Convidas nof to interfere     Thisgeneiat
declamation, with regard to reducing the expenses of the ju
dicialdepartment, is not applicable to the presen case, which
is an exception from the general i ulc of law for the government
of thecountry    In consequence of the peculiar circumstances
of the duty at New York, an exception is made  it is a question
how iar Congress shall put its hands into the pocketsof the di<*
trictattorney, and take from it the proceeds of his labor    It
was only on the coming m oí this Administration, and of the
incumbent of the office appointed by it, that anything was
heard of this retrenchment, and them jstngid ruleisattempted
now to be applied to him    former incumbents were allowed
to pocket from twenty to thnty thousand dolíais for the same
duty the present incumbent is called upon to perform for six
thousand, that the United Slates may reap the benefit of the dif
ference
Mr BATES calculated that the effect of this proviso would
be to destroy all the emol uments of the attorney and clerk He
protested against this special and penal mode of legislation
Mr WRIGHT said he desired to direct the attention of the
Senate, for a very few moments, to the true state of the tacts,
that they might see precisely what it was that was propo ed to
be amended In the appropriation "bill of last year, Congress
had thought proper to make a limitation in the fees and perqui
sites of the different officers of the court and disti ict—a limita
tion precisely similar to that (Sioposed to be made by tm*¡ hill—

to the judge of that circuit, he would say that he entertained
a very high respect for him, as a man of the most unques
tioned purity and uprightness He would say, however, with
out designing to impute wrong intentions any where, that the
practice which had been pursued was unfortunate He was
perfectly sure that there could be no d fficulty in procuring
a competent person to dischaigethe duties of the office for a
net compensation to himself of $1500 That w >u)d be & 1 500
more than the «alary of the mayoi of the city, and he he
Sieved the pergonal labot required from the distnet attorney
was much less than that which the mayor was forced to be
etow m bis official capacity It wasalt,o &500 moie than the
aalary of the Governoi of the State, yet he (Mr Wright) did
not complain of its being too much
As to the district clerk the office was a labonoub o le and
here he would coriect the statement of the Senatoi from ¡south
Carolina, that the Attorney General of the United States had
I eft his office lor the purpose of aeoepmg that of distuct at
tor ney for the southern district of the sate of New Yoik
The teenatoi would remember tha Mi líu ler reigned a yeai
before he accepted his new aj pomtmuit, without anv expecta
lion of takmeoffice, but with the fixeipurpise of retun ia° t>
his ptivate practice The misfortunes *uid embaí raiments ol
thecountry hadrendeied that ofiee profitable to him It was
deeirable to have a man who was woi thy of the irn poi tant trust,
and for this reason he (Mr Wright)—entertaining feelings of
high personal regard towards mat gentleman—had urged hi 
acceptance of the office He (Mr Wright) felt veiy little inter
est in the matter, further than he believed it would be apparent
to all, that as an act of simple lustice, U the proveo «*re re
tamed, it should be uiadegeneral Andthesamemightbesaid
with regard to the second proviso If this were the ease, he
would vote font most cheerfully, at present, he could not
While he would admit that it was not right in principle to
raise revenue from the fees of an office, he thought it equally
wrong to bestow upon an individual an office which nets twenty
or twenty five thousand dollars The fees should be reduced
His opinion , then formed upon a due consideration of the mat
ter, was, that instead of striking outthe first proviso, it would
be better to make it general, and to add loit an inhibition against
thepe  dtem charges c f all the district attorneys, clerks, and
marshals hi the Union, of five dollars which they claimed under
the bankrupt law, because the law declared that the court
should be always in session
Mr PRESTON reargued that this was not a salary, but a
farming out of the office foi pay—the Government receiving
$20,000, and giving the officer who does the duty but $6,000
He denied the propriety of denvmg revenue from fees on suit
ors for justice It was wrong in principle, and ought to be
abolished He was in favor of ehe adoption of the New York
principle
Mr EVANS admitted that the Senator from New York was
right in principle He believed what was understood by depu
ties was, not that each officer had apermanentdenuty, but that,
on pauicutar occasions, when great press of business required
attendance at the same time m different courts, the officer
might employ a deputy for the occasion, to do what he
could not attend to himself One objection urged by the
Senator from New York was, that this proviso isa virtual repeal
of the existing Jaw of 1841 By that law the courts were al
lowed to appoint their own clerks But the bankrupt law had
increased the business, and the two couits (the circuit and
the district court) weie continually running in session toge
ther, and the judges had certified the necessity of an additional
clerk on that account As to the compensation, #4500, he
thought it a very moderate salary It was little enough for a
competent lawyer, as, besides his professional responsibilities,
large funds and disbursements are tobe intrusted to him, foi
which he is obliged to give heavy securities People do not
like to become securities for public officers, having the respon
sible disbursement of such sums of mon°y
Mr WOODBURY referred to the law of 1841, and showel
that thp provision*! amendatory of that law were framed m
conformity with the remonstrances of merchants complain
ing of the enormous lees they were subject to The sole ques
tion was whether this sum was en ugh If itie, the only way
to prevent abuse is to make it the limit As to the great re
sponsibility of the officers, there need be none, because the
moneyb with which they are intrusted can be paid into bank
in deposite and payment of deputies
Mr BUCHaN AN remarked that this was an enlightened and
practical question of economy It was whether they should
increase the expense of the Government Instead of the re
trencrment promised, he was sorry to see a disposition to in
crease rather than dimmish the public expense* The question,
he said was, was ^6 000 a fair compensation for the district
attorney of New York? Could any man doubt it No more
could have been desired two years ago, when money was
not worth half as much as it is now for one dollar will
purchase as much now as two dollars would then Here was
an allowance of 96 000 per annum to be paid in gold and sil
ver, and yet it was supposed not to be sufficient He denied
that he was one of those who was for cutting down the salaries
beyond what might be considered liberal, and adequate to the
services required to be performed He be'ieved that $b000,
to be paid in the best currency of thecountry, was amply sum
cient to command the best talents of ihe young, active, and en
teipnsmg menin thecity of New Yoik 1 here might be some
old men of good talents and plenty of means, and without en
terprise, who would not accept the office at such a salary, but
he had not a doubt they could procure the best talents
m that city for the money at such a time as this Is Con
gress prepared to give this district attorney $6000, $3,000
for a deputy and ©3,000 more for the expen&es of office^ The
Senator from bouth Carolina [Mr Prfston] complained (f
revenue being raise! from fees Was not the country payirg
its judiciary fiom thiee to four hundred thousand dollars an
nually, and was it to be said (bat, after paying the district at
torney of New York ®6 000 a year the United States shall
not retain the balance out of the $20000 fees of that office
in part payment of the enormous advaoces for the judi
cial department i When he first rose, he intended to say
that he thought the accounts of the district courts ought
to be audited at the Treasury Department, instead of by the
judges of the courts Instead of the cucums anee which he
had mentioned of the judges of the Supreme Court havmg
^een alarmed into the adoption of a rule to reform the enor
nous expenditures, being, as the Senator from South Carolina
[\Ir Preston] imagines, m favor ofleaving the matter to he
raatmed by them, it was the strongest e\ idence that gieat abu«e
had existed, and that a repetition of it ought to be prevent
ed, by giv g the auditing of the accounts to the Treaeuiy
Department
Mr MANGUM contended that the fee bill of 17S9 was so
much higher than the fee bill of the Supreme Court ¡adopted
last year that the amount foi the pre&ent year was not half
that of preceding year , and would not probably at the end of
this year exceed the salarie  to bepaid to theoffioers He did
not agtee with those who had argued that $6 COO was ample
compensation for any talent requisite foi such an officer He
laced a much higher estimate on that profesional talent and
peisonalcbaiactei which the íesponsibilities of ouch an officer
demanded
1 he question was then taken, and resulted Yeas 20, nays 18,
and so the amendment was adopted ~
The next amendment proj osed was to strike from page 23 of
the bill the following pioviso, relative to the clerk of the couit
of the southern district of New Yoik viz
lAnd pro tided-, further, That the clerk of the district contt
of said district shall also be clerk of he circuit court m an 1 for the
«ame , and that it shall not be lawful to appoint to "aid nfTices,
or continue in the sam°, a distinct person lor each othce
* The question was put, and the above was stricken out.
The next amendment proposed was to strike fiom the 23d
page of the bill the following, relating to the officers of the court
of the southern district of New York, viz
"And provided further, That hereafter it shall not be law
ful for either of said offirers to demand and receive any other
or greater fees for services rendered by them, respectively, than
now are or hereafter may bej allowed by the laws of the said
State of New York to the clerks, attorneys, and counsel, and
sheriffs, m the supreme court of said State, m which like ser*
vices are rendered"
The question waa put, and the above was stucken eut with-
out a count
The next amendment proposed was to smite from the twen-
ty third page of the bill the following provision, relating t^ the
application of the money appropriated to the southern district
court of New York, viz
"That no part of this appropriation shall be applied to the
payment of expenses incurred by printing the records of any
causea, except those wherein the Uni ted States is a party and
liable for costs  
Mr ARCHtsR asked tbe chairman ef the committee forau
explanation of this amendment
Mr EVANS explained that the printing of documents for (he
court had greatly facilitated the business The expense was
trifling, and attended with beneficial results
The amendment was agreed to without a count
Mr WHITE moved that the Sena e proceed to the consider-
ation of executive business, which wat> agreed to, and, after
some time spent in executive aession,
The Senate adjourned

NEW YORK CUSTOM HOUSE INVESTIGATION
Mr STANLY, from the Committee on Public Expenditures,
asked leave at this time to make a report
No objection being made-
Mr STANLY, from the said eommittee, submitted the fol-
lowing report
1 he Committee on Public Expenditures respectfully submit
to the House a report made by the Hon Geoige Pomdexter to
theSecretary oftheTreasury Mr Pomdexter was one of the
commissioners appointed by the President, on the 10th of May>
1841, to examine into the affairs of the cu^om house in the city
oí New York.
The committee, being apprized that the expenditures at the 
customhouse in the city of New \ork had increased very
greatly for several years past, felt bound to beeome acquaint-
ed with the nature and character of th <*e expenditures, that
the guilty mi^ht be exposed and.punched and like abuses
corrected for the future As however, the time allowed to the
committee for such an investigation was no sufficient to enable
them to attempt the investigation with any probability of hue-
ce s unless they had abandoned the sittings of theHousp,and
a& they had been informed of he nature of the duties of the
commissioners, they concluded it would be more satisfactory to
thellouseto wait the report of tliecommissioneis On the 9th
day ef February last the House of Representatives alopted a
resolution reported from the Committee mi Public expendi-
tures, requesting the Secretai y of the Tre-jsjr to send a copy

lion has yet been received Some days si ce the committee
called on the Secretary of the Treasury rn know when they
would receive an answer to the lecolunon refeired to, and
whether the report, made since the date of that resolution,
would be sent Some days elapsedj and ro answer came
Another letter was addressed to the Secretary of the Treasury,
and to thi", after waiting another day, the committee received no*
answer
The committee, knowing the general desne to be made ac-
quainted with the proceedings of the commissioners, and be*
lieving that it was due not only to the House of Representatives,
but to the American people that abuses should be exposed,
and feehuff arxions that measures might be taken during the
present session to pievent tht recurrence of the debiading
enormities practised at the custom houte, determined to call on
Mr Poindex er, one of the commissioners sni to submit the
result of his labors to the consideration of the House
This report is herewith submined The committee earnestly

Mr CUSHING said he was unwilling to interfere with pn

Vermont [Mr Evereit] had also signified his intention to offer
an amendment of an extremely complicated na urc, and if the
