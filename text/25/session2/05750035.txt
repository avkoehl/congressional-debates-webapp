law, tramples on its authority, and always hat,,and
always will find, apologists and advocates for its
most extravagant abuse*
Mr B said that the Administration had been
censured for the present condition of the cuirency
freelj in the debate on the measure then before
them It was not just noi fair thub to charge it
If there had been a harmonious co-operation
among all parties m this country in carrying into
effect the important and salutary measures lecom-
mended by the late Administration on this subject,
if, added to this, the great moneyed power of this
country had supported instead of opposed thi^
pohcv, he believed that the difficulties m it" mo-
neyed affairs which had happened would not have
occurred But instead of harmonious action
among all parties for an object of so much pub-
lic interest, the country had witnessed an opposi-
tion to the measures of the Administration ¡a. rela-
tion to the currency, and that opposition powerfully
aided and sustained, too, by much the greater por-
tion of the moneyed power, almost unequalled in
the history ot political warfare for Us violence and
the extraordinary means taken to break down the
Administration Was it at all strange-, then, under
such adverse influences, that consequences such as
had followed should have happened''
Mr B saw, in the almost simultaneous issue of
small notes, with the suspension of specie pay-
ments by the banks, but a continuation of that se-
ries of measures by which it was calculated to ef-
fects conquest over public opinion, in favor of a
national bank. Whatever may have been the
pretended necessity for It, those who were instru-
mental in issuing small notes, knew that it would
instantly dm e from circulation th3 almost entire
specu change A parallel case with that in which
the late Bank of the United States originated,
would then be furnished by a universally depre-
ciated paper currency, from the highest to the
smallest denomination, for the advocates of such an
institution to appeal to the public for a favorable
decision In the language of a newspapei, known
as one of the organs of the National Bank party,
the judgments and understandings of "the people
were no longer to be addressed, to bring them to
their senses, but their sufferings were to be relied
on to produce that result In other words, the
country was to be scourged into submission, to
compel its ob"dience to the mandates of the mo-
neyed power
Mr B said, that while many other States were
at this time suffering great evils, from having per
mitted the issue of small bills, the present condition
of the State of North Carolina, in reference to this
subject, was a practical proof ot the wisdom of her
legislation in having suppiessed them Some years
since great evils had been experienced among her
citizens, fiom the issue of small notes by indivi-
duals and corporations, m corsequence of which,
her Legislature had passed a law prohibiting it, and
imposing severe penalties on those who violated it
The effect of this has been to introduce among hei
citizens a large portion of specie change, which
was, he believed, si 11 retained in circulation, not
withstanding the suspension of specie payments by
tne banks It was true, that some inconvenience
had been experienced for the want of change after
that event occurred, but he was gratified that the
moral sense of the people of the State was stionglv
opposed to the illegal issue of small notes, and was
in favor of sustaining the law prohibiting a prac-
tice so injurious as well to public interests as to
public morals
The bill to suppress the circulation of „maU
notes in this District had been denounced as one of
pains and penalties against its < itizens and ?s par-
ticularly oppressive to the poorei class of them
Mr B called on gendemen to reconcile the incon-
sistent charges they made against those friendly to
the Administration A.t one moment they were re-
presented by them as Loco Focos and A¿iar ans,
and now as attempting to pass a law to benefit the
rich at the expense of the poor So far from injur-
ing the poor, he believed it \ ould prove protective
of their interests It would relieve them from those
innumerable fiauds which were daily practised on
the more ignorant portion of the commumtv, by
imposing on them notes issued by insolvent persons,
and every kind of spumous paper
He could not but regret the great antipathy which
some gentlemen seemed to entertain towards every
land of spe te currency. It had often been re-
marked that some peculiar constitutions had anti-
pathies to certai i objects, md he must be permitted
to say, that from the sensibility exhibited m a cer-
tain qu-Tter when gold or silver is alluded to, that
they must be the objects of a kind of constitutional
antipathy with some gentlemen
Mr B said that he considered it not only the
duty ot Congress m reference to the best interests,
of the citizens of th s District, to legislate on this
subject, but it w<ts a hign duty which it owed to the
country at large, toexeit all its authority to aid m
redeeming it ftom a species of paper ci-culation
which was an acknowledged public nuisance I
would be an example worthy the imitation of those
States now suffering undei a similar evil, and an
example which, he trusted, would be universally
followed throughout our country
REMARKS OF MR. CILLEY,
Of Maine,
In the House of Representatives, Jan. 5, 1838—On
the resolutions calling for information relative
to our relations with Mexico, and Great Britain
Mr CILLCY said he should not have troubled
the House wnh any remarks on this occasion, but
for one sentiment which had been advanced by the
Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affair,
(Mi Howjrd) That gentleman had remarked,
that whatever faith might be due to out door ru-
mors, « hit parsed m this House went for «ometh ng
At d after saymg much relative to the duty incum-
bent on our Government to main'am its neutrality,
m which I entirely concurred, he gave it, as his
opinion, that we ought to be peculiarly mild in
pressing the settlement of our Northeastern bounda-
ry, while the present difficulties existed between
the Bnti<h Government and the people of Canada
Sir, m this sentiment of the honorable chairman I
cannot acquiesce, nor will the feeling on the sub-
ject in my State pcrn*it the settlement of that ques-
tion to be delayed on any such grounds What,
sir, is the claim of the Government of Gieat Bri-
tain'! It is to one-third of the State of Mame I
will not now go into a history of it, suffice it to
say, thai during the late war, British tioops were
marched in the dead of winter from the lower pro-
vince, on the seaboard, across the upper part of
Mame to Quebec, and thus were enabled to open
the campaign in the Cañadas, and on our rear,
long before the St Lawrence broke up, and much
to the suiprise and detriment of our northern army
The discovery of this route across Mame, which,
if they could not u>e, would, for a great part of the
year, while the rivei St. Lawrence was loeked up
with ice, disconnect the uppei and lower pro-
vinces, induced the British Government, while ne-
gotiating the treaty of peace at Ghent, to a'k a
cession ot so much of the temtoiy of Maine, then
Massachusetts, as thus inte-vened between New
Brunswick and Lowei Canada They did not
ask the cession with a view to acqui e
territory as such, but merely for the pur-
pose of connecting the two provinces ind
left the proposition open to oai commissioners
to asi a i equivalent For the correctness of what
I now say, I appeal to the honorable genti tmn
now m my eye, (Mr Adams, of Massachuse ts,)
who was then one of the eonimissioneis The
British «ere answeied promptly by our commis-
sioners, that they had no power to treat for the ces-
sion of a portion of the territory of one of the
Slates of this Union No arrangement oi this
kind was effected, and the boundaiy line, according
to the treaty of '83, remained unaltered Bit find
ing they could not obtain by cession, they had
boldly and shamelessly set up a cUim to it m the
very face of that treaty They claimed it because
it v as so convenient for them to ha re it, because
they wanted it, and from no just cause or pretext
whatever for, sir, I will mamta n, and challenge
contradiction, that the treaty of 1783 was as plain
and clear as language could speak, and the true
boundary as obvious, nay, conspicuous, as the
everlasting hills and highlands which are described
as forming it, and which divided the sti earns which
ran into the river St. Lawrence from those which
descended towards the ocean. What is it, sir, that,
for hundre is of miles, \\ alls up, on the south, ¡hegreat
basin through which the nrer St. Lawrence flows?
Highland1, sir, and from these, streams s-flow north-
erly into that mighty river, and southerly and east-
erly into the Atlantic ocean. Now these highlands,
so conspicuous on the face of the earth, are our an-
cient and well-defined landmarks. Yet, sir, jn
mockery of these, in spite of a solemn treaty, the
British seize possession of our soil, drive, by armed
force and the terror of prisons, our citizens from
it, though claiming title by deeds directly to them
from two States of this Union, Maine and Massa-
chusetts, thus keeping back our settlements, im-
peding the growth and prosperity of our State, and
destroying our invaluable and never to be replaced
forests of timber, simply and solely because they
want the territory to connect their provinces.
Under this state of things, was it incumbent on
this House or this nation to be so peculiarly mild
in pressing the immediate settlement of this, line?
I admit that ours is a Government of peace; but
have we not manifested a most pacific spirit? The
people of Maine have been long forbearing in this
matter, they have an immense interest at stake in
preserving peace, one of their greatest means of
prosperity, and even of livelihood, was derived
from the peaceful prosecution of their commerce
and their fisheries Their interests, as well as their
feel ngs, will not permit them thoughtless'y or
wiongfully to provoke war, but they cannot submit
to indignity and gross usurpation , they will not sit
quiet and see their State dismembered They had
already seen the whole question of the extent of
their temtoiy submitted, against their most s >lemn
protestations, to a foreign arbitration, and yet,
though the arbitrator was held at the time by the
Government of Great Bniam as in the palm of its
hand, shame prevented him from so manifest a vio-
lation of common honesty, as to decide against us.
So he gave no award on this question, but con-
tented himself with suggesting what he would con-
sider a convenient boundary for the British Both
Governments have concurred that it was no deci-
sion, and have not adopted the new line that was
recommended
Tne Senate advised the opening a new negotia-
tion Our Government have toed it how have
they been met? By no corresponding spirit of con-
ciliation on their side Indeed, the British do the
same as refuse to treat. But forbearing as my con-
stituents aie, any man would greatly mistake their
character vi ho should suppose they would ever con-
sent to give up one-third of the territory of their
State to the graspi ng usuipations of a foreign Go vern-
¡i ent They would never yield so much as an inch
of it on such ground' Sir, it is my opinion that it is
lime for this Government to be peculiarly all ve on
this subject, and in expressing this, I am sure I
speak the sense of the people of Maine there is no
di' i>ion on this question The true course was to
see vnd be sure we were in the right, then to be
firm ->nd rest lute Did any man believe that a
British Parliament could be induced to go to war
to es ablish a claim like that wh ch had been set
up to a part ol our clearly defined teintory'* Where
was its justice' There was none in the case They
know it, and feel it Hence they wJl not treat,
but hold on, on the principle that might makes
n^nt Let our Government be firm, and the ques-
tion womd be settled, Maine ca mot, and ought
not, suffer it any longer to be postponed, on any
pretext whatever In saying this, I well know and
speak the feelings of the people of Maine. I can-
not, therefore, respond to the sentiments expressed
by the honorable chairman of the Committee on
Foreign affairs, that this was a juncture which
called upon us for language of peculiar mildness
and forbearance On the contrary, when we were
called to give more power to the President, to re-
strain our private citizens from encroachments on
the rights of another Government, it was a lime
for us to be peculiarly firm and resolute in insisting
that out territory should be kept inviolate from the
most unjust eneioachments oi that very Quveta.-
