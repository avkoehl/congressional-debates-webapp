Interference in Elections-~-Mr. Preston.
Senate.
will be open and avowed the President wants my vote,
and11 want his patronage , 1 will vote as he wishes, and he
will give me the office I wish for Whit will this be but
the Government of one man, and what is the Government
of one man but a monarchy >   Names are nothing "
Perhaps 1 have satisfied the Senate m reading
from all the wife objections to this report, and I
now put jt to gentlemen whether it would not
be proper for them, if they will not censure this
report, to declare their disapprobation of what
the Senator from Missouri expressed on this sub-
ject in 3823 Such were his sentiments then;and
yet we have now declared in this report that office-
holders are not in conflict with the people, and
more thereport has argued (page 4) that the pat-
ronage of the Government is a disadvantage to
those in office, and that, on the whole, they would
be better without patronage But, if it is so, let
them cease to exercise it They say these offi-
cers have notmterfered Sir, is not this erroneous,
and in the face of the fact thioughout the coun-
try ' Where have these gentlemen been ' All
these officeis are continually engaged tn the elec-
tions everywhere Every officer of this Govern-
ment is an electioneering outpost Sir, 1 would
not discuss the matter m the face of a fact of that
kind Theie are twelve thousand postmasters,
of which, perhaps, one thousand makea pecuniary
sacrifice for the office, and I usually take it for
granted that where there is an act of self-depriv-
ation the occupant is a Whig But show me the
office of which the income is $200, or more, where
they are not continually tugging at electioneering
for the Administration We have a postmaster
in oui own little village, who i¿ a most thorough
electioneers, devoting his days and nights to that
praiseworthy employment, and in his little ca-
boose of a post office I have found electioneering
interferences, which the honorable gentlemen of
the committee musthavebeeii able to discover if
ihey had been on the spot? At-the times of elec-
tions, the office is unusually*- mctfmbered with
electioneenng ptmphlets % liafé*s%eri the room
ciowded all up with " adéreseos to the Republi-
can party," calling on the people of" the United
■"Hates to support this A-dministration1- (daugh-
ter ] After a public meeting at the Capitol, scraps
from General Jackson, the Globe, &c , were
served up as a cold hash for breakfast, and were
sent forth to the country as the manifesto of the
Republican party I cast my eyps aiound the
post office, and there, in staring capitals, were to
deseen, " Glonous Triumph '" " The erect De-
mocracy have carried Constantinople'" "Grand
newsfiom Alabama'" " The Democratic party
in the ascendency'" "One hundred guns '"and
iheie piesent, with his wand, was the master of
ihesecabalistics, putting the question, "Will you
not-vote for the Democratic party'" He was ad-
vocating the principle which the party once
avowed, " Principle in proportion to inteiest'"
And now I put it to Senators whether any one
will use in his place and say, on his honoi, that
lie believes Federal officers do not pay a tax, pío
lata, for electioneering purposes Will any gen-
tleman even say that he doubts it' [No sign ] I
do not yet assert it, but do we not know it' Ido
not especially urge this as an attack on the piesent
Administration, but it is in the natuieof these
thmgswhen theyire underinstructionsfrom hij;h
quarteis to that efTi ct The Senator from New
Yoik says it is the duty of office holdeis to inter
fere in elections
Mr WALL There is nothing of that in the
report
Mi PRESTON I have just read it to the
Senate And the Senator from Pennsylvania says,
if he weie Piesident, he would appoint officeis of
his own political pnnciples
Mr BUCHANAN, m a low tone, was under-
Stood to say cithei that he should not be President,
oi that he did not make the supposition that he
might be Piisulent
Mi PRESTON May be so, but the gentle
man represented it as thi duty of the Piesident
to appo nt men only of his own pinieipks And
what then lit would have none m office but
mill of his party And then what' He would
have one bundled thousand men bought and paid
foi, lnitui d with the spmt and pnnctplcs of one
man And will gentlemen say that all this would
give the p-irty no suppoit'    WiH they say they
would have lost ground notwithstanding' Ay,
sir, and but for these, how long ago would their
political stionghold at New York have been
broten up * What has been done there with their
millions at the custom-house, which have at length
proved unavailing' And I hope that in spite of
these myrmidons, they will effectually storm that
fortress, and that the party are doomed by the
handwriting already on the wall
Sir, I had hoped, from the growing w6f(fe>6ss
of the partyin power, they would have manífefi^d
a disposition to reform But this report uldlijds
that prospect, and there is again every causé of
alarm I have seen that their ultimate purposes,
when matured and manifested, cannot out revolt
every honest and patriotic mind, and I say there
is a natural condemnation in our bosoms of the
interference of office holders in elections No man
really approves it And I will venture to say
that there is no gentleman now on this floor who
will say in teims that he approves it. There is
an impropriety which we ourselves feel, if we
would but announce it, in entering the canvass
for the purpose of sustaining or prolonging our
power But all the principles of liberty on this
subject come from the minority for the time
being, and they are in uniform contrast with the
doct?ines of the leport of the Senator from New
Jersey.
Sn, in what condition do we find oui selves in
regard to the question of patronage' It became
the duty of a distinguished member from South
Carolina [Mr Calhoun] to examine into and to
report on the power of the Executive, and its
alarming increase within a few years, and, in
doing that, he pointed out the vaiious souiees of
this powei, and spoke of this veiy souice as en
dangenng the libeities of the country In this
repoit the subject was moie expanded than in
that of the Senator fiom Missouri, and it was
made eight years afterwaids, when Executive
power had assumed a more fearful aspect [Mr
P read some passages fiom this repoit, in which
it was said that so long as offices were considered
as a public trust, they were filled with those who
would best and most faithfully perform the duties
of office, but that gradually a great change had
been effected, so that a faithful peiformance of
duty no longer assured an appointment to office,
or a continuance in it, and it might in truth be
said that the expenditures of the revenue had be
come corrupt and subservient to corruptions ]
Sir, there are twenty passages of this kind, but
I will not consume the time of the Senate in ad
vertmg to them They are full of wisdom, and
yet all this is now denounced which it was the
policy of this bill to carry into piactical effect,
and it is declaied unconstitutional, unwise, and
tyrannical
Mi P further remarked that this report was
made five years ago, that the lapidly increasing
pationage of the Government was then held up
as gieatly alaimmg, that fiom the Admimstia
tion of Mi Adams to that time, which was nine
years, theip had been an increase of annual ex-
penditure from £12,000,000 to $25,000,000, and
now, in five years moie, it had increased to
$40,000,000 And now, with such an inciease
befoie us, will gentlemen tell us that theie is no
dangei fiom this souice, and that it is wiong to
guaid against it' They have he ud the testimony
of Mi Jefferson, of De Witt Clinton, of Andiew
Jackson, and of others distinguished among
themselves, and now , if they sanción the doe
tnnes and principles of this repoit, they will suo-
vert all that these gentlemen have said on this
subject
But, sn, I will take higher ground than all this
All the essential pnnciples of hbeity known in
the history of our ancestoi s, are repugnant to the
abominable principles of this leport Well and
consistently d d the gentleman act in flouting and
lepudiating the free doctrines of our Euioptan
ancestois Well does it become him, undei a
democratic Government, to denounce all control
of public officeis, ay, and when monaiclucjl Eu-
rope, with its Kings and its despotic laws, jtt
impose fcttois. on tl en executive orneéis fot the
security of popu'ai ngl ts, and the gcntlem-ui's
mind is all on fire in behalf of the Ameucan Gov-
ernment and its libeities, as the liberties of the
people     He says that tins resuiction of execu-
tive officers is a tribute to English despotism, and
so, in the same way, would oui restrictions be a
tribute to office-holders English liberty says
the wolf shall be caged, but the gentleman says,
no, keep down the iron bars, he is a part of the
flock    English despotism'
I know, sir, it has been a trick with certain
politicians of this country to denounce anything
that is English But I have not the heart to de-
nounce the native country of liberty, which has
erected the proudest and most glorious temple of
freedom of any country in Europe She is an old
nation, pioud in arms, and has long battled in the
cause of hbei ty through blood and carnage And
she has propagated it in this country Think
you that we should have found it without her '
Heis was the native soil of our freedom and our
blood And did it ever stagnate in our veins or
blanch in the fight' No, sir, no, wheiever it is
found, in Europe, Asia, Afi ica, or America, where
ever the sun has blazed upon it, Us native tint
remains indelible, and we still feel proud of our
blood, and honoied fiom oui lllustnous ancestors
4mi yet you say they have fought for despotism
theie, while meffect you aie so making manacles
for our people as no one there dare do Since
the time of Walpole, no English Mimstei would
have dared to present such a report as this He
could not have done it and retained his p'ace.
The King of England, fiom the house of Ilano-
vei, whose Geiman notions wcie not yet oblit-
erated, denounced the bill restncting his execu
tive officeis,and called ita villainous bill, and the
King's language in this was the language of a
King But the Commons and the people held a
diffeient language, and determined that the King
should take the bill, villainous though it might
be
And when such was the language of the Brit-
ish Commons, what is said ofaButish lord, with
blue ribbons' One instance of the interference
of the Executive with the elective fianchise was
biought before the Commons in this wise
[Mi P read fiom history, that the almoner of
the Queen in the county of Woicestei wiote to
several of his fnends, soliciting them to oppose
1 the election of one of the candidates for Parlia-
ment The Commons voted that this was a vio-
lation of the liberty of the people, and asked the
ftueen to dismiss the offender from office, and the
Gtueen dismissed him accoidmgly Mr P also
read anothei example of the kind, which occui red
in 1779, when an executive officer was detected,
in the county of Southampton, taking paitin the
election, and when the case was brought befoie
the House of Commons, Lord Noith remaiked
that it was a case in legaid to which theie was
no great cause for alarm, and instantly, on all
sides of the House, the remark was followed by
such indignant cfamois and upioar that Lord
Noith was compelled to explain, and the House
foithwith adopted a lesolutton that it was highly
ciiminal for an executive officei to use his office
in influencing elections to Pailiament ]
Thus, under what gentlemen call a despotic
Government, were the libeities of the people
lealously guaided and protected and wheiever
theie is powei and pationage and interference of
this kind, they aip part and paicel of the Gov
ernment Lven there,an mteif lence in elections
by a li tter of an offieci of the Crown was In Id an
indignity, and the silence of Loid Noi 111 in legard
to it has conseei ited it to us as the evidence of
the genuine spmt of Bntish libeuy Sn,Icall
on Sen-vtois to place some mailc of then repioba-
tion on the repoit which has been submitted to us
Mi Piesident, I did not feel myself called on
to suppoit the bill, because for that task I deemed
the ability of the Senator fiom Kentucky abun-
dant, and I snould not now have tioubled the
Semte, but that I was alarmed at the doctunes
of tins report, and at the fact that gentlemen were
about to send them thiough the eountiy as the
pinieiplcs of the paity in powei, on whieh they
intend to act If gc ntlemen do so, the peop'e
will be f ne vvarned and foieaimed, and, knowing
the pui poses of those in powei, they will be
sufficiently notified that t ley ought to be oi the
