aiding said State in the construction of a canal to
connect the Ohio canal with the Pennsylvania
canal, bv way of what is cal'ed the Sandy and
Beavei íoute

qui!5, if he gentleman would modify it so as to

Aftei  some opposition to the íesolution fiom
Mi   WHITTLESEY, of Ohio,                               '
Mr STEWART moved to amend the resolu
t.on, by stnkmg out that part which gives any
land to the State of Ohio, and tne latter clause,
which in hcates ti e ron e Tne subject, he con
tended, piopeily be'onged to the Committee on
Roads and Canals, as the proposition was to make
a canal
Mr THOMSON said tnat if the amendment
should be adopted, he «duuld be compelled to vote
against his o#n resolut on His object was to
co meet the Omo and the Pennsylvania canal and
he piesumed that his colleague, [Mr WrnrTLL-
srY,] w ose opposition to the íesolution had sur
i i ed inn, v as m favor of the same o'ject, though
he hal in wew adiríetent íou e from th fpiopo ed
in the íesclui en He we t oi to make some re-
marks in avoi of he route which he had pro
pos"J                                                             ,        ,
Mi WHITTLESEI «raid he o'jected to the
designation of any ioute in tne íesolution, and es
pecnllv ot o le wrucn had been conuemned by
, eveiy peiso" who had examined it
1 Mi STEWART made some lemarks in sup-
| poit of Ins motion to anend The proposition
I  was to give the land to the State of Ohio, that the
State of Ohio might sell it and subscribe the pro-
ceeds to the s'ock of the company He did not
see why the Government should not make the
subscription to* stock, whether it was m land or
money, and the benefit of it
Mr THOMSON made some statement m
support of his views of the eligibility of the route
designated in the íesolution He had, however,
determined, rathei than continue the debate, to
accept the amendment as a modification of the
resolution
Mi FULLER, of New York, said if there was
to be an inquiry, he would like to have it extended
a little fuither We in New Yoik (said he) would
like to have a cenal fiom Rochestei to Olean, and
¿ e happen not to have any public land The
canal would terminate on the Alleghany river, and
would be highly important to all the interests be-
low The work contemplated by the resolution
was highly important, but not more so than this
Mr STEWART said that, without objecting
to the proposition of the gentleman from New
Yoik, he thought he had better offer it in a dis-
tinct resolution
Mr FULLER I think not I would a great
deal rathei be in good company than alone Both
canals were important, and are connected with the
same interests He accoidmgly offered his amend-
ment, instructing the committee also to inquire
into the expediency of making a giant of land for
the purpose of constructing a canal from Rochester
to Olean
