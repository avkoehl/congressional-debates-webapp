HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,March 29, 1865.

Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Can I get either Braxton's, Cutshwa's, or Nelson's battalions to man guns on intermediate line from Brook pike to James River, above Richmond? Artillery horses cannot probably be furnished soon to equip them again.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.

Captain SMITH S. LEE,

Navy Bureau, Richmond:

Instead of manning Chaffin's Bluff can you let the marines and sailors man the guns on intermediate line about Richmond? We can use there as many men as you can give us.
