LA FOURCHE,

June 20, 1863.

Brigadier-General EMORY:

Thus far we have repulsed them. We do not know their force in our front.

ALBERT STICKNEY,

Lieutenant Colonel.
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,June 20, 1863.

Lieutenant-Colonel IRWIN:

If a division could be spared to Donaldsonville, and march on the trail of the enemy, now ascertained to be 4,000, they would be captured. The gunboat at Brashear will keep them from crossing. But it must be done quickly, or Brashear falls.

W. H. EMORY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,June 20, 1863.

Lieutenant-Colonel STICKNEY:

Colonel Cahil, with strong re-enforcements of infantry and artillery, is now getting ready to support you. Hold the enemy in check, and fight him boldly. He is not as strong as you estimate.

W. H. EMORY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LA FOURCHE,

June 20, 1863.

Brigadier-General EMORY:

We are all ready for fighting when they come. I shall feel easy when the re-enforcements come. We can give them a good fight, and, if we have enough men, can whip them thoroughly. They captured toward 100 men, convalescents, I think, at Thibodeaux. I don't know who was to blame; some one.

Respectfully,

ALBERT STICKNEY,

Lieutenant-Colonel.
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,June 20, 1863.

Lieutenant-Colonel STICKNEY:

Have you the Bayou Boeuf road and crossing well guarded? The enemy may come down on that road. Your scouts at Napoleonville should be able to notify you.

Keep your train all ready to defend either point.

By command of W. H. Emory, brigadier-general commanding:

W. D. SMITH,

Lieutenant Colonel, and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
