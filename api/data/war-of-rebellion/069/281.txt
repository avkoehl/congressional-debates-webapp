(Received 12.15 p. m.)

A. S. KIMBALL,

Captain, Assistant Quartermaster.

FORT MONROE, May 28, 1864.

Major General B. F. BUTLER:

We must run telegraph to reach Grant. Two routes are in view; by the old orad from Williamsburg direct to White House, thence up north side of Pamunkey River, or across at Yorktown and up north side York River, crossing the Mattapony to West Point and thence up that peninsula. Will the commanding general indicate which route he can best ;protect; and, also, give the necessary orders for the protection and assistance in the work? It must be done as soon as possible.

G. D. SHELDON.

FORT MONROE, May 28, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

Since sending my dispatch General Halleck has given his opinion that the north side of York River is best route, as it can be guarded by small force.

G. D. SHELDON.

FORTH MONROE, VA., May 28, 1864.

[Major ECKERT:]

On consulting General Carr, commanding at Yorktown and Williamsburg, he says: "It would be practicable to run a telegraph from Gloucester to West Point if the country was occupied by our forces. I think the old road from Williamsburg to West Point the best." I fear we wi;; be troubled to get guards by either road, as everything appears to be absorbed by present movements.

G. D. SHELDON.
