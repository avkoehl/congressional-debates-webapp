No Tieasury drafts, contingent or other, «ere
furoisned to the Union Bank of Maiyland during
t'ie month of March, 1834 And no transfer draft
of any desciiption, contingent or otnei, has ever
been furnished to the Bank of Mai j land since I
cam  into office
In aiiiwei to that part of the resolution which
calls foi nf >r^~at on as to tne amount of stock held
by Roger B Taney in the Union Bank of Mary-
lind, " wnen the said Lank was se ected as one of
' the banks to leceivein deposite the public money,
'and what amour t of the said stuck he now holds,"
I have the honor to s ate, that, mastnu h as the
inquiry does not embrace the s ocKholde-s genei
ally, but is confined to the stock of a paiticular
individual, it must, by necessa y implication, be
understood as pointing the mquuy to the motives
which influenced the individual named in the
tialisacfions he may have had in the stock of the
said bank, and, ui del such circumstance , it is
due to his offi"ial relations to the Senate, and to
tiie public, that his motives in any such transac
uoiis shou'd be fu'ly and clearly d selosed I
theiefore transmit to the Senate a copy of a lettei
from this depar ment to the Presiden^oftheUtuon
Bank of Maryland, dated the 31st day of Much,
1834 apprizing him of tne information required
by the Senate, requesting h m to forwaid to the
department a statement ot the amourt of stock in
the Union Bank of Maryland held by Rogei B
Taney at the time the deposites were removed—
time at which it was purchased—and the amount
now held by him—and theonginal private letter
of Roger B Taney, authorizing him to sell certain
shares of stock which were lately sold
Also, the letter from the President of the Union
Bank of Maryland, m reply, da'ed April 1,1834,
enclosing the statements and papers above nen-
tion d, whi^h are herewith transmitted, and areas

was witnessed at tne apnioaching termination of I
the first ba ik 11 arte  in 1811, when there was no
íemovil of ue¡ ooites to be charged with the dis-
t   ses  of the* co^n ly      VI!   the   macnieiy of

I   st idled and piemeditated attempt to operate upon
j   Congiess th ough the alatms of th  people ariu the
destruc ion ot tnen proper y   TI ere was not even
a cuitailment of discounts then The whole scene
I was f ct aous, but it was a ca^e in which fiction
dies the mischief of truth A false alarm m the
j rrnney maiket produces all the effects of real dan
ger, and thus as much distress «as proclaimed in
. Congiessin 1811—as mucn distie s was proved
' to exist, and re lly did exist, then as now—with
|| out a single cause  to be alleged then  which is
II  alleged now     But the po*er and organization of
the bank made the alarm then, its power and
organization make it now, and fictitious on both
occasions, and men were ruined then as now by
the power of imaginary danger, which, in the
rnonejed woi'd, has all the ruinous eflects of real
dangei No depo i'es were remo\ed 'hen, and the
leason was, a3 assigned by Mr Gallatin to Con-
giess, that the Government had borrowed more
than the amount of the deposites fiom the bank,
and this loan would enable her to protect her
interest in every contingency The open object of
the bank then, was a lecharter The knights
enteied tne list with their v zors off—no war in
disguise then foi the renewal of a char er under
tie tilting and jous i igof a masquerade scuffle for
recovery of deposites
rtia' the re^l o'biect of all this alai m m the coun-
tiy—a'l this niesjuieupon som  paitó of the coun-
try— or tie section south of tne Potomac had
enjoyed a remarkabl  exemption—he was, per-
mute 1 lo believe, was to secuie ihe recharter of
me bank Such must have been the design of the
baik and the marn^r in which the bill for the
rechai er was brought forward, and then laid over,
cei laii ly favored the i lea It was brought for-
ward under an agonizing cry of distress, and a
venement appeal ior immediate relief from actual,
ins ifferable distiess it was then laid down that
it might no mter'eie with another debate, that
other debate came to a close m two days, then
the bill whic1  was fixed for the first of May,
was taken up to be fixed again for the 21st of
April and before the 2Jst of April came, a set of
impoi'ant elec ions will take place in thetwogreat
States of New York and Virginia Thus, after
working the machinery of alarm for three months,
and filling the Union with cues for the restoration
of the deposites, the bank suddenly presents a
demand foi a rechur ei, and then adiourns that
demand, urgent as it night be, until certain im-
portant elect ons were over
Mi B remarked upon the political character of
this bank He said it was born a political insti-
tution, and wis the first measure of the Govern-
ment to develop the line which so lore and so
distinctly mark d the political parties ot this coun-
try The ceation of this bank went to theongm
of party it went to the source where parties
should be formed—to principles, to great and fun-
damental prncnles in the administration of the
Government It involved the question of con-
structive and of granted poweti>, and was the
entering wedge to all the implied powers after-
wards assumed by Congress Prohibitory tariffs,
lucal in ernal improvement, and the whole Amer-
ican system He said the bank was the head
of the Ameucan system, and if it was «char-
tered, it would reestablish that system in greater
power and glory than it ever possessed That it
would do so was pioved (he said) by what it was
now doing, stiuggling foi those deposites which
weie the fiuit of the hign tariff policy—struggling
for money which many a gentleman held to have
been unconstitu'iona'ly levied, and therefore not
levied at all, but taken toituousty He warned
gent'emen who were opposed to the American
system, not now to reestablish tl is eldest and
strongest member of that system, and wlieh, if
rtes ablished, would certainly «et up the whole
family again, especially tnat high tariff which fur-
nished h"r witn those surpluses of revenue, for the
keeping of which she now shows such an invin-
cible inclination
Mr B remarked upon the resolution which
spoke oi the exclusion of the Go vemnen t directors
fiom a knowledge and paiticipation in the affairs
of the bank, foi the purpose of lemtnding the
American p°opie that there were no Government
duectirsat this time in tne bank The institution,
in its management, was now a merepnvate affair,
goiernetl by the directors of the individua! stock-
ho ders, wieldu gand u^ing the money, the name,
th  character, and the influence of the United States,
pieeiselyas tney pleased The immense power
which the Gov rnment had put into the hands of
the bank was no v ísed independently of the Gov-
ernment, and in the absence of diiectors,it became
a matter of the highest moment to the people to
nave atnorough investigation into the affairs of the
bank, to see how far its tremendous powers had
been used for good or for evil, for favor or affec-
tion, for the relief or oppression of the American
