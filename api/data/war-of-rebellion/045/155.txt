BALTIMORE, MD., June 16, 1863-1. 30 p. m.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

The attack at Harper's Ferry is about commencing. I fear Tyler cannot hold out long, even on Maryland Heights, without speedy aid. General Kelley's official reports appear to have been strangely erroneous. Tyler reports total effective force at Harper's Ferry and on the Heights 4, 680. Can you promise any re- enforcement; if so, when?

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.

Colonel N. WILKINSON, Grafton, W. Va.:

Yes; you take troops eastward to New Creek, excepting garrisons or guards to be left at block-houses or bridges.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

BALTIMORE, June 16, 1863.

Colonel N. WILKINSON,

Clarksburg, W. Va.:

You do not seem to understand the orders. The last order yesterday morning was to concentrate at New Creek and not at Grafton. You will at once communicate with Colonel Mulligan, and proceed with forces there. General Kelley will arrive at New Creek to-day, by way of Harrisburg and Huntington. Until he takes command, telegraph your movements and communications to me.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

BALTIMORE, June 16, 1863.

Commanding Officer,

Cumberland, Md.:

Let Colonel Galligher and all the cavalry that are with him remain at Cumberland, reporting for duty and for orders to Brigadier-General Kelley, who will arrive to-day at New Creek.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

BALTIMORE, June 16, 1863.

General LOCKWOOD,

Point Lookout, Md.:

You will take steps to concentrate your command immediately for service on the Baltimore and Washington Railroad. A steamer will leave here to-day, and as many troops as you can send on her must come immediately.

By order:

DONN PIATT,

Chief of Staff.
