WINCHESTER, TENN., July 22, 1863.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: I am directed by General McCook to inform that he leaves for Nashville, Tenn., this morning, to be absent from this place and his command three or four days. As his absence will place you in command of the corps, and in the name of the general, I take great pleasure in inviting you and such of your staff as you may wish to bring with you to these headquarters to pass the interval while you are in command. This is a more central position than Cowan, and you will find every convenience here to enable you to conduct business. The general will take his aides-de-camp with him; also his chief of artillery.

I have the honor to be, general, your obedient servant,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
