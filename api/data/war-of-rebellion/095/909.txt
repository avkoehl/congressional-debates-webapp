ADDENDA.

Address of General Meade, April 17, 1865, to officers and soldiers presenting battle-flags captured by the Sixth Corps.

Offices and soldiers of the Sixth Corps, I thank you very much for these numerous proofs of your valor, captured during the recent campaign. I do not wish to make any invidious distinctions between your own and the other corps of this army. They performed with valor and courage the part assigned to them. But candor compels me to say that in my opinion the decisive movement of this campaign which resulted in the capture of the Army of Northern Virginia was the gallant and successful assault of the Sixth Corps on the morning of the 2nd of April. It was with much pleasure I had received a dispatch from your commander assuring me his confidence in your courage wa so great that he felt confident of his ability to break through the enemy's lines. I finally ordered the charge to be made at 4 o'clock on the morning of the 2nd and it was with still greater satisfaction that a few hours afterward I had the pleasure of transmitting a dispatch to the general-in-chief telling him the confidence of your brave commander had been fully borne out.

To you, brave men, I return the thanks of the country and of the army. To each of you a furlough of thirty days will be granted to enable you to present these proofs of your valor to the War Department. Le us all hope that the work upon which we have been engaged for nearly four years is over, that the South will return to its allegiance, and that our beloved flag will once more float in triumph over a peaceful and undivided country extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from the Saint Lawrence to the Gulf of Mexico.
