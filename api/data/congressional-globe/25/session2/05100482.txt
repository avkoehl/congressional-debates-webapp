ARMY BILL
On motion of Mr McKAY, the House then wont into Com
mittte ofthe Whole on the Union, Ml INGHAM in the chair,
on the bill to increase the military establishment ofthe Baited
States
The question was on the substitute of the Committee on Mih
tary Affairs, which proposed to increase the army to about
\S   ' 'feSS'-SÍIbl" ""¡¡meriting it tu upwards of 1 J,000
Mi BRONsON addiessed the House at lergth on the merits
ofthe bill, going at large into the condition of oui Western and
Noithern lronuers,withaview to demonstiate the necessity ot
its passage Mr B also went into a m i"s of minute details
contrasting the expenses of militia or volunteers and regular
uoldiers, being a difference of about fiom four (or perhapssix)
to one, without reference to the question of efficiency, and the
more indirect loss to the country from taking men suddenly
irom their ordinary pursuits Mr B said thai, though he
was favor ofthe larger number, yet he pielerrcd the bill rerom
mended by the House committee, as being mom perfect in its
provisions
Before the question was taken, the peuod amved for the
House to take lis daily recess
EViNING   SESSION
As soon as the House contened, it went into
committee, resuming the consideration of the
ARMY BILL
Mr. BRONSON concluded hih lemarks m sup-
port of the bill
Mr. HARRISON of Missouri, was opposed to
the amendment of the Military Commitlee, as alto-
gether inadequate for the object contemplated It
would be insufficient to provide for the protection
of the Western frontier. Mr. H was, however,
opposed to pioceeding in so thin a House, with
scarcely fifty members present.
Mr. MASON of Ohio, suggested ihat they either
proceed or take the question on the amendment.
The question was then taken on tV substitute to
the first clause, when it was agreed to
Mr. McKAY, under instructions Horn the MiU-
taiy Committee, moved an amendment to the se-
cond clause, providing for an additional regiment
of infantry.
Mr. HARRISON moved a further amendment
to rais>e a regiment of riflemen in addition thereto,
and proceeded lo give his reasons for the superior
efficiency of such a corps
Mr. McKAY cited a section of the hill intended
to meet the very object the gentleman had in view,
for the President was thereby authorized to con-
vert any of the regiments of infantiy into one of
riflemen, whenever it should be ueerned expet'ien'
Mr. HARRISON rejoined that such a ¡sub>-t -
tution would not ensure the requisite skill and effi-
ciency. He was not for giving ibis discretion to
the President, but for having the corps organized
at the start.
Mr. CRARY inquired if there were any rifle-
men or light infantry at present belonging to the
army?
Mr. McKAY replied that they were not, though
that description of force was contemplated in the
section he had just referred to.
Mr. CRARY then was of opinion that Mr. Har-
rison's amendment was a very proper one, for
that description of force could alone be effective
against Indians.
Mr. GRENNELL opposed the amendment as
altogether unnecessary from the provision re-
ferred to
Mr THOMPSON went into Ihe general merits
of the bill, and expressed his decided opposition to
any further increase of the army than was abso-
lutely necessary, and his objections would have
still greater weight, but for ihe confidence he had
in the present Secretary of Wai, to whom he had
always been opposed m politics, and most probably
always should The bill, and the substitute of the
military committee, propostd too great an augmen-
tation Mr T. was for filling up the present regi-
ments in rank and file, and gave notice of an
amendment he intended to move, which would
make an aggregate inctease of 2,500 men only.
The ordnance company ought to be increased, but
not by abstracting from the artillery corps, as pro-
posed, which could not spare any diminution He
v.^i, opposed also to an increase of the officers,
except that of major-general of the aimy, for ihe
present office wat, merely a ministerial one, for a
minister for the army to reside near the Govern-
ment of the United States.
Mr. POPE was opposed to raising a large mili-
tary force under the influence of imaginary danger
for he could not bring himself to believe we wer
