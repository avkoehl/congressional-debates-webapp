APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[December A,
37th Cong....3d Sess.
Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
Senate & Ho. of Reps.
that the results of the current fiscal year or next
willexhibitasimilarproportion. On thecontrary,
the estimate of the public debt on the 1st of July,
i863>heretoforesubmitted,mustnow be advanced,
in view of the unexpected increase of expendi-
tures, authorized and incurred, or likely to be
incurred, to §1,122,297,403 24; and on the suppo-
sition that the war may be continued with undi-
minished disbursements until the 1st of July, 1864,
the debt likely to have been then incurred must
be estimated at $1,744,685,586 80.
It has been the care of the Secretary to reduce
the cost of the debt, in the form of interest, to the
lowest possible amount, and it is,a source of real
satisfaction to him that he hasbeen able,thus far, to
confine it within very moderate limits. The first
loans, being of a magnitude hitherto undreamed of
in our market, were neccssanly made at an inter-
est which heregarded as high, though lenders stren-
uously insisted on higher; but large amounts are
now obtained at five and four per cent., while the
circulation of United States notes constitutes prac-
tically a loan from the people to their Government
without interest. The average rate on the whole
loan is thus reduced to four and three fifths per
cent. Whether a similar result may attend future
loans must be determined partly by the legtsla-
fcioijfof Congress, partly by the conduct of the
war, and partly by the condition of the markets
for money.
The statements of the actual and estimated re-
ceipts and expenditures for the last and the current
fiscal year, in comparison with those of the De-
cember report, must undergo modifications similar
to those of the public debt. Both receipts and ex-
* penditures for the current and the following year
will be increased: the former by the operations of
the augmented tariff and of the internal revenue,
and the latter by the exigencies of the war.
The aggregate receipts for the fiscal year
1862, from all sources, including the balance of
$2,257,065 80 in the Treasury from the preceding
year, were #583,885,'247 06; and the aggregate
expenditures §570,841,700 25; leaving a balance
in the Treasury on the 1st day of July, 1862, of
$13,043,546 81. From the receipts and from the
expenditures should be deducted the amounts both
received and disbuised within the year on account
of permanent and temporary debt, amounting to
$96,096,922 09; leaving the total of receipts not
applied in payment of debt $487,7HS,324 97, and
the total ofcurrentdi.shursenients#l74,744)778 16.
As the amount of debt, so also the amount of the
expenditures for the last year falls short of the
estimates.
The actual receipts for the first quarter of the
fiscal year 1863, commencing July 1, J 862, appear
from the books of the Treasury; the receipts for
the three remaining quarters can only be estimated
on the ba.sis of appropriations made and asked for
by the several Departments. They have been and
are estimated as follows:
For the first quftt tor the actual receipt* Horn customs, in-
ternal duties, direct tax, lamKand all other soiuee*, ex-
cluding Joans and including the balance liom last year of
$13,043,5-16   $37,20*3,5:29 02

payment of principal of public debt during
the vear, of  95.212,450 14
Making an aggregate, for all purposes, of. .988,558,777 62
It is necessary to observe, how-
ever, that in the present state of the
law the estimates of the Departments
always largely exceed expenditures.
The law forbids the transfer of any
part of an appropriation for one ob-
ject or class of objects to another.
Consequently, when any appropri-
ation happens to be exhausted, ex-
penditures for the object of it, how-
ever important, must be arrested
until a further appropriation can be
had. Such an occurrence during the
recess of Congress might occasion
great public inconvenience and in-
jury. Hence it has become usual
'to make every estimate largo enough
to cover all possible requirements
under it tiil a session of Congress
shall afford an opportunity of pro-
viding for any deficiencies which
may thereafter occur. Hence there
is always a large balance of unex-
pended appropriations at the end of
every fiscal year, which, after two
years from the making of them, are
carried to the credit of what is called
the surplus fund.
It may be safely estimated, therefore, that,
of the appiupiMtioiiis made and asked tor,
thoie will remain unexpended on the 30th
Jane, lc't)3, and should, ot course, be de-
ducted tioiu the appaient aggiegate of
expenditures, not lubs tlmii    200,000,000 00

rent year by the action of Congress $376,919,517 66
The estimates for the fiscal year 3864, com-
mencing on the 1st day of July next, and ending
on the 30th day of June, 1864, must, in the pres-
ent circumstances of the country, be in great part
conjectural. The estimates of expenditureshave
been framed by the several Departments on the
supposition of the continuance of tho war—a sup-
position which, though very properly assumed as
the basin of estimates intended to cover nil con-
tingencies, is not, it may be confidently hoped,
destined to be realized. The estimates of receipts
are based upon the operations of recently enacted
laws, the working of which cannot be accurately
foreseen.
The estimates of expenditures aie as follows:
For the oivil li^t. including foreign intercourse and miscel-
laneous expenses, other than on account of the public
debt  $25,081,510 08

tinuance of the war, be stated as follows:

A tabular statement is submitted with this re-
port, and as part of it, exhibiting clearly the de-
tails of the receipts and expenditures of the finan-
cial years 1862, 1863, and 1864.
Another table is also submitted, in which may
be seen of what particulars the existing debt con-
sists, in what years it "was contracted, and when
and in what amounts it will become due. s
The other tables required by law also accom-
pany this report.
In order to the formation of sound opinions as
to the measures required for meeting the demands
disclosed by the estimates and yet unprovided for,
it may be useful to review,briefly, in connection
with their actual and probable results, the meas-
ures already recommended and adopted, or yet
under legislative consideration.
With a view to the necessary provision for the
expenditures then anticipated, the Secretary pro-
posed to Congress,at its last session, such meas-
ures as seemed to him best adapted to the attain-
ment of that object. These were (1st) an increase
of duties on various imports; (2nd) an increase
of the direct tax; (3d) the levying of internal du-
ties; (4th) a limited emission of United States
notes, convertible into coin; (5th) the negotiation
of loans, facilitated by the organization of bank-
ing associations, whose circulation should con-
sist only of notes uniform in character, furnished
by the Government, and secured, as to converti-
bility into coin, by United States bonds deposited
in the Treasury.
At the time these recommendations were sub-
mitted, the banks had not suspended specie pay-
ments, and there was reason to believe that econ-
omized expenditure and decisive military action
would secure the means required for the suppres-
sion of the rebellion without serious sacrifices on
the part of the Government, and without resort to
any other currency than that of coin and equiva-
lent notes.
Unexpected military delays, however, increased
expenditures, diminished confidence in public
securities, and made it impossible for the uanks
and capitalists, who had taken the previous loans,
to dispose of the bonds held by them except at
ruinous loss, and impossible for the Government
to negotiate new loans of coin except at like or
greater loss.
These conditions made a suspension of specie
payments inevitable. The banks of New York
suspended on the 30th of December, 1863. Their
example was followed by most of the banks
throughout the country, and the Government
yielded to the same necessity in respect to the
United States notes then in circulation.
These changed circumstances required a change
of measures. The expenditures had already
reached an average of nearly $3,250,000 each sec-
ular day; while the revenue from all sources hardly
exceeded one tenth of that sum. It was necessary,
therefore, to raise by loans in some form about
$30,000,000 a month, or $60,000,000 every sixty
days.
Careful inquiries satisfied the Secretary that the
