The troops will cross the river at Bellaire. It would be well to have a guard at the crossing, and also to close, all drinking saloons at the principal stations. You will be duly advised when the trains start.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Detained by firing of Nolen Bridge by guerrillas; fire extinguished by country people on road. Hands leave here for headquarters by special train as soon as it can be made ready. No regular train south this morning. No reliable information as to condition of affairs. You have probably later and more authentic information than I find here.
