HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Washington, March 3, 1862.

Brigadier General A. POTTER, Provost-Marshal-General.

GENERAL: * * * Concerning Joseph Widmeyer, arrested in Morgan County, Va., by order of General Banks of February 17, 1862, the commanding general directs that he be held in custody until the lines of our forces are so far advanced as to render it impossible for him to do harm in any way.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

HEADQUARTERS, Baltimore, March 4, 1862.

Honorable GEORGE H. PENDLETON, Member of Congress.

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, with one from Mrs. Broadstreet, &c. I am very sorry to inform you that her case is not within the rules I have adopted. She desires to go and return, whereas passes are given to women and children whose husbands, parents or means are in the South and who intend to remain there. A more extended indulgence wold lead to continual crossing and recrossing our military lines and would be entirely incompatible with the public interests.

While on the subject allow me to mention that Mrs. Semmes, the wife of the commander of the privateer Sumter, is in Cincinnati with her children. Her position is a very unpleasant one in many respects and she is anxious to go South. Should she not be allowed to go?
