Now, Mr. Speaker, I come to consider the
question how these enhanced prices affect the
firmer and the laborer throughout the country.
What is the consequence ot' the duplication
of the taxes as affecting these classes of the
community? Railroad iron, locomotive iron,
railway bars, and various other manufactures
of iron entering into the consumption of the
country, have been increased in price by duties
levied upon iion in various forms; not only the
duty upon pig iion, hut the duty on refined iron
and on iron in all its various forms. One duty
after another ha& been added, one tax has been
pih'd upon another, until the price of iron,
when it comes, into use by the farmer and the
laborer, for them away off in the West, is very
largely increased. The farmer is affected by
the increased cost of building railroads, by
the increased costof constructing locomotives,
by the increased charges for thrashing ma-
chines, mowing machines, and all the various
tools into which iron enters needed by him to
carry on his daily pursuits.
How are the facts with reference to cotton
and woolen goods? Nearly every article of
common wear has been increased in price to
the extent of about one hundred per cent. I
know that there is a variation in the rate of
increase 5 some of these articles are not so
high as others ; but we are to consider what is
the average increased price of the various arti-
cles entering into general consumption—salt,
iron, tools, clothing—the articles worn by the
farmer or required by him for the use of his
wife and daughters, the clothing of the laborer.
AH these things used by the people of the
country are largely enhanced in price.
But the farmer is oppressed in another direc-
tion. The increased cost of railroad iron
and of locomotive construction increases the
prices of transportation, and thus depreciates
the profit, which the iarmer ought to receive
from his farm on the products which he sends
to market. The increased cost of transporta-
tion causes an additional tax upon every bushel
of wheat and every pound of beef which he
Bends to maket; it reduces the profit upon the
beeves and hogs which he transports, or the
beef and pork which he sends to the markets
of the East and the West.
I am told that the laborer and the farmer
cannot be oppressed, because of the increased
wages received by them. I am told that the
man who with his own hands raises a crop and
sends it to market to earn a support for his
wife and children is not oppressed by the
various forms of direct and indirect taxation,
because the value of his labor is increased.
Let us examine this question by-the light of
facts. We will look at two different extremes
of the Union with reference to this matter.
I have here an extract from a very exhaust-
ive and able report made by Colonel Henry
K. .Oliver, chief of the bureau of statistics of
Massachusetts, to the senate of Massachusetts
early in 1870. This genlleman investigated
this whole subject, getting his facts from the
laborer, from the employer and employed, from
the citizen at large throughout the State of
Massachusetts. The results are embodied in
his report, some extract? from which I ask
the Clerk to read, being from pages 174, 407,
and 410 of the report.
The Clerk read as follows:
"Average to a family, number of persons, 4 4-10:
average expense of family. $701 20; average earn-
ings per family, $083 59. The following interesting
tabic shows the comparative day wages for 1861 and
1859 in different parts of the State:

"Other tables given show the following statistics:
"Employes in mechanical establishments, total
numb-r, 8.104; can neither read nor write, 404;
cliildren,352; attending school, 191._ Manufacturing
establishments, employes number 17.495; can neither
read nor write, 3,065; children, 1,507, ot whom 1.003
attend school. A "company " in Chicopec employs
1,600persons, of whom 885 can neither read nor write.
In respect to workmen owning real estate, as a result
of their savings, twenty-five such owners responded
to inquiries, ot whom sixteen arc Americans, eight
English, and on« Scotch. Deducting three proper-
ties not properly belonging to this class, there rem am
& 18.497. paid ior by the wage-labor of twenty-two
men, of the average age of forty-fivo years, working
in their present employment an aveiage of twenty-
two and three quarter years, each thus saving, in
that time, $840 77. equal to an annual saving irom
wage-labor ot $36 96 cach. . ,
"A visit to the homes of low-paid laborers is de-
scribed, showing their condition in rickety tenement
houses. One picture given of these homes is a fair
sample of the others:
" We next passed into Sf one s yard, on Cross street,
between Nos. 100 and 102 Hanover street. A three-
foot passaee-wny led into the yard, thirty-two by
twelve feet, wherein lived fourteen fannies. /here
was one privy, too horrible to be described, for the
whole tenantry. Some small places partitioned oil
in the yard, and intended for fue , were covered
with human excrement. The buildings wore three
stories high, wretched tumble-downs, and not fit ior
cntllo. The specimen room we visited was iourteen
by fourteen fe et,and seven-teet posts,occupied by tour
persons, one in bed and sick. The floor was perfor-
ated by rat-holes, and patched up by mpounngs of
anthracite ashes. This room yielded a rentage of
fcl 75 a week, in advance. G-oirig, then, lip a dark,
winding, and viekety stair-way wo eame to a room
occupied by a Mrs. R. She stood at a tub washing.
In the room was a bedstead, a table, tin chairs,
and a stove. Everything denoted the lowest st iRe
of poverty. The officer attending us said that ho
once found here a family starving. Mrs. R. appeared
cleanly and induslrio us, but thorough lyd ishea i tened.
In less than a week from our visit sho was stabbed
and killed in a quarrel with a neighbor about tint
loan of fivo conts."
Mr. ASPBR. Mr. Speaker, the last item
read is, ot' course, an extreme case, and we
are not to judge of the condition of the laborer
by that single extract. But the table, which
exhibits the average price of labor, shows that
the increase in the rate of wages, taking the
various occupations together, does not exceed
fif'tv per cent, between 1860 and 3809.
Now, let us go to the extreme West. Take
my own State of Missouri. I have here tables
prepared by Mr. Young, at the Bureau of Stat-
istics, in the Treasury Department, which have
been compiled from various sources, showing
the prices of labor in 1860 and 1869. In 1800,
from all the information which could be gath-
ered, the price of laborin Missouri, with board,
was eighty-one cents per day, and, in 1869,
SI 26 per day; and, in 1860. without board,
$1 12 per day ; and, in 1869, $1 65 per day. It
runs so through the whole list of labor, from
the lowest to the highest order of skill in the
State.
There, sir, in Missoiui, where we may pre-
sume labor to be scarce, wV.ere the laborer is in
demand, there we find, according to the tables
which have been carefully prepared by the
Bureau of Stalistics, that the price of labor has
been increasing only at the rate of fifty per
cent. That same rate will apply to the in-
crease of the price of labor all over the coun-
try. How, then, is the laborer benefited by
the increased amount he receives for his labor
per month, week, or day. when everything he
consumes has been increased in price one
hundred per cent.? I should like to know
how the laborer is benefited by an increased
price for his labor, fifiy per cent, less than
the increased price of living'/
Look the whole country over and see what
has been done, and what is now being done.
Look at the strikes of the St. Crispins, in New
York and in New England. Look at the
strikes in Pennsylvania and all over the land.
Laborers are rising here, ibete, and every-
where, because of the oppression which rests
upon them so heavily, because of the high price
of every article which enters into the con-
sumption of their families. That, is the history
of the whole country. And the farmers all
over the West are complaining. They say that
to-day they are losing, that, they do not earn as
much as it costs to run their farms. They say
that farming is absolutely a losing business with
them. Complaints of hard Limes, taxation,
and oppression come from every section.
Hence it is that the cry comes up from all
over the country for relief. Js this condition
of things to be looked upon by the statesman
with complacency?
Now, Mr. Speaker, what can be done in refer-
ence to this matter? 1 propose, in the first
place, to reduce the amount we are to raise
from impost duties. We have, by the bill
passed here at the last session, reduced the
collection of the interna! revenue to some four
articles—spii its, tobacco, stamps, and incomes.
It is estimated by the Secretary ol the Treasury
that under that bill, for the coming year, the
amount of revenue which may he expected
from those different, items will be $126,418,000.
He also estimates that we will receive S.S.CU0.-
000 from the sale of the public lands, and
from miscellaneous sources $16,000 000 : mak-
ing from those different sources—those three
sources alone—$145,418,009. The residue re-
quired must be supplied by imposts. I believe
