Nashville, Tenn., August 22, 1865.

Major General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report, in accordance with General Orders, Numbers 39, Quartermaster-General's Office, dated Washington, D. C., July 1, 1865, as follows:

During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1865, I was on duty in New York City until October 31, as purchasing and disbursing quartermaster. On being relieved from duty there I was directed by orders from the Adjutant-General's Office to report to the commanding general and chief quartermaster Military Division of the Mississippi for assignment. I proceeded as far as Calhoun, Ga., to report to General Sherman, who had just started on his march to Savannah. Communication being cut off, I reported to Major-General Thomas, commanding in General Sherman's absence. On the 10th of December I was directed to relieve Colonel J. C. Crane, and Captain A. R. Eddy of all duties
