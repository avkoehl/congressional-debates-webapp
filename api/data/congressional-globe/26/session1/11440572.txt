Thus was a debt incurred to foreign merchants
of over one hundred and thirty-five millions, stirnt
lated by the expansion of ihe currency.   The saro
effect was visible in the sales of the public lands,
which rose fro ■a $3,967,681, in 1833, to$Q4,b77,-
179 • in 1836, the year when the expansion was at
its acme, and the country bore the appearance of
the greatest prosperity, but which was delusive,
and, in truth, portended a sudden reaction.
3. Another cause of the rise of price?, and par-
ticularly of agricultural products and farms, was
the diminutirn of the supply in proportion to the
demand. This was produced by two minor causes
operating to effect it.
3.  The first and most prominent, wai the ab-
straction of labor fron  the business of production.
Daring this period of unbridled enterprise and ex-
travagance, the States, as well as corporations, em-
barked largely in schemes of internal improve-
ments, in building railroads and canals. They
had borrowed immense sums from Europe, to carry
on the stupenlous projects, which they had com-
menced. They employed a vast number of laborers,
who, by that change of pursuit, became consumer?,
instead of being producers, thus increasing the de-
mand in proportion to the supply; which was much
less than it would have been, if it had not been
for the abstraction of that amount of labor from ihe
business of pioduction which was empleyed on
public works.
4.  Another cause, sir, was the unfruitful seasons
of 1835, '36, and '37, which also tended to dimi-
nish the proportion of the supply <o the demand.
The eflect of all this was, to inctea<e the prices of
all agricultural products, and of farms, and also of
the wages of labor, which were affected by like
causes.
Another striking f ffect was visible in the impor-
tation of foreign grain. Instead of exporting large
quantities, as we had heretofore done, the country
did not raise enough for its own consumption. I
exhibit, sir, a table, which shows the amount of
grain imported from 1835 to 1839:

Thus, Mr. Chairman, it appears that, during the
first period of fife years, which was before the
causes 1 have assigned for high prices were felt in
their full force, but the small amount of 5,035
bushels of wheat was imported, for which $5,147
were paid; and 6,063 bushels of oats, for which
#1,658 were paid. During the second period of
Jive years, the period during which those causes of
high prices were felt in their full force, 5,611,335
bushels of whea , for which were paid $5,764 972;
and 282,761 bushels of oats, for which §71,807. In

like the excess of importations, the amount was greatest in
1MB; much less in 1637, very low in 1838, but in 1839 they
mired—the conseqieaee of the expansion in 1833.
1839, ih"se causes had ceased to operate, and but a
small amount of foreign grain was imported.
It is unnecetsary for me, Mr. Chair Jian, to de-
pict the scenes of enterprise run mad, and the spirit
of wild and gambling speculation which followed,
for Ihe picture is familiar to every mind. The
bubble extended in size, uulil it reached i's most
attenuated limits of expansion, when it burst.
Then followed the revuls'oa and panic of 1837,
usheied in by ihe grand explosion of the banks,
which had been the authors of all this sp'endid pa-
geant of empty prosperity, and all the real distress,
desolation, and ruin, which followed.
I will, Mr. Chairman, sta'.ebritfly the immedi-
ate cause which led to this revu'sion.
1. The first and chief cause was the contraction
of the f iiculat:on, and of banking facilities. On
the first of Jannaiy, 1838, the amaunt of the loans
and discounts of all the banks of the United Sta'es,
was #485,631,687 ; and of their circulation,
$116,138,910; thus showing a contraction of dis-
counts to the amount of $39,484.015, which affected
individuals directly; and $33,046,930 in the c rcu-
lation,which affected the community generally; mak-
ing an aggregate curtailment of banking " accom-
modations" and "facilities" of more than SE-
VENTY-FOUR MILLIONS. This, with the
alarm created by the explosion of the banks, caused
the distresses of 1837.
But the spirit of infatuated speculation had not
quite died away. The country had not quite reco-
vered frcm its state of inebriation and delusion.
It suffered a partial relapse, as will be seen by the
fads I shall eih.bit. In 1838 anoiher parti.il ex-
pansion of the currency took place, and the usual
phenomena were immediately visible, viz: a revival
of business, a renewed spirit of specu'aúon, overim-
portation, and overtrading. On ihe 1st of January,
1839, the amount of loans of all the banks in the
United States was $492,278,015; circulation $135,-
170,995; being an increase of loans over the pre-
ceding year of $16,646,331, and of circulation,
which affected the country most, of $19,032,065;
sgsrrgate increase of loans and circulation,
$35,678,396. This increase of the stimulus of
trade and speculation was at once visible in the bu-
siness of the country, and particularly in the ex-
cess of the imports ever the exports. In 1838, the
year following the revulsion of 1837, and the year
of repose, the exports were $108,436,616, imports
$113,717,404; which was not a greater excess than
a sound and healthy trade would warrant. In
1839, after the partial expansion of the circulation,
and of other bank facilities in 1838, the expoits
were $121,023,410, imports $162,092,132; exhibit-
itg ihe enormous excess of imports over exports of
$41,068,722 in one year. Cause and effect were
never more closely connected.
I will now, Mr. Chairman, briefly notice the
causes that led to the fall of prices which has taken
place during the last six months. As to the distress
which is said to prevail by Federal orators and Fe-
deral newspapers, there is nothing in it. There is,
in fact, but Mile, if any real distress in the couniry,
is I shall prove presently. The causes which have
induced a fall ef prices, are—
1.  A contraction of the currency. On the 1st of
January, 1837, the amount of circulation was
$149,185,840. On the 1st of January, 1840, -t was
$106,968,572; showing a reduction of $42,217,268,
since January 1, 1837, and $28,109,433, since Ja-
nuary 1, 1839. Such a sudden dinrnution of the
measure of value, is alone sufficient to account, in
a groat degree, for Ihe great reduction of prices
which followed.
2.  Another cause was ihe diminution of the de-
mand in proportion to the fupply. This was pro-
duced by two sub-causes, viz: the favorable season?;
and the return of the labor abstracted by works of
internal improvement, and engaged in speculation,
to Ihe business of production. The public works
have generally been suspended, and the va^t num-
ber of laborers employed upon them, have returned
to the cultivation of the earth. Instead of being
consumers, they have become producers, and the
consequence is, a vast increase of agricultural pro-
ducts in proportion to the demand for them. A fall
in the prices of agricultural products, of wheat, of
corn, of pork, of beef, of every thing produced by
the farmer or planter, was therefore inevitable.
Note—It is proper here to remark, that the article of tot'on
is not so much affected by the causes operating upon price 
here, as in England, in wliicn country most of it is consumed

The Bank of England, by the exercise oí its power, in refuting'
its accommodations to the American houses in London, throu'5
which the business of the American exporter was dune, rauswi
the great fall of the prices of American cotton in 1S36. These
things are too fresh in the minds of American planters to require
further proof.
The table of prices in Ihe Boston market is a complete iher-
mometer, indicating unerringly the effects of an expansion of
the currency, and the operation of other causes tending to raise
and depress prices. The expansions and contractions ot die
currency, and the rise and fall of piices consequent upon them
show a most perfect connection ot cause and effect.               '
Mr. Chairman, the intelligent laimer.i of this
country must perceive the tiu:h of the pt stticnsl
have assumed, and they will be convinced that ihe
Administration is r.ot responsible fcr the fall of
prices which has taken place wi'hin the las-t nice
months. I appeal, sir, t > the good sense of ihatnu.
morous and powerful class of my fellow-citizen.*,
and I ask them, if the Government could control
the banks, and compel them to issue the.r paper in
greater abundance? Would it have been the best po-
licy, if it could have doce it? Have those arrogant
and lawless institutions, even regarded the authori-
ty of law and the welfare of the community, when
it has been their interest to trample upun boih?
Let their recent conduct answer. Could the Go-
vernment control Divine Prov,dence in ihe d.spm-
sation of its blessirgs and beneficenct? Cou!d it
shut out the vivifying sun-light of heaven? Could
it arrest the refreshing shower in i s descent upon
the earth? Could it forbid man to labor and till the
earth, and could it prevent the soil from giving
forth its abundance? Through the audarious and
dating wickedness of the batiks, the circulating me-
dium, which is the measure of value, has been cut
shor*. Through the benevolence of the Father of
all, the seasons have been congenial, and the earth
has yielded her fruits in profusion. These are the
prime causes of the fall of prices. Is the Govern-
ment to be blamed for all this? I put it, sir, to the
hearts and consciences of the honest and intelli-
gent yeomanry of this country. I would
not, deceive them in this matter if 1 could,
for all my sympathies are wih them. I was
one of them once. I have toilsd in the field w.th
my own hands, at.d have performed all tKe onrious
labor* ol the hu^lancrr.an. I have mingled with
that class from early lile. I know their wcrih,
their love of truth, ih:ir hoce.-ty, and integrity of
character; and believe me, Mr. Chairman, when
that class of our fellow-cit.zens render their verdict
upon the great question now at issue Lefore ibeio,
it will be just and correct. I, for one, fear not the
result.
I ¡hall now, Mr. Chairman,.proceed to demon-
strate, so far as they are tusceptible of dtmonstia-
tion by facts and figures, the causes of the fluc-
tuations which take place in the wages of labor.
It will be recollected, sir, that the doctr.ne cow
advanced by the Federal party, and particularly by
the honorable gentleman before alluded to, [Mr.
Divis] is, that a paper currency tends to elevate
the wages cf lafcor, and, therefore, is the best cur-
rency lor the woikingman; and that a metallic cur-
tency tends to dimiuish the wages of labor, and,
therefore, is hostile tt> the interests of the working-
man.                                                 ,
The professors of this school of political econo-
mists take the fact, that ihe wages of labor are
high in this counüy, which, in their phrase, is a
'•paper money Gov* rnment," and low m the coun-
tries of Europe, which they assume are "hard money
de potisms;" and one of the corollaries is, that paper
money, manufactured by man, is the friend ot free-
dom; and hard money, made Jby God himseli espe-
cially for the me of man, as ths true meaMtre of
value throughout the world, ;s the friend of despo-
tism! They, therefore, contend that Ihe Indepen-
dent Treasury, which will have a tendency to rx¡alie
the banks re.-ume specie pa}me.<ts, and rendar th«
currency which they furnish sound and s-tab^e, (so
far as paper rr mixed currency can be,) and, to
some extent, reduce Ihe mnunal prices of prererty
from inflated to sound prices, is hostile to the inte-
