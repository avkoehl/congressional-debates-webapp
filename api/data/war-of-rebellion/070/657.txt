MAX WEBER,

Brigadier-General.

BUCKHANNON, W. VA., June 20, 1864.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY,

Cumberland:

Two deserters just came to Beverly who left Breckinridge's command east of the Blue Ridge on the 12th. Breckinridge was marching toward Lynchburg or Charlottesville. Rumors were that Pickett was coming to Lynchburg. Our cavalry were fifteen miles from Charlottesville tearing up railroad. Four thousand rebel cavalry were in Hunter's rear. Hunter was making toward Lynchburg. I go to Clarksburg to-day.

N. WILKINSON.

Colonel.

CITY POINT, VA., June 21, 1864.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

The only word I would send General Hunter would be verbal, and simply to let him know where we are, and tell him to save his army in the way he thinks best, either by getting back into his own department or by joining us. If we had the enemy driven north of the Appomattox I think he would have no difficulty in joining us by taking a wide sweep south.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
