HEADQUARTERS HUMBOLDT MILITARY DISTRICT,Fort Gaston, Cal., February 16, 1864.

Captain E. B. GIBBS,

Second Infantry Califirnia Vols., Commanding Camp Curtis:

CAPTAIN: Your letter of the 8th instant, with the accompanying petition of the people of Arcata, is received and contents noted. By a most unaccountable mistake it did not come to hand until after the mail had left last Friday. The state of excitement you describe I can very readily understand, and there is no doubt some couse of alarm. The Indians have a hatred toward the settlements on the coasts, particularly Arcata, and the greatest vigilance is required to guard against them. It was my opinion that the force at Camp Curtis would be sufficient during the winter, though there has been so little storm of late that the Indians move about at pleasure. For amonth past I have wished that your company was all at Camp Curtis to be stationed as you deem necessary for the protection of Arcata and adjacent settlements, but have not been able as yet to replace the detachment at Camp Gilmore. Constant call is made upon me for troops from every quarter and to keep up the scouting parties that are now in the field. It seems almost impossible to spare any men from here just now for the coast. All I can do at this moment is to increase yourorce by twelve men from Company D, First Battalion Mountaineers, California Volunteers, as per copy of order inclosed. It gives me pleasure to state that the prompt steps you have taken for the defense of Arcata meet my hearty approbation. Please advise me by return escort if any indications have been discovered of the presence of Indians in the vicinity of Camp Curtis.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. G. WHIPPLE,

Lieutenant Colonel First Battalion Mountaineers, California Vols., Commanding Humboldt Military District.
HEADQUARTERS HUMBOLDT MILITARY DISTRICT,Fort Gaston, Cal., February 16, 186 HALE,

First Battalion Muntaineers, California Vols., Orleans Bar:

LIEUTENANT: Your letter of yesterday has been received and contents noted. It is my desire to increase the force at Orleans Bar when practicable. The gentlemen wh were here from that place and who returned with you were of the opinion that ten men wuld be sufficient for the protection of that town as long as the Klamath Indians remained friendly. There will be a larger force stationed there, however, when the absolute necessity therof is apparent and the troops can possibly be spared. Other men will be sent fromtime to time to take the place of portions of your detachment when it can be done without interfering with active oprations, but you will not grant leaves of absence to any of your command. You will be supplied with rations for your detachment from this post. If you can, however, purchase fresh beef there at the price stated, there is no objection to your doing so to the amount allowed by the Army Regulations.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. G. WHIPPLE,

Lieutenant Colonel First Battalion Mountaineers, California Vols., Commanding Humboldt Military District.
