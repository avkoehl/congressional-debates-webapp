Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, First Cavalry Division:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to report that the scout of 100 men sent out from this brigade December 9, 1864, has just returned. The officer in charge reports that he sent out parties as directed beyond Fisher's Hill, who saw nothing of the enemy either time. Heard that the enemy's cavalry pickets were at Edenburg and their infantry force at New Market.

Very respectfully,

Commanding Brigade.

Imboden has gone to Culpeper with Eighteenth and Sixty-second Virginia Regiments. Johnsons commands Rodes' old division. The Luray Valley is perfectly desolate, and there is nothing in it but scouting parties.
