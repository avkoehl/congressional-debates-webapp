oppo«ition to the decision of the Chair, and Mr.
BROWN, of New York, in support of it
Mr WILDEasked whethei, before the decision
of the House on the appeal, it would be in order
to move a call of the House.
The SPEAKER teplied that it would not be in
order
Mr WÍLDC then demanded the yeas and nays
on the appeal, and they weie ordered
Mr CHILTON íemarked that there was noth
mg in the rule of the House that foibade a call of
the House, and hoped that upon a great question
like this, the fundamental rights of their constitu-
ents to give, through their repiesenta'ives,avote,
would be respected
Mr BYNCJM said he did not rise so much to
enter the discussion of ihe parliamentary usages of
the House, in relation to the subject under debate,
as to reply to the remarks of his honoiable friend
from Virginia, [Mr Giiolsuv,] and uhegentleman
fiom Georgia, who had just taken his seat Mr
B said he had heretofoie invariably voted against
the call of the previous question His object had
been to allow the fullest latitude to a free discis-
sion of the subject then before them, which had
been carried on upwards of two months, without
interruption, and which he thought, in all con-
science, a reasonable length of time for the discus-
sion of one subject But the honorable«gentleman
from Virgiria had said, or insinuated, that the
House was about to use the brutal force of num-
bers to puta stop to the debate This he denied,
and contended that he had every disposition to
extend to every gentleman on the flooi an oppor-
tunity to address the House, but that he thought
such was the natuieof this protracted debate, and
the circumstances growing out of it, that the inter-
est of the country at large required that it should
be terminated ínsomefoim orother, that hundreds
and hundreds of thousands of dollars of the peo
pie's money had been spent in this protracted dis
cussion, without ti e least benefit, in his judgment,
bemgaffoided to the nation, he could not, therefore,
upon giounds of policy, feel himself justified in
voting in favor of a continuation of so fiuitless a
discussion Mr B said that the gentleman from
Geoigia, [Mi Clayton,] had stated, that he
thought it a vei y hard case that a call of the House
should not be made, in ordei to allow gentlemen
who were absent an oppoitumty of voting Mr
B said, he could not recognize the principle of
having a call of the House on every occasion to
get members in to vote He thought it rather their
duty to be in then seats, and that they should be
excused only for siuknessorunavoidableabsence,
for which he had i o doubt they always would be
excused both by the Blouse and theirconst tuents,
to whom they weiemore immediately responsible
He, therefore, thought there was little weight in
the argument of the gentleman *iom Georgia in
relation to the hardness of the cases of those who
were absent Gentlemen had complained, said
Mi B , of the majority's deteiminalion to bring
this debate to a close—he thought tr's comprint
wholly unfounded Wl o (he asked) wss most
responsible foi this protiacted discussion5 Who
would be censured fortne evil consequences which
had, and would continue to grow out of it> The
friends of the Administiation, no doubt Yes,sii,
the veiy party trot now is onposed to the teimina-
tion of this already too piotracted and perplexing
question, will be the first to cry out, in voices of
bitterest censuie, asainst the majority in favor of
the Administiation hiving suffeied so much time
of the House to be consumed it such enoimous
expense to the country in idl and piofitlessdeoa'e,
that they had the power to rut a stop to ¡t when
ever they might have (nought piopei He thought
couitesy at this time lequiied immediateaction on
the subject Indeed, gentlemen of the opposuicn
had so declaied themselves, ajun ar d i°;ain
Mi B was proceeding to show that the piesent
excitement in tliecountiy was owing more to the
inceititude of the action of the House on the sub-
ject than to the simple act of the iemoval of tne
deposites, when the debate w<is prrested by the
SpeaKer'-, informing Mr B that the ments of the
question could not be gone into on the motion foi
a call of the House
Mr WILLIAMS believed that a call ot the
House was at all times in oidei, as it was prelum
nary to, and necess-iy to, all othei questions   He
would move a call of the House before the question
on the appeal was taken
The SPEAKER decided that tms motion was
not in order
Mr WAYNE considered, as the House was
not in possession of the motion for the previous
question, the call of the House was then in oidei
Mr REED said that the veiy seconding of the
question vas the derision of the House, and which
must ultimately affect the question He hoped
that the decision made by the Speaker wou d be
revei sed                                                                v
Mr BURGES deemed the continuance of the
present question in debate as one of the most im-
portant questions that ever had been presented.
The SPEAKER called to order
Mr B continued and said, he desired therefore
to have a full expression of the repieseruative
voice, that the fetters of tyranny should not be
riveted so as that on this great question hereafter
no man could say in excuse that he was not heie
to vote upon it
Mi BEARDSLEY said he would not debate
the merits of the question, but he meant to call
the attention of the House to what had been its
practice on former occasions, and in doing so he
could not help adverting to the former vote given
by the honoiable member from Rhode Island, two
years ago, upon an occasion which that honorable
member must well remember Notwithstanding
the horror which he now expresses against the call
for the previous question, he had twice concuired
in such a call on one and the same day, to cany
through the question of rechartenng the Bank of
the United States Then there was not a word
from him as to tyranny If the present call was
tyranny, what, heasked, was the conductof those
acting then with him'
The SPEAKER rose to order
After a few remaiks from Mr BURGES and
Mr  BEARDSLEY,
Mr ADAMS said it was his intention to have
asked the member from Pennsylvania [Mr Muhl
emserg] to withdraw his motion foi the previous
question, that he might have addiessed a few re-
maiks, not on the merits of this question, but to
show that the report of the Secretary ought not to
be sent to the Committee of Ways and Means
without the instructions moved by the member
from South Carolina, [Mr McDurFic,] but as a
similar favor had been refused to another member,
he could not, with propriety, now make the re-
quest He hoped, however, hereafter to have an
opportunity of addressing the House on the ab-
stract question, and feeling, then, unwilling to
waste the time of the House, and at the same time
desirous to avoid a decision upon what he feared
would be a most pernicious precedent, he would
withdraw his appeal fiom the decision of the
Chair
Mi POSTER, however, renewed the appeal,
ai d the question theieon being stated—
Mr HARDIN remarked, he íegretted to d ffer
with his friends, but he must say that the call of
the House was not in order after the previous
question was moved
The House sustained the decision of the Chair
by the following vote—115 to 112
The question was then tiVen or the call for the
previous question, and the call was seconded by
the House, bv a vote of—115 to 109
Mr CHILTON then movedacallofthe House

Mr BURGES moved that ihe House do now
idjCurn and thereupon asked the yeas and nays,
