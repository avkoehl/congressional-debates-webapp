GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

December 2, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Colonel Potter has been assigned to the command of a brigade in the Eighteenth Corps, and I would not like to spare him if you do not object to the assignment.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

CITY POINT, VA., December 2, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

I understand that Pollard, the Southern historian, is at Fortress Monroe, paroled and going about the wharf and elsewhere with freedom. The imprudence of many of our officers in telling all they know to every one makes this objectionable, particularly if he is to be exchanged. I would suggest close confinement for him until the time comes for exchanging. I would also suggest that if he is exchanged, Richardson and Browne, two correspondents that were captured running the Vicksburg blockade, be demanded for him.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I will attend to the matter of Mr. Pollard. I did not know that he was at large. He is not to be exchanged, unless Richardson and Browne are given up.

Major-General MEADE:

Large numbers of the colored division, Ninth Corps, were on detached or detailed duty in that corps, and have not been sent with their regiments. I took special pains to have all the detailed men of the Provisional Brigade sent to you. Please order all the men on duty in your army belonging to the Army of the James sent here, especially of the colored division. Your will have to see to it that the order is enforced, as it is difficult to get detailed men always.
