Where is that musketry firing? Is it in your front, Wright's or Burnside's?

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The musketry firing has been along the Ny River, in front of General Wright; not much of it. I am moving Ayers, with 1,000 men, out to take this force of the enemy on their left flank.

It is General Wright. It might as well be stomped. My men will advance if it does. I think the enemy has retired from the house.

I think the enemy has left the house. My infantry will move on when your batteries stop. Move your infantry, too.
