General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Richmond:

There is nothing now threatening Roddey's front in the valley of the Tennessee, and the situation of affairs requires that he should be thrown on the Selma and Blue Mountain railroad to protect Talladega and Selma. Please answer.

Lieutenant-General.

General POLK:

The withdrawal from Alabama of Jackson's cavalry, which was not anticipated, has caused the necessity you report. Instructions have been given General S. D. Lee to afford all the protection possible with force ow in his department.

Respectfully returned.

General Clanton's brigade never reached this army. One regiment came and the general represented that the rest, then dispersed, was to assemble at Blue Mountain. He further represented that he could do good service in putting down plundering, arresting deserters, and perhaps getting in rear of the enemy. He was ordered to take his small regiment from the army and attempt it. No return of the army was made while that regiment was in it. General C[lanton[has not since been heard from.

[J. E. JOHNSTON.]
