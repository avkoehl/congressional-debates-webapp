such laws, how can a law be defended which embraces then
and bankers alone?
"How do the President s suggestions csnform to hi? notions ,
of the Constitution? The object of bankrupt law sir has nn
relation to currency It is simply to distrioute the effects of
insolvent debtors among their creditors, and 1 must sty, it
strikes me that it would be a great pen ersion of the power
conferred on Congress to exercise it upon corpnrau ns and
hankers, with the leading and primary object of lemedjmg a
depreciated paper currency
''And this appears the more extraordinary niacin ic as the
President is of opinion that the general subject of the cm rency

just meaning, is withm our province Currency say* the
Message is not Butwehavaabankruptcy powet mthel o sn

but fpr currency This, I confess, sir appears to me to be t'ie
short statement of the matter I would not do the Message
or Hs author, arty vnlentional mjust ce, nor ctea e anv aopu
rent where there was not a real mcoraisiencj bt 11 dcclaie
in all sincerity, that I cannot reconcile the proposed use of the
bankrupt power with those opinions of the Message which
respect the authority of Congress over the currency of the
country "
These are the objections wh ch the Senator from
Massachusetts takes to the Executive recommenda-
tion They are of a two-fold character first, to
the constitutional power of Congress to pass a
bankrupt law, confined to moneyed corporations
and bankers, and with a view to operate upon the
paper currency, secondly, to he consistency of the
President m having made such a recommendation
I take up the second of these objections first,
because it creates a prejudice againbt the whole
recommendation of the President The imputa-
tion of inconsistency creates a prejudice, and it is
necessary to remove that prejudice before the re-
commendation can be fairly considered The in-
consistency imputed, lies in the supposed disclaimer
of the President of all federal authority over the
currency, and then, an assumption of power to íe-
gulate that currtney, and to regulate it by an
unauthorized exercise of the pow er to pass bank-
rupt laws. This is the point of the-imputed in-
consistency It all turns upon thi« woid cur-
rency, and now, what currency do s tne Scmtir
from Massachusetts mean'' Certain!) n< tit e cur-
rency of the Constitution for the Presi lent t^ es
the power to com that currency, and to regulate
its value It must be the papei currency—the
local bank notes and the shm-plaster-—which ,ire
intended, and, if so, I have to remark that the
President very explicitly disclaims both the autho-
rity, and the expediency, of having iecomse to a
national bank to regulate that species of cunency
He disclaims that instrument of regulation, and m
doing so, he stands upon the Constitution, which
disowns its existence, upon the fact, which shows
its impotenc), and upon the ground which the ¡>u
thors of the first nationil bank occupie! -nd to
"whom the regulation of currency and of exchange
was who 1) unknown as among the reasons for its
creat on These reasons are of modern concep-
tion and recent date They are an after thought
ot (he subsequent supporters ef the second national
bank The President disclaims also a power to
suppress the local banking institutions by federal
legislatit n, but he no «here disclaims the authority
to prevent their paper issues from superseding
and expelling (he hard money currency of the
Constitution On the conlrar), he claims that
power, and points to the sources of its nghtful ex-
ercise in the incidental effects of federal legislation
in favor of hard money as necessanl) improving
the condition of paper currency, and then he
points to the bankrupt power as furnishing the
direct means of checking the issues of non-
specie paying banks, and giving a remedy to
the holders of their unpaid notes This is what
the President does, and nothing can be further from
his words than a disclaimer of all authority over
the regulation of currency And here let me re-
maikupon a S) somatic error into which some
Senators incessanti) fal' they always speak of the
federal authority, and the federal duties over "the
eunency," meaning all the w hilt, not gold and sil-
ver, but bank notes and shin planters Now, sir,
I repeat, for about the thousandth time, that ihe
■word currency is not in t'ie Constituí ion, nor an?
word whatsover wh ch can mean what these speak-
ers intend by it The n arest approach to the
term which the Constitution contains is the werd
cuirent, and that is coupled w ith the word com, so
that the thing which gemlemen have constantly in
then minds, and v. hieh they use an ec, in ooal term
to express, exists no where m the Constitution, and
is not in any way known to th?t instrument, either
by expression, or intendment I think it right, on
this occasion, thus to allude to the equivocal use of
this phrase, for upon this equivocation there is
built up, n these United State , an immensity of
erroneous speaking, erroneous writing, and errone-
ous legisla ion Vast is the number of persons
who are mystified by the use of an equivocal term,
and in nothing does the rhetorician show the per-
lection of his ?rt in a higher degree, than in mak-
ing a debate turn upon one of them
Tne Senator from Massachusetts, m taking his
objections, d c!ared that he would not do intention-
al injustice to the Message or to its author, but it is
the same thing to the Message, and to the author, if
injustice hadbeen done without intention, and this I
apprehend to have been the case The Message says
nothing about confining the bankrupt law to corpo-
•ations and bankers alone, it says nothing about
excluding merchants, and traders from the opera-
tion of the law, and it proposes something else to
result from the law, besides an operation upon cur-
jency, and that something else is a remedy to the
disappointed creditors of the delinquent banks
This is his recommendation
K In the mem time it is out duty to provide all the remedies
against a depreciated patier currency which the Constitution
enables us to afford The Treasury Department on several
former occasions has suggested the propriety and lmpouance
of a uniform law concerning bankruptcies of corporations and
other bankers Through the instrumentality of such a law a
patutaiycAecAmay doubtless be imposed on the issues of paper
money, and an effectual * emedy given to the citizen in away
at once equal in all parts of the Union and fully authonzedby
the Constitution
This is the recommendation—the whole of it,
and here is no proposition to exclude merchants
and trader^, and heie is an actual proposition to
give a remedy to the injured utiyens against the
delinquent banks, which remedy would naturally
be a pro rala distribution of the effect' of the bank-
rupt institutions Here, thei is i-=iu*tice to the
Message, in not stating it as it i>, b it as it i not,
and here, also, is mjusiice to the author, in repre-
senting him as opposed to the extension of the
bankrupt hw to merchaits and traders, when the
records of this Senate bear ÜV evidence of the fact
tint he has been one of the mrst able and zealous
supporters of such a law applicable to the trading
part of the community 1 speak of the bill of 1837,
brought in by General Hayne, of South Carolina,
and earnestl) supported by the present Chief Magis-
trate, then a member of tins body It is unjust to
suppose that the present Chief Magistrate would
object to a I II which should include now those for
whom he so strenuously contended when a member
of this bod\ there is nothing m tile recommenda-
tion to de'er the friends of a general banl rupt law
ftom coming forward to include the trading class
with the banking class, on the contrary, there may
be something to encourage them A general bill
to include banks, as well as traders, might combine
more support than the bills for the latter class alone
have heretofore received Besides, if the President
had expressly recommended the exclusion of other
classes from the bill, it would have been no impedi-
ment to the action ot Congress His recommenda
tion would have been no prohibition upon their
power  They might have included what clashes
they pleased, and if they included those for which
he contended in 1897, the bill might have become
the more acceptable to him on that account
1 he Senator from Massachusetts objects to our
constitutional power to pass such a bankrupt law
as the President recommends, qualifying that re-
commendation, as he does, w nh a hm tation of the
law to bankers and banking corporations, and with a
primary view to the regulation of a paper money
curre icy I have show n that this qualification is
an error anda mistake, an 1 in doing that, I have
sufficiently answered the Scnitoi's objection, but I
choose to go furtb.tr, and tc shov not only the con
-stitutionilngh , but tie clear ex, ediency, of passing
such an act as the President íecommends, whether
merchant-, ar 1 traders sha'l be included in it or
not
The power of Congress to pass bankrupt laws
is expre^s'y s ven m our Cons ltution, and given
without !i mta ion or qualification It is the fourth
in the number of the enumerated powers, and runs
thus "Congress shall have power—to establish an
uniform rule of na'urahzation, and uniform laws
on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the
United States " This is a full and clear grant of
power Upon its face it admits of no ques'ion,
and leaves Congress at full liberty to pass any kind
of bankrupt laws they please, limited only by the
condition, that whatever laws are passed, they are
to be uniform in. their operation throughout the
United States Upon the face of our own Consti-
tution there is no question of our right to pass a
bankrupt law, limited to banks and bankers, but
the Senator from Massachusetts, (Mr Webster )
and others who have spoken on the same s de with
him, must carry us to England, and conduct us
through the labyrinth of English statute law, and
through the chaos of English judicial decisions,
to learn what this word bankruptcies, m <ur
Constitution, is intended to signify In this he,
and they, are true to the habits of the legal pio-
fession—those habits which, both in Great Britain
and our America, have become a proverbial dis-
qualification for the proper exercise of legislative
duties I know, Mr President, that it is the fate
of our lawyers and judges to have to run to British
law books to find out the meaning of the phrases
contained in our Constitution, but it is the busi-
ness of the legislator, and of the statesman, to take
a larger view—to consider the difference between
the political institutions of the two countries—to
ascend to first principles—to know the cau'es of
events—and to judge how far -what was suitable
and beneficial to one, might be prejudicial and in-
applicable to the other We stand here as legisla-
tors and statesmen, not as law)ers and judges, v>e
have a grant of power to execute, not a statute to
interpret, and our first duty is to look to that grant,
and see what it is, and our next duty is to lool
over our country, and see whether there is any
thing in it which requires the exercise of th ' gram
of power This is what our President has done,
and -what we ought to do He Ins looked into the
Constitution, and seen there an unlimited grant ot
power to pass uniform laws on the subject of bank-
ruptcies, and he has looked over the United States,
and seen what he believes to be fit subjects foi
the exercise of that power, namely about a thou-
sand banks in a state of bankruptcy, and no
State possessed of authority to act be) ond its own
limits m remedying the evils of a mischief so ^ ast
and so frightful Seeing the^e two things.—a power
to act and a subject matter requiring action—the
President has recommended the action which the
Constitution permits, and which the subject H-
quues, bat the Senator from Mas achusetts his
risen in his place, and called upon us to shift om
view, to transfer our contemplation—from the Con-
s ltution of the United States to the British statute
book—from actual bankruptcy among ourselves to
historical bankruptcy m England, and to confii e
our legislation to the characteristics of the English
model
As a general proposition, I lay it down that Con-
gress 's not coufined, like junsts and judges, to the
English statuory definitions, or the Nisi Prius, or
King's Bench construction oí the phrases known
to English legislation, and used in our Const tu ion
Such a limitation would not only narrow ns down
to a mere law)er's view of a sunject, but wou'd
limit us, in point of time, to English precedents, as
they stood at the adoption of our Constitu ion, m
the yeai 1789 I protest against this absurdity,
and contend that we arc to use our granted powers
according to the circumstances of our own coun-
tiy, and according to the genius of our rej ublican
institutions, and according to the progress of et ent ,
and the expansion of light and knowledge among
ourselves If not, and if we aie to be confined to
the " usual objects,'1'' and the " imial subjects," and
the " usual purposes" of Butish 'pgislafion at Ire
time of the adoption of our Cons ltuiion how coa d
Congress ever make a law in relation to stem-
boats or to railroad carsl both of which were un-
known to British legislation in 1789, and, therefore,
according to the idea that would send us to Eng-
land to find out the meaning of ou* Constitution,
would not fall within the limits of our legislative
authority Upon their face, the words of the Con-
stitution aie sufficient to justif)  the President's re-
