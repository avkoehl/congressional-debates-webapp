NEW CREEK, May 12, 1864.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY:

Porter reports the Alleghany pike impassable to artillery and wagons. Has no information of the enemy in his vicinity. Is on the alert.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel.

COLUMBUS, May 12, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I have five or six regiments organized and in camp more than my quota. Will you take them, or must I disband them? If you take them where shall they be assigned? Answer early, as they are crowding me.

JNO. BROUGH.

WASHINGTON CITY, May 12, 1864-10 p. m.

Governor BROUGH,

Columbus, Ohio:

I will accept all the troops you can raise. The other States will be deficient and behind time. We want every man now. The reported news from the army this evening is highly gratifying, but we have nothing official. Let us have all your regiments within the next week. They may decide the war.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

COLUMBUS, May 12, 1864.

SECRETARY OF WAR:

I have a regiment at Gallipolis ready for Charleston, W. Va. Ordnance officer there says he can arm it with Springfield rifles, and furnish ammunition, to move it at once. This will save three days in getting arms to it. Can the officer there arm the regiment?

JNO. BROUGH.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, May 12, 1864. (Received 10.30 a. m. 13th.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

You do not assign the extra regiments. Tell me where to send five regiments in addition to those heretofore assigned. Up to this morning I have sent forward two to Baltimore, two to Cumberland, three to Washington, two to Parkersburg, one to Charleston, three to New Creek, and three to Harper's Ferry, making sixteen in all. I will move five to-day if I can get transportation.

JNO. BROUGH.
