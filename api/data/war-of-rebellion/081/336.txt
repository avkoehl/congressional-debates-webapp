Brigadier General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

Your dispatches have been received and will be obeyed. The 200 sets of rail-twisters arrived last night. Those formerly sent are being used now by Wilson's division of cavalry. I had already given orders with regard to discharging vessels. You may be assured I will keep no surplus or unnecessary transportation in this river. I have established camp for unserviceable stock.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 23, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS:

We have received from the Second Corps one captain and eight men, all but one from Anderson's division (Hill's corps). The captain and four of the men were taken this a.m.; not knowing that the part of our line taken by the enemy yesterday was abandoned by them during the night they were proceeding to it and ran into our lines of skirmishers. One man is from the Fourth North Carolina Cavalry (Gordon's old brigade), General Barringer now commanding, and was taken yesterday p.m. at Reams' pump, or Station, on the Weldon railroad. He says that for some reason or other his brigade (which is much recruited) and Dearing's brigade (about which I do not know), of Georgians and others mixed, were ordered down there yesterday; that Barringer's only got there. He is quite young and knows little or nothing but the above. The men from Anderson's are of a better class than usual, and very reserved. General Mahone is commanding Anderson's division, and I can hear nothing of Ewell's corps.

Respectfully,

GEORGE H. SHARPE,

Colonel, &amp;c.
