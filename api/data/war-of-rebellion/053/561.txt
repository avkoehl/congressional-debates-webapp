Sixtieth, Sixty-first, and Sixty-second Tennessee Regiments. These are all the regiments belonging to his brigade.

Reynolds' brigade, Stevenson's division, consists of Third Tennessee-Vaughn's old regiment-and the Thirty-first, Forty second, and Fifty-ninth Tennessee.

Gregg's brigade consists of Fifth Tennessee and one Texas regiment.

I would propose that Vaughn's old regiments, now in Reynolds' brigade, be transferred to Vaughn's brigade, and that one of the Tennessee regiments in Gregg's brigade be transferred to Reynolds. Vaughn's brigade was ordered to reassemble in East Tennessee, at such place as General Buckner might designate. But if the men have been seized by the enemy and their paroles taken from them, it will prevent their reorganization.

Adjutant and Inspector General.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL:

Proposed transfers approved. Let them be ordered to reorganize.

GENERAL: By orders of to-day, Walker, partially arrived, is placed under your orders, and Breckinridge fast following. I send you a letter which sums up all we have from Burnside, and which I am disposed to credit. It is on this, I think, Buckner is acting.

A few hours since an old citizen from the other side of the river reported Rosecrans' headquarters at Jasper, and his troops moving up Sequatchie Valley. No crossing below this. Some shelling yesterday, killing 3 and wounding 3. No other news except inspection of Wheeler's cavalry shows it worse than even we thought.

Yours, respectfully,

W. W. MACKALL.
