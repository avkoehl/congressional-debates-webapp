FORT MONROE, VA., April 11, 1862-5 p.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have not failed to keep you advised of what is passing in Hampton Roads. Among other conjectures it is thought the Merrimac intends to make her way to Yorktown to relieve the rebels of our gunboats, and to drive us from Ship Point, where he had his depot of supplies. I will keep you advised of all movements, if it is possible. The flag-officer has at last furnished us with a gunboat to keep the enemy's boats from entering Hampton Creek.

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.

From the statement of [an] eye witness of the capture I learn that the vessels captured were at least from 5 to 6 miles from my encampment. It is to be regretted that you had not informed yourself of the true position of my troops before making any statement about them. The false idea which your telegram conveys I trust you will correct at once. The first intimation of the appearance of the Merrimac I received from yourself.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
