Report of General Joseph E. Johnston, C. S. Army, commanding Army of Tennessee, of operations December 27, 1863-July 17, 1864.

VINEVILLE, GA., October 20, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to make the following report of the operations of the Army of Tennessee while it was under my command. Want of the reports of the lieutenant-generals, for which I have waited until now, prevents me from being circumstantial:

In obedience to the orders of the President, received by telegraph at Clinton, Miss., December 18, 1863, I assumed command of the Army of Tennessee at Dalton on the 27th of that month.

Letters from the President and Secretary of War, dated, respectively, December 23 and 20, impressed upon me the importance of soon commencing active operations against the enemy. The relative forces, including the moral effect of the affair of Missionary Ridge, condition of the artillery horses and most of those of the cavalry, and want of field transportation, made it impracticable to effect the wishes of the Executive.

On December 31 the effective total of the infantry and artillery of the army, including two brigades belonging to the Department of Mississippi, was 36,826. The effective total of the cavalry, including Roddey's command at Tuscumbia, was 5,613. The Federal force in our front, exclusive of cavalry, and the Ninth and Twenty-third Corps at Knoxville, was estimated at 80,000. The winter was mainly employed in improving the discipline and equipment of the army and bringing back absentees to the ranks. At the end of April more that 5,000 had rejoined their regiments.

The horses of the cavalry and artillery had been much reduced in condition by the previous campaign. As full supplies of forage
