The second section provides that the right
of way through the public lands be granted
to said Helena and Northern Utah Railroad
Company, its successors and assigns, for the
construction of a railroad and telegraph as
proposed ; and the right, power, and authority
are given to said corporation to take, from the
public lands adjacent to the line of said road,
material of earth, stone, timber, &c., for the
construction thereof; said way is granted to
said railroad to the extent of one hundred
feet in width on each side of said railroad, where
it may pass through the public domain, includ-
ing all necessary ground (not to exceed twenty
acres for each ten miles of railroad) for sta-
tion buildings, workshops, depots, machine-
shops, switches, side tracks, turn-tables, and
water stations. Said company is fully author-
ized and empowered to issue its bonds, and to
secure the same by mortgage upon its railroad
property, for the purpose of raising funds with
which to construct said railroad.
The third section provides that said Helena
and Northern Utah railroad shall be con-
structed in a substantial and workmanlike
manner, with all the necessary draws, cul-
verts, bridges, viaducts, crossings, turn-outs,
stations, and watering-places, and all other
appurtenances, including furniture and roll-
ing stock, equal in all respects to railroads of
the first class when prepared for business.
And it shall be the duty of said company to
permit any other railroad which shall be
authorized to be built by the United States,
or by the Legislature of any Territory or State
in which the same may be situated, to form
running connections with it on fair and equit-
able terms.
The fourth section provides that the said rail-
road company be authorized and empowered
to enter upon, purchase, take, and hold any
lands or premises that may be necessary and
proper for the coustructiou and working of
said road, not exceeding in width one hundred
feet on each side of the line of its railroad,
unless a greater width be required for the pur-
pose of excavation or embankments; and also
any lands or premises that may be necessary and
proper for turnouts, standing places for cars,
depots, station-houses, or any other structures
required in the construction and working of
said road. And the said company shall have the
right to cut and remove trees and other mate-
rial that might, by falling, encumber its road'
bed, though standing or being more than one
hundred feet from the line of said read. And in
case the owner of such lands or premises and
the said company cannot agree as to the value
of the premises taken, or to be taken, for the
use of said road, the value thereof shall be
determined by the appraisal of three disinter-
ested commissioners, who may be appoiuted,
upon application by either party to any dis-
trict judge or court in the Territory in which
the lands or premises to be taken lie ; and
compensation for lands so taken shall be made
by the award of said commissioners to the
extent to which the owner shall be injuriously
affected thereby, irrespective of any benefits
accruing to him by reason of the construc-
tion of the road. And upon return into court
of such appraisement, and upon the pay-
ment into the same of the estimated value
of the premises taken, for the use and bene-
fit of the owner thereof, said premises shall
be deemed to be taken by said company,
which shall thereby acquire full title to the
same for the purposes atoreeaid. And either
party feeling aggrieved at said appraisement
may, within thirty days after the same has
been returned into court, file an appeal there-
from, and demand a jury of twelve men to
estimate the damage -sustained; bnt such ap-
peal shall not interfere with the rights of said
company to enter upon the premises taken or
to do any act necessary and proper in the con-
struction of its road. And said party appeal-
ing shall give bonds, with sufficient surety or
sureties, for the payment of any cost that may
arise upon such appeal; and in case the party
appealing does not obtain a verdict increasing
the award of the commissioners, such party
shall pay the whole cost incurred by the ap-
pellee as well as his own, and the payment
into court for the use of the owner of said
premises taken of a sum equal to that finally
awarded shall be held to vest in said com-
pany the title of said land, and of the right
to use and occupy the same for the con-
struction, maintenance, and operation of said
road. And in case any of the lands-to be
taken as aforesaid shall be held by any infant,
feme covert, non compos, insane person, or
person residing without the territory within
which the lands to be taken lie, or person
subjected to any legal disability, the court
may appoint a guardian for any party under
any disqualification, to appear in proper
person, who shall give bonds, with sufficient
surety or sureties, for the proper and faithful
execution of his trust, and who may represent
in court the person disqualified as aforesaid
from appearing, when the same proceedings
shall be had in reference to the appraisement
of the premises to be taken for the use of said
company and with the same effect as has been
already described. And in case any party
shall have a right or claim to any land for a
term of years, or any interest therein, in pos-
session, reversion, or remainder, the value of
any such estate less than a fee-simple shall be
estimated and determined in the manner here-
inbefore set forth. And in case it shall be
necessary for the company to enter upon any
lands which are unoccupied, and of which
there is no apparent owner or claimant, it may
proceed to take and use the same for the pur-
poses of said railroad, and may institute pro-
ceedings, in manner described, for the pur-
pose of ascertaining the value of, and acquir-
ing a title to, the same; but the judge of the
court hearing said suit shall determine the
kind of notice to be served on such owner or
owners, and he may in his discretion appoint
an agent or guardian to represent such owner
or owners, in case of his or their incapacity or
non-appearance. But in case no claimant
shall appear within six years from the time of
the opening of said road across said land, all
claims to damages against said company shall
be barred.
The fifth section provides that said railroad
or any part thereof shall be a post route and a
military road, subject to the use of the United
States for postal, military, naval, and all other
Government service, and also subject to such
regulations as Congress may impose restricting
the charges for such Government transporta-
tion.
The sixth section provides that the directors
chosen in pursuance of the first section of this
act shall, so soon as may be after their elec-
tion, elect from their own number a president
and a vice president; and said board of direct-
ors shall, from time to time, and so soon as
may be after their election, choose a treasurer"
and a secretary, who shall hold their offices at
the will and pleasure of the board of directors.
The treasurer and the secretary shall give such
bonds with such security as the said board
from time to time may require. The secretary
shall, before entering upon his duty, be sworn
to the faithful discharge thereof, and said oath
shall be made a matter of record upon the
books of said corporation. No person shall
be a director of said company unless he shall be
a stockholder and qualified to vote for directors
at the election at which he shall be chosen.
The seventh section provides that the presi-
dent, vice president, and directors shall hold
their offices for the period indicated in the by-
laws of the said company, and until others are
chosen in their place and qualified. In case
it shall so happen that an election of directors
shall not be made on any day appointed by the
by-laws of said company, the corporation shall
not, for that cause, be deemed to be dissolved,
but such election may be holden 011 any day
which shall be appointed by the directors.
The directors, of whom four shall be a quorum
for the transaction of business, shall have full
power to make and prescribe such by-laws,
rules, and regulations as they shall deem need-
ful and proper touching the disposition and
management of the stock, property, estate, and
effects of the company, the transfer of shares,
the duties and conduct of their officers and ser-
vants, the election and meeting of the direct-
ors, and all matters whatsoever which may
appertain to the concerns of said company ;
and the said board of directors may have full
power to fill any vacancy or vacancies that may
occur from any cause or causes, from time to
time, in their said board ; and the said board of
directors shall have power to appoint such en-
gineers, agents, and subordinates as may, from
time to time, be necessary to carry into effect
the object of the company, and to do all acts
and things touching the location, construction,
and management of said road.
The eighth section provides that it shall be
lawful for the directors of sard company to
require payment of the sum of five per cent,
cash assessment upon all subscriptions re-
ceived of all subscribers, and the balance
thereof at such times, and in such portions,
and on such conditions as they shall deem to
be necessary to complete the said road and
telegraph line. Sixty days' previous notice
