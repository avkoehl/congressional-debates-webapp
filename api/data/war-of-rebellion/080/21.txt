HEIGHTS SOUTH OF PETERSBURG, June 16, 1864-8 a.m.

(Via Jamestown Island 12.30 p.m. Received 4 p.m. 17th.)

The success of Smith last night was of the most important character. He carried these heights, which were defended by works of the most formidable character, and this gives us perfect, command of the city and railroad. The enemy, still hold south of the city and west of the river, but their position of little comparative value. General Smith says the negro troops fought magnificently. His loss is in round numbers 750, of which 500 were among the negroes. He took 16 cannon.

DOUTHAT'S LANDING, VA., June 16, 1864-1 p.m.

(Received 11.45 p.m.)

After sending my dispatch of this morning from the heights southeast of Petersburg I went over the conquered lines with General Grant and the engineer officers. The works are of the very strongest kind, more difficult even to take than was Missionary Ridge, at Chattanooga. The hardest fighting was done by the black troops. The forts they stormed were, I think, the worst of all. After the affair was over General Smith went to thank them and tell them he was proud of their courage and dash. He says they cannot be exceeded as soldiers, and that hereafter he will send them in a difficult place as readily as the best white troops. They captured six out of the sixteen cannons which he took. The prisoners he took were from Beauregard's command: some of them said they had just crossed the James above Drewry's Bluff. I do not think any of Lee's army had reached Petersburg when Smith stormed it. They seem to be there this morning, however, and to be making arrangements to hold the west side of the Appomattox; the town they cannot think of holding, for its lies directly under our guns. The weather continues splendid.

DOUTHAT'S LANDING, June 16, 1864-2.30 p.m.

I have come down here from Petersburg to see how the crossing advances. I find the rear of Warren's corps just being ferried across. The great wagon train will all be over the bridge by daylight to-morrow morning. The cavalry (Wilson's division) will also pass over in the night, leaving Wright's corps to hold the rear. The line of defense across the neck here is about a mile long and very strong, extending from one swamp to another. The last of the army will no doubt be south of the James River by noon to-morrow. I must here say that the unprecedented pontoon bridge, nearly 700 yards long, constructed by Major Duane, is of the most admirable solidity. After Duane had nearly finished it Benham came up and took charge.
