State p oteetun, nere of tr^at ciass
Mr CALHOUN would be happy to hear them
named, that he might procure a catalogue
Mr WEBSTER would explain, by naming the
institution of mints, as they existed  before the
I Confederacy This was one ef what be termed
domestic institutions
1 Mr C \LHOUN assumed that theie weretiow
many institutions so far domestic as to be wholly
'   within the control of States wherem they existed.
j   Such was negro slavery    The gentleman's views
1 evidently diflered materially from his No one
could support an argument against his views re-
| spectmg slavery He could name a long catalogue
of institutions controlled wholly oy States on the
1 s= me ground He would noi, m establishing such
control, inquire and mark out the dividing line of
public opinion   m the premises     It was alike the
1    s icred right of all, whether of the Noith or South
Thes.e rights, were institutions growing out of the
Constitution, ">nd which must be maintained, and
could never be meddled with by   others, but with
the greatest danger to the confederacy
Mr WEBSTER inferred from the gentleman's
'   argument, that the question was not whether there
I were not ¡>ome domestic institutions beyond the
reach of the Constitution,  but 1* claims that all
I   such w ere bey ond its control     It was on this point
1   his principle objections were founded
i       Mr C4LHOUN had no objection  to striking
I out all to meet the v lews of the Senator from Mas
sichuselts, (Mr Webstei,) it it vas tht wish 0
I   the Senate so to amend
