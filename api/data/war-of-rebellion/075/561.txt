HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,Near Kenesaw Mountain, Ga., June 22, 1864-8.30 p. m.

[General GEORGE H. THOMAS:]

GENERAL: Just after leaving you I learned that General Hooker's lines were being assaulted. Two regiments of Newton's, two of Wood's, and five of Stanley's were sent immediately and relieved two brigades of Butterfield's division, which were pushed over to the support of Williams. The assault was upon Williams' front, and was very handsomely repulsed.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

P. S.-As soon as I can get Stanley's division I can relieve the rest of Butterfield's division.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Big Shanty, June 22, 1864.

General HOOKER:

Dispatch received. Schofield was ordered this morning to be on the Powder Springs and Marietta road in close support of your right. Is not this the case? There cannot be three corps in your front. Johnston has but three corps, and I know from personal inspection that a full proportion is now and has been all day on his right and center.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

KOLB'S HOUSE, GA.,

June 22, 1864-3.15 p. m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE:

GENERAL: I desire that Geary's and Butterfield's divisions may be relieved by divisions from other corps, in order that my line may be sufficiently contracted to render it safe. If done at all it should be done at once.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.

KOLB'S HOUSE, GA.,

June 22, 1864-4 p. m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE:

GENERAL: Concurrent testimony of prisoners represent that the whole rebel army lies between my immediate front and Marietta, and that they are marching in this direction. General Schofield has one division here, and all are at work making their defensive arrangements. My line is too long to make an obstinate defense. In my judgment, Butterfield's and Geary's divisions should be relieved and marched to the right.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.
