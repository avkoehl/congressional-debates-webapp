General FITZ JOHN PORTER,Near Sharpsburg:

The commanding general will leave all the troops that can be spared from this army to guard the line of the river from Sharpsburg to Cumberland. This is a highly important service, and requires some officer of rank to superintend it. He has thought of General Morell in connection with it. How would he like this service? Please give me an answer at the earliest practicable moment.
