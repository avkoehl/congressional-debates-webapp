HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,May 19, 1864-5.30 p.m.

General WILCOX,

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: One of General Grant's officers reported to me that there is a gap between your picket-line and General Wright's, or between yours and General Crittenden's. I think he must be mistaken, but choose to report it to you, in order that you may determine positively.

Brigadier-General FERRERO,

Commanding Fourth Division, Ninth Army Corps:

The enemy have crossed the Ny, to the right of our lines, in considerable force, and may possibly detach a force to move on Fredericksburg. Keep your cavalry pickets well out on the plank road, and all other roads leading and west of you. If you find the enemy moving infantry and artillery toward you, report it promptly. In that case, take up strong positions and detain him all you can, turning all your trains back to Fredericksburg, and whatever falling back you may be forced to do, do in that direction. I do not think the enemy will detach in that direction, but give you this warning in time, in case they should. Require all trains coming to the front, to come by the Massaponax Church road.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Commanding OFFICER BATTN. HEAVY ARTY., JUNCTION OF FREDERICKSBURG AND SPOTSYLVANIA AND TELEGRAPH ROADS:

The major-general commanding direct that you station a guard at the junction of the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania Court-House and Telegraph roads, with instructions to prevent any trains or wagons coming to the army from going farther than that point on the main road to Spotsylvania, directing them to take the road leading to Massaponax Church. Similar instructions will be communicated by the guards to all troops, individual officers, and messengers coming to the army.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
