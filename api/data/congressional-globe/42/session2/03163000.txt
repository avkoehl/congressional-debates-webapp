Mr. BECK. I de sire to say one word.
Mr. MAYNARD. I do not care how long
these pro bono publico explanations go on,
provided they are not taken out of the time
allotted to myself.
Mr. BECK. I will not occupy a minute.
I will explain why 1 made the statement to
which the gentleman from Massachusetts lias
referred. I made it because the last report
of the Secretary of the Treasury shows, on
page 5. that the expenditures of the War De-
partment last year were $35,000,000 ; and his
report also shows that the appropriation for
them was only $29,500,000. The report of
the Secretary of the Treasury, while it gives
the expenditures of the War Department as
$85,799,991 82, upon page o of the appendix
to the report states the amount expended by
the military Department in detail thus :

Mr. DAWES. I stated at the time that it
was only a book-keeping. I had seen the books
oi the War Department, and seen that they
covered every dollar of the expenditures.
Mr. BECK. But only $29,500,000 were
appropriated, as the laws show.
Mr. DAWES. Oh, no; the gentleman is
mistaken there. There was a general appro-
priation, of which this is the balance. You
will see in the Globe of to-morrow all the
warrants.
Mr. MAYNAltD, As this its an entirely
new subject, it has never been heard of before
in the House. Of course the Chair's eye will
fall upon the dial at this particular moment
and will not charge me with the time that has
been occupied by this explanation.
MESSAGE -BT.OM THIS PRESIDENT
A message from the President of the United
States, by Mr. Babcock, one of his secretaries
informed the House that the President had
approved and signed a bill of the following
title: &
A bill (H. K. No. 174) repealing the duty
on tea and coffee.
The message also announced that the bill
i'H. K. No. 1C70) for the relief of Isaac B.
Kinkead, received by the President April 15.
1872, and not having been returned within ten
days (Sundays excepted) after presentation
has become a law under the Constitution.
TAltll'F.
The Committee of the Whole on the state
of the Union resumed its session.
Mr. MAYNARD addressed the committee.
[His remarks will be found m the Appendix.]
Mr. KERR also addressed the committee.
[His remarks will be found in the Appendix.]
In the course of Mr. Kxkb's speech,
Mr. DAWES said: 1 would like to state to the
House that there aie quite a uuntber of gentle-
men still desiring to speak upon this question,
and I hope they will bear in mind that the
debate closes to-morrow ai three o'clock;
that the order was made, and a motion to
reconsider laid upon the table, so that, as I
understand the rules, it is fixed. If any gen-'
tiemen will come here to debate the bill this
evening, I will try and have the House here,
and 1 wouid like to have an indication of the
wish of the House on that subject so that we
may not come here and have no one to speak.
Mr. KERR. I cannot yield for that purpose
now.
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE.
The committee rose informally; and the
Speaker having resumed the chair, a menage
hom the Senate, by Mr. Sympson, one of us
clerks, announced that the Senate had passed,
without amendment, the bill (H. R. No. 1194)
directing the proper accounting officers of the
Treasury to credit John Says, of Ohio, with
the sum therein named.
TAKltfff.
The Committee of the Whole then resumed
its session.
Mr. CROSSLAND. I yield the remainder
of my time to the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania, [Mr. Speek.]
Mr. SPEEIl, of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair-
man, the proper regulation of the fiuauees
ot the country is at once difficult and import-
ant. That we must have revenue to defray
the expenses of the Government, pay the in-
terest on its debt, and provide for i,he gradual
reduction of the principal, is not questioned
by any man or party. But how shall this
revenue be raised? From what source shall
it be drawn? These are the questions that
meet us at the threshold, and must be settled
before anything practical can be done. The
answers to these questions are as numerous
and conflicting as the interests of the country
themselves. Nor is this surprising. With our
extended and diversified territory ; our ocean
and inland communication; our vast mineral
wealth, and our boundless agricultural re-
sources, it is to be expected that the friends
and representatives of the various interests
and elements that make cur country so great
and so prosperous will not be able always to
see and to think alike. And it may be best
that it is so. Zeal, guided by wisdom and
earnestness, free from selfishness, will give to
the nation wholesome legislation, and to the
people continued prosperity.
No stronger evidence of"the difficulties at-
tending the regulation of the national revenues
can be furnished than we have in the action
