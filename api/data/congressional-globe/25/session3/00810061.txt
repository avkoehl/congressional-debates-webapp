Treasury Depvrtmevt,
December 24, 1838
Sir I have the honor to submit this report m
compliance with the lesolution of the Senate on
the 19th instant, a copy of which is annexed
The lesolution calls foi mfoimation concerning
deposits in the United Stat s Bink of Pennsylva-
nia, the svleof its third bond the payment of its
second oup, uid various othei matteis supposed
to be connected with those subjects
The tianstctions between the lieasury and
tne United States Buik of Pennsylvania, which
seem to be the gtneial object of tntse inquiries,
have been as fo lows
1    The  sale to that institution  of the stock
held by the Governmental the Bank of the United
States in puisuancc of a law passed foi that pui
pose, an account of which has been long since
laid befoie Congiess
2     The receipt of payment fiom the United
S Ues Buik oi Pennsylvania for two of Us bonds
about the time they beexme due, and which weie
given foi tnat «iock
3    Collections made by that bank for the Uni-
ted States, in pait payment of then demand
against ti e old Bank of Columon, trom which
the Bank of the United States had taken secuuty
tor itself and foi the United Sta es many years
ago, and to tht perfoin anee of which tiust the
United Statts Bank of Pennsylvania had suc-
ceeded
4    The payment 1 y the latter b-nik to the Uni
ted States of the sum of  J 100,000 m money and
■$5°.,üu0 in lieastuy no es, n   behalf of and at
the instance  ol the  Bmk  of Kentucky, m dis

ted States
5    Tin sale to the United States BtnkofPenn
sjlvama ot the thud bond duefiom it to the Tjin
kd States in execution of the act ot the last scs
sion ciuthoiizmg it
With these exceptions, theio have not been
dealings of any description between this Oi pait
men and the United Slates Bank of Pennsylvania
fiom its establishment to the present day No
collect'ngoi disbuistng offieei has ever been di
rected by this Department to make any deposit
whatevei in said bank, noi has any money been
placed bv the said bank to the ciedit of the Xieas
uiei of the United States oi of this Department,
oi, to my knowledge, of any of its offieeis, ex-
cept the avails of the tiansactions specifically re
fened to above, and, on the details of which, so
far as ti ey i elate to the present subject, full in
foimation is given in the correspondence and tab-
ular statements annexed
Ihe sale oí the thud bond of the United States
Bank of Pennsylvania to that institution, con-
cerning wmch a more special inquiry is made in
the resolution, was effected under the following
encumstances Before the passage of the lawau
thon7*ng it, an application was made to the De-
paitment by the bank, to anticipate the payment
of a poition of the debt due from it to the United
States, upon certain teims pioposed by its agent
This application failed of effect, because the bank
was dissatisfied with the conditions as to the kind
of cuiiency to be paid which weie piescubed by
the Depaitment The eonespondence upon that
subject is consideied to be embraced within the
call of the Senate, and is hereunto annexed Ap-
prehending that the resources of the Tieasury
would not, in the then deiangi d state of the busi-
ness and cuiiency of the countiy, with ceitain
impei fictions that existed in the laws as toTieas
ur> notes, be sufficient to satisfy the appropria-
tions made by Congiess, the President, some
months befoie the adjournment of the last session,
specially invited the attention of both Houses to
the necessity of fuithei piovision foi the exigen-
cies of the public seiviee
An act whs afteiwaids passed authorizing an
issue of new Tieasuiy notes, instead of the old
ones paid in during the year It becoming obvious
that this mt asure would not of itself be sufficient
under the laige appropuation contemplited,abill
was also lepoited a'bwmg the sale of the thud
and fourth bonds held by the Government against
the bank The bill, as i epoi ted and finally passed,
contained a restriction limiting the sale to " the
par value of tne bond sold at the time of sale, cal
culated accoiding to the lules for estimating the
par value ot securities upon which mteiest has
mn for a time, but which secuuties have not
reached maturity," and it conf ired on the De-
partment no authonty to enter into any guai an tee
by the United States of the ultimate payment of
the bonds Apprehensive that it would be diffi
cult, if not impossible to effect a sale of the bonds
oi either of them upon these teims, the Depart-
ment, whilst the bill was pending, opened a cor-
íespondence to ascertain whethei the same could
probably be accomplished, if the bill became a
law This eonespondence is annexed The re-
phes stiengthened the apprehension befoie enter-
tained by the Department, and tlu result was
communicated to the chaamen of the finanoial
committees of tne two Houses before the final
action of Congiess upon tin bill
But the bill afterwaids became a law without
any alteration in the teims, oi any guaranty to
be given, on the pu* of the Unued States ihe
appropnationsactua lv made having pioved to be
unusually great, and the cxpendituies anticipated
during the two ne\t ensuing months being much
laiger in amount than theimmedi ue means which
the Department would expect to denv in money
fiom othei souiees within those months, I at
once addiesstd letter  to bankeis of the United
btates at London and to oui Mmistei at Paris,
lequesting that nu asmes might be taken, without
di lay, to obtain olTeis toi those bonds, if possi
ble, fiom cipitahsts in Europe To these, an-
swers were ltceived in due season, stating that
fiom the shoit time the bonds had to urn, the
absence of the guaiantee of the United States ioi
then eventual pay m nt, and othei causes no sale
could probablj be effecte 1 of them eithei m Lon
don oi Pans within the limits fixed by law In
the meantime, howevei, finding that the demands
for the public scivice duung the month of June,
had exeeeded foiu and a half million dollars, and
expi cting, as the fact turned out to be, that they
would equal about seven millions in July and
August, and finding also, that the available bal
anee in the Tieasuiy, applicable to general pur-
poses and subject to dsaft, tell below one million
dolíais, and that payments were making at times
11 new Tieasuiy notes, which could not be ten
deied at all available, I considered it necessary to
effect a sale of at least one of the bonds at an
eaihci day than advices could be leceived, and
any proeieds íealized fiom Europe     Partieulai
inquiry was, therefore, instituted in the city of
New York, and elsewhere, concerning the piob-
ability of selling soon one or moie of the bonds,
and, also, a public advertisement was issued, in-
viting proposals generally foi their purchase
J     The iisuit was, that from the abundance of
State stocks in the market, at veiy reduced prices,
I the lowei  late at which other securities of the
bank weie selling, and the want of a guarantee by
| the United States, the sale was found, with the
exception hereafter stated, to be wholly ímprac-
| ticable m this country, and was expected to be
i so abioad,under the conditions prescribed in the
act     Indeed, no bids were at any time made for
eithei of the bonds, in conformity to those con-
, ditions, except that of Charles Macahster, Esq ,
I of Philadelphia, who offered to purchase both of
i them within the terms of the law     In answer to
1 some other particular inquines on this point, I
would observe that the pui chase money for the
bond which was sold, " was placed to the credit
of the -Treasurer on the books of the bank," the
1st day of August, 1838
" The teims on which it was negotiated" were
at the par value of the bond at that time, comput-
ing it under the limitations prescribed in the act
of Congiess, and the payment was expressly
stipulated to be made in specie, or its equivalent,
and placed to the eridit of the Treasurer in special
deposit in the Bank of the United States The
Depaitment, hoping it might be able to get
through the year without the sale of more than
one bond, piovided the second one, due in Sep-
tember, was paid punctually.and m money rather
I than new Tieasuiy notes not íeissuable, and if
] distppointed m this, that it might soon have a
bettei offei fiom abioad, concluded the sale un-
I conditionally of only one bond But it may be
1 propel lieie to notice the circumstance that as no
I other o(TU has since been received in this coun
tiy oi Put ope to puiehase eithei of the bonds foi
| cash within the terms of the act, and as it will
piobably be found necessaty to sell the other
bond duungthepresentyiai embanassmentmay
arise in effecting the sale within those terms, ex-
cept to the bank itself unless Congiess authorize
the guaiantee to be given of i's eventual pay-
ment Indeed, it will be perceived, from these
remaiks and the annexed eonespondence, that
the authonty to make sale of the remaining bond,
as limited in the present law, if continuid with-
out alteration will, in efiect, as it has done al
ready, amount to a direction to sell the same,
when necessary, to the United States Bank The
likelihood of offers fiom othei quarters to buy it
is no gieater now than heietufoie
Inquiry is next made as to the " particulars of
any understanding oi agi ernent that the proceeds
of the same should be left in deposit w ith the said
bank, until wanted in the oidmaiy disbuisements
i of the Government "
' I hose paiticulais, as shown in the letters an
nexed, were, thai the bank should, without ex
pense or cost to the Un ted States, hold this
j monev in special deposit to the ciedit of the
I Treasuiei, till ihe same was wanted foi the public
service, and should then pay his vaiious drafts,
aspiesented, v ithout any charge to the Tieasurv
I Ihe Depaitment being deprived of its usual
depositories, and the sum being very large, these
stipulations weie íeadily assented to To avoid
the payment of the bond that was to fall due on
the 1st of October, being made in new Pnasuiy
notes, not reissuable, nor available m any way to
dischaige appiopnatons, and which event was
appiehended by the D | artment, the wntten
agreement was made with the bank, which will
be found among thed Kumi nts,stipuluing,among
other things, for the payment ot that bond on
drafts to the piblir cieditois, and in specie or its
tquivilent ihis, tl ough collateral to the sale oí
the othei bondb, was a pait of the same negotia
Hon
It was very c'eai at the tmie, and has been con-
fia mid by sub equent events, that the payment
by the bank of its bond in such Treasury notes,
and a failme to make that anangement the only
pi icucabie one for the sale of the third bond,
would icndei eithei a special call of Congress or
a suspension of payment of some of thedemands
i upon the Treasury inevitable    The Depaitment
