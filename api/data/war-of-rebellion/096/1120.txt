FORT ANDERSON, January 21, 1865-8 a. m.

Colonel ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

All remains quiet, and, as far as can be seen, the enemy's fleet remains unchange. The weather, however, is rainy and misty, and we make observations with difficulty. I neglected to report last night that two vessels, apparently captured blockade-runners, had been brought up to the fleet. We judged so from the fact that one had a Confederate flag, another an English flag, with the U. S. flag flying over them.

LOUIS HEBERT,

Brigadier-General.

It is now so foggy that nothing of the fleet can be observed form this point.
