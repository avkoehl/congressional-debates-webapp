THE COiiGRESSKHffAL GLOBE:

decide upon it,and when he decided upon it, decide
also upon its necessary consequences, the ques-
tion of the admission of those gentlemen. But
(said he) let us decide first the previous question,
and if we say that Michigan is to be admitted as
a member of the Confederacy, with a right to
send Senators here, those gentlemen will at once
take their seats as their right. For the reasons
he had given he was opposed to the resolution,
and should vote against it.
Mr. BENTON said he had not examined into
the precedents, for the sake of which this subject
was, on the last day of their session, laid over at
the instance of the Senator from Ohio. He had
not examined those precedents, for it did seem to
him that on a question of mere courtesy it did not
become the Senate of the United States to be fol-
lowing precedents, but to make them. He did
not think that when a mere question of what was
decent and proper came before them, they ought
to suspend their action until they looked into
musty records for precedents. When a gentleman
brought a letter to him from a respectable source,
he at least asked him to take a seat until he read
it; and here (said he) these gentlemen have brought
a letter from a State, defacto, signed by a high
official functionary, and we are to hesitate before
we extend to them an act of common courtesy!
By th« principles laid down in the report of the
case of the Senator from Rhode Island, these
gentlemen had a right to this act of courtesy he
asked for them, and to more—they had a right to
all the privileges of Senators till the decision of
the question of their admission; but he did not
ask this much for them; he only asked that the
gentlemen might, in common courtesy, be re-
quested to take seats until their rights were
decided upon.
Had there been (he asked) a single instance
since the formation of the Government, in which
this courtesy had been refused to gentlemen
coming from a new State ? Were they to be con-
fined to precedents; and if so, how far were they
to go back to look for them ? What difficulty
had there ever been experienced before in a case
of this nature ? Had there been any attempt, on
the part of any one thus admitted, to take part in
debate ? Had any one attempted to give a vote—
to stand up when the votes were counted ? Had
there been a single attempt to intrude into the
secret sessions of the Senate ? There had been
none. Asgentlemen, they would, when the order
was given to clear the galleries, go out; and if
they did not, some one would give them a hint
to that effect. But it had been said that the
adoption of the resolution would prejudge the
case of the admission of Michigan into the Union;
that the mere courtesy of asking the gentlemen
to sit down, was to commit the Senate as to their
admission as Senators. Are we of such treach- I
erous memories as not to recollect what took
place with regard to the admission of Missouri
into the Union ? Were the Senators from Mis-
souri not sent back after having had seats assigned
them ? Was there one single Senator influenced
in the vote he gave on that occasion by the fact,
that seats had been assigned to the Missouri
Senators pending the question of their admis-
sion? He (Mr. B.) was here as one of those
Senators, and was told by that accomplished
gentleman and amiable man who then filled the
chair [Mr. Gaillard] to take his seat; and he
(Mr. B.) had all the incidental privileges of a
Senator extended to him. He had the right to
frank documents to wherever he pleased; and he
had the privilege of using the stationery of the
Senate; notwithstanding the question of right
was decided against him and he was sent home.
As to the question of the admission of Michigan,
he, for one, remained not only uncommitted, but
undecided as to the course he should take.
Mr. CLAYTON said, it appeared to him that
this was not like any of the cases that had oc- '
curred.    There was one distinct difference pre- I
sented itself.    The Territory of Michigan in-
cluded a portion of the State of Indiana, as that
Territory had been laid off. This measure looked '
strongly as affecting the rights of Indiana.    He i
adverted to a portion of Illinois which went to
Wisconsin under a former ordinance.   But they
were called upon to act on the grounds of cour-
tesy.   He would go as far in matters of polite-
! ness as any gentleman. One of the Senators
from Illinois was dead, and before taking any
measures on this subject, both her members
ous;!it to be present. The honorable gentleman
says it is not the intention to admit them during
executive sessions. If so, the resolution should
so express it. If they could be admitted without
infringing on the rights of Missouri, .Illinois,
Ohio, or the Senate of the United States, he
would be willing to extend the courtesy asked for.
Mr. KING, of Alabama, said the object of this
resolution is to admit persons to a seat on this
floor. By a resolution adopted by the Senate, no
person is entitled to that privilege except the per-
sons designated in it. He wotrld have no objec-
tion to these gentlemen taking seats outside of
the bar, and hoped the gentleman from Missouri
would so modify his resolution as to permit them
to take seats without the bar.
The question was then taken on Mr. Ben-
ton's motion, and the subject was laid on the
table.

Mr. HA-WES had no objection to the gentle-

was usuat to ballot for those officers. Under-
