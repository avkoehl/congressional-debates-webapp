Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

The following is the reply of Captain Duvall to the dispatch sent him in relation to the inefficiency of the guard at Hog Island:

EASTVILLE, VA., October 14, 1863.

Colonel CHESEBROUCH,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I hope the report is untrue. The island is guarded by a squad of 12 men of Captain Smith's company, and he has assured me the officer, though one of the non-commissioned, is a most faithful man. There can be no danger this time, for there is a force from Old Point with a steamer in the Sound, and troops on the adjoining island. I will look to it at once, and make sure there can come no harm. I will report to you to-morrow.

R. E. DUVALL,

Captain.
