July 1, the SECOND mine was explode. Previous to this time I had constructed there wooden mortars, one 6 -pounder and two 12-pounders, and put two of them into position about 100 yards from the main redoubt. Immediately after the explosion I commenced shelling the crater, dropping nearly every shell into the proper place. This fire I kept up at intervals for-forty-eight hours, varying the direction from the small redan on the left of the main redoubt, with telling effect. The enemy's engineer in charge of these works, captain Kelly, of General Hebert's staff, assured me 21 men were killed and 72 wounded by these shells. During these forty-eight hours I fired 102 rounds of 6-pounder and 366 of 12-pounder shells. To [Corpl]S. W. Dunning, one hundred and twenty-fourth Illinois Infantry, my assistant, I am under many obligations for his cool determination and gallant courage on June 25 and throughout the siege; also to Captain Moore and Lieutenant Hoover, of Major General Logan's staff, for their valuable assistance in superintending the construction of rifle-pits and roads. During the siege my pioneer corps obtained and used 370 wagon loads of lumber, built three magazines, put in platforms for all the heavy batteries, made 1,200 fascines, 650 gabions, 4 saprollers, and kept in repair all the broken trails and gun-carriages of the DIVISION. All of which is respectfully submitted.

Your obedient servant,

S. R. TRESILIAN,

DIVISION Engineer THIRD DIVISION, SEVENTEENTH Army Corps.

Pretty lively firing on my left, as if a sally. I have sent to Lauman and A. Hovey, if an attack occurs on either side of them, to re-enforce the point attacked.
