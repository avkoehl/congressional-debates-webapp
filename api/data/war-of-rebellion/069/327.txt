HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 11.45 a. m.

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

The present skirmish firing is from General Barlow, who is feeling his way with some skirmishers across the swamp to a crest, from which the enemy's skirmish line have been firing at this line of battle, with a view of determining whether there is really anything strong behind it or not. It does not look as if it were held very strong, and no bad result can follow even if it is.

SHELTON HOUSE.

Major-General HANCOCK:

The Shelton house is riddled by shot of enemy. Our batteries and mortars in front of the house have silenced for the present enemy's guns, our batteries doing spending work, almost every shot striking where aimed. Slight skirmishing going on now.

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

General Barlow's skirmishers took the first crest beyond the creak, but the enemy held a hill still beyond and commanding it; and the brigade commander, after suffering some little loss, thought it well to withdraw the skirmishers. But General Barlow is about to relieve the skirmishers with another line, and will continue his efforts, probably with a better result. i have no doubt that General Barlow will be able to hold across the creek, because the loss on our side and the numbers of the enemy seen did not show a necessity of withdrawal. A wounded rebel, taken on the other side of the creek, reports that Ewell's corps is on our front in force.
