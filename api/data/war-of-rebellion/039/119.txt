bridges destroyed, 1 piece of artillery, 300 small-arms, 260 prisoners, and many fresh horses captured. Our loss 3 wounded; the enemy's, 12 killed and many wounded. The skill and daring of Colonel Harman were conspicuous on this occasion. Colonel Green again failed to execute the part assigned him.

Leaving our wounded in the hands of kind friends, at dark we resumed our march in search of General Imboden. Marching a few hours, we encamped, resuming the march early next morning. From some captured furloughed men finding Clarksburg occupied by the enemy, we crossed the Monongahela, went up Simpson's Creek, and captured the force at Bridgeport, 5 miles east of Clarksburg. This work was done by the Maryland cavalry, under the gallant Major Brown. Forty-seven prisoners were captured, with their arms and a few horses. A bridge to the left of the town was destroyed and a captured train run into the stream. Tall trestling to the right of town was burned. Marching until some time after dark, we encamped.

Moving on early the next day, gathering horses and cattle, we reached Philippi about noon. The enemy had damaged the bridge, but Lieutenant Williamson soon had it in condition to pass over the Sixth Virginia Cavalry, the led horses, and the cattle, all of which moved on the road to Beverly. Rid of this incumbrance, the remainder of my force marched on the road to Buckhannon, where I expected to join General Imboden. Being less apprehensive of danger, the march became more moderate.

On May 2, a few miles from Buckhannon, was received the first certain intelligence of General Imboden, we having met a man of his command on furlough. On my arrival in Buckhannon, I found General Imboden ready to move to Weston. General Roberts had retreated to Clarksburg by this road, the more direct roads having been rendered impassable by winter hauling for the troops of the enemy.

The original plan of campaign, as will be seen from my letter to you of March 31,* contemplated simultaneous attacks on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Grafton and Oakland by General Imboden and myself. Nothing different was for a moment entertained until after all was in motion, when a letter from General Imboden came, stating that I would reach Oakland the day he reached Beverly, so as to cut off re-enforcements from the east. It was now too late to rearrange or halt. Knowing the difficulty of moving wagons over mountain roads in early spring, I stipulated with General Imboden no such impediment should clog his movements after leaving Huttonsville. I was surprised to find a train of 70 wagons at Buckhannon. Had our original plan been carried out, I feel confident Northwestern Virginia could have been cleared to the Ohio. At this point Colonel Harman was sent to bring up from Beverly the Sixth Virginia Cavalry and the stragglers from other regiments, many having accompanied the led horses. My cavalry moved on the direct road to Clarksburg, and then on by-roads, flanking on the right that followed by General Imboden's command. At Weston we rested two days, during which time Colonel Harman returned with the re-enforcements from Beverly. Feeling confident much danger would attend the attack of Clarksburg, on consultation with General Imboden it was agreed he should move south, while my cavalry should assail the Northwestern Railroad toward Parkersburg.

This movement commenced on May 6. Colonel Harman, with the Twelfth and Eleventh Regiments and Thirty-fourth (Witcher's) Battal-
