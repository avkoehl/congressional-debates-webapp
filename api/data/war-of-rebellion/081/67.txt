General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

Can you inform me if General Ferrero's division is coming up; if not, where it will be found? There is quite a number of his men who have gone astray and are reporting here. It seems desirable that they should join their command as soon as possible.

General Ferrero's division is with the trains that commenced crossing at Cole's Ferry early this morning. The division will come in with the rear of trains to-morrow morning. The trains will cross the James at the bridge, and begin to cross as soon as they arrive, which they should do before midday.

HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 15, 1864-9.45 a.m.

General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

General Benham sends word that the bridge is now clear, no wagons or troops passing, and that it will have to be opened for the passage of vessels unless it is occupied. Is it the intention to have my troops pass over this morning? I have received no orders to that effect.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 15, 1864-9.50 a.m.

General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

The reason for sending the last dispatch was that General Benham sends me a request to occupy the bridge by commencing to move my troops, and I feared that an order had been sent me to move over the river but had not been received at these headquarters.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
