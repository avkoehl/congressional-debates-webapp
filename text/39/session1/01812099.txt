elaim from the United States, or make any
allowance or compensation for slaves eman-
cipated or liberated in any way whatever."
Now, sir, these slaves were the property of some-,
body, or else they eould not have been slaves,
and the Constitution expressly declares that
private property shall not be taken for public
use without just compensation.
Sir, I have heard a great deal said by gen-
tlemen upon this floor about the importance
and propriety of the Government complying
with its plighted faith and solemn promises
made to the colored people. This is all very
well; but, sir, a great Government like ours
should never place itself in such a condition
that the fulfillment of one promise is the direct
violation of another. Sir, what stronger pledge,
what more solemn promise, has this Govern-
ment ever made than the pledge to the white
people of these United States that their lives,
liberty, or property should not be taken with-
out due process of law; and then added the
clause above quoted, that private property
should not be taken without just compensation ?
Sir, no stronger promise or pledge has ever been
made to any people. It is true that this prom-
ise was made to white people; but that does
not make it less obligatory upon us. Sir, who
would have owned a slave if the Constitution
and laws of the country had not authorized it?
Being thus authorized, the people of Tennes-
see vested their money in slaves, relying upon
the pledges and promises of the Government
to protect them in it. Really, sir, it does seem
to me to be most remarkable that wc do not
only disregard the pledge of the Federal Gov-
ernment, but they also require the State of
Tennessee to violate her own pledges made to
her own people.
But, Mr. Speaker, it is not my purpose to-
day to discuss the important subject of the
restoration of the seceded States further than
I have done. My object is to ask attention to
another subject of perhaps but little less im-
portance. It is, sir, to one of the most im-
portant sources to whicli we are to look for
revenue to enable us to meet the vast demand
that is now continually pressing upon us in the
item of interest, as well as to supply the ordi-
nary demands of the Government, and ultimately
to pay the enormous debt that we now owe.
To be more explicit, it is my purpose to speak
of the agricultural interest of the country, and
to show, if I can, the difference in the different
systems of labor as practiced in this country
heretofore, and what may be expected from the
laborers now in portions of this country under
the system of labor now being inaugurated.
Sir, the agricultural interest of this country is
one of far more importance than any other one
interest, and perhaps of many others put to-
gether, and if the agriculturists should fail for
only a few years together, our whole country
would be ruined, and no other interest or branch
of industry could save us; but let the agricul-
turists succeed, and with proper legislation the
country is safe. Now, sir, if this be true, wc
see at once the great necessity of fostering and
protecting that important and worthy class of
our fellow-citizens.
Sir, in making our calculations for revenue
to meet the vast demands against us, it will not
do for us to suppose that the revenue from the
States heretofore known as slave States will be
increased by this great and sudden destruction
of slave labor, but that the products of those
States will be greatly diminished, and to the
extent of that diminution must be the increase
of taxation in the free States. The Govern-
ment, therefore, must look to the free States to
make up the deficiency caused by the destruc-
tion of slave labor in the former slave States.
I know, sir, that this statement, if true, dis-
proves the truth of an assertion long and loudly
made by a certain class of politicians in our
country, to wit, that free or hired labor is more
profitable than slave labor, and in order to
Erove this assertion to be true, a comparison
as often been made between the Stales of
Ohio and Kentucky, Ohio being, a free State
and using free labor, and Kentucky slave labor.
Tlw argument is that as Ohio has a larger pop-
ulation and makes more in the aggregate than
Kentucky, therefore free labor is more profit-
able than slave labor. I suppose, however,
that the hard-working farmer iu Ohio would
not be much comforted by a knowledge of the
fact that his State made more in the aggregate
than the State of Kentucky if he is at the same
time informed of the additional fact that each
individual—white, free colored, and slave—in
the State of Kentucky did make more on an
average than did each individual in the State
of Ohio. What gratification can it afford to
a citizen of Ohio to know that his neighbor-
hood is very densely populated, and that be-
cause of that fact, together with the difference
in their system of labor, that he makes less on
an average than does each individual in the
State of Kentucky?
To prove that this is true, I beg to call the
attention of this House and of the country to
that most valuable document, the Eighth Cen-
sus, made in 1860. By an examination of that
document it will be found that the State of
Ohio had in 1860 a population of—
Whites 2,302,838
Freo colored persons  3(5,6.3
Total 2,339,511
The assessed value of real estate and personal
property in Ohio was $959,807,101. The aver-
age value of property assessed in Ohio, to each
individual, white and free colored, is about
$410.
Kentucky had of—
Whites  919,517
Free eolorcd persons  10,684
Slaves  225,483
Total   yOo.OSl
The assessed %'alue of real estate and personal
property in Kentucky was 2. G03! mak-
ing an average to each individual, white, free
colored, and slave, of about $457 ; and if made
to each white and free colored person, the aver-
age is about $507 to each one.
To ascertain which had the most profitable
system of labor, the people of Ohio, or those
of Kentucky, I deem it necessary only to call
attention to the most important products raised
in each State, and estimate their value, and
make the average to each person, thus:
In Ohio in 1869:
Wheat raised, 14,532,570 bu., at $1 ?il>u  614,533,570
Corn, 70,637,1-10 bu., at50ets. " ... 35,318,570

Value of live stock, including horses,
mules, and asses, milch cows, working
oxen, other cattle, sheep, and swine  80.433,7S9
Total value ,gl38,935,929
This gives on an average to each person in
the State of Ohio about $59.
In Kentucky in 1869:
Wheat raised, 7,391,811 bu„ at $1 <£  bu  $7,394,811
Corn, 64,043,633 bu., at 50 cts."  32,0j:1,8o6

Oats, 4,617,0-9 bu.. at 53 cts."  2,308,514
Rice, 24,407 lbs, at 10 ets. lb... 2,440
Tobacco, 108,102,437 lbs, at 10 els. ¥« lb... 10,810,243
Cotton, 4,092 bale', at 10 ets. v>

Yalue ol live stock, including horses,
mules, asses, milrh cows, working oxen,
other cattle, sheep, and swine  61.863,237
Total value .S115,625,053
This gives an average to each person in the
State of Kentucky, including slaves, of about,
$100; and if the average is made only among
the white and free colored persons, the amount
to each one would be about $125, more than
double the amount made to each person in
Ohio, the people of Ohio making only $50 to
each person. But to test this matter further,
we will take the most important of the prod-
ucts of the States of Tennessee and Indiana :
The State of Indiana has a population of— 
White persons l,,v>9.000
Free colored persons  11.1L8
Total ! 1,350,428
The assessed value of real estate and per-
sonal property was iti 1860, $411,042,424; mak-
ing an average to each person in the State of
about $805.
The population of the State of Tennessee
was—
White  826,783
Free colored peisons   7,300
Slaves  275,719
Total population .* 1,109,801
The assessed value of real estate and per-
sonal property in the State of Tennessee was
in 1860 $382,495,209. The average value to
each _ person including slaves is about $343,
and it the average is made only among the
white and free colored persons it will be found
to be about $45.) to each one, against $305 to
each person in the State of Indiana.
Mr. KELLEY. Arc all the people of Ken-
tucky embraced in that calculation—slaves and
all?
Mr. RITTER. Every one; white people,
free colored people, and slaves; if there are any
other kinds there, if the gentleman will point
them out, I will include them.
Mr. KELLEY. And the property equals
$500 to each one of them?
Mr. RITTER. Three hundred and forty-
three dollars to each.
Mr. KELLEY. Slaves and all?
Mr. RITTER. Yes, sir; if you exclude the
slaves it will be $459 to each.
In Indiana in 1860:
Wheat raised 15,219,120 bu., at SI "i1. bu  $15,219,120
Rye, 400.226 bu., at {-1 "  400,226

Yalueof live stock, including horses,mules.
asses, milch cows, working oxen, other
cattle, sheep, and swine  50,116,964
Total value $103,796,105
This makes an average to each person in the
State of Indiana of about $77.
The products of Tennessee in 1800 were as
follows :
Wheat raised, 5,409,863 bu., at $1 ^bu...... $5,409,863
Rye, 265,314 bu., at 81 "  265,344
Corn, 50,748,266 bu., at 50 cts."  25,374,133
Oats. 2,343.122 bu., at 50 cts."  1,171.561
Tobacco, 38,931.277 lbs, at 10 cts  3,893,127
Cotton, 227,450 bales, counted at
400 lbs. H bale and 20 ets. ft, is  9,093.000
Live stock, including horses, mules, and
asses, milch cows, woiking oxen, other
cattle, sheep, and swine..  61,257,374
Total value $105,469,402
This makes an average to each person in
the State of Tennessee, including slaves, of
$05. And if the average is made between
the white and free colored person only, it is
about $127 to each person, against $77 to
each person in the State of Indiana.
But as it may be thought that a comparison
between these four States is not sufficient to
satisfy every one. wc will go still further, and
introduce the great and rich State of Illinois
and compare it with the State of Alabama.
The population of the State of Illinois was
I in I860:
| White persons   1,704,323
| Colored persons  '."28
Total : Ull.OOl
The assessed value of real estate and per-
sonal properly was 207,872. This makes
an average value, to each person in the State
of about $22],
The population of the State of Alabama was

The assessed value of property, real estate
and personal, was in 1800 $482,198,76-, mak-

average is made between the wln-e^ and tree
colored persons of the State only, it will be
