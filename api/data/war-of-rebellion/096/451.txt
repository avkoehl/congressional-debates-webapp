hold all your available men ready to support or aid, him, if called upon by him. A company of the Pennsylvania cavalry is now with General Smyth; will your order it back if not necessary?

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 7, 1865-11.15 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,February 7, 1865-7 p. m.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

General Warren threw forward Crawford's right to clear the enemy from the angle they held opposite Armstrong's Mill, and requested me to give him the benefit of artillery fire, which I did. I have not heard from him since, but take it for granted he effected what he wished, which was desirable for him and me.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,February 7, 1865-12.35 p. m.

General WARREN:

GENERAL: I am directed to support you with my available force, in the event of your requiring the same, and have ready in reserve for that purpose De Trobriand's and West's brigades, the first, 2,300 strong and the second 1,700.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.

FEBRUARY 7, 1865-12.45 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Commanding Second Army Corps:

GENERAL: I am directed by Major-General Warren to send you the inclosed copy of a dispatch from General Meade.* Crawford is pushing the enemy out toward Dabney's Mill, but General Warren desires to know if you cannot use some artillery to fire over in the direction of the enemy, more for the moral effect it will produce on our own troops than anything else.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRED T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
