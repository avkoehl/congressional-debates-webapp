COLONEL: I have the honor to request the transfer of the Tennessee brigade (late Bushrod Johnson's) to my brigade. The Tennesseeans of my command who are anxious for this transfer, and have asked me to apply for, it assure me that it is equally the desire of Bushrod Johnson's brigade. Johnson's brigade in on provost duty in Richmond.

Brigadier-General.

HEADQUARTERS HETH'S DIVISION,August 27, 1864.

Respectfully forwarded and recommended to the favorable consideration of the general commanding. I suggest that Walker's old brigade be put on the duty Johnson's brigade now performs. Walker's brigade is much reduced, and being a Virginia brigade, stationary and near their homes, would fill up. It numbers now 600 men for duty.

Respectfully,

H. HETH,

Major-General.
