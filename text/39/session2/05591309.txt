KENNEDY o'liKIEN.
On motion of Mr. LANE, the bill (S. No.
5)2) for the relief of Kennedy O'Brien was
read a second time, and considered as in Com-
mittee of the Whole. It directs the Secretary
of the Interior to increase the jjensiou of Ken-
nedy O'Brien, late a private in company K,
fifth regiment Indiana volunteers, from eight
dollars per month to twenty-five dollars per
month.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I should like to know
why that increase is proposed to be made.
This is getting rather common here to increase
pensions from eight to twenty-five dollars a
month. It is a large increase.
Mr. LANE. The report, accompanying the
bill shows the facts in this case. _ This man
was placed on the pension-roll at eight dollars
a month. He was totally blind in both eyes.
If he had been placed on the pension-roll
under the general law he would have been
entitled to twenty-five dollars. When he came
before the committee we were perfectly satis-
fied about the case. He was led in by a one-
legged soldier, and was totally blind. Having
been placed on the pension-list by a special
law he cannot obtain this increase except by
another special law.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Are all those who are
blind entitled to receive twenty-five dollars?
Mr. LANE. Yes, sir; all those who are
blind in both eyes.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Very well; I do not
object. .
The bill was reported to the Senatc.,without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a
third reading, read the third time, and passed.
PATRICK MEEIIAN.
On motion of Mr. LANE, the bill (S. No.
613) granting a pension to Patrick^Meehan,
was read the second time, and considered as
in Committee of the W'hole. It directs the
Secretary of the Interior to place the name or
Patrick Meehan, late a corporal in company i,
eighty-ninth regiment Indiana volunteers, on
the pension-roll, at the rate of fifteen dollars
per month, to commence from the 6th of June,
Mr. FESSENDEN. I should like to have
the honorable Senator explain these various
rates. I do not understand why one is placed
at twenty-five dollars, another at fifteen dol-
lars, another at eight dollars, &c. We ought
to have some rules in reference to all these
things, and not leave them as a mere matter
of discretion. â€ž
Mr. LANE. There is no discretion lett to
anybody. _ There is a general law placing
these pensions at different rates. A rpan who
has lost one leg or one arm, or both legs or
both arms, or one eye or both eyes, has a dif-
ferent pension and a higher one than a man
who is simply disabled and only gets eight dol-
lars a month.
M. FESSENDEN. What is the reason, if
this man comes under the general law, that he
* get his pension at the pension office ?
Mr. LANE. The reason is this : the Com-
missioner of Pensions has decided that where
a_man is placed on t.he pension-roll by a spe-
cial law, he cannot increase his pension under
our general law unless we pass an act. of Con-
gress saying that it shall be done. These rates
have been provided for by general law. This
man would have been placed at this rate by
the general law ; but this is a special law which
is necessary to meet his case under the decis-
ion of the Commissioner. The report will
show the facts. I ask the Secretary to read
the report, which will show just how it stands.
Mr. ^FESSENDEN. I understand it. 1
only wished an explanation of the principle.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading, read the third time, and passed.
