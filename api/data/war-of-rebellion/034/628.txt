Report of Brigadier General Samuel, P. Carter, U. S. Army.

SOMERSET, KY., June 30, 1863.

GENERAL: I have dispatches from Colonel Wolford to 3 p. m. yesterday. The force sent after rebels in direction of Columbia encountered about 60 of them near that place, and dispersed them, capturing 2. The party sent to Creelsborough met some 50 rebels; killed 1 and captured 2 of Duke's regiment. Five rebel regiments are reported between Horseshoe Bottom and Rowena, on south side of river, but nothing certain is known of their force. It is supposed not more than 250 rebels are north of river. The river will not be fordable in much less than a week If forage cannot be obtained in Russell County, Colonel Kautz will be ordered to return to this place, leaving Colonel Wolford at Jamestown.
