Total amount 1.160,450
Now, sir, that amount, at three cents postage,
would be $34,813 50. That is the amount of
postage which Senators have exhausted during
the last session of Congress, in these political
pamphlets and speeches, over and above the
amount of written correspondence upon which
they put their frank; and, for the last Congress,
three million and eighty thousand documents.
The amount of postage consumed for the Senate
alone has been §92,400. 1 think a good deal could
be saved, at least in the weight of carrying the
mails through the country, if this abuse is cut
off; and it will be effectually cut off by abolishing
the franking privilege, even although you may
substitute postage stamps, according to my prop-
osition, in lieu of the franking privilege. To show
the extraordinary amount of documents that have
been received at the folding-room of the Senate
alone, to say nothing of the House of Represent-
atives, I will read the following list, for the year
1857, prepared for me by the superintendent of
the folding-room:

JOSEPH I1EDRICK,
Superintendent Senate Folding-Room.
December 35, 1858.
I apprehend, if the franking privilege be abol-
ished, that the mails will not be lumbered with
the vast amount of incumbrance and weight
which has been the consequence of the system
heretofore pursued; and when you relieve the
mails of this vast amount of mail matter which
the abolishing of the franking; privilege will pre-
vent, I apprehend the Post Oitice Department will
be able to make better contracts on the part of til e
Government for the transportation of the mail.
There is a saving in that. But if Senators desire
tn send out speeches, as doubtless many of them
will, let them pay for this political information
which they send out for the benefit of their con-
stituents and for their own benefit. I see no rea-
son why the Government of the United States
should pay the expense of these political elec-
tioneering documents which gentlemen send out
to their constituents for the purpose of affecting
public opinion, either in their own behalf, or in
behalf of their friends. If a member of Congress
makes a speech upon tins floor, or in the other
branch of Congress, which is one of political or
personal importance, if it be of such a character
as to entitle it to be distributed amongst the peo-
ple, the public press of the country will spread it
before the people. If a speech be made upon this
floor which deserves to go amongst the people, it
will be disseminated through the public press,
either of the State or district which the member
represents. There is no kind of necessity or use
in publishing, at the expense of the Government,
this vast number of political speeches to be sent
out and distributed amongst the people, only to
be read and thrust into the fire, in nine cases out
of ten.
I want to know, sir, what is the excuse for
printing all these various documents r There may
be some reason for publishing a few of the Pres-
ident's message and accompanying documents,
which are sent in at the commencement of eiich
annual session of Congress; but why publish this
vast amount ? If the members of Congress were
compelled to pay thepostage upon them, no more
would be ordered than were necessary and proper
for the use of the Senate itself, to carry on its legis-
lative functions. The President's message is pub-
lished 111 every paper m the United States, and
circulated m every log hut in the country long
before we strike off copies of these immense vol-
umes which you publish at the national expense.
These very documents, which weigh eight or ten
pounds each, and which weigh down the mails,
and increase the expense of the Post Office De-
partment, are only sent out to be laid aside by
those who receive them, and never to look at them;
perhaps not one man in a thousand ever exam-
ines a page of them. They have already seen
the message and documents which are interest-
ing to them, published in the newspapers. They
have read them; and long since, perhaps, forgot-
ten their contents. The abolition of the franking
privilege will^ stop all this extravagant expendi-
ture; and I think, although I differ from ray friend
from North Carolina in my opinion, that the abo-
lition of the franking privilege will, through these
various ways and these various avenues, save not
less than from two to five million dollars annually.
That is my candid and honest opinion; that it will
save not less than two millions, and may proba-
bly go up to five millions.
Then, sir, I desire to know of the Senator from
North Carolina, or anybody else who thinks with
him, whether the abolition of the franking privi-
lege, even although you give to members of Con-
gress $150 in stamps, is not likely to save a very
large amountofpubhcexpenditure;andnotonlydo
that, but stop a very great abuse? 1 think it proper
that, at this session of Congress, we should abol-
ish the privilege in anticipation of the next pres-
idential election, in order to put a stop to that ex-
travagant abuse which has heretofore existed in
sending out from this Capitol documents folded,
and many of them printed, at the public expense,
to effect political objects amongst the people.
Mr.PUGH. I wish to ask the Senator whether
he says these speeches are printed at the public
expense?
Mr. IVERSON. No, sir.
Mr.PUGH. I so understood the Senator. I
paid for all 1 sent. I thought the Senator was
laboring under a mistake.
Mr. IVERSON. Certainly I did not say th.it
speeches of members were published at the ex-
pense of the Government.
Mr. YULEE. They were folded and trans-
ported.
Mr. IVERSON. The folding and transporta-
tion of them through the mails is at the Govern-
ment expense. That, of course, is borne by the
public; and I say it is an abuse of the Iranking
privilege.
I There is another reason why I desire to abolish
the franking privilege. It is to stop that annoy-
ance and fraud which is practiced upon members
of Congress through friends who come to us and
ask us to frank papers and letters. I apprehend
that no member of the Senate who has any ex-
perience, but what will say, that during every
session of Congress, and even in the vacation, he
has applications from individuals and friends to
frank their letters and papers for them. It is a
j delicate matter to refuse them, although in viola-
! tion of law; and not one member in a hundred
! refuses these applications.
Mr. MASON. The Senator will allow me ta
say that I trust no such application was ever
listened to.
JVJ r. IVERSON. Well, sir, I will not pretend
to respond to that. I do not know whether they
were or not. The Senator can answer for him-
self. I venture to say that there is no Senator,
unless a Senator like the Senator from Virginia,
who is wrapped up in such impenetrable dignity
that no one can ever approach him, [laughter,]
but what has had applications of that sort.
Mr. MASON. I do not know what the opinion
of that honorable Senator may be of dignity, and
I will not go into the inquiry; hutl repeat, I trust
if any such application was ever made to a Sena-
tor, that it was not listened to.
Mr. IVERSON. I have no doubt, although X
will not say I speak from personal knowledge,
that such applications are made, and have been
listened to, and attended to frequently. At any
rate, if the franking privilege is abolished, then
no such applications will be made, bccause no
man will be so shameless as to come and ask a
Senator or Representative to give him three cents
to pay his postage upon his letter. But when the
franking privilege exists, these constituents and
friends think they are entitled to have their letters
and papers franked by members of Congress.
This abuse takes away, in my opinion, a great
deal ofthe just and legitimate revenues of the Post
Office Department, which are thus defrauded and
