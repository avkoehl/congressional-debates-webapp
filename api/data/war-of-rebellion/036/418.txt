FORT PEMBERTON, April 2, 1863.

(Received April 3-10 a. m.)

The enemy are sending their boats to the Pass for re-enforcements. They are receiving heavy guns. Can any heavy guns be sent here?

JACKSON, April 3, 1863.

Major-General LORING,

Fort Pemberton, via Grenada:

I am expecting more heavy guns, but have none now to lend you.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

FORT PEMBERTON, April 3, 1863.

The enemy got another large re-enforcement to-day, at least 3,000. This fight, from the preparations making by the enemy, will be desperate. I therefore think we should have an additional quantity of ammunition sent at once for our guns. We are compelled to use our shot to prevent the enemy erecting batteries in our front, and I will cover the amount by requisition. Send one hundred rockets.

W. W. LORING,

Major-General.

Lieutenant General J. C. PEMBERTON.

FORT PEMBERTON, April 4, 1863.

On the 1st and 2nd, seventeen transports loaded with troops came down the river, and passed a point 100 miles above; have no doubt arrived here. Can you send us intrenching tools?

W. W. LORING,

Major-General.

Lieutenant General J. C. PEMBERTON.

FORT PEMBERTON, April 5, 1863,

(Received April 6.)

The enemy commenced embarking last night at 10 o'clock, and before day this morning were in rapid retreat, after re-enforcing yesterday 10,000 men. Having our works strengthened, we commenced shelling their camps and transports, and kept it up for two days and at intervals during the night.
