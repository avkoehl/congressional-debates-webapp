Major General C. W. FIELD,

Commanding Division:

General Longstreet now wishes all of your troops to go by rail. Transportation will be furnished as soon as possible. After the first two have gotten off or one the cars. I will notify you when to start the third, fourth, and fifth brigades. Anderson's will be the last to leave and will remain till Ewell comes up.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,April 1, 1865.

Major General C. W. FIELD,

Commanding Division:

General Ewell telegraphs that one battalion of troops (the Hospital Battalion), 800 strong, is on its way out now; that the Local troops will not be out before to-morrow morning. Anderson's brigade will await the arrival of the Local troops. The Texas brigade and Law's brigade can move at the time indicated in my last note. It is important beyond measure hat no time be lost. All of your transportation and officers' horses can go by road across the Wilton bridge, though if the officers prefer to send their horses by road leading from Richmond, well and good.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,April 1, 1865.

Major-General FIELD,

Commanding, &c.:

You will start Law's and the Texas brigades into Richmond for the Petersburg depot, exactly five hours after the first two brigades started. At that time they will find transportation waiting for them. Anderson's brigade will remain on the line until Ewell comes up, when he will go to the depot. When General Gary relieves part of your pickets they will follow on to the railroad depot to rejoin their brigades, and when General Ewell relieves the rest they will do the same.

Respectfully, &c.,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
