C. S. ENGINEER DEPARTMENT,

Charleston, May 24, 1864.

The party went down this morning, with four torpedoes for the Stono, to consult with General Taliaferro. Others will be sent as soon as these are located. Another party is at Battery Haskell locating them in creeks opposite that battery.

Respectfully,

W. H. ECHOLS,

Major.

ROYALL'S, May 23, 1864-11.15 p. m.

Captain FEILDEN:

Colonel Simonton just reports that he cannot make out what the enemy are about. He thinks it important that Keitt's regiment should be retained. Colonel Brown, from Secessionville, telegraphs enemy had just opened from three points on our picket-line, and signal rockets are being sent up from enemy's headquarters. I have, therefore, ordered Keitt to the front.

WM. B. TALIAFERRO,

Brigadier-General.

SAVANNAH, May 23, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

As Johnston has retired south of the Etowah, giving the enemy North Georgia and North Alabama, Sherman may be content to hold the ground gained, and thus be able to re-enforce Grant. Cannot torpedoes be put in the Rappahannock?

J. F. GILMER,

Major-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., May 23, 1864.

Major General J. F. GILMER,

Savannah, Ga.:

Order Colonel R. H. Anderson to proceed, without delay, with his regiment by highway, via Atlanta, Ga., and report to General J. E. Johnston.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

RICHMOND, VA., May 24, 1864.

General SAMUEL JONES,

Charleston, S. C.:

The First Georgia Regiment, Colonel Olmstead, will proceed, with the greatest possible expedition, by railroad, via Atlanta, Ga., and report to General J. E. Johnston, commanding Army of Tennessee.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
