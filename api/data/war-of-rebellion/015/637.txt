HARPER'S FERRY, VA.

June 1, 1862.

I have many reports of heavy firing to-day on the east side of the Blue Ridge. I have reliable information that on Thursday Jackson had ordered his army to storm this place, but the shells from our batteries were so destructive that he drew back out of their range and endeavored to draw us out to attack him.

R. SAXTON,

Brigadier-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON.

WASHINGTON, June 1, 1862.

Brigadier-General SAXTON,

Harper's Ferry:

Your dispatch announcing that the enemy has not reappeared is received. Make a reconnaissance as far as Charleston to ascertain whether the enemy is there or thereabouts. See that the reconnoitering force maintains strict discipline. Let couriers report the progress and discoveries of the reconnaissance from time to time to your headquarters, and forward the reports here promptly by telegraph.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War

My scouts, who have just come in from Charleston, bring a rumor that Jackson is falling back from Winchester before the advance of our forces. There has been heavy firing there. I shall send out a strong reconnaissance.

R. SAXTON,

Brigadier-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, VA., June 1, 1862.

A reconnaissance commanded by Captain Cole, which was sent to Charleston has just returned. Scoured the country on both sides of the road. No signs of the enemy. The inhabitants say the rebel force, 15,000 strong, retreated in great haste yesterday morning. Captain Cole reports have firing in the direction of Winchester. Our forces are undoubtedly there.

R. SAXTON,

Brigadier-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,
