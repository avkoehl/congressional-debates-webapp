cm theiT voyages between the American edast,!
and the Asiatic coast. It-does not require for- I
tification. It may never require,fortification.' j
In time of war unquestionably we should yield j
it, because a coaling station between this coun- j
try and the Asiatic coast is not necessary then.1 j
It is for time of peace, for cotnmerce, for the i
use of the Navy, for our whaling vessels, that j
we require this convenience at this time. i
Mr. BUTLEH, of Massachusetts. I would
ask my colleague what sort of a thing an un- j
fortified Gibraltar would be? ' |
Mr. BANKS. I have no occasion to answer ;
that question. Because Gibraltar is a fortified
place this would not be required to be. Gib-
raltar commands the mouth of the Mediterra-
nean sea, and we have no such necessity here >
Then in regard to the title to this island
something ought to be said in reply to my col-
league, who say^ the title is not complete
because the vessel that discovered this island
floated the Hawaiian flag. The ship's papers
settle the question, and they were the papers
of an American vessel, commanded by an
American officer, manned by American sea-
men, sailing on an American voyage. • It Was,
therefore, the discovery of American seamen,
and it is the property of the Government, for
it ha^ taken possession of this island.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. HIGBY. I rise to a parliamentary ques-
tion. Would not a motion to concur in the
amendment of the Senate take precedence ?•
The CHAIRMAN. The question is on con-
curring.
Mr. HIGBY. The Committee on Appro-
priations recommend a non-concurrence. I
desire to move to concur.

anyway.

The Committee on Appropriations- recom-
mend non-cpncurrence.
The amendments were non-concurred.in.
.Jir. SPALDING. I move that these amend-
ments of the Senate be laid aside for the pres-
ent, to be, reported hereafter to the House.
Mr.. SCOFIELD. I move to amend that
motion, so that the Committee of the Whole
shall now rise, a-nd report these Senftte.atnend-
ments to the House. - X make that in quo u be-
cause tbere'was another gentleujah in the chair,
the. gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. Sobekck,]
tfben the legislative appropriation, bill was
before under consideration in Committee of
the Whole; and it will be necessary for the
committee to rise to get him in the chair again
on that bill, ...
The motion ,of Mr. ScofxElb was agreed to.,
The committee accordingly rose-; and the
Speaker having resumed the chair, Mr. Pome-
eot reported that the Committee of tie Whole,
pursuant to- order, had bad under considera-
tion the amendments of the Senate to Housfe
, bill No. 1599, making appropriations for the
naval Service for the year "ending June SO,
1870, and had directed hiitf to report the stone
back to the House with a recommendation that
some of the amendments be conCurfed in and
others non-concurred in.
Mr. SPALDING. I call the previous ques-
tion on the amendments of the Senate.
The previous question was seconded'and the
main question ordered.
LEGISLATIVE, ETC., APPTtOPIHitTlON BILL
Mr. BJJTLEft, of Massachusetts. I- move
that the rales be suspended and the House now
resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole,
upon the legislative appropriation bill.
The motion was agreed to.
The House .accordingly resolved itself into
the Committee of the A^ihole on the state of the
Union, (Mr. Schenck in the chair,) and re-
sumed the consideration of House bill No.
1673, making appropriations for the legislative,
executive, and judicial expenses of the Govern-
meutforthe year ending the SOrhof June, 1S70.
The CHAIRMAN. When this bill was last
under consideration in Committeeof the Whole,
the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Phelps]
moved to amend it by striking out the following
clause:
For newspapers and stationery for two hundred
and thirty-three members and Delegates, at $'125
eaeb per annum, 129,125.
The question is upon agreeing to the amend-
ment of the ge'ntleKian from Maryland.
Mr. PHELPS. It is not necessary for me to
recapitulate the argument, made when this sub-
ject was last under consideration. I will merely
say this is an entirely unnecessary expense, and
it is no w time that it was stopped ; for whatever
arguments may have been urged in past times
for any such appropriations as this, still at the
present time, in view of the large national debt,
in view of the necessity for economy, which is
concurred in on all sides. I think the amend-
ment I have moved should be agreed to.'
The question was taken ; and upon a divis-
ion there were—ayes lo, noes 80: no quorum
voting.
Tellers .were ordered ; and Mr. Phelps and
Mr. Ixgebsoll were appointed.
The committee again divided: and the tellers
reported that there were—ayes 22, noes 9-fc
So the amendment was not agreed to.
The Clerk read as follows:
For the public printing, $400,009.
Mr. BROOKS. I move to amend this bill
by striking out the last'clause read by the Clerk,
j l 'do not know what I ought to say in regard to
! this matter of public printing further than to
i say that we have in this city the largest pruit-
1 in«■ establishment on earth; an establishment
1 which eclipses anything of the kind in the city
i of New York, or even on the continent of
1 Europe. The expenses of the printing of this
Government have becotfio so frightful that itti
time they should arrest the attention of m#M-
bew'ln this House-, -£ hold in. my hand a-sfate
ment of appropriations made by Congress on
aeeount of public printing and binding fron|
1861 io 1868, including'cotft of the Government'
Printing Office, and what do members think
those appropriations amount to?- I' do not
believe any member of this House can begin
to guess the amount, although it will be seen
by examination that nearly one million two
hundred thousand dol'ar.s are appropriated by
this bill. I call special attention to the fol'
lowing-.

The total amounts to almost as much as -was
expended for the entire expenses of the G-ov- -
ernroent tinder the administration of John
Adams, which was repudiated for its extrava-
gance and corruption.
And what has" been the expenses from 1881
to 1868 for printing the bonds of the United
States and the Treasury notes issued by the
Government? Lhies anybody have any idea
what that has cost? Ido not believe any mem-
ber of this House can guess within $1,000,000.
