HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 16, 1862.

Brigadier General R. INGALLS,

Chief Quartermaster, Washington, D. C.:

I have notified the corps quartermasters that they can obtain clothing at Harper's Ferry. By to-morrow night I can form some definite idea of the quantity required, of which I will notify you. Send forward some drums. I have been informed that horses can be purchased in Fulton County. If it meets your approval, I would suggest that Captain Gerker, assistant quartermaster, with at least two good cavalry officers, be sent to that county to purchase. Everything all right here, so far as we are concerned.

Lieutenant-colonel and Quartermaster.

General FITZ JOHN PORTER,

Commanding Fifth Army Corps, Sharpsburg, Md.:

Colonel Ingalls telegraphs me from Washington, this morning, that large lot of clothing will be shipped to-day to Harper's Ferry. At least 10,000 suits, 20,000 blankets, and 10,000 shelter-tents were ordered from New York some time ago, and should soon be at Harper's Ferry. Shoes, &amp;c., will leave to-day, in charge of a special messenger. Should you not have received what clothing you asked for, I would advise you to send wagons to Harper's Ferry for it to-morrow. I have no doubt the greater part of it will be there then.

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.
