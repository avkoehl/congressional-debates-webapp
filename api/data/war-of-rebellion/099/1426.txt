General R. E. LEE:

The troops will be united to-day, except two divisions of Cheatham's corps not yet arrived. Effective totals, infantry and artillery: Bragg, 6,500; Hardee, 7,500; Army of Tennessee, 4,000. Should Sherman move by Weldon would you prefer my turning to Clarksville? Lieutenant-General Hrdee's loss on 16th was 450. Prisoners taken the next day report the enemy's about 3,300.

RALEIGH, March 18, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN M. OTEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: Upon the Wilmington and Weldon, the Petersburg, and the Seaboard and Roanoke Railroads tere are probably nineteen efficient locomotives and 150 cars. These are engaged in transportation upon their respective roads and, to a certain extent, in assisting the Raleigh and Gaston Railroad. Their services are necessary for collecting the supplies of the sections of country into which they lead, which supplies are eventually forwarded to the Army of Northern Virginia, except so far as necessary for the support of the cavalry stationed in the vicinity of Stony Creek. If the enemy occupy Raleigh this equipment would be in great danger if he moves in the direction of Weldon. The consideration of the question as to the orders I am to give to the superintendents of these several roads I respectfully submit to the commanding general.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN M. ROBINSON,

Military Superintendent of Railroads.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS, &amp;C.,Raleigh, N. C., March 21, 1865.

Respectfully referred to General Jos. E. Johnston for his orders.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.
