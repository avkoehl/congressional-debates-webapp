I have gathered the following information with regard to the dirt road from Vicksburg: Between Vicksburg and Richmond, low, flat land; roads in dry weather good; four bridges. Between Richmond and Tensas Bayou, low land, subject to overflow; roads in rainy weather almost impassable for teams. Between Tensas Bayou and Ioes Bayou, low lands; about half the distance swampy. Between Ioes Bayou and Bayou Macon, low lands subject to overflow. Between Bayou Macon and Boeuf River, about 4 miles of high lands. Between Boeuf River and Lake La Fourche, about half the distance low land; two bridges, one over a large creek. Between Lake La Fourche and Monroe, about 4 miles of low lands. Between Monroe and Minden, country high, hilly, and sandy. Between Minden and Shreveport, low lands for a short distance beyond Minden, thence high land to Red River bottoms, near Shreveport. I think it probable I may be able to procure more detailed information, and perhaps more reliable; if so, I shall keep you informed.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General CANBY,

Commanding Division of West Mississippi:

GENERAL: General Birge, who belongs to this corps, and who was directed by Special Orders, Numbers 135, paragraph 9, of May 24, to report here for duty, has not done so. I am informed that he is at Carrollton, possibly on some detached service. His presence here with his command is absolutely necessary, and I have deemed it of sufficient importance to send down a staff officer, with this communication to you, to request that he may be ordered to rejoin his command as speedily as possible.

I have heretofore omitted to call attention to the regular batteries in this command. With Battery C there is no officer. With Battery L there are 2 officers. With Battery F there is 1 officer, and
