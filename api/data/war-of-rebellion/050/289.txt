command they took into the fight, with the exception of 2 officers and 32 men. The noble conduct off these officers and regiments greatly augments the loss. I feel greatly indebted to all of my regimental commanders for their gallant bearing, and the hearty support they have rendered me during these days of trial. Colonel Moore, commanding Thirty-third Ohio Volunteer Infantry, and Lieutenant-Colonel Griffin, commanding Thirty-eighth Indiana, are worthy of especial praise. I would also commend the gentlemen of my staff for the faithful performance of their arduous duties. Lieutenant George Devol, acting assistant adjutant-general; Lieutenant Kelso, acting commissary of subsistence; and Lieutenant Bird, acting assistant quartermaster, are worthy of especial praise. Lieutenant Hollister, aide-de-camp, was thrown from his horse and seriously disabled early in action in the faithful performance of his duties.

I went into action on the morning of the 19th instant with 120 officers and 1,759 men, and came out with 70 officers and 872 men; a loss of 50 officers and 887 men in killed, wounded, and prisoners.* For their names and for further particulars I would respectfully refer to the accompanying papers.+
