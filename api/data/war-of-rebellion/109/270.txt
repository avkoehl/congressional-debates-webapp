All quiet along our whole line during the past twenty- four hours. Train in from the east. No detention of obstruction on the road. Colonel Roberts has taken command of the First Birgade.

Were unsuccessful. He has no doubt gone south. His plantation is in our possession, and overseer under arrest.
