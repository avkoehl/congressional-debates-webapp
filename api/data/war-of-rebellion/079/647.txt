Colonel Gallup, of General Schofield's corps, had arrived at Johnsonville about 3 p. m. to-day with 1,000 men, and General Schofield, with whole portion of his troops, went down this afternoon, and the whole corps will be there as soon as possible.

Major-General THOMAS:

I have just made out your cipher dispatch of yesterday. Bad for the gun-boats. I would not advise you to send too large a force to Johnsonville, as there cannot be anything but Forrest's cavalry there. Send some heavier guns and some re-enforcement, but keep your main force in hand till Beauregard develops his plans. I am delayed here by the
