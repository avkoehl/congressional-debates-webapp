look at the law-, a=i they now tand, and he shou'd m t km^
thi=? view, attune that all the ae s passed by the House of Re
pre^ertauves would become laws, they not having been reject
ed by the other House
Mr F here took a view of the efflcts of the compromise
act m the course of which be said that by that act one tenth
of the customs over  twentvfive per cenf ad valorem was to
come off on the 1st January, 1834, and on the 1st January, 1836,
another tenth was to be deducted, on the 1st January, 1838
another tenth, and on the 1st January, ISlOjanother tenth, and
on the 1st Jl uaiy, 1842, three tenths more, and on the 1st
July, 1842, the jemaining three tenths were to be deducted, so
that, on that day, what was usually termed the compiormee
act was to go fully into effect, and reduce the revenue to 20 per
cent ad valorem on all articles imported into the country It
appeared from a íeport submitted to this House, (he meant the
financial report of the Secretary of the Tieasury, docuuientNo.
2 page 29,) si owing the amount of imports for the seven years
fiom 1834 to 1840 inclusive, that there were imported into thus
country one hundied and forty one million four hundred a«ds&,
venty si* thousand seven hundred and sixty nine dollars worth
o*" goods, of which seventy one million seven hundred and
twenty eight thousand three hundred and twelve dollars were
fiee of"duty, and sixty nine millions seven hundred and forty-
pight thousand four hundred and fifty seven dollars paid duty
Then, having theseamounts, and knowing that, by the compro 
trmeaGt, articles paying duty over 20 per ct and many of them
paid moie, were to be reduced down to (hat standard, and all
were to pay only 20 per cent what would be the amount of re
venue fiom thusuuice? Why, its gross amount would only
be thirteen millions nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars in
loundnumbeis—that is, taking the average of goods imported
11 the last seven jeai'j, the whole gross amount of duty that
would pa°s intu the Treasury, tha ail the imported articles pay
the highest rate of duty, would only be thirteen, millions time
hundred and fid four thousand dollars* say fourteen millions
of dollar^, in íound numbers
In reply to a q icstion by Mi Habersham, Mr F said he did
did not propose to go into the average of the home valuation
as compared with the foreign valuation He was not now
speaking of the amuuntof íevenue that would be produced by
this bJJ on the < ontrary he was speaking of what we might
i easonably expect from the operation of existing laws As he
su I befoie, the u hole amount of revenue which we might cal-
culate on from the existing laws, would be only fourteen mil-
lions jn gioss Now what amount might he expected to be
paid, for expenses of collection, for arawbacks and fishing
bounties ax Now atable had been prepared at the Treasury
Depiitment exhibitingthatiesult,to which he begged leave to
cali the attentioi of the committee It was document2l, page
¿9 He would refer the committee to pages 10 and 11, for the
put pose ot showing what had been the amount of duties re*
f uuded foi the I u t six years, on drawbacks, on lefined sugar,
di tilled spnit-, and fishing bounties Now by this statement,
u appeared that the annual average of the gross duties from
1834 to 1839, wee twenty imee millions, one hundred and se-
\ enty six tl ousaul dollars There was tefunded under the de-
i ision-5 oí tne t luitti, of that sum, six hundred and seventy one
thousaid dollars theie was paid bark for drawbacks on mer

wa" ref intitd lor drawbacks on refined sugar one hundred and
forty eight thou^al dollars for drawbacks on domestic distilled
-pinu mnethousand dollars forbountiesonpickledfish seven
thousand dollars, (or fishing bounties, a little more than a quarter
of a mi'lion, and the expense of collecting this revenue was
one million four hundred and twenty two thousand dollars
All these sums to be ded icted from the gross revenue, amounted
to lour miljiois six hundred and seventy-two thousand dollars,
leaving but nine millions two hundred and seventy eight thou
