from the water near Gregg. In that case I expect a monitor in on to-morrow's high tide.

GILLMORE,

General.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, September 5, 1863-6.50 p.m.

General GILLMORE:

The Ironsides will resume fire at sunrise, unless a red light is shown by you at Gregg. High water to-morrow at 2 p.m., when an effort will be made to put a monitor close up to Gregg.

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, September 5, 1863-8.30 p.m.

General GILLMORE:

If you show a red light to-night, do you want a monitor to move up near Gregg at 2 a.m. or 2 p.m. to-morrow?

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.

MORRIS ISLAND, September 5, 1863-9 p.m.

Admiral DAHLGREN:

No red light will be shown to-night. By arrangement with Mr. Preston, two monitors were to go in as a diversion to keep off any re-enforcements while my party is at work on Gregg. The monitors need not remain after 1 o'clock.

GILLMORE,

General.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, September 5, 1863-10 p.m.

General GILLMORE:

There are two monitors up now near Sumter, with orders to fire to the right and left of it, by way of a diversion. If you wish it, I will send more up. I will send them orders to retire at 1 o'clock.

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, Morris island, S. C., September 5, 1863.

Rear-Admiral JOHN A. DAHLGREN,Commanding South Atlantic Blockading Squadron:

DEAR SIR: There is no change in the programme for to-night, excepting so far as the monitors firing on Gregg is concerned. The idea is, that while we are assaulting Gregg, no re-enforcements shall be approaching in our rear and no firing shall take place in that direction, and that the monitors shall remain in [in pairs] and cut off communication with Cumming's Point, directing their fire on Moultrie or Sumter.
