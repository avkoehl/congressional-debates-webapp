to attack and take a fortified port of the Gulf, is to be ready for embarkation on the 15th instant. The troops of Benton's and Andrews' division of your command will sail first, taking, however, but two light batteries with them. The remaining material and General Veatch's division will follow as soon as the necessary transportation can be furnished and the troops on duty in and near Mobile can be relieved by others. The land transportation to be taken with the troops is limited to one wagon for every 200 men, and two ambulances for every 500 men, and one horse for each mounted officer. All other transportation is to be left behind and will come up with the remainder of your corps. The infantry is to be supplied with 100 rounds of ammunition per man, and the artillery with the full amount they can carry in their caissons and limber boxes. A reserve supply for 150 rounds for small-arms and artillery is required besides. General Totten, chief of ordnance, is apprised of these wants and has prepared for them. A sufficient number of intrenching tools must be distributed within the commands to enable about 5,000 men to throw up a line of defensive works immediately after they have been landed. The chief engineer, Major McAlester, has orders to provide for these tools and a large number of sand-bags, &amp;c., and will be ready to meet you requisitions; so will also the quartermaster's department in regard to water and land transportation, and all stores and materials which may be wanted during the sea voyage, the landing, and attack. Colonel Hinsdill, chief commissary of subsistence, will be prepared in good season to supply the troops with field rations up to the last of this month.

I am, general, with great respect, your obedient servant,

P. JOS. OSTERHAUS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
