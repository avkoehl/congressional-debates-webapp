So (two thirds voting in favor thereof) the
motion to suspend the rules was agreed to;
and the resolution was referred to the Com-
mittee on Printing.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. Is not the resolution
debatable ?
The SPEAKER. It is not; it goes to the
Committee on Printing.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I understand a resolu-
tion to print to be debatable. The motion to
suspend the rules, which is not debatable, can-
not prevent the House from debating a resolu-
tion of this kind.
The SPEAKER. The Chair overrules the
point on two grounds, both of which the gen-
tleman will recognize. The first is that the
gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Schenck] moved
to suspend the rules for the purpose of refer-
ring the resolution ; the second is, even if he
had not made that motion, the resolution to
print must be referred to the Committee on
Printing without debate. It must come back
from the committee before it can be consid-
ered by the House. Therefore, while the mo-
tion to suspend the rules is to allow the resolu-
tion to be introduced, the effect of a suspension
of the rules is to refer the resolution to the
Committee on Printing. When the resolution
comes back from the committee it may be
debated.
Mr. SCHENCK. Can the vote to refer to
the Committee on Printing be reconsidered?
The SPEAKER. It goes to the committee
under the laiv, and therefore cannot be recon-
sidered ; even by unanimous consent the law
cannot be waived. It has so been decided by
the predecessors in theSpeaker's chair as well
as by himself.

Mr. SHANKS, by unanimous consent, intro-

impeachment of the president.
Mr. STEWART. I submit that legislative
business is a violation of the rule, and out of
order.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. I believe
that the trial of the impeachment was adjourned
until twelve o'clock, which was the hour to
^liich the Senate adjourned, which somewhat
embarrasses the proceedings. It is the opinion
of the Chair that all legislative business is sus-
pended by the adjournment of the court, and
that nothing now is in order. The Chair will
be vacated under the order of the Senate, that
the Chief Justice may preside over the trial
of the impeachment.
The President pro tempore thereupon vacated
the chair, and the Senate proceeded to the trial
ofthe impeachment ofPresident Johnson. The
Senate sitting for the" trial of the impeachment
having adjourned,
