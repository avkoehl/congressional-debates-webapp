recommendation was seconded by a very able leport frem

he shoved the índispeo&abl necessity of such an institution
The recommen Jations were promptly re pondtd to by Con

the currency was refei ted to on the following day (6th Decern

On the 8th of Jmuary, IS 6 Mi Cdihoun reported the bill to
establish a Bank of the United ¡stateb (See .Journal, 18lb p

taken on the passage of the bill in the House of Representa
uves when it passed by avoteof 80 to 71 (See Journal 1816,
pp 489 and 490) In the Senate this bill passed by a vote ot
22aves to 12noes, aril it leueived tha sanction oi Piesident

Here Mr Chairman, let us pause to analyze these votes that
we may <-ee how iai the charge that this Bank was a redera!
measure carried by Federal vacs is sustained by the lecoid
The ayes and noes are now before me and I have prepared a
careful analysis of them, which exi tbus the ful owing lesult
In the be íate, of the twenty two who voted for the Bank sc
venteen wete Republicans and five Federalists, aid of the
twelve who voted against it, seven were Federalists and five
were R publicans In the House of Representatives, of the
eighty members who voted lor the bill, sixty seven were He
pubheansand thirteen were Federalists, whilst of the Bev nty
one who voted against the Bank thirty were Republicana and
foity one weieFeleiahsts And yet gentlemen teWus this was
a Federal measuie' A Federal measure, though two thirds of
the Federa sts voted against it, and two thuds oí the ftepubh
cans in both Houses voteu for it'
But the gentleman from Noith Carolina [Mt Saunders] telis
the House that the constitutional question was not raited in
1816 The Federalists were estopped fiom raising i and as
the Republicans intended to vote lor it, of course they would
not raise i ' I must confess this is a novel doctrine to me Tne
constitutional question nutiaised1* How was it possible toavoid
lú Does not tne constitutional power—or m other word*, the
jurisdiction of ( ongress over the euhj ct matter under cons de
ration—arise m every conceivable case? Does it not lie at the
threshold of every questnn? If you have no cmststu nal
piwer overasubject y< u cannot act upon it at al and if you
do act upon it, the coatlusion ti it, in >ouropi ion, >ou rave
the power to art, is a necessaryconsequence of your ¡cum
Away, then, with the notion t at the constitutional power was
not drawn in question m 1816' It was questioned, it wab de
bat3d, and it was deci <Jd
But, sir   t may not be uninteresting or unpiofitable to let the
coui try know who some of  these Federalists weie who con
spired  ,o fasten this horrible monster oí a Bank of the Un ed

But we are notlett in the dark as to the sentiments of the ab

The«e facts are surely enough to s' stain the p opo<*i ion that

1816 If gentlemen wnh any furthei evidence let me pom*
them to the fact tha* a vacancy having occurred in the Senate
of the United States by the le^rianon ol Mr John W Fpne* ,
in December 1819 Mr James Pleasants who had as a mem
bei of the House of Representatives otel for the Bank of
1816, wt  elened to fill that honoiablp" ation And to crown
all in 1824 Virginia bv a larg° majority ca&t her Presidential
vote in favor of Willun IT Cnwford the man who through
good and thiouah evil report, ul oeen th staunch, undeviat
me friend of the Bank, at d whose repu ation- as a statesman
íested moie upon his able ard uniform support of that ins itu

With this hi'Jtoi teal review of the bank question, I leave it to
this Home and to the count) y to ^ay how far J am sus ai ed in

From this table it will appear that the Northern and Eastern
States were strorgly opuosed to the Bank, that the Middl*
States were comparatively índifleje-u as to us fate, whilst th«
South and Wtst earned ihe bill, giving neaily two-thirds of
their votes m us favor Tris is a v°ry sti ikmg ¡act, and it htó
tnv^n ns  to so ne tflect ons m my m nd as to the probable
reason of i , andl mvne the attcition of ny fuerds fiom South
Carolina especially to one view which has presented Uself to
riymul We of the South hive always opposed a tauff for
} ro ection, on thegiound that the du'y enhanced the price of
meichandse and that the consumers in the South ultimately
boio thebuiden, or, in other woiJs that the duty was a bounty
to the Noithem m mufactuier, a inch was paid by the Southern
consumei Without pietendmg to discuss the precise extent
to which this argument i& sound, I am willing, for the present,
to admit its truth to the full extent But let us see if there is
not another mode of taxing the South and West for the benefit
oftheNoi h which is equally objectionable m principle, and
equally oner us in practice I allude to the derangement in
ihe exchanges of the conntrv Weall know that the Northern
are the importing and manufacturing States, whiie the South-
ern aro the consurung &tate& In 1816, Mr McDuffie tells
us in his icpoit, ihe average rate of exchange between the
Nonhern and Southern divisions of the Union was about ten
p r cent in faver of the North, and it is not a great deal less
now
Now, how lid this derancementopeiate practically? and how
does u opeiate ntw] Ihe whole amount of our impoits are
now esuir ted at one hundred and forty milhonsof dollars Let
us suppose tha ffty mi'icnsnf h   amount aie consun ed in
t e ¡Southern and Western States What is the process which
mu<{ be pa^ed thiough before these goods are consumed^ In
tht first p aco, thej die imported into the Northern citie&, and
the southern merchants go there to lay m their supplies They
eithei take with them their iocat paper, which is atadiscount
often percent or they pay a piemium of ten percent athome
foi adiaf en o e of the Northern cities If they Take the local
pa| ei with them to market, they are not able to buy goods with
it a* cash puces, and they are, therefue compelled either to
go to the brokei s shop and have the money bhaved at ten per
cert or they let the met chant indirectly tUiii b^okei, and exact
the premi it i m the enhanced price of the goods VVl at do the
Southern mercrantsdo next^ Do they lose this ten per ceit
out of thu piofiisi By no means The amount paid as a
piemium ( t die uraft, or the amount paid to trie b'-oke -,
is esbentti* v iust as mm h a part of the price paid (or
tht, "iods ts the amour t paid to tne importer The mer
chai ha i<L.?ards n and in fixing his price on his goods,
he always adds t > the amount paid to the importer the amount
of the biokerage 11 piemium and then lays his profit on the
aegiegate and the coi mm rs the firméis anu planners of the
counuy, pay the whole And who erjo)& the berefití Is it
not the broken and money chuiigus ol the Noith? I beg gen
ttemen to look at th s proposition seriously If theSomn co i
sumes filty millions of imports and if the brokerage, or pre
miun , on exchange i'ten per cert I ask, does it not operate to
tax the South to the an our t of tl at ten per cent or five mil
lions o dollars, for the benefit of theNouh? Or, to bring the
case home to ouiselves do not the constituents of every gentle
man on this fiooi, wh consume #100000 worth ofmerchati
dise brci ghifrum the \orth pav a tax to the Northern broker 
to theextei t of f e o ten thoiiband uoilars, as the rate of ex
change mav ha¡ en to be five or ten per cent 1 I am aware
that Llnssiatf of hmCT3 could not continue peimanemly, but
it is always the cat>e upon any sudden and violent revulsion in
the business of t!ij country which disturls the cuirency and
deianget- the exchanges May not this view of the subject fur-
nish some clew to the reason which governed the votes of the
different ssctions of the Union in 1816? Our Northern bre
threuare shiewd and sagacious m seeing their interests, and
if they found that the derangement of the currency was * mur
mg to their benefit " is it a mattei of surpnse that they should
be opposed n a Bank, \nich wouldre<toiea uniform cur) ei cy
and equa ¿e the exenanges, ai d deprive the swarm of brokers
and miney changers who always reap m the field of a de
ranged cutienry, oí l e rich hai vest which they were gather
mg The Middle co itiy occupied a position of comparative
ncntiality, and hente you find that therepresentation from that
country was almost equaüy divided, whilst the South and
West, whowert, the principal sufTeierf, were the waimeetad-
v ica es of a bark and i s (onscqiic ces—a sound currency and
fquat exchanges If this v ew oí the subject be correct m re
gaid to the year 1&% sit no equally c<rrect in regard to the
f. resant time7 Andl call upon members fiom the South and
West to a whet er the inte eets of their constituents do not
impenoush íequirethat ihev should now go for a B'rk'i
Having thus piesen ed an outline of iht political history of
the Bank, I propobe to subiruta few observatione m regard to
i as connected w th the currency and busmes> of the country
