particular field of a State in which each agent is to operate should be specified in the letter of appointment. To avoid confusion, the number of agents should not be large. Experience has shown that these agents should not be paid each recruit, but that they should have a fixed compensation for their services; otherwise fraudulent practices may be resorted to for the pecuniary benefit of the agent, to the great prejudice of the State and the military service.

2. It shall be the duty of the recruiting agents, before entering upon their duties, to report in person, through the commanding officer of the rendezvous herein designated for the States in which they are to operate, to the commanding officer of the military district, department, or army, in order that they may have a proper pass and protection. All recruiting agents will be subject to the Rules and Articles of War.

3. It shall be the duty of the commanding officer of the army, department, or district in which recruiting agents operate, and of commanding officers of rendezvous, to order back to his State (or arrest and hold for trial, as he may deem best) any recruiting agent who shall commit frauds upon the Government or recruits, or shall violate the instructions issued to govern this recruitment, or be guilty of any offense against military law. Recruiting agents will be held responsible for the conduct of all persons who act under their authority or direction.

4. No man shall be recruited who is already in the military service as soldier, teamster, laborer, guide, &amp;c., or who is so employed by the military authorities as to be of importance to military operations.

5. Recruits procured in accordance with the act quoted must be delivered by the recruiting agents at one of the following-named rendezvous, viz:

Camp Casey, Washington, D. C., for Northeast Virginia.

Camp

-----

, near Fort Monroe, Va., for Southeast Virginia.

Camp

-----

, New Berne, N. C., for North Carolina.

Camp

-----

, Hilton Head, S. C., for South Carolina and Florida.

Camp

-----

, Vicksburg, Miss., for Mississippi.

Camp

-----

, Nashville, Tenn., for Georgia and Alabama.

When received at the rendezvous it shall be the duty of the U. S. officers there to have the recruits promptly examined, and, if accepted, to have them immediately mustered into the U. S. service, properly provided for, and sent to the regiments for which they may have been enlisted or assigned. A certified copy of the muster-in roll shall be given to the recruiting agent whenever at least ten recruits shall be mustered.

The aforesaid rendezvous are regarded as military posts, and will be conducted as such under the immediate orders of the War Department as issued through the Adjutant-General's Office; but department and army commanders are desired to exercise a supervision over them, as coming within the limits of their departments, and to make any reports to this office concerning them which may be deemed advisable.

6. If it is desired to put any of the volunteer recruits obtained under this act into service as substitutes before or after draft, they must be sent, without expense to the Government, by the recruiting agent to the district in which the principal is enroled and there be mustered in by the provost-marshal, who will issue the proper substitution papers.

7. It is made the duty of commanding officers to afford to recruiting agents all such facilities as they can provide without detriment
