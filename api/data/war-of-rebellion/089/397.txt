SIGNAL STATION, October 27, 1864-5 p.m.

General TERRY:

Colonel Wright, most excellent officer, riding along my whole line, as inclined to think the enemy reduced, but can really give no reasons or clear facts.

HAWLEY,

General.

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully forwarded.

General Hawley has orders to push in if the force is so far reduced as to give him a good chance of success.

ALF. H. TERRY,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, October 27, 1864-8 a.m.

Lieutenant Colonel E. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of Va. and N. C.:

At this hour the head of my column has struck the Darbytown road at its intersection with the Drill-Room road. There is skirmishing going on in my front, which I suppose to be Spear's clearing out rebel scouts and pickets according to my instructions.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, October 27, 1864-9.50 a.m.

Lieutenant Colonel E. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of Va. and N. C.:

At this hour the head of my column has reached White's Tavern. Colonel West reports the enemy's line to extend across the Charles City road; the works on this road are reported formidable and heavily manned. It is further reported to me that General Terry's line does not come up to this road; I have sent a staff officer to ascertain his right. I suppose that, notwithstanding the fact that General Terry does not come to this road as ordered, you desire me to take the road past Mrs. Carter's to the Williamsburg road, and I shall move on that supposition, trying to keep communication with Terry's line through the cavalry. Please send me orders what you wish me now to do. I intend to move down the Charles City road to the road which goes to the Williamsburg road about three-quarters of a mile below here.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.
