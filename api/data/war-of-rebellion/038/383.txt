The road from here to Tuscumbia River will be protected by troops at Chewalla at present. The guard at Tuscumbia and Hatchie are sufficient.

You will make your headquarters at Pocahontas.

By order of Brigadier General G. M. Dodge:

GEO. E. SPENCER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CINCINNATI, OHIO, June 3, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

Your dispatch received.

Rosecrans is relying upon my advance into Tennessee, and I am all ready. If I do not go there, some 8,000 or 10,000 men might be spared for Grant. Rosecrans has just telegraphed me that he is moving, and wants me to push on. I leave for Hickman Bridge at daylight to-morrow. Telegraph me at Lexington.

A. E. BURNSIDE.

WASHINGTON, D. C., June 3, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

You will immediately dispatch 8,000 men to General Grant at Vicksburg. Should it be found that General Grant will not require them, they will be stopped by the way or returned to you as early as possible. Concentrate your remaining forces as much as you can. I think there is no fear of an advance upon Kentucky at present.

H. W. HALLECK,

SAINT LOUIS, MO. June 3, 1863. -3 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK:

I have concluded to send eight regiments and three batteries. The last will be off to-morrow. This leaves me very weak, but I will do it in view of the vast importance of Grant's success.

SCHOFIELD.

SAINT LOUIS, MO. June 3, 1863-11. 30 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK:

Kirby Smith went to Louisiana some time ago with a considerable force. Is not this what General Banks refers to?*

My latest information is that Price has still 10,000 or 12,000 infantry near Little Rock. If satisfied that this force has gone also, I can send more troops down the river. Shall I run the risk of sending them now?

J. M. SCHOFIELD.

WASHINGTON, D. C., June 3, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

You must hurry forward re-enforcements to General Grant. If you cannot hire river boats, you must impress them. Telegrams from Memphis say that Bragg is sending large re-enforcements to Johnston.

H. W. HALLECK.
