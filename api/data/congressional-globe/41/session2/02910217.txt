The Tariff—Mr. Asper.
Ho. op Reps.
pany, in order to swell the great dividends of
that company. Why, sir, it is unjust; it is not
that sortof taxation that the people are willing
to endure, and they have a right to cry out
against this interest, and to cry out against
such an adjustment of taxation. If there were
but a nominal duty npon salt of 5, 10, or 15
per cent, ad valorem, there would be sufficient
importation, which would give to the Treasury
a fair revenue, and, with the manufacture in
this country, would create such a competition
as to bring salt back to a reasonable price per
bushel and bring it home to the people, and
would to that extent cheapen their food.
Passing along, for I cannot occupy any great
length of time upon one particular point, I wish
now to call the attention of the committee to
the proposed adjustment of the duties on lum-
ber. I believe that this bill increases the duty
upon the cheaper article of lumber, that lumber
which goes into consumption in the erection
of fences and rough buildings all over the coun-
try. I:i it necessary that this shall be done ?
If it is necessary, then our people are ready
and willing to bear the burden and pay the ad-
ditional price for their lumber. But will these
duties levied by the tariff bill be paid into the
Treasury, or will they go in the pockets of those
who are engaged in lumbering in Michigan, in
Wisconsin, Minnesota, and elsewhere? Already
the business of lumbering has been commenced
upon the Black hills, has been commenced upon
the llocky mountains, and is extending all over
the country. If it is necessary for the interests
of the Government that we shall pay this addi-
tional price, then we are ready to do it. But I
hold that it is wholly unnecessary. 1 presume
it may be taken for granted that the price of
lumber is increased m consequence of the du-
ties imposed by the present tariff law. 1 have
some facts in relation to that point which 1
will read.

has taken place in the price pt-r 1,0(10 feet of

It will bn observed that of the lumber most in
cleiiiimd for building purposes the advance in prices
ii-oni 1851 to 1867 was follows:
Spruce, 150 per cent.; pine, 119, and hemlock, the
io-t in demand for erection of tiu> eommrm dps™-,'n-
tlie increase from the prices of 1860, on the above
varieties, 100.9i and 100 per cent, respectively.
It must be remembeted that the operation
of the reciprocity treaty ceased in 1866, and
immediately the price of lumber ran up from
$22 12 to $29 84. The next year it was at
$27 42, and in 1868 it was at $25 95. I have
not the prices for la§t year. But I have read
enough to show that the price of lumber has
increased. Why and how is it that this increase
of price exists ? Is it not because of the impo-
sition by the tariff law of this duty of $2 per
1,000 feet on a certain class of lumber and
$1 per 1,000 feet on another class? And the
bill now pending adjusts the duties on a still
higher scale for the lower grade of lumber.
The gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Strick-
land] who spoke here on Saturday says that
the State of Michigan alone had added to the
production of lumber during the last year
2,000,000,000 feet. If that be true, and I
have no reason to doubt it, then (he amount
which has been paid into the pockets of the
lumbering men in Michigan last year was in
the neighborhood of $2,000,000.
Mr. STRICKLAND. Let me ask the gen-
tleman if he takes into account the fact that we
supported 080,000 persons, the men engaged in
lumbering, thus furnishing a market for ,the
farmers of the West by giving them a better
market, than they had tit any other place in the
United States?
Mr. ASPER. I suppose if the lumbering
companies in the State ot Michigan employ meu
tliey pay them, and with their wages they buy
food for themselves and families at the usual
market prices ; but I do not propose that the
people of Missouri and of the far West shall
pay into the pockets of the lumbering men large
dividends over and above the price of the labor-
ers whom they pay and tho ordinary expenses
of their business. I do not think that it is
necessary.
Why, sir, if the tariff were stricken off lum-
ber entirely, if there was not a cent of duty
imposed upon lumber, what would be the result?
Would there be any decrease in the price of
lumber? Most certainly, as the imported lum-
ber from Canada would then enter into com-
petition with our own manufactures and tho
price decline to the extent at least of the duty.
The demand for lumber is constantly increas-
ing. We are extending our farms in the west-
ern country and upon the plains; and every
habitation erected there, every quarter-section
of land brought under cultivation there, every
forty-acre tract even increases the demand for
lumber. Houses must be constructed, however
small, in which to reside; fences must be built
to protect the crops, and those houses and
fences built by the men who extend those plant-
ations westward and westward will consume
lumber and cause the demand for it to increase.
The article of lumber is one of prime neces-
sity, one which enters into general use in this
country. The people require it and must have
it, no matter what may be the duty placed upon
it. You have not placed upon lumber a duty
so high as to amount to prohibition, for there
has been brought into this country some
8,000,000 or 10 000,000 feet of lumber, the
whole consumption amounting to the neigh-
borhood of 00,000,000 feet. While there has
been paid into the Treasury during the last
fiscal year about the sum of SI,100,000 as du-
ties upon the lumber imported, there has been
paid to the men engaged in the lumber business
some $15,000,000 or $16,000,000 more than
was a fair remuneration to them for the inter-
est on their capital and the labor which they
bestowed upon their business; and this is a
tax on the farmer, the laborer, and the general
consumer of this prime article of necessity for
the benefit of a special interest that ought not
to be imposed.
There is where the adjustment of the duty
on these articles injures us ; it comes home to
the farmer and the laborer, to the man who
builds a little hut and makes his small in-
closure upon the prairie away out in the West.
We do not require this tariff. The lumbering
men would go on with their business without
this tariff. Pine trees would be cut and saVced
into lumber, and shipped wherever there was
a demand for it. And the demand for lumber
is constantly increasing year by year, as the
following facts, takenfrom Mr. Wells's report
for 1868, will show:
" Thus tho incrcaso at Albany of tho quantity of
boards and scantling received by the canals alono
in tha two years from 1865 to 1867 was nearly 50 por
cent., or 25 por eent. por annum; while at Chicago,
in tho four years from 1863 to 1867, tho increaso in
tho reooipts was as follows: on lumber, 113 per cent.;
ehinglos, 159 por cent.; and in laths, 251 per cont."
Mr. BLAIR. Will the gentleman yield for
a question?
Mr. ASPER. Yes, certainly.
Mr. BLAIR. The question I wish to put to
the gentleman is, whether in the State of Mis-
souri Canada lumber competes with tho lum-
ber of Wisconsin and Minnesota? Is not the
costof transportation from Canada to Missouri
greater than the whole of those tariff duties ou
lumber ? And therefore can these tariff duties
affect the price of lumber in Missouri ? I think
not.
Mr. ASPER. The cost of transportation is
not greater than the duties.
Mr. BLAIR. I think the gentleman is mis-
taken.
Mr. ASPER. The great bulk of the lum-
ber consumed in my State and sold even in my
town comes from the city of Chicago, the most
of it manufactured in the State of Michigan ;
and the price is regulated by the law of supply
and demand, with the duty added, as our home
mills do not give a full supply.
Mr. BLAIR. Yes, sir ; butcan lumber come
from Canada to Missouri ?
Mr. ASPER. It can.
Mr. BLAIR. If the gentleman will allow
me, I will say that it costs more to bring the
lumber from the Canada lines to Chicago than
tho whole of those duties amount to.
Mr. ASPER. If that is true, why do you
put this tariff on lumber? Why subject us to
this heavy burden in orderto protect that par-
ticular branch of manufacture?
Mr. BLAIR. If tho gentleman wants an
answer 1 will say that upon the line of coun-
try between ua and Canada, where the distance
is short, there is a difference, as a matter of
course. Wo wish these Canadians when they
come into the markets of the United tStates,
as they pay nothing toward sustaining the
burdens of this Government, to pay for tho
privilege of coining into that market. That m
what we ask. We want the revenue, and wo
may as well get it from Canadians as from any
one else.
Mr. ASPER. It is a benefit to the manu-
facturers oflumber in Michigan, for it enables
them to get from $1 to $2 per 1,000 more in
Missouri and Kansas, where lumber is needed.
Why impose this duty if it is not for the pur-
pose of increasing the price of lumber?
Mr. BLAIR. Por the purpose of revenue.
Mr. ASPER. For the purpose of revenue'
But do you get the revenue ? You put in tho
Treasury perhaps §1,000,000 last year from
the duties on lumber, while the dealers in lum-
ber pocketed a profit of from $15,000,000 to
$16,000,000. That is the adjustment of the
duties of which we complain. That is the rea-
son we are here raising our voices in opposi-
tion to this bill. We say to you that m its
details you should so adjust the duties upon
lumber, salt, iron, and other articles that enter
into general consumption, and which are ic-
garded as articles of prime necessity, as not to
oppress labor and the farming interests of the
country, and not to bring down the farmers of
this country to the level of the pauper labor
of Europe.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. I ask the
gentleman whether this tariff bill does not re-
duce the duty upon lumber?
