NOTE ON ORIGINAL RETURN.- The above return is as nearly correct as can be rendered on account of the confusion and incorrectness of the several returns of subordinate commanders, particularly those of Major-General Milroy and Brigadier-General Kelley.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 1, 1863. (Received 1. p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

The following dispatch has just been received from General Geary at Stafford Court-House, who says the party communicating the information is entirely reliable.* The portion of it relating to Fitzhugh Lee is verified by his late appearance here.

FEBRUARY 26, 1863.

Brigadier General JOHN W. GEARY:

DEAR SIR: I wish to inform you that the rebels have sent 1,000 cavalry to Frank Adams', near Aldie, Loudoun County, Va. Major White's battalion and Major Strayhern's [?] battalion and a Virginia regiment of cavalry of General Stuart have also arrived at the same place. All of the above rebel troops were there on February 22, and issued orders that no citizen should bring any provisions within our lines, and that they came to enforce an order that no provisions or supplies of any kind shall be sent out of their lines. Fitzhugh Lee has moved with 5,000 troops-cavalry, infantry, and artillery-to Culpeper Court-House, and I have also reliable information that General Jackson is now encamped 10 miles below Fredericksburg.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.

DUMFRIES, March 1, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel H. C. RODGERS, Assistant Adjutant-General:

Our scout brought in information to-day that there was a force of cavalry and artillery at Warrenton. They came there day before yester-
