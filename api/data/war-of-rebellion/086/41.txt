miles; fords begin above mouth of Black. Lambert stopped at Tipton last night. He did not hear of any rebel force this side of La Mine. Two Union men from Fayette report one company of rebels only in Howard. Steam-boat, with 300 men, gone to Boonville, to-day to get information.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 17, 1864-12 m.

Major General A. J. SMITH,

La Mine Bridge:

The brigade at California had left there for Tipton before your dispatch was received. Pleasonton will be at Tipton to-night. He has ordered this brigade to halt at Tipton, and directed it to scout toward Boonville. Colonel Winslow's other brigade has orders to push on and will at least reach California to-night. After considering the difficulties of the La Mine hills and river the general considers it most probable that Price will move toward Lexington, and, while a proper precaution should be used to prevent his taking the back track, yet our principal combinations should be made with reference to the more probable movement toward Lexington. This consideration should govern Sanborn's movements also.

JOHN V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

LA MINE BRIDGE, October 17, 1864-7.45 p.m.

Colonel J. V. DU BOIS,

Chief of Staff:

Has Pleasonton left Jefferson City? If so, where will I find him? Colonel Moore, at Sedalia, reports Jeff. Thompson about twelve miles west of Sedalia, driving cattle north and west. I have merely an escort for the purpose of collecting cattle for the command, and no other cavalry under my control.
