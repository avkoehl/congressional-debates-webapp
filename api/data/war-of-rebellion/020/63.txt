Moreover, the Seventh Connecticut had been on very severe fatigue duty the three previous nights. I desire in this official report to place on record my objections to these early morning attacks. they are justifiable, in my humble judgment, only under extraordinary circumstances. The troops get necessarily but little rest the night before, and they go to the work fatigued and excited. An attack at a more advanced period of the day I consider vastly preferable. These views I presented with all possible cogency and earnestness to General Benham on the evening of the 15th in stating my objections to his proposed attack at daylight on the morning of the 16th.

I must confess that the coolness and mobility of all the troops engaged on the 16th instant surprised me, and I cannot but believe, had proper use been made of the artillery guns from the Navy, and our own batteries, fixed and field; had the position been gradually approached and carefully examined and the attack made much later in the day, when our batteries had had their full effect - all which you will recollect were strongly urged by me upon General Benham the evening of the conference - the result might have been very different.

From the best information I can get I am satisfied the force of the enemy on the peninsula at Secessionville and in immediate defense of his works was five regiments, or about 3,000 effective men. It was the headquarters of his advance forces on James Island, and was in command of a general officer.
