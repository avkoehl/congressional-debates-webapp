MURFREESBOROUGH, TENN.,

March 16, 1863-11 p. m.

I have the pleasure to report the gallant conduct of our cavalry, under the brave Colonel Minty. They drove the rebel cavalry wherever they met them, captured one of their camps, 17 wagons, 42 mules, and 64 prisoners. They used the saber where the carbine would delay.

TRIUNE, March 6, 1863.

GENERAL: My command is at this point, occupying the junction of the Nolensville pike and Franklin roads, with my outpost 1 1/2 miles toward Franklin. General Sheridan's command is in front of me, at junction of the Nolensville and Shelbyville pikes. No enemy in force in that direction. I made a successful reconnaissance to the rebel camp, 2 miles beyond Chapel Hill, routing and driving Roddey's cavalry (two regiments) all across Duck River. We wounded 7 of the enemy, captured 60, with their horses and equipments, and returned to this point at 6 o'clock this morning, without loss or injury.

Bad news from Franklin; our loss heavy.

Brigadier-General.
