THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January II
I
[Mr. Stephens] inquired of the Chair what
would be the regular order of business in the
morning hour. The first business is the dispo-
sition of'this report from the Committee on For-
eign Affairs. The next business will be the dis-
position of the report made from the Committee
of Ways and Means of the n'Sfval appropriation
bill, and then the call of committees commencing
with the Committee of Elections. The Chair has
already called each committee once during this
session.
Mr. STEPHENS, of Georgia. My opinion
was that that call was made under a special order
of the House. *
The SPEAKER. The Chair had proceeded to
call the committees the day after they were ap-
pointed, and befoie the special order was made.
Mr. STEPHENS, of Georgia. I then insist
upon tho regular order of business, in order that
we may reach the Committee on Territories, as
soon as possible*
The SPEAKER. The Committee on Foreign
Affairs reported the following resolutions;

So the motion to refer was disagreed to.
Mr. MILLSON. Mr. Speaker, I do not think
that the occasion requires from us the expression
of any opinion upon the subject. I therefore
move that the whole subject be laid upon the
table; and on that motion ! call for the yeas and
nay*-
Mr. REAGAN. I hope the vote ordering the
previous question will be reconsidered, in order
that we may be permitted to have some debate on
this question. 1 want, myself, an opportunity to
express my dissent to the whole doctrine of filli-
busterism.
Mr. JONES* of Tennessee. I appeal to the
gentleman from "Virginia to withdraw the motion
to lay upon the table. Let us have separate votea
on the various propositions.
Several Members. That is right, and is all we
ask.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. Commodore Pauld-
ing did nothing wronj*, unless it was in arresting
William Walker and such of his followers as
were citizens of Nicaragua, and sending them to
the United States. 1 think he did right, and acted
in obedience to his instructions, in rescuing; citi-
zens of the United States engaged m that unlaw-
ful expedition, and sending them back to their
own country, the United States.
Mr. HARiCSDALli. 1 am of the opinion that
Commodore Paulding did nothing that was right.
Mr. MILLSON. i may agree with the gentle-
man from Tennessee m what he has said; but as
1 said before, 1 do not think the occasion would
justify the expression of any opinion upon the
part of the House. '
Mr. KELSEY. Can a motion to lay upon the
table be repeated when it has just been rejected ?
The SPEAXCER. There has been intervening
business, changing the condition of the question.
Mr. REAGAN. Let us have the question
opened to debate.
Mr. HUGHES. How many propositions are
there before the House.
The SPEAKER. Only four.
Mr. HUGHES. Is it too late to object to any
more than three propositions being before the
IXuitse at orjce ?
The SPEAKER. It is: the proposition of
the gentleman from Georgia was unanimously
received at the last session.
Mr. BOWIE. I ask that the resolutions be
agam read.
The resolutions were again read.
Mr. HOUSTON. Is it comnetent for me to
ask for a division of the last amendment r 1 u«-
derstand that we vote first on the amendment last
lead. Is it divisible ?
The SPEAKEX^. The previous question has
I been called and seconded, and the main question
