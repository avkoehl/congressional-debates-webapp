Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 7, 1864.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Commanding Ninth Corps:

GENERAL: I am instructed by the major-general commanding to say, that upon an examination of the enemy's intrenched position by the chief engineer and the chief of artillery, it has been concluded that the operations upon your front cannot be carried to a successful conclusion until the salients on the front of the Fifth Corps are in our possession or under our control. Accordingly it has been determined to conduct regular approaches upon the two fronts of your corps and that of General Warren simultaneously, and in order to give unity and harmony to these operations the siege works will be constructed under the direction of the chief engineer of the army, and the disposition and use of the siege artillery will be under the direction of the chief of artillery of the army. An order to that effect, prescribing in general terms the manner in which the siege operations will be conducted, will be issued, and in the meantime the commanding general prefers that no additional batteries of siege guns should be established.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
