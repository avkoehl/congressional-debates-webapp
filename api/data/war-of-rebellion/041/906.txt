we had not received any for six months, although several estimates had been forwarded in that time.

We have also shipped to the Department of the Gulf 1,200 serviceable mules, of which 300 were sent from Natchez, and the remaining 900 from this place. Yet, in spite of all this, they have made representations to the authorities at Washington which are highly detrimental to us. I would respectfully state that numerous estimates for various supplies needed at this post have been forwarded to the proper officers, as also many duplicates to the same, to which, I am sorry to say, the necessary attention has not been given.

Respectfully submitting the foregoing your consideration, I am, general, your most obedient servant,

W. C. HURLBUT,

Captain, and Assistant Quartermaster.

ASSISTANT QUARTERMASTER'S OFFICE,

Vicksburg, Miss., January 4, 1864.

Captain SAMUEL TAGGART, Assistant Adjutant-General:

The steamer Collier has just arrived with a tow of nine barges of coal, estimated to contain 125,000 bushels of coal. I am informed by the captain of the boat that it is private coal, and is to be sold to the Government at a contract price on its arrival in New Orleans. The steamer Porter is still in port with about 25,000 bushels of coal belonging to the quartermaster's department, and this is also consigned to New Orleans. About 8,000 bushels of the original amount that the Porter had has been ordered to be detained.

We are in great need of coal, and thought best to notify you of the fact, so that you could take such measures as you think best.
