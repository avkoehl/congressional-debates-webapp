Some of the miles of this sub-district are behaving badly. They pass themselves as bushwhackers, and rob, burn, and kill. I have no cavalry to arrest them, except two of the Ninth Missouri State Militia, four ofthe Third Missouri State Militia, and four of Second Missouri Cavalry, ten in all, who have just returned from duty required by the provost-marshal before the order to send them to their respective commands was received by me. Can I retain them here for the present?
