COLONEL: Division left Shellmound at 2 p.m. yesterday. Third Brigade (Turchin's) came through to this place last night. Second Brigade (King's) and trains now coming in. Roads horrible. The crossing of Raccoon Mountain fully as bad as anything we have had. Am just in receipt of instructions from headquarters of department ordering general movement. The forks of the road, 2 miles from Trenton, is now held by one regiment and a section of artillery of my division. Have not heard from General Baird, but will attend to Frick's Gap at earliest moment practicable. Am in communication with Twenty-first Army Corps, Wood's division of which we left at Shellmound. I greatly need one of my regiments of mounted men. Is Colonel Carlton's regiment at Tracy City ordered to rejoin division?
