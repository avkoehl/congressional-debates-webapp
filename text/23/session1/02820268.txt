THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 21,
great chait to which the people looked, and which,
os it doubtless would be adhered to by the Ptesi-
dent in Ins conduct to the oank, it would alone be
their safest guide, and ult.mately would prodjce
safety and continuance to their free institutions
Mr. S, proceeded to show why, according to his
views, the ban!: was not constitutional The States
had íeserved to themselves all powers which were
not granted to the Federal Government The
question arobe, whether this powei was so granted5
'1 he grant was not to be found m the Constitution
So tai from that, it was a matter of history that it
, was proposed in the convention to give this power,
and that the proposition wa? íejected Mi S
referred to the histoiy of the convention, to prove
this fact The specific power to mcoiporate a
bank was not proposed, but a power to incorpo-
rate companies generally was proposed and re-
jected f o this argument it had been replied that
the proposition was rejected because it would have
endangeied the adoption of the whole instrument
by the people His view of the subject was, that
the power did not exist, unless it was specifically
granted
Mi S referred to the argument that the faith of
the Government being pledged, it was proper to
íeturn the deposites, even admitting the institution
to be unconstitutional The Secret iry, lie argued,
'had an uncontiolled discretion in regard to thedig-
position of the deposites, end that this power was
granted in the cheitei What light had the bank
to complain of the exercise of the powei, when it
was secured to the Secretary of the Treasury by
the very terms of the contract with the bank' It
had been said that the Piesident had assumed an
illegal power over the public money But the fact
was that Congress had the same power over the
pjbhc treasure now which they had before the
depositen were removed, and the power cf the
President was not greater now than it was before.
The question now is, what shall be done with the
public money > He contended that legislative
power was inalienable No one disputed this, and
lite sixteenth seciton of the chatter, reserving to the
Secietary of the Treasury the power of removal,
showed conclusively that Congress did not intend
to legislate away their legislative power The
question what shall be done with the deposites?
now came up as an original question We could
do with them whatevei we pleased
Mi S ptoceeded to inquiieinto the expediency
of a national buik as a fiscal agent, and into the
causes of the existing public distress In many
points of view, he represented this concentration
of money-power as dangerous to the liberties of
the country He lefened to the iecent effoits of
the bank to misiepiesent the acts of the President,
through memorials elicited from the people, as a
proof of the capacity and disposition of the bank
to abuse its influence The bank íepresented all
the distiess which pervaded the community as
lesultmg from a measuie of the President—from
the temoval of eight or nine millions fiom us
vaults Mr S , in answer to the views piesented
by the faends of the bank on this point, read a
letter written by the Piesident of the bank, ex-
plaining the causes of public embariassments
which existed at a time when the bink could not
complain of the conduct of the President of the
United States, or his Secretary of the Treasury
Mr Biddle represented the distress, at that time,
as arising fiom over tiadmg, brought on by over-
banking The same mi>ans, he went on to show,
had produced the present state of things He
lefeue I to a statement, which he was willing to
take as true, that the bank had withdrawn from
cnculation only four mill, ons of dollars Thiswas
a Miflicient "roof that the removal of the deposites
to the Sta'e banks, which continued to use those
ueposites for the benefit of the people, could not
have produced any embarrassment But it was
siid that tne removal, per se, hid rot produced the
<ffect, but that the panic and loss of confidence
consequenton the íemoval, had produced it. But
who p-oduced the panic' Not the State banks,
for they would be the fiist to suffet by it Not the
people, certa nly, foi they are its victims But it
was the United Sta'es B\nk which created all this
i larm and agitation Without greatly reducing
the amrint of then discounts, they could pioduce
agiistionby diminishing then faciht es at ore point
and mcreiomg them st another, subjecting every
place, in succession, to their influence     Mi   S
vindicated the Secretary of the Treasury from the
aspersions cast upon him, eulogizing his character
in warm terms
When Mi  S concluded,
The floor was obtained by Mr ELLSWORTH,
who moved that the House adjourn
The question being taken by yeas and nays, the
motion was negaMved.
Yeas G4, nays 66
Mr CLAYTON moved a call of the House;
upon which motion Mi EVANS demanded the
yeas and navs, which Were ordered
Mi McCO MAS moved that tne House do now
adjourn
On this motion Mr GILLET demanded the
yeas and nays, which were ordered
Mr ELLSWORTH lose to explain that h* had
moved an adjournment, after obtaining the floor,
because, not expeeting to speak to day, he was
not prepared with the papers which he should
have occasion to use m addressing the House
Mr HARDIN said he had voted against the
adjournment, and he wished to give a reason why
he should now change his vote
The SPEAKER decided that no explanations
were in order.
The question on the motion to adjourn was
taken by yeas and nays, and decided in the affirm-
ative
Yeas 70, nays 62
The House adjourned
IN SENATE
Tuesdiy, March 27, 1834.
On motion of Mi S1LSBEE, leave of absence
for ten days after Monday next was granted to
Mr WEBSTER
Mr KING, of Georgia, presented a memorial
fiom. about four hundred citizens of the city of
Augusta, asking a íestoration of the deposites, and
a recharterof the Bank of the United States
Mr K said that as, from the proceedings of
yesterday, he found it was still usual, on the pre-
sentation of memonals, to speak of the charactei
of the memorialists, and, at the same time, to say
something upon the subject of their complaints—
although hedisappioved the practice of discussing
these memorials, and thought the compliments of
respectability, &c , as merely formal ceremonies—
yet, as the practice was continued, he could not
consent that his fellow-citizens of Augusta, and
their memonal, should suffer too much in com-
parison with those fiom various other quarters
and sections of the Union, by refusing to bestow
upon them something like the accustomed atten-
tion
He said, then, he could state that he was per-
sonally acquainted with a very large poition of the
memorialists, and he thought that, to a limited
extent, they embraced all classes, characters,
trades, piofessions, and interests, in the commu-
nity from which the memorial came He said he
also found that a very íespectable portion of the
merchants and business men of the city had signed
the memorial, sfnd from his acquaintance with
some of them, he thought then experience and
general intelligence as merchants qualified them
as well to judge of those measures of State policy
which would likely improve or injure then respect-
ive mteiests as a like number of merchants taken
promiscuously from any other southern city m the
Union
Of the politics of the memorialists, however, he
said he could not say so much. He was not
extensively acquainted with the political opinions
and feelings of his neighbois He did not know
whether they were generally friendly, or opposed
to the present Administration But from the best
information he could gam, the memorial was not
onginated, circulated, signed, or sent here, with
a,ny -very marked reference to party distinctions
upon this point He might, perhaps, he said,
make this exception There was, he said, aveiy
small, but at the same time a very respectable
party in the city of Augusta, (known as the nul-
lifying paity,) who, with a consistency with their
formei opinions upon the subject of the United
States Bank, (which, so far from censurm -, he
was much disposed to adm.re,) had generally, he
believed, declined to put their signatures to tha
paper
There was one chaiacteristic, however, he said,
by which he thought the memorial might be dis-
tinctly marked So far as he was acquainted with
the sentiments of the memorialists, they had been
geneially friendly to a United States Bank They
thought such an institution an useful instrument
in the commerce of the country, and an efficient
aid to the Government in the administration of its
finances The chaiacter and objects of the me-
morial, he said, might in fact be gathered from the
language employed in it, which had been appro-
priately selected, and showed an evident intention
in the memorialists to state nothing but the truth;
but at the same time to state that in such a way
as to forward, as far as possible, the object they
had in v.ew They spoke of "Indications" of
d'stiess in the commercial community, of" evils
which they witness," and of still greater evils
whicn the/apprehend,&c. They nowhere point-
edly state, said Mr K , that they are themselves
suffering under any very unusual pecuniary em-
barrassment or pressure in their money market.
Tney could not so state, he said, as he apprehended
such statement would have been contrary to the
fact The very mail, he said, which brought the
memorial, brought the prices current, by which it
appeared that local stocks, (al waysthe thermometer
of the money market, as they were not influenced
by any foreign competition,) and in fact all vendable
articles usually stated in the prices cunent, main-*
tamed their prices, and indicated that all those who
had the worth of money could procure money on
the usual and customary terms Herefeired, also,
to the proceedings of the meeting, by which it was
admitted, he believed, by the speakers on both
sides, that the pressure had not thev reached the
city If further evidence were wanting, he said
he could state that he had conversed with two of
the memorialists themselves, both highly respectable
merchants, who had stated to him that the present
season had not been marked by any unusual dis-
tress among the merchants. And, (said Mr. K.,)
if Senators should still be incredulous, I hold in
my hand a letter from one of the committee who
drafted the memorial itself, a line from which, he
supposed, would conclusively settle this point.
Among other things the writer states- " As yet,
our money market is about as we left it."
Mr K said he was thus paiticular in dwelling
on these facts, not only to show the true character
of the memorial and its object, but to sustain his
colleague in a declaration he had made a few weeks
past, that at thai time the city of Augusta was suf-
feung no unusual distress The truth of this
statement had been questioned by some honorable
Senators, and particularly the honorable Senator
from Kentucky had laughed at his colleague fcr
this supposed mistake The statement of Ivs col-
league, he said, was strictly true at the time it was
made, and in fact so continued up to the date of
the last accounts.
But (said Mi. K ) it is true the memorialists
apprehend distress, and he thought with some
reason, if he understood well the present state of
affairs in that city. This pressure (said Mr K )
has been almost periodical in, the southern cities
for several years, and may always be expected, to
a ceitam extent, when the article of cotton opens
at a price much beyond that which is aftei wards
maintained. It is known (said Mr K.) that north-
ern exchange is principally furnished to southern
merchants by the purchase and shipment of cotton.
These are the means by and through which the
southern merchants pay their northern debts.
And when the trade continues regular throughout
the season, the supply is generally equal to, and
sometimes beyond the demand, and the premium
on northein exchange is often a tufle, and some-
times nothing But (said he) the planters., after
they have sold a portion of their crop at good
prices, sell the remainder with extreme reluctance
at prices very far below what they have previously
obtained. Every man (he said) at all in the habit
of attending to the operations of his own mmd,
would understand the policy by which the planter
was governed in such a case
In fact, the planter was not only inclined, but
enabled, during the present season, by a timely
disposition of a large portion of his crop, at good
pries, to hold on to the lena ndc-, m expectation
