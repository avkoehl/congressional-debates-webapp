CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
and to demand that the manner of conducting elections should
tie satisfactory in this respect
Mr POPE (after a remark not heard by the Reporter) said,
according to the Constitution each State was entitled to e'eot
Representatives m the same way as under the Confederation
There was no clause in the Constitution against which more
jealousy was displayed than against the clause relative to the
places and manner of holding elections, as it was feared that
Congress might mtei fere with the power of the States The
convention, fearing that some actien, or want of action, on the
part of the Stale Governments, might embarrass 01 defeat tt e
action of this Government, inserted the provision m this clause
of the Constitution, that the States should have the dutv of
fixing the times, place* and manner of holding elections, but
Congres' might, (not should,) if necessary and proper to pre
serve the Government, nterfeie on this subject T! e dtsunc
tlon was between the mandatory style m the one case, an u the
discretionary power in the other
Mr P read from General Hamilton's exposition of this ar
tide of the Constitution m coi formation of the view he had
taken of the subject He contended that this Government ought
never to act on a subject over which there was State contiol,
without a striking necessity for it Such action tended to con
eolidation The power over this subject -40 id in the States
previous to the Constitution, an independen' power The
Constitution said the States bhould act, and the General Gov
eminent might act on it If toe States had acted, wheie, he
•would a«k, did Congress derive the po<ver of directing the
States to reveise their action?
The power contended (or by the gentleman from Maryland
[Mr W C Johnson] was such ashe had never beard of before
It was not only the powei in the General Government to act it
sell, but to duett the arates to loas it w shed
Mr WVI COA! 'UHN-ON said he had taken the ground
that Congress had the power lo say whether the States should
¿e represented by single districts or not, and that this
was a aetiltd question Tht only question for Congress to
examine was Hit, question of expediency He had not gone
into the other question, whether the General G ivernment
should parcel out the vanousdistr ctsonll e irapof die States,
or not He believed it was only necessary for Congress to say
that the States should adopt the general district system, and it
would not fail at once to b" adopted II the Mates failed to do
it, they wouldonly loso their Kepiesentauves on th s door ani
no State would be willing to be unrepiesenttd simply because
Congress had designated the single district system, and she was
opposed to it
Mr POPE said if they undertook to direct the States as to
the distncts they liad a right to direct them as to the manner
of the disti icts All the arguments which h id been mtrt duced

should be any a fference of opinion as to ne power off o lgress
to adopt the amendment, f here migb be a question a* to its
wpe&iicy
The gentleman from Maryland [Mr W C Jobsson) had
also taken the same view as to the authority of Congress, and
was m favor of the district system, for reasons to his(^r Fs)
mind utterly unanswerable, s'lll the gentleman was not to vote
for the amendment, for a íeason which ought to contiol tne
pov, rfuLargumentsif the constitutional powei and great ex
pedieney of adopting the amendment, viz that there should be
a combination against the bill ol those -who were in favor of a
high íatio, and those opposed to the amerdment itself This was
the very reason why they wanted the aid of every gentleman
behevine in the constitutionality and expediency of this matter
Mi WM COST JQHP>¡-ON explained that hu. principal
argument was, that he was in favor of a low ratio, and hy add
ing this amendment to the bill, it would defeat it He was for
making no obstruction whatever to the bill, as many of the
S ate Legisiatuies were soon to convene to act on it He be
lieved both measures would pa5s moie rapidly if separate, and,
for appearance'sake, he would not vote for the amendment,
when he knew it would defeat the very obj ct he wished to ac
comphsh
Mi PENDLETON said, if the argument of the gentleman
was go id, that theiewouid bt a comb nation asamstthe bill, it
the amendment wasauOfte! of tho^e who weie m favor of a
high ratio and those who were against the amendment itself it
was cqua ly ti ue mat there would be a combination in favor of
the bill o those who went foi alow latio an 1 those «ho favored
tht amendment The centleman lrom ^ew York before him,
[Vfi Davis ] who was m favoi of a low i tío, would rote loi
the bill
Mr DAVIS was undeistood to say that although he was in
favor of a ow ratio he cou 1 not vote for this amendment
Mr PENDLETON said he had supposed si a id had brought
this foi wartl to show the fallacy of the argument of the gentle
man from Maryland
Mr P briefly replied to the oi jecuons of the gentlemen from
NewYorkpir Ployd] and Georgia [Mr COLGtxiTT] against the
a'op'ion of the general district «ystem, and further contended
that the power over the oubiect existed m Congres-, and it was
thfcir imperative duly to exercise it whenever the ( roper occa
sion existed
The gentleman from Kentucky [Mr Pope] had said, and
placed great emp las s on it, that this authority was given by
the Constitution to the General Government, as the means of
self preservation, andth*t it should not be exercised until the
States Vad entirely filled to legislate on IbpsuhjfCt He (Mi
P) said that the authority given to Congress to alter, prebup
posed action by the State Legislatures on the measures to be al
teredby Congress and itwap not necessary foi tbeaenon of Con
gress that the fe'a es should have entirely failed rr neglected to
legislate on the subject, but only that fhen legislation should be

was not to tl row a  t tte out of the pale of the union as soon
as she thought her rights invaded, but to maintain her rights
within it
t Such a course hy Indiana was greatly to he deprecated, and,
if taken would be greatly to be deplored But what would be
the utultt Just this—that Indiana would be deprived of her
representation on the floor of Congress or else the contingency
havirg occurredfor which the power in the fouith article of
the C institution was given, (viz a S ate having refused to act,)
Cong] ees would be undei tl e necessity of takn g aetion in the
emt rgencv, on the great principle of self presei vation
Mr P said a few wouls as to the ground taken by the gentle
man from Kentarky [Mr Pope ] whom he characteuzed as
a hold man in assurnns the positions he had lone bu' remind
ed him thai to be fei-iess of dangei was no proof that danger
did not exist but on the contraiy, wis often itself the most
fiuitful source of danger— safety was one thing senility an

"lung to a unin of the States and his proportional dread of
whatevir threatened it He was wilhnsto al e all the compro

nument H- insisted that there n vei had been a time m
w nch it was nore desirab e that the attachment of the people
to their Government should he cherished mi confirmed he he
I eved tha the cflect of the amendment would be to do this, and
h  was pn paie 1, on that ground as well as others, to give his
vote in us favor
Mr EVERETT ( hough, as usual, but imperfectly heard at
tne re| oitei's seat) was understood to say that there had been
a time when he should have been very anxious to reply to the
argument ofthe gentleman from Georgia [Mr Colquitt,) but
that lime had gone by 1 he amendment was proposed simply
as providing a rule of uniformity on the subject of elections
The rule wass fair one, and it executed itself, became, if any
State did not con foi m itself to the rule, it would lose Its repre-
sentation on the floor of Congress As to the question of power,
Mr E was content to rely on the argument of the gentleman
from New York, [Mr Barnard ] which established these two
points first, that whatever power the States had in this matter,
they got from the Constitution and, second, that whatever
power the States had, Congi ess had also, for it possessed the
light to supersede and ride over the legislation of the States in
regard to it, and he agreed with that gentleman as to the ques-
tion of fact, that the practical administration of this Govern
ment ever had been, andei er must continue tobe, in the hands
of a political party The question then recurred, was this rule
of uniformity, as proposed in the amendment, a good rule?
None had denied that the dislnct system was a proper mode of
electing Representatives-, not a single man had pretended that
the general ticket system ought to be established as a general
rule The rule, if made general, must go to array States
asamst States, and section against section of the Union, and was
pregnant with the most threatening dangeia He considered
the'district p'an as essential 10 the pe-re and well being of the
union What was, m fact, our safe'y now? Only this-
that the States were so divided m opinion, that the portions
were balanced against each other, and neutralized each other's
strength
Ihe rule being confessedly good in itself, the next question
was, whether there exis e I any necessity for Its adoption It
was the interest of the latg" States to have the b>8tem it was
the interest of the smaller States not to have it, provided they
could have any security that the laige ¡states would adopt It
It had neen ptonounc"d an odious rule, and the advocates of
the amendmer t had been chanted with attempting to introduce
and enforce an od ous and oppressive regulation Did they for-
get that twas heru'e wh ch a'ready prevailed in nineteen out
of the twenty uc fetales of the Union? Seven States elected by
geneial ticket and their united votes were thirty one, while
those of the nine een < ther ¡>iate3 were two hundred and eleven
Now, on my po'uiea! cues ion how did they stand? In these
seven fetates, tha vt et Most' lift one But hew was it m the
foul larse States of isew Yont, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Vir
ginial New Yoh, with forty votes, told but as two Ohio,
with nineteen votes told hut a*s five while Pennsylvania, with
twenty eight votes ml Virginia, with twen'y one, told but as
two each Here, then four States, whose votes, if by general
ticket, would count as one hu dred and eight, m consequence
of the district system, told but as eleven The general
ticket system was adopted by some of the smal'er States, be-
cause it gave them political powei over the larger and wl /
had not tne larger Sta es then countervailed this measure, by
doing the same? Partly fiom the influence of moral principle
and a regard to the geneial good, and partly on considerations
of convenience The ijea, however had been broacheo, and
it was possible n migh' ere long be adopted, and if n was, the
smaller States must be swallowed up, in which case, the Union
could not be expected long to endui e
Mr E had been much struck and not a little surprised, at
the strenuous opposition n tnifestett toward the amendment
lorn States mar lies'Jy interested in ha^mg it adopted Among
tl c most surpusi is:oi uie&e phenomena was the opposition of
his friend from Moine, [Mr Ct lvpaan [ hut the riddle was
solved in a moment on learning as ne Í ad since done, that the
Legislature of Maine ha 1, esse J a law oeclarmg that if such a
number should be adopted as would preserve tt Maine exactly
eight Congressional districts the district system should prevail,
but if either more oi lest were required, then the general ticket
should be reported to
Mr CI IF FORD said, as reference had been made to the re
centacton if the legislature of Meine upon this subject, ho
wished o saya wo d in explanation He entertainelno doubt
that the people of that state p ef ried Congicsslo al districts
to the "enera1 ticket sys em, ard that the futuie action of the
State would beat himoutin the statemen as its past action had
airead} d ne It was ir e hat a r"c°nt act of that State pro-
vi led lot the election of eignt n embers by dlstr cte, and, m
case any other number be fixed by Congress, it provided for a
genera! ticket at the ensuing election 1 his was a temporary
provision, adopted from the necessity of the case, to avoid the
expense of an extra session, in consequence of the neglect of
Congress to fix he rano at an earlier day, as it might weil have
done befoie the usual time of the adjournment of the Mame
Legislatur" This was not done altloughhe urged this consid
eration upon the House when the bill was reported The Legis-
lature of lhat State, theiefur  had no alternative but to act in
the manner they did, or to let the whole subiect pass over
1 hey very properly, as it seemed to him, adopted the former
course He would, however.say that, if rumor could be relied
on, there was sume reason to be! eve that the Governor of that
btate would deem it ath isable to convene the Legislature at an
early day, for another purpose, for reasons which have been
communicated to him within a few dajs las past, andif such
should be the case, ho had very little doubt but that all parties
would concur in the propriety of vaiymg the Corgressmnal
districts to accord with the new ratio
Mr EVERETfsaUhewas very glad to hear what the gen-
t'eman stated and as it acpeared that Maine went so strongly
for the distuct system, he hoped to have the gentleman's vote
foi the amendment
Mr CLIFFORD    Never
Mr HALSTED rt se to address the committee, but finding
that Mr Ferr s had done the same, he offered to yield the
floor    It was finally arranced that Mr H should proceed
He then en ered on a geneial =peecc in defence of the amend
ment he had, by dnection of the Committee of Elections pro
I osed for adoption, and in reply to the objections by which it
had in various quarters been as«ailed He ai ranged his remarks
so as to apply fiist to the origin of the amei dment, secondly
to the motives which had induced the committee to report it to
the House, and then to the objections urged against it. The
amen ¡ment had originated from a r solution m'-oduced by Mr
Catoeeia, of South Caiolma, on the 14th of Maich, m the fnl

to irqune into the expediency of providing by law for uni-
formity in elections (or Kepiesentatives to Congress bv the

He disclaimed all influence of party considerations in brine
mg this measure into the House it was no rjarty move; none
would charge it as such on the original mover, and the imDar
tial and disinterested course thus far of the Committee of Elec
tlons forbade that such an imputation should be cast upon them
