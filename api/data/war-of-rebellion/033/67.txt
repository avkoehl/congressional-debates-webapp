await his orders. I understand, unofficially, that the order resulted from the representations of the Congressional delegation and others of the abuses of the provost-marshal system in parts of the State where there was no military force nor any necessity for one.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General-in-Chief.

Major-General CURTIS,Commanding Department:

GENERAL: I send up an aide for dispatches. Warren has just reported to me by letter. Marmaduke went down Bryant's Fork on the 14th. Part of my cavalry are in his rear. Some prisoners have been brought, who report Hindman at Oil Trough Bottom, near Batesville.

My last train of supplies ought to be here in four of five days. The roads are most horrible. Warren has been ordered to come here leaving escort sufficient for his train. We now wait your orders, when and where to move.

Most truly and respectfully,

J. W. DAVIDSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FISK'S BRIGADE, U. S. VOLUNTEERS, Helena, January 22, 1863.

Major-General CURTIS, Saint Louis:

MY DEAR GENERAL: I am just returned from the White River, and am organizing my command for Vicksburg. I go to-night. We shall take Vicksburg sure, even though all the Confederacy should be there to oppose it. Our expedition to Devall's Bluff has not been productive of great results; some expeditions are not. I have done all I could in my weak way to crowd a force up the Arkansas while the Vicksburg expedition was being organized; in this I am opposed all around. I called upon Admiral Porter yesterday to press the proposition upon him, now while the river is full to its banks; no go. Perhaps it is best it should not be done.

I remain, yours, to command,CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
