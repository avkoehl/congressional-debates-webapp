HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS,Devall's Bluff, September 3, 1864-8.30 a. m.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Little Rock:

The expedition got off soon after sunrise this morning. The time taken in wooding prevented their starting sooner. I sent every effective man of the infantry here except the Fifty-seventh Colored, in all about 1,100. The Dove is expected with some of the Saint Charles troops, and perhaps I will send her up if she gets along in season. These steam-boat men, many of them, are disloyal, and are quite tardy in forwarding such expeditions.

Very respectfully,

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF LITTLE ROCK,Little Rock, Ark., September 3, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER THIRD KANSAS BATTERY:

SIR: By direction of the brigadier-general commanding you will move camp to the south of the river and establish yourself near the unfinished earth-works northeast of the penitentiary, near the river bank. Your guns will be put in position so as to command the approaches through the valleys west of the city. The One hundred and twelfth and One hundred and thirteenth Colored Troops are camped near by and will serve as support to your battery.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WASHINGTON, September 3, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Orders have been given to mount the Seventeenth Illinois Cavalry. You will immediately send to Generals Curtis the Second Regiment Colorado Cavalry. Report the time of its departure.

SAINT LOUIS, September 3, 1864.

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

Your dispatch received. Brown has orders to send Second Colorado, now out after guerrillas, as soon as it can be relieved. The sub-district occupied by it cannot be abandoned without fearful injury to the inhabitants and public interest.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
