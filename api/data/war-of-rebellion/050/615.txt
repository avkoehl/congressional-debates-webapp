educated, and in everything competent to command,and is deserving of a commission.

The same may be said of George C. James, private Company A, Sixth Ohio Volunteers, clerk to my chief of artillery and topographical engineer, who, when detailed as a clerk, stipulated to join his regiment when on a march with the prospect of an engagement. On the march from Murfreesborough to Manchester he joined his regiment, and also from the time of crossing the Tennessee River until the termination of the late engagements, in both of which he participated. If promotion cannot be had in their regiments, some distinguishing mark of honor should be bestowed on both of these men.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. L. CRITTENDEN,

Major-General, Commanding Twenty-first Army Corps.

Lieutenant Colonel C. GODDARD,

A. A. G., Dept. of the Cumberland, Chattanooga, Tenn.
