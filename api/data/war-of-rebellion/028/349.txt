Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Asst. Adjt. General, Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

Telegram of last night received this morning. It occurs to me that at least a part of the confusion caused by the new numbers of the corps arises from the fact that you have got them wrong. Sigel's corps is the Eleventh, Banks' is the Twelfth, and Hooker's (late McDowell's) is the First Corps. This is warranted correct, the newspapers to the contrary notwithstanding. Consequently, after some puzzling, I infer from your telegram that Meade commands the First Corps, vice Hooker, wounded, and A. S. Williams commands the Twelfth Corps, vice Mansfield, killed. Is this right? To whom was Weber's brigade assigned? Is Couch's division independent? Does Sturgis command Reno's division, and Willcox, Stevens'? Piatt's brigade is here, in Whipple's division.

Request about General Orders, Numbers 157, will be attended to. Had a splendid distribution list, answering for both of us, in type when your dispatch came.
