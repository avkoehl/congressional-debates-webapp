I will only add that if we have a co-operating army acting with us on the line of the railroad, or possibly even on the James River, the necessity of works of defense would be greatly reduced.

In throwing together these thoughts, I have had no idea of criticizing the operations of the Army of the Potomac in its former campaign, nor am I presumptuous enough to suppose that they will be the means of entirely changing the plan of the operations now before it; but I could not well develop my idea of the importance of having good military roads, and their feasibility in the present position of the army, without thinking of what I had seen in the Peninsula, or without selecting a point from which the proposed roads may be built.

If you think these observations possess any merit, I will be obliged to you will forward them to the major-general commanding the army.*

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. S. ALEXANDER,

Lieutenant-Colonel, and Aide-de-Camp.

+ Approximate. Hancock's division omitted in " present for duty equipped" on original return, which gives 20,293. General Hancock says (p. 228) that his maximum strength taken into action was 5,006.
