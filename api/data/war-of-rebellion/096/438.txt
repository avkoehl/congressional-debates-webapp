HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 6, 1865-9.13 a.m.

Major-General PARKE:

General Gregg went to Dinwiddie, and captured there 18 wagons and 50 prisoners, including 1 colonel General Warren crossed as ordered and went to Hargrave's. General Humphreys went to the crossing of Vaughan road and Armstrong's Mill. It was found difficult to communicate down the Vaughan road with Warren, and much delay was caused by this. Hill massed in front of Humphreys' right, and at 4.15 p.m. attacked vigorously with Heth's division in two lines, supported by Gordon's division, of Early's corps, and Mahone's division. Smyth and McAllister, of Humphreys' corps, repulsed two attacks handsomely. This morning Warren has been moved to connect with Humphreys to drive Hill back. Gregg has come up the Vaughan road with Warren. This force is ordered now to move on Hill and drive him into his works. Wheaton and Hartranft have joined Humphreys. At the time of the attack upon Humphreys, Warren was at J. Hargrave's, on road to Dinwiddie, and Gregg was at Malone's Crossing.

HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,February 6, 1865. (Received 9.50 a.m.)

Bvt. Major General A. S. WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

The Engineer Brigade reported last night. It is posted about the center of my line between the Avery and Shands houses. Colonel Brainerd reports its strength at about 1,500 men. He reported from City Point there were about 1,900 men, but on arriving here he informed me that he had to leave many guards at City Point, thus reducing his strength.
