Major R. S. SMITH, U. S. Army, Madison, Wis.

MAJOR: I will be much obliged to you if you can furnish me with the names and designation of the prisoners of war who died or escaped from Camp Randall. It is quite doubtful whether you will be able to do so, but I have thought it possible that some of the books belonging to the camp or hospital may be in your possession, or the quartermaster, from which the information may be obtained. I will send you some blank rolls.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
