tages obtained from them; if otherwise, the loss will be insignificant in itself, and will probably be a gain eventually, by preventing future experiments in the same line, and settling the question of the largest effective caliber for sea-coast cannon.

The armies in the field have been amply supplied with good and effective arms, equipments, and ammunition, and the armament of the fortifications of the country has been kept in good order and strengthened during the past year. No effort will be spared to continue the same and to improve the quality and efficiency of ordnance supplies for the future.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. B. DYER,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Ordnance.
