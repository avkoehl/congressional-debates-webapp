evidently making for the Ohio. Shackelford is only 5 miles behind, and Major Rue with cavalry in front. We hope to get him yet.

Major-General.

STEUBENVILLE, July 24, 1863.

General BURNSIDE, Cincinnati, Ohio:

Morgan is reported within 10 miles of Cadiz. I have infantry here ready to move either in that direction or down the river, but the troops ordered to stop at Coshocton ought to come on at once to Cadiz Junction. Major Rue has gone to Bellaire, where he will feed and water his horses.

Major-General.

JULY 24, 1863.

General BROOKS, Steubenville:

Your troops are now in good position to move according to circumstances, and it will be well to hold them in readiness. I think Morgan will take the road from Antrum for Sunfish, on this river, below Wheeling. If so, Major Rue will intercept him. I will send Major Way and his force up as rapidly as possible, and will direct him to report to you from Cadiz Junction. Please send any information you may get.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

STEUBENVILLE, July 24, 1863.

Governor BOREMAN, Wheeling, W. Va.:

The indications are that Morgan is moving north yet. Let the boats, with artillery, ply down the river toward Sunfish.

Major-General.

STEUBENVILLE, July 24, 1863.

Colonel [GEORGE H.] BEMUS, On Train at Mingo:

Stop with your regiment at La Grange Station, and keep a good lookout for the roads leading into Ohio.

W. T. H. BROOKS,

Major-General.

STEUBENVILLE, July 24, [1863.]

Colonel [JAMES R.] PORTER, On Train at Mingo:

I want you to proceed with your regiment of Portland Station. At that point two roads diverge out into the interior of Ohio. I want you to watch them well, and see that Morgan does not get in to the river on them. Colonel Bemus will stop with his regiment at La Grange Station.

W. T. H. BROOKS,

Major-General.
