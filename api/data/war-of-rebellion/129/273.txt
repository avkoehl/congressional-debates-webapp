impressed. Yet under ordinary circumstances, when family or extra-blooded horses or brood mares of admitted high value are impressed, we respectfully suggest to the Secretary of War to have instructions forwarded to the impressing officers to propose and allow the owners to substitute in their stead such strong, sound, and serviceable horses or mules as shall be considered and valued by competent and disinterested parties as first-class artillery horses or first-class wagon mules.

The term "average value per head" is in contradistinction to a fixed and uniform price for each horse or mule. We supposed that in impressing a number of horses or mules, whether owned by several persons or one individual, that some might be estimated at $300 and others at different advanced rates, according to their worth, up as high as $700-thus making an average value or price for a number of good, sound, and efficient horses or mules $500 each.

In illustration of our views, we will add, that a horse with only one eye sound might, in all other respects, be classed as a first-class artillery horse, yet the loss of one eye would justly and considerably curtail his value. So a horse from ten to eighteen years of age might be deemed in all other particulars as a first-class artillery horse, but of course, however efficient or able to render good service for a year or so, yet his advanced age would justly and materially impair his value. Any horse, however he may approximate the standard of a first-class artillery horse, must, according to deficiencies, fall below the maximum price; and as few comparatively come up to the standard, and therefore are entitled to the maximum price, so of course in all other instances the price should be proportionately reduced, as imperfections place them below the standard of first class, &amp;c.

REVISION OF THE SCHEDULE OF FEBRUARY AND MARCH LAST.

Since the adoption of our last schedules for the months of February and March the financial bills passed by Congress, taxing the currency, have seriously impaired the value of the old issues of Confederate Treasury notes. At this juncture large numbers of horses and mules were impressed and paid for in a currency which was in a few days thereafter to be taxed 33 1/3 per cent.

The Board of State Commissioners having adjourned, and one of its members being out of the State, it could not be convened in time to review our schedules of prices. Under this state of facts we have re-examined and rearranged our tariff of prices, so far as we have been advised of recent impressments, proposing, in this mode, to remedy any diminution of valuation which may have resulted
