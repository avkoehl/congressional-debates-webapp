The steamer Allison will go to Washington on Monday afternoon. Mr. Wiswell and any such people, General Palmer says, may go. He wishes you to go in command. Orders have been issued to-day for the Twenty-third New York Cavalry to come at once to New Berne, bring all their traps, and report to Colonel Savage, Twelfth New York Cavalry, who, it is believed, will make them effective. Don't wait to receive the order, as it will not get down until Monday, but start them off as soon as practicable.
