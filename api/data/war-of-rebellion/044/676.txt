came under my notice where any one flinched from the post of danger. Where all behaved so well, it is difficult to draw distinctions, yet being nearest the company of Lieutenant Wallace, I can bear especial testimony to the coolness and gallantry of himself and men. I cannot forbear also paying a tribute to the handsome conduct of my ordnance officer (Lieutenant [M. H.] Houston), who exposed himself frequently to the hottest fire, and assisted in working at one of the guns. Saturday, the 4th, the same position was maintained with but little firing, and on the afternoon of that day, under orders from General Hill, I withdrew to Stone bridge, and awaited there the body of the corps, with which I moved to the village of Fairfield. Ordered here to report go General Anderson with two batteries, which I did, moving with his division across the mountain before dark, leaving a section on the top of the Emmitsburg road, and sending a battery at night with a regiment of Posey's brigade, to take position on the hill overlooking Waynesborough. Monday, the 5th, moved with the main column to Hagerstown, and sent one battery to picket with Anderson's and one with Lane's division. On the 11th instant, moved with General Anderson's division into line of battle, and took position designated near Saint James' College, which, strong of itself, was well intrenched, but occupied without battle till the evening of the 13th, when I withdrew at dark, by your order, moving to Williamsport, and thence to Falling Waters, over the worst road and during the worst night of the season. The river was reached and crossed in safety about 9 a. m., the caissons having been sent on before, under Lieutenant [B. Z.] Price, who conveyed them all safely to camp, about a mile and a half from the river. The Whitworth guns, under Captain Hurt, were put in position near the bridge by General Pendleton, and several shots were fired from them at columns of the enemy's cavalry. Captain Hurt, withdrawing by another road, rejoined the battalion at Bunker Hill. From Bunker Hill the battalion moved with General Anderson's division to Culpeper Court-House. Annexed is a statement of casualties, with amount of ammunition expended. Casualties in men-Killed and wounded, 24; captured, 16. * Casualties in horses-Disabled and killed, 38. From the battle of Gettysburg to the time of reaching Culpeper Court-House, the horses received no corn, subsisting entirely upon grass, with a little sheaf oats and wheat.
