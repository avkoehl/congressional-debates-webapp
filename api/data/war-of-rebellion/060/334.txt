HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., January 3, 1864.

Colonel RODGERS,

Martinsburg, W. Va.:

Major Bell's report proves to be untrue. Early and Imboden are yet near Winchester. My troops have not occupied the town or been in it. At 10 a. m. to-morrow start a cavalry force of 100 men to co-operate with a force sent from Charleston, and give them written orders to proceed to Winchester and see the force of the enemy stationed there. The prisoners brought in say that Early's intention was to attack Martinsburg. I advise you to be on the alert. Show this to General Averell.

Brigadier-General.

Captain BOONE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I had anticipated yours, and sent 50 cavalry to Bunker Hill at 2 a. m. At 10 a. m. I sent 50 more to join them. They will proceed to Winchester as ordered. General Averell learned at 1 a. m. from commanding officer at Sir John's Run of Early, Imboden, and Rosser being in Winchester last night. This force reported at 10,700.

Scouts returned 9 miles until met by the party sent from here at 10 a. m., when both started for Winchester at 2 this p. m.

Brigadier-General CULLUM,

Chief of Staff:

My cavalry from the Ferry, under Colonel Boyd, entered Winchester at 3 p. m., capturing a few prisoners. Lee's, Rosser's, and Walker's brigades of infantry have gone westward. Early has about 5,000 infantry near Middletown, excepting Meade to cross at Front Royal or higher up. One of Imboden's aides read a dispatch that effect this morning and was overheard. About 800 cavalry are between Winchester and Middletown. My cavalry will attack them.

I have a deserter from General Lee who reports the following, which, by permission of General Kelley, I send direct to you: Mosby is in Loundon. He has, besides his own men, two companies - the
