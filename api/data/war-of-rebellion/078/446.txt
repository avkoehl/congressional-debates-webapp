HEADQUARTERS THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION,Camp Crooks, Ga., September 23, 1864-11 p. m.

Captain J. E. JACOBS,

Assistant Adjutant-General to Chief of Cavalry:

CAPTAIN: I have just received word from the scouting party, Second DIVISION. Captain Greeno, commanding detachment, reports that he found the enemy's pickets about two miles this side of Davis' Ferry, six miles south of Campbellton; he drove them in, capturing 2 belonging to Ferguson's brigade. The prisoners report a pontoon bridge across the river at a ferry this side of Moore's Bridge, about sixteen miles south of Davis' Ferry. They also report a corps of infantry there (General Stewart's command), and say that Armstrong, with his brigade, crossed the river day before yesterday for the purpose of cutting our railroad; had crowbars and picks along. General Ross' brigade is also with Ferguson, with six pieces of artillery. General Hood's headquarters are reported to be at some point on WEST Point railroad. This confirm the reports from my scouts forwarded to you last evening. Jackson's DIVISION of cavalry has certainly crossed the Chattahoochee, and all the report go to show that the object is to strike our railroad.

All quiet along my line up to this hour.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
