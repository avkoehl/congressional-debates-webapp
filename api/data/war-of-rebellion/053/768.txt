ATHENS, [October 20, 1863]-4 a. m.

Major J. J. REEVE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

We arrived at this place at 10 o'clock, and are awaiting the artillery. The road is very muddy at places. I met this dispatch,* and I took the liberty of opening if. I think it best to await Colonel Morrison's movement, as my advancing in front might cause a retreat and loss of everything.

I have sent 3 very reliable men on to Sweet Water to report to me 3 miles this side. I have a line of couriers kept on the road to your headquarters.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

G. G. DIBRELL,

Colonel, &c.
