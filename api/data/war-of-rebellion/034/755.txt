CINCINNATI, July 15, 1863-6.45 p. m.

General WILLCOX, Indianapolis:

Let the militia of Indiana be disbanded at once, and allowed to go to their homes, if it is in accordance with the wishes of Governor Morton. I am satisfied that their services will no longer be needed in this emergency, and their interest at home need looking after.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, July 15, 1863.

Governor MORTON, Indianapolis:

I have directed General Willcox to dispense with the State militia, if it is in accordance with your views, and I believe the emergency for which they were called out has passed, and their interests at home require looking after.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, July 15, 1863.

Governor TOD, Columbus:

The chairman of military committee of Highland County says they need two thousand arms, with ammunition, for the militia already organized in that vicinity. We have issued all we have. Can you send them? They should have them immediately, if possible, Morgan is closely followed by heavy force. I have ordered roads obstructed with trees, and planking of bridges removed in his front, so as to enable our troops to overtake him. the militia along the line of the Marietta road should have first supply of arms and ammunition after Highland, so that if he turns north, he may find them prepared. The militia assembling at Gallipolis are directed to remain there till further orders.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.

CINCINNATI, July 15, 1863.

J. G. DAMERON, Mayor of Gallipolis:

The militia of Gallipolis may remain in that vicinity. If Morgan should be heard of as positively moving in that direction, they must be used to fell timber into the roads and remove planking of bridges, so as to delay him till our troops can overtake him. Show this to the militia commanders as authority. We do not think Morgan will get across the Scioto; but if he does, the directions above should be spread every where and carried out by the militia and people.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

JULY 16, 1863.

HAMILTON GRAY, Maysville:

Please send a perfectly reliable man to communicate with Hobson, and to tell him that a force has gone up to impede Morgan. Write nothing. Let him return at once, and report by telegraph.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
