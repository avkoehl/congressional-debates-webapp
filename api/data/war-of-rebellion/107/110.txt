also called in the companies at work near De Hart's battery. A few moments after receiving this order the enemy opened on us with scattering shell. In a short time General Seymour arrived and informed me that he had given Lieutenant-Colonel McIntire orders to remain out near Mechanicsville and use three of his companies as skirmishers and one as a reserve, and directing me at the same time to deploy two companies, one on the right and one on the left of De Hart's battery for its support. Company D (Captain Hess) was at once thrown out on the right, and Company G (Captain Dobson) on the left. He also directed me to throw the remaining companies of the regiment in the rear of some temporary shelter in camp, which I did. These dispositions had scarcely been completed when Lieutenant-Colonel McIntire arrived with Companies B (Captain Barton) and H (Captain Dwin), having sent the other two companies (I, Captain Kaufman, and K, Lieutenant Sadler) in advance for the purpose of supporting a section of Cooper's battery. General Reynolds arrived at this moment and directed me to fall back into a road and place the men behind a hedge, which was done. Lieutenant-Colonel McIntire reported to me that his skirmishers engaged the enemy, discharged seven or eight volleys upon them, then fell back upon the rifle-pits, and there fired upon them again, and then joined the regiment in good order. While remaining in the road, posted as I have stated, under a continuous fire of shell, the officers and men of the regiment behaved with a marked intrepidity and coolness. Between 4 and 5 o'clock I was ordered by General Reynolds to advance up the road toward Mechanicsville and form upon the right in rear of a woods, supporting Cooper's battery. After advancing through the woods I took position upon the crest of a hill to the right of some rifle-pits and a battery, and in front of where another was soon after planted. The regiment had scarcely gained this position when the enemy, concealed in the woods below, opened upon me a galling fire of musketry, which was particularly severe upon the right of the line. This fire was returned by the regiment promptly and most effectively, and in less than an hour we had driven them from the woods and silenced their musketry. Occasional shots were, however, heard, though no injury was done by hem. About 5 o'clock on the morning of the 27th we left the field under orders. I regret to append a list of the killed and wounded, and as a passing tribute to those who fell can only say that they were among the bravest and best that we had. My thanks are due to the officers and men of the regiment for united good conduct and intrepid valor, and more especially to Lieutenant colonel H. M. McIntire, Major Lemuel Todd, and Adjt. W. W. Stewart, for the prompt, self-sacrificing, and energetic manner with which they carried out the orders given them.

The following is a list of the losses in the regiment: Aggregate - Killed, 7; wounded, 20; missing, 6. I take occasion again to express my acknowledgments to both officers and men for gallantry and good conduct during the action of the 27th ultimo, in which the losses were as follows.*
