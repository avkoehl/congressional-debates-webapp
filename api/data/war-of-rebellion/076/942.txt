(Received 10.25 a. m.)

General WHEELER, Commanding, &amp;c.:

The general wants more specific information touching the position and strength of the enemy's left. Have sent the same information to General Martin.

[F. A. SHOUP,

Chief of Staff.]

AUGUST 3, 1864-9.45 a. m.

(Received 11.14 a. m.)

General MARTIN, Commanding, &c.:

General Hood is in want of definite information of the enemy's left. He wants to know not only where it is, but what forces are there. Use every means in your power to ascertain.

[F. A. SHOUP,

Chief of Staff.]

ATLANTA, August 3, 1864-8.30 p. m.

Brigadier General DANIEL W. ADAMS, Opelika:

Roddey's command will return to you to-morrow.

[J. B. HOOD,

General.]

MACON, August 3, 1864.

Colonel JOHN B. SALE:

General Hood's command should include the whole State of Georgia, west of a line due south from Augusta. Confusion and conflicts now exist here, at his main depots, and at other points where he has stores and hospitals, and he is powerless to correct them. Great irregularities, drunkenness, and consequent demoralization, are too apparent at this place. I am detained by the condition of the railroad east. It will take several days yet for the track and four weeks for the Oconee bridge.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

[Indorsements.]

Submitted to the President.

SECRETARY OF WAR:

A modification of limits is no doubt desirable, but I doubt the advisability of the one proposed. Please consider, inquire, and confer.
