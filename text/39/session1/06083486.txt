THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 29,
used more for the public advantage than by
appropriating them for such works of internal
improvement, for then they are made useful
and of advantage to all the people.
I think this is an apprehension in which the
. Senator from Michigan indulges without any
foundation, and I will invite his attention to
the old law under which the existing company
was organized, in which the same phraseology
is employed as is employed in this bill; In the
"act to facilitate communication between the
Atlantic and Pacific States by electric tele-
graph" the phraseology is this:
"And permission is hereby granted to said parties
to whom said contract may be awarded, or a major-
ity of them, and theil' a«S'srns, to use until the end
of said tenia, such unoccupied public lauds of the
United Suites as may bo necessary for the right of
way and for the purpose of establishing stations for
repairs along said line, not exceeding at any station
one quarter section of land, such stations not to ex-
ceed one in fifteen miles on an average of the whole
distance, unless said lands shall be required by the
Government of the United States for railroad or other
purposes."
Mr. HOWARD. But here the stations may
be adjacent to each other. The old act requires
the stations to be not nearer than fifteen miles.
Mr. SHERMAN. I ask the Senator if he
thinks they would establish a station in the
wilderness in order to get a quarter section of
wild land ?
Mr. HOWARD. Certainly I do. Let one
of these companies go into the wilderness and
preempt and squat upon every lot of one hun-
dred and sixty acres upon a particular line—
the one hundred and sixty acres are worth
$200 at the minimum price—and it would be
a very great speculation.
Mr. SHERMAN. They would make a station
there to do that ?
Mr. HOW ARD. Certainly they would make
a station there for that purpose. There is no
difficulty about it. It makes a settlement upon
the lot. brings it into market, changes owner-
ship from the United States to the occupant,
and thus the public land will go.
Mr. WILLIAMS. 1 think that if it was
true that this telegraph company would do all
that the Senator from Michigan apprehends, it
would be an advantage to the country. If this
telegraph company can cause a settlement
across this continent upon the public domain
as frequently as he supposes, it will be an ad-
vantage to the country, it will enhance the
value of the public domain that may not be
taken by the company, and it will extend the
population of the United States across the con-
tinent and conduce to the settlement of the
public lands.
Mr. HOWARD. Perhaps it would, but sup-
pose the telegraph company should abandon
i*"S line after it, had acquired the title and go
off, no reversion to the United States would
follow.
Mr. WILLIAMS. The honorable Senator
can indulge in all possible suppositions. I
doubt whether any project for any public en-
terprise can be submitted to the Senate about
which Seuators may not indulge in improbable
suppositions. But is it probable that when a
company has invested millions of dollars in a
telegraph line across the continent that is pay-
ing a large interest upon the money invested,
it will abandon that line?
Mr. HENDRICKS. I will ask the Senator
this question : when the right of preemption is
secured, the purchase made, and the patent
given to the company, what is to prevent the
company withdrawing its station from that land
to another station, at its pleasure, and going
on with one preemption after preemption, ac-
cording to its own pleasure, under the language
of this bill?
Mr. SHERMAN. I supposed my friend from
Michigan was merely joking on this point; but
if the Senator from indiana is serious, if he
really chinks there ought to be a limitation on
it, I should say one station to every fifteen or
twenty miles. •
Mr. WILLIAMS. I have not charge of this
bill, and it is not my business to defend its
particular phraseology, and I did not take the
floor for that purpose: I intended simply to
express-my hope that this bill—or if this bill
is not satisfactory in its phraseology to Sena-
tors, I hope the gentleman having it in charge
will make it conform to their wishes so long as
the end in view is preserved—I simpjy intended
to advocate the passage of this bill or some
su£h bill for the purpose of putting down the
present monopoly.
Mr. HOWARD. I will help you to do that.
Mr. WILLIAMS. As I find that my remarks
are extendingfurtlierthan I originally intended,
and leading to protracted discussion, on. account
of the lateness of the hour I will not trouble
the Senate further.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. Mr. President 
Mr. GRIMES. Let us vote on my amend-
ment, and then discuss the general merits of
the bill.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. T understand the amend-
ment of the Senator from Iowa to be to change
the whole character of the bill. The bill as it
stands is granting rights to a particular com-
pany ; but the bill as it will stand after that
amendment is adopted is to grant the same
privileges to all companies that now exist or
hereafter may exist under the laws of any State,
not confining its operation to any one company.
I rose not so much to discuss the bill as to
refer to the statute under which the existing
company received what rights it received from
the General Government; and I think that
when it is spoken of as a monopoly which has
been granted by the Government the character
of that measure is not properly understood.
The truth is, that in 18G0, before we had any
such communication as telegraphs across the
continent, and when by the great mass of the
people it was regarded as almost a Utopian
scheme to propose to build a telegraph to the
Pacific, Congress passed a law by which it let to
the lowest bidder the right to build a telegraph
line from Missouri across to San Francisco.
The bids were 'to be advertised for, I think,
sixty days, and as an inducement to enable
some person or company to go into the con-
struction of this telegraph line Congress agreed
in behalf of the Government that it would use
the line across the continent and pay for the
useof it $40,000 peryear. They further agreed
that if the company did more than $40,000
worth of telegraphing for the Government at
the ordinary price for which telegraphing was
done for individuals, they would pay the excess
over the $40,000. Congress agreed that the
Government business should amount to the
sum of 840,000 a year to the contractors. The
fact is, that the business of the Government has
much exceeded, I suppose, the $40,000 every
year since the telegraph line was completed.
In 1844 the first, telegraph line was estab-
lished in this country, from Washington to
Baltimore, and the first message which passed
over the line, as I recollect, was the message
of the Baltimore convention announcing the
nomination of the candidate for the Presi-
dency, who was elected that year. From 1844
down to about 1850 there were various com-
peting lines of telegraph built up all over the
United States, and as a general thing they
were failures upon the hands of those who
were operating them. Although they were a
great convenience to the country the men who
put their money into them and engaged in
building them failed. O'Reilly had his great
telegraph line; other persons had their tele-
graph lines; but from -1854 to 1850 the gentle-
men who were interested in the lines came to
an arrangement by which the lines were con-
solidated more or less throughout the country;
and in 1860, after the lines had become consoli-
dated, this act was passed by Congress letting
out this matter of telegraphing across the con-
tinent to the lowest bidder, and the contract
was taken in behalf of this consolidated tele-
graph company, and the line was built. The
line became a magnificent success, and the re-
sult was that this telegraph stock or telegraph
property sprung like a new creation out of
nothing, and has advanced itself, I suppose, to
be worth thirty or forty or fifty million dollars.
It is a new creation of wealth growing out of
this new discovery. But, sir, when you look
into the statute of 1860 it really does not con-
fer any monopoly upon that company.
Mr. SHERMAN. One section of that bill
expressly authorized Congress to extend the
same rights to other companies.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. The act provides that
the Government will, for a given length of
time, employ this telegraph to the amount of
$40,000 a year at least. The Government
guaranty to do at least as much business a3
that with the company, and so far the guaran- %
tee has been kept. We also agreed that the
company, in building its line, might preempt
at each station a quarter section of land, but
those stations were not to be within fifteen
miles of each other. That was the provision
of the statute. The contract was to be for the
period of ten years and to be awarded to the
lowest responsible bidder. That was in the
year 1860. The act declared further:
" Provided, That no such contract shall be made
until the said line shall be in actual operation, and
payments thereunder shall cease whenever the con-
tractors fail to comply with their contracts; that the
Government shall at all times be entitled to priority
in the useof tbelineor lines, and shall have the priv-
ilege, when authorized by law, of connecting said lino
or lines by telegraph with any military posts of the
United States and to use the same for Government
purposes: And provided also, That said line or lines,
except such as may be constructed by the Government
to connect said line or lines with the military posts
of the United States, shall be open to the use of all
citizens of the United States during the term of tho
said contract, «n payment of the regular charges for
transmission of dispatches: Andvrovided also. That
such charges shall not exceed three dollars for a single
dispatch of ten words, with the usual proportionate
deductions upon dispatches of greater length: Pro-
vided, That nothing herein contained shall confer
upon the said parties any exclusive right to construct
a telegraph to the Pacific, or debar the Government
of the United States fromgranting, from time to time,
similar franchises and privileges to other parties."
Mr. BROWN. Do T understand that to be
a limitation of three dollars for ten words on
messages across the continent?
Mr. DOOLITTLE. It was from the west
line of the State of Missouri to San Francisco.
What I insist is that the company must act in
good faith.
Mr. BROWN. It is clear from the reading
of that provision that they have violated their
charter.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. In relation to what the
facts are I will not undertake to state ; but I
say that it would be held in any court if any
proceeding were taken against tlieni for dam-
ages, or any proceeding against them by way
of injunction or for forfeiture, that they could
be compelled to carry out this law in good
faith, so that the price of dispatches should not
exceed the sum which is here mentioned in
the statute.
Mr. STEWART. But the Senator will ob-
serve that there is a very small portion of the
people of the United States who reside west
of the Missouri river. The. great mass of the
people reside east of that; and the same com-
bination owns the lines east. The people east
have to get their messages to that point and
must pay for getting them there.
. Mr. DOOLITTLE. That may be all true ;
but here is the real fact: we in 1860 let to the
lowest bidder the business of building a tele-
graph line across the continent; and the ques-
tion is, as that contract only runs for the ten
years, shall we now, is it good policy, is it
wise, is it just to provide for building on the
same line another telegraph? Although the
power is reserved to us to do it, ought we to
exercise that power, is the question. That is
a question which addresses itself to the good
faith of Congress. The fact that this company
took upon itself the risk when it was supposed
to be a risk, when many believed it was a chi-
mera to suppose that a line could be built and
kept up across the continent, ought to weigh
something with us. My judgment is that if
this company has exceeded in its charges what
it has a right to charge for its dispatches, there
should be a proceeding against it. It would
work a forfeiture.
Mr. WILLIAMS. Allow me to suggest that
