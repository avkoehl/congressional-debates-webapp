Numbers 111. Report of Brigadier General William W. Burns, U. S. Army, commanding First Division.
HEADQUARTERS BURNS' DIVISION,Opposite Fredericksburg, Va., December 17, 1862

I have the honor to report the operations of my division on December 12, 13, 14, and 15.

On the evening of the 11th, the Forty-sixth New York, Lieutenant-Colonel Gerhardt, crossed Bridge Numbers 3. as fast as the plans were laid down, and remained on picket duty in Fredericksburg during the night. I crossed the same bridge with the division about 9 o'clock on the 12th.

On the morning of the 13th, I was directed to move my division across Hazel Run, and connect my left with General Franklin's right, at Deep Run, and hold myself subject to the orders of General Franklin if called upon.

About 3 o'clock, I received an order from General Franklin to cross Deep Run and cover his bridges. I reported to General Franklin by authority of General Willcox, and remained during the night.

I received an order from General Franklin, on the morning of the 14th, to recross Deep Run and report to General Willcox, who directed me to form my division on the left bank of Hazel Run, preparatory to moving on the enemy at 10 o'clock.

I recrossed the Rappahannock on the 15th.

I inclose herewith a list of killed and wounded.#

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. W. BURNS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Captain ROBERT A. HUTCHINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
