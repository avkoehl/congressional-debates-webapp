Dear Sik : I would have returned the bond sooner,
but the citizens of Columbus, confident of tho inno-
cence of the parties in confinement of any oflense
against either the civil or military authorities, insist
on going on the bond, as an assurance to the parties
arrested that they have the entire confidence of their
follow citizens, and are above any well-founded sus-
picion of criminal conduct. It is with difficulty that
I am enabled to clote the signatures, even at this
P°Witli thanks for your courtesy in my intercourse
with you in this unpleasant business. I remain , your
obedient servant, R« J« MUbF.b.
