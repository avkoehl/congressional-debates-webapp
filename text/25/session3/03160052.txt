APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[January 3,
25th Cong....3d Sess.
Graduation Bill—Mr. Benton.
Senate.
Thin table exhibits the detail and the gro^s of the
amounts which would have been taken from the I
Treasury in eighteen months, if the land bill of ■
3836 had passed, with the detail and the gross also '
of what was actually requned for the serviceof the
Government for the same time They amount,
m round numbers, to $55,000,000 for distribution,
and $55 000,000 for the support of Government,
mall $110,000,000' Now, sir, how was the Treas-
ury to stand this enormous call' It could not have
stood it all' It could not havestood the first pull,
the iirst seventeen and a quarter millions for dis-
tribution, and seven and three quarters for the pub-
lic service, which would have been required on
the 1st day of July, 1836. It would have failed
at that payment, and so I declared, and in my own
opinion, demonstrated at that time, and so the
event proved, when the deposit act passed, and
substituted a smaller and laterdistnbution. This
deposit act passed in June of 1836, it began to take
effect in January, 1837, it proposed to divide out
but $36,000,000, and that by $!),000,000atatime,
and to commence the distribution six months later
than the land bill proposed, and yet what was the
result' The i esult was the stoppage of the prm
cipal deposit banks, and all the rest of the banks
withm five months after the distribution began to
take effect' The deposit bank? made the first dis-
tribution in January, they nearly sunk under the
second installment in April; they were unable to
meet the third one m July, and closed their doors '
jn May; and, while several causes contributed to '
the result, yet it must never be forgotten that the
committee of the New York banks, where the |
stoppage began, in enumerating the four principal |
causes for that event, placed at the head of those i
causes, the operation of the ¡deposit or oistribu- j
Tiou act of Jane, 1836 ? Thus experience proved
that the deposit banks could not stand a distribu-
tion ofthirty-six millions, commencing six months
later than the proposed land bill distribution, and
tnadem quarterly installments of only nine millions
at a time. How, then, could they have stood a
distribution of fifty five millions, commencing six
wombs earlier, and the first installment amounting
to seventeen and a quarter millions' The thing
was impossible, itcould not bedone, and that was
eo evident to me that t proclaimed it, and reiterated
my opinion on this floor in language too strong,
m the judgment of some of my friends, to be al-
lowed to go to the country, and what was that
opinion bottomed upon ' Upon the fact known to
us all, and by me repeated a thousand times, that
what was called a surplus of forty millions in the
Treasury, was a mere DFUibioN, that the money,
in point of fact, was not in the deposit banks,
that it had been ient out, that Congress had
sanctioned and instigated theunroiKe, by requir
ing interest from the banks for its use, that, in-
stead of being in the banks it was in the hands of
merchants, traders, dealers, manufacturers, me-
chanics, speculators, and otheis, that the banks
had tjsfd it with the knowledge of Congress, and
with the implied contract and fair understanding
of having the use of it till gradually called for on
account of the public service, and that to call for
all this money in masses, and almost without no-
tice (for the first payment would have begun as
soon as the oil! could have  been passed) was to
COMFEt IHt, LARGE DEPOSIT BASKS TO CIIOOSí BE-
TWEEN STOPFIKG PAYMENT THEMSELVES, OR DE-
STROYING their di etobs All this was so plain
to me that it was amazing, incomprehensible, and
almost incredible that any person could avoid see
mgthe same. Yet this is the measute, the loss of
which we are called upon to deplore ' This is the
measure, the patriotic resistance of which, by
Geneial Jackson, is denounced asan act of tyran-
ny ' This is the measure, then believed to be irre-
sistibly popu'ai, now known tobe heartily con-
demned by every considerate man   This is the
measure before which General Jackson, and all us
opponent"! were expected to be prostiated; (and
before which they weie willing to have been pros-
trated if such had been the penalty of adherence
to their principles,) this is the measure which, like
the consular distributions oí gram, and money,
and public lands, among the voters in the degen
eratedays of the Roman Republic, was expected
to purchase the suffiages of all the people' Gen-
eral Jackson and his friends, myself one of them,
did what they believed was right m resisting this
measure, without regard to consequences personal
to themselves They resisted the colossal distri-
bution of fifty-five millions of money They threw
themselves upon the intelligence, the patriotism,
and the candor of their fellow-countrymen; and
the event has proved that they were not mistaken
in their estimate of that candor, that intelligence,
and that patriotism ' Ithasproved that the Ameri-
can people are not yet ready to be seduced and
debauched with the spoils and pillage of their own
country
Sir, (said Mr. B.,) I pursue this bill of May,
1836, one step further; I puisue it into the fourth
section, and see that nothing but a war with a
foreign power could have arrested the distribu-
tion of the $55,000,000, and given the Treasury a
right to retain the $24,877,179 received from the
public lands in 1836, and the 6,776,^36 received
from them in 1837 By the terms of the act, the
distribution was to go on without regard to any-
thing but a foreign war, and the $32,000,000 re-
ceived from the lands in 1836 and '37 were to be-
long to the States, and to be paid to them, without
the least regard to the condition of the public Treas-
ury It was a specific appropriation of the pro-
ceeds of the lands, and as suoh would have been
paid over to the States on the days named in the
act. The " skutlmg up " of the Treasury would
have made no difleience, the stoppage of the banks
would have made no difference, there was no for-
eign war—the appropriation was specificand abso-
lute—and the delivery of the money to the States
would have been compulsory and inevitable What
then! Why, that notwithstanding the retroactive
disbursements from the Treasury of the before re-
ceived revenues from the lands of 1833,-'34, and
'35—notwithstanding the attempt to disburse these
old expended revenues might have bankrupted the
deposit banks—yet the current receipts from the
landsfor 1836and '37 would have been turned over
to the States as they came in ' The |25,000,000
(nearly) of 1836 would have gone totheStates, the
|7,000,000 (neaily) of 1&37 would have gone to
them also' and thus, with the banks all stopped,
with the Treasury shut up, with Congress called
together to provide the ways and means of keep-
ing the Government in motion, with the duties
from customs sinking down to nothing, merchants'
duty-bonds postponed, balances from banks de-
layed for many months, with all this we should
have been paying out to the States the $7,000,000
of hard money received fiom the lands m 1837,
and which $7,000,000 m specie was the sheet an-
chor of the Government m that disastrous year,
and the only thing which saved it from the degrada-
tion and rum of using depreciated paper money
and shm plasters'
Mr President, we hear much of the incapacity,
the ignorance, the incompetency, and the reck-
lessness of the Jackson administration, we hear
much of all this from the Opposition, without
their being able to specify a measure to which
these epithets will apply, but here is an act of the
Opposition itself, whtch places the leaders in a
position to choose between a confession of abso-
lute incapacity to manage the public affairs, or of
a deliberate design to bankrupt the Treasury and
the banks No, Mr President, the Jackson Ad-
ministration was not ignorant, was not reckless,
was not incompetent, and to hurl such epithets at
that Administration, is to hurl them at the people,
by whom that Administration was created and has
been sustained. To attack that Administration,
appioved as it was in the triumphant second elec-
tion of General Jackson, and in the triumphant
election of Ins successor, is to attack the capaci-
ty of the people foi self-government' It is to at-
tack the elective principle of our Constitution, and
to say that that principle ought to be abolished,
and an hereditary ruler given as a guardian to
those who were so incompetent to choose their
own Chief Magistrate No, sn ' Great are the
services which General Jackson has rendered to
his countiy—great in the field—stillgreater in the
Cabinet His civil administration was a contin-
ued series of patriotic exertions, the emanation
no less of a heroic soul, than of a sagacious head,
and a patriot heart None but a hero could have
acted the part, m civil affairs, which he did
Above all men who have lived in our eventful
times, a smgle individual, perhaps, alone ex-
cepted, he will be stamped the hero-states,nr>an oí
the age. 1 have heietofore endeavored to do some
justice to his various, transcendent, and vietonous
policy. I have endeavored to present some views
of his numerous, brilliant, and successful amelio-
rations at home, and negotiations abroad 1 have
endeavored to piesent him as postenty will view
him, covered, illustrated, niadiated with every
species of glory, and above all with the eloiy of
usefulness—with the gloiyof having mproved
the condition, bettered the circumMances, au-
vanced the fortune, and personally benefited
eveiy industrious inhabitant which the country
contains. I have endeavored to do this, and I
appeal to the piesent unparalleled, unrivaled, un-
precedented, unexampled, universal, pervading,
and exulting prospenty of the cuuntiy for the
truth and fidelity of the pictures which I have
endeavored to draw.
It is not my intention to repeat, on the present
occasion, what 1 have heretofore delivered on tina
subject, but there is one point which,though here-
tofore mentioned, has never been presented with
the fulness, individuality, and development which
its impoitance and magnitude deserves. I allude
to our cotton production and its influence upon
the wealth and industry of ev<>ry poition of this
extended Union, and the part which General Jack-
son has acted in bunging that production to what
it now is, and to what it must be. What was the
extent of our cotton growing territory before the
victorious arms ot General Jackson acquired for
us the vast region of the South and Southwest'
It was a part of South Carolina, a part of Geor-
gia, some slips in North Carolina, Tennessee,
Mississippi, and Louisiana. What is it now' It
is all Florida, all Georgia, all Alabama,all Missis-
| sippi, ail Louisrana, all Arkansas, South Caí olma,,
apart of North Carolina, a third of Tennessee,
and a slip in Missouri. In territorial extent our
I cotton giowing region has been increased more
than tenfold by the victorious arms of Genera!
, Jackson over the southern Indians, and by his
I still more victorious policy over the political allies
of those Indians, their federal allies, whose struggle
it was to letam them in the southern States to
dimmish their political importance and to cripple
their advance. What was the value of our cotton
export before these great operations of Genera!
1 Jackson began ' It was $,14,000 000. What is i:
now' It is $ 80,000,000 And what is its capacity
of augmentation ' Almost limitless and boundless,
or only limited by the wants of Europe, Asia,
Africa, and the two Americas; for to all these
countries, even to the Ganges and the Black Sea,
to the Cape of Good Hope, and to Terra del Fu-
ego do our American cottons now go. And what
is the influence ot this vast pioduction, so amaz-
ingly augmented under the vietonous arms, and
I still more victorious policy, of one man—what is
J its influence upon the mdustiy, the pursuits, and
I the wealth of every part of this extended Confed-
eracy' To answer this question, let the mind's eye
figure to itself a map of this Union, and then con-
template every species of industry which is carried
I on upon the vast diversified domain which it rep-
resents Let him look at our shipping mteresS
fiom the Chesapeake to Passamaquoddy bay, al'
finding its greatest and richest employment in
carrying our cotton abroad, and bringing back
the productions of so many nations received in
exchange for it. Let him see our most opulent
merchants, throughout the whole extent of our
coast, from New Orleans to New York, all bot-
toming their laigest operations upon the cotton of
the South. Look to the manufacturing industry
| of the whole northeast, of which Massachusetts
may be taken as an example, and as the highest
pattern, manufactures of leathei, cotton, wool,
iron, brass, tin, wood,glass, stone, &c , the grand
aggregate of which, in all the northeast, may be
judged of from the annual product of near ninety
millions of dollars for Massachusetts alone, and a
goodly proportion of the whole of which finds its
market in the same cotton-growing region Cross-
ing the Alleghany mountains, and descending
upon the western waters, see twelve millions of
manufactured articles, the product of the industry
I of three or four miles square at the confluence of
the Alleghany and Monong&hela, see these twelve
