ninth Michigan and One hundred and fifteenth Ohio, 200 men of the latter being prisoners. In addition to Miller's brigade, the One hundred and seventy-third Ohio, Fourth Division, Twentieth Corps, is here doing post duty, but General Miller says, he cannot spare it, and that he has your letter assuring him the garrison shall not be diminished. With that regiment and the Forty-third Wisconsin, now at Clarksville by order of the major-general commanding, I could garrison the Chattanooga road. I have heard from General Watkins, at Hadensville, and suppose General McCook will be able to attend to Lyon in Kentucky.

Major General L. H. ROUSSEAU,

Nashville, Tenn.:

The Forty-fifth, Forty-eighth, and Forty-ninth Missouri Regiments are ordered to report to you. They had better be sent down this road, one to go to Spring Hill and keep the advanced depot. The Forty-third Wisconsin, at Clarksville, is available; also a regiment at Fort Donelson, which was stopped there on its way up the Cumberland-I do not remember the number; this is now available to you. Send the Forty-eighth and Forty-ninth Missouri to this place. The One hundred and eighty-second Ohio can be used to guard the Nashville and Chattanooga road. There are also the Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth Wisconsin, now at Nashville for the purpose of being organized; when organized, they will be available for railroad duty.
