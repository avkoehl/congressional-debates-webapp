Making public officei s depositories—Mr. Strange.
Senate
may be offered for the iiiiuie of the banks, they
have failed, signally failed, and if, as has "been
strongly remarked by the Senator from South Caro
lina, it be folly  to tiy untried experiments, it is
madness to repeat those which have alreadj failed
But if we shut our eyes to experience, we mu'-l
be deaf also to the lessons of sound theory, if we
adopt the system proposed by the Senator from
Virginia Not only have the tanks failed, but the
principle of fauure is incorporated in their very
natures The system of banking, as practised
in this country never can be safe until it is radi-
cally altered The best of them issue *r>m two
and a half to three papT dolíais for one of specie,
and some have even gone as high as. seven , and as
long as-the phj3ical laws of nature continue to act,
it is manifest that the banks must uepend upon the
■whim, the caprice, the hopes, the fear>, the clemen-
cy, if you will, of their bill holders, for then exis-
tence And can that depository be deem°d safe
which carries withinit such elements of self-destruc-
tion'' But let us look a little faither The banks
will not take your deposites upon any othei condi-
tion than that of piedicaung upon them a circula-
tion of their notes How then does the case stand1
They take your -deposites, and promise you to re-
tura them whensoever demanded , but at the v ery
same moment they issue notes to twice or thrice
the amottntof their promise to you, bv which they
engage to pay to A, B and C the identical sum
they have promised to repay to you And dots
not every one see the utter impossibility of their
meeting three or four different engagements to pay
the same ideitical monej t What then are they
doing but miming the gambling a-,1 that they «ill
be called upon for but one of trie«e sums at a time'
But we are told, when they issued their notes to A,
B and C, they took m exchange A, B and C's notes,
well seemed for a like sum Giant it to be s0,
and that A B and C's notes are certainly ultimate
]y good, is it not manifest that A, B and C's notes
are on time, and are not immediately convertible,
and m fact that they would not be given but on
time, while the notes of the bank aie payable the
moment they are issued, and all three sets might
be immediately demanded And why should they
nol be"! The gambling hazard is taken that they
will not But furthermore, is it not perceptible
that this increase oí the circulating medium must
greatly increase the nominal value of property,
and that propeitv holders Mill thereby acquire a
false reputation toi wealth, which, acting upon
themselves and others, must lead them ¿uto specu-
lations which, upon any sudden denouement of af-
fairs, bringing propeity to the specie standard of
value, (and even below it, from the sudden pan c
produced,-  will leave the banks not only unable to
meet promptly the demands of the depositor, but
even, after a great lapse of time, able only but par-
tially to return the principal sum1
The banks have not only failed, then, but from
their very nature are pione to failure, and a still
further objection to the plan proposed, is drawn out
of the natural liability of all the banks in the
country to be operated upon by any cause mjuii-
ously affecting one So that however scatteied
your treasure may be, the same fell swoop which
robs you of it m New York, does the same lor you
in New Orleans—the same reversed alchemy which
converts jour gold and silver to inconvenible and
worthless paper m the one city docs so at neirly
the same mom nt m the other Your loss is not
partial, but comes upon you in one sw eeping deso-
lation
Again if the misfortunes before referred to were
most likelj to happen at those times when the Go-
vernment could best beir disappointment, it might
be ¡ess imprudent to encounter thehazaid But the
reverse precisely is the ca-e It is in tim<-s of diffi-
culty and public disties% vihen the means 01 re-
plenishing ftom othe' someta the failing supply of
the revenue "re cut off, that the banks will
be most likely to disappoint jou in their
engagements A wn, foi mstmce, is forc-
S'sn, and the Government his been hoarding
its rev etme to meet the exigencj Ii has laid
up its millions in the deposite bail s, mil is
only «siting until they have accumulated suffi-
ciently to proclaim defiance, and ch^fise the insult-
éis oí the national flag it is done The cost has
been counted, and it ha¡> been found that we have
money enough and to spare for the projected enter-
prise The star spangled banner is given to *he
breeze, and the heart of every Amen< an is bound-
ing with the pride of country But, alas' the trea-
sure upon which we hid counted is deposited in the
banks, and th^y have discounted freely upon it
War and commerce cannot go togelhe , and com-
mence is the sole stay of infilled credit Bill-hold-
ers become alirmed and each one rus íes m
w th breathless haste, fearful ot be ng the list to
piesent his chim The bailts in then best condi-
tion, can do no more than pay about forty percent
upon their circilation, and their specie, of eouise,
must be i immediately swept, or they must tal e a de-
termined stind, and refuse pavment In this stste
of things, the Government draws upon the banks
for sottif large sum to pav for the outfit of her
army and her navy The banks offers it m paper,
but this will not answer, and they have nothing else
that they are both able and willing to give you I
leave imagination to finish the picture
The banking system, as practised in dais country,
is, in my judgment, one vast bubble, and it is not
improbable that those now 1 vmg will witness its
bursting, and when the explosion has taken place,
as without reform at no very distant day it mu-t,
the men who succeed us will look back upon our
piesent infatuation with as much amazement as we
do upon that of the adventurers in the South Sea
scheme
But I object farther to the p'an proposed, on ac-
count of its tendency to place the Government in the
power of a party You have seen the natural effect
of a foreign wai upon commerce and the banks
Is it to be expected then that accmmercial commu-
nity could be calculated on as friendly to a war even
when necessary and just? I am the son of a mer-
chant, and it cannot therefore be supposed that I
would willingly cast reproach on the tomb of my
father I should be iccreant to all the best feelings
of the human beartweiel to denj to the merchants,
that intelligent and worthy class of citizens, all the
commendation they may so justly < laim Among
them still live some of the best and dearest of my
friends, but still they are frail humanity, and who
is there that can wish his interest and his duty to
be brought in collision? It is in mercant le com-
munities chiefly, if not altogether, thit banks are
to be found, and m these, und^r the deposite bank
system, your treasure must be placed \ war is
thought necessary, but the interests of a mercantile
community are opposed to it, and how eisily
therefore would they persuade themselves as many
of them did m the glorious strife of 1812-15, that
it was unnecessary, unnatural, and unjust, and
how naturally would they unite themselves with
that opposition whtch is never inconsiderable in
any free country1 Money is the smews of war,
and with how little trouble might an opposition cut
those sinews at the very moment you were aboot
to make use of them by causing the depos te banks
to suspend their payments1 And, ere a sense of
their countiy's honor, and the danger of their fel-
low citizens could tuumph over their calculations
of interest and awaken that patriotism which was
overlaid but not extinguished, the nations flag
might be dishonored, and her enfeebled army cut to
pieces
But a yet Mrongpi objection than all tint have
preceded it, and that, indeed, upon which they
mainly depend, is the difficulty of compelling these
corporations to perform their rnsagements, should
they choose to neglect, or find it inconvenient to
meet them He who expects them punctually to
meet then engagements, might as soon look for
the nin to descend upon h s thirstj fields at his
bidding The absolute control oí w ealth is essen-
tial to its enjojment eithei for a Government or
in individual That mm is poor, and poor as
winter who calls countless millions his, which are
vet beyond h s reach, while hunger and thirst pmeh
him, and the inclement seasons beat upon his de-
fenceless body No man m his senses would w il-
lmgly place himself m this situat on, but jef it is
precisely the predicament in which the Government
is asked to place itself What means have you to
compel an unwilling corporation to surrendei up
its hoard1   Do not reason  and experience unite
in   teaching   us   that, as corporations   are   con-
stituted   and   treated   in  this country, sums de-
posited with them, are placed measurably, if not
absolutely, beyond the contiol ol  the proprietor?
Look to tne TJmt"d States Bank, the creature of your
own hands, and therefore, as was once vainly ima-
gined,  subject  to   your own  control      But you
fodnd yourself in your attempt to control it in the
situation of the hero of one of Godwin's novels,
(faulkenstien, if I mi take not in the name,) who,
having acquired some magic power, cieated a mon-
ster, and infused into him the  Prometncan spark.
He doubted not that the same hand which  had
created could control      But  that position is true
m reference to one Powei onlv      The monster of
Faulkenstien turned Upon  its creator, and compel-
led him to fly 'or his life      In like mannerdid the
creature of your hands defy vour power, and con-
tinues to defy it, holding on with the grasp of death
to the treasure jeu have vaiii y striven to wring
from it    With how much better reasm then can
vou calculate on effectual control ovei lesser mon-
sters wnich j ou did not create, and have no right
to destroy?   The truth is, they have alreadv defied
vou, and you find yoursilf powerless before them.
They havt defied the true majesty of the country,
its whole people     And have you stiH the vanity
to suppose that, it ith powers so properly restrained
and circumscribed as jours, with strength, gigantic
as it may be,  bound and shackled in the massy
fetters of the Constitution, you can b°nd to sub-
mission that which has defied the untrammelled
might of the bodv from whom jou derive the whole
of your strength1   But grant to yourself, if you
pleas , pow er as extensive as you can well imagine,
the law s of nature  must be yet stronger than you,
and these the banks, as constituted w ill alw ays be
enabled to bring m conflict with you, naj', even to
induce vour own masters—those m whose breath
you live, and move, and have your being, to array
themselves against ton foi that brief and critical
moment which embraces the mam issue of such a
snuggle      For  example    by extensive discounts
and emissions of its paper, a bank may create such
a demand upon its specie funds as to sweep them
in a moment beyond your reach, and thus anticipate
any process of seizure you could possibly devise,
and leave nothing for you to reach but irredeema-
ble paper    Nay, even with issues at the most pru-
dent rate, it might find iU interest m the expendi-
ture of its whoie specie in  the purchase of stocks,
or othf-r paper, not immediately convertible, and
with the innumerable agents it could command, in,
the most secret manner convey it away while you
were demanding payment, and thus foil you by
that   inflexible    law   that impassibilities can  be
wiought by no man, that payment cannot be forced
from him vv ho his parted with the means of pay-
men*   Butgrant that the specie remains mthebankas-
now, and its managers should deem itmexpedient,as
now, to use it in the fulfilment of its engagements,
by the use  of  no other art than that already
so successfullj practised, bj   mtei weaving with its
own the pecuniary interests of the vicinity in which
it might happen to be placed, it could cause every
member of that community to spring forward as
one man in its defence, and manlv bosoms and
warm hearts excited and misled for the occasion,
would present a iving wall, over which you would
not pass, if j ou could, to get at the insolent corpo-
íation defying your just claims      Did you   not
hear the Senator from South Carolina over the way,
telling us a few davsago of the ramifications, not
of the branches only, but of the roots also, of these
institutions, penetrating as those of a tree do the
natural  soil the whole ground of individual inte-
rest, tearing and subverting it whersoever they are
ttuched1    What then must you expect when jou
shakt them for fruit, whethti full oi empty1 What
agitation   what commotion,  what confusion, will
iioA riake, when time shall hive given to these
roots a yet wider spread an 1 a firmer hold1 When
you hav e fixed chains upon the viewless winds,
and dragged them in tuumph it the wheels of jour
chariot, then miy jou find the powei of controlling-
corporations, after  you have trusted them, Without
violating and trampling undei foot principles held
sacred   in   tne hearts   of the   American  people.
