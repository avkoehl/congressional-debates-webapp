HEADQUARTERS SCOUTS ON LOWER AMITE RIVER,French Settlement, May 4, 1865.

Major EDWARD BYRNE,

Commanding Military Station, Gainnie's Landing:

MAJOR: In compliance with my promise to you on the occasion of our late interview, I reported as soon as practicable to Colonel Daniel Gober, commanding District of Southwest Mississippi and East Louisiana, and asked his permission to allow me to surrender my squad of scouts to you. I am authorized by the colonel to surrender as soon as Johnston's army surrenders; hence as soon as you are officially notified of said surrender you will oblige me by informing me of the same. It is understood that we will be received under the same conditions that were given to General Lee by General Grant. You will inform me if you agree to said conditions, in your answer. I am authorized to state to you that Captain Bradley, commanding a detached company of the Fifth Louisiana Cavalry Regiment, will report to you with the remnant of his men under the same conditions.

Respectfully,

F. P. POCHE,

Commanding Scouts, &amp;c.
