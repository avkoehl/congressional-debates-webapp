Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

Your dispatch of the 30th is received. I am in communication with General Hurlbut on the subject. General Davidson, with his cavalry division, is at Wittsburg, on the Saint Francis, ready to co-operate.

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, August 1, 1863.

Brigadier-General DAVIDSON,

Wittsburg, Ark.:

Your dispatches of the 28th and 29th are received. If Marmaduke is at or near Jacksonport, you should move against him at once. The movement you purpose via Clarendon will leave him free to make a raid into Missouri,which he will be sure to make. He could do us great damage, and then escape in spite of you. It will not do to leave him so far in your rear.

General Hurlbut has been ordered to organize and direct the expedition from Helena. He informs me that General Prentiss will go in command. The column will, I presume, move via Clarendon or Des Arc. You will report to General Prentiss or other officer in command,if he be your senior, and act under his orders, as soon as you shall have disposed of Marmaduke so as protect Missouri from a raid. This order is in pursuance of instruction from the General-in-Chief.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

General DAVIDSON, Wittsburg, Ark.:

I have ordered back from Cuba+ to Dalton+ and all the men belonging to your division, and will send them to Brussels.+
