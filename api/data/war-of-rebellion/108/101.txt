I have taken measures to keep myself informed, and would immediately have the Indians before me if I participated fully in the apprehensions of Mr. Starke and the Indians. I call your attention to the fact that the mails to this place are only tri-weekly through any communication may be made daily by the conductor of the cars.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICHMOND, May 22, 1861

Colonel R. S. GARNETT,

Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that there are 630 men from Maryland at and opposite Harper's Ferry (unarmed), 150 at and near the Point of Rocks (one company of sixty men armed) and possibly 200 here desiring to be mustered into service. Many of these men well drilled, about 300 of them being of the Fifty-third Regiment, Maryland Guard. There are in all about 2,800 reported to me, but only fourteen companies organized. I have been unwilling to bring more into Virginia until steps are taken to properly organize and arm them as they come. I respectfully request instructions on the subject.

Your obedient servant

FRAS. J. THOMAS.
