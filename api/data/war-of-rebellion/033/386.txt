HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE NORTHWEST,Milwaukee, Wis., July 21, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Washington:

GENERAL: The inclosed copy of a Saint Paul newspaper# contain a very full account of Sibley's expedition up to July 5. You will readily see how utterly mistaken those who put in circulation the accounts in the papers, which are, doubtless, repeated to you. I will endeavor to keep you advised of everything of importance in this department, and I think my opportunities for knowing the condition of affairs in this department are as good, if not better, than those of any one not connected with the military service. Representations and applications similar to those made in regard to the present expedition were made to me last autumn,and I was urged, with many authentic statements of facts, to remove Sibley from the command of the expedition last September, only a few weeks before he brought it to a most successful termination. As I declined to accede to such applications, it is likely they have been transferred to you, but I think you will save yourself much trouble and annoyance by referring them again to me. I have every hope that the combined movements of Sully and Sibley will put a decisive end to Indian hostilities in the Northwest. Of course small parties of hostile Indians will endeavor to harass the border settlements, in the hope to arrest Sibley's march. This was to be expected, and a large force and every precaution has been devoted to preventing any considerable trouble. There are not troops enough in our whole armies to satisfy the people of Minnesota, and place a regiment or company in the front door of every settler's house in the country. A few Indians, never more than three or four together, have been lurking about on the frontier, far in the rear of Sibley, but they ought easily to be dealt with by the people alone, without the aide of soldiers. Nevertheless, a very large force of troops is posted along the entire frontier settlements, and is constantly patrolling the line of frontier. This horse-stealing, and occasional outrage by one or two Indians at a time, who steal into the settlements, all the troops in the world could not prevent. Every pre-
