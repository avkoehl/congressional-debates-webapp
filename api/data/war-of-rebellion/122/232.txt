MOUNTAIN CITY, COLO. TER., May 24, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: Here in these mountains we have hundreds anxious to contribute to the support of the Government and to assist in maintaining the integrity of the flag of our country. If we organize companies will the Government accept our services? If we had the assurance that the volunteers would be accepted there would be no lack of men inured to toil and hardships ready to enlist for the war.

Yours, respectfully,

HENRY M. TELLER.

This Department assigns the quota to be furnished by each State, and they will be furnished to it by the Governors.

Very respectfully,

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.
