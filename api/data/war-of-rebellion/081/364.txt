HEADQUARTERS SIEGE ARTILLERY,June 23, 1864-11.45 [a.m.]

Lieutenant GILLETT, Ordnance Officer, Siege Train:

Remain until the train arrives; it has been sent for, and will doubtless come to-day or to-night. When it comes apply to General Ingalls for transportation for four 30-pounder Parrotts and four 8-inch mortars, with 100 rounds each, and see that the train reports to Captain Brigham, at Spring Hill, without delay. Acknowledge receipt of this. Captain Pitkin at City Point, will probably be aware of the arrival of the train.

HENRY L. ABBOT.

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery.

CITY POINT, VA., June 23, 1864.

Colonel ABBOT, First Connecticut:

Four schooners have arrived. The others will be up during the night. Parrott guns are not here yet. I shall unload the mortars and send them on their way, and wait for the guns. Captain Hatfield wishes to know if the siege train shall go to Bermuda Landing or remain here. General Ingalls will afford every facility for a dock near Spring Hill if you wish it.

First Lieutenant, First Connecticut Artillery.

Ordnance Officer:

(Care of Captain Pitkin, City Point.)

Bring also 300 extra rounds of 30-pounder Parrott ammunition for Captain Burton's three guns. Explain it to Captain Brigham. Acknowledge receipt.

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery.

HEADQUARTERS TENTH CORPS.

June 23, 1864-8.42. a.m.

Colonel SHAFFER:

A different understanding should exist about Colonel Abbot's command. I should have command of all the troops within my entrenchments. Since 4 o'clock this morning there has been a vacancy in my line, caused by the withdrawal of a company by orders direct from department headquarters. Colonel Abbot's command should be entirely withdrawn or placed under my orders.

W. T. H. BROOKS,Brigadier-General.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS.

June 23, 1864.

General BROOKS:

Colonel Abbot went away by an order from General Grant last night to take charge of siege train. He will not return. More of his regiment
