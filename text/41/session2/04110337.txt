Vessels entered into or cleared from the United States from or to France are not included in this statement.
The inadequacy of our present tonnage for
the demands of our national intercourse with
those countries becomes still more apparent in

It is discouraging to see that of our trade
with those markets alone over four hundred
thousand tons are carried not by our own but
by foreign ships ; not even by the ships of those
countries, but by over a thousand crafts of mer-
cantile interlopers of northern Europe, who
support more than fourteen thousand men and
their families at the expense of our revenues
and national honor. A continuance of these
lamentable results will be a sad commentary
upon the wisdom of this Congress. Sebastian
Cabot, when he turned the shores of New-
foundland, prefigured a wiser policy. Columbus
advocated sounder economical principles on
the deck of his frail caravel when seeking new
acquisitions of commercial power for the mon-
arch of Castile and Arragon ; and Robinson
evinced a' stronger faith in the independence
and immense natural resources of our vast
territory when he sent his little flock on their
civilizing gospel errantry beyond the wild world
of waters.
The general realization of our naval weak-
ness, of the diminution of our merchant marine,
and of the humiliating displacement of our flag,
has caused the introduction of several legisla-
tive propositions for the consideration of this
Congress; and valuable suggestions may be
found in most of them, and in all there is a
cognate appeal for immediate and substantial
aid from the Government.
I cheerfully admit that the bills presented
by the committee, with others contemplating
41st Com. 2d Sess.—No. 22.
money subsidies, contain some wise provisions,
and have been ably advocated; yet I am con-
strained to oppose any method calculated to
deplete the national Treasury by the immense
sums required by annual money subsidies. It is
clearly the duty of Congress, as it has been
the policy of the Administration, to reduce
expenditures and abolish, as rapidly as found
consistent with the public interest, all war taxes
and imposts.
Let the subsidies be paid in wild land, under
a system which prevents abuses by speculation
and monopoly. Such regulations as are pro-
vided in the bill " to encourage the establish-
ment of a line of steamships under the flag of
the Union, for the conveyance of the mails of
the United States to European ports and ports
of India and China, and reducing the rates of
ocean postage, and for promoting emigration
from Europe to the southern States of the
Union," will develop the resources of unpro-
ductive territories. Under this plan the Gov-
ernment will be enriched and strengthened,
the advantages and proceeds of these land sales
will be equitably divided between the producer
and consumer, between the North and the
South, between the martsof commerce and the
wilderness. In this manner the Government
will build up a grand enterprise upon a perma-
nent basis, and in a much more economical
! way than by annual cash appropriations. It
j is about time that the older States realize a
I share of the advantages growing out of the ne-
cessary disposal of the public domain, and the
plan indicated in the bill referred to will effect-
ually do this, and can be carried into effect
without delay, without the expenditure of a
single dollar beyond that contributed now to
the foreign mail service.
Immediate relief must be afforded. The
country will no longer tolerate palliating legis-
lation on this subject.
Upon this Congress rests the grave responsi-
bility of protecting American interests abroad,
of giving employment to our skilled ship-build-
ers and machinists, of reviving the prosperity
and greatness of our oceanic commerce, and
of returning to our shores the stream of wealth
now flowing to the banks of England.
This generation has waged the battles of prin-
ciple under the old charter of freedom and the
new, without being indebted to the aristocracy
of England for a single expression of sympathy
or to her court for a single favor. The legiti-
macy of Great Britain's title to every rod
of soil she holds on this continent and the
supremacy she enjoys over our commerce are
expressed in the single word "force."
And now, in the fullness of time and with
the providence of God, we are permitted to
witness the coronation of our national pros-
perity; therefore let us settle some of our
grievances in the fields of commerce on the
southern Atlantic, where there is no English
realm to dictate boundary questions or Bulwer
treaties to exact copartnership advantages.
It is an easy task to illustrate in detail how
such direct communication as proposed in this
bill cannot but cheapen our imports, multiply
our exports, and give impulse to a very desir-
able class of immigration, while it must greatly
benefit our industry, especially American ship-
building, and strengthen and enlarge our naval
power.
lifPOKTS.
The most of the traffic between the countries
contemplated to be brought into direct com-
mercial intercourse with the United States is
now done in an indirect and fearfully expensive
way.
Austria, Italy, Portugal, southern Kussia,
Switzerland, southern Germany/Turkey, Egypt,
and India have no commerce worst naming
with our ports, yet we purchase large quantities
