DE SOTO, September 28, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

No truth in the report.

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General.

DE SOTO, September 28, 1864-12.10 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

The two regiments of cavalry that left Saint Louis this morning are at Pevely, on the railroad, sixteen miles north of the point where the direct road from Farmington to Saint Louis crosses the track. I have given them several orders in regard to picketing the road and scouting the country. Cavalry could pass to the west of them sufficiently far and not be seen. They are also picketing the roads back toward the Meramec. I have the infantry here and at the crossing of Big River, some eight miles south, well posted. I will inform the cavalry of Merrill's men.

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, September 28, 1864-5.10 p. m.

Major General A. J. SMITH,

De Soto:

Report from Franklin that the rebels have taken Richwoods, north part of Washington County, and intend to make a dash toward this city and the bridges on the Osage and Gasconade Rivers to-night.

JOHN V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

Some rebels appeared at Saint Marry's (on the river) to-day.

SAINT LOUIS, September 28, 1864-5.10 p. m.

Major General A. J. SMITH:

One thousand stand of arms and 40,000 rounds ammunition were sent to De Soot at General Ewing's request, and subject to his orders. If you don't need them send them back.

J. V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

DE SOTO, September 28, 1864-5.15 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Colonel Mills has fallen back from Big River bridge to this point to save his trains. I fear nothing yet in our front, but tremble for the safety of our trains should the enemy get in our rear and destroy the innumerable bridges between here and the Meramec, or even one of them. I have the bridges all well guarded, but the displacing of one rail would probably lose the train. I have cavalry out on all the approaches, and one squadron at Pevely. The enemy were reported to be advancing on the tunnel five miles south of this.

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General.
