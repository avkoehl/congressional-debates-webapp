APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Making public officers depositories—Mr. Wise.

Where is the waram? theyga^e? Where is the measure the)
took: lor sale y/ It they did foiesee it, and, foieseeina; it, gave
no alarm took no measures of safbty, they are—knaves' They
aie, undoubtedly, both knaves and tools'
Bin the Experiment has failed Why? is the next question
Su, why should this experiment have ¡ailed'? It was wholly
and solely m the con rol of the Executive If it has failed, the
Executive wholly and solely is to blame They can offer no
excuse, they have no pretext that their favoute banting has
expned under the unkind nursing of ns enemies The Admin
lstration assumed the enure responsibility, to di upen itself the
sole care, and wielded the whole power of originan* g, matur-
ing, regulating, and carrying out lis own experiment No mi
tionty can be blamed We were m a minority, and too weak
even to throw a stumbling block in the way ot its success, all
that we could do was lo predict its failure, and wofully has the
prediction been fulfilled1 The President alone removed the
depositee, he placed them wherever he pleased, on bia own
tetms, andundei his own rules For more than three years
did the public money lemain m the custody and control of the
Executive hand without authontv of or regulation by law
Congress was so yielding and obedient that it left its legidmate
powets derelict to Executive assumption The President,
without íestramt 01 limit, ordered the leceipts, safekeeping,
anl disbursements of the public funds at will, betook upon
himself to organize a confederation of local banks, obliged his
p tsto raise the minimum denomination of their notes, endea
\ no i to f nee them to constitute among themselves a system of
i itu nal exchange, backed them with Government credit to ac
c mimodate ti ide, legulated their íeceipts of local bank papei,
he is ued the Treasury encular to remove the specie basis oí
circulation, m short, was master of his own system Why did
it fail?
Su, theie is one lemarkable fact m the history of this failure,
which should not escape om attention, and which should be es
pecul'y noted foi our warning and our instiaction The dej o
sue act was passed by Congress m June, 1S36, and the very first
repon of the Secretarv of the Treasury Uieieafter for the fust
time gaye notice of difficulties m om finances From the re
mnval in 1833 up to that time, the time when Congress had
again asseited its power to regulate and contiol the deposite and
safe keeping of the public money, the note of the night watch
was, all is welll the system works well efficiently and safely,
even mor > ^o than did the Bank of the United States But the
momf ntthat Congreseagam assumed its poweis, the note was
changed, though darkly and dubiously No one would have
apprehended, oi dulappiohend, certain pascase* of the Secreta
rv'sieport, m Decernbei, 1836 as they must beundeistood now

' But since the passaae of th  act of Congress, of June 23d,
1836 'to íegu ate the deposites of the public meney,' most of
the discretional y power before exercised by this Department
on this subject, under previous laws and long usages, has been
considered as no longer po sewed, and vaiious solicitations to
us* it, though some of them were in cases of extreme hardship,
could not, theiefoie, be complied with Relies ed from gieat

feir, as to Mtss.ssjppi, I deuved my information from the
newspapers of the day It may be wrong I hope it is so, b*t,
if wrong, it affects not the general conclusion from all the facts
in the case, indej endent of the course of Mississippi The
quebtion still remains to be answeied by the Administration,
why has the Experiment failed in its hand*?
This question sir, brings us to the causes assigned by the
President 1 he Message says "The operations of credit are
so diversjfied and the influences which affect them se mime
rous, and often so subtle, tint even impartial and well
informed peison^are seldom found to agree in icspect to them "
Andytt sir, though this subject of credit and the causes which
affe< t it are so delicate and subtle though a measuie touching
tiade and finance and currency, and tlíe main snppou of all,
credi , tends nobody knows where, oi to what, and though
every safe and sagacious statesman will ever be íuled and
guided on this subject by the light of expenence, and the his
tory of what has been tiled in the ptst the late and the present
Executive have laid upon credit, finance, and currency the
rudest hands of baibansm itself, have knocked down every
fly wheel and legulator of tithei, havedeslroved all the ba
lances of trade, and have set the nnt hine in motion at an un
precedent d rate of \elocity towards self deduction—juit to
try experiments' If this subject he so delicate, why has it
beensohaishly tampeied with bvexperimenters'? The Message
continues
fct It was hai dly to be expected that those who disappro\ ed of
the policy of the Government in reluion to the cutrency would
fail to attribute to that policy ¡ny extensive embma^ment m

connected with the pas ions and conflicts oí psitv, ett It i°,

aggregate of the increased capitals, circulation and deposites
To test the question, whether the Bank of the United States
tended to pievent an increase of banking capital, you have only
to compare die mciease of banking capital in the periods when
the bank did not exist with the periods during v> Inch it did exist

"Thus, in ten years, from 1820 to lbJO, the increase of hank
capital in the United Sutes wab only eight millions of dollars,
whcieas in the six following years—no not bix, but only five
and a half—the increase amounted to the piodigioussum ofona
bundled and eighty one millions*"
Sn, this veiymciea^e of banking capital, issuos, loans, and
discounts, of which th*> Piesident now complains so much, was
caused by l the Government '—the Executive itself, in warring
upon and dei-uojinc; the United States Hank, and wasencou-
laee 1 by the Executive in stimulating the local banks with the
public dtpositts It was a pan of the Experiment itsell to
