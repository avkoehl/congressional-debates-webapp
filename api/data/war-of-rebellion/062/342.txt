Colonel Fonda, of the cavalry, reports that his reconnaissance yesterday resulted in seeing nothing of the enemy in the direction of Jackson. He learned form negroes that there is a rebel force at Jackson, and that the enemy had strengthened their pickets this side.

(Received 7 p. m.)

Brigadier-General STONE,

Chief of Staff:

Have nothing to report worthy of notice this evening. There were various reports of there being a Confederate force about 300 strong this side the Amite River last night. I made every preparation for them. It is my impression they intend to surprise the telegraph station, but I do not to have it occur.

The general commanding desires to be informed what cavalry passed up from Thibodeaux to the Grossetete and West Baton Rouge yesterday, and who the commander of the party was. It is suspected that they passed through or near Plaquemine, and that you can give the information.

(Received 6 p. m.)

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff:

I would respectfully inquire whether any regiment will be sent to Brashear to take the place of the Ninety-first. The One hundred and thirty-first is only 340 strong, and hardly sufficient for picket and guard duty. All quiet in this district.

E. L. MOLINEUX,

Colonel, Commanding.
