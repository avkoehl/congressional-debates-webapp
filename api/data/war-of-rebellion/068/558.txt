GENERAL: General Brooks and his whole command returned last evening as soon as the wounded were removed. Colonel Dutton reported to you while here that General Brooks was then falling back. He has not yet received reports from all the brigades that were with him, but thinks 200 will cover his entire loss. I have received your order for the movement of to-morrow.
