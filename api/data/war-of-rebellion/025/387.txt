a wire except through the assistant superintendent when he could be reached. The assistant superintendent of this department it is impossible for me to get along with. I arrested him and notified operators of the fact, and that his orders would not be obeyed. Colonel Stager was notified of his arrest.

Owing to the bad condition of the roads do not move McArthur's division any farther from their supplies.

OXFORD, MISS., December 5, 1862.

Brigadier General C. S. HAMILTON, Abbeville, Miss.:

I ordered up the remainder of Logan's division yesterday and one of yours to come to-day. Learning that Logan's supplies could not reach him to march yesterday, you were ordered to send a division as soon as practicable. The rain of last night making the roads so bad, you were then directed not to move any farther from you supplies. There has been system enough, but some failure in my dispatches reaching you.

BETHEL, TENN., [December] 5, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

Courier came just now. Artillery heard in the direction of Pocahontas, and, I think, just east of that place. Possibly, if Hurlbut is out, it may be him; he has forces moving threatening the rebels. None of my scouts are in yet from that direction.

LA GRANGE, TENN., December 5, 1862.

Captain T. H. HARRIS, Assistant Adjutant-General:

The following information has just been received from below Davis' Mill:

Mitchell's band has made another raid upon the forces below us, killing one of the Twenty-ninth Illinois Volunteers. His band is increasing daily, and will have two pieces of artillery here within a few days. Now is the time to bag him. We could do it easily with the help of 40 or 50 more cavalry for a few days, and if we should neglect now his annoyance will be constant.

I will send communication to-morrow. Have asked several questions which remain unanswered.

A. S. NORTON,

Colonel, Commanding.
