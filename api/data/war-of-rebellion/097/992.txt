HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 28, 1865-12.15 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK:

Dispatch of 11.35 received and forwarded to General Wright. Your attention, however, is called to General Wright's dispatch yesterday, reporting his occupation of Danville and that the enemy had removed to Greensborough all of the rolling stock of the Danville and Greensborough road. The gauge of this road being the narrow gauge, the rolling stock of the Danville road can be not be used on it. Under these circumstances I do not see how General Wright can extend his railroad communications beyond Danville.
