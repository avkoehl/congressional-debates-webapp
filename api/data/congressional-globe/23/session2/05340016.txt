16                                          THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                          December 4.
This amount of balance against the Depart-
ment has been consideiably íeduced since the
1st of July last
On the 1st day of the present month it s*ood
as follows
Amount due for loans from banks     $275,000 00
Amount of over-checks, November
1,1834.....................     55,969 09
Making together the sum of......$330,969 09
On the  same  day  the balance  of
bank deposits in favor of the Do
partment, constituting the amount
of cash on hand, amounted to..,      82,031 34
greater sum dunng the year when the session Is!
piotiacted, than during the alternate yeai To
mike a fan comparison between the amount of
ftee letteis bcfoie and aftei the extension of the
flanking privilege, it is necessaiy to take two
entire yeais Thus The allowance to post-
masters foi the dehveiy of fiee letteisfor the two
years ending July 30, 1832, (before the exten
sion,)was........... ..       $40,ao6 89
For the two years ending July 1,1834,
(aftei the extension,) was........54,158 88
Making the actual balance of the ac-
counts with banks, against the
Department, on the. 1st of No
vember, 1834 ................    248,937 75
The contracts for the southern section, includ-
ing the States of Viigima, North Carolina, South
Carolina,and Greoigia, and the Tcrntoiy of Ploi-
lda, which will expire with thf curient year,
have been i ene wed, to take effect fiom the 1st ot
January next, on such terms as will effect an an-
nual saving fiom the amount nowpaidfoi tians
poitation in that section, of about ¿120,000
Additional ictrenchments have also been made
in the expense of tianspoitation, subsequent to
mv last leport, to the annual amount of about
$59,000, m ilung tog (her an annual saving, fiom
the 1st of Januai v next, of $179,000
Prom the savings thus effected, together with
the cum tut excels of levenue in fcivoi of the De
partment, it may be safely calculated that, with
out any reliance upon an increase in the gioss
amount of postages, the revenues of the Depait
ment will exceed its expenditures, during the
ensuing ealendai year, to the amount of £,270,000
Prom a careful estimate, it may be anticipated,
with cntne confidence, that befoie the close of
the jeai 1835 the wholctbalance of debt against
the Depaitment will be extinguished No pait
of this debt was eonti acted upon the ciedit of the
Treasury, noi upon anyothei credit oi authority
than that of the Department alone
It was nevei legaided by tithei of the parties
in the characte r of a debt of Government, but a
mere expedient to anticipate the lcsouices of the
Depaitment, based upon the ciedit oí those íe
souices alone
The means of its liquidation within a reason-
able time wore alw lys \vithin the legal contiol of
the head of the Dtpai tment and no othei means
have at my time been sought oi desued by the
Depai tment
In my repoit of Novombei, 1833, the expense
foi tianspoiting the mail, and foi incidentals,
liom Julj 1 to December 31,1833, was estimated
at...................          §1,061,044 71
llie actual expense foi that peiiod
was........................1,061,199 97
Varying from the estimate only ..            §444 74
The net pioceod  of postages for
the ye u ending 30th June, 1834,
were then estim ited at     ...     $2,037,410 81
The actud net piocceds of post-
ages foi that year were........1,927,644 44
Falling below the estimate by the
sum of.......................   $109,766 37
Thus it appears that the expenses of the De
paitment have not essentially vaned from the
estimates, but the net levenue ansing fiom post-
ages has fallen short of the estimates then made
moie than a hundred thousand dolíais this
is believed to be, in a very consideiablo degiee,
attributable to the gieat mciease of fiee letteis
The piogressivc mciease*of population natuially
brings with it an accumulation of business m the
executive offices, which tends, in some measure,
to mciease then conespondenee, and in addition
to this, a law passed m March, (833, extending
to membeis of Congiess the pnvilege of franking
duung the whole íecess Every other yeai, the
session of Congiess is protracted to a much
gieatei length than in the alternate year, when a
Congress terminates
The expenses for the delivery of free letters, at
two cents each, have always amounted to a much
Making, since the extension, an m
ciease of..................    $13,601 99
Oi payment for the delirexy of 680,099 fiee let-
teis more than weie delivered the two pieceding
years But no allowance is made for the delrvti y
of fiee letteis at post offices wheie the postinas
ters' commission!  exceed $500 a quaiter
If the same propoiaon of fiee letteis is dehv
eied at offices wheie no allowances foi them aie
made to postulasteis, as atthc smallei offices, then
the  mciease since  the flanking pnvilege was
extended, is equal to 960,000 free letteis moie
than weie deliveied within the sime peiiod of
time piloi   to tint extension     The postage on
each of  these letteis, if not fiee, would be fiom
six cents to two doll us     The aveiage, it is be
lieved, would not be less than twenty five cents
each, exclusive of the postmasters'commissions
If estimated at this aveiage, they would  tniount
to......................     ¡,240,000
To tint, add the allowance actually
made foi their dehveiy..........    13,601 99
Foi the year ending June 30, 1834,
it was..................1,927,644 44
And the increase of free letteis within
the last two yeais has actually cost
the Depaitment............£,253,601 99
which is more than equal to the balance ot debt
at this time existing against the Depaitment
Estimates have been obtained fiom scveial of
the executive offices, of the amount of then offi
eial conespondenee earned on through the Post
Office estabhshmi nt undei the flanking pnvilege
of the officeis by whom it is conducted, and it
appears thatfiomt'ie DepaitmentsofStatc,Tieas-
uiy, Wai, and Navy, including the sub-offices of
the Tietsuiy and Navy, the official conespond
ence by mail, on which no postage is paid,is es
timated to be equal to 2,085,235 single fiee let-
teis in a yeai, and that by fai lilt gitatcr piopoi-
tion of them aie sent the full distance foi which
the highest iatc of postage would be chaigeable
The aveiage postage on those letteis, if not fiee,
It is  belli ved would be not less than 18J   cents
each, which would amount to $,503,481 56
|     11ns estimate is exclusive of the offices of the
j Attorney Geneial, Adjutant General, Commis
saiy Geneial, Inspeetoi Geneial, Uuaiteimaster
Geneial, Paymastei Geneial, and Supeuntendent
I of the Patent Office, all of whom have the pnvi-
lege of fraukin0     It is also estimated that the
I numbei of fice letteis passing undei the fiank of
members of Congiess, amounts to 8,000 a day
I during the session
J If the toiiespondence of the offices above men-
tioned, which aie notembiaccd in the estimate,
and the postages fanly estimated which woi Id be
chaigeable on the conespondenee of membeis of
Congiess, if not fiee, should be added to the
statement, it is believed that the annual amount
of free letteis would not fall short of a million
of dolíais, exclusive of the conespondenee of the
Post Office Depaitment itself
This is an annual contnbution by the Depart-
ment to the Government
Though the amount of revenue ansing fiom
postages, for the yeai ending June 30, 1834, did
not equal the estimate, yet there was a consider
able increase abo\e the amount of the preceding
year     The gross amount of postages for the year
ending J une 30, 1833, was    .....$2,616,538 27
Foi the yeai ending June 30,1831,
it was......................2,823,706 97
Making an increase  in the gross
amount of...................  §207,163 70
The  net amount of postages, after deducting
commissions to postmasters, and the contingent I
expenses of then offices, was, for the yeai endme I
June 30, 1833..................¡,1,790,254 05 i
Making an incicase in the net pro-
ceeds of....................    $137,389 79
The finances of the Department continue to be
in an impioving condition, and the solicitude
which has been shown to obtain mail contracts,
the reduced lates at which they have been taken
foi the southern section, and the zeal with which
contracto!s generally persevere m thin services
to the Depaitment, furnish ample deroonstiation
that its ciedit is ummpaned
The numbei of post offices in the United
States was, on the 1st of Julylast, 10,693, being
an increase of 566 over the number lepoited last
year
The annual amount of transportation has been
but slightly vaned since my last repoit The
mail is now earned in stages and steamboats
about 16,900,000 miles ayeai and on horseback,
and in silkies, about 8 600,000 miles, making
togethei about 25,500,000 miles a year
The cell ntv of the mail should ah\ ays be equal
to the mot npid tiansition of the tiavclei and
that which shortens the time of communication,
and facilitates the intercourse between distant
places, is like bringing them nearei together
While it affords convenience to men of business,
it tends to counteiact local piejudices, by enkug-
mg the spheie of acquaintance
It perpetuates existing friendships,and creates
new ones, by which the bonds of union aie
stiengtheneel, and the happiness of society pio-
moted These oonsideiations have always had
then full weight upon mv mind m making im-
piovements in mail opei vtions
The multiplication of laihoads m diffcientparts
of the country promises, within a few yeais, to
give gieatiapidity to the moví ments of traveléis
and it is a subject worthy of mquny, whether
measures may not now be taken to secuie the
transportation of the mail upon them' Aheady
have the i ulroadsbctween rienehtovvn, in Maiy-
land, and New Castle, hi Delawaie, ind between
Camden and Amboy, m New jeisey, aftoided
gieat and important facilities to the tiansmission
of the great eastern mail The laihoad between
this city and Baltimoie will soon be complet d,
and the distance fiom the post office m this plac
to that of Baltimore will not be imteiially varied
from the pr sent load, 38 miles
From Bal mioie by Port Deposit, m Maij-
¡and, to Coatesville, in Pennsylvania,the line foi
a lailroad is located, and the stock subsenbed foi
its completion, and fiom Coatesville to Philadel-
phia a raihoad is made and in opeiation
The distance between Baltimore and Philadel-
phia, on this road, will be 117 miles, about 18
miles grcatoi than the piesent luid loute Fiom
Philadelphia to Trenton bridge, about 28 miles,
the raihoad is neaily completed and fiom New
Biunswickjin New Teisej , to Jeisey City, on the
west side of the Hudson nvei, opposite the city
of New York, 30 milts, the railroad is in i state
of progress When those woiks shall be corn
pleted, the only mttivd will bo between Tiei ton
and New Brunswick, about 26 miles, to complete
an entne íaihoad between this place and the city
of New Yoik, and it cannot be supposed that the
enteipusing State of New Jeisey will long delvy
to peí feet a communication of such greatimpoit
anee, passing through most of hci laigest uid most
flourishing towns When this shall be done, the
whole dista ice between this city md NcvYoil ,
on a continuous raihoad, will not exce d 240
miles and the journey may be peifoimed u all
times with ccitainty, allowing ample time foi
stopping at lmpoitaut places on the load, in 16
houis, ind ordinarily in a shortei peiiod
If provision can be made to  ecuit the íegulai
transpoitation of the mail upon this, and upon
othei ruiioads which are constructing, and in
some instances aheadv finished, it will be of
gieat-utility to the public otherw lse, these cor-
porations may become exorbitant m then de-
mands, and prove eventually to be dangeious
monopolies
I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your
humble seivant,
