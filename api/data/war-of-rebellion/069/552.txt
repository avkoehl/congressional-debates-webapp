U. S. Volunteers:

GENERAL: I am directed by Colonel Cesnola to inform you that I am in command of a provisional organization, consisting of 600 armed men of various regiments, and am posted with my left on the road about three-fourths of a mile in rear of your right, and my line extends obliquely toward the rear, covering the position of General Wilson's headquarters. Any change in your position can be communicated to me by the orderly bearing this. Mu command is not reliable, being stragglers and recruits.
