HEADQUARTERS,Saint Louis, Mo., September 24, 1864.

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

The evidence is strong that we are to have a very formidable invasion by Southeast Missouri. Price has ten brigades of mounted infantry, and will arm the O. A. K.'s in the State whenever he can. The advance, 5,000 strong, with four pieces of artillery, was in Frdericktown to-day. We shall use every available means to defend ourselves, but our force is weak and scattered over the State. If we destroy the forage we have in Southwest Missouri, we shall not be able to occupy it this winter, hence I have kept Sanborn there to the last.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, September 24, 1864.

Governor HALL,

Jefferson City:

Shelby reported at Fredericktown, with 4,000 or 5,000 men and four pieces of artillery. Nothing definite of Price except that he was reported at Pocahontas some days since. Will have to call out all the militia of the Central District, Southeast District, and Rolla District, but will not call them until we are certain.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, September 24, 1864.

Mr. BARLOW,

Superintendent Iron Mountain Railroad:

While Shelby's raid is in progress keep your rolling-stock well in hand for use in transportation troops for patrolling. The scarcity of cavalry renders this necessary. A tender should precede trains of troops to avoid accidents. Let us know with whom we can communicate at all hours.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

DE SOTO, September 24, 1864.

General ROSECRANS:

Your dispatch is received and will be cheerfully complied with.

Respectfully,

S. D. BARLOW,

President and Superintendent.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 24, 1864.

Major J. HOUGH,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Jefferson Barracks:

I will be down in the morning (Sunday). The division will probably move on Monday morning; have everything in readiness.

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General.
