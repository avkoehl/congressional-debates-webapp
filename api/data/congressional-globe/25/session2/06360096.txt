to judge , and it has no j addiction of the question
of who shall be members of this body, except so
far as that question u involved m the decision ot
their election, return, and qualification Without
an election, then, no jurisdiction would be con-
tened upon the House, and of course if any at-
tempt was made to decide as tn the case proposed,
such decnion would be void The distinction be-
tw een a case like this, and one in which the House
has decided most palpably wrong, is obvirus, at
least to every lawyer here In the first case, as I
have admitted, the decision would be absolutely
void , while, in the last, it would be obligatory so
long a  it continued unreversed
I have remarked, sir, that I was well satisfied
that the election in July is valid, but, for the
sake of the argument, let us suppose it to be other-
wise Upon what groun 1 I would a^k, can it be
contended here, that tne ioroe ol that decision, de-
claring it valid, the House having jurisdiction ol
the subject matter, wouid be impaired1 That de-
c sion must be either entitled to its full (orce, or it
mujt be void, it cannot occupy a middle ground ,
for although it might be subject to reversal ior the
error, jet it would continue valid until reveistd
If void, of course it could hue no influence up< u
the subsequent emotion, in die point of view m
which I am now considering the question , and the
subsequent election would be good oi not, aecoi l-
mg to other cncuinstani.es attending u 11 in full
lorce, upon the other hand, the com msion must
be, that the election held in violation of it w is
void Nor would the recision oi that resolution
afterwards changa theiesult, upon any principle
with which 1 am acquainted It is irue that a
crime prohibited by st itute is not punishable after
its repeal This, howovei, depends upon a very
different piineiple fiom lhat which is contended foi
in the case under considention In thatcise the
discharge is produced irom the huiianily of the
law in favor ot life But, sir, upon what prmei-
ple can it be contended in this case that the iepe.il
of a law, the existence of which prevented the cie-
ation of title to a civil right, can opetalc to create
if* The law being m existí nee at the time, fixed
its character and effect, w Inch could n< t be ch mg< d
hy the mere negitive influente ol its r¡) eal
I will puisne this point in the aigumenil no
further twr really, sir, after the 1 est i xamni itio i
which I have bom able to give this question 1 find
i u ground for doubt even is to the conclusiveness
ol till' point, noi hive I been turnished with any
by the ingenuit/of ¡hose who have elaborated it
so extensively   upon the other side <>f the question
I feel now, Mi Speaker, that I have show n con
olusively that the resolution under consideration,
declaring Messrs Prentiss and Word not entitled
to seat  as membeis upon this floor Irom the fetatt
of Mississippi, ought to be adopted, and, so fir is
that inquiry is concerned, 1 have no fuiiher riimrk
to make But, sn, tins is not the only question
now under the consideiation of the House It is
true, sir, that a vote has been uUcn testing the
strength of the first resolution, which proposes to
rescind the lesolu'itm of the House at the calk I
session, declaring the sitting members, Me^ r
Claiborne and GhoKon, duly elected members 1

probible, not lo say certain,that if will be adiptod
It is not, how eve i, jet done, and viewing it ?s [
do, the heaviest blow that has ever been aunee1 u
the institutions ot my country, I will continue in
hope th i a kind Piovidcnce, to whose guird in
care we owe the oreitoi in J centimunce of cur
happy form of Go rrnme i , \ ill interpose some

corsuomiKii ••iimincl fern the Chair And
here, sir, peir it me to sav thit 1 view the
course taken upon tms subject w th great
alarm, as setting the most dangerous prece-
dent, and irom the number of those win ire
m favor of its adoption, and particih'j
when I find the members of greite t age at t
expeneree among that number, 1 teel thtJ the
danger to be apprenended is near at hand
I may be told, sir, that my fears are feo easily ex-
cited I trust it may so turn out, hut I have no
expectation that it will    I have looked with pain-
ful anxiety into the history of (his House and the
Senate for a precedent for this couise, but m vain
I have also examined into the history of the Par-
liament of England for one, with the same suc-
cess I challenge the oldest and the w ísest in this
House, sir, to produce an act m which the princi-
ple involved in this inquiry has been recognised m
the proceedings ot either branch of Congress, or
any other similarly constituted body I shall feel
under obligation to any one who will point me to
a precedent, loi if my feais aie groundless, I wish
to be relieved fiom them If, sir, there is no prece-
dent, I entreat gentlemen to pause and reflect be-
fore they inflict this heavy blow upon our institu-
tions and Government
We have heard fiom the gentleman fiom Ten-
nessee (Mr Bür) the admission that party consi-
derations have had influence upon this decision,
and indeed, s r, it is too obvious to any one who
w ill look t  the votes and the advocates upon either
side of it. But for that influence, I cannot behevs
that we should be tioubled with this investigation
When, sir, the proposition was made by the appli-
cants for seats here, I did not suppose tor one mo-
ment that it would be senously entertained, and
in 'eeel, sn, when it was releired to the Committee
oi Flections, I supposed it wis done ¡no Jouna
meielj, as a resptctlul way ot disposing of the
subject I coulel not then believe that even the
devotion to party, which had been manifested here
upon so many íeccnt occasions, would beptrmitied
upon that to make any gentleman for¿etins coun-
try I did suppose respect for ourselves and our
decisions, and die impoitance of continuing a re-
spectful consideration of them by others, would
ha\e forbid us fiom tieating as mere idle matters
the solemn decisions of this House, even were it
viewed as a question oí policy But, sn, how
much less did I suppose that genllemen heie would
beat lightly their elecision, by which wis vested Ih'e
dearest lights of an Am rican citizen. Sir, it seems
to be forgotten by the House that any light or pri-
vilege was confureil bj the rest lution oi the called
«s.sion upon the sittin/ members horn Missisuppi,
loi ceitainlj, if renxmbereel, they would be icccg-
nised What, sir, would be jour course if, after
tin idoption oí the resolutie n which I am now con-
sulting, the silting members should take their
seats upon this llooi, and demand to take put in
the action of this House—demand the n$,ht to de-
bate anel vote upon the subjects hefoie us—would
jou, sn, feel satisfied that you, as the presiling of-
ficer of this bodv, would he authorized lo lefuse
to permit them to do so, thus depriving thein of
ptivileges conft rred upe n thorn and their constitu-
ents by this House, while they remain unexpelkd
by the constitutional majonty I hope, sir, this
tlelieate and grave questi m may not be presented
to you for decision You would find no pieeedent
lor ynur guide, 'ir, out of fhe e.rcat number of dc-
eisions made by thi, House, ti uehing every legiti-
mate subject fe I Had teimition, this would not, m
piineiple, s r, be found to be "irs adjudícala"
Upon you, sn, would devolve a only that the

So 'ir as the principle i concerned, I should be
gl id to see it tested, and if, s r, contrary to what I
suppose would be \our course, you should execute
hcvoilordei oí the House, then, indeed, would
iou heir i voice, lavd and ion , not only from
Mi sissippi, but from every part of this Union,
which would make this House not only feel its
nror, but prepare it for a willing correction of it
This resolution, if adopted, will, in violation of
all principle, do that, indirectly, which it cannot do
directly Its effect, when executed, will be to ex-
pel from this House the representatives of a sove-
reign State, by a bare majority,when, by the Constitu-
tion which we have sworn to support, it could oaly
be effected by two-thirds of this body. And, sir, in
what estimation will our acts be held by the com-
munity, when they see this House rescinding a
most solemn resolution of a former" session, vesting
the most important rights .a individuals, and secur-
ing them to a sovereign State of this Union, in viola-
tion of every principle of the Constitution and laws
of this land, in the absence of all precedent, and
without any ground for impeaching that resolution.
All must conclude, that rights which depend upon
the unstable decisions of this House, are of but lit-
tle value So much, sir, do I consider the value of
stability in our decisions, that if I had no other
reason for doing so than to secure that object, I
would not vote for the recision, were my right to a
seat here dependent upon it. Nay, sir, neither of-
fice nor place could induce me thus to bring into
disrepute our solemn determinations by the esta-
blishment of such a precedent. Carry out the prin-
ciple which we are now about to establish, and
where will it lead us, and where is it to end' The
term, sir, of our presiding officer is to continue so
long as the party to which he may belong shall com-
pose the majority of this House, and no longer, in-
stead of the term of a Congress, as heretofore. In-
deed, sir, the whole organization of the House is to
depend, for its duration, upon the ups and downs of
parly In one word, sir, we are cut loose from all
the usages and fixed principles of our fathers,
which were esteemed by them to be indispensable
to the perpetuity of this our happy form of Govern-
ment, ancl are at sea without compass or rudder t i

about to make, must be coriected by the people,

REMARKS OF MR. SMITH,
Of Main*,,
In the House of Representatives, January 5. 1838—
On the subject of British  aggressions  on the
northern frontier of the United States.
Mr SMITH said he did not rise with any dispo-
sition to detain the House more than a few mo-
ments, and particularly as the resolutions touching
the matter immediately before the ¡louse had been
so amended as to produce a veij obvious unanimity
on the part oí the House in their favor But (said
Mr S ) I cannot consent to close this debate, wuh
out calling i he attention ot the House to a portion
of the lemarks made by the honorable cha rman of
the Committee on Foreig i \flair,(Mr Ilcaard,)
when he last addressed the House
The difheulties existing in relation to tne boun-
dary of the United btates on the e\ue ne northea t,
arc of i kindred cbarieter tc those wh.ch have ex
e ited the indignation, and, I r.nj saj, 1-udable zeal
of the honorable gentlemen from New Yor who
have address d the House, and they hive inevita-
bly been associated together in this debate But I
understand the honorable gentleman from Mary-
land, (who is chairman of the Committee on Fo-
reign Affairs in this House,) that there is no dispo-
sition to press the border difficulties and disputed
boundary on the frontier of the State which I have
the honor to represent in part upon this floor, upon
i ii coi sidenr on of either the British Government
or i í thiN House at the present time, or to attempt
ny settlement of them JNow, sir, I wish to know
wnclhcr that gentleman is to be understood as ex-
pressing coirectly the feeling and sense of the pre-
sent Administration, or of his committee, or of this
House, in this pai'icular?
Mr Howard hete rose to explain He had
merely stated his personal opinion He had not
stated it as the opinion of the committee, nor had
he said that he felt no dispositien to press for a
settlement of the question of boundary, but, as it
had been said by some gentlemen that we seemed
to be on the eve of a war with Great Bntain, he
