HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,Lexington, Ala., December 30, 1864-4.30 p.m.

Orders of the day for the Fourth Army Corps for to-morrow, December 31, 1864:

The enemy having been driven over the Tennessee River, by direction of Major-General Thomas, the pursuit will be continued no longer. This corps will move to Huntsville and Athens, Ala., and will start on the march at 7 a.m. to-morrow, the 31st instant-Brigadier-General Beatty's division will lead, followed by General Kimball's division, then General Elliott's. Each division will constitute a column by itself, preceded by all of its pioneers, formed into a brigade, who will repair, roads, and make crossings over the creeks, and followed by all the trains of the same, with one battery of artillery. One regiment will be detailed from each division to accompany its train and artillery, to assist them in moving. The supply train that arrived to-day will not be sent back to Pulaski, as directed this morning, but will accompany the troops in the march, each division taking its own section. The reserve battery will follow the trains of the rear division of the corps; the artillery ammunition will follow the reserve battery; and the hospital train will follow the artillery ammunition; until otherwise ordered, corps headquarters will follow the ammunition train of the leading division during the march. The leading division of the corps will be conducted by a staff officer from these headquarters.

By order of Brigadier-General Wood:

J. S. FULLERTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Brigadier-General KIMBALL:

GENERAL: Three days' rations for your division are just arriving at this point; they must be issued to last five days. As soon as your train is unloaded send it to the rear, and direct the officer having charge of it to report to Surgeon Patterson, One hundred and twenty-fourth Ohio, at Pulaski, for the purpose of transporting sick and wounded from that point to the terminus of the railroad.

By order of Brigadier-General Wood:

J. S. FULLERTON,

Lieutenant Colonel, Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

(Same to Generals Elliott and Beatty.)
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,Lexington, Ala., December 30, 1864-3 p.m.

Brigadier-General KIMBALL:

The general commanding directs that you send your ordnance officer to Pulaski at once, to turn over the ammunition now in your train at that place, and then to bring forward the empty train to your command, at Huntsville (via Athens) or Athens, whichever place it may be at. The object in turning over the ammunition is to lighten the train; more can be procured via railroad, if it is needed.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. S. FULLERTON,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Same to Generals Elliott and Beatty.)
