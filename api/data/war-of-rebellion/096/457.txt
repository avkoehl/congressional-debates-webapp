back to Ninth Corps. The cavalry will be in its old position, and will then picket from Halifax road to James River. From this you will see that your corps will not return to old camps.

(Same to Major-General Humphreys.)
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,February 7, 1865. (Received 7.40 p. m.)

General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

The firing you heard about 6 p. m., if in this direction, was an attack of General Crawford's upon the enemy, which drew their artillery fire. I have had no report from him since it began; it now has ceased.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,February 7, 1865-6.45 p. m.

General WEBB:

I have received your dispatch requiring us to occupy a new position and forsake our old quarters. We will do it cheerfully, and, for my part, I am glad that, when any extension of our line is to be made, we have the privilege of doing it. All is satisfactory with us to-day. Wheaton's division can be recalled at any time.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,February 7, 1865-7 p. m.

General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

General Wheaton's division can be withdrawn at any time you may desire. I do not need it to hold my position.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.
