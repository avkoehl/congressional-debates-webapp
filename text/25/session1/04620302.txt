25th Cokg... 1st Skss._______________Making public officers depoútories~Mr. Calhoun
neet with it the proposed system of sub-Treasuries,
designating the kind of cjrrency w hich tne Govern-
ment is to demand, and you fix upon the c< untry
at once a Treasury bank in its. worst form I can-
not shut my eyes upon the suggestion which has
been made in another branch by a distinguished
and now willing advocate of all these measure , that
the Government ought to provide for an emission
of paper money, declaring his opinion, at the same
time, that convertible paper does not constitute a suit-
able currency I belie* e the same opinion has been
avowed during the debate m this house Such a
proposition would carry us back at once to the old
continental money so monstrous a proposition
shows most convincingly the dangerous caieei we
have before us, in consequence of departing fr)m
a financial system that had been reared up< n the
foundation ol a long and successful experience.
1 have voted, sir, in favor of an amendment of
the Tieasury note bill, to authorize the Government
to i aiM , by loan, such sum of money as the actual
wants of the Treasu ry demanded That is the mo le
of raising money which the constitution has desig-
nated " Congress shall have power to borrow
money on the credit of the United Statts " I see
no reason for departing from this plain requisition
of the constitution I see every reason, in the
avowed and obvious disposition of the Government
to resort to experiments, why we should adhere sti ici-
ly and guardedly to such a requisition I repeat,
sir, that I am willing to vote for any sum of money
that shall be needed to relieve the Government
from its embarrassments, but I am not Milling to
do so in any way but that which shall be clear, safe,
and m accordance with the letter and spir t if the
constitution
The sub-Treasury scheme, or bill imposing addi-
tional duties as depositaries on public officers, 15
confessedly the leading and distinguishing measure
of the session It has been characterized, and, I
think, ¡ustly, as a proposition to detach the 111 resis
of the Goveminent fr>m thost of the people , to give
to the Government a " better cunency, ' and to the
people such a one as they shall feel willing, or be
compelled, to content themselves vuth This lep-
resentation, I know, has been denounced, as if it
were intentionally used a& the watchword of party
Were it really such, I would freely join in the de
nunciatton But I look upon it a- accurately de
scriptive of the bill Such are the whole tenoi and
scope of it and the only w ay m which, under the
operation of this measure, there can b a commu-
nity oí interest and of feeling between Gover iment
and people, will be bj the universal adoption of he
same scheme When ihat event occurs, we «-h ill
have arrived at the much-talked of age o' m esclu-
sa e metallic cunency II this measuie shall re-
ceive the sanction of Congress, and pass into the
solemn form of a liw, the conflict will be but c >m
menced between the system to which the ccuniry
has been accustomed from theeailiest days of the
republic, and that system which bears upon its fi mt
the baptismal name of "unt led expedient " It is
plain to suppose that this w'iole people will quietly
and unrepining'y wiinessthe exhibition of their o 11
servants in the indispuied enjowncnts of a high
privilege, and themselves excUded from ill oartici-
pation in it A stormy and wrathful c ntest w ill
ame, upon which, even as a fancy ske eh, no p t-
not can look with composure Sir Í cainut join
m the eriisa le, u hie b t le a l< ption c f 11 s ne si re,
as the settled policy of the Governmen, cum >t but
beat np against the lonq; s andina or lei of things I
will not cins'nt nnhley.ly topuU don n an mcicnt
institution, until I can be ct ívmcel that the sub
stitute for it shd 1 bet pi ans er the purp so I am
comented, nay, anxi ms to rpfoim, «here re orm is
necessary , b it I cannoi vield to whit I feel confi-
dent must b' tl e effect if this bit, if earned through
to its outside purpc    s     I cannot a<nee to disiioj
This, then, is the stable and firm ground upon
■which I plant myself in op| osition to this sub Trea-
sury scheme Cirned oaf into all its consequences,
the effect ol it must b , to change the fnmevv irk of
society, to revolutionize pr perl} and business to
reduce the former m'elm ij,anrl most ess-mtia1-
ly, and to withdraw the lat er into the hai ds of the
few, to circumscribe, and almost to obliterate the
field for enterprise, to paral; ze credit   to deaden
the vigorous arm of industiy , and finally, and in
one word, to give to wealth that ascendency which
nothing but free competition can break doivn, ana
to make poverty hug its chains moie closely Whilst
the tendency of this scheme must be to give superior
and unjustifiable privileges to wealth in large ac-
cumulations, and necessarily to make the poor
poorer, the blight and mildew of it must tall m a
special manner upon that immense mass of our
community, which, I would to God, v,'<ne the one
and only mass—the men of moderate property, and
of enterprise chastened and well regalated
Mr Chairman, I will aot dwell upon the numer-
ous objections which are urged against this bill, w ith
great force, as a mattei of business Its insecurity
forms of itsell an abundant reason why it should be
distrusted and repudiated The placing of public
funds in the hands of individuals for safe keeping
or disbursement, leads the depositary into that temp-
tation from which every prudent man should pray
to be dehv ered The importunities of friendship
alone have, through this means, dragged down many
an honest name to the dust The field of such temp-
tation should be hedged in as much as possible, not
enlaiged Gentlemen have re'erred already to sad
cases of defalcation from this source in several of
the States The Commonwealth from which I come
is not without this stain upon its history And w hat
is the experience which the records of one depart-
ment of this Government have recently furnished 1
Within the last eight 01 ten jears, over eighteen
hundred instances of defalcation are officially re-
ported to have occurred in the Post Office Depart-
ment Who does not know that most or all of tne
motives in the way of temptation either do not
operate at all, or to a very limited extent, m regard
to funds entrusted to corporations'? Sir, these are
considerations which ought to address themselves
with great seriousness to wise and discreet statemen
The necessary increase of Executive pationage
1-, also a solid objection to this bid Such patron-
age, operating upon the individual, is always dan
gerous The state of public sentiment in this coun-
try points with singulai sigmficanoy to the sober
truth, that such patronage "has increased, is in-
creasing  and ought tobe diminished "
Mr Chairman, I pass to the leading objection to
this bill, which I am compelled to dispose of briefly,
in consequence of our being very nearly at the last
stage of the deliberations of the session This bill
dcnie in the face of the country the obligation on
the part of the Government to Airnish a sound sys-
tem of current y and of domestic etchani'es The
doctrines of the nyssaje upon tfus point tip entire-
ly new Rut they arc new only because the Gov-
ernment, or rather the Admmistntion, instead of
wisely retiacingthtn steps, aiedeteimined to goon
with their experiments, and suieh it cannot be
strange that these experiments should interfeie with
the provisions of the constitution a* will is with
the prosperity ff the people The Mmtmstration
having resolved by this meas up to detach then in-
terests from those of the people, it neecssanh fol a\°
that the mt "rests of the people are not to be cared
f i-or piovided for The cci -,ti ulion has declared
that CongiPs«i shut have power to tcgulatp commerce
h tween the St tes Co^ ¡ess h s alwa)s heieto-
forerrade such provisions, or attempted it, fj estab-
lishing wh t his been deemed a sound c> rrencv,
and with it, and dependent upon >t iheal hful sj s-
te n of domestic exchanges The cninons of ell
o ir statesmen, of all parties, from ihe foundation of
tne Government down to the present dyn istv, hue
o mcided upi n this subject And yet, we ->re now
told that the Government m ght s well be called
upon to convey the merchíind se¡ f its citi7 ns from
one point to another, as to regulate their intra 1]
commeice Such are the ab urditi"s to which wc
-re reduced bv a spmt of theoiizmg an 1 1 f ndness
for experiments In suppoit of these no/el and
unhearl of n tions, the example of the States of
Europe is referred to and tlvir us""fs are mar-
shalled befbic us against an pxprpss provision orour
constitution, and the unbroken practice of ihe Gov-
ernment and country Sir, who and wt it are we
that we are thus called upe n to abandon all oar ex-
pel ience,evei vie son of our history and to lav onr-
veh es down at the feet of th° monopolists and auto-
crats of Europe 1   Wc  diffs-r from the whole of

them, individually and collectively, and I desire to
thank God that we do so We stand upon the solid
platform of free institutions, w e live only m the free
hope that is given to labor, and industry, and com-
petition We aie a confederacy of sovereign and
independent States—many in number—and differ-
ing in our local institutions, arrangements, and usa-
ges And are we to be referred to the single and
consolidated arm of power m the States of Europe
for business example and currency precedents 1 It
is this peculiarity in our political fabric which led
the statesmen of the revolution to make the provi-
sion in the constitution to which I have advened ,
it is the same peculiarity, distinguishing us from alt
other States, which has led all our statesmen until
now to conform to the wise forethought of those
sages and patriots
Sir, I will not trouble jou by recurring to the
opinion  of the older statesmen I will only refresh
your íecol'ection by adverting to some of more re-
cent date—to opinions that have been uttered within
the last four years What does Mi Taney say m
one of his íeports concerning tne State or deposite
banks'? This 1  his language " They are provid-
ing a general currency at least as sound as that of the
United States Bank, an 1 will afford facilities to
commeice and in the business of domestic exchange,
quite equal to any which thecommunity heretofore
enjoj ed " Again, he uses strong language-v-lan-
guage free from all doubt—when he declares of the
same banks that " they are competent to perform
all the services which the Govei nment ought to re-
quire, and to afford all the facilities to the infernal
commerce and exchanges rf the country, which have
been claimed from the Bank of the United States "
I offer but one opinion more—that of the late
President Jackson in that celebrated paper which
was " read to the cabinet " Who will doubt the
meaniHg of this passage—" It should also be en-
joined upon any banks which maybe empkryed,
that it will be expected of them to facilitate domestic
exchanges for the benefit of inieraaf commcrci'i"
These are excellent opinions, but they were
most unfortunately applied, as our sad experience
every day is shon mg us They indicate the firm
convictions of those who utteied them, and they
correspond with all the opinions of past time upon
the subject until now Sir, the business of this
great country cannot be carried on—it is monstrous
to suppose it can be—w ithont a sound general cur-
rency and a well regalated system of domestic ex-
chmges These are indispensable They are
equal y necessary to the man of laige business and
to the man of limited operations Remittances are
made by every class and almost by eveiy individu-
al in the eommunitj How can they be made
without a general and univeisally accredited cur-
rency'? I declare to vou, then, my unshaken con-
viction th it the people will not countuianc the
system vou propose 111 this bill They will not
consent to be cut off from these indispensable re-
quisites of "ood business and healthful prosperity.
They will no suffer their best interests to be sacri-
ficed m order to gratify jour unmanly attachment
to impracticable experiments They will demand
ol you t cy are already demanding of you, thai
vou retrace }our s.teps
All Chairman, before concluding, I feel bound
to 1 oticc some remaik  which fell ftom the mem-
ber from South Caí olma, (M' Pickens,) who opened
mis de ue That gentleman thought proper to
make an attack upon northern labor, and, by way
of retaliation upen " .[Northern \bolitiomsm," pro-
claims 1 is intention to " retort the pieachmg of wi-
suuectlon," and the text which he lakes is "the
universal emancipation of northern labor from
ne rthern fraud and duplicity " He represents the
banks and corporations of the north as engaged ifi
" enslaving and subjecting the laboring class " And
he, a slaveholder proposes to erect the standard e*
msui reuion, and to draw the-eto the laborers 0
the north
Does that gentleman understand what is mean
by the labor of the north ■? Does he deem it an m
strumrnt which he-can wield to carry out his pur
poses of sedition and insurrection 1 Let me tel
the gentleman that the laboring classes of th
north comprise the whole population of thp north
The great rule of existence there is labor, and onk
