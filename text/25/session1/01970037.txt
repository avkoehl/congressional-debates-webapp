shape, to prevent the disturbances of the i-ompro
mise, which is gradually removing the last ve«tige
of the tariff sybtem, and rmmly, I shall use my
best efforts to give an ascendancy to the great
conservative principle of Stafe sovereignty, over
the dangerous and despotic docti me of consolida-
tion I rejoice to think that the Executive De
partnienl of the Government is now so i educed m
' powei and means, that it ca ,. no longer rely on its
influence and pationage to secure a majority
Hencefoiwaid it can nove no hope of supporting
itself but on wisdom, modeiafion, patriotism and
devoted attachment to the Constitution, which I
trust will make it, in its own defence, an ally in
effecting the reform which I deem indispensable to
the salvation of the country and its institutions
I look, sir, with pride to the wi«e and noble beai-
mg of the little State rights party, ol which it is my
pride to be a member, throughout the eventful
period through which the country has passed since
1824 Experience already bears testimony to their
patriotism, firmness, and sagacity, and history will
do it justice In that year, as 1 have stated, the
tariff system triumphed in the councils oí the nation
We saw its disastious political bearings—foresaw
its surpluses and the extravagances to which it
would lead We rallied on the election of the late
President to arrest it through the influence of the
Executive D^paiiment of the Government In this
we failed We then fell back upon the lights and
sovereignty of the States and by the action oí a
small 1>ut gallant State, and thiough the potency of
its interposition, we brought the sjstem to tne
ground, sustained, as it was, by the opposition and
the administration, and by the whole powei and
patronage of the Government The pernicious
overflow of the Treasurv, of which it v\as the
parent, could not be arrested at once The surplus
was seized on b\ the Executive, and, bj its control
over the banks became the fruitful source of Exe-
cutive influence and encroachment Without hesi
tauon, we joined our old opponents on the tariff
question, but under our own flag and without merg-
ing in. their ranks, and made a gallant and success-
ful war against the encroachments of the Executive
That terminated, we part with our late allies in
peace, and move forward, lag or onward who may,
to secuie the fruits of our long but successful strug-
gle, under the old republican flag of '98, which,
though tattered and torn, has ne\ er yet been lower-
ed, and, wi*h the blessing of God, nevei shall be
with my consent
SPEECH OF MR. JONES,
Of Virginia,
JH the House -o/ Rep esenlatives^ Wednesday, Septem-
ber 20, 1837—On th? bill to postpone the fourth
instalment of deposite with the States
Mr Chairman In submitt ng foi the considera-
tion, of the Committee the views which I propose to
present, it is not my intention to enter upon the
wide field of discussion to which the remarks of
other gentlemen would seem to invite me, bul to
confine myself to the subject intended to be em-
braced by the bill now under consideration This
I piopose to do, because the very wide range of
debate winch has been indulged in by honorable
members who have preceded me, seems to have for
its object the investigation of subjects which appear
to me to have no connection whalevci with the one
now undei consideration, and is not, therefore,
likely to aid in the accomplishment ol the great ob-
ject winch I have m v lew, which is, to ascertain
the real condition of the finances of the Govern-
ment, and thus to put it m the power of the repre-
sentatives of the people understanding^ to act
upon the veiy important and delicate subject which
has for several days called forth the most anvious
deliberation ot Congress This bill h-> s for its ob-
ject, at present, to withhold from the States the
fourth instalment of the surplus rev enue which was
directed by the deposite act of the 23d of June,
1836, to be passed over to the States, to be lr-ld by
them on deposite, upon the terms and condmons
specified m that act, and the question arises whethei
the existing state oí tilings m refeience to th  finan-
cial condition of the Treasury, renders such a mea-
sure necessary on the part of the Government, and
if necessary, whether Congress can rightfully exei-
eise the power  to  control  that instalment in the
way proposed by the bill, and w ith a view to a cor-
rect understanding of the subject in all its beanngs,
it may not be amiss now veiy briefly to advert to
the condition of the Treasury at the time of the
passage of the deposite pet, and to what was likely
to be its condition at the close of the present year
In the month of June, 1836, it had been distinctly
aseerta ned, that at the close of that } ear there
would be m the Treasury near forty millions of
dolíais of surplus íevenue, over and above wnat
would be required for the legitimate wants of the
Government, and the accruing revenue for the pre-
sent year was regaided by all as abundantly suffi-
cient to meet eveiy demand upon the Tieasury
d nvn to the close of the year
Tins surplus, it would be recollected, had not
been produced bj legislation which hid for its
object the accumulation of so large an amount, but
by causes which have had then due influence in
bringing about mat general state of embarrassment
wb ch it has be6n al'eged now extended itself over
the whole country Into an examination of these
causes, it is not mv intention now to entpr, but it
is notorious that, in the face of predictions again and
again sent forth to the world (rem this Capitol, tnat
we should have an empty Treasury and a bank-
rupt Government, at the time referred to neirlv
forty millions of dollars of surplus had accumu-
lated m the Tieasury in the form ol revenue'
There it was, and the question was, what was to
be done with if To permit it to remain in the
deposite banks wa  not only to hazard the loss of a
very large portion of it, but the banks using it as
so much banking capital, on which to extend their
issues, loans and discounts, were, by means of these
issues, loa"S, and Uscount , íeceiving from it the
most mordmatp promts to b div ided < mong the
stockholders, and, i the sime time, sv olhpq tne
flood of depreciated paper mom,) w i which the
country has been deluged, and thus contributing, as
much, perhaps, as any other single cause, to pro-
duce that wide-spread embarrassment which has
swept over the whole land It was not, therefoie,
either safe or prudent to permit it to remain on
deposite with the banks
To loan it to the States was to place it beyond
the reach and control of the Geneial Government,
to which it rightfully belonged, since the Constitu-
tion has, in my opinion, w ísely omitted to provide
any tubunal, at whose bar one of the sovereign
States of this Union can be arraigned to answer for
an alleged violation of its contiact with the Gene-
ral Government, and to give it to the States was
at once to establish a precedent, fraught alike with
mischief and with danger
These are some of the difficulties, on every hand
presenung themselves, when it became the duty oí
Congress to act upon the subject of the surplus re-
venue It was in view of these difficulties that the
deposite act of June, 1836 had received the sanc-
tion of Congress That ait meiely provided for
thedepooite of the surplus íevenue with the States,
w ithout interest, thus giving to the States the use
ot the money, with mt charge, until the necessities
of the Geneial Government should lender necessa-
ry its return, either in part or in whole, and for its
punctual return, whenever the necessity should
arise, the faith of the States should be solemnly
pledged
We have, then, Mi Chairman, the question pre-
sented, whether the existing state of thing in refer-
ence to the financial condition of the Treasury,
renders it necessary to withhold the fouith instal-
ment in the wa> proposed oy the bill now under
cons deration
I am avvaie, sir, that the examination of this
branch of the subject renders necessary a íesort to
details which will piobably be uninteresting to the
committee, but the subject is complex in its na-
ture—so much so, that we have heard it again
and again repeated by gentlem-n m debate, that
such was the confusion and obscuntv thrown
over it by tot repoit of the Secietaiy of the
Treasury, that they could find no d ita leading
to conclusions which enabled them to detei • re,
in their own minds, what would be the actual con-
dition of the Tieasury at the close of ths present
i ear As a member of the committee from which
this bill has been reported, it became my duty to
give to the report of the Secretary an attentive and
patient examination, which has resulted in a con-
's ictioii upon my own mind that maht, if nc t
all of the difficulties which seem to he in me way
of gentlemen, may very readily be removed by a.
like attentive an i patient mve tigation oh tljeir
part It In-- also satined me that the means- at
the control of the Secretary are not only insufficient
to meet the existirg demands upon tl - Tieasury,
but that thero will be at the doS" of the present
) ear a deficiency of several millions of aolfars
This I think I shall be able to make manifesto the
commi tee from the íeport of the Secretar). fe r it
is npin that document, confused and ooscure as
some gentlemen lepres^nt it to be, that 1 shall base
the whole of mv itasoning
The Secretary is in officer of the Government,
selected to fill that high station, not onl> on ac-
count of his moral virtues, but because of a lepula-
tiou which he has earned in the service of his coun-
try, and which has justly secured to him i large
shaie of public confidence I, sir, mi content to
take the official statement of such a man, at least
until prooi, clear and convincing, shall be adduced
that he has cried, then, but not till thni, will I
consent to throw discredit upon his official conduct
I beg leave then, sir, for a moment, to call the at-
tention of the committee to a short statement I
have prepared, and which presents fairly, and, I
think, clearly, the liabilities of the Govarnment,
with its means of meeting them, and which can
scarcely f<fil to satisfy every candid and unbiassed
mind that its means of payment are not equal to its
hab lilies by more than si x millions of dollars, after
cxc'udmgfrom the estimate fifteen millions of dol-
lars o1" unexp 'ded appiopi lain ns, postponed to the
