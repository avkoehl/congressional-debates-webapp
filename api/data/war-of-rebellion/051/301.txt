HEADQUARTERS, ETC.,Near Morgan's, September 10, 1863-8 p.m.

Lieutenant General D. H. HILL,

Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: I send Major Nocquet, of General Buckner's staff to confer with you as to our operations. He understands the situation here as fully as I do. The question which I am trying to solve to-night is: What force of the enemy is at or about Steven's Gap to attack me in rear while co-operating with you? Probably the greater part of that force would be drawn toward Dug Gap at the sound of your artillery, thus enabling me to move by way of Davis' Cross-Roads without too great risk. Can you at an early hour to-morrow make a real attack on the head of the enemy's column, so as to induce him to mass his forces while I strike him in rear? In this connection, can you force your way through them and effect a junction with me about Davis' Cross-Roads, while I force my column tot he same point? Please answer these questions specifically. It may be that the enemy is in such force at Steven's Gap that I may find it imprudent to expose my rear to their attacks.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. C. HINDMAN,

Major-General.
