Forts Sumter and Moultrie, principally from first works to half way across. You will also, as soon as practicable, place additional torpedoes in Hog Island Channel, toward Sullivan's Island Point; in Folly Island Channel, and in the middle channel east of Pinckney.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHARLESTON, S. C.,

August 31, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have the honor to inform the Department that the hand grenades, described in the enemy's prints as so terrible in repelling their assault upon Battery Wagner, were subtler shells. There were none of the former at that post, and, consequently, none were used.

Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

G. J. RAINS,

Brigadier-General, on Special Duty.

[Indorsements.]

SEPTEMBER 3, 1863.

Respectfully submitted, for the information of the President.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

Acknowledge, with gratification, the success of General Rains' saburra shells, and return this letter to Secretary of War.
