Assistant Adjutant-General
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, S. C., February 14, 1865

Brigadier General JOHN P. HATCH,

Pocotaligo, S. C.,:

Your letter of the 12th and telegrams of the 12th and 13th instant are received. General Prince's command will get their arms to-day. He is short of officers and has no transportation. You can probably get 1,000 or 1,200 men from him to-morrow morning. Take all that can be of service. General Sherman's orders of the 7th are for you to push forward to the Edisto. I do not think any enemy will remain on your right flank as you advance. I will ask the admiral to feel up the Ashepoo and Edisto.

Q. A. GILLMORE.

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SAVANNAH,Savannah, Ga., February 14, 1865.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Headquarters Department of the South:

I have just received the order to hold 1,000 men in readiness for detached service. In reply I have to state that I have but 3,910 enlisted men present for duty. Of that number 1,900 are necessary for duty in the town for the safety of public property and the city. With the remaining 2,000 I have to guard a line five miles in length and furnish all details, which are at this post very heavy. I therefore cannot, consistently with the safety of this city and the public property here, spare the force ordered. If desired I can make a full explanation of all the duties required here, which will strengthen the foregoing statement. I consider it my duty, therefore, as the commanding officer of the district and post, and therefore responsible for its safety, respectfully but earnestly to protest against the taking away of any force, at least at present.
