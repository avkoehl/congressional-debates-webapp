HEADQUARTERS HOOD'S CORPS,May 27, 1864-9.50 a. m.

Major-General CLEBURNE,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: I am directed by Lieutenant-General Hood to say to you that, if you think it best, you can withdraw General Govan's brigade, leaving a heavy line of skirmishers on the line now occupied by them, provided the movement can be made without attaching special attention from the enemy.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. HAMILTON,

Aide-de-Camp.

P. S.-General Hood repulsed the attack made upon him with great ease. He thinks the attack was by Howard. His second line was not brought into action at all.

Respectfully,

T. B. ROY.

This you will perceive is a weak line, and if it could be remedied it should be done by some reserves.

Yours, truly,

S. G. FRENCH,

Major-General.
