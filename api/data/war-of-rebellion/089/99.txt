that a force, consisting of Law's, Benning's, and Gregg's brigades, passed Thorne's this evening, going north, toward the York River road indicating a reconnaissance in my front. I send a note to General Butler about it, which please forward. I think it would be well to forward the refugees to General Butler at once.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,
