tented with eighteen? Must they insist upoa issuing
four dollars, or even five, upon one, so as to draw
twenty-four or thirty per cent and thus, af'er pay-
ing their officers vast salaries, and accommodating
friends ivith loans on easy terms, still make
enough out of the business community to cover all
expenses and all losses, and then to divide larger
profits than can be made at any other business'
Mr B complimented the iate General Assembly
of Louisiana in having incorporated into an act
the English proportion of one third specie for the
circulation and deposites combined, and also for
having adopted the important provision of a limi-
tation on the denomination of notes toa minimum
of twenty dollars He made no remark upon the
general character of the bill which contained these
provisions, and which had not ripened into a law
He only spoke of the two provisions mentioned,
any thing fuither would be impioper, and he men
tioned these provisions as setting an example
•nhich it would be good for the Congress of the
Tinned States, and for every State in the Union, to
follow
We now touch a point, sai 1 Mr B vital to the
safety of banking, and I hope it «ill neither be
passe 1 over without decision, nor decided in an er-
roneous manner We had up the same question
two years ago in the discussion of the bill to regu-
laf th" keeping ot the public moneys by the local
deposite banks A Senator from Massachusetts
[Mr Webster] moved the question, he (Mr B )
coidially concurred in it, and the proportion of
one fourth was then inserted He (Mr B) had not
seen at that time the testimony ot the Governor and
Directors oí the Bank of England, fixing on the one
third as the proper proportion, and he presumed
that the Senntor from Massachusetts [Mr W ] had
not then seen it, as on another occas on he quoted
it wit i approbation, and stated it to be the propor-
tion observed at the Bank of the United States.
The proportion of one fourth was then inserted in
the deposite bill, it was an erroneous proportion,
but even that proportion was not allowed to stand.
Af er having been inserted in the bill, it was struck
out, and it « as left to the discretion ot the Secreta-
ry of the Treasury to fix the proportion To this
I then objected, and gave my reasons for it I
was for fixing the proportion, because I held it vital
to the sifety of the deposite banus, I was against
leaving it to the Secretar} , because it «as a case
in which the inflexible rule of law, and not the
variable dictate of individual discretion shou'd be
exeici>-ed, and because I was certain that no Secre-
tary could be relied upon to compel the banks to
toe the mark, when Congress itself had flinched
from the task of making thena do it My
objections were unavailing The proportion was
struck out of the bill, the discretion of the Secre-
tary to fix it vas substituted, and that d scretion it
was impo sible lo^xercise with any effect over the
banks They were, that is to --a many of them,
were far beyond the mark then, >"a at tbr time of
the issuing of the Treasury order 'n Julv, 1836,
there were deposite banks, whose proportion of
specie in hand to their immediate liabilities were
as one to twenty, one to thirty, one to forty,
and even one to fifty1 The explosion of all such
banks was inevitable The issuing of the Trea-
sur} "order improved them a little, they began to in-
crease their specie, and to diminish their liabilities,
but the sap was too wide, the chasm was too vast
to be filled, and at the touch of pressure, a'l these
banks fell like nine-pins' They tumbled down m
a heap, and lay there, without the power of mo-
tion, or scarcely of breathing. Such was the con-
sequence ot our erroi in omitting to fix the proper
proportion of specie in hand to the liabilities of
our deposite banks let us avo d that etror in the
bill now before us True we a-e now legislating
not for the whole Union, but for a District of ten
miles square Our legislation is confined to a nar-
row A strict, but our example spretds over the wide
Union That example, for good or fir evil, will
have Us influence, and let us endeavoi to se* some
good examples m the provisions of these charters,
let us endeavor to lessen the dangers, and to in-
crease the sifety of banking, and, for hat purpose,
to require them to keep specie on hand to the
amount of the one third of their circulation and de-

latter provision effective it would be necessary to
banish all notes under twenty dollars from the

TREASURY NOTE BILL.
^____________               H. of Reps.
" emit bills of credit," but the power " to borrow
money" given, without any limitation &t restricted
as to the manner or form in which it shall be done.
What is the meaning of borrowing money? Is it not
getting money on your credit? The shape in which
you put out your credit or promise to pay is per-
fectly immaterial I hold in my hand a Treasttry
note, and a certificate of stock To " borrow mo-
ney" in the latter form, gentlemen say, is constitu-
tional, in the former not. The Treasury note is a
promise on the part of the United States to pay to
B or his order a certain sum, one year from date,
with sw per cent interest; the certificate of stock
is a due bill, certifying that a certain sum is due
by the United Slates to B, or his assigns, one year
afterdate, bearing fi/eper cent interest. Now,
sir, what is the difference between theve two methods
of borrowing money? Both are promises to pay,
one year after date, at nearly the same rate of in-
terest. Both are transferrable—the one by endorsement
—the other by assignment, which maybe in blank,
and thus afford the same facilities for passing from
hand to hand There is, in fact, but one material
difference between the 'wo forms of loan, and that
does noi appear upon die face of either The Treasury
note may be recen ed, according to a clause in the
October law, in pay ment of public dues, and thus
be redeemed before the expiration of the year.
Yet even thu. peculiarity in these notes, is not un-
common in the issue of stock, which is often made
redeemable at the will of the Government But can
the time or manner of redeeming the loan, in the
least degree, affect the constitutional power of ma-
king ill If so, then the constitutionality of the
form, depends upon the greater or less convenience
of redeeming the loan If the method is prompt
and easy, as is provided with respect to these Trea-
sury notes, it is unconstitutional, I suppose, if it
is postponed, and íendered difficult, then it is con-
stitutional Nor can the interest to be paid, at all
affect the constitutionality of the issue If you have
the power to "boirow mone)," it is your duty to
thejpeople, who must ultimately pay the debt by
the sweat of their brows, to borrow it upon the
cheapest terms possible If from the abundance of
capital, and the superior credit of the Government,
and the uses to which this credit may be applied,
you can borrow money at two or three per cent, in-
terest, or at no interest at all, it is your duty to
do it The only question is, do you want money,
and do ) ou design to borrow it' The Constitu-
tion leaves the method absolutely at your own dis-
cretion and control
My colleague has quoted the case of Craig vs
the S ate of Missouri, by which it has been deter-
m ned by Ihe Supreme Court of the United States,
that a State cinnot emit a bill of credit. Now,
sir, suppose that there was m the Constitution, an
express prombition (which there is not) to the Uni-
ted State> em tt ng bil s of credit, as there is to the
S ates, this case would not at all affect the measure
before you? In that case, Chief Justice Marshall,
in delivering the opinion of the court, (every Re-
publican Judge upon the bench dissenting,! put the
dec sioi unon the fact, that the certificates of the
State of Missouri were designed to be the cur-
rency of tne country, and a substitute for the con-
stitutional currency of gold and siher Is that the
case heie? The Treasury notes authorized by the
bill on jour table are limited to the amount of
§18 000 (JGO None can be ,ssued after the first
dav ot December next, when thev are all redeem-
ab e, and when received into the Treasury cannot
beieissned Do these features show any design
of furnishing a currency to the couitrj, as a sub-
stitute for the constitutional currency, and make
th°se notes "bills of credit," in the meaning of the
Constitution1* The word "em t," sa>s the Judge,

SPEECH OF MR. RHETT,
Or South Carolina,
In the House of R'pretentatives, May 13, 1838—On
the Treasury note bill
Mr Chairman It is not my mtent.on, on the
present occasion to discuss at length, the various
subjects embraced by the remarks of my honora-
ble friend and colleague, [Mr Thompson,] who
has just taken his seat When the Independent
Treasury bill comes up for consideration, I may
take an opportunity to controvert many of the posi-
tions he has assumed, with respect to this great con-
servative measure, but, at present, I shall confine
myself chiefly to the subject strictly before the com-
mittee—the authorizing a reissue of Treasury notes,
in the place of those which have been returned
into the Treasury in the payment of public dues,
before the period contemplated for their redemp
tion by the act of October last To jud«;e oC the
propriety of this measure, it is necessary to look to
the state of the Treasury In a communication
addressed to the House a few days since on this
subject, by the President of the United States, it
is stated, that there are in the Treasury, of available
means, in ro'ind number , but $216 000, and in the
Mint, but $347,000 Demands to a large amount
are suspended in the departments, waiting for pay-
ment from the means to be provided by Congress
and the present means tí ill carry the Government
but afew da)«longer,when,if not provided with them,
it must stop. Of unavailable means, the resources
are abundant. Twenty-eight millions are on de-
posite with the States Fifteen millions more are
due from the banks and individuals—one-half of
which will come in with the next sir months
The necessity of the Treasury is an immediate,
present necessity, not extending (unless increased
by your legislation) beyond the next four or six
months, and limited chiefly to the next two or three
mon hs This, sir, is the nature of the necessity,
and this the state of the Treasur} The embarrass-
ment is accidental and temporary, occasioned by
the legislation of Congress for the relief of the
banks, by which the means in the Treasury have
been postponed, and the premature return of the
notes authorized to be issued by the October law,
before the period of their redemption The reme-
dy proposed by the bill under consideration, is this,
to authorize other notes to be issued, as the emer-
gencies of the Treasury shall require, in the place
of those which ha\e been returned into the Trea-
sury, before the period contemplated for their re-
demption—net exceeding the limits imposed bj the
act of O tober, as to the amount and time of issue
The relief will be immediate, and will create the
debt only when necessary, ana to the amount ne-
cessary
To this bill there are various objections urged, but
nearly all of them are but iterations of those which
were pressed at the extra session, against the
. original bill, to whicls this may be considered an
amendment They were then answered but be-
ing of such a nature, I suppose, in the opinion 
of those who ¿resented them, as to require tepeti-
tion to ensure recoliestion—they are brought for-
ward again, and to aid this very commendible de-
sign, it may not be improper, again, brieflj to notice
them
First then Treasury notes are unconstitu am1,
because they are bills of ciedit, and this Govern-
ment has no right to issue bills of credit
Mr Chairman lam a State Rights ma i lam
disposed to regard wt h great jealousy every power
exercised by this Government, and to require, ux
? very case, that it shall b" shown, either by express
grant, or bj nesessa^v mplieation, that the power
cla me J is clearly given b\ the Constitution Now,
sir, the Government wants to borrow mone), for
some four or six months I turn to the Constitu-
tion, and find no prohibition to this Government to
