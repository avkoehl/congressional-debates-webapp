Brigadier-General SANBORN,

Commanding, Springfield:

GENERAL: The enemy has 300 men, of Brown's and Palmer's command, about Cane Hill and Rhea's Mills. Adair and Stand Watie are reported, with 325 men, west of Bentonville. Pickler is said to be near Cincinnati, with probably 75 men. Raleigh and Scrugs are cutting wire about Cross Hollow, with about 30 men each.

I have a dismounted squadron there to waylay them. Pleasanton had about 150 men not long ago east of War Eagle. About 100 men are robbing the country near Huntsville. Captain King attacked them a few days ago; wounded 2, drowned 2 in the river, and took 8 prisoners. One of Adair's spies came in yesterday; was followed in by Lieutenant Rowe. He had a good horse, shotgun, 3 revolvers; left them all near town before he came in. He was killed near one of my pickets at 10 last night. I learn Major Cosgrove is to be at Bentonville to-day. Please let me know as I wish to make a diversion toward Cane Hill in his favor.
