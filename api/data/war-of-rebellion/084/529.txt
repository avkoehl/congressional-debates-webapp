Major General JOHN POPE,

Commanding Department of the Northwest, Milwaukee, Wis.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 1st instant, and in reply to say that, in my opinion, military aid will be necessary in this State to enforce peacefully the draft ordered to be commenced on the 5th proximo. Four companies will doubtless be necessary at Milwaukee, as there is more apprehension of disturbances at that point than any other in the State. Two commissioned officers and about thirty enlisted men, it is believed, will be sufficient to insure order at each of the provost-marshals' headquarters at Janesville, Prairie du Chien, Fond du Lac, Green Bay, and La Crosse.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
