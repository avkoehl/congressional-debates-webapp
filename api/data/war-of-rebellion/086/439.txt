Major-General HALLECK:

Your dispatch of this date received. There are no troops at Cape Girardeau, save one or two companies of Missouri State Militia. I will learn if there are any at Cairo, and if there are will send them as you direct. The Sixty-first Regiment Illinois Volunteers left here to-day on steamer for Springfield, Ill., via Alton. It numbers about 265 veterans. I have sent order to it, which will reach it at Alton, to proceed immediately to Paducah, Ky. this regiment was at home on veteran furlough, and on the expiration of its furlough was sent from Springfield here to Rosecrans by General H. E. Paine and was being returned. I did not know of it until this evening, or I should have sent it from here direct. Orders have been sent General McNeil, who succeeds General Sanborn in command of the forces pursuing Price by Rosecrans, in accordance with the letter and spirit of General Grant's dispatch of date of the 4th instant. He has been directed to report to and receive orders from General Curtis. Please forward copy to General Grant.
