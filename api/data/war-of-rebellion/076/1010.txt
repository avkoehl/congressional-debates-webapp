ATLANTA, August 31, 1864--12.35 p. m.

POST COMMANDER,

Jonesborough:

There is said to be a train of cars at Rough and Ready. If must be moved down the road; it has no engine. Take measures to get it down; be careful, however. Colonel McMicken has started down the road on engine.

HEADQUARTERS SEARS' BRIGADE,August 31, 1864.

Major D. W. SANDERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: The report rendered regarding the strength of the enemy in our front has been greatly exaggerated. It was brought in by our cavalry scouts. Not more than ten of the enemy were seen in one body. The report about their deploying was not sustained. It amounts to a few cavalry scouts. We have extended our line to the right, connecting with the militia, so that we now cover the whole of General Walthall's front. I sent a staff officer to our right. He has just come in; reports our scouts in front as having lost sight of the enemy. The report of having killed a man was incorrect; his horse fell, and evidence of blood shows that horse or man was badly wounded. On visiting the ground the men were a good deal disappointed in finding horse and man both gone.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. W. SEARS,

Brigadier-General.

AUGUST 31, 1864.

Major-General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry:

Sherman faces Atlanta from the west, crossing the Chattahoochee at Sandtown. His wagon trains must be greatly exposed. General Hood thinks you had better move this way, destroying as you come, to operate upon them.
