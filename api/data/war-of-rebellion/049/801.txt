Send the Sixtieth Regiment Virginia Infantry to Wytheville without delay. I would like it to start at night so as to attract as little attention as possible. A force of cavalry with three pieces of artillery is moving from below Charleston on the Kanawha toward Logan Court-House; will probably strike at the railroad or salt-works.
