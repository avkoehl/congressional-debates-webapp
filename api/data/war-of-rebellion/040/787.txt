GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,

No. 60. May 8, 1863.

In consequence of the great number of desertions among the substitutes in this army, and since few men who are exempt from military duty by reason of their age, or from other cause, can be equal to the soldier who has been tried in the field, captains of companies and colonels of regiments will conform strictly to the orders of the War Department, and accept no substitute unless him normal, physical, and soldierly qualifications are clearly equal to those of the soldier for whom he is offered, and then only on the authority of the commanding general.

By order of General R. E. Lee:

R. H. CHILTON,

Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General.
