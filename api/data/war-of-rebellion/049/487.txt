HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS,November 25, [1863]-6 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I received your dispatch to examine the road at 3 p. m. The officers sent on that duty have just returned, and I forwarded their reports. * The main road is reported good, the side and cross roads not. In any low country I should fear for the condition of the roads.

Yours, very respectfully,

GEO. SYKES,

Major-General, Commanding.

HDQRS. ARTILLERY BRIGADE, FIFTH ARMY CORPS,November 25, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel FRED T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that I have examined the roads, as directed, in the direction of Richardsville, to within about 2 miles of that place. The road from the present camp, which was taken yesterday, is very soft and bad in many places, until we strike the Stevensburg road, after which the road was very good to within about 2 miles of Richardsville, and was reported by the cavalry to be in passable condition to the river. It would be very difficult moving the artillery from our present camp to the main road, which is about 3 miles, in the present condition of the ground.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. P. MARTIN,

Captain, Commanding Artillery Brigade.

The enemy were engaged in throwing up two small rifle-pits near Germanna Ford. They exhibit their usual watchfulness along the river. Their picket, both infantry and artillery, are relieved regularly at 9 a. m. daily.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

G. A. CUSTER,
