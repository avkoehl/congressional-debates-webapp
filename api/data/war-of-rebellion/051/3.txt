It is clearly proven that in proportion to its strength the crops of General Crittenden furnished as many men who fought throughout the battle as any other corps; that the officers and men behaved as well as any, and that the corps lost as many killed and wounded and fewer missing than any other corps. (See General Rosecrans' evidence, p.24.)
The testimony shows that General Crittenden's command was placed in reserve on the night of the 19th September; that his command was then composed of the two divisions commanded by General Van Cleve and Wood, General Rosecrans having notified General Crittenden that General Palmer would get his orders from General Thomas.

It is clear from the evidence that General Crittenden, on the 20th, was the last general officer to leave the field, and then only when there was no organized body of troops upon the field.

In the absence of charges he is at a loss to know to what points to direct explanations. Only three occur to him which could suggest themselves to any military man, and upon these he has some hesitation in commenting before a military court, explained as they are by the orders produced before this Court and by the testimony of so many officers of intelligence, including General Rosecrans.

1.In the report of General Rosecrans he speaks of the delay in relieving General Negley's command with the command of General Wood. This could not have been intended as a censure upon General Crittenden, for it is shown by General Rosecrans' evidence that his order was given directly to General Wood, and the fact afterward reported to General Crittenden. (See General Rosecrans' evidence, p.20, and also Captain Thomas', aide-de-camp, p.60.)
He will add, however, that the commanding general is mistaken in supposing if there was any delay in General Wood relieving General Negley in the line of battle that it was the cause of serious consequences later in the day, because General Wood did relieve General.
