General MEIGS

Yours of 16th received. Some of the suggestions had been acted on; all are timely. We must have some horses for our trains and cavalry. Relays will be necessary to maintain our position here. It will require a very great effort. The road will be heavily taxed, and all that can should come by land; our cavalry can escort them. Part of cavalry now near Decherd.
