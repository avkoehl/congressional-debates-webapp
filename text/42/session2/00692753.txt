MARY ANN MONTGOMERY.
Mr. BIRD, from the Committee on Invalid
Pensions, reported back, with a recommend-
ation that it pass, the bill (S. No. 955) grant-
ing a pension to Mary Ann Montgomery, widow
of William W. Montgomery, late a private in
Texas volunteers.
The bill directs the Secretary of the Interior
to place on the pension-roll the name of Mary
Ann Montgomery, widow of William W. Mont-
gomery, late a private in Texas volunteers,
and to pay her a pension from the passage of
this act as a private's widow, and in respect to
her minor children under sixteen years of
age.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I desire
to move an amendment to this bill, which I
think meets the concurrencc of the committee ;
and before doing-so I ask leave to make a short
statement.
Captain Montgomery was a Texas refugee.
He came to New Orleans and enlisted in a
regiment of Texas cavalry, of which Governor
Davis was colonel—a regiment which I was per-
mitted by the President of the United-States to
raise, appointing the officers provisionally.
Montgomery was appointed a captain, raised
his company, and went to Texas under such
commission. Commissions of that kind have
always been recognized by the War Depart-
ment. While in Texas as such captain and
exercising the command of captain, as I am
informed, he was killed in the line of his duty.
This bill from the Senate proposes to grant his
widow the pension of a private's widow, when
in point of fact he was a captain duly mustered
into the service of the United States. As the
pay-roll will show, he was paid as a captain,
and he exercised authority as such. His com-
mission was not signed by President Lincoln,
and ho could not have a commission from the
Governor of Texas because there was none.
This was an exceptional regiment. I move
to amend the bill by striking out the word
"private" wherever it occurs and inserting
"captain."
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill, as amended, was ordered to a third
reading; and it was accordingly read the third
time, and passed.
Mr. BIRD moved to reconsider the vote by
which the hill was passed; and also moved that
the motion to reconsider be laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I move
to amend the title of the bill just passed by
striking out "private" and inserting "cap-
tain."'
The amendment was agreed to.

late United States Army, to take effect from
and after the passage of this act.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time ; and being engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time, and passed.
