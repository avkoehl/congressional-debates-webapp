may come up which would take precedence of
the motion to go into a Committee of the Whole
House on the Private Calendar. It will be in the
power of a majority of the House, however, on
Monday to vote all other motions down, and re-
solve to go into a Committee of the Whole on the
Private Calendar.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. Cannot theHouse
on Monday agree to a motion to discharge the
committee from the further consideration of such
Of the bills as have been ordered to be reported to
the House ?
The SPEAKER. If not objected to, it can be
done.
-Mr. JONES. And if it be objected to ?
The SPEAKER. If objected to, two thirds of
the members pfesent can order it.
Mr. JONES. Can order the committee to be
discharged from the further consideration of these
bills, and to brine them into the House
The SPEAKER. No doubt of it.
Mr. HOUSTON. But there is already a mo-
tion pending to suspend the rules on Monday.
Mr. JONES. That will.not conlume all the
day.
Mr. HOUSTON. There is no foretelling how
long it may take.
Mr. FLORENCE. It may take all day.
Mr. JONES. What is the motion to suspend
the rules for?
Mr. FLORENCE. For the purpose of con-
sidering Mr. Cobb's suggestion about graduating
the public lands, or some such thing.
Mr. JONES. Mr. Cobb can withdraw that
motion till this matter is disposed of.
[Cries of " Question !" " CLuestion !"]
The SPEAKER. The question is on the mo-
tion submitted by the gentleman from Virginia,
[Mr. McMullin,] to dispense with all further
proceedings under the call.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I would like,
before voting on that motion, to ask a question
from the Chair. 1 want myself to see these pri-
vate bills passed, but before voting on the ques-
tion to dispense with all further proceedings under
the call, I want to know if a majority of the
House can, on Monday next, proceed to the con-
sideration of these bills ?
Mr. ABERCROMB1E. They can do so if no
objection be made.
Mr. WASHBURNE. Of course they can;
but I want to know whether they can do so even
though objection be mode ? 1 want to know
whether it is within the control of a majority of
the House ?
The SPEAKER. If the gentlemen will allow
the Chair, he will state that then; is a motion
pending to suspend the rules, holding over from
Monday last, and that will be the first business in
order next Monday.
Mr. COBB. I made the motion to suspend the
rules, to which the Speaker has referred, and it
necessarily comes up next Monday as the first
business in order. 1 would inquire of the Chair
if it would be competent for me to waive the right
then 
The SPEAKER, (interrupting.) By unani-
mous consent only.
Mr. COBB. I will be perfectly willing to with-,
draw the motion on Monday until the House has
taken action upon these bills, if it is competent to
do so,%nd I do not thereby lose my right to have
it considered afterwards.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Ala-
bama will have no control over his motion except
to withdraw it, or to have a vote of the House
upon it. It will be competent for the House after
disposing of that, and some other questions which
may arise taking precedence of the motion, to go
into a Committee of the Whole on the Private
Calendar; and they can go into the Committee of
the Whole House by a majority vote.
Mr. McNAlR. Can that report be ordered to
be made by a majority ?
The SPEAKER. There is no doubt about it,
if there is a majority of the House present; if pot
they cannot.
Mr. HUGHES. There are seventy gentlemen
here, which is a sufficient guarantee, that a full
House will come to a sensible conclusion, in re-
gard to these private bills, without asking gentle-
men to remain here now to pass them. Trusting
and relying entirely upon the good sense of the
House, I shall vote for the proposition of the
gentleman from Virginia. I hope the House will
carry it out and now adjourn. I make that mo-
tion.
Mr. FLORENCE. I would say to the House
that messengers have been sent out to the resi-
dences of different members, and without doubt,
Awe will, in a few moments, have a quorum here.
^ The question was put on the motion to adjourn,
and twenty-eight members only voted in favor
thereof.
So the. House refused to adjourn
Mr. HENN. Is it in order to debate this mat-
ter?
The SPEAKER. It is not
Mr. HENN. 1 hope the House will not ex-
cuse any one who is brought in.
The Clerk then proceeded to call the absentees,
for the purpose of enabling excuses to be offered.
James C. Allen. No excuse offered.
"Willis Allen. No excuse offered.
Mr. TAYLOR, of Ohio, i would like to in-
quire of the Chair if there is any specific fine im-
posed upon gentlemen who are absent?

termined by the House itself. It is not regulated
by any existing law.
William S. Ashe. No excuse offered.

be present on account of severe illness.
Mr. McMULLIN. I move that he be excused.
The motion was agreed to.

league, Mr. Dunham, be excused. If he is not

[Laughter.] That is as good an excuse as has

to excuse Mr. Duniiam.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN. For the same reason
I move that my other colleague, Mr. Eddy, .be
excused.

tion. The rule requires the doors to be closed, but
not the windows. It is a very warm day, and yet
not only the doors but the windows are all closed.
