EIGHTEENTH CORPS, June 6, 1864-11.25 a.m.

Major-General MEADE:

Everything is quiet on my front except skirmish line. No attempt at progress was made last night in the direction of the enemy's works, on account of remarks made by you to Captain Farquhar yesterday. The picket officers and officers on my front line have reported the enemy hard at work during the last two nights digging, chopping, and driving stakes. I do not think an assault practicable from any point in my front, unless batteries are first thrown up on the front occupied yesterday morning by General Burnside, which might silence cross fire of artillery, which the enemy now have on me.

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General.
