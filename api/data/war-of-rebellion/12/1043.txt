And in this connection I would call the attention of the general coni- muanding to Private Thomas P. Clapp, of Captaimi Litchfields company (D), who, riding up to a Federal officer who was in advance of his men, engaged him in personal combat and killed him after being wounded himself; a deed well worthy of emulation. I have no one killed; 1 wounded, 1 missing. I cannot conclude this brief report without certifying to the highly Creditable manner in which both officers and men bore the danger and fatigue of a trip which has yet to be excelleda noble band of circuit- riders.
