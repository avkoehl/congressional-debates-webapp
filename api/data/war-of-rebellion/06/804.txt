thousand arms which Alabama promptly and cheerfully contributed and sent into distant States in the hands of her own volunteers for the common defense, and for further advising that, under the recent requisition of General A. S. Johnston, we have forwarded over two regiments of armed troops to Tennessee and Kentucky. We make no boast of these achievements; on the contrary, we profoundly regret that we had it not in our power to do far more than has been accomplished. While, however, the enemy is now seriously threatening our own soil, which has thus far been spared the pollution of his foot-print, and in view of our own destitution by reason of a surrender of arms for the defense of other prior exposed localities, I am sure you will most favorably consider the sincere and urgent appeal I here make. I have the means with which to procure additional arms and am making contracts for their manufacture within the State, but the emergency is now so pressing that we are unwilling to await the delays of delivery months hence, and have no other alternative but to appeal to your Department to afford us prompt and timely relief.

Awaiting I trust, your early and favorable response, I am, with high regard, your obedient servant,

JNO. GILL SHORTER.

MOBILE, January 9, 1862.

To His Excellency J. G. SHORTER,

Governor of Alabama:

SIR: I learn from Mr. Murrell, who derived his information from the master of a schooner recently from Havana, that there are 2,500 stand of arms at that place awaiting shipment to the Confederate States. They are the property of the Government, and might have reached this place before now by some of the schooners recently in this port from Havana. In the present condition of things here may it not be in your power to procure an order for said arms being shipped to Mobile for the use of troops here?

I respectfully suggest that a representation of the matter from you to the Secretary of War might secure these arms for this point.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. HAMILTON,

Chairman Executive Committee of Safety.
