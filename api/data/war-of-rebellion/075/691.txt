HEADQUARTERS JACKSON'S CAVALRY DIVISION,
Montevallo, May 10, 1864.

Major WILLIAM ELLIOTT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Demopolis, Ala.:

MAJOR: I find from actual inspection this morning eighty-three horses of Armstrong's brigade and sixty-three horses of Ross' brigade unable to travel with the command. I send them under an officer, Captain P. B. Wood, in the direction of Carthage to pasture and recruit. The officer is directed to report to you by letter as soon as he finds a suitable location. The dismounted men of Ross' brigade are ordered to Selma, and will leave on the train to-day. They will there report to the commandant of the post. They number sixty, and are under Lieutenant M. M. Scroggin, Company E, Ninth Texas Regiment. The dismounted men to Armstrong's brigade (number unknown) were left at Tuscaloosa, and on yesterday, by letter, were ordered to proceed to Selma.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. H. JACKSON,

Brigadier-General.
