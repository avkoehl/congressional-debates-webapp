AUGUSTA, GA., December 29, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant-General:

SIR: I inclose herewith a copy of an order* from General Longstreet relieving me from duty with the army under his command, together with a communication from the same headquarters assigning the "particular reasons for the issue of the order."

I have differed in opinion with General Longstreet concerning many things, but that this difference has influenced my own conduct or that of the troops under my command I utterly deny. I therefore respectfully request that my division be restored to my command.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully,

L. McLAWS,

Major-General.

DALTON, December 30, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Richmond:

Besides Morgan's troops, we have only 400 or 500 Kentucky cavalry.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

RICHMOND, December 30, 1863.

General J. E. JOHNSTON:

General Longstreet reports that he sent the cavalry of the Army of Tennessee back to that command on the 10th of December, 1863. His application to you for cavalry was not communicated to the War Department. Shoes have been sent to his command; whether that will remove his want of cavalry is not known.

JEFFN. DAVIS.
HEADQUARTERS HINDMAN'S CORPS, Dalton, Ga., December 30, 1863.

[Brigadier-General BATE,]

Commanding,&amp;.:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding desires you will inquire and report at once whether the punishment of the "wooden horse" is inflicted in an part of your command.

This and other methods of punishment having the character of torture will be immediately prohibited.

Whilst the major-general commanding does not oppose, but would rather enjoin those summary measures necessary to insure subjection to authority, care must be taken not to interfere with the proper province of the courts.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
