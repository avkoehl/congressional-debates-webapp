Raleigh, January 20, 1864.

Honorable ROBERT OULD, Commissioner of Exchange, Richmond:

MY DEAR SIR: Your long-promised letter in regard to transmitting funds to the North Carolina prisoners not having come to hand I inclose you herewith a letter to Governor Seymour, of New York, covering three bills of exchange on A. Collie &amp; Co., London--two for pounds 500 each, and one of pounds 200--which please transmit to its destination if practicable. Without your advice this was the best plan I could fix upon. Please have a receipt from the officer receiving it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Z. B. VANCE.

STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Raleigh, January 20, 1864.

His Excellency HORATIO SEYMOUR,

Governor of New York:

SIR: There are quite a number of soldiers of this State, prisoners of was in the United States, confined principally within your State. I learn that they are suffering greatly for want of winter clothing, and that the regulations of your Government do not forbid their purchasing if they had the means. Presuming upon your known humanity, I have ventured to inclose to you by flag of truce three sterling bills of exchange, drawn by Theo. Andrea upon Messers. A. Collie & Co., 17 Leadenhall street, London, amounting to pounds 1,200, which I desire you will have expended in the purchase of the most necessary clothing for the prisoners of war from north Carolina in whatever prison confined. I presume at the quoted rates of exchange the bills will produce nearly $9,000. In venturing to ask you to take so much trouble upon your hands I feel sure that the suggestion of humanity and the common courtesy existing between honest enemies will be a sufficient apology. I can but hope you will accept the trouble, and that you will not hesitate to allow me an opportunity of reciprocating your kindness should it become possible for me to do so.

I am, sir, with proper respect, your obedient servant,

Z. B. VANCE.

SIR: No further exchanges will be allowed. I have instructed Major D. J. Benner, aide-de-camp, to receive the two officers and forty-two privates mentioned in your last favor.

The excess in our favor can be settled for by the same officer and delivered hereafter.

Your obedient servant,
