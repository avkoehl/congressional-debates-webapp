TUNNEL, October 10, 1863-3.30 p.m.

Brigadier-General KNIPE,

Commanding, Cowan:

A rock has just been thrown down the tunnel as we passed through. I have sent a detachment of the Eleventh Corps up over the tunnel for temporary examination. Upon receipt of this order you will send a sufficient force to thoroughly clear the line of the shafts and all the country above and around the tunnel of any guerrillas or enemy. If you have not sufficient force apply to General Williams for more. There must be some of the enemy lurking in the woods. Lose no time in the execution of this order, and place a sufficient force to thoroughly, effectually, and efficiently guard the tunnel.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

The order for you to send a regiment to Battle Creek to relieve the Thirty-fourth Illinois Volunteers has been countermanded, therefore do not let it march. Five hundred of your men from the tunnel have returned by the cars, and the balance will be in to-night.
