Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
40th Cohg....2d Sess.
the negotiation of this loan and the straits to
which the Treasury was reduced, it will be
remembered by those who examined carefully
the monthly statements of the Department that
although during the month of April upward
of one hundred million dollars had been
received from the sale of seven-thirty notes,
the unpaid requisitions at it close had increased
to $120,470,000, while the cash (coin and cur-
rency) in all the public depositories amounted
to only $16,835,800. If few men intrusted
with the management of the finances of a great
nation were ever in a position so embarrassing
and trying as was that of the Secretary of the
United States Treasury in the months of April
and May, 1865, none certainly were ever so
happily and promptly relieved. The Secretary
refers to this period of his administration of
the Deportment with pleasure, because the suc-
cess of this loan was to him not only a sur-
prise and a relief, but because it indicated the
resources of the country and gave him the
needed courage for the performance of the
great work that was before him.
Between the 1st days of April and Septem-
ber, 18G5, the Secretary used his authority to
issue securities as follows:
Bonds under the act of February 25,
1862  St,023,GOO 00
Bonds under the act of J une 30,1S04, 0,000,000 00

$620,976,223 31
On the 31st of August, 1805, the public debt
reached the highest point, and was made up
of the following items, to wit:
Funded debt ยง1,109,568,191 80
Matured debt  1,503,020 00
Tomporary loans  107,148,713 16

Deduct cash in Treasury   . 88.218,055 13

Of these obligations, it will bo noticed,
$084,108,959 were a legal tender, to wit:
United States notes  $133,160,569 00
Five per cent, notes   33,954,230 00
Compound-interest notes  217,021,160 00
Total  5684,138,959 00
A very large portion of which are in circu-
lation as currency.
The temporary loans were payable in thirty
days from the time of deposit, after a notice
of ten days.
The five per cent, notes were payable in
lawful money, in one and two years from De-
cember 1, 18G3.
The compound-interest notes were payable
in three years from their respective dates, all
becoming due between the 10th day of June,
1807, and the lGth day of October, 1868.
1 he seven-thirty notes were payable, in
about equal proportions, in August, 18G7, and
.Tune and July, 1868, in lawful money, or con-
vertible _ at maturity, at the pleasure of the
holder, into five-twenty bonds.
The certificates of indebtedness would ma-
ture at various times between the 31st day of
August, 18G5, and the 2d day of May, 1807.
During the month of September, 1805, the
Army having been reduced nearly to a peace
footing, it became apparent that the internal
revenues and the receipts from customs would
he sufficient to pay all the expenses of the
Government and the interest on the public
debt, so that thenceforward the efforts of the
Secretary were to be turned from borrowing to
funding. Besides the United States notes in
circulation, there werenearly $1,300,000,000 of
debts in the form of interest-bearing notes,
temporary loans, and certificates of indebted-
ness, a portion of which were maturing daily,
and all of -which, with the exception of the
temporary loans, (which, being in the nature
of loans on call, might or might not be con-
tinued, according to tho will of the holders,)
must be converted into bonds or paid in money
before the 10th of October, 1868. The coun-
try had passed through a war unexampled in
its expensivness and sacrifice of lives; it was
afflicted with a redundant and depreciated cur-
rency ; prices of property and the cost of living
had advanced correspondingly with the increase
of the circulating medium; men, estimating
their means by a false standard of value, had
become reel;less and extravagant in their expen-
ditures and habits ; business, in the absence of
a staple basis, was unsteady and speculative,
and great financial troubles the usual result of
expensive wars, seemed to be almost inevitable.
It was under such circumstances that the
work of funding the rapidly maturing obliga-
tions of the Government and restoring the
specie standard was to be commenccd. While
the latter object could not be brought about
until the former bad been accomplished, it was
highly important that the necessity of an early
return to specie payments should never be lost
sight of. At the same time it seemed to the
Secretary that a return to the true measure of
value, however desirable, was not of sullicient
importance to justify the adoption of such
measures as might prevent funding, and inju-
riously affect those branches of industry from
which revenue was to be derived, much less
such measures as might, by exciting alarm,
precipitate the disaster which so many antici-
pated and feared. Thus the condition of the
country and the Treasury determined the pol-
icy of the Secretary, which has been to convert
the interest-bearing notes, temporary loans,
Ac., into gold-bearing bonds, and to contract,
the paper circulation by the redemption of
United States notes. For the last two years
this policy lias been steadily but, carefully pur-
sued, and the rcsutt upon the whole lias been
satisfactory to the Secretary, and, as he believes,
to a large majority of the people. Since the
1st day of September, 18G5, the temporary
loans, the certificates of indebtedness, and the
five per cent, notes have all been paid, (with
tho exception of small amounts of each not
presented for payment,) tho compound-inter-
est notes have been reduced from $217,024,100
to $71,875,040, ($11,500,000 having been taken
up with three per cent, certificates;) the seven
and three-tenth notes from $830,000,000 to
$337,978,800; the United States notes, includ-
ing fractional currency, from $459,505,311 51
to $387,871,477 39; while the cash in the
Treasury has been increased from ยง88,218,-
055 13 to $133,998,398 02, and the funded debt
has been increased $080,584,800. While this
has been accomplished there has been no com-
mercial crisis and (outside of the southern
States, which are still greatly suffering from the
effects of the war and the unsettled state of their
industrial interests and political affairs) no con-
siderable financial embarrassment.
In his last report the Secretary remarked
that "after a careful survey of the whole field
he was .of the opinion that specie payments
might be resumed, and ought to be resumed,
as early as the 1st day of July, 18G8, while he
indulged the hope that such would be the char-
acter of future legislation and such the condi-
tion of our productive industry that this most
desirable event might be brought about at a
still eailier day." These anticipations of the
Secretary may not be fully realized. The grain
crops of 1860 were barely sullicient for home
consumption. The expenses of the War De-
partment, by reason of Indian hostilities and
the establishment of military governments in
the southern States, have greatly exceeded
the estimates. The Government has been de-
frauded of a large part of the revenue upon
distilled spirits, and the condition of the South
has been disturbed and unsatisfactory. These
facts, and the apprehension created in Europe,
and to some extent at home, by the utterances
of some of our public men upon the subjects
of finance and taxation, that the public faith
might not be maintained, may postpone the
time when specie payments shall be resumed.
But, notwithstanding these unexpected embar-
rassments, much preliminai-y work_ has been
done, and there is not, in the opinion of the
Secretary, any insuperable difficulty in the way
of an early and a permanent restoration of the
specie standard. It may not be safe to fix the
exact time, but, with favorable crops next
year, and with no legislation unfavorable to
contraction at this session, it ought not to be
delayed beyond the 1st of January, or at the
furthest, the 1st of July, 18f>9. Nothing will
be gained, however, by a forced resumption.
When tho country is in a condition to maintain
specie payments they will be restored as a
nccessary consequencc. To such a condition
of national prosperity as will insure a perma-
nent restoration of the specie standard the
following measures are, in the opinion of the
Secretary, important, if not indispensable :
First. The funding or payment of the bal-
ance of interest-bearing notes, and a continued
contraction of the paper currency.
Heconil. The maintenance of the public faith
in regard to the funded debt.
Third. The restoration of the southern States
to their proper relations to the Federal Gov-
ernment.
If this opinion be correct the question of
permanent specie payments, involving, as it
does, the prosperity of the country, underlies
the great questions of currency, taxation, and
reconstruction, which are now engaging the
attention of the people, and cannot fail-to re-
ceive the earnest and deliberate attention of
Congress. In view of the paramount import-
ance of thisgreat question, the Secretary deems
it to be his duty briefly to discuss the measures
regarded by him to be necessary for an early
and wise disposition of it, even at the risk of
a repetition of what he has said in previous
communications to Congress.
The measures regarded by him as important,
if not indispensable for national prosperity,
and as a consequence for a permanent resump-
tion, are:
First. The funding or payment of the bal-
ance of interest-bearing notes, and a contin-
ued contraction of the paper currency.
By the act of March 2, 1867, the Secretary
was authorized and directed to issue three
per cent, loan certificates to the amount of
$50,000,000, for the purpose of redeeming and
retiring compound interest notes ; and such
certificates, on the 1st instant, had been issued
to the amount of $11,500,000, in redemption
of the notes becoming due in October and
December. The notes still outstanding will be
either^ taken up with certificates or paid at
maturity. The seven and three-tenth notes
being payable in lawful money or convertible
at the option of the holders into five-twenty
bonds will be paid or converted according to
the terms of the contract. Fortunately all the
interest-bearing notes are to be paid or eon-
verted within eleven months, and they need
not therefore be regarded as a serious impedi-
ment to a return to the true standard of value.
As to the redemption of these notes, and the
manner in which they should be redeemed,
there cannot of course be much difference of
opinion. It is in regard to a contraction of
the currency, and upon which of the two kinds
of currency United States notes or the notes
ol the national banksโcontraction should be
brought to bear that a difference of sentiment
seems to exist.
In his report to Congress under date of the
-1th of December, 1805, the Secretaiy jne-
