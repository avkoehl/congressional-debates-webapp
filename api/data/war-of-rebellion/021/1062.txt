Brigadier-General SCURRY,

Commanding, &amp;c., Houston, Tex.:

GENERAL: Since my letter of the 28th instant General Smith has learned that none of the troops designated are armed. If such is the case he desires that you will arm them if possible from your supplies.

The concentration of these troops upon the Sabine places them in front of General Banks should he attempt to reach Texas by direct march. It also places them at a convenient point for action should the enemy undertake the coast of Texas.
