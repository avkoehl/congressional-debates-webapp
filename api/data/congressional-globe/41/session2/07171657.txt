banks should be discouraged, if not prohibited,
from embarking money in extravagant risks
for extravagant profits.
The sum of one per cent, proposed to be
appropriated to defray all the expenses of the
loan, including paper, engraving, printing, ad-
vertising, and agencies, is the same amount
we have heretofore appropriated, and as only
so m ch will be used as is absolutely neces-
sary, it is not too great to be trusted in the
hands of an upright Secretary of the Treasury.
If the present low rates of interest should be
retained in the bill, it is not enough. If we
could obtain the loan on these terms, we might
well afford not to higgle about any bonns of
twice or thrice the amount. But the agencies
are not likely to be many, and these can be
obtained at an inconsiderable expense. And I
do not think if the loan ean be placed at four
or four and a half per cent, interest that any
one should object to providing that the pay-
ment of the interest should be made in any of
the capitals of Europe. The saving would
compensate for the additional expense. At
the same time it would be well to avoid snch
an obligation, and it would be entirely unneces-
sary if we fix upon five per cent, as our rate
of interest.
The importance of funding our large debt'at
a lower rate of interest cannot well be over-
stated. It wonld enable us to diminish taxa-
tion. By reducing the rates paid by the Gov-
ernment it would vastly cheapen the cost of
money to other borrowers. It wonld lessen
the labors of Congress, and remove beyond the
pale of discussion a fruitful theme for contro-
versy. Bat if we aim to drive too sharp a bar-1
gain in the terms we offer, as it most conclu-
sively appears to me we do aim, we shall fail
altogether, and any funding plan will be so &r
postponed as to place it beyond the power of
the present Administration to complete during
its present term of office. This would be unfor-
tunate for the country, and canse no rejoicing
exceptamongour political opponents. I think
I do them no injustice in supposing that they
will vote for the lowest figures in the rate of
interest, and that they will then exhibit a fair
share of Christian resignation should the loan
fail. It is our duty to make it a success.
Tf the Senate should fconcur with me that a
five per cent, loan is likely to be the best terms
npon which the United States can now fund
its debt, and fix that as a point beyond which
the Secretary of the Tre&suryshall not go,
leaving him all power to negotiate on cheaper
terms if he can, either by a lower rate of inter-
est or by obtaining a premium on the loan, the
present bill can easily be shorn of all other
objections which present themselves. We shall
then hare but one class of bonds, and a class
that we can to a large extent afford to keep at
home. Five per cent, paid to our own resident
citizens may fairly be maintained to be actually
cheaper than four per cent, paid to foreigners
and sent abroad to remain there forever. Nor
would there be any need of stipulations to pay
any bonds in sterling, francs, or tbalers. The
American eagle wonld pass current anywhere.
The national banks would escape being stabbed
in the house of their friends. Their securities
held for the protection of the people would be
retained intact. The retirement of the United
States notes would be made easy, and a coo-
sequent return to specie payments made possi-
ble. If all these advantages are well founded,
depending upon foregoing the dim prospect of
saving a fractional part of one per cent, in the
rates of interest, I submit to the judgment of
the Senate that we eannot afford to ignore
them in our action upon the present bill. The
country demands to be relieved of the subject.
Oar position subjects us to humiliation. With
our debt properly funded, and a sound cur-
rency convertible everywhere into specie* we
shall find our people inspired with new courage,
and we shall soon be ready to assume that con*
trolling financial position in the world with
which geography, agricultural resources, com-
mercial activity, and the genius of the Ameri-
can people has so long promised to crown the
United States.

Mr. MORTON. Mr. President, I recognize
as strongly as the Senator from Vermont, or
as.any other Senator, the necessity of funding
our debt into a bond bearing a low rate of in-
terest; and oneof the important questions now
connected with this bill is, what is the lowest
rate of interest we can sell a bond at par for ?
And I must say that there is a melancholy dif-
ference existing among the members of the
Finance Committee on that subject. The chair-
man of the committee, [Mr. Shebjlin,] in his
speech the other day, while urging the passage
of this bill, declared his preference for a five
per cent, loan, and acknowledged his want of
faith in the ability of the Secretary of the
Treasury to negotiate a loan at any lower rate
of interest. The Senator from Vermont [Mr
Morrill] has to-day argued that a four or four
and a half per cent, loan cannot be negotiated
at par; and his argument even goes to prove
that at this time a five per cent, loan eannot be
negotiated. I do not believe that a four per
cent, loan can be negotiated at par in this
country in greenbacks or in Europe in gold;
and I agree with the Senator from Vermont
that it would be • unfortunate for ns to offer a
loan that shall be rejected.
Mn President, how would it be possible to
negotiate a fonr per cent, bond at par in green-
backs in this country when the greenbacks can
be loaned for ten per cent, on approved mort-
gage security in any State in this Union ? There
is such a demand for money that money can be
loaned at ten per cent, interest upon approved
mortgage security in any State, East or West,
and even at greater rates in the West. Can
such a bond be sold at par in Europe? I saw
a letter this morning from a gentleman high
in position in Berlin, Prussia, stating that the
Austrian four per cents would not now sell for
more than eighty cents on the dollar; and an
examination of the list of stocks upon the va-
rious stock exchanges in Europe will show that
they do not sell for more than that, leaving out
the English consol and the French rentes. The
Government of Russia is regarded as one of
the most stable in Europe. It has always paid
its interest promptly, and during the Crimean
war it paid its interest to its English bond-
holders at the very time it was engaged in
hostilities with the British Government. The
Government of Russia is now trying to nego-
tiate a loan in England of $60,000,000, on a
bond to run eighty-one years, drawing five per
cent, interest, provided with a sinking fund that
shall liquidate the bond when the time expires;
and that bond is now offered on the English
market at seventy-nine and a quarter per cent.
I hold in my hands a copy of the London Tel-
egraph, bearing date January 6, 1870, and I
read an extract from the money article :
" Messrs. N. M. Rothschild & Sons have to-night
issued the prospectus of the new Russian loan. The
amount is £12,000,000 nominal, bearing interest at
five per eent., and the emission price is eighty per
cent., the bonds being in sums of fifty, one hundred,
five hundred, and one thousand pounds each, with
coupons payable half yearly on the 1st of August
and 1st of Febmary. A sinking fund will reimburse
these bonds at par in eighty-one years by annual
drawings, the first of which will take place on the
1st of February, 1871. The object of this loan, the
prospectus states, is the reenforcement of the impe-
rial railway fund, for the completion of the State
railways, and in order to assist in the future devel-
opment of thenet-work of such undertakings.conces-
sions for which have been granted to five specified
companies. Reckoning the discount given for pay-
ments in advance, the prioe of the stock will bo
reduced to aboutseventy-nine and one fourth, which
is considerably below tne existing Russian five per
cent, loans. The relative cheapness of the bonds
and high repute of the firm under whose auspices
they are offered may be considered as assuring tho
success of the loan, particularly sinoe Russian stocks
have always been popular with a large class of in-
vestors, from the confidence felt in the stability of
the borrowingState.and the punctuality nndfidclity
with which its obligations to foreign creditors have
been discharged."
I have a statement of the quotation of stocks
on the Bourse at Berlin on the 14th of Janu-
ary, and I find some eight four and a half per
cent, stocks issued by Prussia, beginning in
1864, at various dates; and the average price
of those stocks is ninety-two and a half per
cent., and those stocks were sold originally
some six or seven per cent, lower than the
price they now command npon the market.
Look at the State of Massachusetts, whose
credit is regarded as very nearly perfect as a
State—and the Senators from that State have
on various occasions spoken with pride of the
fact that Massachusetts paid bee interest in
coin all through the war: I find from a pam-
phlet I have in my hand, issued by a gentle*
man living in Paris, a banker, that last year
Massachusetts differed a loan upon the London
market of five per cent, bonds, to run thirty-
one years, and the highest price that was ob-
tained for it, and that only for a small part,
was ninety per cent. I also have an extract
from a Londbn paper, showing that the city
of Boston is now offering a loan of £700,000
on the English market, a five per cent, bond,
and is only asking eighty-seven percent, for it.
Now, sir, with these facts staring us in the
face, I ask what prospect there is of negotiat-
ing at par a four per cent, bond either in this
country or in Europe? And if there is no
prospect of it, need I argue to the Senate that
it is impolitic to make the offer? According
to the evidence presented, a four and a half
per cent, bond cannot be negotiated, and ac-
cording to the argument of the Senator from
Vermont a five per cent, bond cannot be nego-
tiated. But I believe that a five per cent, bond
can be negotiated abroad or in this country,
