there is exposed. If Pope and Buell will threaten the enemy's right in the morning we can risk the holding to-night. I wish you would assume the responsibility. Cannot Thomas come over and we go out to-night?

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

CAMP ON CORINTH ROAD, MISS.,

May 17, 1862.

Major-General SHERMAN, in Field:

Have sent a message to General Thomas to visit you to-night, and will direct Generals Buell and Pope to make a demonstration early tomorrow morning.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

CAMP ON CORINTH ROAD,

May 17, 1862.

Major-General SHERMAN, in Field:

If you hold Russell's to-night your whole division and Hurlbut's should be kept under arms, ready to support you in case of an attack.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

CAMP ON CORINTH ROAD, MISS.,

May 17, 1862.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN, in Field:

General Buell, without reasonable excuse, has failed to occupy the position assigned him yesterday. You will therefore use your own discretion about holding Russell's. If you deem it at all perilous, fall back, and it can be reoccupied tomorrow.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

CAMP ON CORINTH ROAD, MISS.,

May 17, 1862-9 p. m.

Major-Generals BUELL and POPE:

Major-General Sherman has determined to hold his position at Russell's house, but as he expects and attack in force early tomorrow morning, he wishes an early demonstration on the center and left as a diversion.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

CAMP ON CORINTH ROAD, MISS.,

May 17, [1862].

Major-General POPE, in Field:

Are you in position? General Buell's delay is very embarrassing. Right wing in position, but apparently unsupported by the center.
