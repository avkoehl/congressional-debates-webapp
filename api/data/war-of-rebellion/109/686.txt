this trouble, and to prevent shirking, malingering, &amp;c., the quartermaster's hospital was established, and I am satisfied it was an economical and valuable adjunct to the department. I will only add that the institution was made self-sustaining by a tax of 1 per cent. on the monthly pay of the employes. The fund arising from this tax was transferred to Captain C. T. Wing, assistant quartemaster, my general disbursing officer, and paid out by him on vouchers certified to by the quartermaster and senior surgeon in charge. Monthly abstracts and vouchers of this fund have been regularly transmitted to your office.

U. S. printing house.-The Methodist Publishing House-confiscable property-in the city of Nashville was taken possession of in January, 1864, by order of Major General George H. Thomas, commanding the department, and used as a Government printing house. The operations of the estalbishment up to June 30, 1864, were given in my last annual report. During the year ending June 30, 1865, over 5,300,000 impressions were made; 4,352 forms printed; 100,000 quires of paper used, and 22,380 quires of blanks furnished; at a total cost to the United States, including pay, commutation, &c., of enlisted men, of $29,261.40; actual cost to the Quartermaster's Department, $35,456.45. (These figures are shown by the monthly reports of the officer in immediate charge of the printing house, heretofore forwarded to your office.) The details of the establishment have been under the direction of Bvt. Major A. W. Wills, assistant quartermaster, who deserves great credit for its economical management. The average saving to the Government, taking Cincinnati, Chicago, Pittsburg, and Nashville prices, as shown by the monthly reports heretofore sent, is 82 1/2 per cent.; though it is believed the actual saving is fully 100 per cent. No work of any description is allowed until a requisition is first approved at this office. At this writing it is being turned over to the bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, as no longer needed for the public service. The concern merits my warmest praise, and I recommend it to your favorable notice and consideration.

Repair of unserviceable tentage.-Since June, 1863, the unserviceable tentage turned in at this depot and repaired under the supervision of Captain Thomas J. Cox, assistant quartermaster, has been as follows:

2,825 bell tents; 1,146 common tents; 1,320 wall

tents; 2,864 Sibley tents; 523 hospital tents;

total 8,678 (Government valuation)....................$650,000

Total................................................. 626,410

showing a saving to the Government of over $625,000. Great credit is due to Captain Cox for the economical management of this matter.

Purchases.-Purchases of horses, mules, forage, straw, fule, and small items of material not on hand at the depot, were made form time to time in the department during the year. They chief items of purcahse were horses and mules, and it is believed they were had at rates from $5 to $10 below prices North, to say nothing of the cost of transportation and danger of depreciation from a long journey in cars or on boats.

Reductions, &c.-April 17, 1865, Orders, Numbers 25, was issued to officers of the quartermaster's department in the Department of the cumberland to forthwith cease all logging and bulding operations; tor educe the number of employes to t he lowest figure compatible with the interest of the service, and to ship all surplus property and aricles for repair to the chief depots at Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knowville.
