(Received 10 a. m.)

Generals SCHOFIELD and HOWARD:

General Garrard is back; went seven miles; saw some horsemen and came back. General John E, Smith is at Resaca, and the enemy is at Spring Place. I think Generals Smith and Steedman can so manage that Wheeler will be driven north. Has General Schofield heard from his cavalry this morning!

Major- General SHERMAN:

I have just heard from Kilpatrick through Colonel Garrard. His dispatch is dated 12 m. Kilpatrick had moved up the Campbelton road toward the right of our infantry to a cross- road leading to Mount Gilead Church, where the rebel cavalry is encamped, with the intention of moving out an attacking them. My troops are ready to move at once if the enemy send infantry against our cavalry.

General SCHOFIELD:

Have you an idea where Mount Gilead Church is! Ascertain if possible from General Kilpatrick if he does not think with two of General Garrard's brigades in addition to his own he could break the Macon road effectually. I do not think General Garrard will try.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General, Commanding.
