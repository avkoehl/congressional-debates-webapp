If John B. Anderson is in Washington, I would like much to have him here immediately.

Colonel THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Louisville:

Anderson has been here, but went to Philadelphia Saturday. I expect him here to-night. He has already been making arrangements for increasing the rolling stock of the roads from Louisville to Chattanooga. I propose to appoint him military superintendent of that road, and will hurry him off to-morrow morning to join and act with you. General Meigs is at Chattanooga, if you have occasion to communicate with him. The whole force has gone forward from here expect some just paroled, who will go to-morrow. The advance were at Columbus at 3 o'clock to-day. If you have any directions for Anderson let me have them to-night.

EDWIN M. STANTON.
