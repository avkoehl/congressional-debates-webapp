answer to my repeated inquiries, I was informed that he had followed along a fence in a westerly direction and a right angles to the road over which I had traveled. I followed his trail a half mile or so, when I overtook him and delivered your order; whereupon he halted (he was at the head of Featherston's brigade) and asked me the road, I told him he was on the wrong road and going in the wrong direction; instead of going north he was going WEST. He then asked that I should lead the way and the would follow me. To which I replied that I was unacquainted with the roads, with the exception of the one over which I had traveled. He then gave the wore"forward"and continued in a northwesterly direction, but in a short time turned in a northeastern course and came up to the extreme left of Stevenson's DIVISION. At this point we were meant by Mr. Taylor, who delivered a more recent order from you. At this time and point I left him (Loring), and did not see him again. This was the last order which I carried on the field.

I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. H. BRYAN.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON.

MOBILE, ALA., July 30, 1863.

GENERAL: In obedience to your request, conveyed through General [T. H.]Taylor, I have the honor to send you the following extracts fro my diaries. I wound call you attention to the fact that I always wrote the orders I delivered in my book as soon as they were delivered, and cannot be mistaken either as to the time of their delivery of the language the orders. I carried several unimportant orders during the morning before 10 o'clock:

* * * The enemy were hard pressed at first, but about 2 o'clock General Stevenson sent for re-enforcements. General Pemberton sent me with this order to General Loring and Bowen: The order was carried to each. General Bowen rode up himself, and reported that the enemy were in heavy force in his front, and General Loring sent a major on his staff to report that the enemy were in his front, moving in heavy columns. At this time the enemy were driving back General Stevenson, and General Pemberton sent me with an order to General Bowen to move one brigade to Stevenson's left, and added,"Tell General Bowen to follow it up with another brigade? After I returned from General Bowen, general Pemberton sent me to General Loring to tell him that there were no troops between his left and Stevenson's right, and not to let the enemy come in. General Loring left Tilghman's brigade on his right, and closed up the gap with Buford's and Featherston's brigades.

* * * * * * *

I forgot to say that General Pemberton, in answer to the reports from both General Bowen and Loring that the enemy were moving in their front, had sent me with an order for them to move at them at once and crush them, and the return to the assistance of Stevenson. This brought the remark from General Loring, which he had communicated to General Bowen, that he would seize the proper moment and attack the enemy.
