JNumbers F. MILLER,

Colonel Twenty-ninth Indiana Volunteers, Commanding Seventh Brigade.

H. M. CIST,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. THIRD BRIG., SECOND DIV., FOURTEENTH CORPS,Murfreesborough, Tenn., March 6, 1863.

SIR: I respectfully ask leave to amend my official report of the part taken by my command in the battle of Stone's River so as to include the names of Lieut. Colonel D. M. Stoughton and Major G. F. Walker, Twenty-first Ohio Volunteers, in the special mention made of field officers, who were distinguished for gallantry in the engagements of Friday afternoon, January 2. Justice to these officers requires this amendment. At the time the report was written there was a dispute with respect to the conduct of those officers on the occasion referred to, which occasioned the omission. Full investigation has since been made.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers F. MILLER,

Colonel Twenty-ninth Indiana Volunteers, Comdg. Brigade.

Colonel C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
