THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 24,
Of the Paymaster General, showing, byway of
example, the assessed value of a single build-
ing, that occupied by the Paymaster General's
Department:
Paymaster General's OeSicS,.
Was Department,
Washington, February 8,1871.
Sir : In rfeply to your communication of this date,
by direction of the Committee on Appropriations
of the House of Representative?, I have the honor
to state that this office occupies the whole building
opposite the Treasury, corner of J? and JSifteenth
streets, at arental of&7,5u0peryear. ThelateSecre-
tary of War, Stanton, approved th&t rate fipon the
report of a board composed of intelligent, disinter-
ested persons appointed to determine the question.
The board, after a thorough investigation and in-
quiry, valued the property ats93;oo0, and ascertained
that the property might be rented to individuals for
at least $10,000; but in consideration of the Govern-
ment keeping the property in repair, and the. risk
of fire being greatly diminished by the constant pres-
ence da-y and night of watchmen, and other precau-
tions, they reported as fair and equitable the sum
now paid as above stated. . .
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
B. W. BRICE,
Paymaster General.
M;ij or RoBERf I. Stevens, Clerk Committee on Appro-
priations, House of Representatives.
Now sir, this building, which is rented by
the United States at a Valuation of $95,000, is
assessed, as will be seen by the following let-
ter, at only $20,000:
Collector's Office,
.. West Wing of City Hall,
Washington, D. C., February 8,1871.
Sib: Ini reply to your request as to the assessed
value of the building opposite the Treasury, square
225, lot 8, I have the honor to inform you that the
assessed value is 820,000. The rate of taxation on
$100 for the year 1870 is $180.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,
F. A. BOSWELL, Collector.
Robert I. Stevens, esq.,_
Clerk Committee on Appropriations.
From the facts exhibited in these documents
the House will understand that the rate of tax-
ation in .this city is not based upon any fair
valuation of the property. On the contrary,
if the building which I have selected as an
example is a fair test, the Ordinary valuation
is only about one fifth of the real value of the
property. Adopting as a basis the real value,
the rate of taxation in this city, I undertake to
Say, would not equal one half of one per cent.,
and probably not one third of one per eent.
Now, in the face of all that, the gentleman
front Tennessee tells us that this city is sup-
ported necessarily at the expense of the na-
tional Treasury. Why should it be so? Why
should not the property of this city bear a rate
of taxation as high as that of other cities of
the country?
Mr. Speaker, this is the last time, I presume,
I shall ever say anything against an appropria-
tion for this District. I have protested again
and again against the taxation of my constitu-
ents for the support of this city, where taxa-
tion is less than in any other city in the world,
and a city which derives more benefit from the
presence of the capital, in the presence of the
Government, than aiiy othercity in the country.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. LAWRENCE. I ask unanimous con-
sent to publish in the Globe, in connection with
rhy remarks, the table to which I have referred.
There was no objection.
The paper is as follows:

Mr. DICKEY. I am astonished, profoundly
astonished, that my colleague on the Com-
mittee on Appropriations should have selected
this as his particular point of attack upon the
charities of Congress in this District. My col-
league on the committee will read for the
benefit of this House tables with reference to this
Woman's Lying-in-Hospital in this District.
The whole country, sir, even Ohio, is largely
benefited by this charity. I am surprised and
astonished, profoundly astonished, that my
colleague on the committee should take this
as his especial point of attack. The Commi ttee
on Appropriations were convinced that this is
one of the best charities to which we contribute
Government aid in this city.. It is oiie Of the
best managed and one of the most useful chari-
ties to which we appropriate a dollar.
And this particular provision is for the pur-
chase of a building. For many years we have
been in the habit of appropriating $3,000 for
rent. They propose to buy the property at an
expense of $25,000, instead of paying $3,000
a year rent, and to vest the title in the United
States and to give us a control in the direc-
tion of the hospital. It is better than any of
these other charities for this reason, that they
propose to raise an equal amount by private
contributions in the city. They propose to
vest the title of this real estate iu the United
States and to give us the control and govern-
ment of the hospital. So far as any evidence
appears before the committee with which the
gentleman is familiar, this is one of the best
if not the very best charity in this city to which
the Government contributes a dollar. I will
yield now to my colleague on the committee
from New York.
Mr. KELSEY. Mr. Speaker, I wish to an-
swer some of the remarks of the gentleman
from Ohio in reference to this, one of the most
deserving charities in the District of Columbia.
It is a benefit to every State in the Union and
to the inhabitants of every State. I will read
the last report of that institution in proof of
what I say. It will be seen that the State of
Ohio has thirty-one in that institution.
Mr. McCOKMICK, of Missouri. What
proportion has each State ?
Mr. KELSEY. I will read the report and
the'n.gentlemen can judge of the statistics each
for himself.
