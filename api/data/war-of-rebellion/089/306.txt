Nothing unusual has transpired along our front line. The cavalry vedettes report quite heavy bodies of the enemy moving in their front between midnight and 2 a.m. I have sent out to ascertain more in relation to the report. Will forward as soon as received.

JNO. G. PARKE,

I have inquired where the cavalry vedettes were posted and what direction the enemy were moving, infantry or cavalry, &amp;c.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

This had better be sent to General Gregg, with directions to inquire into it at once, and if there is anything in it to endeavor by an active reconnaissance to ascertain something definite. Urge promptness in investigation and reporting.

HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, October 22, 1864.

(Received 1.20 p.m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

My staff officer has just returned, and reports the whole story of enemy moving along our rear a complete fabrication. It appears the vedette was fired upon about midnight, retired to the infantry picket, and reported to the lieutenant in charge the movement of the enemy. The report them came regularly up. The fault is that the intermediate commander did not investigate the matter. Two or three of cavalry posts were fired upon during the night, evidently by horse-thieves.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

This had better be sent to General Gregg.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
