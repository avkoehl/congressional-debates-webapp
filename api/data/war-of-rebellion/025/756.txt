once to Panola, and get there before the enemy if he should move a column in that direction. I will go up at any time you think advisable- to-morrow, if necessary.

JACKSON, MISS., November 21, 1862.

Major General EARL VAN DORN,

Abbeville, Miss.:

Send cavalry out in the adjoining country and seize as many negroes as may be necessary for work on Pontotoc.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

ABBEVILLE, November 21, 1862.

General PEMBERTON:

Force here cannot be spared yet to send to Pontotoc. I think I am getting all the negroes I can. We have not enough troops here to defend this line. There is represented to be a good road leading from Frial's Point, on Mississippi River, to Charleston and Coffeeville. I have a brigade of mounted Texas at Tobytubby Ferry. The most cavalry force can be concentrated at Panola in necessary, should enemy advance in that direction. Report from Colonel Jackson does not confirm the report that Sherman's corps is near La Grange, but that one of the army corps has moved westward to Moscow. No advance from Memphis. Heavy works required at Wyatt if put on opposite side. Have works on this side.

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.

ABBEVILLE, November 21, 1862.

General PEMBERTON:

Cavalry brigade at Tobytubby. Brigade can reach there before enemy. No movements yet from Memphis. Enemy going down river, as well as re-enforcing Memphis; supposed destination White River, to get in rear of Holmes; may be Yazoo River. Reported strength at Grand Junction, &amp;c., about 60,000; probably about 45,000; from reports, will be soon on the march. If you fight the battle here you should be here now to learn position, &c. You must have more men.

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.

ABBEVILLE, November 22, 1862.

General PEMBERTON:

It is my opinion that if Holmes does not sent troops to this side river soon the opportunity will be lost. The troops at Memphis may take position at Milliken's Bend to prepare for operations against Vicksburg.

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.
