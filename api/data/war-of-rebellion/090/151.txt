gallant actions of the regiments, brigades, and divisions of the corps. They are shown in the reports of their commanders herewith, and are to be taken in connection with this in order to have a perfect idea of the obstinacy of the action, the various minor movements made by their respective commanders to meet the exigencies of the movement, and to present the gallant conduct of officers and men on this hardbought field, to whose bravery the country is indebted, so far as this corps is concerned, for the success of the day. Neither have I referred to other commands further than was necessary to present a general and connected history of the battle. Much in regard to them which fell under my own observation, and that of the most important and gallant character, has been omitted entirely as having no reference to the movements of this corps. The battle of the Opequon affords a rare example in the many hard-fought fields of this war in which all the arms of service could co-operate with full effect. Infantry, cavalry, and artillery had their full share in the operations of the day, and their movements were in entire harmony. The artillery of this corps alone expended eighteen army wagon-loads of ammunition, and all with good effect upon the results of the conflict. All of my batteries were effectively engaged.

To specify particular officers or organizations where all did so well, where almost every officer and man did his duty gallantly, would seem invidious, and I shall therefore speak only of my staff, who each and all performed their whole duty to my entire satisfaction, and of the division commanders, Generals Ricketts, Getty, and Upton, and Colonel Thompkins, chief of artillery, who, by their gallantry and the skill with which they handled their respective commands, did much toward securing the successes of the day. For the distinguished services brigade and regimental commanders and individual officers I would revere to the reports herewith.

In closing this report I cannot refrain from adverting to the gallant commander of the First Division, Brigadier General D. A. Russell, who lost his life while bravely leading his command into action at a critical period of the battle-an officer whose merits were not measured by his rank, whose zeal never outran his discretion, whose abilities were never unequal to the occasion, a man tenderly just to his friends and heartily generous to has fores. In the memory of this entire command there will ever live a sincerity of admiration and respect, a richness of glorious recollections to foster the widespread influence which his life created, worthy only of such a character and of deeds like his.

Getty, commanding Second Division; Brigadier General james B. Ricketts, commanding Third Division; Brigadier General D. D. Bidwell, commanding Third Brigade, Second Division; Colonel J. M.
