COMMANDING OFFICERS OF REGIMENTS ON

EXPEDITION TO THE LOWER COUNTIES OF Maryland:

COLONEL: It has been reported that certain individuals who have been in Virginia under arms against the Government have returned to their homes and intend to take part in the election on the 6th instant. It is also understood that other individuals, residents in Maryland, who have been in sympathy and have given secret aid to the enemy, have concerted with the aforesaid individuals to obstruct the freedom of the coming election and control the votes in favor of their revolutionary scheme. In view of these facts, and in pursuance of my instructions, you will hold your regiment in this town or its immediate vicinity, and will take such measures as will secure free and independent action at the polls. You will arrest promptly any man who talks open treason and hold him until the next day. Any one you find who has been secretly in arms against our forces you will keep a prisoner. You will preserve the strictest order in your own command, not allowing the slightest depredation. You must hold your officers individually responsible, as I do you, for the sobriety and good behavior of their repsective commands. Remember that yours is a friendly command in a friendly country.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. O. HOWARD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
