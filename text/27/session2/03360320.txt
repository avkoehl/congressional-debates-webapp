When Mr MORGAN called upon iho Chan to say whether
the appeal was deb Hable or rfbr
Tlie SPEAKER said the appeal was not debatable, tho pre
vious q jeoüoñ having been called
Some conversation followed, when the Speaker stated the
question, to the Hoube, and th< grounds of his decision
Mr GUSHING said there wa& so much conversation that he
luid not been aide to hear the observations of the Speaker in
ata mg his derision
The SPEAKER satd that he had overruled the point of older,
first, because, even if this were a report of a committee, the
Speaker conld not, on his own responsibility, undervake to say
that the committee had transcended its poweia—a fact which
did not at all appear But if that were true, this was merely a
resolution proposing an mquny into tho expediency of an m

of the Chair, even obligatory on the committee its If

Sir, 1 would ask gentlemen who ha\ not daied to deny thia
power m terms, but who have buried it up in qualifications
and inexpediencies until it can scarcely be seen—who have
whispered out a tame concession of it as if they feared the
Executive would oveihear them—if this is not an occaeior*
for us to repie&ent the will and interests of our constituents
in the exercise of a just, reasonable, and necessary legisla-
tive function? The light to abolish by law the office of Firet
Auditoi, and to confer his duties upon another functionary,
would be denied by no one Is thete anything more extra-
vagant in the proposition now beloie the committee, which is
simply to nd omsclves of an unfaithful and incompetent
officer, and to impose htsdutiestemporaiily and until the place
can be «upplied upon the subordinates m the depaitmenl? L>
there any stretch of power, any impracticable effort, any m
terfereuce with the operations of Government, in this1 No
thiag of the kind, su 1 he very termt= of the proposition will
mfoun the Executive and the countiy of our object and design,
and bear with it out full junification He and they will un-
derstmd out meining The moment a pioper incumbent is
fuinh-htd foi this responsible office the appropuatun will be
foithcommg and all will go on aa usual \ea, more, sir, we will
not only bedischaiging a solemn duty which we owe thecoun-
ly, but will ft ch a le son tn the Executive which I trust will
not be thrown away upon lum, unless, indeed, like Festus, he
be deaf o the wordt, of soberness and truth And our con
stituents will moic than justify us they will applaud the act—
they will hail it a^ the fiist and long dtbired blow at Execu
tive tyranny and nii&rule they will rejoice to see the bow of
Government thus drawn to Us e\tiemest tension, and they
disabused of their feais lest it has lo^t much of Us force and
elasticity
i>ir, it is high time for the Representatives of the people to
be thaiy of then j oweis Wearedaily falling upon events in
theadmmistration of the Government, which, if we would pre
serve its purity and oui own independence must not be suffer
ed to pass unobserved The exercise of the appointing power,
as j lac'ised for many years past, is, to say the least, of doubt
ful constitutional authority It ha-s abuses which are scarcely
tolerahl" even when it is confined to removals and appoint
ments for meie opinion's «ake Extend it as it has been to re-
taining in office men of acknowledged and notorious unfitness,
although differing in political sentiment from a majority of the
p opie—extend it as nis been, as a lewaid for political treach
eivand the most servile peisonal adulation, .mdjouvil) mt
only di am the feculence of ¡ arty of its ranke-^t sediment, but,
if left unrebuked and unresisted, entail upon the country a
wore than Eastern despotism
Sir, m the short history of this country, we have had some
strange exhibitions of the peiversions of our system—some
strange executive exactions and usurpations, and stil! stranger
acquiescence in them Most of these have har pened during the
last twelve years Until then the Government was administered
with due regard to the simplicity and purity of its Republican
forms Not so at the present time Take, for example, the
heads of tne sevcial depa^tmen's of ihe Government These
are i ' iv«own o oi letogni&ed by the Constitution, but aie'tle
offspring of law, and were ongmally intended and understood
to bethemeie keepers of buieaus, or chief cieiks in the various
departments of Go\einment What have they becorre1 Trom
the meie advibcis oí the President upon affairs belonging to
then ie>pective de, aitments, they have grown mtoasoit of
Cabinet Council, and become the sharers of the responsibilities
of (he Admini--tiation—the shield  of the Executive Both thto-
letically ant practically this i& an infrm^ement of ¡he Constitu-
tion—the election of a new powei in the Government at the ex-
pense of the freedom and usefulness of important and mdispei -
sable departments in the management of pub'ic afiairs It is
also an unwarrantable extension of Execuuve power and pa
tronage Although appoint dfor a period determined by law,
and in fact as independent of the Executive, during the continu-
ance of their term, as any other of the functionaries of Govern-
ment, the tenure of their office depends upon their agreement
with and obedience to the Executive And, as a consequence of
this, tne administration of these departments are deprived of all
independence—the heads of them are reduced to the servile tools
of the President, who is, dzfacto, the swoidand the purse oí the
i ation
Nor is this all We have thus adopted a monarchical fea-
ture of the very worst tendency, unknown to the written Con-
stitution and forbidden m the very gemus and spirit of our in-
stitutions And, as m all cases where the popular form of Go-
vernment is permitted to run into the monarchical channel, the
stream often becomes swol en and ttnbid, and offensive in the
last degree When Democrats undertake to play the Aristo
ciar, as they often do, even v,hen their piofes^ions ofDemocra-
ty are the lou 'est, they do it with a vengeance feuch, at all
eve its, is the tes imony which our ' Cabmets have afforded
as compared with the ' Ministry  in monaichical Govern
ments, and to which they are intended to be assimilated In the
hi toiyofGicatE i tarn we mo t generally find the Ministry re
signing on account of their disagreement m some great public
measure demanded by the | eople thiough then lepiesentation
m Parliament and scarce!; eversokly on account of the disaf-
fection n the crov n towaids them Heie in every instance m
which the event has transp red, it has been occasioned by a
disagreement between the Cabinet and the Executive, and in no
case upon the requisition of the people or of Congress Indeed,
almas' simultaneous with the resignation of the British Minis
try who agreed with Queen Victoria, but unfortunately were
not acceptable to Parliament oji Cabinet a e forced to resign,
for not unitino- with a President in his ciusade upon a measure
vilai to them erests of the country, and twice adopted by large
maionties of both bianehe  of Congre& , represei ting the sove-
reign y of the nation
If then fiom any necessity, wc mint engtaft upon our
system monarchical forms let us at least be -ure of preserv-
ing the only Republican feat me they ha\ &—obedience to the
people Let us rot be outdone by them ir this particular
'■Mr what is it that has pn served English hber'y from the
