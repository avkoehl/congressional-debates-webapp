In accordance with orders from general headquarters, this corps will move to the neighborhood of the Woody house and take position between the Fifth Army Corps and the Eighteenth Army Corps, on the space now occupied by General Birney's division.

General Warren will relieve General Crittenden's division this evening, and furnish him with a guide to his position. The subsistence of the command will be issued to-night after the arrival at Woody's. My headquarters will be in the neighborhood of Woody's.
