of the Eighth Illinois Cavalry to carry out the provisions of said instructions as far as lies within his power. All persons arrested you will confine as prisoners of war and at such points within your department as you may deem best, or I will authorize the transfer of them to Fort McHenry. The information which I have received confirms your dispatch that the forces sent from Richmond crossed over into the Valley from Culpeper, with the exception that General Anderson is in command instead of Longstreet. You will please forward frequent reports of the information that you may receive.
