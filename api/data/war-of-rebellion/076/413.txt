Statement of J. M. Glass (scout).

OFFICE PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL, Near Atlanta, Ga., August 7, 1864.

Says he left Atlanta, Ga., yesterday morning about 10 o'clock; says the right of the enemy's line is held by militia supported by one brigade of Hardee's corps; with this exception all the old troops are on the center and on the left. Hardee's corps is on the left flank of the army. From the best information he could get thinks there are at least 15,000 militia. One brigade of militia came in from some point below on the 4th instant. Learned that 1,700 of General Stoneman's command were captured; heard a rumor to the effect that General Wheeler will be relieved of his command because he did not capture the whole of Generals Stoneman's and McCook's commands. Two brigades of Wheeler's corps were sent to Flat Shoals on the 5th instant. An orderly on duty at General Hood's headquarters told him, Glass, that General Lee was expected from Virginia also that General Ewell was looked for at Atlanta with his corps, said to be 32,000 strong. Same orderly said that he believed from the manner in which things were going on about headquarters that preparations were being made for a sudden flank movement of some kind. The large guns have all been removed from the fort east of the cemetery. Do not think Hood is accumulating supplies in Atlanta; think they only arrive as they are needed by the troops. Trains are running regularly on the Macon and Atlanta road. Two hundred prisoners were sent below on the 5th
