General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Commanding Army of the Mississippi.

GENERAL: I am in receipt of a communication from S. E. Chaille, medical inspector on your staff, inquiring the cause of arrest of fifteen citizens whose names he gives. In reply I beg leave to say the men were not arrested by my order. When the guard having them in charge reported to me supposing I was in command on this side of the river I ordered them to report to you with their capture for final disposal and addressed a note to you to that effect. I have the honor to state that I know nothing of the cause of arrest of the fifteen citizens.

I am, general, your obedient servant,

L. POLK,
