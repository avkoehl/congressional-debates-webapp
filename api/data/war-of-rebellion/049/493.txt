HEADQUARTERS,November 26, 1863-4. 30 p. m.

Major-General FRENCH,

Commanding Third Corps:

Send your artillery to cross at Germanna. The road is bad here, but the artillery has crossed. Your artillery can join you by a branch road leading from Germanna plank road, about 1 1/2 miles from the ford. General Warren will encamp at Flat Run Church on plank road. Move forward on your route so as to admit of Sedgwick's crossing and halting for the night.

Send strong working party in at once to put the road in order leading from Germanna plank road to you. Mr. McGee, a guide, is sent to you. He professes too know the road from jacobs' Ford to Robertson's Tavern. Your pickets should connect with Waren's.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,November 26, 1863.

Major-General FRENCH,

By order:

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD ARMY CORPS,November 26, 1863-6. 30 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

General Prince got on the wrong road and had to retrograde. His head of column came upon the enemy's cavalry pickets, and had a small skirmish. The guide you sent has joined General Prince.

Respectfully,
