the compliment to myself or to him, but will generously give him the benefit of the doubt, and admit that it was taken without difficulty so far as his exertions contributed to its capture. The statement of officers hereto appended are sent, not to verify anything I have stated in my report, but only to throw light on the position operations of the cavalry. It is worth notice that Captain Shepperd states he met the cavalry on his return for ambulances almost 1 1/2 miles in the rear of Manassas Station (the railroad junction is three-quarters of a mile from Manassas Station, commonly called the Junction), probably on the exact spot where we left them, and that they asked him if we had captured Manassas.

I beg that you will insert by interlineation in my report that the capture took place about 12.30 a. m. the night of August 26 and 27, and I further request that the foregoing explanations may be appended to my report and accompany it as official. Having had access to my notes, I subjoin a list of part of the stores taken by the capture:

Schedule of part of public property captured at Manassas Junction.

Pounds of bacon..................................... 50,000

Barrels corned beef................................. 1,000

APRIL 10, 1863.

The undersigned, officers of the Twenty-first Georgia Regiment, were present and participated in the capture of Manassas Junction on the night of August 26 last. After a fatiguing march, arrived at Bristoe Station about night, and then recommenced the march to Manassas Junction, with the Twenty-first North Carolina Regiment, commanded by Brigadier-General Trimble. We attacked and captured Manassas Junction about 12 o'clock, this regiment charging and capturing a battery of artillery (four pieces) and about 70 prisoners, including a lieutenant-colonel and several commissioned officers. We were fired into by shell and canister and musketry, which we returned and then charged. We placed pickets out and guarded the approaches to the Junction on the left side, which were maintained until after day. About sunrise Stuart's cavalry arrived in the town.

We had not previously seen them nor any other troops, except those of our own brigade.

THOMAS C. GLOVER,

Major, Commanding Twenty-first Georgia, et al.
