CHANCELLORSVILE, VA.,

May 4, 1863 - 11 a. m.

Major-General SEDGWICK:

The major-general commanding directs me to say that he does not wish you to cross the rive at Banks' Ford unless you are compelled to do so. The batteries at Banks' Ford command the position. If it is practicable for you to maintain a position south side Rappahannock, near Banks' Ford, your will do so. It is very important that we retain position at Banks' Ford. General Tyler commands the Reserve Artillery there.

J. H. VAN ALEN,

Brigadier-General and Aide-de-Camp.

SIXTH CORPS,

May 4, 1863 - 11 a. m.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD, and

General HOOKER:

I hold the same position. The enemy are pressing me hard. If I can hold until night, I shall cross at Banks' Ford, under instructions from General Hooker, given by Brigadier-General Warren.

JOHN SEDGWICK,

Major-General.

SEDGWICK'S HEADQUARTERS,

May 4, 1863 - 11.15 a. m.

Major-General HOOKER:

The enemy threatens me strongly on two fronts. My position is bad for such attack. It was assumed for attack and not for defense. It is not improbable that bridges at Banks' Ford may be sacrificed. Can you half me strongly if I am attacked?

JOHN SEDGWICK,

Major-General.

P. S. - My bridges are 2 miles from me. I am compelled to cover them above and below from attack, with the additional assistance of General Benham's brigade alone.

CHANCELLORSVILLE, VA.,

May 4, 1863 - 11.50 a. m.

Major-General SEDGWICK:

If the necessary information shall be obtained to-day, and if it shall be of the character he anticipates, it is the intention of the general to advance to-morrow. In this event the position of your corps on the south bank of the Rappahannock will be as favorable as the general could desire. It is for this reason he desires that your troops may not cross the Rappahannock.

J. H. VAN ALEN,

Brigadier-General and Aide-de-Camp.
