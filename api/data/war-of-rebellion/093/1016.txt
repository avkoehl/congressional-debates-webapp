COLUMBIA, November 24, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

The most of my troops are here and in position. The enemy has shown no force but cavalry so far. I have heard nothing from Hatch since yesterday noon.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, November 24, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Columbia:

Your dispatch of this date received. Did you get my dispatch of 9 this a.m.? Report, as soon as you learn, whether our troops hold the fords across Duck River, below Columbia. I ordered Cooper yesterday to march this morning for Centerville; he ought to get there to-morrow, when that place will be safe. I have also ordered Thompson to have the Duck River patrolled by his troops below Centerville to its mouth; he will have his troops on the river to-morrow. Have started about 1,000 additional cavalry to-day for Columbia, to report to General Wilson. Have the fords above Columbia as well guarded as you can, and I think you will then have checked the advance of Hood, and we shall have time to get up our re-enforcements.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

Give me as full a report to-night as you can.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

COLUMBIA, November 24, 1864-1.39 p.m.

Major General G. H . THOMAS:

Do you think it important to hold Columbia? My force is not large enough to cover the town and railroad bridge. I can hold a shorter line covering the railroad bridge, leaving the town and railroad depot outside; but in any case the enemy can turn the position by crossing above or below, and render my withdrawal to the north bank very difficult. Please give me your views soon.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

COLUMBIA, November 24, 1864 -[3 p.m.]

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville:

Your dispatch of this p.m. is just received; I did not get the one of 9 a.m. I have not yet heard from the troops sent to the fords below here; will inform you the moment I do. Have just sent you a dispatch from General Hatch, dated 10 p.m. yesterday, which is the latest; expect to hear again soon. There is some skirmishing in our front, but the enemy has displayed only cavalry.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
