RICHMOND, June 25, 1863.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD:

From causes into which it is needless to enter, the control of the Mississippi connection between the States east and west of it will be lost unless Johnston is strongly and promptly re-enforced within the next sixty days.

Can you give him further aid, without the probable loss of Charleston and Savannah? I need not state to you that the issue is vital to the Confederacy.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
