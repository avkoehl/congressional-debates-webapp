CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that the EIght Illinois Cavalry, sent yesterday morning to scour the front of this line, has returned with four prisoners, three of them soldiers and one a citizen, who was taken under suspicious circumstances, and who, I think, may be a guerrilla. I divided the command into squads of from fifteen to thirty men and effectually scoured the country from the Orange and Alexandria Railroad to the Potomac River, and as far out as Brenstville, Gainesville, Aldie, and nearly to Leesburg. Nothing was learned of any movements of a suspicious character. I returned to camp between 12 and 1 o'clock this morning.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. R. CLENDENIN,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Regiment.
