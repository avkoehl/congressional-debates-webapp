HEADQUARTERS NINTH CORPS,August 25, 1864-2.30 p. m.

General WARREN:

I have 125 men on picket immediately on your right, belonging to Willcox's division, and apparently covering your front. Can you conveniently relieve these men, as Willcox is under orders for immediate movements?

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 25, 1864-2.45 p. m.

General PARKE:

I have just sent works to General Ayres to relieve Willcox's skirmishers.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,August 25, 1864.

PARKE.

AUGUST 25, 1864-6.10 p. m.

Major-General PARKE, Commanding Ninth Corps:

General Warren is temporarily absent. Nothing has been received from General Hancock since the heavy firing began.

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH CORPS,August 25, 1864-10.30 p. m.

Major-General WARREN:

I have been directed to send White's division to the support of General Hancock. The dispatch states that Crawford will take command of White's division as well as his own. Please inform me where Crawford may be found in order that White may report to him.

JNO. G. PARKE.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS,August 25, 1864-10.45 p. m.

General PARKE:

You had better a staff officer to me to find out where General Crawford is.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

P. S.-No other news except that General Meade says the enemy broke through Hancock's right. Wilcox's division may be sufficient to enable him to drive the enemy back, but he will probably need more re-enforcements.

G. K. W.
