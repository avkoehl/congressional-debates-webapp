OFFICE CHIEF OF CAV., MIL. DIV. OF WEST MISS.,

September 14, 1864.

There is no cavalry in reserve in the Department of the Gulf. I know of no regiment serving in districts or with the Nineteenth Army Corps that can be spared away from its present duties.

Respectfully submitted.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

The purposed expedition is promising, and I approve of it; but two things must be insisted on in pursuing it: First. The point and time
