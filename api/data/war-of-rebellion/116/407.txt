GENERAL: I received your communication of the 26th instant last evening. I can discover no good reason why-you and myself cannot renew the exchange of prisoners as heretofore. I will make an effort to bring it about; at the same time call attention to Colonel Hoffman and Captain Barron. I send with the flag of truce Mr. [Carl O.] Witte, Swedish vice-consul at Charleston. Also a few letters for the South.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
