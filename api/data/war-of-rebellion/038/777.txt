Brigadier-General TILGHMAN, Canton, MISS.:

The movement, if any is required, will be made without wagons. You will keep three days' rations cooked. Wagons will be sent after you, if thought necessary. You will make your requisitions on quartermaster for corn, which Major Mims says will be found at any of the depots from Canton up.

CAMARGO, April 22, 1863-11 a. m.

Brigadier General DANIEL RUGGLES,Comdg. 1st Dist., DEPT. of MISS. and E. La., Columbus, MISS.:

GENERAL: A reliable scout, just in from the vicinity of Iuka, reports three brigades of Federal infantry, with large wagon train. A large number of pack-mules and considerable artillery crossed Tennessee River on Friday last. He heard that some 7,000 crossed at Pittsburg Landing on Thursday. These troops came to Corinth on Tuesday; said they were from Memphis. On Saturday, 400 cavalry came to Jacinto, who also stated they were from Memphis; this party went to Iuka. This scout came from Booneville yesterday morning; says there are no Federals on Mobile and Ohio Railroad this side their outpost (Camp Davies). He heard firing Sunday in the direction of Bear Creek. A citizen from Russellville, Ala., informs me that Roddey had a fight on that day and repulsed the enemy, taking 200 prisoners and two pieces of artillery. I learn that Colonels [J. F.] Smith and Barteau passed Houston yesterday noon, and Lieutenant-Colonel [J.] Cunningham later in the day, in pursuit of the enemy, who camped near that place Monday night. Their force is about 1,600 mounted men, and five pieces artillery. If not ordered otherwise, I shall return to Tupelo to-morrow morning, as I can connect with a courier first 12 miles from that place, and get dispatches through very nearly as soon as from this place.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. M. BURTON.
