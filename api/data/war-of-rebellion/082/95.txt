Sheridan to get off on the 13th. How far do you think the infantry support should go? The whole distance, forty miles, or only part of the way?

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.

CITY POINT, VA., July 9, 1864.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

Send in the balance of the Sixth Corps to be forwarded to Washington. They need not take their artillery or wagons with them. The rebels have crossed the Monocacy, and Halleck gives it as his opinion that one-third of Lee's army is with them. They are now calling urgently for troops, and I am in hopes with Wright the enemy will not be able to get back.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
