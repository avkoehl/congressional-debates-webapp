me that Colonel Hall, Forty-sixth North Carolina Regiment, ought to be brought back at once, and his place supplied, if necessary, by local troops, say exchanged prisoners, under a good officer.

Our fight may come off to-morrow, and Hall is the best colonel I know in the service. His loss would be seriously felt in a field fight.

With Baker at Old Church, we ought to get timely notice of an advance upon Hanover Junction.

With great respect,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.
