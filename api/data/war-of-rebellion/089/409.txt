HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, SIGNAL DEPARTMENT,October 28, 1864.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: In addition to the movements already reported, at 3 p. m. a column of about 1,800 infantry came toward Petersburg on the Boydton plank road and halted in the woods west of the Weldon railroad, and remained there until night. At 3.30 p. m. 600 more came on the same road and moved on toward Petersburg, disappearing behind the woods near the lead-works. At 5.30 about 1,000 came up the Boydton plank road and disappeared in the vicinity of the fort near the Weldon railroad. At 4 p. m. about 1,000 men went into the intrenchments east of Butterworth's house. A strict watch was kept upon the roads leading into the city from the west and no troops were seen entering it, so I would conclude all the troops that came up the Boydton plank road went into the works in our front.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. FISHER,

Major and Chief Signal Officer, Army of the Potomac.
