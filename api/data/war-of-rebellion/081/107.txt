became so warmly engaged that I deemed it necessary to countermand it and withdraw General Ames' force to a position to cover Foster in case of need and to withdraw his own troops for a short distance. Prisoners taken say that the force in our front is Pickett's division; that it, with other troops, crossed the river this morning. They say they saw Lee in person at the crossing. They also report that other troops, Lee's whole army, are following Pickett.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ALF. H. TERRY,

Brigadier-General.

Dispatch received. You must withdraw as quickly and speedily as possible. I have sent word to Turner to withdraw also. You had better send an aide to him so to do also. See that your working parties are drawn in with their tools.

General TERRY:

Hold your picket-line on the line of the enemy's works from Howlett's round to your front, where our line was at first. Hold Ware Bottom Church with strong reserve, and do not yield it without a struggle. I hope to get up two divisions of Wright's corps to occupy it during the night or early in the morning.
