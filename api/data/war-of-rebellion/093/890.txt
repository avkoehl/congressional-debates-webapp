CHATTANOOGA, TENN., November 14, 1864.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

As directed by major-general commanding. I tendered assistance to General Ammen, and received the following reply:

KNOXVILLE, November 14, 1864.

The troops are coming to Strawberry Plains; a large part of the cavalry is in, and my infantry is back, having lost only three. One hundred rebels reported west of Morristown, some at Morristown, and some infantry and one battery fortifying at Bull's Gap. It is not supposed they will advance. I have not been able to get any reliable information of numbers; in my opinion, it is not 3,000 General Gillem is in town; I have not seen him. At present, I feel equal to the emergency. Thanks for the offer, and will call on you if pressed. The battery was lost.

J. AMMEN,

Brigadier-General.

All quiet in vicinity and on the road to Resaca. Nothing of the enemy in the direction of Trenton or Valley Head.

JAMES B. STEEDMAN,

Major-General.
