HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 27, 1864-4 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Deserters from Eleventh Florida, Finegan's brigade, came into the lines of the First Division, Second Army Corps, last evening, about 12 o'clock. Up to that time no movement took place on Mahone's front. Neither the men nor company officers of the Eleventh Florida knew of our movement. A very unintelligent deserter from Twenty-seventh North Carolina, Cooke's brigade, came in about noon to-day; came in from the picket-line. Went out on picket last evening, at which time his brigade had not moved. Understood this morning about 11 o'clock that the brigade had moved to the right. Cannot say that any other brigades have moved. Heard that his brigade (Cooke's) had gone toward the South Side Railroad.

Respectfully,

JNumbers C. BABCOCK.
