[CHAP. XLI.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION,December 3, [1863]-9 a.m.

Colonel C. ROSS SMITH,

Chief of Staff, Cavalry Corps:

COLONEL: Nothing remains at Richardsville but troops of my division. Ambulances and wagons carrying my wounded are just starting to Brandy Station. I sent an order to Colonel Devin to report at Culpeper. Yesterday, however, Captain Hynes, aide-de-camp, informed me that it was his impression that Devin's brigade had already been ordered away. This morning I sent a force to examine about Morrisville and United States Ford. The lower fords of the Rappahannock cannot be picketed or watched to any purpose, from this position, with my force. Some straggers must have fallen into the hands of the enemy on the Culpeper Ford road; not many, I think. Some of the enemy's cavalry were seen opposite Ellis' Ford yesterday. I suppose these were guerrilla scouts. The enemy's cavalry were rather late in following. Those that came to Ely's Ford looked rather fagged. I sent away the brigade of infantry this morning.

Yours, respectfully,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD ARMY CORPS,December 3, 1863-10.30 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: One of the brigades which was with Gregg, and which joined at Culpeper Ford, I ordered to remain, according to instructions from the major-general commanding, until all the trains had crossed Mountain Run. The other brigade not reporting before I marched, two regiments were directed to re-enforce the brigade at Richardsville and remain with it. The most of the trains not across Mountain Run were parked at Madden's.

Respectfully,

WM. H. FRENCH,

Major-General of Volunteers.

Captain NORTON:

Numerous camp smokes of the enemy appear opposite Raccoon and Morton's Fords and half way between the latter and Germanna. There was firing opposite Morton's Ford about 3 p.m., which lasted for half an hour. Could not communicate with you at 6 p.m., so I sent the above by orderly. Did you get it?

PAINE,

Signal Officer.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

L. B. NORTON,

Captain, and Chief Signal Officer, A. P.
