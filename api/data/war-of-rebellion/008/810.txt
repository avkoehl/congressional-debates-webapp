Battery Numbers 1, which, under command of Captain Rucker, did such excellent service during the engagement on the 17th instant, will only be fully serviceable again after the water will have fallen. Its guns, spiked by the enemy, are being unspiked. The rat-tail files have been removed out of two of the vents.

Three powder magazines on the Tennessee shore afford ample room for the ammunition on hand. They require strengthening on the tor.
