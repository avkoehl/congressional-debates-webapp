ATHENS, January 6, 1865.

Major BEAUMONT,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Direct Generals Long and McCook to send in a list of such regiments of their commands as they wish to have filled up. I have requested authority for Upton's regiments. As soon as these lists are in give them to General Thomas, with request that these regiments may be filled up. Tell Green that 271 horses leave here to-morrow for Nashville. I am glad to know he is making such efforts to recuperate broken-down stock. See General Thomas about stabling materials. Exert yourself to get all men on detached duty belonging to Hatch, Long, McCook, Upton, and Knipe, wherever they may be, sent to Eastport without delay. I have telegraphed to General Thomas about this. Tell Carling that he must find mules somewhere, and stir up everybody connected with the mule department; also to send hay, bran, and horse medicines to Eastport; without these we shall lose many horses. Where are my horses? I am almost afoot. You had better remain in Nashville until I reach Eastport.
