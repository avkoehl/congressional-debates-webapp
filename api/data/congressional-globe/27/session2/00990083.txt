deal in bills of exchange without funds, the Go- i
vernment would be discredited. All the certifi- !
cates of deposite could not be produced which
might be required, and who was to be favored? In
high times ot party excitement, when political ef-
fect was to be produced, who then would be favor-
ed? You must take human nature as it is, and if
you allow these powers to be given toan institu-
tion like this, you may expect that they will be
exercised. That those conjectures were well-
founded, he would read from the first message of the
President to this Congress, where he said he felt the
necessity of some fiscal agent. He said that upon
the establishment of siach an agency there might
be a control of political influence, if placed in the
hands of the administrators of Government, and
without jurisdiction. The temptation to abuse
would be irresistible. So thougnt the President
then, and for the reason that this power in the
ha'ids of Government agents, (to issue paper,)
without jurisdiction, would lead to gross abuse. A
truer sentence was never uttered than this, and
until human nature changed, it would betru¿
The experience of the last year, he was sorry .

One other remark upon died-tails of this bill, said
Mr, H. It provides that these agencies shall de-
termine the amount of Treasury notes and ceitiñ-
cates of deposite which shall be issued Th y de-
termine what S ate shall have an agenc>, and
what amount of Treasury note- that agency shall
have. The who'e amount of money was -abject

wou'd pa's 0' er to a-k it h a Plan wou'd benefit
the country in acurr-nc^ He thought not. Just
s-o ions as a deprec a ted currency is appreeia'ej
by public opinion, and tolerated by the legislature,
just so long would it be imponible to make a cur-
rency of those certificates ot deposite and Trea-
iury notes.
If i'were not for the feature in the bill which
authorized the dealing m bills of exchange, ¡t
would be impossible to make it of any general use,
the currency comed uudtr it seeking a common
centre, as regulated by the balance of trade. So
far  then, as regarded the circulation, he submitted
there would be an entire failure of the benefits pro-
posed. But supposing such an institution could
control all tbis—control the currency—no such
power, he contended, coeld be tolerated under a
free Government. Look at the power given to the
agents ever the money of the Government, and in
relation to the power of dealing in exchanges—
would there be any corrective of existing abuses?
The Government, for exchanges, he believed,
would have come to the mercantile men, instead of
the mercantile men coming to them for exchanges:
New Orleans, in cotton time, would eat up all
these agencies. Look at its practical operation,
then, for a moment, in the city ot New York. If
any institution had the power of drawing bills for
all the amounts that were warned, they would regu.
late the evil; but if one half of the demand could
be supplied, some other institution would have to
be resorted to. These bills of exchange would be
subjected, also, to various fluctuations. And how
were these agencies to be supplied with funds? He
knew in the case of a Bank of the United States
what would be the course of things, but conld not
know in the case of an institution like thi«.
Another point to which he would refer was this.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury says
that the plan will enable Government debtors to
pay Government debts. If this weie true, would
it Dot look like giving one cuurrncy to the Govern-
ment, and anoiher io the people—<=ett ng the Re-
presentatives of the Government áo rfn to the & St

REFERENCE OF THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The House resumed the consideration of the
unfinished business of Thursday, being the follow-
ing branch of the resolution heretofore offeretT %
Mr. Fillmore:                                             '      j

referred to the Committee on Manufactures
Which resolution Mr. Athbsto* had heretofore
moved to amend by striking «it tbfe words
"Committee on Manufactures," an| inserting the
words "Committee of Ways and B|eansl"
Which amendment Mr. B.HE«r hjld hereto-
fore moved to amend by adding thaetf the follows
ing words:                                     }   /

And the question being on the amendment to the
amendment—                                f
Mr. WM. C. JOHNSON said he should vote for
the reference of that part of the President's message
now under consideration to the Committee of Way 
and Mean , because he regarded it, under all the
cin omstaT-r^s connected with the subject-fnstter,
anH  thp nub ic exigencies of the country, as the
most appropi n>te committee.   He did not intend to
go m'o a very general d-scus^ion oi the various to-
pics that ha'1 been introduced into «his debate, but
should give briefly the reasons which would con-
trol his cour e rt ¿dim on the subject now pend-
il-  be^re the House.   Had re obtained the-floor
when he fir-t attempted to aa so, at the commerce-
rr.ent o  tne drbate,  *e should  no have detuned
me Hot  e as long a  was i ow necessary.   He saw
ihea that fake issues we>e making; that this subject
was taking a range not calculated to benefit in the
slightest degree the subject-matter before the House.
He shou'd vote for tne reference to the Commit-
tee of Ways and Mean-, for th? reasons given by
'everal gentlemen in tbi-s d.«cuiSion; and had they
given other reasons, which be intended offering, he
thoult have been ideut during the enure debate.
He bad examined the report of the Secretary of
tie Tiea'rtry, and fcund that t>ere was a deficit in
top Ttea-ury greater far than was conceived by
anv member ot this Hou«e at 'he la^t winter's ses-
fot.    He tec. lUcted fn 1 well the discussion had
on  ihi'  flaor at  the  la*t regular session, and the
tone  cf pabli" sentimeiT manifested irom every
qusrter of this ball, ar.d reflected from every por-
rón ct the Union.    At that ses-sion was found but
one sfhtary member who urged a higher protective
tff than a tariff for revenue.   He lecollected^

toen    The Secretary of tbe Treasury had inftrm-
ed itrm that ibere would be a deficit m-the lrea-
surv n-*t year of something like fourteen millions
ot dollar*, which was more than any onehadima-
led or predicted; and he (Mr. J.) helreved that
ft would be nearer twenty millions.   There venue
this year exceeds but little more than half th.s
amount.   Then, on theground of revenue alone-
and no member had yet taken ground against a
fwiff for revenue-it had not yet been demonstrat-
;,, they raised the standard oí revenue to the
neceUry wants of tbe General Government, that
Aw would not necessarily have to give, indirectly,
