Nigh has seriously inconvenienced the public service, and he desires that you will take pains to avoid such an omission in future. When there are no fixed mail arrangements prompt transmission of official documents by officers is highly essential.

I am, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

JAMES B. FRY,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

NASHVILLE, June 17, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY.

Supplies will be at Reynolds', within 10 miles of Pulaski, to-night. Will be very difficult to get them forward from that place, as the reconnoitering expedition of Generals Mitchell, Negley, and Dumont have taken the wagon transportation so far away that I cannot get it in time. General Negley cannot even furnish guard from Columbia.

J. D. BINGHAM,

Captain and Assistant Quartermaster.

ROGERS' GAP, IN POWELL'S VALLEY, TENNESSEE,

June 17, 1862.

Major General D. C. BUELL:

My division is concentrated. I have reliable information that Barton and Kirby Smith, with all their available force, are marching to attack me. If possible have a serious feint made on Chattanooga.

GEORGE W. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General.

CAMP IN POWELL'S VALLEY

June 17, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

Your dispatch* is this moment received. My command has overcome almost insurmountable difficulties and was concentrated on last evening. The men of two brigades are too much broken by fatigue to march to-day.

I hope to attack the enemy early to-morrow morning. My object is to beat the enemy in the field and then take Cumberland Gap. I regret to have caused any inconvenience to General Buell, but I hope that he will cause a strong division to be moved against Chattanooga this morning and to-morrow.

GEORGE W. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Cumberland Gap, June 17, 1862.

Colonel FRY:

If I am to continue offensive operations I must have two regiments of cavalry.

GEORGE W. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General.

(The same to Secretary of War on the 18th.)
