the people of the United States, is upon fit ;
occasions a duty of the highest obligation, ex-
pressed to his fellow-citizens his views and
opinions respecting the measures and proceed-
ings of Congress; and that iu such addresses i
to his fellow-citizens and in such his com- |
munications to Congress he has expressed his j
views, opinions, and judgment of and concern- |
ing th'e actual constitution of the two Houses 1
of Congress without representation therein of i
certain States of the Union, and of the effect |
that in wisdom and justice, in the opinion and
judgment of this respondent, Congress, in its j
legislation and proceedings, should give to this ,
political circumstance; aud whatsoever he has
thus communicated to Congress or addressed
to his fellow-citizens or any assemblage thereof,
this respondent says was and is within and ac-
cording to his right and privilege as an Ameri-
can citizen and his right and duty as President
of the United States.
And this respondent, not waiving or at all
disparaging his right of freedom of opinion
and of freedom of speech, as hereinbefore or
hereinafter more particularly set forth, but
claiming and insisting upon the same, further !
answering the said tenth article, says that the
views and opinions expressed by this respond-
ent in his said addresses to the assemblages
of his fellow-citizens, as in said article or in
this answer thereto mentioned, are not and
were not intended to be other or different from
those expressed by him in his communications
to Congress—that the eleven States lately in
insurrection never had ceased to be States of
the Union, aud that they were then entitled to
representation in Congress by loyal Represen-
tatives and Senators as fully as the other States
of the Union, and that, consequently, the Con-
gress, as then constituted, was not, in fact, a
Congress of all the States, but a Congress of
only a part of the States. This respondent,
always protesting against the unauthorized ex-
clusion therefrom of the said eleven States,
nevertheless gave his assent to all laws passed
by said Congress which did not, in his opinion
and judgment, violate the Constitution, exer-
cising his constitutional authority of returning
bills to said Congress with his objections when
they appeared to him to he unconstitutional or
inexpedient.
And, further, this respondent has also ex-
pressed the opinion, both in his communica-
tions to Congress and in his addresses to the
people, that the policy adopted by Congress
in reference to the States lately in insurrection
did not tend to peace, harmony, and union,
but, on the contrary, did tend to disunion and
the permanent disruption of the States, and
that, in following its said policy, laws had been
passed by Congress in violation of the funda-
mental principles of the Government, and
which tended to consolidation and despotism ;
and, such being his deliberate opinions, he
would have felt himself unmindful of the high
duties of his office if he had failed to express
them in his communications to Congress or in
his addresses to the people when called upon
by them to express his opinions on matters of
public and political consideration.
And this respondent, further answering the
tenth article, says that he has always claimed
and insisted, and now claims and insists, that
both in his personal and private capacity of a
citizen of the United States, and in the politi-
cal relations of the President of the United
States to the people of the United States, whose
servant, underthe duties and reponsibilities of
the Constitution of the United States, the
President of the United States is and should
always remain, this respondent had and has
the full right, and in his office of President of
the United States is held to the high duty,
of forming, and on fit occasions expressing,
opinions of and concerning the legislation of
Congress, proposed or completed, in respect
of its wisdom, expediency, justice, worthiness,
objects, purposes, and public and political
motives and tendencies; and within and as a
part of such right and duty to form, and on
fit occasions to express, opinions of and con-
supplement—2.
cerning the public character and conduct, views,
purposes, objects, motives, and tendencies of
all men engaged in the public son ice, as well
in Congress as otherwise, aud under no other
rules or limits upon this right of freedom of
opinion and of freedom of speech, or of respon-
sibility and amenability lor the actual exercise
of such freedom of opinion and freedom of
speech, than attend upon such rights and their
exercise on the part of all other citizens of the
United States, and on the part of all their
public servants.
And this respondent, further answering
said tenth article, says that the several occa-
sions on which, as is alleged in the several
specifications of said article, this respondent
addressed his fellow-citizens on subjects of
public and political considerations were not,
nor was anyone of them, sought or planned by
this respondent; but, on the coutraiy, each of
said occasions arose upon the exercise of a
lawful and accustomed right of the people of
the United States to call upon their public ser-
vants and express to them their opinions,
wishes, and feelings upon matters of public
and political consideration, and to invite from
such, their public servants, an expression of
their opinions, views, and feelings on matters
of public and political consideration : and this
respondent claims and insists before this honor-
able court, and before all the people of the
United States, that of or concerning this his
right of freedom of opinion and of freedom of
speech, and this his exercise of such rights on
all matters of public and political considera-
tion, and in respect of all public servants or
persons whatsoever engaged in or connected
therewith, this respondent., as a citizen or as
President of the United States, is not subject
to question, inquisition, impeachment, or in-
culpation in any form or manner whatsoever.
And this respondent says that neither the said
tenth article nor any specification thereof nor
any allegation therein contained touches or
relates to any official act or doing of this re-
spondent in the office of President of the Uni-
ted States or in the discharge of any of its
constitutional or legal duties or responsibili-
ties; but said article and the specifications and
allegations thereof, wholly and in every part
thereof, question only the discretion or propri-
ety of freedom of opinion or freedom of speech,
as exercised by this respondent as a citizen of
the United States in his personal right and
capacity, and without allegation or imputation
against this respondent of the violation of any
law of the United States touching or relating
to freedom of speech or its exercise by the
citizens of the United States, or by this re-
spondent as one of the said citizens or other-
wise ; and he denies that by reason of any
matter in said article or its specifications al-
leged he has said or done anything indecent
or unbecoming in the Chief Magistrate of the
United States, or that he has brought the high
office of the President of the United States
into contempt, ridicule, or disgrace, or that he
has committed or has been guilty of a high
misdemeanor in office.
ASSWER TO ARTICLE XI.
And in answer to the eleventh article this
respondent denies that on the 18th day of Au-
gust, in the year 1866, at the city of Washing-
ton, in the District of Columbia, he did, by pub-
lic speech or otherwise, declare or affirm, in sub-
stance or at all, that the Thirty-Ninth Congress
of the United States was not a Congress of the
United States authorized by the Constitution to
exercise legislative power under the same, or
that he did then and there declare or affirm that
the said Thirty-Ninth Congress was a Congress
of only part of the States in any sense or mean-
ing other than that ten States of the Union were
denied representation therein ; or that he made
any or either of the declarations or affirmations
in this behalf, in the said article alleged, as
denying or intending to deny that the legisla-
tion of said Thirty-Ninth Congress was valid
or obligatory upon this respondent, except so
far as this respondent saw fit to approve the
same : and as to the allegation in said article,
that lie did thereby intend or mean to be un-
derstood that lie said Congress had not power
to propose amendments to the Constitution,
tlii-, respondent says that in said addre.-she said
nothing in reference to the subject of amend-
ments of the Constitution, nor was the question
of the competency of the inid Congress to pro-
pose such amendments, without the participa-
tion of said excluded States, at the time of
said address, in any way mentioned or con-
sidered or referred to by this respondent, nor
in what he did say had he any intent regarding
the same, and he denies the allegation so
made to the contrary thereof. But this re-
spondent, in further answer to. and in respect
of, the said allegations of the said eleventh arti-
cle hereinbefore traversed and denied, claims
and insists upon his peisonal and official right
of freedom of opinion and freedom of speech,
and his duly in his political relations as Presi-
dent of the United States to the people of the
United Statesinthe exerciseof sueh freedomof
opinion and freedom of speech, in the same
manner, form, and effect as be lias in this be-
half stated tin* same in his answer to the said
lenth article, and with the same effect as if ho
here repeated the same : and he further claims
and insists, as in said answer to said tenth
article he has claimed and insisted, that he is
not subject to question, inquisition, impeach-
ment, or inculpation, in any form or manner,
of or concerning such rights of freedom of
opinion or freedom of speech or his said
alleged exercise thereof.
And this respondent further denies that, on
the 21st, day of February, in the year 1808, or
at any other time, at the city of Washington,
in the District of Columbia, in pursuance of
any such declaration as is in that behalf in
said eleventh article alleged, or otherwise, he
did unlawfully, and in disregard of the require-
ment of the Constitution that he should take
caie that the laws should be faithfully exe-
cuted, attempt to prevent the execution of an
act entitled "An act regulating the tenure of
certain civil offices," passed March 2, 1807,
by unlawfully devising or contriving, or at-
tempting to devise or contrive, means by which
ho should prevent Edwin M. Stanton from
forthwith resuming the functions of Secretary
for the Department of War ; or by unlawfully
devising or contriving, or attempting to devise
or contrive, means to prevent the execution of
an act entitled "An act making appropriations
for the support of the Army for the fiscal year
ending June t>0, 1808, and for other purposes,"
approved March 2, 1867, or to prevent the
execution of an act entitled "An act to pro-
vide for the more efficient government of the
rebel States," passed March 2, 3807.
And this respondent, further answering the
said eleventh article, says that he has, in his
answer to the first article, set forth in detail
the acts, st eps, and proceedings done and taken
by this respondent to and toward or in the
matter of the suspension or removal of the said
Edwin M. Stanton in or from the office of
Secretary for the Department of War, with the
times, modes, circumstances, intents, views,
purposes, and opinions of official obligation and
duty under and with which such acts, steps,
and proceedings were done and taken; and he
makes answer to this eleventh article of the
matters in his answer to the first article, per-
taining to the suspension or removal of said
Edwin M. Stanton, to the same intentand effect
as if they were here repeated and set forth.
And this respondent, further answering the
said eleventh article, denies that by means or
reason of anything in said article alleged this
respondent, as President of the United States,
did, on the 21st day of February, 1808, or at
any other day or time, commit, or that he was
guilty of, a high misdemeanor in office.
And this respondent, further answering the
. said eleventh article, says that the same and
the matters therein contained do not charge
or allege the commission of any act whatever
by this respondent, in his office of President
of the United States, nor the omission by this,
