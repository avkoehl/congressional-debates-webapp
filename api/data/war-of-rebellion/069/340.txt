gade over to that to clear the enemy's cavalry away. If General Burnside comes south of the Totopotomoy, I should have abundant force to take possession of that road myself. General Sheridan's cavalry is I believe lying in the vicinity of New Castle Ferry.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 2.30 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have learned from my officers that the left of the Second Corps does reach the Totopotomoy, and that a division of the Ninth Corps is about to cross to the south side in that vicinity. We have taken 6 more prisoners from Rodes' division. The cavalry now connect down the road from Linney's to Machanicsville. The artillery firing here is mine. No line of battle has yet been encountered; I am going out to the front. Have you any instructions? My advance has passed General Burnside's skirmishers on my right.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 30, 1864 - 2.40 p. m.

Major-General WARREN:

I transmitted your dispatch of 2.30 p. m. General Meade, at Hancock's headquarters. If he has any reply to make to you I shall receive it in ten minutes. I suppose there can be none your intended position and the modifications that changes in Burnside's may produce are understood from your previous dispatches.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

HANCOCK'S HEADQUARTERS,

May 30, 1864 - 2.40 [p. m.]

Major-General WARREN:

Your dispatch of 2.30 received. No other instructions than those given you last night can be given till you disclose the position of the enemy. Burnside reports he has one division in position between you and Griffin. I understand, however, only a brigade of that division was required for this purpose. I send you a copy* of instruction sent to Burnside, for your information. If, on examination, you think it expedition to attack the enemy you can do so. Hancock's front is strongly held by them, and it would not seem probable that much can be done here. Such of Burnside's force not in the line or wanted to fill any gap you may make can be used to aid you.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
