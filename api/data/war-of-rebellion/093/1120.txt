HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Four Miles East of Columbia, November 28, 1864 - 12.30 p. m.

Brigadier General EDWARD HATCH,

Commanding Fifth Division, Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: If the Twelfth Tennessee has not reported, send a staff officer up the Franklin pike till he meets it, and order it to join you without further delay. It is understood that it has been stopped to establish a courier-line; this is unnecessary, as the line is already established. Direct Colonel Stewart or the commanding officer of the brigade who went to Knob Gap to guard the telegraph line as far as Thompson's Station, by sending small patrols along it once or twice a day. The commanding officer of the Twelfth Missouri complains that his command is badly broken down; I observed, however, that his horsed were able to trot through deep mud. Direct the commanding officer of his brigade to give him every assistance in seizing horses for his dismounted men. The practice of trotting and galloping horses must be discontinued; issue stringent orders in regard thereto, and see that they are obeyed.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding Cavalry Corps.

COLONEL: Move to the Franklin and Lewisburg pike, traveling east till you strike it; don't halt till you reach me. This is General Schofield's order. If you see General Hammond, communicate this order to him; move together and under his command.
