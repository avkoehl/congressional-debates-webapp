COMMANDING OFFICER GROVER'S BRIGADE,

Near Muddy Creek:

The following, just received, is furnished for your information:
HEADQUARTERS HARPER'S FERRY.

General AMBROSE E. BURNSIDE:

A boy, about twelve years of age, who was captured four months ago with some of the Fifth New York Cavalry, and has since been living near Berryville, has just come into our camp. He left Berryville last night. Says Stuart's and Munford's cavalry were there, and were cooking three days' rations. He heard an officer say they were going into Loudoun Valley, to make a raid in rear of McClellan's army, and that an infantry and artillery force was to move against this place, to hold it in check. He reports that Jackson was at Winchester, and a portion of Hill's command at Berryville. This report is corroborated by two negroes, who came in to-day. I have no cavalry here.

H. W. SLOCUM,The major-general commanding directs that you keep your command on the alert, to prevent surprise.

Respectfully,

CHAUNCEY McKEEVER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major-General COX:

The enemy have not advanced to-day. They are reported to occupy all the roads leading west and north from Winchester as far as Big Cacapon Bridge and Pughtown. Milroy reports he is on the way to me. If he gets here in time, we will take care of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Jackson too.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

(Received Charleston, November 14, 1862.)

Major-General COX:

Your dispatch received. I cannot believe that Kelley is correct in his conjectures as to Jackson's movements; still, it would be proper to prepare against them. I think there are no regiments in Ohio ready for the field, and I will, therefore, stop Morgan's movements, if not already too late. I do not think he has yet left Gallipolis. Inform me of any information you may get regarding Jackson's further movements; that already furnished has been sent to Halleck.

Major-General, Commanding.
