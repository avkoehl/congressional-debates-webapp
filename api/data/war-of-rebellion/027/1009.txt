Numbers 288. Report of Captain W. T Poague, commanding Rockbridge Artillery, of the battle of Sharpsburg.

SEPTEMBER 22, 1862.

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the battery under my command in the battle of Sharpsburg:

On the evening of the 16th, the battery-consisting of three guns, two 10-pounder Parrotts and one napoleon, the 6-pounder being on detached service-by order of General Jackson, was placed in position on or near the extreme left of our lines, supported by the First and Second Brigades In a few minutes a battery of the enemy opened fire at about 500 or 600 yards on one of our batteries on the right of the road, which had been engaged in shelling the woods occupied by the enemy's infantry. Upon this battery, fire was opened, and in about twenty minutes it was silenced, our own battery on the right of the road in the mean time having retired. In this affair we were assisted by one gun of some unknown battery.

About 8 p. m. I was ordered to withdraw my guns a short distance in rear of the infantry, and to resume the same position by daylight next morning.

At my request my two Parrott pieces were replaced next morning by two howitzers from Captain Raine's battery. Owing to the nature of the ground, the range was short, and I wished to economize my Parrott ammunition.

Shortly after daylight on the morning of the 17th, the enemy's infantry commenced advancing. The 12-pounder, under Lieutenant [William M.] Brown, in conjunction with Captain Raine's howitzers, opened upon them, and after firing several rounds, and finding themselves within range of the enemy's skirmishers, retired to a position in rear of our infantry, from which they fired until compelled by the musketry of the enemy again to fall back; and there being no other position from which enemy could be reached, they joined their respective batteries. The place occupied by my battery during the night becoming exposed
