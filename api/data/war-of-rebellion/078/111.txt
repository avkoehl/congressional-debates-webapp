CAMP NELSON, June 13, 1864-10. 10 a. m.

Captain DICKSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Report just received from cavalry says rebels are making for mouth of Paint Lick, and are now crossing river. Some of them will, no doubt, be stopped on this side. With forge sent from Lexington and from this camp, I think of the rascals will be caught.

S. S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.

CAMP NELSON, June 13, 1864.

Captain DICKSON:

Courier just in, with dispatch from party sent out this morning, report rebels across river moving toward Richmond. They move very rapidly; seem anxious to get away.

Brigadier-General.

CAMP NELSON, June 13, 1864.

Captain J. BATES DICKSON:

Some of our scouts have just come in; they part seeing the rebels crossing seven miles east of Lancaster, going toward Crab Orchard or Stanford. Our forces are still in pursuit. Colonel Weatherford has gone toward Stanford with 300 men. The rebels are reported nearly worn out, both men and horses. I hope our forces will overtake them to-night.

S. S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.

CAMP NELSON, June 13, 1864.

Captain J. B. DICKSON;

Rebels in Lancaster at 2 p. m. This I think reliable. Our men in pursuit, in hopes they will overtake them to-night. Rebels and their stock much worn down. Many of them arrived with nothing but revolvers. Would it not be best to keep them divided? We have every main in pursuit that could be mounted and armed. Don't see how they could get to Mount Sterling, but if it is thought best will send courier and order them to that place.

S. S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.

CAMP NELSON, June 13, 1864.

Captain J. BATES DICKSON:

Giltner's forces crossed pike between this and Nicholasville a few minutes since, going east. Our picket brought in one prisoner, but he appears to be very ignorant. Can't get much out of him that is reliable; he thinks Giltner has 1,500 men.

S. S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.
