rolled Bills, made a report.
_ The SPEAKER announced the unfinished bu-
siness to be the river and harbor bill.
Mr. BAYLY asked the general consent of the
House to submit a motion, that a communication
from the Navy Department in relation to the ships
St. Lawrence and New York, be referred lo the
Committee on Naval Affairs, and be printed.
The SPEAKER said there was no such commu-
nication before the House.
Mr. BAYLY said it was a communication which
had been returned some time since.
The motion was entertained and agreed to.
The SPEAKER, by consent, laid before the
•House a letter from the Secretary of War, trans-
mitting, in answer to a resolution of the House of
the 99th of January, 1845, a report of Captain J.

northwest; which letter and report were laid upon
the table.

And the question, "Shall thiuitom brcngro.-iHed?"
was taken.
When the Clerk had called the roll—
Mr. RHETT rose and addressed the Chair.
The SPEAKER put the usual question, " Was
the gentleman within the bar when his name was
called ?"
Mr. RHETT was understood to nay, lie was
not quite certain of the fact; but that as this ww an
appropriation for Charleston harbor, ho ht>|ted I he
House would allow him to record his vote.
No objection having been uuulo—
The Clerk called the name of 11. Baknwki.i.
Rhett, who, (voting under a misapprehension of
she form of the question,) said " Ay."
Much merriment ensued.
Mr. RHETT (being apprised of the error) said,
" I thought the question was on striking out the
item. If, as 1 now understand, it is on cnivuissiiig
it, I vote ' No.' "
