and others. Says he is a through Union man. Says Gunnoe's brother who was killed by Spriggs and Rector was a Union man and was supposed to be killed by mistake, the design being to kill Hunter, a secessionist. Says Gregory who procured the pass for Gunnoe to go to Maryland is now provost marshal of the United States at Hancock. Says Gunnoe was regarded as a harmless, inoffensive man before these difficulties, and his chief fault is his devoltion to the Stars and Stripes and being the dupe of the mischievous men who hae brought the enemy into that country. I think this man ought not to be released.

E. E. Hughes. - Born in Rockbridge County, Va. ; learned the carpenter's trade; lived two years in the South; visited his mother and removed to Iowa in 1850. Owns a farm which with the stock is worth $7,000; deeded it to his mother. Having heard the people in Virginia were in great he came to Virginia to take care of his mother. Crossed the Ohio into Cabell County. Got directions from Southern men who to get through the country. Started to go through but was arrested in Logan County. Says he is unwilling to take the oath of allegiance because he might lose his property. This man is candid and honest. If he had taken the oath I would have recommend his release. I must advise he be held as an allien enemy prisoner.

C. Rodman. - Born in Rhode Island; came to Virginia in May last. His examination corresponds closely with a letter herewith inclosed*. He refuses to take the oath of allegiance. I think this man liable to be held as a prisoner and I do not see how mercy can be extended to him. But in consideration of his good conduct I should be pleased to see him exchanged as soon as the enemy will exchange.

Caleb N. Stevenson. - Born in Cabell County, Va., now Wayne; lives six miles and a half form Guyandotte. Was arrested by Captain Vincent Witcher's company; for what he does not know. Voted for the Union because he was told it would keep war our of Virginia, but when Virginia went out of the Union he went with her. Had nothing to do with the Northern army or their friends. Staid close at home to keep out of their way. Ready to take the oath of allegiance. Mr. Laidly, delegate from Cabell, says prisoner is an ignorant, obscure man, but honest, and has kept himself very quiet in the distrubances in that county. Says Captain Witcher's company is one of independent scouts and are supposed to be indiscriminate in their arrests. I recommend this man be discharged on taking the oath of allegiance.

William A. Dolby. - Eighteen years old; born in Hardy County; lives on Petterson's Creek. Says his father is a Union man. He is secessionist. A man named Michael, his cousin, was killed by the militia of Hardy. His father was much enraged and compelled him to join the Union guard under D. Shell. Says his father threatened to turn him away from home if he did not join. He is cirppled in his hip and shoulder, and feared he could not make a living. He joined the guard and had musket given him. The article signed by him only bound him to defend property from maruaders not belonging to either army. Would not have joined the guard if he had been required to make war on the South. He is just out of the hospital and has a bad cough. I believe this young man's story, but as he was taken with arms in his
