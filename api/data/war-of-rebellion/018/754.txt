I think he ranks you, but his command was the only one available for the purpose.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

McCLELLAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

August 30, [1862]-7.40 p.m.

General BARNARD:

I can spare as many 30-pounder Parrotts, I think, as you desire; but it will be impossible for me to send guns anywhere. I have been waiting several days without being able to get transportation for guns into the works I occupy.

R. O. TYLER,

Colonel, &amp;c.

CAMP NEAR ALEXANDRIA,

August 30, 1862.

Brigadier General JAMES S. WADSWORTH,

Military Govern, Washington:

In the absence of orders defining the limits of his command, General McClellan issues a countersign to-day to the troops of the Army of the Potomac in this vicinity. It is "Malvern." If yours is different he will be obliged to you to communicate it. Instruct the guards at the Long Bridge to recognize ours.

Do you know what command furnishes the guard for the Virginia end of the Long Bridge?

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NEAR BROAD RUN, August 30, 1862-11.45 p.m.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

It is represented to me that the engagement yesterday evening was very severe, but successful for our arms. Another engagement occurred this afternoon, but I have not yet learned the result.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General.

AUGUST 30, 1862-9.30 a.m.

Colonel SCHRIVER, Chief of Staff:

My two brigades are now under heavy batteries of the enemy. We require at least six heavy Parrott guns and the rest of the division, as this seems to be the point of attack. We must have assistance. The ground has been pointed out to me by General Kearny. My advance brigade is engaged and I have no support.

Very respectfully,

JAMES B. RICKETTS,

Brigadier-General Volunteers.
