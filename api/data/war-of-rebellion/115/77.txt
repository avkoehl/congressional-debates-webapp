With the assurance that I am exceedingly sorry to trouble you at this time and that my excuse for so doing is that I write from motives of humanity and in the discharge of a duty I owe to a person held in imprisonment, I remain with great respect, very truly, &amp;c.,

E. W. STOUGHTON.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, September 24, 1861.

Right Honorable Lord LYONS, &C.

MY LORD: In reply to the inquiries in your reminder of the 23rd instant* I have to inform your lordship that General Dix' reply to my inquiries concerning Patrick Crohan and Dennis Kelly has not yet been received. I shall again call General Dix's attention to the matter to-day. Meantime Consul Archibald will be permitted to visit Dennis Kelly.

As to the case of the person named Walsh also mentioned in your lordship's memorandum I can only say that the fact that he was a British subject could not have been known to the military police who were engaged in suppressing the insurrectionary proceedings in which he was engaged, and that even if it had been I cannot regard his complaint as entitled to consideration when his associations with insurgents and their badges found on his person provoked the severities with which he was visited-severities no greater in his case than those treated and which neither in his nor in theirs were carried beyond the necessities of the occasion.

I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to your lordship the assurance of my night consideration.

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, September 24, 1861.

Colonel G. LOOMIS, Fort Columbus, New York Harbor, N. Y.

COLONEL: I have to request that you will give Edward M. Archibald esq., Her Britannic Majesty's consul at New York, permission to visit Dennis Kelly, a British subject now confined at Fort Columbus, New York Harbor.

I am, colonel, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.
