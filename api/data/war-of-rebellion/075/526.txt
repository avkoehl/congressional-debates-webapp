rocky, is impassable for artillery and trains. Behind the hill is a cornfield where a horse mires to his belly. The enemy had strong works. Prisoners from Cleburne's division say they have only fallen back a little on their left. My reconnoitering party will push on as far as possible toward Marietta.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, TWENTIETH CORPS,June 19, 1864-4.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel PERKINS, Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: The enemy are moving artillery and infantry to my right; one battery, no report yet as to amount of infantry. Most of their firing is from my right. I have advanced about a mile in the direction indicated; have halted to rectify lines and cover my right; shall push on again in a few moments.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,June 19, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel PERKINS, Assistant Adjutant-General:

I am satisfied that the enemy have better troops and more of them on my right than on my front. About dusk my skirmishers were driven in on my right front a very little by getting on the flank of my skirmish line.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, TWENTIETH CORPS,June 19, 1864-11 p. m.

Major-General HOOKER:

GENERAL: One rebel, mortally wounded, reports Cheatham's division in front of us. A force of about 2,000 are as seen on our right flank by a captain of sharpshooters, Seventy-ninth Ohio. A force advanced to drive in our pickets on the right front, saying: "Let's drive in the damned Yanks, and not let them fortify to-night." The Spencer rifle sharpshooters of Seventy-ninth Ohio, one company, opened briskly on them and checked their advance. My loss has been about 30 in killed and wounded. I cannot understand how the force should be on my right, if they are retreating. Brisk skirmishing is going on my picket-line. The enemy we heard plainly fortifying. There seems to be a gap on my left between Geary and myself. I have sent to slash the timber in there, between my left and the creek, where his right rests, or was to rest. The right of my line is refused almost at right angles to the ridge I pointed to you where I should place Colonel Coburn.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.
