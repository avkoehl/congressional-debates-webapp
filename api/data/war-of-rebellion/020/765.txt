CHARLESTON, S. C., February 4, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

Good information says Federal officers boast they will test relative value of iron and brick walls early this month, soon as they shall have eight or ten iron-clads South. They report seven within reach of point of destination, meaning probably Charleston. Result at Genesis Point is encouraging. Volleys only should be fired against turrets. Am putting Rains torpedoes in every direction. I require more heavy guns for interior line of works.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.

CHARLESTON, S. C.., February 4, 1863.

H. W. MERCER, Brigadier-General, Savannah, Ga.:

Monitors can only be injured by weight of metal striking them; hence necessity of firing bolts, if practicable, and by volleys. Look out Isle Hope does not change its name. How is Causeway Battery and one on Rosedew Island? Organize your siege train soon as possible.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CHARLESTON, February 4, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON, Secretary of War:

Had already telegraphed Governor Bonham to keep reserves thirty days longer.

General Branch [French?] telegraphs me as follows:

Thirty transports sailed south on 30th from Beaufort, N. C. Many transports still in that harbor, with artillery and horses embarked.

On the 31st, gunboats sailed. It is evident they are intended for Charleston or Savannah, probably the latter. Owing to recent demonstrations in that quarter I must again request services of General Wayne, Georgia, or other competent brigadier-general.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

[Indorsement Numbers 1.]

Commended to the attention of the President, especially in reference to the request for another brigadier.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary.

[Indorsement Numbers 2.]

Who is General Branch? Who is Brigadier-General Wayne? Is General Lawton for duty? Is there anything known of General Gardner? Where is Ex-Brigadier General W. H. T. Walker? Is he candidate for appointment?

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
