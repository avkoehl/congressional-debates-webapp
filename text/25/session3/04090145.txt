statesman it s pot the view which a Senator,
charged with the duties of legislation, should ever
take lie shju'd look more at the nature than at
the amoutt of th  tax—moie &* its effects upon the
communty than at its tribute to the Treasury
He should consider what effect it has on the busi-
ness oflife, on the pursuits of industry, on the
great avocation of the agriculturist and the manu-
facturer, he should look at it under these com
prehensive aspects, and, if found prejudicial to
these great interests, the tax should be abolished,
whether great or small Tried in this way, and
this tax must cease—not merely be reduced, but
cease entirely
EXPENDITURLa OF THE GO\ ERVMENT
SPEECH OF HON. J   L. MURRAY,
OP KENTUCKY,
In the House of Representatives,
Januanj 31, 1839,
On   the Army Appropriation  bill, (the  House
being in the Committeeof the Whole ) pending
the amendment of Mr Mason, of Virginia, to
increase the Hem for National Armories from
$300,000 to $360,000, the amount in foimer
years
Mi MURRAY commenced by observing that
lie had intended, for some days, to occupy the
ñist suitable occasion with a very brief leview
and examination of the ex; enduures generally of
the Government He had felt the more anxious
*o do so sir ce the verv able and excellent report
of the Committee of Ways and Means had been
published-—a document which appealed to him to
tie so obviously correct in all its financial sugge-,
tion«, that he sincerely hoped it would lece vt, the
imquahfie 1 suppoit oí at least eveiy Inend of the
Administration lie was against theamendment
pioposed to the bill under consideration The
Committee of Ways ai d Mean , by whom the
tnll was reported to the House, had chaige of the
public service, and knew better than the House
could know the amount of money necessary to be
appropriated for its support He warned gentle
men, friendly to the Admmistiation particularly,
to -beware of appropriating more money than was
recommended by the committee, lest they might
render themselves obnoxious, in a greater or less
degree, to the reiteiated charge of extravagance
with which their ears had, almost without inter-
mission, been saluted since the commencement ot
the present Congress These charges, as far as he
knew, or believed, were made and lepeated with
out justifiable cause, and he thought they tteie
so considered by the country, and it therefore
behooved those gentlemen with whom he had
acted heretofore, not to put weapons in the hands
of those whose business and policy it was to use
them to the best advantage He was willing that
Opposition members should, in a fair manner,
make the best of their case, but as every wall had
two side  to it, one to cover the defense, as we 1
as one to breast the onset, it was the duty of those
an defense to vigilantly guaid against the making
of any breach sufficiently vulnerable to admit the
enemy For one, he was not afiaid of any in¡uiy
resulting to the cause of the Administration from
the charges which had been preferred by the Op
position The disproportion was so great be-
tween the charges, and the alleged grounds upon
which they were sought to be based,that their very
violence disarmed them of the harm intended by
those who fulminated them They had been too
indiscriminate in their character, involving merit
as well as demerit, and innocence alike with guilt,
to have the effect intended upon a discerning and
disinterested public He thought there was more
danger of the satiety of public inquiry, fiom be
nig ted on political food, which is generally eitner
bitter or distasteful, so much so as to threaten a
disrelish in future, to such as might be necessary
to the health, or inviting to the appetite, of the
body politic Sir, (said Mr M.,) 1 do not eay so
merely to piay upon words, but would earnestly
ask if the course pursued by the party here, who
wage and keep up an indiscriminate warfare
against the Administration, is not well calculated
to destroy the wholesome effect of well merited
No. 10
t exposure of the pauy in power, whenever their '
I official conduct may be such as to merit exposure > '
i Sir, there was mucn in the suggestion of thegen-
' tleman from New Hampshire, [Mr Atherton,]
the other day, that the terms corruption, conup-
non,¿.c , had been so long and incessantly re-
peated here, without meaning, and without found-
ation, that they had ceased to have effect on the ¡
public ear, by which they were little more regarded
than if uttered by a starling, taught to lepeat them
day after day, without being conscious of their
impoit     And this  must necessarily continue to
be the case so long as the people see that the chief
object of gentlemen heie is to obtain in their re-
searches food for invective, rather than truth to
enlighten the public mind     That their object is
to piocure, m advance, the condemnation of the
Administration, rather than to give it a fair trial
be ore the country      I hat their object is not to
do justice to those " jn power," as th<>y so de-
nominate them,  but  to  eject them  from  their
places, whether just or unjust    That they seldom
spare e ther the  national honor, or the  national
faith, when, by so doing, those who administer
I the  Government  are   likely to  merit or receive
commendation, and that their object, in fine, is j
more to advance their own political prospects '
I than the good of the country    A political course, '
. so notoriously unfair, is much  to  be deprecated
by every friend of a just responsibility on the part
I of those in power   áuch responsibility is the chief
security we can have against the misconduct of
our public officers, and nothing is more likely to
destroy it than a continual indiscriminate attack
upon those officers, without reference to the merit
or  demerit of their  official   actions,   the  attack
beinff no less virulent v,hen unfounded than whpn
elicited   by palpable  viola'ions  of  public  duty
The greatest sensinlity becomes blunted and de
I stroyed by overartion, and  thus it is with the
public watchfulness wluch, if we may credit gen-
tlemen, has already become reprehersibly cire-
less, betraying no unusual emotions or symptoms
of alarm, at any cnarge, however grave, though
I thundered forth in the usual manner,                        ,
I        " With n thousand mouths, a ihousind tongue*,           I
And ihroat of brass inspired with iron lungR "           j
And hence it is that gentleman who are always
sounding the tocsin of alarm, and who piously
I " pray without ceasing" for their "kingdom come
on earth," are generally rewarded with the great-
est indiffeience on the part of the people This
may be seen in the history of the late elections,
as given by the gentleman fiom Ohio, [Mr Dun-
can } in the most recent of his published works
on that and other subjects, from which he showed
us, some days since, that the previous anticipa-
tions of the Opposition had been most woefully
overthrown, notwithstanding the warnings, the
ragings, and wmlmgs of the two last sessions of
this Congiess, which were not for one moment
permuted to ool on the public ear Th s is ab-
solutely insufferable It is past all endurance,
that so much labor, and zeal, and noise should
vanish into " thin air "
I " Is it for this you g-nn ttio o mciger looks
'          And sacrifice \our dinner for your books'"
' What is the cause of such indifference5 It is
that the cry of coriuption, extravagance, &e , m
j this House is not supposed to furnish much evi-
I dence of its existence It is that panics are
j ceasing to have their wonted effect, and because
| the people have heretofore so often been start"d
by the vexatious cry of wolf, when no cause of
, alarm was to be seen or felt
One oí tne standing charges against the Admin-
istration is that of extravagance in the expendí
tures of the public money, and of all the charges
made, it is perhaps the most plausible when
addressed to those who are ignorant of the many
items of which the aggregate of the annual ex-
penditure is composed. The charge seems to be
founded mainly on the difference between the
amount of the annual expenditure under Mr
Adams's administration, and the expenditures of
the last few years under General Jackson and
Mr Van Buren Tiom the table of annual ex-
penditures, wh ch Í shall hereaiter submit, (said
Mi M ,) the difference would seem to be con
siderable, and when weiecur to the amount alone
of the money expended, without reference to the
I objects to which it has been applied, or with an
entire ignorance of those objects, an impression
is left on our minds which vanishes on explana-
tion.
Before proceeding to examine the manner m
which large amounts of money have been expended
within the last few years, it may not be amiss
(said Mr M ) to premise that the mere circum-
stance of the expenditure of a large amount of
money is not itself evidence of extravagance or
wastefulness Extravagance does not consist m
the amount expended, but depends on the means,
the manner, or the objects of expenditure One
of the sayings of D" Franklin's Poor Richard is,
that " he that buys an article which he does not
need, because it is cheap, pays very dear for it "
And thus it is we often see large amounts of money
invested or paid out which may be said to be well,
and even economically eypended A man who
gives a dollar for a cane he does not need, has been
extravagant to the amount of a dollar, wmlst he
that gives five, ten, or twenty thousand dollars for
a valuable farm, worth as much or more than the
amount given, cannot be said to be extravagant
The same rule is good when applied to the Gov-
ernment There may be much economyand good
policy, too, m the application of a hundred thou-
sand or a million of dollars, and there may be great
extravagance in the expenditure of one hundred
I should also premise that withm the last ten years
there has been a vast increase in the territory, the
improvements, the business, the Wealth, and the
population of the United States, and consequently
a corresponding increase m the amount of expend-
iture has become necessary Nor should we forget
that with the growth of the country, the means of
expenditure have increased The number of post
offices in the United States, m 1828, was 7,651
The number on the 1st of December, 1838, was
19,533 In 1828, the number of miles of transpor-
tation of the United States mail, was 10,100,240
This is increased to 34,580,202 miles in 1838
These facts, of themselves, speak volumes They
also bear witness of the faithful and energetic man-
ner in which this Department has been adminis-
tered by its present able and enlightened head All
must accc-d him the greatest credit, when we
compare its conditron now with that in which he
found it, and reflect that since his appointment he
has, in its management, brought order out of con-
fusion, and redeemed it from a large debt with
which it was incumbered, without the aid of any
extraneous resources In 1825 theaggregate Value
of our imports and exports was f 195,815,000 This
nmountwaa swelled against 1836 to $318,643,000.
During the past year, 1838, our imports amounted
to $112,000,000, and our exports to $103,136,009
It is estimated that fifty per cent may be addeá
for the year ending September 30, 1839, which
will make the former $168 000,-000, and the latter
$154,704,000 Our tonnage, American and foreign,
entered from abroad in 1828, was 1,018,604 In
1837 it was 2 065 423 In 1825-'26, the produc-
tions of the great valley of the Ohio and Mississippi
rivers, which were transported to the New Orleans
market, amounted in value to some eight or nine
millions dollars In 1838, they amounted to
§25,000,000 There is, besides, a large portion of
these productions sent to other markets than New
Orleans The valuable live stock of Upper Ken-
tucky, consisting of horses, beef cattle, mules, and
hogs, is generally driven to the South, whilst a
large amount of provisions from the States nortk
if the Ohio river is transported to the North and
East by the way of the lakes and New York
canals In 183Í the number of tons that passed
through the Louisville canal was 76 323, and the
amount of tolls collected $12,750 In 1837 the
number of tons had increased to 242,374, and the
amount of tolls to §145,424 The amount of tolls
collected on the New Yo-k canals m 1828, was
#838 444, which .ncreased to $1,293,123 in 1837
The number of steamboats on the western waters
m 1826, amounted only to a few dozen, and the
fiat and keel boats to a few thousand In 1837
the former numbered 638, and gave employment
to 15 950 hands The latter numbered 6 000, and
furnished employment to 25,000 or 30 000 hands
A still greater increase has taken place on the north-
ern lakes, and a corresponding- one in many other
places m the Union    At the last census (1830)
