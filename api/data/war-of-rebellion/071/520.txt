Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I have just received the following from Colonel Clendenin:

If I had Delaware cavalry now could use them to advantage. The cavalry that was at Point of Rocks is reported falling back on Frederick. Rebels reported crossing at Point of Rocks, 400 strong. My cavalry are moving out and will ascertain. I think they are rebel this time.

I have sent the First Delaware Cavalry to Clendenin. I had directed Clendenin to move in the direction of Emmitsburg, in obedience to your recent order, but have now countermanded the order until Clendenin reports again. I have a force of cavalry patrolling the roads from Liberty, through Middleburg, and as far up as Hanover, and get reports by telegraph via Westminster.

Thirty cavalry have fallen back from the Potomac. They had a skirmish with the enemy and report losing 20 men. I fear the down trains is captured, as lieutenant reports having heard the whistle. I am ready for the rebels.
