Colonel J. M. CHIVINGTON,

Commanding District of Colorado:

COLONEL: I have received information from Brigadier-General Carleton that a rebel force from Texas is threatening a movement into the Department of New Mexico, and that it may be necessary that he should be re-enforced very suddenly. You will, therefore, please hold yourself in readiness to render him any assistance in your power, should it become necessary; and, if called upon, you may move, with such of your command as may be spared without jeopardizing your own district, to General Carleton's assistance, subject to his orders, and without waiting for further orders from these headquarters, reporting, however, anything of the kind you may do. In this matter you are to exercise your own discretion, however, as to the necessities of your own district.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
