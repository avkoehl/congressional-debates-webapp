The enemy crossed the Etowah near Stilesborough. We moved in this direction to intercept him and oppose his farther progress. Our cavalry have not ascertained definitely the route of his main body. The only infantry prisoner taken to-day shows Hooker opposite our right. Wheeler beat a brigade of cavalry at Cass Station yesterday. Captured 250 loaded wagons, brought off 80, and burned the rest. He brought in 158 prisoners.
