HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, December 16, 1864-4.45 p.m.

(Sent 5 p.m.)

Brigadier-General RAWLINS:

Your dispatch of 4.0 just received. There is nothing to indicate a movement on the part of the enemy. They opened this p.m. on the Ninth Corps front with a heavy gun, to which our batteries have been replying. This would have been reported if I did not presume you would construe my silence as indicative that all was right.
