clearly the receipts and expenditures (except the
original purchase money) for said lands so pur-
chased by the United States to the day aforesaid,
also, similar information concerning the lands em-
braced in the Florida purchase.
Mr JOHN a  ADAMS submitted the follow-
ing resolution, which lies one day on the tabl«
Resolved, That the President of the United States
be" requested to cause to be laid before this House,
if not .nconsistentwith the public interest, a copy
of the instructions of Richard Rush, Envoy Ex-
traordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the
Court of Great Britain, of the 6th of November,
1817, and also a copy of the instructions referred
to 11 his message of the 6 h ms ant, forbidding
all the ministers and agents of the United States
abroad to accept in future, unless previously au-
thorized by Congress, presents of any description,
from any foreign State, under any circumstances
THE PENSION LAWS.
The order of the day was then declared to be
the resolution of Mr Chilton, to appoint a select
committee to inquire into the expediency of so
extending the general pension law, as to embrace
■nithin ns piovisions those person's who were en-
gaged in the Indian wars down to the year 1794,
and the amendment of it, by Mr Booldih, to
appoint a committee to inquire into the moral
effects of thepension system upon the community,
and how fai it ought to be abolished or repealed
Mi PEYTON rose and said, Mr Speaker, I
intended to have made my acknowledgments to
the honorable gentleman from Rhode Island, [Mr
Eurges,] for a kindness which others have so
often received at his hands before But, sir,
that gentleman is not in his seat—he was not .
there yesterday morning—and I have no remarks
to make The absent and the dead—nature's bourne I
and ocean's waves, alike with me, afford a sacred
shield                                                                             |
Mr HARDIN said he did not understand the
history of the Indian wais in the manner in which ]
it was understood by the gentleman from Rhode
Island Those wais were the most desperate and
bloody which hiatoiy recorded, and continued,
without intermission, from 1778 to 1794 He
went into a recital of some of tne principal events
of those wars, and allowed that they weie con-
nected with the war of the Revolution, and grew
out of the hostility of the Indian allies of Great
Britain
These were not the petty conflicts which the
gentleman from Rhode Island supposed them to
be. Mr H passed a high eulogium on the char-
acter of the Kentucky militia, as exhibited in the
Indian wars and during the late Wai with Great
Britain When the Governor of Rhode Island,
with an army of fifteen men, was hesitating whethei
he could const tutional'y take the field or not, the
venerable Governor of Kentucky was fac ng the
enemy with two thousand of the bravest and
best of the sons of Kentucky no constitutional
sciuples were felt there The gentleman from
Rhode Island deemed it a reproach to take the
spoils of his vanquished foe. He had taken the
idea from the story of Ajax and Ulysses, but had
forgotten the part which best applied to the case
Ihe Grecian generals awarded the aims to Ulys
ses, and left the old vaunting chief m mortification
anddespair Mr H greatly íegietted thatthissub-
ject should be attemp'ed to be turned in o ridicule
The people of the West have as strong claims to
pensions as any jn America He repeated, that
they bore a part in the revolutionaiy wai, and
were entitled to the same consideration with those
who fought on the east side of the mountains The
gentleman from South Carolina [Mr Pinckney]
contended that the w hole pension system was un
constitutional Was it unconstitutioral to pay
men who aie engaged in the land and naval ser
vice of the United States' If they aie wounded in
service, is it unconstitutional to pension them > If
they die in service, is it unconstitutional to give
half pay for five or ten years to their widows'
Certainly not, and for the same reasons it is not
unconstitutional to pension those who have ren-
dered military services The military pension
system was dictated bysound national policy He
would never pension officers who weie engaged
in civil service When a man u> ordered to storm
a battery or scale a foit, if he knows that it is
unconstitu tional for the Govei nment to provide for
his wife and family, if he falls, or for himself, if
he is wounded, his courage and ardor are damped.
But if the Government says to him, Go on, we
will be a father to your family, and take care of
you, he has no longer any hesitation, and braves
death without dismay He hoped never to see
the time when we should be such sticklers for the
Constitution that we could do nothing of a useful
or practical kind Some remarks had been made
as to the probable number of the persons who
would be entitled to pensions under the proposed
measure The number of those engaged at dif-
ferent times in the wars witn the Indians did not
exceed twenty thousand, and of these not more
than three or five thousand could now be alive,
but this was a subject proper for the inquiry of a
committee
A message was received from the Senate inform-
ing the House that the Senate adhered  to their
amendment to the bill making appropriations, in
part, for the support of the Government
EEMOVAL OF THE DEPOSITES.
The House resumed the consideiation of the
motion to refer the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury on the deposites to the Committee of
Ways and  Means—the question  being on the
amendment submitted by Mi Jones, as an amend-
ment to that previously submitted oy Mi  McDtir-
fie, viz   to add to the motion for reference the
following instructions to that committee   " In-
' quire into the expediency of depositing the rev-
' enue hereafter collected in the State banks in the
' different States, where the same is collected, in
' propoition to theirlespective capitals paid in, and
' to prescribe the terms on which the same shall be
' deposited, and to reoort by bill or otherwise "
Mr JONFS, of Georgia, resumed his remaiks
He read some extiacts from the speech of Mr
Clay against the recharter of the old bank, show-
ing that Mr  Clay was satisfied that the charges
made against the old bank of abuse of power, and
oppressive conduct, had been fanly made out
Whether the bank was obnoxious to these charges
was not now the question, but there was sufficient
proof of their truth to satisfy the honoiable mem-
ber, whose remarks he had read     Mr  J  then
passed to the manner in which the transfer drafts
weie made, and expressed the opinion that the
Secretary of the Treasury ought to have apprised
the bank of the existence of the drafts, in the
weekly lists, and to have stated the contingency
upon which they would be presented
From the circumstances of the times—the pay-
ment of duties m cash, the transfers, and thecur-
tailments of discounts made by the banks—great
distress had befallen the community It was his
opinion that the removal of the deposites ought to
have been made at an earlier period The time
chosen was unfortunate, and he believed they could
have been removed at an earlier period without
embarrassment to the public, had the President
acted with less forbearance towards the predeces-
sor of the presentSecretary of the Treasury Mr
Jones here read a passage from the Secretary's
íepoit, showing the reasons which governed h.m
in fixing upon the time of removal     He says.
"It was impossible that the commercial com-
' mumty could have sustained itself much longer
1 under such a policy In the two succeeding
'months the collections of the bank would prob-
< ably have exceeded five millions more, and the
1 State banks would have been obliged to curtail
' in an equal sum The reduction of bank accom-
' modations to the amount of nineteen millions of
' dollars in four months must have almost put an
' end to trade, and before the 1st of October this
' pressure in the principal commercial cities had
' become so intense that it could not have been
' endured much longer without the most serious
'embarrassments. It was then daily mcieasmg,
'and from the best information that I have been
' able to obtain 1 am persuaded that, if the public
' moneys received for revenue had continued to be
' deposited in the Bank of the United States for
' two months longer, and it had adhered to the
' oppressive system of policy whi h it pursued
'during the two preceding months, a widespread
' scene of bankruptcy ai d rum must have fol
1 lowed There was no alternative, therefore, for
'the Tieasury Department, but to act at once,
' or abandon the object altogether^ Duties of the
' highest cnaracter would not pe'rmit the latter
' course, and I did not hesitate promptly to resort
' to the former.
" 1 have stated the condition of the mercantile
'classes at the time of the removal, to explain
' why it was impossible to postpone it even for a
' short period Under other circumstances I should
' have been disposed to direct the removal to take
' effect at a distant day, so as to give Congress an
' opportunity of prescribing, m the mean time, the
' places of deposite, and of regulating the security
' proper to be taken "
In reply to these views the gentleman from
Pennsylvania has furnished us with the reasons
which rendered necessary the curtailments made
by the bank He would inquire how far these
reasons were sufficient for the curtailments. He
had before him a statement of the specie possessed
by the bank for a course of several years, and of
the circulation and discounts of the bank for the
same periods From this it appeared that, in
1824, the bank had six millions in specie, of bills
in circulation eleven millions, and of discounts
thirty-three millions, in 1825, the bank had in
specie six millions, bills eleven millions, and dis-
counts thirty-three millions, in 1826, specie three
millions, hills sixteen millions, and discounts thir-
ty three millions, in 1827, specie six millions, bills
seventeen millions, and discounts thirty-one mil-
lions, in 1828, specie five mill.ons, bills twenty-
two millions, and discounts thirty five millions, in
1829, specie six millions, bills thirteen millions,
discounts thirty nine millions, in 1830, bills fifteen
millions, discounts forty-four millions, in 1831,
bills eighteen millions, discounts forty-four mil-
lions, in 1832, specie six millions, bills twenty-
four millions, discounts sixty seven millions, and
in 1833, specie ten millions, bills eighteen millions,
discounts seventy millions He called the atten-
tion to the continual increase of discounts «hown
by this statement He would also direct the atten-
tion of the House to the fact that six millions in
specie were, in 1832, decried sufficient to sustain
a paper circulation of twenty-four millions, and
that in 1833, with ten millions in specie, and bills
amounting only to eighteen millions, the bank
deems it necessary to curtail her discounts in order
to sustain the credit of her circulation The di-
rectors probably know well what to do in this
matter, but they ought to give us better reasons
for their acts
Mr J now proceeded to consider the reasons
offered by the Secretary of the Treasury for his
act, and he did not entertain a doubt that he could
fully demonstrate the efficiency of those reasons
But here he met the objection that these were not
the reasons of the Secretary of the Treasury, but
of the President, and that the Secretary had no
more to do with them than the iron pen with
which he wrote the order. This, he thought, did
injustice to the Secretary; and it was a matter of
surprise to him that the gentleman from South
Carolina, who was so well acquainted with the
subject, should have assumed such a position in
regard to the act of the Secretary He was no
apologist foi the Secretary, but he was free to
award censure where it was due, and praise where
it was deserved Mr Duane tells us that the
President, when on his eastern trip, transmitted to
him four written opinions on the subject of the
removal of the deposites, which opinions ne had
demanded from his Cabinet
Mr McDUrFIE rose to explain He knew
that the Secretary honestly entertained the opin-
ions on which he acted If the gentleman would
look at his speech he would find what his views
were on this subject His idea was, that when
the President turns out one officer who will not
obey his will, and puts in another who is willing
to obey his will, the President is the author of the
act which he has in view, no matter whether the
officer deems the act legal and expedient or not.
Mr JONES was happy, he continued, that he
had afforded the gen'lemin from South Caioln a
an opportunity to make this explaration    Lest
any one should  misunderstand the  subject, he
I would  read Mr  Duane's published statement of
the opinions expressed by the members of the
Cabinet   The character of Mr Taney placed him
above the suspicion that he would prefer office to
¡ duty    The President had no right to exercise
1 such comiólas to force his Ministers to agree with
1 him, but where they disagreed on vital principles,
