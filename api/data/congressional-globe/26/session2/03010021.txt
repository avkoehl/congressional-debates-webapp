26th Cong....2nd Sess.                                   Pre-emption Law—Mr Benton.                                                                Senate.
gress of dt'cusiton and under circum awes which
proved that it was as disinterested and as feailes^, as
it was enlightened and equitable It took place dur
mg the progress of an adverse measure—the land re-
venue distribution bt'1—a measure calculated to
enlistall the old States against the settlers, against
pre-emptions, and against reduced pnces of the
public lands It was m the face of this amage
mst measure—it was during the progress of this
adverse bill, so hostile to the settlers and the new
States, and so well calculated to a ray all the old
States against the new ones—¡t wasdunng the pro-
gress of this measure which presented so much to
the hopes of a calcula mg politician, and when 'ome
former friends of the new States were faltering and
going way before it— t was m this cnsis that Mr
V>n Buren became sensible of the correctness
of the graduation and pre-emption policy, and from
that time he only waited the appropra e opportu
mty to manifest hi¿ sui'iments Tnat opportunity
presented itself when he became President of the
United States, and in that charaeterhad to dischirge
the constitutional duty ol recommending to Con-
gress the measuies which he deemed proper for their
consideration In htsfirst annual message herecom
mended the graduation and pre eruption policy in
his second message he did the same, 11 the third
he repeated the lecommendation, and in h s fourth
and last, he has adhered to it This his been his
conduct m relation to these imponant measures,
and upon this sta'ement of facts, as concisely as
they weie correctly stated, he (Mr Benton)
rested the assertion, that Mr Van Baren stood at
the head of the list of the meritorious friends oí the
graduation and pre-emption policy, and was enti-
tled to the grati ude and confidence of all who be
lieved, as he did, that that policy was the true
policy of the country, combining m the highes' de-
gree th= interest of ths individual witn the interest
of the public
Having done ¡htsjustice 'oMr Van Buten, and
availed himself of tne advantage of his ¿r uments
in favor of the two bills referred to, he (Mr Ben
ton) would go on to give his. own testimony, de
rived from experience, in their favor It wis row
thirty one years s "ce he had first be n calle ' to
act m al gislaUve capacity on the ubjec' of pre-
emptions, and fourteen year^ since 1 r had rrst
moved the graduation po1 cv on th s floor, and all
expen nee hid confirmed hum in hi' opinion in
favor of the wisdom and jus ice of both measures
As far back as the jeai 1809, he had been a mem
ber of the General Assc ably of the Siate of Ten
nessee—a member of the Senate of thatSlatt—and
in that capacity, had given his cordial support to
the pre en ption po icy, extended by ihat State to
the settlers on the public lands of th  State south of
the HoMon river He had seen the operation of the
pre-emption law then passed by the Legislature of
that State, and h« had seen the operation of all the
pre eruption laws since parsed by Congress He
had seen all— iterally seen it, for his residence m
the West enabled him to see it, and he could truly
say that the opention of the e laws had been equi-
table and beneficia!—good fi r the individual set-
tler—good for the public Treasury—good foi the
country. He was, theicfore, confirmed in the poli
cy by the te t of experience, and should continue
to give it an ardent support He v is for tn^ set-
tler—for tke man that went foiward amidst every
danger, under eveiy privation, and again t e/e y
hardship, to build his log cibm n the depth (1 the
wildernes , and to provide b> bis labor and his
courage for the suppott asd defence of h s fami y
The soil should go to ttie cultivators, was his doc-
trine, the hi st comer having the first chuce, the
second comer die «econd choice, ind so <m to the
end of ths list, speculators and g^aetal parchp-
sers taking ther choice after the fist «ettkrs were
provided tor Thus, experience had le ed the
benefit of the pre emption syst m it had done ihe
same with the gradtahon puncipl-, for this pr nci
pie had been tried m the Sta'e of Tennessee, and
had worked well there it had been tried m the
State of Mississippi, on the Cmckasaw lands, and
by virtue of a clause in their treaty, ratified by the
Senate of the United States, and had worked well
there The graduation principle had worked well
in both these instances', and the public mnd of all
die new S ates, and in a 1 the Ternto íes, was; en
tirelv in favor of i  It was as n cessary m the
ol i counties as the pre emption bill was in the ne
ones, and the cirrent of public opinion was no v
so strong in its favnr, that ihose who rid ctiled it
when he (Mr Bfntton) fi st brought it forward
now eclipsed him in their z al for it, a' d laid hold
of the graduation bi 1 as a passport to popularity,
and as a ladder to promotion
He had pleasure in saving th^t the public mind
throughout the Union had shown it«elf favorable,
during the Ht  Presidential canvss, lo the policy
of these two bills he actual President vas kno vn
to be favoraM=> to thim fr in bis public me sago

so from hi= p¿st vo'es tn this bol and to neither
were his «entimen's on 'h s point objected in an/
part of the Union Mr V?n Buren received near
foar huDdr-d thousand popular votes more than he
lad received m 1836, On°ral Hariron receive!
