over Flint, and also passed about 1,000 of his men on road going to Moulton; part of his men at Whitesburg and Somerville. Martin's division of cavalry was near Blue Moutnain. No force of any amount at Gadsden.

HUNTSVILLE, April 9, 1864.

Brigadier General G. M. DODGE, Athens:

Nothing special from Whitesburg; a few men seen on the other side of the river. Reports place the enemy's force near Whitesburg at about 400 men, and that they have collected some boats above and intend to cross and surprise some of our outposts. If they come over I do not think many of them will get back.

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.

ATHENS, April 9, 1864.

Brigadier General J. D. STEVENSON, Decatur:

The company of Seventh Illinois picketing river from Elk River to Eastport, on this side, reports to-day the appearance of considerable force of rebels at Bainbridge and Florence. General McPherson says they report about 400 rebels opposite Whitesburg, and some above and below that point.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

ATHENS, April 9, 1864.

Major General J. B. McPHERSON, Huntsville:

Most of Clanton's force has gone to Moulton. I have ordered mounted force to push up to Whitesburg if possible. Have you any news from that direction?

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

HUNTSVILLE, April 9, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

General Veatch in his report,* which I send by mail of to-day, incloses copy of order from General Hurlbut which leads me to believe that General Hurlbut is before this advised of his withdrawal from Purdy. I do not see that we can do anything from here to relieve Grierson if he is in any danger, not knowing where he is. The rebel cavalry seem to be making around toward Eastport, possibly with the intention of joining Forrest and trying to get across the Tennessee and interrupt communication in our rear. We will give them a warm reception.

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
