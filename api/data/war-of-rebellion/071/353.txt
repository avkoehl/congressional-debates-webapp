Shall Colonel Warner send this ammunition with escort of twenty men? My inspector-general told me this morning that the sixty-three men and one officer, cavalry, ordered to report to Colonel Hasking at Fort Slocum, are still there. If this ammunition is to go out, some of those men ought to go along.

I am sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Cor. 19th St. and Pa. Ave.:

Colonel Lowell from Poolesville sent yesterday to the quartermaster an urgent dispatch for ammunition. It has reached here. I have but twenty men to escort it. The sergeant-major of Second Massachusetts left Rockville 11 p. m. yesterday; reports Mosby with 200 men between Germantown and Darnestown, going toward the river. When the sergeant reached Muddy Branch he found the block-house in ruins. Sergeant says he saw the force at a distance, and citizens said it was Mosby. Colonel Lowell left Poolesville in the direction of Leesburg about 12 m. Shall I send it with the force I have? Please answer.

J. M. WARNER.
