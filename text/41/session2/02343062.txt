THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 28,
ator from Illinois has said in regard to this
mailer. I agree to the general policy that the
courts of the United States ought not to be
held at a large variety of places, or the dig- 1
triets subdivided. As a general rule that is
probably very correct policy ; but I think that
in this case the Senate might make an excep-
tion, as the Ilouse of Representatives has
already done, the members of the House from
Iowa concurring in the expression of their
desire that it should be done, and that it would
be to the interest of the peoplo of the State
of Iowa to have a term of the district court of
the United States held at Council Bluffs here-
after.
As has been said by the Senator from Illi-
nois, there are now three places of holding the
district court of the United States in Iowa, all
on the eastern side of the State. Our people
want one place on the western side; and as we
have the policy of a division in the State of
Iowa, it is but right and proper that tbe divis-
ion should be made to meet the wants and the
wishes of the people of the State. If hereafter
it be decided to concentrate the district court
of the United States for the State of Iowa at
one point and hold all the courts there, there
would be no ground of complaint on the part
of those in that portion of the State, and they
might be concentrated at the capital; but I beg
of Senators 
Mr. HOWARD. I wish to ask the Senator
from Iowa how many judicial districts there
are in tbe State? More than one?
Mr. HOWELL. I spoke of the district
coart of the United States being held at three
different places in the State.
Mr. HOWARD. Is it the same court ?
Mr. HOWELL. I understand it to be the
same court and the same judge.
Mr. HOWARD. Then there is bat one
district ?
Mr. TRUMBULL. The State is divided by
, boundaries into districts, certain counties em- 1
bracing each district; bnt the same judge holds
the courts.
Mr. HOWARD. How many districts are
there ?
Mr. TRUMBULL. Three.
Mr. HOWELL. They are snb-districts.
Mr. POMEROY. It is evident that this
matter cannot be settled to-night, and there-
fore I object to the further consideration of the
bill.
Mr. HOWELL. One word farther, if the
Senator from Kansas pleases.
Mr. POMEROY. The Senator can hardly
hope by unanimous consent to reverse the re- :
port of the committee. However, I am willing
to hear the Senator's remarks. i
Mr. HOWELL. AH I have to say farther
is that at present the railroad system of Iowa
is not sufficiently perfected to admit of parties
and witnesses and jurors traveling with facility
and convenience and at moderate expense from ;
the different points of the State to other points; |
bat that portion of the State to be included in !
-these boundaries will be easily accessible and j
convenient to Council Bluffs. I think that in i i
view of the fact that the bill has passed the '< \
House of Representatives with the unanimous ,
concurrence of the members ot' the House from
Iowa, the Senate here need not press a partic- ;
ular policy to such a degree as to rale this bill !
oat and reject it, now that it has passed the |
other Honse. I
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator
from Kansas desires that the bill be passed 1
over; and the next bill will be reported.
PROCEEDINGS IN FEDERAL COURTS. |
Tbe next bill on the Calendar vas the bill I;
(S. No. 151) to further the administration of j
justice.
Mr. POMEROY. Let that be passed over.
The Senator from Wisconsin who reported it
[Mr. Carpenter] is not here to-day, and I
understand he desires to address the Senate
upon it
Mr. STEWART afterward said! I should
like to iuquire if Senate bill No. 151, to further
the administration of justice, was objected to?
The VICE PRESIDENT. It was passed
over, it being stated that the Senator from
Wisconsin [Mr. Carpenter] desired to speak
upon it when it came up.
Mr. STEWART. This is a bill that I do not
think he cares to speak about. It was the bill
to increase the judge's salaries he wanted to
speak about.
Mr. POMEROY. If the Senator knows that
1 have no objection.
Mr. STEWART. He spoke to me in regard
to the bill increasing salaries.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will be
stated again, subject to objection.
The Secbetauy. It is a bill (S. No. 151) to
further the administration of justice.
The Committee on the Judiciary reported
an amendment, to strike out all after the en-
acting clause of the bill, and in lieu thereof to
insert the following:
That from and after tho 1st day of July, in tho
year of our Lord 1870, tho several district judges of

incases pending in the circuit court of their respect-

Mr. BOREMAN. I prefer that that bill
i should be passed over.
| The VICE PRESIDENT. It will be passed
! over.
JOSEPH LANMAN.
The next bill on the Calendar was the bill
(S. No. 726) for the relief of Joseph Lanman.
It provides for paying to Joseph Lanman, rear
admiral in the United States Navy, the differ-
! ence between the pay of a commodore and that
of a rear admiral of the United States Navy,
i from December 7,1867, to April 14,1868.
Mr. BUCKINGHAM. Let the report be
| read in that case.
; The Secretary read the report submitted by
â–  Mr. Stockton*, from the Committee on Naval
| Affairs, on the 30th of March, as follows:
i The Committee on Naval Affairs, to whom was
, referred the petition of Rear Admiral Joseph Lan-
: man, praying the difference of pay between commo-
| dore and rear admiral from December 7, 1867, to
1 April 14,1863, have considered the same, and report
| as follows:
; That on the 18th of December, 1867, the nomina-
1 tion of the petitioner to be rearadmiral was madeout
; at the Navy Department, to fill the vacancy caused
i by the death of Rear Admiral James S. Palmer,
1 December 7,1867.
I That on the same day the nomination so mads out
I was taken by the Secretary of the Navy in person
j to the President for his signature; that through tho
mistake or inadvertence of tho President's secre-
tary the nomination was mislaid, and did not reach
the Senate till April, 1868.
That his commission gives the petitioner rank as
rear admiral from December 8,18o8, but that he has
been allowed the pay due to that rank only from
April 14.1868, the date of his commission, having
been allowed only the pay of commodore from
December 8,1867, to April 14,1868.
The foregoing statement of facts shows that the
petitioner lailed to secure his commission as rear
admiral, at or about the timo, of his nomination,
Only through the mistake or inadvertence of an-
