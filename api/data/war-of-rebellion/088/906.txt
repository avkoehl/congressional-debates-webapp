HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,September 18, 1864

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

There have been no changes of troops on my line. I have not been advised of the cause of the artillery firing. I would respectfully suggest that the captains and lieutenants who have independent authority to open fire from the heavy guns on my line should, when they do so, advise my division general commanding their line why they do so, so that I can learn the cause. When I took command of this line there was a constant, incessant musket and artillery fire, General Ord losing 1,000 men during a month. I have tried to reduce the matter to a system, and have opened on the town only to stop the fire on my troops. I think it will be found that less ammunition has been expended during my command than during same time preceding, and troops have had more rest and done double the fatigue duty.

Major-General.
