Brigadier General THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Commanding Saint Louis District, Saint Louis, Mo.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to represent that the earth-works or forts at this post need repairing, and some additional works to render them defensible. They were rudely and hastily constructed, and with little additional labor and expense could be made tolerably strong. I would respectfully suggest that an officer of engineers be sent down to examine them and report on such improvements as may be necessary.
