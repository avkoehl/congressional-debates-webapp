THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June &,
notice of the Senate, goes cleaily to show that
the position that an officer, while m public ser-
vice is not entitled to an invalid pension, is
who'll) untenable. The act for the relief ot
Tiionns \pC Jone^,giants him aneáis ot pen-
sion to which he was entitled on account of a
pernnnent disability, occasioned by a wound
received by him m battle with the enemy during
the hst war with Gieat Britain, commencing at the
tune he leaned the wound This act was passed
in May, 1634 Captain Jones had long been, and
was then, in the sei vice of the United States, and
he still is in the service of the United States, and
in the receipt of full pay for that service. This
case, then, establishes,and rightfully establishes,
the principle, that the invalid pension should com-
mence with the commencement of the disability,
and should be commensuiate with the degree of
disability Upon principle, then, as well as in
accordance with existing precedents,should Gen-
eral Ripley's pension, as an invalid, go back to
the time when he was wounded
I ha\e before stated that General Ripley left the
Army in 1820, and I have also stated the cause
which pievented his being placed upon the pen-
sion list. But the time had come when he was to
be relieved fiom the cares, and no longer to be en-
titled to the piofits of office But with that ev ent
comes " i/ie unkindest cut of all." He stands
recorded, and is held out to the world as a de-
faulter—as a debtor to the Government. A laige
balance was struck against him at the Treasury
office, and from this consideration he was pre-
vented ftom then being placed on the list of in-
valids, and drawing his pension. On referring
to the appropriation bills from 1821 to 1836, it
will be found that, in the acts of Congress making
appropriations for the military seivice, which in-
cludes appropriations for every class of pension-
ers, Jl is in effect pi ovulcd that no money shall be paid
to any person who is \n an ears to the United States,
until such per«on shall lutve accounted for, and paid
into, the Treasury., all sums for which he may be liable.
Such was the law, and such was the practice, at
the different Departments. And in January, 1828,
Congress passed a general act to prevent defalca-
tions on the part of the disbursing agents of the
Government, and that act contained tne piecise
provisions which had been for many years in-
corporated into the public appropriation bills.
No disbursing military officer ought to bp dis-
charged from the public service until his accounts
were fully settled This is a sound and safe prin-
ciple; but in a total disregard of this principle,
the resignation of General Ripley was accepted,
and no sooner was it done, when one account was
stated at the Tieasury Department, whereby it
appeared " that the sum of $13,163 10, asdue by
Eleazer W. Ripley, late Major General in the
Army of the United States, was found against
him on settlement of his accounts;" and in less
than one month thereafter, another account was
stated at the Treasury Department, whereby it
appeared that a further sum of $4,154 95 was
found against him, making in all the sum of
$17,318 05 as the balance due from General Rip-
ey to the United States. These balances, thus
struck, one in Apul, the other in May, 1821, at
the Treasury Department, presented an insur-
mountable obstacle to his obtaining his long-
neglected but justly-merited claim for an invalid
pension. There cannot be well conceived an act
of more flagrant injustice, of grosser wrong, than
to strike these balances against General Ripley,
after he had voluntarily resigned his commission,
and then bring up those very balances in judg-
ment against him whenever he pressed his claim
for a pension. It is highly creditable to the Com-
mittee on Pensions of the Senate, that they have
done away this practice, by bringing forward at
this very session a bill, and which ha  now be-
come the law of the land:
" That the act entitled an cAn act to prevent defalcations
on the part of thedisbursingagents of the Government, and
for other purposes,' approved the 2Sth of January, 18-28,
shall not be construed to authorize the pension of any pen-
sioner of the United States to be withheld "                     I
It is not my purpose, standing here as a friend
of General Ripley, to allude to the embarrass-
ments and difficulties which attended every move-
ment he made with a view to the adjustment of
these account  at the Treasury Department.   I
f.
may, however, be permitted to say that no man
feels more deeply the positive wrongs which have
been inflicted upon him—the grosi neglecti which
have been practiced toward him by the Govern-
ment of his countiy, than General Ripley. It
cannot be otlviwiae In November, 1814, Con-
gress passed a highly complimentary resolution
in favoi of this distinguished officer, but, until
it was brought to the notice of the Senate by
the chairman of the Committee on Finance, at
this very session, that resolution has been per-
mitted to remain unnoticed and unobserved in the
archives of the Government. But, whatever may
have been the feelings of General Ripley, they
were the secret workings of his own heart. The
language of complaint against the justice of his
country, for which he so long served, and so feely
bled, has never escaped his lips.
But in relation to those pretended Treasury
balances, the United States, in September, 1822,
commenced two suits against General Ripley in
the district court of Louisiana, to enforce their
collection. After the suits were consolidated, they
were continued from term to term, until May,
1830, when the trial took place. The verdict of
the jury was returned for the defendant They
allowed to General Ripley, for his account and
for his extra service...............015,060 22
They deducted therefiom the balance
due the United States.............11,929 32
Leaving due to General Ripley......    $3,130 90
"Whereupon the court ordered that the United
States take nothing by these petitions. To the
proceedings on tual in this case, and to the ruling
of the judge, a bill of exceptions was filed by the
attorney of the Government, and allowed by the
court, and the defendant, m like manner, filed a
bill of exceptions to a certain ruling of the court,
which went to the exclusion from the considera-
tion of the jury of so much of General Ripley's
cKim, in. offset, as he made for anearages of pen-
sion since 1814 Thtrewas one extraordinary
fact, to which I íefer as worthy of particulei no-
tice, and which occurred during the trial, and is
now mattei of íecord. So entirely conscious were
the jury thvt General Ripley ought to have been
allowed his pension from th"1 commencement of
his disability, that '• the foreman of thejury, after
handing the veidiet to the couit, stated, that ¡t
was the unanimous wish of ihe jury to allow the
claim for ant mages of pension, and requested
infoimation whethei it would be legal to allow
it " The com t charged them that they could not,
and their verdict was made up accordingly
Bat with the termination of this tual did not
terminate the suffering of General Ripley, grow-
ing out of this prosecution, if it may not w°ll be
called persecution, of his Government. A wnt of
error was sued out, and the case biought befoie
the Supreme Court of the United States . Gen
eral Ripley could notand did not follow this case
to Washington, he had nothing to fear from that
quarter, not hid he any appiehension that any
jury of his country could ever be empaneled by
any court of trial to pa"s bctvv een him and his
Government,which vv onld return averdict against
him. He had entire confidence in the justice of
his case, and he r posed with perfect security m
thatjustice. The cause came br-foie the Supreme
Court, and aftei having been argued by Mr.
Taney, the late Attorney Geneial foi the United
States, (no counsel appearing foi the defendant,)
was finally disposed of at the January term, 1833
In the trial below, General Ripley made claim—
first, for certain extra disbuisements made by
him, and second, for certain extra services pei-
formed by him.    The Supreme Court decided,
"That if the disbursements mad'' for wmch compensa
tion is claimed were not sucii as were ordinarily attached
to the duties ot the office held by the defendant, the fact
should hate been so stated, and also that the service was
perlormed under the sanction ot the Government, or under
such circumstances as rendered the extra labor and re
sponsibihty assumed bj the defendant, in performing it,
necpssary    Should the accounting officer of the Treasury
Department refuse to allow an officer the established com
pensation which belongs to Ins station, the claim, having
been rejected, should unquesuonably be allowed by wayot
set off to a demand of the Government, by a court or jury
" And it is equally clear that an equitable allowance
should be made in the same manner for extra services per-
formed by an officer, which did not come within the Une
of his official duty, and which had been performed under
the sancuon of the Government, or under circumstances of
peculiar emergency In such a case the compensation
«hould be graduated bj the amount pud (or like scrvtees
under similir cireum-tinees 1T« me nnv satelv be relied
on in such cises, as fixing .i ui-t competition
" The allowance-, cliuned under the second lirad lor m r
viecs which did not come vvittiin the nn o of his ofhual
duties, should have bei n pertorned vv nil tin snutioiof
the Government, or undti cncuin tinee-, above stated "
The court, in conclusion, ícmarked that the dis,-
tinguished services rendu id by the deftndant
during the late war are advantageously known
to the country; but the claims set up in the case
under consideration must be brought within the
established rules on the subject, before they can
receive judicial sanction, and as, in the opinion of
this court, the district court erred, as their in-
structions to thejury were given without qualifi-
cation, the judgment must be i everted, and the cause
  emanded, for proceeding de novo This interesting
case is reported in detail, in seventh volume of
Peters' Reports.
The abstract made of the proceedings and
decisiohs of the Supreme Court satisfactorily
establishes the positions taken by the defendant
on the trial, and the only en or committed by the
judge below was, in giving unqualified mstiuc-
hons to thejury upon the points assumed. That
the defendant was entitled to recover for disburse-
I ments made by him, not such as were ordinarily
attached to the duties of his office, as well as for
extraordinary services, admitted of no doubt, and
notwithstanding the clear exposition of the prin-
ciples, made by the Supreme Court, which weie
to govern the district court in the trial of this
cause, and notwithstanding those principles were
most favorable to the lights of General Ripley,
yet this same cause was a second time pressed on
foi trial by the United States, and the defendant
was driven to the necessity of again preparing for
trial, and of submitting to all the costs and charges
which weie thereby imposed upon him All this
was done. In 1833 the cause was remanded for
a new trial in the district court of Louisiana; and
in two years after, in May, 1835—making thir-
teen yeais since the commencement of this pios-
ecution—the cause was tried anew by another
jury of his coun "-y, and upon the punciples laid
down by the Supremo Couit for the government
of the case. Mai k igain the result—it is detailed
in an official letter ftom the Solicitor of the Treas-
ury to the Second Auditor, which I will read:

Thus, at a second trial, under all the delays
and disadvantages I have detailed, the verdict of
his peers is that, instead of General Ripley being
a debtor to the Government, he is its creditor
upon the claims exhibited to them, and beyond
all the claims of the Government, in the sum of
$20,596 12.
Such, Mr. President, is the origin, the prog-
ress, and the termination of these two suits
commenced against General Ripley, with how
much credit or honor to ihe country I, foi one, leave
others to say; but I will not hesitate to declare
that they originated in error, and have been car-
ried forward in error; that the Government, in
