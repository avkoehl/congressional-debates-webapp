Colonel WILLIAM GAMBLE,

Eighth Illinois Cavalry, Commanding Camp Stoneman:

COLONEL: The major-general commanding directs that the 157 men alluded to in your dispatch of this p.m. be prepared to march with as little delay as practicable. They will be placed on picket duty on the Potomac, with headquarters at Muddy Branch. Major Ludlam, Eighth Illinois Cavalry, will report to you at 8 p.m., to assume command of the detachment and move it. The chief of the Cavalry Bureau has informed these headquarters that the First Delaware Cavalry has arrived at Camp Stoneman. Be pleased to report the hour of its arrival. Such officers as you have send with the detachment under orders. It is desirable that these men, as far as possible, belong to the same regiments. Furnish a list of officers assigned to duty with them, and give the number of officers left in your camp available for duty with the detachments to be sent when mounted.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Afterward arm, equip, and mount the First New Hampshire Cavalry. Report progress in each case, and inform these headquarters how many officers you need to send with the troops now in your camp waiting commandants, making the estimate as low as possible without detriment to the service.
