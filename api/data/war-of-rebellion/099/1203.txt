ADJUTANT AND INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Richmond, Va., February 16, 1865.

Colonel E. E. PORTLOCK,

Assistant Inspector-General:

COLONEL: Representations have been made from so many quarters prejudicial to the character of Wheeler's cavalry as to make it desirable that an examination should bemade respecting their foundation, as, if ture, they are calculated (as they have been said to have done) to produce dissaffection amongst the people and to bring reproach upon our arms. Whilst so constantly engaged in front of the enemy, it is impossible to make a regular inspection, but by visiting their camps and observing their management and the degree of discipline exercised, and in passing over the country through which they have operated you can learn enough to be able to report advisedly. With large bodies of troops, especially cavalry, there must occur some irregularities, growing out of straggling, but where the latter prevails to an extent which impairs the efficiency of a command, and depredations or ourtrages are committed indiscriminately, it is sufficient grounds upon which to suspect inefficiency. See what system is pursued to prevent straggling; what punishments, if any, have been inflicted for irregularities, and what means are adopted to supply men and animals of his command. See and examine the inspectors upon this subject, report facts coming under your observation, or where complaints are made let them be substantiated by the proper affidavits or certificates. Abuses which can be corrected by the commanding general report to him for correction, advicing this office of that fact. In fact, colonel, your mission is to report abuses wherever found, and to correct them in so far as can be done through department commanders, with whom you will communicate upon all points over which their authority extends. As nothing of an official character has been reported respecting the cavalry referred to you, will consider the rumors herein reported as merely designed to direct your attention to alleged abuses, and, found incorrect, to disabuse
