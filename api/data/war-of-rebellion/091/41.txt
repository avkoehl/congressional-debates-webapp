Commanding Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: Your note * of last night received. The Ninth New York Cavalry reported they opened communication with you yesterday afternoon. Your falling back to Bunker Hill is all right; I cannot think, however, that there was a rebel division of infantry in your front. I have directed the railroad to be repaired from Harper's Ferry to Martinsburg. General Merritt is nearest to you and will instructed to communicate.

Respectfully,
