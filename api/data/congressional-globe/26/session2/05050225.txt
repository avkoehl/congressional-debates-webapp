san, and Iowa, were rapidly peopled The
flourishing and populous towns of Galena, Da-
traque, and many, others, sprang into exis-
tence hke magic, and m a iew years the
•wilderness was made to blossom like a garden
Look, for one moment, at the results. This people
dug from the bowels of the earth hidden nehes,
and from that time ha/e increased the production
of lead until it amoaab ain tally to twenty or
thirty millions of pounds being, perhaps, suffi- i
cient to render us independen! ot •breign nations

fence m time of v ar Ma.sachusetts, and o ner
manufacturing Stales upon the Atlantic bo der,
where labor is cheap, are as much, or more inte-
rested, perhaps, than we are, m bus producing na-
tional wealth, as they supply manufactured articles
in return for the raw material. His. own constitu-
ents had also contributed to the san oí national
wealth by ihe production of several millions of
pounds of lead annually; math of it was made
from public lands, or from priva e property ac-
quired under previous pre-emption laws They
Were now turning their attention, wth energy, to
the cultivation of hemp, aad such was the value
of the article for its fineness, silkmess, and strength,
that it commanded, m the Bos'on market, twenty
dollars per ton more than that raised in Kentucky,
and was now even imponed into that S'ate for the
purpose of being wroi ¡ ht mto bagging He un-
derstood, from undoubted authority, that it is
stronger than the best Russian h mp This
hemp was raised upon lands the tu e to most
of which w¿s acquired under the opera'ion
of the pre-emption law, or by squatteis, who
are now awaiting the passage oí one. This
was important for th* support oí an important arm

Daniel Boon co ixnenced the *e "ement oi Ken-
tucky? There were no such laws then as ovr pre-
emption laws, taking from ¡he settler a do'lar and
a quarter per acre for his lands—no law to res'ra n
him from the wilderness He roam°d and squatted
where he pleased, and no one knew better than his
friend [Mr. Crittenden] what had been the re-
sults. A paradise had been opsned, but airiest
every-acre of its soil had b'en fattened by the best
blood of the land. Driven from Kentucky by in-
justice, and impelled by his love of darger, Boon
sought a lonely spot in. Missouri, on the extreme

«peeies. He would rejoice to see it surmount the
rugged tops of the Rocky mountains, and, pouring
over into the fertile valleys beyond, form, by its
presence and i's valor, an impenetrable barrier
against Great Britain on the north, and any other
power to ihe south. Let the free race of A-nerican
pioneers go onward Wes', carrying their love of
lioerty, and all their free and beneficent institutions
with them, and he would epeourge their progress,
by every means withm the compass of his ability,
even to the utmost verge of the continent.
When the bill in regard to the Oregon Territory
should come op, Mr Likn hoped the Senator from
Kentucky [Mr Chittenden] might tyke the «awe
view ot the ¡subject wh ch he did, and that ne
should Aen enjoy all the benefit of his powetful
aid It was toe State fretn which that S nator
came, and bis own native State, that first «tiled its
putsuc lands undei the Sj stem of free occupation.
Titey came first into the gtMt wilderness of the
West, their fathers had had the brunt to bear, and
he hoped one day to see a noble monument erected,
i( not to these bold and enterprising men, at least to
the noble-souled women who had accompanied
their fathers and husbands into the wilderness,
often fought by their sides, and shared la th<-ir toils
and dangers. Cheated they had been, and wiong-
cd m every practicable shape, by the petty county
court lawyer^ and other reptiles, who were ever
found haunting the preemcts of a court; and now,
to this nour, they were pursued by the same class
of wretches—heartless speculators—who were
every where prowling along our frcntier, but who
were not now permitted by public opinion to wiorg
tnem
These advancing pioneers were made of the ster-
ling stuff, whiCT presented a tremendous battery
lor the pro'ec ion of the «econdiry, but more tim d
end eiiemmate, c'ass wh ch fo'lo ed m tneir foot-
steps. Tttcy hewed down the timber, they sub-
dued and exteimtnated the beas's of prey, they dts
covered and developed the natural resources of the
csuntry, they compelled th  ioving Indian to re-
eds, and SieK more distant hunting grounds, they
added to the naUonal weal h And would gentlemen
forego advantages like 'hese, for the sake of ob-
taining some five or six cents more per acre far the

hi Se~n*e, Tutsiaii, Fell war j U, 1841—The bi'l to
aatho i?e tne issue ot frtasury rotes havi"g
leen, taken ap a> mcommittee ot the while, and
t e outs ion D""ng oi ord nn^ it to a third
res iusr,
Mr BEN TOW asked fot the yeas and nay-,
1
that he might have an opportunity of reeordiag htá
name in opposition to th s annual Treasury Note
bill, whicn now seemed to come tn as a mere mat •
ter of course when the Trea^uiy needed money.
He was willing to vote for a loan, or for duties on
proper objects, if money was necessary—if more
was nectary than th* current ineome would sup-
ply—but he was averse to Treasury i'sues of pa-
per, and wished to appear to upon the record. He,
therefore, asked lor the yeas and nays.
Tney were ordered.
Mr. B. ¿aid iw had once voted for a Treasury
note bill—voted fur it with extreme reluctanee__
win an alm¡ st mexpress ble repugnance—and had
no ssoner done it than he regretted it. This «as
at the extra session of 1837, when the Govurnment
was suddenly stripped of its revendes by the gene-
ral suspension of the bank^, and when, in the
opinion of the Seere'ary cf the Treasure it
would have feeen impc s.,'ble to negotiate a
loan in time to prevent the catastrophe
of a stoppage of paymen s by the Govern-
ment. Under such circumstances, he had
yielded to the iren hand of imperious ne-
ces ity, and voted for a Tieasury note bill,
which he then hoped wa? to be the last
which he should ever see. Even then he did not
yield until every feature of a currency had been
eradicated from the character of the netes—um.l
they were p!?ced upon the foottLg of real promisso-
ry note«, to be payable to order, and not to bearer—
to be transferable by endorsement—to bear a fair
mt rest—to be payable at a fixed time—snd when
paid, not to be reissued, but tasen up and cancel-
led like any other paid off and extinguished bond.
It was not until the notes were made to wear this
form and were raised n their minimum denomi-
nation from twenty io one hundied dollars, that he
would eonsent to vote ¡or the bill. Even then he
couid not do it without a protest and remonstrance
agaim it He sp"kc again&t it—delivered his sen-
timents decidedly, if not strongly, in opposition to
the pehcy of the measure, and, with the leave of
t je S naie, would now read a read passage from
t íe speect which ho then ^e ivered
