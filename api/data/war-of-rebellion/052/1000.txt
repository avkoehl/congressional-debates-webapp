NEAR ALPINE, September 12, 1863-4 p.m.

General D. S. STANLEY:

General McCook directs me to state to you that a train of wagons belonging to the cavalry command is now standing in the road up the mountain, entirely blockading it and making it impossible to move wagons up or down. A supply train belonging to the Third Division, Twentieth Army Corps, has been at the summit of the mountain waiting to get down since noon to-day, but could not get by the above train. General Sheridan's men are entirely out of rations to-night, and General McCook requests that you will take immediate measures to have the staled or overloaded wagons removed, so that these supply wagons can get down.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

NEAR ALPINE, September 12, 1863-7 p.m.

Colonel DODGE:

General McCook directs that if you have not already opened that road up the mountains you clear it no further, but leave it blockaded.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
