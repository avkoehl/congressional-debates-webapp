SUPERINTENDENT RICHMOND AND PETERSBURG RAILROAD,

Richmond:

Can trains run through to Petersburg? If so, send all cars available to Rice's Turnout. If they cannot run through, can any be sent from Petersburg to the point where the road is broken. It is important to get troops to Petersburg without delay.
