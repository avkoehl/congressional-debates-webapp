GENERAL: I shall commence making demonstrations against Richmond on the New Market road to-morrow morning (the 15th), and will continue to do so as long as I remain here, refitting and getting my command in condition.

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,Baltimore Store, May 19, 1864.

I left Haxall's on the 17th in the evening, and arrived here last night, 18th. I communicated to you, via Washington, outlines of our operations until we arrived at Haxall's. I find it impossible to cross the Pamunkey, in fact, all the streams are much swollen and it will take a day or two for them to run down. I will remain here until I can find out the position of your army. I find it exceedingly difficult to shape my movements on account of not knowing where you are. I will commence demonstrating on the railroads, and destroyed them if possible. I have sent for supplies, to be shipped to the White House; also for pontoons to cross the Pamunkey.

The enemy have infantry at Mechanicsville, and are watching me closely. They were making arrangements with their infantry to catch me at Haxall's. After the repulse of our troops of Drewry's Bluff they sent troops to Bottom's Bridge to head me off. In the cavalry engagement at Yellow Tavern, Major-General Stuart was killed, and at Meadow Bridge next day, General Gordon, commanding brigade in Hampton's division, was severely wounded. The enemy's cavalry was very badly whipped.

Very respectfully,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
