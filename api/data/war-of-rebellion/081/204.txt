Brigadier-General MARTINDALE:

Major-General Butler has sent for General Hinks' command. Is this command necessary for your purposes, or can you spare it? I am authorized by Lieutenant-General Grant to retain such portions of the Eighteenth Corps as I deem necessary, but if you can spare General Hinks I have no objection to his going. You know the situation in your front better than I do.

General Martindale had gained the crest occupied by the enemy, without much opposition. This crest is parallel with Harrison's Creek, and may be designated by Page's house on the right. His line is going to advance so soon as the troops on his left make up to his position. Some 40 prisoners taken.
