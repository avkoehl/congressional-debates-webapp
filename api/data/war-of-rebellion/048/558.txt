CIRCULAR.*] HEADQUARTERS THIRD ARMY CORPS, November 13, 1863.

The major-general commanding the Third Army Corps, in promulgating the complimentary order of the general commanding the army, deems it a proper opportunity to express his admiration of the high soldier-like qualities of the officers and men of the corps, exemplified in the forcing of the passage of the Rappahannock at Kelly's Ford on the 7th instant.

To the fact that the river was in the front of the enemy, and not in their rear, they are indebted for their escape after the storming of their rear, they are indebted for their escape after the storming of their intrenchments, saving, by a precipitate retreat over the open country behind them, their flags and cannon.

By command of Major-General French:

O. H. HART,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Numbers 2. Return of Casualties in the Union forces engaged at Rappahannock Station, Va., November 7, 1863.
