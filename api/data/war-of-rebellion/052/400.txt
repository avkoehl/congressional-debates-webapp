Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

We have captured another train at Morristown, and hope to get a good portion of the rolling stock higher up on the road. Command in good spirits. We are making some movements to aid Rosecrans. A bearer of dispatches leaves here this evening or to-morrow with particular.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Louisville, September 6, 1863.

Brigadier-General POTTER:

I dislike to spare any part of the Seventy-first Indiana, as there is so much apprehension of raid from Pound Gap, but I am anxious that you have a mounted force, and if you cannot do without, you must take one battalion of the Seventy-first Indiana. You can send telegraphic orders for it if it is not at Lexington.

Brigadier-General.

LOUISVILLE KY.,

September 6, 1863.

General POTTER:

There are from 300 to 400 men of different commands at Glasgow belonging to the Twenty-third Army Corps. If you go by Somerset and Albany, I can have them at Albany by some appointed time. They have been delayed by reports that Hamilton has 500 or 600 rebels and some artillery on the Cumberland River. If you send a messenger to General Burnside I wish to send a package.
