DESCRIPTION  OP A BALL   ON   BOARD
THE FRIGATE UNITED STATES :   By
N   P   Willis
Trieste —The guns were run out of the potts,
the main and mizen masts were wound with red
and white bunting, the capstan was railed with
arms and wieathed with flowers, the «heel was
tied with nosegays, the American eagle stiod
against the mainmast, with a star of midshipmen's
swords glittering above it, festoons of eveigreens
weie lanej through the ngg ng, the companion-
way was arched with hoops oi green leaves and
roses, the de"ks were tastefully chalked, thecom-
modore'b. skylight was piled with cushions, and
covered with red damask, for an ottoman, seats
were laid along from one carronade to the other,
and the whole was enclosed with a temporary tent,
lined throughout with showy flags, aid studded
all over with boqaets of all tne floweis of Illyna
Chandeliers made of bayonets, battle-lanterns, and
candles n any quantity, were disposed all over the
hall A spleidid supper was set out on the gun-
deck below, draped in with flags. Our own and
the Constellation's boats were to be at the pier at
nine o'clock, to bring off the ladies, and at noon
everything promised of the brightest
First, about four in the afternoon, came up a
saucy looking cloud fiom the westernmost peak
of the Friuli Then followed, fiom every point
towards the north, an extended edge of a broad,
solid, black sheet, which rose with the regularity
of a curtain, and began to send down a wind upon
us, which made us look anxiously to our ball room
bowlines The midshipmen were all foiward,
watching it from the forecastle The lieutenants
weie in the gangway, watching it from the ladder
The commodore looked seriously out of the lar
board cabin port It was as grave a ship's com-
pany as ever looked out for a shipwreck.
The country about Trieste is shaped like a bel-
lows, and the city and harbor he in the nose
They have a wind that comes down through the
valley called the " bora," which sevei&l times in
the year is strong enough to lift people from their
feet We could see by the clouds of dust on the
mountain roads that it was coming. At six o'clock
the shrouds began to cieak, the white tops flew
from the waves in showers of spray, and the roof
of our sea-palace began to shiver in the wind
There was no more hope We had waited even
too long All hands were called to take down
chandeliers, swoid stars, and ottomans, and be-
fore it was half done the storm was upon us, the
bunting was flying and flapping, the nicely chalked
decks were washed with ram, and strewn with
leaves of flowers, and the whole structure, the
tas'eand labor of the ship's company for two days,
was a watery wreck
L eutenant C------, who had the direction of the
whole, was the officer of the deck He sent for
his peajacket, and leaving him to pace out his
wa'ch among the ruins of his imagination, we
went below to get early to bed and forget oui dis-
appointment in sleep.
The next morning the sun rose without a veil
The "blue Friuh" looked clear and fresh, the
southwest wind came over softly from the shore
of Italy, and we commenced retrieving our disaster
with elastic spirit Nothing had suffered seriously
except the flowers, and boats were despatched
ashore for fiesh supohes, while the awnings weie
lif'ed higher and wider than before, the bright-
colored flags replaced, the arms polished and ar-
ranged in an improved order, and the decks re-
chalked with new devices At six in the evenm 
everything was swept up, and the ball room aston°
lshed even ourselves It was the prettiest place
for a dance in the world
Tne ship has an admirable band of twenty Ital-
ians, collected from Naples and other ports, and a
fanciful orchestra was raised for them on the lar
board side of the mainmast. They struck up a
march as the fust boat full of ladies stepped on the
deck, and in the course of half an hour the waltz-
w* commenced with at least two hundred couples,
vh le the ottoman and the seats undet the hnm-
me'cloths were filled with spec'a'ors Thetiigate
has a lofty poop, and there was room enough on
it for two quadrilles after it had served as a recep-
tion loom. It was edged with a temporary bal-
ustrade, wreathed with flowers and studded with
lights,, and the cabin bet eath (on a le^el with the
mam ball room) was set out with card tables
r.om the gangway entrance the scene was like a
oiithant theatrical ballet
An amusing part of it was the sailors' imitation
on the forward decks They had taken the waste
shiubbery and evergreens, of which theie was a
great quantity, and had formed a sort of giove, ex-
tending all around It was arched with festoons of
leaves, with quantities of fruit tied among them,
and over the entrance was suspended a lough pic-
ture of a frigate with the inscription, " rue liade
andvnlots'iigliib " The forecastle was ornamented
with cutlasses, and one or two nautical tiant,-
parencies, with pistols and mimatuie -ships m'er-
spersed, and the whole lit up handsomely The
men,diessed in then white duck trousers and blue
jackets, sat round on the guns playing at draughts,
or listening to the music, or gazing at the ladies
constantly promenading fore and aft, and to me
this was one of the moat interesting parts of the
spectacle. Fivehundied weatherbeaten and manly
faces are a fine sight anywhere.
The dance went gaily on The reigning belle
was an American, but we had lovely women of all
nations among our guests Theie are several
wealthy Jewish families in Trieste, and then dark-
eyed daughteis, we may say at this distance, are
full of the thoughtful loveliness peculiar to the
race Then we had Iilynans and Germans, and
—Terpsichore be our witness—how they danced'
My travelling companion, the Count of Friuh
was there, and his little Viennese wife, though she
spoke no Christian language, danced as featly as a
fan y Of strangers passing through Tueste we
had several of distinction. Among them was a
fascinating Milanese Marchioness, a relative of
Manzoi i's, the novelist, (and as enthusiastic and
eloquent a lover of her country as I ever listened to
on the subject of oppressed Italy,) and two hand-
some young men, the Counts Niepperg, sons-in-
law to Maria Louisa, wno amused themselves as
if they had seen nothing better in the little Duchy
of Parma
We went below at midnight to supper, and the
ladies came up with renewed spirit to the dance
It was a brilliant scene indeed. The officers of
both ships, in full uniform, the gentlemen from
shore, mostly military, m fulWress, the gayety of
the bright red bunting, laced w.th white and blue,
and studded, wherever they would stand, with
floweis,and the really uncommon number of beau-
tiful women, with the foreign features and com-
plexions, so rich and captivating to our eyes,
produced altogether an effect unsurpassed by any-
thing I have ever seen even at the Court fetes of Eu-
rope The daylight gun fired at the close of a gal-
lopade, and the crowded boats pulled ashoie with
their lovely freight by the broad light of morning.
Mr. Editor: The following mournful
intelligence, I have just received from a
gentleman from the neighborhood where
the scene occurred A Mr Shrader, of
Henry county, who has long been ad-
dicted to habits of intoxication, on the
night of the 9th instant, after a fit of de-
bauch, killed thiee of his children, and
abused his wife in such a way that her
life i-, despaned of. What will the oppo-
nents of temperance societies in Kentucky
and elsewhere say to this? A like catas-
tiophe occurred in the same neighborhood
about five or six years ago. In this case
the man shot his wife dead, and immedi-
ately afterwards dispatched himself in the
same way —F/anLfort Argus.
Yankee Speculation —It will be recol-
lected that the ship Tuscany sailed from
Boiton last spung uith a cargo of ice for
Calcutta. Accounts hive been received
of her safe arrival out, and that very little
of her ice had melted. The Hindoos will
soon use it up, however, and, it is to be
hoped, to a good advantage to the shipper.
