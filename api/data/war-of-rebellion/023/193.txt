The guards will be visited twice a week at irregular intervals by special inspectors detailed by the general commanding the lines; once to instruct them in their duties, see that they are performing them properly, and correct all irregularities committed by them either in regard to their military duties or toward the inhabitants of the country; the other week's visit will be made by passing along on the cars to see whether the guards are attentive and vigilant. The commanders of every guard which is found to be negligent will be arrested and taken to headquarters of the general commanding the lines for trial.

Regimental commanders will visit the posts of the different detachments, inspect them, and see to the good order of the arms, accouterments, ammunition, and clothing, and to the condition of the commissariat.

By command of Major-General Buell:
