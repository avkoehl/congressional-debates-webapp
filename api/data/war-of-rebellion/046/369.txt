Graham's old camps have been burned and destroyed. Intelligence by a wounded man, who crept through marsh. Have ordered Graham to sent out a force to drive in their pickets.

FORT SUMTER, July 18, 1863.

Brigadier-General Taliaferro will soon be here; will order as soon as I learn situation fully from him. There are troops enough to hold now on island; whether practicable to get more there before morning, doubtful. The enemy made three assaults; badly repulsed. One hundred prisoners; one lieutenant-colonel and one major. The dead cannot, of course, be estimated at present. Our pickets are thrown well to the Point.

SUMTER, July 18, 1863.

We still hold the battery, and have been re-enforced by Harrison's regiment. Pickets have been thrown far in advance, insomuch that Sumter has been requested to cease firing. General Hagood has gone over with his staff and General Taliaferro is expected to return; more news expected soon.

FORT SUMTER, July 18, 1863.

(Received 12.15 p. m.)

The enemy have been repeatedly repulsed from Battery Wagner - I believe with great loss. We have lost heavily. Brigadier-General Hagood arrived with Harrison's regiment, and I doubt not has made good the battery, a portion of which the enemy had possession of. Whether it will be tenable to-morrow, I shall know in a short time. I doubt whether the ships will stop shelling, though the land forces will have enough to do.

Some of our losses are: Lieutenant-Colonel [J. C.] Simkins, killed; Major [David] Ramsay, wounded; Captain [William H.] Ryan, killed; Lieutenant [T. D.] Waties, wounded; Captain [W. T.] Tatom, wounded, and many others.

I have ordered the steamer Chesterfield to report here, to act when I hear from Generals Taliaferro and Hagood, before moving.

The transportation of Clingman's troops to Sullivan's Island I fear will be delayed.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
