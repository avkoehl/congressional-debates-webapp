HEADQUARTERS TENTH CORPS,June 22, 1864.

Colonel SHAFFER, Chief of Staff:

I shall order General Marston to Wilson's Wharf. Can't you send more of those new troops to Norfolk and give me one of those regiments of heavy artillery there?

W. T. H. BROOKS,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel SHAFFER:

General Turner reports 225 officers and 5,319 men present equipped for duty in his division.

HEADQUARTERS TENTH CORPS,June 22, 1864-2.35 p.m.

General WEITZEL, Chief Engineer:

I have just been over to see Foster's position. His picket-line was not fifty yards in front of him. His vedettes had been driven out of the Grover house. I suggested to him to try and get the house back and hold it with a company of infantry; that his picket-line ought to be advanced to the crest running close behind the house. I think it would be more convenient to get to his position to move the bridge up stream about 100 or 150 yards opposite to the mouth of the ravine running down from the work he is building. What has become of the 100-days' men? I can't hear of any returning.

W. T. H. BROOKS,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

June 22, 1864.

General BROOKS:

I agree with you about the position of the bridge, but I was ordered to put it where it would be shortest. The place you speak of would be somewhat longer. I directed General Foster to keep 600 of them until this evening. The other 1,200 ought certainly to be on their way back.

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH CORPS,June 22, 1864.

General WEITZEL, Chief Engineer:

There are pontoons enough for the bridge at the point I recommend. I don't believe it would be twenty yards longer and less exposed to an enfilade from below. I think a battery on the hill by the slaughter-house would help keep the bluffs below clear.

W. T. H. BROOKS,

Brigadier-General.
