HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 14, 1864-2.15 p. m.

General WILLIAM:

I have just received your order to issue two day's salt meat to the troops and send back the wagons. We issued one day's salt meat this a. m.; the rest is back with the supply train at Fredericksburg, and my quartermaster, says it almost impossible to get it up the old road. If we can have the straight pike guarded it can be done with ease.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 14, 1864-5.15 p. m.

General WARREN:

General Wright, from the Anderson house, is directed with his corps to regain the hill from which Upton has just been driven. You will co-operate in such way as he may desire, either with your batteries or by supporting him with infantry.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

WRIGHT'S HEADQUARTERS,

May 14, 1864.

Major-General WARREN:

As soon as my troops are in position I shall move forward. Russel, on the right, is instructed to keep connection with your left.

I will open with two batteries as soon as I am ready.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]

General GRIFFIN:

Read his and tell General Ayres to move up carefully till he sees a good chance, or Wright's batteries begin, as he says they will. At that time he may expect General Russell to operate from his left.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

SIXTH CORPS,

May 14, 1864-6.15 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

About an hour ago or more the enemy attacked Colonel Upton, and before I could learn anything about what was going on he was driven from the hill. He had not force enough to hold them back. Shall I retake if I can? Artillery at the Anderson house, in connection with mine would make the place untenable for the enemy, and I have asked General Wright to put some there.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
