the road to Lewinsville, on knoll covering the country to the right, the center section of the same battery, with four companies of the Second Wisconsin; and one mile farther on the remaining section, under the immediate command of Captain Mott, the Thirty-third New York, and the company of Kentucky cavalry, Captain Robinson, all at Mackall's House; the Third Vermont and the remainder of the Nineteenth Indiana being thrown out as skirmishers on the left and acting as a reserve, I placed the Pennsylvania battery, Captain Barr, with five companies of the Sixth Maine, about 300 men, and in advance to their right one section of Captain Griffin's battery, with three companies of the Fifth Visconsin, and in the edge of the wood the second battalion of the First California Regiment. Captain Grioffin's remaining sections occupied the hill, about one mile and a half from Lewinsville, covering the country to the left and road in front with the first battalion of the First California, Colonel Baker, five companies of the Fifth Wisconsin, the Bardan Sharpshooters, two companies of the Philadelphia Zouaves, and Lieutenant Drummond's company of the regular cavalry forming the center; six companies of the Seventy-ninth New York, half a mile in advance as skirmishers, supported by the two remaining companies of the Seventy-ninth and the Second Vermont; our fore in all 5,100 infantry, 16 pieces of artillery, and 150 cavalry.

There being at his time no signed of the enemy, with the exception of a few cavalry scouts, I ordered the quartermasters to load his wagons, ninety in number, all of which was accomplished by 3 o'clock, and got them well on their way home with all the forage they could possible carry. I them sent orders to draw in the skirmishers, and at 4 o'clock, as they were moving in, some of the Seventy-ninth Regiment captured a prisoner purporting to be an acting aide of Colonel Stuart, who he stated to be within a mile of us. Word at his moment was scent to that the enemy were approaching, and we could see advancing over the hills from the Falls Church road what seemed to be a large regiment, marching rapidly in close column and others deployed as skirmishers, with the apparent intention of turning our flank. At the same time they opened fire with seemingly one gun on our extreme left, but at too great distance for any effect, which ceased entirely, at which I ordered the center cession of Griffin's battery back to the California regiment in the wood, and covering the ground for our retreat, should it be necessary. Theirs cavalry was seen in small bodies, moving through the corn fields and woods to our left and on the Lewinsville road. At 4.30 they had placed two guns in position to our to our right at about 2,500 yards, and opened on Mott's section at Mackall's, which was at once replied to by Griffin's and the rifled and the rifled piece of Mott's section. After firing some thirty rounds, some of our shell exploding just in front of them, they limbered to the rear, and we could see their dust as they retreated on the Falls Church road.

At 5.30 I ordered Colonel Taylor, with Mott's section, to fall back slowly on the road to Langley, ready to come into battery should they follow him (there then being no signs of the enemy), and I retired the center and reserve by the fields, marching in columns by the flank, to the road within a mile of my quarters, arriving at camp by 7 o'clock. Just after dusk word was brought in that four or fire shots had been fired into Langley, they having brought one piece to the hill commanding the cross-road at that place; but by the time a scout could be sent out all had retired, and the road was clear for the distance of a mile and a half.

The firing from Griffin';s section was most excellent, and I would par
