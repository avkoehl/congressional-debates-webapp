CAIRO, ILL.,

March 24, 1864-11.45 a. m.

Captain PENNOCK, Commanding:

I have just received a dispatch from Columbus stating that the enemy were advancing on Columbus in force. Communication with Colonel Hawkins at Union City has been cut off and nothing heard from him since 3 o'clock this morning. Think it would be advisable to send a gun-boat to Columbus at once, if possible.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. MUNROE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CAIRO, March 24, 1864.

Brigadier General M. BRAYMAN, Columbus:

I will try to get a gun-boat to you this evening. Please keep me informed.

A. M. PENNOCK,

Fleet Captain and Commander Station.

CAIRO, March 24, 1864.

General BRAYMAN:

Captain Pennock is here and will do all in his power to have a gun-boat sent to Columbus as soon as possible.

Do you want any more troops sent down?

JNO. H. MUNROE,

COLUMBUS, March 24, 1864.

Captain MUNROE:

You need not send any more troops. Have not got boats for what we have. Will return to-night. Colonel Hawkins surrendered at 11 a. m. General directs that you do not allow any reporters to give the stories afloat, but leave the reports for him to sign.

J. H. ODLIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
