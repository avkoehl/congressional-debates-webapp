CLARKSBURG, August 19, 1863.

Colonel MOOR,

Beverly:

General Averell left Petersburg this morning on an expedition into Pocahontas and Greenbrier Counties. He will probably arrive at Huntersville on or about the 25th instant. You will order the Tenth [West] Virginia Infantry and the Second [West] Virginia Mounted Infantry and one section with General Averell at Huntersville,and report to him for orders.

The troops will move without camp equipage, taking with them ten days' rations of hard bread, sugar, coffee,and salt, and will depend on the country through which they march for forage and beef. Would suggest your order the infantry and artillery to get off one day in advance of the cavalry.

B. F. KELLEY,
