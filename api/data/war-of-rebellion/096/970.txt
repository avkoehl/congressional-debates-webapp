General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

Four deserters from Fifth North Carolina Cavalry have just been received. They belong to Barringer's brigade, Lee's division. They left the rebel lines at 9 o'clock last night, and report a movement of the enemy's cavalry yesterday morning at 9 o'clock toward Dinwiddie Court-House; know of no other movements of troops. They have heard that Sherman was at Fayetteville, N. C., and Sheridan at Lynchburg. His recent operations have produced much demoralization. Officers are deserting as well as men.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.
