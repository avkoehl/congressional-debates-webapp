DECATUR, ALA., October 29, 1864-7. 30 a. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

Colonel Morgan has this moment returned from reconnoitering the position he contended for yesterday. The battery is removed from there. He thinks the enemy is moving around to the right. We would much prefer to have him there. It would not surprise me if further reconnaissance, which I shall push out immediately, should show that he is gradually withdrawing.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

(Same to General Rousseau.)

DECATUR, ALA., October 29, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

We have felt the enemy very heavily upon the right and left all the morning. Upon their right we found them too strong to interfere with, outside of support from the fort. They still present a line of skirmishers from two and a half to three miles long and are thoroughly intrenched, except upon our extreme right, where we skirmished with them heavily. I will keep them constantly reminded of my presence.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

DECATUR, ALA., October 29, 1864-10 a. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

The indications are the enemy is moving west. Their column could be seen a few minutes since moving in that direction two miles south of our works. They still retain a strong skirmish line in their rifle-pits, 1,000 yards from our works.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

DECATUR, ALA., October 29, 1864-2. 40 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

The following information has just been received:

ATHENS, October 29, 1864.

Brigadier-General GRANGER,

Decatur:

Two scouts from Elk River informed me just now that a large force is crossing below Florence.

CHAS. A. BECKERT,

Captain and Provost-Marshal.

I will send a regiment from here, a soon as I think it safe to do so, to the mouth of Elk River. The force you spoke of coming from Missouri ought to be sufficient to attend to Lee and Forrest, that are supposed to be crossing at Florence.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.
