CINCINNATI, July 28, 1863.

General BOYLE:

Bring as much infantry force as you can from the Louisville and Nashville road to Louisville, and send it to Frankfort and Lexington. The enemy drove our force out of Richmond to Kentucky River. He is reported very strong, but not reliable. Will telegraph you again very soon. How much force can you send, and when?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

Captain SEMPLE:

Order Thirty-fourth Kentucky to Lexington, and Twelfth Kentucky and any other troops to be spared.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

General HARTSUFF:

You ought to be able to get together, by morning 1,500 or 2,000 cavalry, with a battery, and move it out to attack the enemy. Colonel Maltby left Mount Sterling at 3.30 this afternoon. Byrd's mounted meant are now at Camp Nelson. It would be well to commence then concentration at once. Keep the roads well watched, to prevent the enemy from striking across by Winchester and Paris. Two regiments and a section left here soon after you did. I ordered one to stop at Paris, with a section of artillery, and one to go on to Lexington. Don't fail to concentrate your cavalry to-night, and eat it move on the enemy to-morrow.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, July 28, 1863.

Lieutenant-Colonel DRAKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Direct Sanders to gather up what he can, and fall back, if forced, toward Lexington. Direct General Hascall to assume direction of the defense with what force he has. About 600 men and a section of battery will start in the regular train. If any very important news arrives while I am on the road, send it to General Burnside.

GEO. L. HARTSUFF,

Major-General.

Colonel SANDERS, Lexington:

I have ordered forces to report to you immediately from Danville, Camp Nelson and Mount Sterling. A battery will come with troops
