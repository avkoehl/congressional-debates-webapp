lent, a* it^was afterwaids discoveied, to the edi-
tor  f the " Courier des Etats Unís," by a third,
w«h permission to use it for any purpose what-
ever. Extracts were published from the pam-
phlet in that paper, and in several other news-
papers ; and the copy in the hands of the editor
of the French journal wa-> lent without scruple,
on no condition, but that, after being copied, or
otherwise used, it should be returned The du-
plicate copies sent to the diplomatic corps were ob-
viously intended to give the most extensive circu-
lation to the matter* contained in the pamphlet, and
no doubt one was expected to be transmitted to
each foreign Government represented in the Uni-
ted States, and the other to adorn the archives of
its legation in Washington From the equivocal
circumstances under which the pamphlet mas pre-
pared, and the asseitions contained in the preface,
it was supposed that the wnter sought to evade of-
ficial íeaponsibility, by representing the publica-
tion as hispi-rsonal act, thus giving tohimsell and
bts Government the benefit he hoped to den\e
from his defamation of the United States, with all
the Governments of Europe, and with Ins own
countrymen, among whom it was widely distri-
buted as soon as he reached the Mexican termor),
osa prelude to his last report to his own Govern-
ment, withoqt exposing that Government to a de-
mandifor redi es  foi ihe injury sought to be in-
flicted by its representative The slandcis oí a
private individual could not be ol importance to
the United States, but as the position of Mr Go-
renttza was equivocal, it was deemed necessaiy
that this subject should be so presented to his Go-
vernment, that the distinction made between his
acts, as a mere citizen, as the representative agent
nl Mexico, should be marked and tecognised Oc-
0 is,on wis taken, therefore, in giving instructions,
on li e 10th ot December last, lo Mr. Ems, to malte
(he explanations previously promised in regaid io
ihe movement of the troops under General Games,
to direct him to bnug the act of their Minister to
the notice of the Mexican Government, in these
words
" It would be gratifying to the President if this
communication, which you will have to make to
the Mexican Government, was limited lo these ex-
planations Unfortunately, the conduct of Us late
Mimslei 1 \'i uudiniry In* made itnectssaiy to

will learn with astonishment that Mi Goiosti'i,
\iluli- enjovjnr in-- d pieman privilege, althouji
ullei ne had dee Idled h s miss on at an md, pub
lislied, on Ins own .uithori j, a pamph'et, (a copy

ican Secietai y ol Foiegn Keiaiions, with along

Tl e e\li-**- *nm hi--correspondence with lus own
Government, and his introduction lo the «hole,
contain statements and comments defamatory ot
the Government and peopk of the Untied Siates,
and obviously iniended to injure the character of
both, for honor and good faith, m the eyes of the
world. This pamphlet, although not cnculateJ
generally among our citizens, was in the hands of
editors of newspapers, who have published extiacts
from it, and the President has been informed that
two copies of it wete sent by its author, at the
moment of his depaiture from the United State,
to some, if not to all, the members of the foreign
diplomatic body accredited here This act, still
more extraordinary because it almost immediately
tollo ed the communication of the President's in-
tention to direct that explanations, which he be-
lieved «ould be satisfactory, should be made to the
Mexican Government, has exeited but one senti-
ment anions those to whom it is know n In di
rectmgyou to make known the publication of this
pamphlet to the Mexican Government, the Presi-
dent ijoes in i doubt the truth of the declaration
made by it-, a ithor, that this publication was his
on a peisoaal act, for which he had no authority
f m hi* Government, nor will he permit himself tj
suppose, fo" an instant, that u will adopt or sanc-
tion oi'iiduu so glaringly violating all the decorum
ol diplomatic usage, so disrespectful to the Govern-
ment and people of the United Siates, so unworthy
the representative of a respectable Government,
and so well calculated to interrupt the harmony and
good will which ought to subsist between the United
States- and Mexico.
" How lar the character of the Mexican Go-
vernment for decorum and justice, and an honoia-
ble desire to maintain a respectable rank among
the civilised nations of the world, requires a dis-
tinct manifestation of its just displeasure at such
an extiaordmaiy step, are questions thai belong to
itself alone to consider and decide
" In giving you this instruction to make known
to the Mexican Government the conduct of its
Envoy, uuhout a demand of reparation at its
hands, the President is uifluencrd, as well by the
explicit disavowal of ihe Envov of all participa-
tion on the piit of his Government, ui the act com-
plained ot, as by the sinceie conviction, airead;
etprtssed, that a step so reprehensible will not be
countenanced by it But if, contraiy to all just
expectation, the Mexican Government shall adopt
that act, or give  anrtion to it by appiovingoi
their Mmistei's conduct, the continuance ol diplo-
matic inteicomse between the two countiiescan no
longer bp eiihei usttul oi reputable to the United
States However painful may be the consequences,
the honoi of the American people requires of the
President lo ins'iuct yon, aslnow do, m thatevent,
to demand your pasports, and to return forthwith,
bringing with you all the archives oMhe legation
to the United States "
These instructions were not received by Mr
Kills befoie his depaiture lrom Mexico; but a copy
of iliem was subsequently liansmillecl totheMexi-
c an Government, through its Ohargé d'Affaiies, Mi
Castillo. Phoi u Mr. Ellis's departure, and
within a fortnight after Mr. Gorostiza's aitival al
the city of Mexico, the Mexican Government, af-
ter an alleged delay of what is called an act ol
justice to their Mmistei, waitm; for explanations
promised by the United Slates, sent a formal ap
proval of his conduct as their Mmistei at Wash-
ington When it was lecollected lhat, in the
exliacts ol the correspondence of Mi Goros-
ti7a, with lus own Government, which he had
himself published, the good faith of the United
St its was dnec ly impeached, and it was pre-
sumed, tint the publication ol lus pamphlet, and
i's distribution, at least m Mexico, was known to
Ins Government, it was deemed necessary to re-
quire from the Mexican authority a distinct disa-
vowal of the part of bis conduct which had been
considered offensive by the United States. No
doub was entertained that the Mexican Govtrn
ment would, without hesitation, declare that its
approbation of Mr Gorostiya's conduct did not
relate to the preparation, or publication, or use, of
the defamatory pamphH
The answer of the Mexican Government, now
received, defends the conduct of us Minuter
Mr Marline/ asserts, in conlormiiy with his in-
structions, that the Minister did nothing which was
uui requited b the dignity and interests oí Mex
ico. By the note of Mr Martinez, these facts
are admitted, on the part ol the Mexican Govern-
ment, that the pamphlet was prtpaied by its Mi-
nister, and printed m Philadelphia, in the Spanish
language, that some ropiei «ere left lo be tivei m
the United Slates, wilh a ipcommfnetorion a  to the
lime only when they were to be used, and the
time recommended wi-, as soon as there should be
a publication of it in Mexico, that the pamphlet
was extensively circulated on the coast oí Mex-
ico as soon as he arrived, and, on his journey to
the capiia!, by the returning Envoy Extraordi-
nary. On ihese admitted facls, the Government
declares that Mr Gorostixa acted conformably to
what was required by the dignity and interests of
Mexico Keeping out oí view, as entirely unim-
portant, the offensive charactei ot the pamphlet,
and the use made of it in the United States, the
Mexican Government han attempted, argumenta-
uyely, to prove that it did not appear that iheir Mi-
nister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraoidmary in-
tended to offend the United States, or to jeopard his
diplomatic character, by violaling established
usage. To sustain the first allegation, it is, said the
pamphlet was necessary for his vindication, in re-
lation to a past transaction—a negotiation not
pending, inasmuch as his mission was terminated;
thai it was m the Spanish language—if it had
been intended offensively it would have been
printed in Cnghsh, for cuculation among the peo-
ple ol the United States, and that he did not circu-
late it among his colleagues of the diplomatic body,
becuwt he did not send it to them officially, or eon-
lidentially, with an explanation of his. object The
chat act ! of the production, and the use made of
the copies left, with the recommendation as to
lime, are, nnfoitunaic'y, the best evidences of the
intention of the author The pamphlet is a labored
efloil to prove lhat the United States, for asertes
ot jeais, soui'ht unjustly to obtain possession of
the teintoiy belonging to a friendly powei, till the
veai 1818, when, the Executive of the United
Siaies pretending to nothing but what was reasona-
ble, the Flouda treaty was negotiated, the negotia-
te s being both men ot talents and good faith, that,
subsequent!) to that treaty, the want of good
faith and integrity produced new pretexts to acquire
possession of the leintory, Ihe pretended claim to
which they had been thereby abandoned, that while
the Government was fostering the sinister design
of violating all the articles of their treaty with
Mexico, the Piesident and all his ministers were
pouting into the ear> of the Mexican Envoy Extra-
ordinary piotesiations of affection for his Govern-
ment, and of strict neutrality m the Texan con-
test, that this Government was destitute of good
faith, and that the people m mass, whh the excep-
tion of a minute fraction, described as belonging
to the school of Washington and Madison, were
necessarily ignorant, and, having every thing in
then power, could be b'iwlly led by dishonest,
greedy, unprincipled, and, consequently, unbridled
flatterers, wheiever they pleased. The assertion
that such a pamplet was not intended to offend the
United States, is so extraordinary that it is to be
hoped that the Maxican Government has omitted to
examine it Such a declaianon, m regard to its
intention, rannot otherwise be lationally accounted
foi, unless it be supposed that that Government
means to make this singular distinction, that a pro-
duction intended to impeach the character of a
Goveitiment and people, for honor and good faith,
and to degrade them in the eyes of the world, was
not intended to offend. The argumentative dental
of the act of sending this defamatory pamphlet to
foreign ministers, that the calumny against this
Government and people might be made known to
all the Governments with whom they hold diplo-
matic inteicourse, which has been made foi Mr.
Goiosti/a, amounts to this that he did not send
copies to them at all, becan-a he did not send them
with an official explanation lie left them heie
t<be used they viere Used—sent to foreign minis-
ters Iiis(oi the Envoy Extraoidmary to explain
how they came Ihere His Government, which has
approved his conduct as conformable lo its dignity
and interests, is responsible to those whose honor is
involved m the inquiry The contents of the pam-
phlet show, al o, that the intention of it was not
vell-vind.caiiüii Hi" responsibility oi the author
for the act on which it is alleged he designed to en-
lighten lus country, was to his Government, and
through it to the people of Mexico His pamphlet
is written for all places, and foi all times, a part is
specially for the meridian of the United States, as
will satisfactoi ily appear by a reference to its con-
tents But it is also said that it related to past
transactions—not secret, as some of the correspond-
ence had been made publ c A part of the corre-
spondence between the two Governments had been
published by the United States In addition to the
residue ot that coirespondence, the pamph'et con-
tains the Envoy's extracts from the secret and con-
fidential letters to hi  own Government, m which
he calk in question the good faith of the Govern-
ment of the United States His extraordinary mis-
sion was terminated by the act of the Envoy, but
he was still in the enjoyment of his diplomatic pri-
vileges, ami the subject of which he wrote was then
pending with his Government. After his letnrn,
that Go/eminent looked for explanations ^hion
