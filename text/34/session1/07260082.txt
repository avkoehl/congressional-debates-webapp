August 30,
Indiana. He informed me that the gentleman
with whom he had paired was present in the city;
that-he was anxious to leave the city and return
home, in consequence of the illness of his wife.
I asked particularly on this point, " Are you
positive that the gentleman with whom you have
paired off is here He replied in the affirma-
tive. He said that he had been so told.
Mr. MILLER, of Indiana. There can be no
doubt in the matter. I handed Mr. Miller, the

from Mr. English, which he read.

that my colleague, Mr. Broom, has been seriously

that all further proceedings under the call be dis-
pensed with. I understand that some of the

paired off with Mr. Watson. Mr. Watkins is
at home; but Mr. Watson is here, and can answer
for himself.
Mr. WATSON. I paired off with Mr. Wat-
kins for the reason that it was indispensable that
I should go home. I have since returned; but as
the gentleman frqm Tennessee is still absent, I
have not felt at liberty to vote.
Mr. JONES. I move that Mr. Watkins be
excused.

Mr. WHEELER. I understand that all the
absentees except Mr. A. K. Marshall have been

the other absentees, under similar circumstances,
have been excused, I move that he be excusedfor
the reason that he is absent from the efty.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. H. MARSHALL. I have not heard any
member state of his own knowledge that my col-
league, Dr. Marshall, is in the city. I do not
think any member knows that he is in the city.
He may have left. I see no reason why he should
not be excused.
Mr. SNEED. I will state to the gentleman
from Kentucky,that I understand Dr. Marshall
is on his way to the House.
Mr. STEPHENS. I move, then, that all fur-
ther proceedings, under the call, be dispensed
with.
Mr. UNDERWOOD. I demand the yeas and
nays.
Mr. HOUSTON. I hope the gentleman will
withdraw his call for the yeas and nays; I under-
stand that Dr. Marshall is at the door of the
House.
Mr. UNDERWOOD. Then I will withdraw
the call.

now that the doors be closed for the purpose of
keeping members here ? [Laughter.]
The SPEAKER. It is not in order.
The question then recurred upon seconding the
call for the previous question.
Mr. CLINGMAN demanded tellers.
Mr. COBB, of Georgia. Before the gentleman
from North Carolina insists upon his demand for
tellers,! wish to make a single remark. I under-
stand that the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Camp-
bell] declines to allow me to make a motion to
strike out the proviso to the Army bill. To save
time, therefore, I desire to make this suggestion.
Mr. CAMPBELL. If the gentleman from
