PETERSBURG, May 5, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

The following telegram just received:

Your dispatch received at 12.30 p.m. You are authorized to halt Hagood's brigade at Petersburg until otherwise ordered. Remain in command of your present district until further orders, and assume command of all troops that may arrive therein. Should it be necessary call directly on War Department for assistance until your troops reach you.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

I have sent all the information I have received up to this time, 1.30 p.m.

G. E. PICKETT,

Major-General.

PETERSBURG, May 5, 1864.

General S. COOPER:

Following dispatch just received by signal from Cobb's Station, the nearest signal station to City Point on this side:

We can make nothing of City Point. We can see 4 men standing on platform dressed either in blue or black.

SHELTON,

Sergeant, at Cobb's.

I infer from this that the enemy have possession of City Point. I have but one regiment here. Troops are arriving from the South. Can't I detain them? Answer at once.

G. E. PICKETT,

Major-General.

PETERSBURG, May 5, 1864-3 p.m.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

I have sent you numerous telegrams this morning and fail to obtain an answer. The emergency is so great that I send a courier by train, to say that the enemy in force are coming up the river. The advance is now lying off City Point. I have very few troops here. One regiment, Clingman's, the City Battalion, and the militia. The artillery is composed of the Washington Artillery and two heavy guns, say twenty-one pieces, and no cavalry. Why have not my suggestions and entreaties been carried out about the iron-clads and torpedoes? You had better, if possible, either send troops or have trains ready to re-enforce this point, or from here to Richmond should the enemy land at Bermuda Hundred. General Beauregard has ordered me to remain here.

Your obedient servant,

G. E. PICKETT,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

This was sent to General Bragg and returned on the morning of the 6th instant marked in pencil "seen," as will appear on the second fold.

RIELY.
