communicating with army headquarters at Dalton before the business could be consummated. I transmit herewith original order from headquarters Department of the Cumberland, with receipt of Lieutenant-Colonel Griffith for prisoners indorsed therein.* Having completed business, I started back at 10 a. m. of the 5th and brought 12 citizens (women and children) whom the rebels had passed outside their lines. I was accompanied 1 mile this side of Ringgold by Lieutenant-Colonel Griffith and his adjutant. I arrived at Rossville at 4 p. m. and reported to Colonel Boone, who issued a pass for the citizens to proceed to Chattanooga. It would be proper perhaps to state that while inside the rebel lines I was treated with extreme courtesy and kindness. At night I was furnished with a guard from the First Middle Tennessee (rebel) Cavalry, and no property what-ever was molested during our stay there.

I was visited by a great number of officers from the camp at Tunnel Hill, and they all, without a single exception, treated myself and the escort with the greatest kindness and attention.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. W. VAN ANTWERP,

Captain Fourth Michigan, Commanding Escort and Flag.

Brigadier General J. A. RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff:

The Tennessee is rising rapidly. A regiment of mounted infantry went to Florence to-day to come up with boats. I think by to-morrow or next day boats can get over shoals. Troops are passing through Montgomery daily, going to Atlanta.

Rebel mail just brought in has letters dated Rome, Ga., January 29. Speak of movement of cavalry force to front, &amp;c.; also say that all Tennessee have re-enlisted for three years or the war, &c.

All speak of movement of their army and of cavalry to front. Will send few letters up to-morrow.

A scout just in from south side of river says ferries only guarded by small picket; Johnson's regiment opposite Florence. All the rest of Roddey's command have gone up toward Loarkin's [?] Ferry to oppose those officers said to be coming there.
