HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT Numbers 1, C. S. A.,New Orleans, September 16, 1861.

The Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR,

Richmond, Va.:

SIR: There will no doubt be an invasion of this place by the Black Republicans early in the fall. I respectfully ask that two brigadier-generals be ordered to report to me at as early a day as possible. The works around the city are expensive, and it is impossible for one person to attend to all matters pertaining to the service.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. E. TWIGGS,

Major-General, Commanding.

MOBILE, September 16, 1861.

Honorable L. P. WALKER,

Secretary of War:

SIR: In view of the opposition manifested here to the assignment of Brigadier-General Withers to the command at Mobile, I deem it proper to state that in my opinion the public good will be promoted by the order which it is understood the Department has given to that effect.

I have just returned from a visit to General Twiggs at New Orleans.
