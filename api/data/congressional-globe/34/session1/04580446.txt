- * There is a typogr^hical error of three hundred in one of
these two amounts in the original pamphlet, which we have
not felt authorized to alter, as it was doubtful in which
amount to make the alteration.
Here, «ir, ends the black catalogue.' It wdnld show to
the Senate, that those people who most deprecate th^vils
of slavery and traffic in hun)an flesh, when ,a protWUile
market can be found, can sell human flesh with as easy a
conscience as they sell other articles. The whole number
imported by the merchants and planters of Charleston and
.its vicinity were only two thousand and six!. Nor were the
slaves imported by the foreigners, and other American ves-
sels and owners, sold to the Carolinians, only in part. They
were sold, to the people ofthe western States, Georgia, New
Orleans; and a considerable quantity were sent to the West
Indies, especially when the market became dull in Caro-
lina.
It would appear from the foregoing, that of these import-
ations of slaves into Charleston there were imported—

Judge Smith's speech also contains much matter upon
the constitutional admission of the institution of slavery by
the Federal Constitution, and also by the constitutions of
many of the now non-slaveholding States, which is worthy
of revival.—Notes by the Compiler.
NAVAL RETIRING BOARD.
SPEECH OF HON. ASA BIGGS,
of north carolina,
In the Senate, April 30, 1856.
The Senate having resumed the consideration of the
resolutions submitted by Mr. Iverson, on the 29th of Feb-
ruary, for the appointment of a special committee to inves-
tigate the action of the late Naval Board-
Mr. BTGGS. Mr. President, I have attentively-
listened to the preceding debate on this interesting,
and what appears to be with some, the most im-
portant and absorbing question of the session. I
Ihink I have listened, too, with as much imparti-
ality as any Senator, because my judgment was
not influenced by a participation in the debate
preceding the passage of the law of the last Con-
fress. I was not committed by my vote, and I
ave no personal acquaintance with a member of
the naval board, nor with one officer of the retired
list, except a slight acquaintance recently formed
with one of the retired commanders. It seems
to me, therefore, that I have been favorably cir-
cumstanced to be guided by the unbiased convic-
tions of my beat judgment in arriving at a cor-
j rect conclusion.
I I have been somewhat pained at a portion of
the debate which degenerated into personal crim-
ination and recrimination, in which assaults and
defenses of the personal character of particular
officers of the Navy were indulged in.
It, perhaps, will not be becoming in me to ex
press an opinion as to the course that much older,
abler, and more experienced Senators have con-
sidered it their duty to pursue; but, with that
frankness and candor which I trust will charac-
terize my course as a member of this grave and
dignified body, I must express my entire disap-
probation of the course of debate of a question
of public policy which leads us into personali-
ties which engender strife, stir up the worst pas-
sions of depraved human nature, tear open wounds
nearly healed, and which remind us of the breach
of former friendships, encourages and aggravates
: ill feelings recently and for the first time aroused;
I and converts the Senate into an arena for personal
! invective and eulogy. In the privacy of a Cabi-
j net council, or in an executive session of the
! Senate, the fitness or unfitness of a nominee for
| office, morally, socially, physically,or otherwise,
| may be, and perhaps ought to be, fully discussed,
j arid the comparative merits of the nominee with
| his predecessor removed might not be out of
place; but it strikes me as exceedingly indiscreet
j and improper, upon the propositions now before
the Senate, to discuss the personal character of
any officer in the Navy.
What result will be attained by making these
personal issues ? In deciding a great question of
public policy are we to be guided by Sympathy
Tor retired officers—by the ciitmor of their inter-
ested friends—by a deriunciajiorvof the executors
of a law of the land, or by an examination of the
■personal faults of any officer of the Navy?
Sir, a great mistake we commit, in my huiribfe
-judgment, to act upon the principle here, (as
would seem to be indicated by the character of
the discussion,) that this Government is estab-
lished for the especial benefit of the office-holders,
be they civil, military, or naval. This Govern-
ment, according to my reading of our institu-
tions, was created for the benefit of the people of
this country, and the officers are their agents—
necessary agents, certainly, and to be treated
with liberality and justice by-the representatives
of the States and people—but to be changed, reg-
ulated, controlled, or dismissed, from the public
service when the great interests of the people re-
quire it; and it is a contempt of this cardinal
feature of our republican Constitution when any
set of office-holders under this Government, by
deed or word',- assume to themselves the charac-
ter of a privileged class.
It is our duty to examine with care, uninflu-
enced by favor, affection, or revenge, the impor-
tant questions upon which we are called to act;
and I admit that the Navy—its increase and effi-
ciency—is entitled to our favorable consideration.
In doing this we should do no injustice as far as
practicable to meritorious officers; but meritorious
