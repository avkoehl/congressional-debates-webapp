HEADQUARTERS SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS,November 21, 1864.

Brigadier General M. D. LEGGETT, Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: The major-General commanding directs that you move forward, taking the road to Fortville, at 10 o'clock, if possible. If you cannot move at that hour start as soon as you can.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. CADLE, Jr.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Vann's House, November 21, 1864.

General J. C. DAVIS, Commanding Fourteenth Corps:

GENERAL: I am directed by the General-in-chief to say that at Lawrence's, about three miles and a half from your quarters, the road forks--the one leading to the right, on which Morgan now is, is the longer but somewhat the better; by the left there is a ford to pass the Cedar Creek. He thinks you will do well to send two divisions, the engineers, and the pontoon train by the right-hand road, and one division by the left hand and ford. Inclosed is a small sketch* by Captain Poe. The distance by the left is about sixteen miles from the fork to Milledgeville, touching the railroad some five miles from it, but not intersecting the road by which the Twentieth Corps is marching. Both your columns will enter Milledgeville about the same point. The general wishes your columns kept pretty compact, regardless of the time it takes you to reach Milledgeville.

I am, General, respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Murder Creek, GA., November 21, 1864.

Brigadier General J. D. MORGAN,

Commanding Second Division, Fourteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Your march has been a good one to-day, except perhaps a little remissness on the part of your train guards is not pushing up the trains. You will remain in your present camp until further orders, General Baird's division will take the advance to-morrow. This will give you the greater part of the day in which to rest, &c., secure the crossing at Cedar Creek, picket well, and give the Michigan Engineers any help they may desire to work the roads.

Yours, very respectfully,

JEF. C. DAVIS,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
