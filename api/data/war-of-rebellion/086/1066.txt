[General E. K. SMITH:]

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 18th instant, in reference to Wharton's cavalry and the selection of a suitable part of the country for their winter quarters-one which would afford them facilities for foraging and at the same time opportunity for instruction and drill. You will perceive by the inclosed General Orders, Numbers 80,* that I have already provided for the protection of the cotton in charge of Captain Polk, assistant quartermaster, and also that I have selected Brigadier-General Steele's brigade as the most available one to remain until such time as the cavalry of Major-General Price shall have recovered sufficiently to replace it. This will probably not be the case for a month or two. I would state that owing to the fact that Wharton's train of wagons has been sent to Laynesport to convey provisions for Major-General Price's command, it is probable that they (Wharton's cavalry) will not be able to move until the return of this train.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,

Major-General, Commanding, &amp;c.
