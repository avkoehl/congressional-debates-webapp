CUMBERLAND CITY, [February] 12, [1862.]

Governor ISHAM G. HARRIS, Nashville, Tenn.:

One gun-boat made its appearance in sight of Fort Donelson this morning about 10 o'clock and opened a fire on the fort without injury, which fire the fort returned, when the boat retired. The Federals have landed in force, and the battle with light artillery commenced this evening. They are reported to have 10,000 or 12,000. We have the same number, probably more, to meet them. The steamer giving this news says when it left the battle was raging, but knows nothing further. I will telegraph you as fast as the news comes. Generals Pillow and Buckner are there.
