GENERAL: I will send Captain Lyon and Lieutenant Nelson to Hillsborough. I think we will get through to-night. There should be two good regiments here at once. This whole army is dissolving and raising the devil. We [must] have men to guard ordnance stores.

Lieutenant Colonel THEODORE COX,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Let the First and Second Division start in the morning for this place. Let the Third Division come by cars as fast as the superintendent of the railroad can furnish transportation. Let headquarters come by railroad. Telegraph me how rapidly the transportation can be furnished. The troops should have rations enough to last them through. I will determine in the a. m. whether I will come back to Raleigh.
