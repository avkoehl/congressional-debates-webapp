General [C. B. FISK]:

SIR: I am truly sorry to have to report the presence in our county of a band of bushwhackers, seriously estimated at from 30 to 90 men. They made an attack upon the post at New Market on yesterday about 12 m. They took possession of all the arms, and what they could not carry they destroyed.

I received a dispatch from Captain Woods at 1 o'clock this morning he was on their track. There is another force, under Lieutenant Hawkins, on this side of the Platte River, trying to intercept them.

I will do my utmost to
