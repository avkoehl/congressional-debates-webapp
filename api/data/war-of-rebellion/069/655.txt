General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: The enemy are pressing our right very heavily. The pickets have been driven in on the front of General Potter, who was swung to the rear last evening, and are also pressing the line of skirmishers of General Crittenden. Our entire line is a single one, owing to its great length, but we hope to retain our position. It is possible that the attacking force is a light one, but we shall ascertain the strength of it very soon.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
