Nothing for the general. My scouts have not reported from Springfield to-day yet. Please tell the general to push on with all practicable speed. I will have forage and rations in readiness for him.

Brigadier-General AVERELL:

A dispatch, just received from New Creek, informs me that the pickets have been driven in at that place. I presume it is McNeill's and a portion of McCausland's force. Please push on as rapidly as possible.

SIR JOHN'S RUN, August 4, 1864.

General B. F. KELLEY,

I will move as fast as I possibly can. Send dispatches after me advising me of all news, so that I may direct my course right. You cannot expect me to help New Creek.
