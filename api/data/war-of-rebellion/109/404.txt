INDIANAPOLIS, July 12, 1863.

General WALLACE:

Better send Burkham's command at once to Lawrenceburg with orders either to guard that point, if Morgan is marching up, or to take boats, if Morgan is striking below. Can you send couriers to Madison?

INDIANAPOLIS, July 12, 1863.

Major-General WALLACE:

Dispatch received. Can you not get through to Madison by rail, leaving Hughes as indicated this morning and guards at bridges? If Morgan has the force represented could he not take Madison, unless it is re-enforced? Has Burkham's command got through to Lawrenceburg?

O. B. WILLCOX.

Is the way clear to Madison by rail? If so, has you not better prepare to move part of your force down there, either to fight or embark aboard steamers to other points? Have you communication with Hobson? Give me all the information you can to guide me in reference to the river.
