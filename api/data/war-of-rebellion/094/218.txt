GENERAL STEEDMAN'S HEADQUARTERS, December 16, 1864.

Major General G. H. THOMAS:

The enemy have abandoned this part of their line and seem to have moved toward the right. I now occupy Riddle's Hill, and will press forward carefully toward the enemy. Prisoners say their wagon train is on road to Franklin.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

NASHVILLE, December 16, 1864.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

GENERAL: On my way out to my command I stopped a moment at General Cruft's quarters to endeavor to communicate with you for orders. I pushed out on the Nolensville pike and joined General Wood at a critical juncture, aiding him to carry the enemy's right. I went without orders, but I hope you are not displeased with my movements. I am on General Wood's left with about 3,000 men, and desire to know your wishes. I went out without anything but ammunition, not expecting to move more than a mile; but feeling that I could best protect the left by keeping well around the flank, I pushed on until I made the jnction with General Wood, and went into camp on his left at dark.

With esteem, yours, truly,

JAMES B. STEEDMAN,

Major-General.
