HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, September 28, 1864-11.50 p.m.

Major-General Meade,Commanding:

After the musketry affair was over, I received the following report from General Ferrero,commanding Third Division:

I have the honor to report that the attack was made on the Second Corps, and did not reach my line.

E. FERRERO,

Brigadier-General.

From my quarters all the artillery firing appeared from Fort Davis and works to the right. The musketry seemed to be about the junction of our pickets and those of the Second Corps. It was accompanied with slight cheering, and seemed an attack on our picket-line, but on receiving General Ferrero's report I made no further investigation. I will, however, send to him and learn if he has any further information from his line.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
