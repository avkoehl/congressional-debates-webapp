rity by which they are issued, the purposes for
which thtj may oe used, the mode in which their
ultimate solvency and payment are guaranteed,
constitute their character, and give them a greater
or less circulation The notes of the late Bank of
the United States were issued under the authority
of Congress. They were made receivable from
one end of the continent to the other, as equivalent
to gold and silver, in the payment of the revenue.
The wnole community took them with confidence,
because a large poit on of the capital pledged for
their redemption belonged to the United States,
because the issue of them w as limited to the dura-
tion of the charter, and because the conduct of
those who issued and circulated them was placed
immediately under the supervision of Congress
From the'e causes, the notes of the late Bank of
the United States derived their extensive credit
among the people , and this credit, thus derived,
imposes upon Congress the corresponding obhga-
t on, to taice care that no act of omission of theirs
-hall mislead the community, when these causes of
peculiar credit to these notes have ceased to exist.
On the 3d of March, 1836, when the charter of
the bank terminated, the bank notes which it had
issued amounted to mil}-four millions four bun-
dled and thirtj-four thousand two hundred and
seventy dollars and sixteen cents. On these it had
on hand thirteen millions three hundred and twenty-
four thousand nine hundred and seventeen dollars
and nmety-thiee cents These notes, thu  on hand
at the expiration of the charter, it was the obvious
duty of the bank immediately to cancel , they
were obligations originally issued under a chaiter
which had expired , they had been returned mto
the bank, 'hey foimed no part of its property to
be collected oí d i ided Yet on th  2d of April
following th  State institution, in its first report to
tae Legislature of Pennsylvania, declared the
amount of its notes issued to bethnty-six mil'ions six
hundred and twenty thoutand four hundied and
twenty dollars, and sixteen cent*; of which it had
then on hand, notes of the Bank of the United
States to the amount of sixteen millions seven
hundred and mnetj-four thousand seven huudred
and thirteen dollars and -eventy-one cents, thus
showing that the directors of the bank chartered
bv Congr s=, m transferring "all their money, goods,
ai d chattels" to the i trustee, had delivered up the
bank notes vhich ought to have been cancelled,
andwluJi were e itirely unnecessary fot winding
up the coneeirs of the bank, oi pcrfoiming any of
the üusl duties undeitaken by that trustee The
pnctice ihns adopted, of keeping instead of can-
celling the notes issued under the authority of the
char ei lrow C ingress, after that chaiter had ex-
pu\l vas not confined to those thus improperly

years in which ti e afluH  of the bankwcie to have
bren settled are nearly expired, when the control
(such as it is) that Congress may yet possess is
almost at an end, about sixteen millions of dol-
l-ii-., in bank notes which bear the name of the
United Sta'es, and were actually made under the
authon / of Congress, which, if put in circulation,
% ill be rii'uiilH a',d reasonably cons dered by
those who til e them ?s giaranteert by Congress,
are now in the exclusive possess on oí a banking
ni titut on u 11 "h has the powei to use them when
and toi «! at pur x-s^s it pleases
liven it it couid be said that these b?nk notes
would nji be u jd foi pinposes of cnculat on and
ourrencj, even U it were certain that these evi-
dences ot the liability of the United Slates would
not be put forth after that liability was at an end,
even if the trustee who has obtained possession of
them had evinced a determination to cancel them,
as the redeemed obligations of a concern which
ought to he wound up -without delay, still, it is
a duty imposed upon Congress, who originally
authorized their feue, to see that this is done, to en-
force, by law, and not to leave to the discretion or
honesty of any individual or corporation, that which
the whole American people have a right to look
for at their hand .
But is not that duty absolutely forced upon them,
when those who have thus obtained possession of
these uncancelled notes of an extinct corporation
actually use them for purposes of circulation, and,
in defiance oí the charter, boldly issue them as a
lawful currency and for their own individual pro-
fit? Yet not only is this the case They claim the
legitimate right so to use and issue them. The
trustee who receives and accepts the property of
the late bank, under the pledge to redeem its notes,
debts, and obligations, unequivocally assert  the
right, not merely to refuse to cancel the notes for
the redemption of which funds have been con-
veyed, but actually to pay out these note  as
other banks might do who íeceived them m the
oidinary transactions of trade "The Bank of the
United States chartered by the State of Penns) 1-
vama, has," in the deliberate language of its own
director , "done as other banks have done—paid
out the notes of the Bank of the United States," as
if there was the slightest similarity between a bank
which receives, by a general transfer, sixteen mil-
lions of dollars in bank note  that had been regu-
larly issued and returned to the institution bj which
they were made, and those banks which receive
the notes of one another in the ordinary course of
commercial dealing, and pay them out in the same
mode as if there was the least resemblance be-
tween the reissue of hank notes by a trustee who
had undertaken to redeem those notes, and had re-
ceived a large and sufficient amount of funds for
that object, and the bona fide payment of them by
a bank, foi the purpose of collecting thtir .imount,
and without any interest m them whatever, except
as a common medium of exchange. Between such
proceeding  there is no similau'), nor can the one
afford any justification to the other But is not
the course pursued by this institution, which has
received these notes lor the purpose of redeeming
them, and now boldly reissues them, in all respects
identical with that ol a partner who, having lund 
of an expired partnership in his hands, tor the pur-
pose of settlement, should use and reissue, in viola-
tion of all faith, the notes or obligations of his con-
fiding partner"! Is, it not similar to that of an execu-
tor, wno voluntarily assumes the duty of winding
up the eMate of a deceased testator, and ret seizes
upon the property confided to him in that ti ust, and
applies it to his personal benefit, and puts into cir-
culation, by himself and his agents, uncancelled
notes found among the papers of the testator, which
had been fully paid off and discharged'
Previously to the 1st of Jul}, 1837, the monthly
statements furnished to, and published b) , the Au-
ditor General of Per is)Kama, did not distinguish
between the business of the State bank an! thit of
its trustee, between the notes of the late and pre-
sent bank, issued or in circularon 'lhe mfor na-
tion tla> should thus have oeen fmn shed cannoi,

On the 1st Jul), 1837, houever, the not s of the

the notes of the late bank m circulation ate stated
at #6,175,861 05, but cn the 1st November fol-
lowing, at §6,522,839 40, which would show a
re-issue of notes that ought to have been cancelled,
amounting to upwards of $340,000 m less than a
month
Thus it appears, thatal'hough Coi gress e\pas-h
enacted, in granting the charter, that the banking
privilege  of the Bank of tne United States should
expire on the 3d of March, 1836, )et the most im-
portant of those privileges, so ftti as the commu-
nity is concerned—the issue of bank note-, mad^
under the provisions of the charter—ha  conti-
nued for twenty month  after that period, and
probably still continues, that although two years
Here allowed after the expiration of the char-
ter " for the final settlement and liquidit on
of'the affairs and accounts of the corporation,
and tor the sale and disposition of its estate,
butnt/lfo   any olha  jwposf," yet noiv, when ihe
two years are nearly at an end, there are in. ex-
istence, and ready to be re-issued, when, de-
sired, about $16,000,000 m bank notes, the cancel-
ling of which was one of the first and principal
duties of those who were "to settle and liquidate its
affairs." No provision was made m the charter
for such a state of things It is, therefore, proper
that Congress should at once provide for it by
appropriate legislation. Such is its duty, if the
principles of the charter which it granted are to be
fulfilled It is no infringement of any privilege ac-
tually conferred on any individual or corporation,
or intended to be by that charter, and it will at once
put an end to the erroneous impression which a
want of it will naturally establish, that the faith or
the property ot the United States continues to be
pledged for thp security of the bank notes bearing
the name of the United States, and originally
issued under that pledge It is due to consistency
that the terms and meaning of the charter should
be guarded and pteserved, it is due to good faith
that, when the properly oí the United States is
withdrawn, by the sale of the stock, from liability
for the redemption of the notes, they should not
stand by and permit them to be issued and circu-
lated among the community, exactly as they were
when that property formed a part of the capital by
which they were secured, it is due to their legisla-
tive functions that the right which they retained,
of examining into the proceedings of the bank,
and thus virtually promising the community the
exercise of a supervisory power, should not, at a
moment when it is most needed for the public wel-
fare, be neglected or relinquished, even though
their own direct interest has ceased by the bargain
they have made
IN or i  it with reference alone to the late or
present Bank of the United States that such legis-
lation is neccssarj The course adopted by those
institution  may be pur ued by every other bank-
ing institution chariered by Congres  The notes
issued in the District of Columbia, under the au-
thority of charters from the United States, may,
without greater impropriety, be reissued and cir-
culated after those charters have expired, either
by the banks themselves, 01 by trustees to whom
they may transfer them the day before their cor-
porate privileges terminate That some law
should be passed to prevent and obviate such a
proceeding, cannot admit 01 question.
In passing such a law, it is the duty of Con-
gress carefully to avoid any provision which
should affect the citizen who holds or receives
these notes in the ordinary course of trade, or
who passes 01 transfers them in good faith from
hind to hand It is only those who hold or re-
receive them with the means and foi the purpose
of redeeming them, who pass and circulate them
wnen they know that they have come into their
hand  for such a purpose and under such obliga-
tions, and who neglect or refuse to cancel them,
when they are bound to do so bv the intention ot
the charter under which the) wereonginall) made
Considering ibis subject, therefore, with refer-
ence to those relations of the United States towards
the late national bank and to the community which
are derived fiom the charter of that institution, a
promp' and efficient interference of Congress is un-
q íestionably demanded. They have derived large
profits fiom the cnculation of these notes, for the
lelemption of vhicn th°ir share of the capital
was pledged, and ihe\ have now withdrawn that
sh ire of the cipitil fiom its former liability, they
pi escribed by the cl alter that all banking privi-
lege , among vvtrch wis that of issuing these
notes, should terminate at a certain peuod, and
that period is now passed, they íeserved to them-
selves the right, and thus imposed on themselves
the duty, of examining that the stipulations of the
charter were fulfilled, and to do this the enactment
of such a law is now absolutely required.
But there are other considerations bearing di-
rectly on the present situation of the commerce and
business of the country, and on the respect due
from Congress to the laws and policy of the indivi-
dual State', which ought not to be overlooked.
It is a fact that the present Bank of the United
States is in actual possession, having them within,
its own vaults, and under its control, of a. fund
