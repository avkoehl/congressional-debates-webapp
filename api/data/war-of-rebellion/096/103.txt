Colonel N. WILKINSON,

Rebels approached Beverly on Daniels road from east of the town. Captain Evans, of Eighth [Ohio Cavalry], has just arrived. Says he was the last man that left there. Says it was a complete surprise, owing to the camp-guard being deficient. Most of the command captured in their quarters.

Two men belonging to the Eighth Ohio Cavalry have just arrived; report Beverly surprised at about 3 o'clock this morning. Rebels had surrounded the quarters when they left. They feel confident they have captured Beverly. Met wagon train about twelve miles from here. Suppose it turned back, as the wagon-master was informed of what had occurred. Say they saw a great quantity of smoke when seven miles from Beverly on the mountain. Suppose the place to be burned.

It is reported that Beverly was attacked and burned by rebels this morning. Send messenger immediately to Philippi, with directions that if forced to fall back, to take all the plank off the bridge and move toward Clarksburg or Webster, as may be most practicable. Advise your whole command to be on the alert.

Transportation for 800 men of Grover's command still lacking. The Oriental hourly expected. I have hurried the quartermaster and all parties, and if there were any ocean-going steamers here would seize them, but we know of none this side of Fort Monroe, if there are any there.
