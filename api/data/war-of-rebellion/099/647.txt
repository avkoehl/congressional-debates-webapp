Major MAX WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

MAJOR: In reply to your communication of last night, I respectfully report that I will be ready to march at 9 this a.m. It was 1 o'clock this morning before the bridge was completed, and crossing through the dark swamp this side the river was very difficult, the drivers constantly running off the road, delaying the crossing very much.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. R. WOODS

Brevet Major-General.

HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Kelly's Bridge, S. C., March 2, 1865-7 p.m.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL, HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE:

Owing to washing out of one of the trestles, the part of the bridge west of the old bridge gave way, and as the water has fallen the trestles can be laid flat upon the ground and covered. I had hoped the bottom was firm and that a bridge over this part would be unnecessary, but every part of it will have to be recovered. This will delay me a portion of the morning to-morrow.

I am, respectfully,

W. B. HAZEN,

Major-General.
