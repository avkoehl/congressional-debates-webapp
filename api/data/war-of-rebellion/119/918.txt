HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,Fort Monroe, Va., February 4, 1864.

Honorable ROBERT OULD,

Confederate Commissioner for Exchange:

SIR: David Wood, esq., comes to me with an open letter to General Lee, and claims that he has some private and personal business with the general.

I have taken his parole not to make any disclosure that will be injurious to the United States, and have permitted him to go to City Point.

I believe Mr. Wood to be loyal to the United States, but I have no acquaintance with him; you can let him go forward or not. I have no interest in the matter.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General and Commissioner for Exchange.

OFFICE COMMISSIONER FOR EXCHANGE,

Fort Monroe, Va., February 4, 1864.

Honorable ROBERT OULD, Agent for Exchange, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: I have the honor to call your attention to the case of Thomas Hill, a citizen of the United States . He was living in West Union, Doddridge County, W. Va., and was captured April 30, 1863, while building bridges for Government use by order of General Roberts. He has been offered frequent paroles of Richmond by the Confederate authorities, but has refused them. He will accept no protection but that of the United States Government. He is now liable to conscription by the Confederate Government, and is not a subject for exchange.

This Government is willing to exchange a Confederate citizen for him. If you should not accede to these terms, why should we not imprison a Confederate citizen as hostage for him?

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General and Commissioner for Exchange.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,Fort Monroe, Va., February 4, 1864.

Honorable ROBERT OULD,

Confederate Commissioner for Exchange:

SIR: I send Mr. Thomas Ritchie, a surgeon, captured at Brandon, and his two overseers.

I don not ask any exchange for Mr. Ritchie, because I think he comes fairly within the spirit that surgeons shall be exchanged.

For the two citizens (overseers) who go with him I desire that you would send me some citizens whom you hold of ours.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General and Commissioner for Exchange.
