Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN.

Asst. Adjt. General, Military Division of West Mississippi:

COLONEL: I have the honor to submit to your consideration the following report of information received at this office this 12th day of April, 1865: Captain B. Hudnall, Twenty-fourth Mississippi Cavalry, Moorman's battalion, gives the following roster of the companies of that regiment: Regiment commanded by Captain E. A. Miller. Captain John Wilkinson, Company C; Captain Thomas J. Hargrave, Company D; Captain James P. Beesley, Company E; Captain Joseph W. Devenport, Company F. The regiment numbers 200 men. It belongs to Adams's brigade, which includes Mabry's and Wood's (Mississippi) regiments. It has been detached from the brigade until very lately. They are now with Forrest. Captain Hudnall confirms the report that 200 of Ross' (Texas) brigade deserted in a body, leaving only 400 in the brigade. It was reported that Buckner had captured most of them. Forrest's entire effective force is not much over 6,000. The rendezvous for conscripts for the Military District of Mississippi, including Claiborne, Copiah, Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, Lawrence, Covington, Marion, Pike, Amite, and Wilkinson Counties, is at Brook haven. The headquarters for the conscript bureau for the State is at Enterprise. Negroes are beginning to arrive at the conscript camps. M. V. Cook, late telegraph operator at Amite Station, states that on the 4th instant having dispatches for Forrest, he inquires for him and received orders to send them to Selma. Forrest was supposed to be somewhere between that place and Montgomery.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,A. M. JACKSON,

Major, Tenth U. S. Colored Heavy Artillery.

(In absence of Captain S. M. Eaton, chief signal officer, Military Division of West Mississippi.)
