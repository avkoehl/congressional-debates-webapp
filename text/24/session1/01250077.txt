of it, 1i should have endeavored to persuade him
to wait until Mo.iday next, when he (Mr B.)

lorctd upon us i>o, (said Mi B ,) it has not
been ioi cd upon me, because T am glad to have
a suitable occasion of expressing my opinions
upon the subjt et
The memoiul which I have in my possession
is entitled to the utmost respect fiom the charac-
ter of the niemoinhsts. As I entirely dissent
from the opinion which tliev express, that we
ought to abolish slavciy in the District of Co-
lumbia, I feel it to be due to them, to myself and
to the Senate, respcctfullj, but firmly, to state
the reasons why I cannot advocate their views,
or acquiesce in their conclusions                            I
If any one principle of constitutional law can,
at this day, be considered as settled, it is, that
Congiess has no right, no power, over the ques-
tion of slav ery w lthm those States w here it exists
The propei ty of the mastei in his slave existed
in iull force before the Federal Constitution was
adopted. It was a subject which then belonged,
as it still belongs, to the exclusivejunsdiction of
the stveral States. These States, by the adop-
tion of the Constitution, never yielded to the
General Government any right to interfere with
the question. It remains wheie it was previous
to the establishment of our Confederacy.
The Constitution has, in the clearest terms,
recognized the right of property in slaves It
prohibits uiy State into which a slave may have
fled fiom passing any law to discharge him fiom
slavery, and declares that he shall be delivered
up by the authorities of such State to his master
>ay, more, it makes the existence of slavery the
foundation of political power, by giving to those
States in which it exists Representatives in Con-
gress not only in propoi Uon to the w hole number
of fiee persons, but also in pioportion to three
fifths of the number of slaves..
An occasion very fortunately arose in the first
Congress to settle this question forever. The
Society for the Abolition of Slavery in Pennsyl-
vania brought it before that Congress, by a memo-
rial which was presented on the 11th day of Feb-
ruary, 1790. Alter the subject had been discussed
for several days, and after solemn deliberation, i
the House of Representatives, in Committee of
the Wliole, on the 23d day of March, 1790, re-
solved—
" That Congress have no authority to interfere in the
emancipation ot slaves or in the treatmentef them within
any of the States, it remaining with liie geveral States
alone to provide any regulations tiiereui which humanity
and true pohev may require   '                          '               j
I have thought it vv ould be proper to present
this decision, which was made almost halt a cen-
tury ago, distinctly to the view of the American
people The language of the resolution ¡a clear,
precise, and definite. Itleaves the question where
the Constitution left it,and where,so far as I am
concerned, it ever shall remain. The Constitution
of the United States never would have been called
into existence—instead of the innumerable bless-
ings which have flowed from our happy Union,
we should have had anarchy, jealousy, and civil
war among the sister republics of which our
Confederacy is composed—had not the free States
abandoned all control over this question. For
one, whatever may be my opinions upon the ab- ,
stract question of slavery—and I am free to con-
fess they are those of the peopleof Pennsylvania—
I shall never attempt to violate this fundamental
compact. The Uruon will be dissolved, and incal-
culable evils will me from its ashes, the moment
any such attempt is seriously made by the free
States in Congiess
What, then, are the circumstances under which
these memorials are now presented > A number
of fanatics, led on by foreign incendiaries, have
been scattering "ariows, fiiebrands, and death"
throughout the southern States, The natural
tendency of their publications is to produce dis-
satisfaction and revolt among the slaves, and to
incite their wild passions to vengeance. AH his-
tory, as well as the present condition of the slaves,
proves that there can be no danger of the final
íesult of a servile wat. But, in the mean time,
what dreadful scenes may be enacted before such
an insurrection, which would snare neither age
nor sex, could be suppressed • What agony of
mind must be suffered, especially by the g< ntln
sex, in consequence of tin se publications ' Many
a mother clasps her infant to her bosom, when
she retires to lest, undei dieadful apprehensions
that she maybe aroused from her slumbers by
the savage yells of the slaves by whom she is
surrounded These are the w orks of the Aboli-
tionists. That their motives may be honest, I do
not doubt, but their zeal is without knowledge
The history of the human race presentí numer-
ous examples of lgnoiant enthusiasts, the purity
of whose intentions cannot be doubted, who have
spread devastation and bloodshed ovei the face
of the earth.
These fanatics, instead of benefiting the slaves
who are the objects of their regard, have inflicted
serious injuries upon them Self-preservation is
the first law ofna'ure The masteis,forthe sake
of their wives and children—foi the sake of all
that is neai and dear to them on earth—must
tighten the reigns of authority over their slaves
They must thus counteract the efforts of the Ab-
olitionists The slaves are denied many indul-
gences which their masters would otherwise
cheeifully grant, they must be kept in such a
state of bondage as effectually to prevent their
rising. These are the injurious effects produced
by the Abolitionists upon the slave himself
Whilst, on, the one hand, they render his condi-
tion miserable by presenting to his mind vague
notions of fieedom never to be realized, on the
other, they make it doubly miserable by compel-
ling the master to be sev ere, in order to prevent any
attempts at insurrection. They thus render it im-
possible for the mastei to treat his slave according
to the dictates of his lieait and his feelings.
Besides, do not the Abolitionists perceive that
the spirit which is thus roused must protract
to an indefinite peuod the emancipation of the
slave ? The necessary effect of their efforts is to
render desperate those to whom the power of
emancipation exclusively belongs I believe most
conscientiously, in whatever light this subject can
be viewed, that the best interests of the slave íe-
quire that the question should be left, where the
Constitution has left it, to the slaveholding States
themselves, without foreign interference.
This being a true statement of the case, as
applied to the States where slav ery exists, wTiat is
now asked by these memorialists  That in this
District of ten miles square—a District carved out
of two slaveholding States, and surrounded by
them on all sides—slavery shall be abolished
What would be the effects of granting their re
quest> You would thus erect acitadel in the very
heart of these States,upon aterntoiy which they
have ceded to you for a far diffeieat puipose,
fiom which Abolitionists and incendiaries could
securely attack the peace and safety of then
citizens. You estabhsh a spot, within the slave-
holding States, which would he a city of refuge
for runaway slaves. You create by lawr a central
point from which trains of gunpowder may be
securely laid, extending into the surrounding
States, which may, at any moment, produce a
fearful and destructive explosion. By passing
such a law, you introduce the enemy into the very
bosom of these two States, and afford him every
opportunity to produce a servile insurrection. Is
theie any reasonable man who can for one mo-
ment suppose that Virginia and Maryland would
have coded the District of Columbia to the United
States, if they had enteitamed the slightest idea
that Congress would ever use it for any such pur
pose > They ceded it for youi use, for your con-
venience,andnotfoi theirowndestruction. When
slavei y ceases to exist under the lawsofVuginia
and Maryland, then, and not till then, ought it to
be abolished in the District of Columhia.
Mr. B. said, that notwithstanding these were
his opinions, he could not vote for the motion of
the Senator from South Carolina, [Mr. Calhoun,]
not to receive these memorials. He would not at
present proceed to state his reasons, still hoping
the Senate could yet agree upon some course
which would prov e satisfactory to all. With this
view, he moved that the whole subject be post-
poned until Monday next.
And after some further debate, it was so post-
poned.
I Mr BENTON rose to express hft concurrence
in the suggestion of the Senator {Volví Pennsyl-
vania, [Mr Buchanan,] that the consideration of
this subject be postponed until Monday It had
come up suddenly, and unexpectedly to day, and
the postponement would give an oppoitunity foi
Senators to reflect, and to confer togethei, and to
conclude v\ hat was best to be done where all were
united in wishing the same end, namely, to allay,
and not to produce excitement He had risen for
this purpose, but, being on his feet, he would say
a few woids on the geneial subject which the pre-
sentation of these petitions had so suddenly and
unexpectedly biought up     With respect to the
Eetitioners, and those with whom they acted, he
ad no doubt but that many of them wen good
people, aiming at benevolent objects, and endeav-
oring to ameliorate the condition of one part of
the human íace without inflicting calamities on
another part, but they were mistaken in their
mode of proceeding, and so fai fiom accomplish
ing any part of their object, the vvhole effect of
their interposition was to aggravate the condition
of those in whose behalf they were interfering
But there was another pait, and he meant to
speak of the Abolitionists generally, as the body
containing the pait of which he spoke—there
was another part whom he could not qualify as
good people seeking benevolent ends by mistaken
means, but as incendiaries and agitators, with
diabolical objects in view, to be accomplished by
wirked and deplorable means He did not go
into the pioofs now to establish the coircctntss
of his opinion of this latter class, but he pre-
sumed it w ould be admitted that every attempt to
work upon the passions of the slaves, and to ex-
cite them to muider their owners, was a wicked
and diabolical attempt, and the work of a mid-
night incendiary Pictures of slave degradation
and misny, and of the white man's luxury and
cruelty, weie attempts of this kind, for they
were appeals to the vengeance of slaves, and not
to the intelligence or reason of those who legis-
lated for them He (Mr B ) had had many pic-
tuics of this kind, as well as many diabolical
publications, sent to him at St Louis, during the
past summer, the whole of which he had cast into
the fire, and should not hav e thought of referring
to the encumstance at this time, as displaying the
character of the incendiary pait of the Abolition-
ists, had he not, within these few days past, and
white abolition petitions were pouring into the
other end of the Capitol, received one of these
pictures, the design of which could be nothing
but mischief of the blackest dye It was a print
from an engraving, [and Mr B exhibited it, and
handed it to Senators near him,] representing a
large and spreading tree of liberty, beneath whose
ample shade a slave owner was at one time lux-
uriously reposing, with slaves fanning him; at
another earned forth in a palanquin, to view the
half-naked laboieis in the cotton-field, whom
drivers, with whips, weie scourging to the task.
The print Was evidently from the abolition mint,
and came to him by some other conveyance than
that of the mail, for there was no post-mark, or
maik of any kind, to identify its origin, and to
indicate its line of march. For what purpose
could sueh a picture be intended, unless to in-
flame the passions of slaves, and why engrave
it, except to multiply copies for extensive distri-
bution ? But it w as not pictures alone that oper-
ated upon the passions of the slaves, but speeches,
publications, petitions presented in Congress, and
the whole machinery of abolition societies None
of these things went to the understandings of the
slaves, but to their passions, all imperfectly undei-
stood, and inspiring vague hopes, and stimulating
aboitive and fata] insurrections Societies, espe-
cially, were the foundation of the greatest mis-
chiefs Whatever might be their objects, the
slav< s ficver did, and nevercan,undeistand them
but in one way—as allies organized for action, and
ready to maich to their aid on the first signal of
insuiicction ' It was thus that the massacre of
San Domingo was made. The Society in Pans,
Les «ímisdcs Nous, Triends of the Bl icks,with its
affiliated societies throughout France and m Lo i-
don, made that massacre And w ho composed
that society' In the beginning it cimpnsed the
extiernes of vutue and of vice, it co named the
best and the basest of hume i kind '—Lafayette,
