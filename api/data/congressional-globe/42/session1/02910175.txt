m
$2,000, andby imprisonmentnotexceeding two years,
cither or both, nt, the discretion of the court in which
the conviction shall take place.
Mr. BCJTLEH, of Massachusetts. I move
that the bill be referred to the Committee on
the Judiciary.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I ask that
the bill he printed.
Mr. FARNSWOSTH. I object.
Mr. GARE 1ELD, of Ohio. Has not the gen-
tleman a right to move that the bill be printed?
The SPEAKER. The printing of bills can
only be ordered by unanimous consent during
the morning hour on Monday.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I hope the gen-
tleman will let the bill be printed. Let us see
what it is.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. It will be printed in
the Globe now.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. Oh, well, let us
have it in printed form also.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I under-
stood the Speaker to put the question on the
reference and printing.
The SPEAKER. The Chair put the ques-
tion in the usual form ; but the gentleman from
Illinois objected to the printing.
Mr. COX. Will it not be printed in the
Globe from this reading?
The SPEAKER. The Globe reporters in-
form the Chair that it will.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. It will
go in the Globe; but let us have it printed for
convenience sake. This is a little exhibition
of spite, that is all.
The SPEAKER. The Clerk will read the
rule, so that there will be no misunderstanding
in regard to it.
The Clerk read as follows:
"On every Monday it is made the duty of the
Speaker to call the States and Territories, first for
bills on leave for reference only, and without de-
bate, and not to be brought back-by motions to
reconsider, at which time joint resolutions of State
and territorial Legislatures may be introduced for
reference and printing.''
The SPEAKER. The rule says that the
introduction of bills shall be for reference
only. A distinction is made between grant-
ing the right to print joint resolutions of Legis-
latures and bills; but, as members are well
aware, it is the usual practice to allow mem-
bers to have bills printed, and the Chair is in
the habit of putting the question by unani-
mous consent. The Chair again asks, "Is there
objection to ordering this bill to be printed?"
Mr. FARNS WORTH. I will withdraw the
objection.
Mr. MORGAN. I object.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. All right.

Joint resolution requesting our Senators and Rep-

legislation protecting emigrants in this country.
Whereas the people of the United States have
invited and will cordially welcome the people of
other lands to come among them and join in the
exercise of all tbo rights and privileges of American
citizenship: and whereas justice, patriotism, and
philanthropy demand the interposition of enlight-
ened public sentiment and law for the protection of
the rights and interests of all those who seek homes
within our borders; and whereas immigration is
eminently a question of national concern, upon the
proper protection, care, and culture of which largely
depend our future progress and prosperity and the
fullest development of our national resources:
Therefore,
Be it refohed, That additional legislation and a
more rigid enforcement of existing laws on the sub-
j eet of immigration are necessary to prevent abuses
and frauds and protect the true interests of the
immigrant while in transit to his destination, and
to this end appropriate legislation is demanded of
the Federal G-overnment.
Resolved, That his Excellency the Governor be
requested to transmit copies of the foregoing pre-
amble and resolution to the Senators and Repre-
sentatives of Pennsylvania in Congress, and that
they be requested to aid in the enactment of suoli
laws as will secure to the immigrant that protection
while in transit which the Government provides for
its own citizens.
