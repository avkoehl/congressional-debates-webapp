length into a luminous history of the several tariff* acts, briefly
touched on the great benefits cunfeired by them on the North
em section of the Union, rendering the agriculturists of the
South hewers of wood and drawers ot water for the r more
skiliul and selfish fellow citizens lie spoke of the indignant
feeutigs which iheactof 1828 had excited in eveiy part of his
State, and said that it wab with some difficulty that the leading
politicians taere had been able to restrain the* people from a
moie violet expie-wi n of then disapprobation Mr H
likene 1 this stau iffeelmg in the ¡south to that pioduced in
.New Lngland bv ihe embaigo act Junng Mr Madisoa's ad
m.rnstratio i, which lie sevetely censuied Hut theie was this
difference buweui the embaigo and tan IT laws The first,
though unwise and uppres.si\e, was within the pale of the Lon
stnution while the latu r were as odious for their uncon-stitu
tionahty as fir their injustice Why did not New England
rebel against t leunoaigo lawi In the first place, the Constim
tion was n >t ve >1 ued bv that aU unwise as it was, and, in the
st.c ndp ace tí eie was inotl ei reason more potent than that,
and that wab New Lngland well knew that she had 'better
enduie the ills that weiebefoie H-t than fly to othets that she
knew not oí" She well knew the value oi the Union to her
and the loss she m ¡m m urif deprived of her profits on the
agricultural laboi of the South
Mr H then spoke of the force bill, which the gentleman
from Ma*?at,husctt& said had been designated as "the blcody
bill,'and said that he nevtr called it the 'bloody bill" He
knew very well, that fiery as were these spu its who, at a meet
ing in Boston, resolved to rally round General Jackcon, as
stated by the gentleman from Massachusetts, they were too in
timatelyacquamted with their own interest*, to carry out their
valiant resolves Thy knew that if they dissolved the Union
by marching on South Caí olma New England might be pre
served as a sick man would be aftet his vitals had been re
moved andtherefoie after all their clash of aims and flouri h
of trumpets they weie vry willing to lay down the swoid
and take up the pen They went into acalculation—of what?
of patnotnm'*' No, sir, it was of the value of the Union in
dollars and cents He would appeal to every man on that floor
whether, in the progress of the whole affair, they saw any thing
like dismay m the bearing of any of the delegation of South
Carolina, as alleged by the gentleman fiom Massachusetts
Though the numbers of the people of the State might be few,
not more than the papulation of the city of New York, as the
gentleman snecringly remarked, they wet", firm in their pur
po¡>e, confident in the justice of their cause, and with
a full reliance on Divine Providence, they were ready to abide
the result Did the gentleman doubt that if two hundred and
iifty or two hundred and sixty thousand of such a population
ha I gone into the baf tie, they would have accomplished a revo
lution not very advantageous to the interests of the people he
represents? Was not the moial effect produced by their bold
and virtuous daring, standing out in bold relief before the gen
tleman's ejes? He denied emphatically that the delegation,
fiom South Carolina had evinced any suth symptoms of weak
ness as the gentieman intimated The gentleman intimated
that the mem beis fiom South Cirulma, alarmed at the predica
merit m which they had placed themselves, alter vaunting what
they would do weie for dodging the question
Mr AD \M& interrupted Mi II and denied that he used any
sue i language
Mr HOL\í¡ Seaid that if the gentleman did not use that Ian
guage in his Saturday's &peech, he used it on a foi met occasion
But be would ask the gentleman diatmctiv, did he noi say thit
the merrbers from Sjmh Garohiii went about this floor with de
jected countenances, begging membei s to compromise?
Mr fi DAM  Ye¡>, sir I said so in substance, and I íe
peat it
Mr HOLMES The gentleman, then, repeats it He would,
therefore, ask if there weie any members now present who
were here on that occasion, whether they saw any thing like
dismay in M McDuifie, or if he was one of those who went
about besging for a compromise
(Mr Adam:     ISo,sit, Mr McDuifi  wasnotoneof them ]
Did Mr Barnewell, with his high sense of honor and
chivalrous feeling, forgetful of his Revolutionaiy anees
tiy, show any thing like dismayt r>0, sir, I know he did
not Can it be believed that the other gallant and high
mmded gentlemen from my State would have acted in the
unbecoming mannei that the gentleman intimites? No, sir, I
ventuieto say that the gentleman will except them Weil, then,
who were the gentlemen who went about with dismay, begging a
compromise He doubted not they were grave and thoughtful, for
knowing how neai they s ood to the hearts oí their constituents,
and the high íespunsibility devolving on them, they coul I not
out look on the tremend hi* conflict that w as appi oailung with
the most giave and serious reflections But they were calm,
united and determined in their purpose 1 ln-y knew that the
Northern horde with which General JaoUon threatened to
sweep down on thesunny South, and cany ruin and destruction
to the homes of then wives and little ones, was alien to them m
sympathies and feeling , bat they weie confident in then own
strength and calmly abi^e 1 ¡heresult Would the gentleman
from Massachusetts say that there was no danger of bloodshed,
and that the apprehensions of the other is ates had no ¿hare m
bringing about this com promise1 Would the gentleman say that
it wa& humanity only, and to save the distinguís ed citizen of
Siuth Carolina m the othei House from bene executed by
General Jack o i under the second section, which effecte 1 the
passage of this rompiomise Why, the gentleman himself
showed that the bill was buined through this House, m viola
tion of its rule , and by the sciewot the pievious question
Was not that some evidence that apprehensions weie entertain
el m oil er í aits of the House! He was veiy ready to admit
that the gentleman him^lf was opposed to the bill He had
no doubt but the venerable gentleman w ukl have been the
willing; standard fen ei of General Jackson in marching on
South Carolina [Mr Adams here made a gesture of dissent ]
Htcouldnotdoubtbutthegentleman, from the indications he
ha^iepeatedlyipen of rancorous hostility to the South, would
have been the willing standard bearer on such an occasion
Had he not evinced this hostility on every suitable oceasio ?
Did he not promulgate the doctrine to the fanatics of the North,
that in the event of a war, foieign or domestic, there would
be a way thiough the treaty making power by which the
South could be deprived of us property? Did he not know that
theseedshe had sown would take root in the minds of the
Northern fanatics and that although he says that he is not an
Abolitionist, he is looked upon as their captain? Mr H con
eluded by briefly recapitulating his objections to the bill He
believed it to be unwise and impolitic beciuse it levied reve
nue that was unn ccsiry for the wants of the Government—
unwi->e, because it unsettled exchange*, and would injurious af
fe^t the commeicial transacuonsof the country Ard he was
also opposed to it hecau e it wou d íouse up fmther effnts
from the people of the high tariff section of the country agun
to fasten on it that odious system
Mr SERGCANTspdcewitb great earnestness and power in
favor of the passage of the bill examining it especially with
refeience to its bearing upon the compromise act ard contend
ing that its provision5", whilst thev amounted to a repeal of the
act of July, 1S32 did not affect or mtetfeie with the provisions
of the compromise act
Mr GILMER next took the floor, and spoke at some length
m favor of the motion to strike out the enacting clause of the
bill In refeiring to the compiomi^e act, hesaid that the true
characteristics of that act which recommended it strongly to
him, were that it contemplated that duties weie to be levied for
revenue only, and in the next place to the amount only neces
sary to the supply of the economical wants of the Government
He begged leave to call the attention of the committee to the
principle recognised in the language of the compromise—a
principle which ought to be recogiued in all time to come by
every departmentoftheGovernment It is said he, that duties to
be raised for r-p venue are to be raise 1 to such an amount only as
isnecessaiy for an economical administration of the Govern
ment Some incidental protection must necessarily be given,
and he, foi one, coming fiom an anti tariff portion of thecoun
tiy, would notobjectton But, said he we were told yesterday
by the gentleman from Massachusetts, [.Mr Adams,] that he
did not consider the compromise binding, becaus it was a
compact between the "outh and the West in which New Eng
land was not a party, and it was crammed down her throat by
the previous questi >n, he voting against it The gentleman
from Pennsylvania said to day almost the same thine, for he
consideied if meiely a point of honor wh ch he was willing to
concede to the South and that object gamed, there was no longer
reason foi adhenng to if
Did the gentleman contend thatno law was binding on New
England, and on him, unless it is sanctioned by him and the
New England delegation? Sir, said Mr G I believe that it is
binding whether sanctioned by New England oi not The gen
tleman said that hp would give the public lands to the States,
and the compromise act to the dogs Sir, if the lands are to
be given to the States if upwards of three millions are to be
deducted from that sourc of revenue, and we are then to be
told that this furnishes a pretext, first for borrowing and then
for taxing the people, we may well feel cause for insisting on
the ob'jgations of the compromise Sir, sail Mr G gentlemen
know very well that there is some virtue in the compromise
act, and that though it may be repudiated bv a few of the íe
presentatives of the people, yetthe people themselves will all
here to it as the means of averting the greatest of evils Rut he
had seen enough to show him that the power of giving micht
be consti ued as the powei of taking and he should not be sui
prised to seea prapt sition to assumethe debts of the Slate1:—
for the mote fhat you eive the more that is wanted
After some futther remarks, Mr G «aid that he was opposed
to the hurrying of this important measure thrr ugh attlk- pre
sent session Let us wait until sufficient information is obtained
to enable us to actjudiciously Let us wait to inquire whethei
there is any necessity for raising an increased revenue of eight
millions of dollars from aitides all of which under the com
piomise art, are either free of duty or liable to a duly of less
than 20 percent Let us not be told that <n account of the ap
propnations fora home squadron and forfoitificationsamount
ing to about thtee millions of dollar4! that it is necessary to raise
thiblaigesum We have already borrowed twelve millions of
dollars, and dunrg the remainder of the year, Mr Tawing tells
us that the customs will yield five millions, which together
will make seventeen millions of dollars of available means m
the Treasury Then there was a large sum in the hands of the
disbursing ^ffkeis of the Government and he ventured to assert
that there would be more than twenty nulhoi s at the disposal of
the Tieasui y before the expiration of the next session of Con
gre<=s Are we to be told, said Mi G that we aie to increase
t^e tariff in order to give to the States this fourth instalment
under the deposite acta No, sir let us arrest this course of ex
tiavagance at the outlet, let us arrest that bill which is now
hanging m the othei House, [me Distribution bnl,j and which
I trust will ever hang there I et us airest that bill and the
proceeds from that source will, in the coming four yeat^, pay
this twelve millnn 1 an But these measmesare all apart of
the same =>sem Distribution is used as a pre est for
a loan, and a loan is used as a pretext for high du
ties This was an extraordinary ses ion of Coneie^s,
and Inasmuch as there would be within a few months a regular
sewnn—inasmuch as the Committee on Commerce had te
ported a resolution contemplating the or aiization of a <*eiect
committee, with a view to the collection of information tu did hi
the revision of the tariff for revem e and ma much -w tbp
compromise eoes fully u to operation in July next-he tho isht
that wisdom as well tsjustice deman led that they should not
hurrythrough so important a measme when it was not ab
soluiely essential to the wants of the Government
Aftei same further remarks, Mr G said that it wastimetbat
be and his Whig ft lends should unler'Ufld one another He
wantel now to undeiatand what were the car hnal principles of
the Wrig party of which he was an humble member He had
foi six or seven yeaisbeen a member of that party, and thouaht
he understood he r principles, but be much feared that he had
been acting under some delusion, and now that they were all
here together, he wished to come to a perfect understanding'
Sir, said Mr G we have heard very often h«re that the peopt 
of the United States have decided upon the great question 
which now agitate the country, and that all we have to do isr to
register their edicts He denied this m toto He would tell
ge ltlemen what the people did decide They decided that thero
had been a wasteful administration of the people's money;
and that theie should be economy, not niggardly, but liberal
economy in the public expenditures They decided that there
should be a responsibility of public officers to the laws and to
the Consti tu ti m 1 hey decided that theie should lea reduc-
tion of the power and pationageof the Expcutive bianehofihe
Government, and a testiiction of all theDepartmentsof the Go-
vernment to the objects for which they weie constituted They
decided that there should be no proscription for opinion's sake;
and, sn, if there was one principle more strongly avowed thaa
^nothei dining the last Piesidenual contest, which echoed from
one side of the continent to the other, it was that there should
be no prosci iption for opinion's sake And yet, said Mr G.
when we are assembled in giand council for the first time, what
do we heat? Why sir we are to be proscribed for opinion's
sake for the sake of opinions which we always honestly, it may
be ignotantly, enteitained I hope, said Mr G that we shall
not exhibit the singular ¡spectacle of the Whig party proscrib-
ing a Whig President for opinion's sake It would indeed pre-
sent a ludicrous spectacle to the people of the United ¡?tales.
The President of the United States has kept the faith he always
professed, and if now you are disposed to quarrel with him be-
cause he, with those who think with him, has certain abstrac-
tions, and would not, after he got into power, tura Tuik or Ma*
hommedan, the sin wilt be yours
Let us, said Mr G say a word about abstractions They
are certain great principles which regulate the conduct of men,
morally and politically Mr G hereTgave a view of his politi-
cal faith, and contrasted n with that of those who are in favor
of a strong Government, and who would accomplish the objects
they have m view by construction, if they cando it by no other
means But these opinions, said Mr G may be regarded as
abstractions He feared that the Constitution itself might 13e
legaided as an abstraction 1 he ten commandments—the New
Testament, on which the hopes of man here and hereafter are
founded, areaset of abstraction'' The old adage, that hcriesty
is the best policy, is regarded by the highwayman asamiserable
abstraction Ihere weie many sorts of abstractions There
was one abstraction which guards the people's money m their
Tieasury and another abstraction which wouldabstiact it from
them without their consent He was for the one and not for
the othci He was amused yesterday to hear the gentleman
from New Jersey, |Mr Halsted,] in speaking of the Adminis-
tration of the venerable gentleman from Massachusetts, say that
if that Administration had been suffered to go on, we «hould
have seen lessof thi-, le^softhat, and less of the other, thai) we
have seen The gentleman termed the party who supported
that Administration as the Whig party Now he, Mr. G was
always of opinion that the Whig party took i*s date from tha
year 1833 If it dated from 1829, the gentleman should remem-
ber that
"In Adam's fall,
We sinned all "
If, indeed, the Whig party was of so early a date, the gen-
tleman fiom Massachusetts was entitled to take the lead mtt*
He is entitled to lead here and wherever it is avowed thattha
parly of 1823 was the Whig party But let the gentleman íe*
member that the excesses of the two last Presidents had in--
duced many of then friends to secede from them, and that tho
secedeis fiom the Jackson and Van Buren ranks form the ma>
jonty of the Whig party We formed a union, said Mr G wjth
the opposition party of that day, and though we differed with
th*>m about abstractions as we do now, he asked gentlemen if our
differences of opinion were thrown up to us when they wer*
beating up for recruits? If the admmistiationof the venerabla
gentleman from Massachusetts was the commenct ment of the
Whig party, how was it at the time of General Jackson's pro-
clamation? Who were the Whigs then? He heard that
the veneiable g^ntlemai was ready to buckle on his armor m
support of the proclamation What dtd gentlemen want1
Did they want to fo"m a new party If so he was con-
tent, but they must not ask him to join them He wanted
the people of this country to know who it was who
wmted to foim a new paity Are the doctrines of 1829
and those of the gentleman from Massachusetts to pre-
vdif1 Wdlyou,'aid he, take the principles avowed here by
him that by virtue of the treaty making power every slave on
this continent may beset free? It appeared that no man was
now consideied as sound in his political faith who would not
vote tor a Bank of the United States for a distribution bill when
the Tieasury was empty ora bankrupt law when the Govern-
ment itself miahtbethe first to take the benefit of it Mr G said
that a new patty had been formed, and he was content Ha
would form no new party, but would rest himself on these ab-
stiactions He should endeavor for one to carry outtbeprm-
cipleswhichhadbeenprofessedby the Whig party during the
late Piesidential contest These were, practical, enduring re-
fm m and when he was told that because he would not change
his opinions he would die of abstractions he would aaswer that
he would settle that matter with his constituents He Wis at a
loss to perceive how the people had approved in the election of
Harrison and Tvler what they condemned in the defeat of tba
gentleman from Massachusetts
