General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Headquarters, near Chattanooga, Tenn.:

General S. Jones reports to-day from Zollicoffer that Burnside is believed to have gone with the greater part of his force toward Knoxville; that three brigades, about 4,000 men, from Vicksburg passed Cumberland Ford en route to Burnside between Watauga and Jonesborough. General Jones is without information of your movements except that sent from here. Communicate with him, sot hat he may co-operate with you.
