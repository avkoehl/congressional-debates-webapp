APPENDIX TO  THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

25th Cong««*-£nd Sess.
Northeastern Boundary—Mr. Evans.
H. of Reps.
passed for the admission of the Stales of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois)
and Missouri, into the Union, on an equal footing with the ongi
nal States" The act^ of March, 1825, authorized the survey
and laying out the road to the permanent seat of Government of
the Stateof Missouri
It is impossible for the unbiassed mind to read the foregoing
acts of Congress without clearly perceiving that the extent of
obligation imposed by them requires the faithful appropriation
and expenditure of ¿he two percent fund in making roads lead
wig to the ¡states mentioned, and nothing more Now; if it can
be shown that we have done that, the obligation is discharged
If we have expended more, the excess is a gratuity
The gentleman from Virginia [Mi Dromgoole] has caused a
thorough examination of all acts heretofore passed, appropn
atmg money tn make the loal The result i", that $6,365,-
083 46 have already expended, of that sum $2,843,942 20 have
been expended between Cumberland and the Ohio river, and
63 521,141 96 have been expended between the Ohio and Mis
siasippi rivers How much doesthe two per cent fund amount
to, and which Congress was under obligation to appropriate in
road making fur the benefit of these States? I called for in for
mation during the last Congress, to ascertain the amounts actu-
ally paid to these States—to wit the three pei cent of the five
percent fund. By the report of the Register of the Treasury,
dated the 29th day of December, 1836, it appeals the State of
Ohio was entitled to, and liad received.              $464,368 51
Indiana           do           do          do                         388,102 61
Illinois            do           do          do                         260328 96
Missouri        do           do          do                         146,929 20
Constituting an aggregate of            ${1,259,727 28
The%vo percent retained by Government is just two thirds
of this aggregate, or $839,818 18, which, being deducted irom
46 365,083 46, shows that we have, as a gratuity, expended
¿5,525,265 28 moie than we were bound to do To all this
should be added the 'hree per cent on the sales of public lands,
Slid to the above four States, which, prior to the 29th day of
ecember, 1836, amounted, as above shown, to #1,259,727 28,
an 1 the millions of acres given them for education and other
purposes, if we would bring togethei in a single view the many
favors % nich a bountiful Government hasshoweied upon them
Ido notrepmeat the munificence of the General Government
to the new States I do not envy their prosperity I rejoice
at it The r citizens are my countrymen, and they give a kind
welcome to such as leave the old States in puisuit of bettei for
Cues in newer homes Sir, I have many relations connections,
and friends in the States most benefited by the extension of the
Cumbenand road But I am rot so Wind is not to peiceive that
Government has more than discharge 1 all it* obligations to
them and their States, and that, if you could double the quan-
tity of lands yet to be sold m their boundaries, and treble the
price, two per cent on the money aiismg would never reim
binse us the half of the expetidituie already made, over at d
 bove what any compact lequired us to expend Under these
circumstances, the people of those States have no just claim to
ask from an empty Treasury the additional sum oí S359 000 tu
go on with the work My motion to lecommrt, with instruc
tions, is made m older that the road shall be surrendered to
them, and, if hereafter the two per cent fund should ever aug
ment so as to overpay us, which is scarcely a po^sibleevent, no
one will more cheerfully surrender the surplus than I Indeed,
sir, it may now be provided for, if my motion provide     In
tivingup the road so far as it may have been finished, the
utes should come under the same terms and stipulations in
regard to the passage of the mail, troops, munitions of war, «Sec
as have been heretofore made in relation to that part of the
roadalready finished and ceded to the States In legaid to the
parts of the road partially done, I am willing to ask no equiva
lent in return
I have shown, sir, that we violate no compact in refusing
to make the appropriation now asked I have shown it by
the record, and when the íecord (your statutes) is examined,
it will be seen that this Cumberland toad and its extension
never constituted a part of any general plan or system of inter-
nal improvement, but that it had us origin in compacts with
t*ie States to and thcougn which it goes, and the enhancement
of the value of the public domain So far as it depends upon
these peculiar grounds, the argument in support of it doei not
m the least maintain the power of this Government to adopt
and execute a genera! system of internal improvement On
the contrary, by placing this load foi support upon the com
pacts and the proprietary interest of the Government, th* argu
pient m favor of a general system is thereby weakened It is
as much as to say, but for these peculiar considerations the
road could not have been constitutionally made by us
One of the gentlemen from Indiana [Mr Ewinc]Gives mea
eautionupon the subject of breaking down " obligations en
teretl into bv solemn compacts," while I " attfl hold the new
States bound by their st pulations in relation to thesoveieignty
ofchesoii." The gentleman is wholly mistaken if he sup
posesl wish to avoid any obligation which the Government
has incurred I am for iulfilUng all obligations, not only lite
rally, but Ubeially, and in this instance we have done it by
giving heaping measure I can only understand the gentle
man's remark m relation to "the sovereignty of the soil" as
a threat that if Congress refuse to spend millions more to com
plete the road, if Congiess evince a deteimination now to stop,
the ''■new States" might justifiably seize upon the public do-
main withm their borders, and appropriate it exclusively to
their own use In a private or public capacity I trust I shall
never fail to perform my dutv m consequence of threats of any
kind. I w 11 not be alaimed on the present occasion I will
only retort upon my venerable friend from Indiana, (foi such
1 esteem him,) by using his own language, and tell him,
" that he greatly overrates his sagacity and intellectual
strength, if he thinks he can break down the obhg-itions
entered into, and acted upon for thirty years,' ond excite
rebellion in the State which has honoied him, even if mv
motion should prevail I must tell my friend another thine I
am, in principle, opposed to paying people for keeping quiet
I will give Indiana no bribe to keep her hands off the public
lands I know individuals sometimes make exactions and the
timid sometimes yield in the hope of keeping upon good terms,
but I have never known an unjust person to commence this
game, who did not increase hw exactions until they became in-
tolerable, and at last* the party imposed on would be driven to
resistance Sir, the manly and best policy always i«, to attack
imposition at the threshold Friendships which can he pur
«based and paid for by gold are not worth having That ]jga-
soent binds robbers together The friendship which is worthy
9i el&yated unjUyidu*! , worthy of great communities, jg based
upon sympathy, benevolence, and the principles of eternal jus-
tice It prompts the parties to entertain mutual respect, to give
each his share of any common blessing, to rejoice in their mu*
tual piospenty, and to aid each other m every good work It is
this generous and noble friendship which I desire to see Ken
tucky cherish foi and towards all her sister States On their
part I wish to see it reciprocated I wish to put down, to ex-
terminate evei y sordid, sectional, partial, and unjus feeling and
motive of action To do this, so far as it is to be effected by a
system of internal improvement, you must make it general oi
you must give it up entirely The peace and hirmony of farm
lies are destroyed, if the father lavishes all his bounty on a favo-
uteson and suffers the rest to go neglected m ignorance and
rags So with these States, unless j ustice and equality, accord
mg to the rule of taxation, or the rule of federal numbers, aie
observed, a burning indignation takes possession of the breasts
of the neglected, and wh< n the Governmeat tumbles to pieces
from its own lottenness they will clan their hands for ]oy
Mr Speaker, several of my Whig friends who drfier with me
on the present occasion, hare ventured, in the course of their
íemarks, to express their regiet that the proposition I have
submitted should come from a Whig What, sir, regiet that
a Whig should propose to stay the hand of extravagance, to
stop expenditures partial and unjust, to claim common funds
as common property, and to insist that they shall be used for
the benefit of all, and not foi a few' Sir, 1 ought to have re
ceived the thanks of every true hearted Whig, rather than the
cold expressions which have been bestowed There is some
thins wonderful m the amalgamating influences of this Cum
berlandroad It operates like magic The Whigs ol Ohio, In
diana, and Illinois walk as lovingly with their political adver
sane  on this particular question as if they had always, on all
questions, been perfectly agreed' How happens it that even
where this road touches the temtory of the Old Dominion, it
makes the representative a good internal improvement man,
and seems to silence all constitutional scruples m voting mo
ney for that purposed I dare not say, when our constituents
aie getting monej, and we, m consequence, aie gett n? then
votes, that all <?o situated have inesistible motives to support
appropriations to continue this road But I will say, there is
a wondeifui unanimity of sentiment on this particular matter
among the representatives of the States through which the
road is tobe carried northwest of the Ohio river' Sir I will
take leave of my Whig friends m these States, and of the sub
ject by «saying to them, go home, tell your constituents that
they have had millions more than they weie entitled to under
any compact, that Congress has given them the road as it is,
and asked nothit g m return where it is not already finished,
and that they like a fa%ored *on of a kind father, who finds it
necessary and just towithhoid further dor?tions, ought to re
turn blessings lor past favors, irstcad of curses for the ch tnge
in the fathei 'a conduct You may tell them all this with truth,
if my motion prevails, and they will approve what Congresb
has done, foi vouiepresent a stir-ublt, reflecting, and honest
people
THE NORTHEASTERN BOUNDARY.
SPEECH OF MR. EVANS,
Of Maine,
In the House of Repi espnlatives, May 29, 1838—The House
having proceeded to the Orders of the Day, and taken up
the message received from the President a few days ago, on
the subject of the Northeastern Boundary of the United
States—
Mr EVANS said The topics involved in the message re
specting the Northeastern Boundary of the United States were of
too great and pressing ímpoitAnce, as> well to the State here
presented as to the peacefulrelationsof the country,to be pass-
ed over without some observations He wisTied he could im
press upon the House, and upon Congress and, if hit. voice
could reach beyond these walls, upon the othei Department of
the Government also, the necessity, absolute necessity, of
prompt, efficient movement, on its pait, lor the adjustment, on
just, &afc, and honorable principles, of this motracted contro
veisy Tarther delay could only result in deeper embariass
ment The legislation «f the State whose rights and interests
were more directly atstake had precluded much longer delay
The evidence of this; is now before us fl> a resolution, adopted
with entire unanimity at the late session of its Legisliture,
winch I shall presently have occasion to read, (.said Mr E) it
is made the duty of the Govcrnoi of Maine, m certain contm
gencies, to cause the line of boundary on the Northeastern fron
tier to be surveyed and established, agieeab'y to the treaty of
1783 Those contingencies are, ihatthebilhntroduced by my
self some months ago, and «since reported by the Committee on
Foreign Affairs shall notbecome a law, orthat the Government
of the United States, either by itself, or in conjunction witn
Great Britain oi with Maine, shall not appomt a commission to
do the same thing and the period assigned by the resolve for
the performance of this duty bv the Go^ ernor, should the Urn
ted States fail to undertake it in one of th^se modes is the first
day of September next That period is approaching, ard th3
duty devolved upon the Go\ernor will unquestionabh be dis
charged Let this not be doubted It will bt done That it
will be attended with hazaid to the pacific i elations between
us and Gieat Britain, there ¡s too much reason to fear Th°se
considerations, I trust, will at cm e to this subject the earnest at
ten'ion of both blanches of Concresfi, and m tlie comee of the
rt-mirksl am about tosubm t, I will erdeavor to point out the
mode m which justice may begone to the State, and, <t the
same time, the peace of the natum pre«en ed
The message which is now the matter for consider mon em
braces two objects, the first of which is of compaiatively little
importance It relatts merely to certain c'aims of theStaeof
Md.me for reimbursement forexpenditures ircuired m'afl irdmg
protection to citizens of the United States, who had been har^s
ed, arrested, and imprisoned by the Go\ eminent of New Brnns
wick, under its pretended claim of jurisdiction and authori y
over what they denominate the disputed temtory The amount
is not large, but is justly due to the State, and ihehope was
indulged that the Piesidentwou'd himself have ordered its psy
mint, without recourse to Congress Doubting his author ty
however, to do so, he has trrnsmitted it here; notwithstanding
on a former occasion, in 1828, the then Secietary ot State (Mr
Clay) caused expenses of precisely a similar clmrae er to be
reimbursed, at the request of the Governor of the State, without
submitting u to Congríes at all    This precedent howler,
does not seem to meet with fayor auhis time, and the subject
is presented to us I shall move, eir, to refer this part part of the
message to the Com matee on Foreign Affairs. If they see fit to
report favorably upon the claim, it will be no more than jus*
tice, otherwise, if the injustice will be so light and lusignafioant,
m comparison with the gieater injus ice we have suffered, thai,
for myself, I shall hardiy bestew a thought upon it With
these remaiks, which are all I shall ofler upen that part of the *
message, I submit it to the will and pleasure pf the committee
solely
The remainder of the message, and the documents which ac-
company it, are of much more giave- and serious import, it
invites no action on the pait of Congress It contains nothing
upon which eithei House can act It is not necessary* there-
fore, that it should undergo the examination of any committee.
It is communicated only "to shew the actual state of the nego-
tiations with Gt eat Britain on the general question " However
unusual it maybe for the Piesident to communicate to Con-
gres , and especially to this House, the state or the circum-
stances of a pending negotiation, I rejoice that he has done so m
this instance But I do not rejoice m the information we. save
received of the character and purposes ofthe proposed renew-
ed negotiations I fear, indeed, it may have a disastrous ef
feet upon the measure we are pressing by all means m our
power for running the line agieeably to the bill 1 have refer-
red to
"The actual state of the negotiations on the general ques-
tion " we learn from the documents submitted with the mes-
sage, to be, that, on the 27th of April last, Mr Forsyth, the Se-
cie'arv of Sate, apprized Mr Fox the British Minister, that he
was directed by the President to announce to him
"The willingness of this Government to enter into an ar-
rangement with Gieat Britain for the establishment of a joint
commission of survey and exploraron, upon the basis of the
original Ameucan proposition, and the modifications offered by
her Majesty's Go; ei nment'
Thf secretary of ¡state unites the Mimstei to a conference,
with a view * to conclude a contention embracing that object"
It will be seen that very 1 n tie mfoi ¡nation is to be gathered from
thifa lettei alone of the chaiacterol the proposed negotiation.
Whatthp "o jcnnal Ameucan proposition" was, and wnat were
the "modification* offered by her Majesty 'a Government," are not
stated, and perhaps need not have been The reply of the
Britjt-h Minister of the 1st of May sa> e that he ia "not at present
provided withfuil powor^for nego'iatmg the proposed conven
tioa," but will transmit the proposal to hei Majesty's Govern-
ment and must weiitfor fiesh instruct ons The "modifica
tions" h speaks of is contained in his note of the 10th of Janua
ry last From this we learn that a propo mon formerly made
by the American to the British Government, and subsequently
modified by the 1 itter has again been renewed, and that a con-
vention between the two Governments mav íeasonably be anti-
cipated upon the basis of that proposition, and the modifica-
tions of it In a Icttci fiom Mr Fursvth to the Governor of
Mame, dated Ma} P he wf i -> the latter that this has been
done "in accordance with the expressed wishes of the Legisla-
ture ' of ihat Suit. a& lie bid prevnusij uifoimed Mr Fox, on
the. 7th of Pebrnaiy last, that it would «oí be invited ''unless
the author'ties ot the State of Mane" ' should deem it more
likely to lead toa imal adjustment of the question of boundary
than the General G<n enirrent deems it to he ' It «eems, there-
fore, that the Secretary of State, by direction of the President,
has proffered this negotiation upon the ground that it is m con-
foimity with ' the expressed wishes  of the Lesislature of
Maine, who deem u likely to lead to a final adjustment ofthe
question Now, sir, if this be so, certainly neither the State
itself, nor its representatives here, can have any just groand of
objection to the proceedings about to be instituted But I take
occasion here to say, what I wi*I more fully show before I sit
down, that upon this mat.er the Secretary labors under some
extraordinary mistake The Legislature ofthe State have never
expressed any loishes, oi consent, to such a negotiation as is pro-
posed, nor have any ofthe constituted authorities of the State;
nor have they d ne or *aid any thing which can he so constru
ed    But of this more hereafter
My purpose m w is to deal with this [ original American
proposition, ; which has been thus renewed, and to ghow that
it was, at the time, m connection with certain concessions and
principles coupled with it and mide pan of it, and to he ob
ser\ed m the execution of it, highly objectionable and dan-
gerous and that the Bntrh modifications lender it atill more
so, and if earned out fullv, m the sense intended by Great
Bruain, it Mil be a sui render of the whole question at issue.
"What, then was 'the original American proposition1'* It was
first suggested but not distinctly offered, by Mr Livingston, m
his let er to the British Minister of the 30ih of April, 1833, in
these words
"All the disadvantages of these modes of settlement, hereto-
fine adopted, might, at> it appears to the American Govern
ment, be a^ oided by appointing a new commission, consisting
of an equal numbei of commissioners, with an umpire selected
by some fnendlv sovereign from among the most skilful men
m Europe, to decide on all points m winch they disagree, or,
by acorn minion enmefy composed of fauch nitn, m> selected*
to be attended, m the survey ard view of the countrj, by agents
appointed by the parties
This was a meie ^ueges ioi, not much pressed, for the ap.
pomtmem, m one or the other modes indicated, of a commis-
sion, withanumpne, who should have power '■Ho decide on
all points" of dmgieerrent If this had been all, probably it
would not have been very objectionable, although even m us
best aspect, it might not have been entirely satisfactory to
Maine But it was nt t all The Secretary proceeded to offer,
a" <m inducement to the British Gs \emrrent to adopt the sug
ge&tion, a proposition for the employment of a new principle
i7i sun eying," which wis sub-^equently pressed with much
earnestness (or &cveiai >eais, and that was a departure from
the true north course from tie monument «ailed foibythe
tí eat/, and a dev ation westwa.7 d, m seai ch of highlands, pro.
\ided none satisfactory cuuld be fo trd in the fhM named me-
ndian In the «une Icftu, Mr Livingston, dfterexplaining his
meaning, says
'As this principie dre<  not seem, hitherto, t# have been
adopted itappears'o the Government ef the United States to
offlrtothecomirissioneis who may be appointed the means of
an amicable adjustment
It isthu5* plain that, in the very inception of the proposition
it was carried out upon this new principle, and that "the eom!
missioners who may be appointed" were to avail themselves
oí this mode of "a  amioftbleacyustmeai,"
