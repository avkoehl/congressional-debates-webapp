Major General C. C. AUGUR:

What news have you from your scouting parties in Loudoun County? I am exceedingly anxious to learn. I have heard nothing from Snicker's Gap for two days. Answer.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Commanding Middle Military Division, Harper's Ferry:

I have no news from the Eighth Illinois Cavalry, or from Gansevoort. A refugee just in from Culpeper, which place he left on Friday last, reports no forces of the enemy there, except a conscripting party and small parties of ten or fifteen passing through daily. Fitzhugh Lee, with his cavalry, about 3,000, and part of Longstreet's corps, about 10,000, left there to join Early last Friday a week. He thinks they went through Sperryville and Thornton's Gap. Mosby, with two pieces of artillery, attacked the small cavalry force at Annandale this morning. I have not yet heard of the result. The force there is in a stockade.

General C. C. AUGUR,

Washington, D. C.:

Scouts just in from Snicker's Gap report no crossing there. A party of cavalry, 300 or 400 strong, was seen about Hillsborough; could not tell whether they were rebels or our people. Have you any one out in that direction?

Major-General.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Commanding Middle Division, Harper's Ferry:

I have nothing from scouting parties later than I sent you this morning. Mosby is said to have been in command of the force that attacked Annandale this morning. He demanded a surrender, which was refused. He opened upon the stockade with two pieces of artillery. He was driven off, Major Horton, Sixteenth New York Cavalry, in command, following him up. I have sent all available cavalry force to join in pursuit. I will inform you the moment I learn anything worth knowing.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
