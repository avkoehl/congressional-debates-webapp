have arrangements made to receive and store these supplies. I hope you will be able to employ negro teamster enough for the trains, at all events enough to take care of them as they arrive. The teams are being sent by General Allen, I suppose, from Louisville, so that I may not know in time what he has sent with them. I will keep you notified, as far as possible, by telegraph and by letter.
