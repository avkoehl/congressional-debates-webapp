HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,Cold Harbor, Va., June 12, 1864-12 noon. (Received 5 a.m., 13th.)

General Owen is under arrest for misconduct in face of the enemy and ordered to Fort Monroe, where court will sit to try him. Same court will try General Ward. General Eustis is relieved of his command and ordered to Washington. He is to be informed that if he does not resign, charges of neglect of duty and general inefficiency will be preferred against him. He is said to eat opium. General Grant desires me to say that he wishes General Slocum should remain in command at Vicksburg. General Grant has information, on which he relies, that General Slocum is making war on a den of thieves who have their seat there, and wishes that he should be left to straighten them out. Among these people is Fields, the commissioner of abandoned plantations. A son of Adjutant-General is said to be a partner with Fields in some knavish speculations.
