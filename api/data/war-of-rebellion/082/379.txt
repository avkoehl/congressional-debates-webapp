General WEITZEL:

The river at this point measures 580 feet. I will require twenty-four pontoons with those that I have here. I think I better have two or three extra ones. I also want some spikes and nails. The approaches on both shores are very good. What time may I expect the pontoons here?

T. LUBEY,

Captain and Engineer Officer.

Jones' Neck:

General Benham was here this morning, and rather objects to giving us any more boats. He says he wants them. But prepare the approaches and abutments and we will see what we can do with our canvas pontoon train. I will send you the nails.
