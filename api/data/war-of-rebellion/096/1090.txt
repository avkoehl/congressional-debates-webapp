QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL:

For attention as to the call for clothing, &amp;c.

I have, in addition, an unofficial letter from General York stating that his operations in recruiting are much retarded by inability to obtain supplies of clothing, &c. With them he thinks he could speedily fill his brigade with reliable material.

Respectfully returned to the Secretary of War:

Major Pierce, at Raleigh, and Captain Crafts, at Charleston, were both instructed to issue supplies to such men as General York might recruit. There has been no time since the order was given when their weekly reports did not show supplies enough for more men than have been enlisted.
