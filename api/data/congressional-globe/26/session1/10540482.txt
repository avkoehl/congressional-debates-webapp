APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Bankrupt Bill—Mr. Hubbard.
May, 1840.
Senate.
as my colleague alleges, they would long snce
hare been detected aad exposed.   The discovery
not baring been made, the conclusion is legitimate
that they are either imaginary, oi else my colleague
has suffered himself to be deluded and deceived by
common rumor.   Upon such grounds no charge
should eret be sustained, for we all know that com-
mon rumor is a common liar.   Let the facts be ex-
hibited—let the alleged frauds be proved; and I, as
well as those with whom I act, will go willingly
with him, not only to expose them, but to visit
upon their authors the severest punishment for io
high an offence.
I return to my figures.   In 1838, the expendi-
eres for the naval-establishment were
$6,131,580 53
In 1826, for the same object, they
were      ....   4,257,476 43
Making an excess  in   1838 over
1636 of -           -           -           -$1,874,104 10
When, by reference to the history oí this branch
of the public service, it is seen that there were
more ships in commission in the latter year than in
the former, and when my colleague himself now
not only calls for an increase of that force, but is
loud ia his complaints because it has not been pro-
vided; when we know that the number of officers
and men has been necessarily greatly enlarged, and
their pay, by tne act of 1835, also increased when in
acuve service, surely there can be no pretence
whatever on his part tor the charge of extravagance,
because, order such c rcumstances, the navy cost
more in 1838 than it did in 1826. The nary, with
all parties, is the favorite arm of our national de-
fence; and rery few, if any, of the opponents of
the Administration, voted against these increased
appropria'ions. They knew an accession to the
naval foice in commission (o be necessary for the
protection of our commerce. They cannot, the:e-
ibre, in justice or consis ency, condemn as extrava-
gance what they themselves approved, because con-
sidered indispensable.
Nor can the trust funds paid out by the Govern-
ment in 1838, be charged among the expenditures
of ihM year. These funds, I need scarcely re-
mark, torm no part whatever of the public expen-
ditures. The term explains itself too clearly to re-
quire a definition. Tney are nothing mere than
sums—as, for example, the Smithsonian bequest—
deposited in the care of the Government; and con-
sequently, though charged on the books of the
Treasury, cannot be included in the list of ex-
penses. Yet the amount of these funds entrusted
to the Government and paid out in 1838, was
$2,305,321 89
In 1826, the amount of funds of the
same description was only         -             266 47
Leaving the large balance of • 02,305,055 42
which must, in fairness, be deducted from the total
of alleged extravagance.
It can scarcely require an argument to prove that
the amount disbursed for indemnities in 1838,
.hould not be charged to the Government, in order
to swell the amount of expenditures with a view to
make good the charge of extravagance. If, as has
frequently been the case, foreign powers commit
«egressions on the rights of our citizens, and de-
pr.ve them of their property, and the Government
shall afterwards redress the injuries, by obtaining
indemnities for these spoliations, and become the
mere agent of trustee for paying to its citizens the
amount thus recovered, it would indeed be drawing
largely upon the credulity of ihe people to attempt
to s'iow that afaiihtul execution of the trust is to
be converted into a charge ef extravagance. And
yet, strange as it may appear, thoss who keep con-
stantly held up to public view the gross amount of
more than 039,000,000, which they charge to have
bren expended by this Administration in 1838, not
only make no deduction on account of funds thus
paid out, but they do not even venture an explana-
tion.
In 1838 the amount paid on account of
indemnities was      ...    0975,577
In 1826 paid on the same account     -          9,967
Making the sum to be deducted
$965.610
There is yet another very large sum which, in
fairness, must be deducted from the gross expendi-
tures of 1838 I allude to the amount disbursed in
that year in the construction of durable fire-proof
buildings, for the preservation of the public ar-
chives, records, &c. &c. This branch of expendi-
ture was not veutured on by the Administration,
until experience had taught the lesson, how impo-
litic and hazardous it was, to confid? the most va-
luab'e trusts to buildings constructed of materials
which render them liable at any moment to total
destruction. This expendi'ure, so far from bei; g
extravagant, is plainly dictated by the soundest
economy. It is temporary and contingent in its
character, and few, I think will deny, ihat it would
have been more conducive to the public interests
had it been met at an earlier day.
The large sum ot 01,009,084, the excess paid for
public buildings in 1838 over the sum rtquirsd
in 1826, must, in fairness, be deducted from the
aggregate expenditures of 1838.
But it is unnecessary, for tne purpose of my ar-
gument, to weary the atiention ot ihs committee
with comments on every minor item of appropria-
tion which necessarily sw<lled the expenditures of
1838 beyond those of 1826. To mest of the fe r-
mer, my colleague, I believe, gave ihe sanction of
his vote; or, to avo d the imidiousnev of particu-
larizing him, I shall say that a majority oí h>s po-
litical iriendsgave ihem thd1-support. In justice,
therefore, all tho-e appropuations uhirh ti,ey ap-
proved, rr which all allow to be indi-p-n^abie,
must be subtracted from the mm of alleged exira-
vagancp. They must therefore deduct the sums
contained in the exhibit I here furnish, in addition
to the large nems commented ou airead}:
0439,000 00 For the protection of the Northern
frontier, ior  which  object  no-
thing was required in 1826.
262,614 00 For building light-houses beyond
the sum tequired in 1826.   The
increase in  the nu nber of the
establishments deemed necessa-
ry by Congress principally for
the convenience and sat"-ty of
the mercantile in'erests, just fies
the addional expenditure.
97,242 00 For mints.   Three  branch mints
having been  lately established
acco jnts for ihe excess.
113,860 00 Excess m pay ol Senators, owing
to the increase of their number
and the length of t -e session.
120,910 00 Excess in ihe contingent expenses
of the Senate, increase or bus'-
ness requiring more punting &c.
189,744 00 Excess in the compensation ot ihe
members   of  the   House,   ac-
counted for by there being twen-
ty more Representatives, and by
the length of the session.
177,617 00 Donations in money to  the  Dis-
trict of Columbia, an occasional
expenditure only, accounted for
by the peculiar circumstances
of the District.
454,586 00 For duties refunded.   There was
no such charge on the Treasury
in 1826.
161,413 00 For  fie   Exploring   Expedit on.
There was no such expendnure
in 1826.
186,878 00 The^lfference between the expen-
ditures for the Mihia-y Acade-
my in the two years
190,354 00 For the salaries of custom-hou e
officer*, paid out of the Treasu-
ry, fiom 1833, to render their
salaries   equal   to   what   they
we.e prior to the tariff act  of
that year.
02,394,218 00 Form the sum total of these
smailrr items.
To tliiá amount add the aggregate
of the various divisions ot indis-
pensable and approved expen-
diture, on which my remarks
have been extended to greater
length, viz;
1,251,998 74
288,041 78
4,810,^76 21
3,804,359 20
1,188,876 66
556,824 96
1,874.106 10
2,305,055 42
1,0'9,084 00
965,610 00
Excess in 1838 for the pay and
subsistence ol the army.
Excess tor fort'ficat ons, &c.
For the Indian Department.
For preveniing and suppressing
Indian hostilities.
For surveys of ports and harbors.
For revolutionary pensions.
í'or fie naval establishment.
For trust funds.
For public buildings.
For indemnities.
$20,449,151 07 make the total to be subtracted
troji the excels of 1838 over 182G. When .the
subtraction is made, it will be perceived, at a
glance, that theiharga of extravagance cannot be
sustained. That excess amounts to $20,787,400;
leaving the very sm.ill sum of 0338,249 of excess
of expenditure in 1833 over 1826; an excess
which could be very easily accounted for by a
more minute examination of the expenditures of
the two yeai^.
But my colleague cannot bp made to understand
how it is, that $39,455,438 35, disbursed in 1838,
is not to b" denounced by all, as prodigali'y in the
extreme, \th n in 1826, a year of economy, as we
are told, the expenditures were but $24.103,399 46;
when he furnishes the proof, that in 1796, trie ex-
penditures were but $2,532,930, and in some of
the precrding yeais-su i kss. Suppose I were to
call upon hun to explain to his constiiuents, and to
mine, and to the p'op'e of the country, upon what
principle it i*, tha' he cm pass highwroupht eulo-
gium* upon ihe economy of 1826, wnich had in the
space of thirty year-, increa-pd the expenditures of
this Government nearly tenfold, or one thousand
p-r een'. app ovine, as he doe;, the economy of
ejeh oí those year-; and condemn the extrava-
gance of 1838, which ha 1, in the spac of twelve
yeats, increased them but little more than seventy
percent. Do you not think, sir, that, to enable
him to account for nearly one thousand per cent.
of increas  in the space ot thirtv years, the economy
if which he approves, he would make figures full
a; fa<-t as he charges me with dome, when I under-
take to account for an increase,in twelve years.of but
li'tie more than seventy per cent.; and which he
condemns as reckle-s exiravag-mc-'? And by the
tore he-had cyphertd it ail out straight, as I doubt
not he woa'd, do joa not also think that there
would be some reason to fear, that the multitude of
wh ch he speaks, the plain common se:'se men,
would come io tne conclusion, not that the Demo-
cratic lawyers, but that these Whig lawyers, "knew
a little too much, and could figure a Utile too
well "
It must, I think, sir, be conceded, that the gross
amount of expenditures unexplained, though large,
is not per se proof of extravagance; and, conse-
quently, that no safe opinion can be formed by a
mere inspection of the aggregate. To make good
the charge, and to sathfy an m'elligent people, my
coleague will find it neees-aiy to go farrier, and
to investigate the details. He will be reqaired to
point out the spec fie items which aie objectiona-
ble; to show the objects upon which money has <
been unnecessarily and improperly expended. Lit ,
him bring forward his specifications let him po nt  ,
to the appropriations, which he conde-nns as extra-
vagant, and I have grossly deceived myse.f, if I do
net prove from the documents before me, that all
such charges are utterly groundless.
