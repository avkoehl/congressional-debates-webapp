ship belonging to North Carolina and to private parties, and entirely under the authority of the commanding general, the purpose being to prevent her from leaving port. The commanding general alone has authority here to stop or to permit them to leave. On referring to Captain Lynch for explanation, he alleges orders of the Secretary of the Navy. Having placed a guard on the Hansa, I have required the removal of the marines. He refuses, and has threatened me with using his whole force to sustain his usurpation of authority.

I forbear,to avoid collision,putting Captain Lynch and his people under guard, but for the good of the service and for harmony I request the President to remove this officer from here at once. I can permit no such interference with my command.

Please to place this before the President at once.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
