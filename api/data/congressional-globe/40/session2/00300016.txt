By order of the Secretary of "War.
Official:
E. D. TOWNSEND.
Assistant Adjutant General.
, Assistant Adjutant General.
General Emory not only called the attention
of respondent to this order, but to the fact that
it was in conformity with a section contained
in an appropriation act passed by Congress.
Respondent, after reading the order, observed,
" This is not in accordance with the Constitu-
tion of the United States, which makes me
Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy,
or of the language of the commission which
you hold." General Emory then stated that
this order had met respondent's approval. Re-
spondent then said in. reply, in substance,
" Am I to understand that the President of the
United Statesman not give an order but through
the General-in-Chief, or General Grant?"
General Emory again reiterated the statement
that it had met respondent's approval, and that
it was the opinion of some of the leading lawyers
of the country that this order was constitutional.
With some further conversation, respondent
then inquired the names of the lawyers who
had given the opinion, and he mentioned the
names of two. Respondent then said that the
object of the law was very evident, referring
to the clause in the appropriation act upon
which the order purported to be based. This,
according to respondent's recollection was the
substance of the conversation had with General
Emory.
Respondent denies that any allegations in
the said article of any instructions or declara-
tions given to the said Emory then or at any
other time contrary to or in addition to what
is hereinbefore set forth are true. Respondent
denies that, in said conversation with said
Emory, he had atiy other intent than to ex-
presathe opinions then given to the said Emory,
nor dxd_ he then or at any time request or order
the said Emory to disobey any law or any
order issued in conformity with any law, or in-
tend to offer any inducement to the said Emory
to violate any law. What this respondent then
said to General Emory was simply the expres-
sion of an opinion which he then iully believed
to be sound and which he yet believes to be so,
and that is, that by the express provisions of
the Constitution this respondent, as President,
is made the Commander-in-Chief of the Armies
of the United States, mid as such lie is to be
respected, and that his orders, whether issued
through the War Department or through the
General-in-Chief, or by any other channel of
communication, are entitled to respect and
obedience, and that such constitutional power
cannot be taken from him by virtue of any aet
of Congress. Respondent doth therefore deny
that by the expression of such opinion he did
commit or was guilty of a high misdemeanor
in office; and this respondent doth further say
that the said article nine lays no foundation
whatever for the conclusion stated in the said
ailicle, that the respondent, by reason of the
allegations therein contained, was guilty of a
high misdemeanor in office.
In reference to the statement made by Gen-
eral Emory that this respondent had approved
of said aet of Congress containing the section
referred to, the respondent admits that his
formal approval was given to said act, but ac-
companied the same by the following message,
addressed and sent with the act to the House
of Representatives, in which House the said
aet originated, and from which it came to re-
spondent :
To the Ho-use of Representatives:
The act entitled 11 An act making appropriations
for the support of the Army for the year ending June
30,1863, and for other purposes," contains provisions
to which X must call attention. These provisions are
contained in the second section, which, in certain
cases, virtually deprives the President of his consti-
tutional functions as Commander-in-Chief of the
Army, and in the sixth section, which denies to ten
States of the Union their constitutional right to pro-
tect themselves, in any emergency, by means of their
own militia. These provisions are out of place in
an appropriation act, but I am compelled to defeat
these necessary appropriations if I withhold my sig-
nature from the act. Pressed by these considera-
tions, I feci constrained to return the bill with my
signature, but to accompany it with my earnest pro-
test against the sections which I have indicated.
Washington, D. Câ€ž March 'A, 1S67.
Respondent, therefore, did no more than to
express to said Emory the same opinion which
he had so expressed to the House of Repre-
sentatives.
ANSWER TO ARTICLE X.
And in answer to the tenth article and speci-
fications thereof the respondent says that on
the 14th and 15th days of August, in the year
I860, a political convention ot delegates from
all or most, of the States and Territories of
the Union was held in the city of Philadelphia,
under the name and style of the National
Union Convention, for the purpose of main-
taining and advancing certain political views
and opinions before the people of the United
States, and for their support and adoption in
the exercise of the constitutional suffrage, in
the elections of Representatives and Delegates
in Congress, which were soon to occur in
many of the States and Territories of the
Union; which said convention, in the course
of its proceedings, and in furtherance of the
objects of the same, adopted a "declaration
of principles " and "an address to the people
of the United States," and appointed a com-
mittee of two of its members from each State
and of one from each Territory and one from the
District of Columbia to wait upon the Presi-
dent of the United States and present to him
a copy of the proceedings of the convention ;
that on the 18th day of said month of August
this committee waited upon the President of
the United States at the Executive Mansion,
and was received by him in one of the rooms
thereof, and by their chairman, Hon. Reverdy
Johnson, then and now a Senator of the
United States, acting and speaking in their
behalf, presented a copy of the proceedings
of the convention, and addressed the Presi-
dent of the United States in a speech, of which
a copy (according to a published report of the
same, and as the respondent believes substan-
tially a correct report,) is hereto annexed as a
part of this answer, and marked Exhibit C.
That thereupon, and in reply to the address
of said committee by their chairman, this re-
spondent addressed the said committee so
waiting upon him in one of the rooms of the
Executive Mansion; and this respondent be-
lieves that this his address to said committee
is the occasion referred to in the first specifi-
cation of the tenth article; but this respondent
does not admit that the passages therein set
forth,_ as if extracts from a speech or address
of this respondent upon said occasion, cor-
rectly or justly present his speech or address
upon said occasion, but, on the contrary, this
respondent demands and insists that if this
honorable court shall deem the said article and
the said first specification thereof to contain
allegation of matter cognizable by this honor-
able court as a high misdemeanor in office,
within the intent and meaning of the Constitu-
tion of the United States, and shall receive or
allow proof in support of the same, that proof
shall be required to be made ofthe actual speech
and address of this respondent on said occa-
sion, which this respondent denies that said
article and specification contain or correctly
or justly represent.
And this respondent, further answering the
tenth article and the specifications thereof, says
that at Cleveland, in the State of Ohio, and on
the ad day of September, in the year 1866, he
was attended by a large assemblage of his fel-
low-citizens, and in deference and obedience to
their call and demand he addressed them upon
matters of public and political consideration ;
and this respondent believes that said occasion
and address are referred to in the second spe-
cification of the tenth article ; but this respond-
ent does not admit that the passages therein
set forth, as if extracts from a speech of this
respondent on said occasion, correctly or justly
present his speech or address upon said occa-
sion ; but, on the contrary, this respondent de-
mands and insists that if this honorable court
shall deem the said article and the said second
specification thereof to contain allegation of
matter cognizable by this honorable court as a
high misdemeanor in office, within the intent
and meaning of the Constitution of the United
States, and shall receive or allow proof in sup-
port of the same, that proof shall be required
to be made of the actual speech and address
of this repondent on said occasion, which this
respondent denies that said article and specifi-
cation contain or correctly or justly represent.
And this respondent, further answering the
tenth article and the specifications thereof, says
that at St. Louis, in the State of Missouri, and
on the 8th day of September, in the year 18G6,
he was attended by a numerous assemblage of
his fellow-citizens, and in deference and obe-
dience to their call and demand he addressed
them upon matters of public and political con-
sideration; and this respondent believes that
said occasion and address are referred to in the
third specification of the tenth article; but this
respondent does not admit that the passages
therein set forth, as if extracts from a speech
of this respondent on said occasion, correctly
or justly present his speech or address upon
said occasion; but, on the contrary, this respon-
dent demands and insists that if this honorable
court shall deem the said article and the said
third specification thereof to contain allegation
of matter cognizable by this honorable court as
a high misdemeanor in office, within the intent
and meaning of the Constitution ofthe United
States, and shall receive or allow proof in sup-
port of the same, that proof shall be required
to be made of the actual speech and address of
this respondent on said occasion, which this
respondent denies that the said article and spe-
cification contain or correctly or justly repre-
sent.
And this respondent, further answering the
tenth article, protesting that he has not been
unmindful of the high duties of liis office, or
of the harmony or courtesies which ought to
exist and be maintained between the executive
and legislative branches of the Government of
the United States, denies that he has ever in-
tended or designed to set aside the rightful
authority or powers of Congress, or attempted
to bring into disgrace, ridicule, hatred, con-
tempt, or reproach the Congress of the United
States or either branch thereof, or to impair
or destroy the regard or respect of all or any
of the good people of the United States for
the Congress or the rightful legislative power
thereof, or to excite the odium or resentment
of all or any of the good people of the United
States against Congress and the laws by it
duly and constitutionally enacted. This re-
spondent, further says that at all times he has,
in his official acts as President, recognized the
authority of the several Congresses of the
United States as constituted and organized
during his administration of the office of Presi-
dent of the United States.
And this respondent, further answering, says
that he has, from time to time, under his con-
stitutional right and duty as President of the
United States, communicated to Congress his
views and opinions in regard to such acts or
resolutions thereof as, being submitted to him
as President of the United States in pursuance
of the Constitution, seemed to this respondent
to require such communications; and he has,
from time to time, in the exercise of that free-
dom of speech which belongs to him as a citi-
zen of the United States, and, in his political
relations as President of the United States to
