Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND,Assistant Adjutant-General, U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

Your three dispatches relative to allowing officers in the regular regiments to receive appointments in the volunteer service have been received.

As very many of the best officers in the regular regiments have already been transferred to volunteer commands, thereby leaving a majority of the officers young and inexperienced and requiring the instruction and example of the few remaining older officers, I do not think the officers you allude to could be spared without manifest detriment to the service-at all events in the present uncertain state of affairs.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,Harrison's Landing, Va., July 31, 1862

Three small schooners, one little black steamboat, and two hulks fitting up for some purpose comprised the entire navy on the river within view.

Very respectfully,

F. J. PORTER.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
