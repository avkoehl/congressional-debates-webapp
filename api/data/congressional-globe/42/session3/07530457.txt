Remarks.
Cvstox-Huuse, Poet IIuro.v, Septtmlcr 30, 1872.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. Is the time of the
House to be farmed out on a bill of this import-
ance by one member hoar by hour? He says
that he will yield to one gentleman, and then
the remaining time to other gentlemen, and
the whole thine is to be under his control.
Mr. CONGER. I will yield whatever re-
mains of my hour to the gentleman from Mis-
souri, [Mr. Fixkelxburg,] and when my hour
expires the rest of the lime for discussion of
course will be under control of the Speaker.
Mr. W. R. ROBERTS. How much of the
gentleman's time remaius?
The SPEAKER. Twenty-fonr minutes of
vfcis hour remain.
Mr. FINKELNBURG. Mr. Speaker, it ia
somewhat remarkable that the national Gov-
ernment does absolutely nothing for the mil-
lions of people who come here with their labor,
their skill, their ability, and their property, to
take part in the development of our country,
and who are sooner or later to form an integral
part of our nation. The waut of familiarity,
oa the part of the immigrant on his first arrival
on oar shores, with our language localities,
values, ic., presents a wide field for unscrupu-
lous men to practice upon, not to speak of
the cupidity of ship-owners and railroad com-
panies, who frequently treat immigrants in the
most barbarous and shocking manner while in
transitu.
We iiave numerous voluntary associations in
this country who give such aid and assistance
to immigrants as lies in their power. But
their sphere of action is necessarily limited
and contracted, and they cannot adequately
control the subject. Then we have the so-
called Castle Garden institution in New York
city. Xhere is no doubt that institution has
done much good. I do not wish to detract
from any credit which is due to it. Undoubt-
edly there is a great improvement from the
time when poor immigrants were absolutely
turned loose upon the mercy of the thousands
of scalpers and runners who used to infest the
wharves of New York city for the special
purpose of preying upon immigrants. But
while that institution has done much good, it
is also true that during the last five years or
so great complaints have been made against
Gastle Garden ; complaints so loud, so numer-
ous, so serious iu their character as to force
themselves upon the attention of the public.
As far as these complaints refer to misman-
agement of that institution I have no personal
knowledge of the grounds which may be at
the bottom of them ; and it would be, perhaps,
improper in me to refer to them. They have
never been officially investigated that I know
of, and I will not speak of them. All that 1
know of the subject everybody else knows
from the press and the discussions which have
taken place in regard to it. But I do know
this, that Castle Garden or any other State
institution cannot adequately control this sub-
ject.
I know that no institution of the State of
New York can protect the immigrants while
on shipboard. 1 know that no institution of
the State of New York can protect the immi-
grant after he leaves that city and takes the
train or the boat for the western country. I
know also that Castle Garden is confined to
that port alone, and that immigrants come to
a great many other ports of the United States
where there, is absolutely no provision made
for their protection, such as Port Huron, in
Michigan, which has become a very important
place for immigrants, New Orleans, Baltimore,
Boston, and other places.
Then there is another point. I object to the
tax which the State of New York levies' upon
immigrants on their way to the West. This tax
has been referred to already by the gentleman
from Michigan, [Mr. Conger.] Until recently
it was $2 50 per head, and is called, Ibelicve,
technically, "head money." This money is
levied by the State of New York, or by the
board of emigration r~~ 'u~
commissioners, for the
avowed purpose of taking care of immigrants
after their arrival. And yet we all know that
nine tenths, I might say ninety-nine hundredths,
of the immigrants who come to this country
leave the jurisdiction of the State of New York
JOHN P. SANBORN, Collector.
within twenty-four hours after their arrival,
and they are not entitled to a dollar of this
money after they leave the State. It is well
known that this condition of things has given
rise to a large surplus of that emigration fund
in the State of New York, a-part of which I
believe was lost in a bank not long ago. And,
if I am not misinformed, there is now a law in
the State of New York which provides that
this surplus may in some way, 1 do not know
exactly how, be divided among the counties
of that State, to be used for the support of a
sort of pauper houses. I have uot seen the
law, but that is my information. At any rate
I believe that tax is an unjust one, and what is
more, I believe it is an unconstitutional and
unlawful tax.
Mr. COX. If the gentleman will allow me
to interrupt him, I wish to correct him in re-
gard to one point to which he has just alluded.
The State of New York takes care at Ward's
Islaud of some two thousand poor immigrants.
In other parts of the State there are other hos-
pitals where immigrants also are cared for,
and they are cared for during five years after
their arrival.
Mr. FINKELNBURG. Provided they stay
in the State of New York; but the moment
they go West they get no benefit.
Mr. W. R. ROBERTS. They are entitled
to it also if they return.
Mr. FINKELNBURG. An immigrant may
be laid up in the city of Chicago without a
cent in his pocket, sick, unable to do anything,
and he is not entitled to one cent out of this
fund, which comes altogether from the immi-
grants themselves. I believe I am correct in
that proposition.
Now, Mr. Speaker, this subject has attracted
so much attention that several conventions
have been held in regard to it. It has at-
tracted particular attention in the West, where
we are more closely interested in the whole
subject of immigration. One of those con-
ventions, very uumerously attended, called by
the Governors of the States of Minnesota,
Iowa, Wisconsin, Missouri, and Illinois, I
