Major C. S. STRINGFELLOW, Asst. Adjt. General:

MAJOR: The scouts have just returned; they report the arrival of fifteen pieces of artillery at Fayetteville, and great activity among the steam-boats on the Kanawha River. The enemy has rebuilt the a large hospital at the same place. The scouts think the enemy intends to attempt a move through to the railroad. The citizens with whom they conversed told them that the Yankees make no secret of it, and say that they will move when Grant is ready. I give you the report as they make it, and they are sensible and reliable men.

Respectfully,

JNO. McCAUSLAND,

Colonel, Commanding.

STAUNTON, April 20, 1864.

Major General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Saw General Imboden to-day at Mount Crawford. His scouts report that Sixth Army Corps, of Grant's army, arrived at Martinsburg the 16th instant, and Averell left last week for the west with his entire command; it is supposed for another raid on your line. General Sullivan is said to have concentrated 8,000 men at Beverly. Will return to-morrow if no further instructions are received.

B. L. POOR,
