DARK CORNER, September 30, 1864.

Brigadier-General IVERSON,

Commanding Cavalry:

General Hood desires you should report daily in future, whether anything important transpires with you or not; he desires you to put on a line of couriers from your headquarters to Moore's Bridge, where we will have a station, or near there, as I am having a line put on to Newnan. Brigadier-General Govan has been directed while he remains at Moore's Bridge to co-operate with you in resisting any cavalry movement against the WEST Point railroad.

[A. P. MASON.

Assistant Adjutant-General.]
