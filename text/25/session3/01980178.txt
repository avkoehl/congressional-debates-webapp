INTERFERENCE IN  ELECTIONS.
The St nate then proceeded to the consideiation
of the bill to pievent the mteiference of Federal
offieeis in elections, and the special order of the
day, when
Mi RIVES addicsscd the Senate at length,
and with much earnestness, against the leport of
the Committee on the Judieniy,and, in conclud-
ing, stated his giett disapprobation of the doc- |
tunes contained m the lepoitof the Judiciary
Committee, and said that the Senate owed it to
itself to i evoke the sanction ¡t had given to it by ¡
punting an extia numbci of copies of it With
this view, he submitted a set of it solutions con-
demnaloiy of the leport, and contludmg with an
amtndment to it He submitted to his filend
fiom Kentucky, [Mi Cuitilndin,] whether
they could not both accomplish the object they
had in view by adopting these resolutions in lieu
of the bill about which many gentlemen enter- I
tuned constitutional sciuples                                      '
Mi   R  then read the lesolutions, and moved  |
tht y be printed                                                              ,
Mi PIERCE desired to know in what charac-
ter the gentleman's resolutions were offered,
win thci tl ey were moved as an independent ptop- ¡
osition, or as an amendment to the bill If the
foimei, it was cleaily not in ordei to íeceive
tht m
Mi BUCHANAN observed that it was always
best to do one thing at a time The issue had .
bet ii fanly made by the St nator fiom Kentucky, '
[VIi CitirrtNDrs,] on his bill as introduced, and
lit intended, toi one, at some convenient time, to
give his sentimt nts with regard to it Though
he wis disposed, on all occasions, to show eveiy
eouitesy to his fellow membeis of the Senate, yet
lit was not disposed to permit the issue to be
chungt d it this time 1 he honorable Senatoi
ñ oni Vugima could, at the proper time to morí o w,
bung f irwaid his resolutions and hive the sense
of the Senate on tin m, and ho should be very
natly to considei them, but on this question he
wanted the bill, the whole bill, and nothing but '
tht bill                                                                          I
Mi WALL complained of the unfan manner
in which tht Senatoi fiom Virginia hud tieated j
the report It was plain to every man of common
si nsi m the community that no such mfeience
tould be diawn from it as the one diawn by the
St mtoi fiom Vugima 1hecommittee,(Mi W
said,) in this lepoit, was discussing the lights of
citiiens, and the Senatoi would not pretend to
deny th itofheeholdeis were citizens? He begged
have to tell the Senatoi fiom Vnginia that what-
ever new lights he might now have, thtt the dis-
tim turn he had made was not to be found m the
Constitution What,sir' (said Mi W,)aiothe
ofliectsof this Govemmt lit a distinct ind sepa-
rtti class fiom tli people' Are those whom the
people have imiustcd with the tiansiction of
thin busint ss, dlitns to them' Was this tht
I)i m >eiacy that tl e Senator had latdy acquned ?
\h W oljeetedto having these lesolutions at
«11 onntcttd with the report, and he considered
tint by so doing, it would be placing an unfan
constant Hon upon it
Mi   KING was much surprised that the Sen-
ator from Viiginn should think of mtioducing
these lesolutions m connection with the lepoit
¡The ieport(\Ii  K sud) was not before the Sen-
ate, and could m no «i) be subject to amend
ment    It was an answer to a oill, which bill was
now befoie the Senate m Committee of the Whole,
and that, and that alone, was subject to amend
ment     With the same piopuety might the Sen   |l
atoi propose to amend the speech of the Senator ,
i fiom New Jersey, as to propose an amendment
to the íeport All parliamentai y law was against
it If the gentleman would bung forward his
resolutions in a pi opei mannei, and at a proper
timt, he would chtcifully give them every neees-
saiy consideiation But he hoped they would go
on with the bill, unconnected with any mattei
foieign to it, and dispose of it as eaily as practi-
cable, for he apprehended tljat the business of
the countiy might suffer by a protracted discus
sion
Mr RIVES asked of the Senatoi from Ala-
bama, who was so well versed in pailiamentary
law, of which hepiofessedtohave but little knowl-
edge, if it was not in his power to move to íecom-
mit the bill with instructions
Mr KING said ceitamly the Senator could
make that motion
Mi RIVES said his object was to get his res-
olutions printed and befoie the Senate, and to
have them adopted as an antidote to the repoit.
He cared not how this was done, whether by a
lecommitment oi otherwise With íegard to his
Democracy, it was not as new as that of the Sen-
atoi from New Jersey, which, as he understood,
went back only to 1812, while his he could trace
back to 1798 He thought the gentleman ought
to have followed him step by step in his argument
commenting on this ltpoit, instead of complain-
ing of the infeiences drawn in one portion of it
Mr CUTHBERT asked if he was to tmdei-
stand of the gentleman from Vngmia that he pro-
poses to lecommit the bill with the report of the
Judiciary Committee, for the purpose of having
these lesolutions íeported distinct, without the
bill'
Mi  RIVES replied m the arKtmative
Mi CUTHBERT rejoined, that the gentleman
then shiunk from the defense of the bill. A bill
(he said) had been introduced by the Senator fiom
Kentucky, [Mi Ciuttevden,] of a character
which provoked the severest censures in this íe-
poit The gentleman, therefore, justified the
íeport when he shiunk fiom the defense of the
bill
Mi RIVES said he did not undettake to de-
cide the question as to the bill in its piesent shape
He proposed to recommit it with instructions to
introduce these lesolutions, and also to make a
leport on the bill, so that he did not give up the
principle contimed in it
Mi CRITTENDEN was understood to say
that he piefeired that the bill should not be le-
committed at this time He wished the argument
to go on, though he believed the Senator had an
undoubted ught to move Us recommitment
Mi RIVES obseived that the Senatoi from
Alabama [Mr Kivg] admitted that he had the
ught to move to recommit the bill, with instiuc-
tionsto bung in these lesolutions
Mr KING said headmitted no such thing He
admitted neithei moie nor less than that it was
in the power of the Senatoi to move to recommit
the bill with instiuctions to amend the bill itself,
and if the Senate chose to make the instiuctions
positive, it could do it But all parliamentary
mies showed that the Senator could not move to
recommit the bill, with instiuctions to amend the
lepoit of the committee that had been made on it,
oi to bring m a string of lesolutions having the
same ob|er t
Mr RIVES observed that the Senate would see
his object, and he was indifTeient how ¡t was ob-
tained, all he wanted was to have the lesolutions
printed, so as to have them before the Senate, and
to allow him to consider in what way he could
best obtain the object he had m view m drafting
them.
The VICE PRESIDENT said  the  Senator
could  not mtioduee lus   lesolutions   while  the
subject unuer discussion  yet  lemained  undis
posed of
Mr JNORVELL observed that he desired to
iddioss the Sr nate on the subject of the bill, but
as it was too late in the day foi that object, and
yet too eaily to adjourn, be would propose that
the hill be pissed over informally, and that they
pioceed to the consideration of thegeneial ordcis.
This was agieed to
Mr RIVES then submitted the following les-
olutions, and moved that they be punted, which
was adopted
Whereas "the constitutional remedy by the elective
principle becomes nothing if it may be smothered by the
enormous pationago oí tlie General Government," and
