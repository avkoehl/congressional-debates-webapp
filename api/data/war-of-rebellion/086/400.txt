(Via Saint Louis, Mo.)

I cannot designate the route for Smith's march. All I can say is, send him by the shortest in time. It is exceedingly important the he should re-enforce General Thomas as speedily as possible. The first that reach the transports should go at once to Paducah and await their trains there.
