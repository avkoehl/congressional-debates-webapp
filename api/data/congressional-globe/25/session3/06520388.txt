Pubiic Defaulters—Mr. Wise.
Ho. Of Reps.
as to whom patents weie to be issued, decided
in the last resort, that it was found necessary to
have some one interested with speculators, who
had the good will and the ear of the President, to
influence his decisions, that Amos Kendall was
selected by one of the companies, the Boston
Land Company, as their palace pimp, let into
profits to the amount of $50,000, perhaps without
the advance on his pait of a cent, but merely in
consideration of his good will with, the President
in deciding upon the issuing of patents. All this
was given to me in writing through a responsible
person, who vouched for the source whence the
information was derived This charge was handed
to me in writing, with the caption, " Story of
Indian reservations." When Mr. Kendall was
befoie the committee I handed him the paper,
and propounded to him the interrogatory:
" Will you please look upon the paper handed you, and
state what you know respecting the laets therein spoken
of 
The question was objected to by Mr Mann,
and rejected as follows
" Yeas—Mr Campbell, Mr Lincoln, Mr Wise—3
"Nays—Mr Hannegin, Mr  Muhlenberg, Mr  Pearce,
Mr Parks, Mr Mann, Mr Clianey—6 "
The question was not allowed to be put—sizc-
ace, or rather size-tray, was the throw Thus
«hielded, Mr. Postmaster Kendall then assumed
pretty high airs He began to be bold, and ac-
tually made a fuss about the matter' Sir, he
wrote us a letter—a letter full of indignant vn -
tue' Amos's virtue' A#soon as I icceived this
letter, I immediately (February 18, 1837) offered
the following resolution.
" Communication from Mr Kendall
" Mr Wise presented and read a letter from Hon Amos
Kendall, with a request by tbx writer tint it be entered on
the journal, whereupon, Mr Wise submitted the follow
ing
" Resolved, That, whereas the chairman of this commit
tee did offer to propound a certain question, to wit   ' Will
you please to look upon the paper handed you, and sintt
what you know respecting the facts therein spoken ot"
The paper handed was m these words
" ( Story of the Indian reservations
" (Some yenrB ago, certain tracts of land, situated pnn
cipallv or wholly in the State of Mississippi, were roserved
by Congress (or by Indnn troaty to which Congress assent
ed) for the use of the Indians, and to he disposed of by ihein,
and for their benefit, whenever the President ol tin United
States should give his assent to such sale and tr uistcr, (not
otherwise ) These lands were known to be vi ly i ilunble,
and the poor Indians could be easily enough m ina^ed—
perhaps they had, or were ibout to leave, the enst (or the
west side ot the Mississippi river, but how to obtain the
assent of the President to so laige a sale ol Indian linds to
a company ol speculators seemed a more difficult matter
A company was lormed in Boston, two or three years airo,
with, as it Is believed, n capital of i$J00,t)00, to try to f llect
this object Amos Biiiiicj, ksq , was a h titling man in the
comí any, and it is believed that Brodhead u ivv igent it
Boston, was another, and various other individual* had a
greater or Itss interest in it, but what did, us is believed,
obtain the President's assent to the sale and irmslcr, was
the admission of Amos Kendall, nt present Postmaster Gen
eral, into the concern , he to have one third part ot the
profits ol the speculation when it shall he clost d up with
out, in laet, paying one dollar of the consideration, although
he may appear to hive paid his pan as well as ill the other*
Yet the agreement of the other partners with Mr Kendall
was, that they would furnish the money to pay Ins one third
Íiart of the consideration, free fioin interest, provided he,
Cendall, would obtain the assent of the Pr< sident to (lie sale,
and would, when requested so to do by the other partners,
go to the lands and transact such milters and tilings rel it
ing to their common interest as the company might deem
expedient I he lands were purchased bv the eompinv,
therefore, we are to infer tint Mr Ke i lili did obtain llie
President's assent to the snle , but Mr Kendall was not,
and probably will notbe,cil!ed on for invf unlit r st rvices
'those interested in the purehase spi ak confidently of their
expectation of realizing, at the cud of the siles, three oi
four dollars for everyone invested 1 he ptoplt oí the
United Stiles, by this tiansaction, h ive not bien defi lUded
or overreached , but the interest ot the Indians in these res
ervitions his probuly been obtuntd by Ihis eompinv lor
less than hill its m irket value How fir the President
should guard the interest of the Indians is for linn and Con
gress to determine possibly it may have some connection
with Ins oath of office liut if the interests ol the Indians
must or may be sacrificed, shall it be so done for the bene
fit of a few favorites, and it the sole suggestion of one jn
dividual, himself more deeply interested than any other "
which this comraitteee refused to permit to be propound! d
to Amos Kendall, and whereas the said Kendall has this
day communicated tlie following letter, to wit
"' Washington, February 20, 1837
"   Sir   You will remember thai, while I was under ex
animation belore your committee, an anonymous letter was
produced, and made the basis of a question, which the com
mittee refused to let me answer, although requested    Of
that refusal I do not complain , but I complain that the
anonymous letter was permitted to be put on your journal
"' That tester, sir, i  an atrocious libel on the President
of the United States and on myself, and, m all its essential
parts, is uttei ly false I never made such i bargain as is
therem described, nor has the President, under such cir-
cumstances, or under any others, so far I know and believe,
confirmed the salesof any Indian lands purchased by a Bos-
ton company
" 'Ihislnramous libel his been pliced upon your journal,
it is presumed it will be rt ported to the House, and will
thus be published   And where is my remedy?  By the Con
sntution and laws of my country, I am authorized to seek
protection for my chaiaeter, as well as my person, from the
attacks of private citizens, in the courts of justice , but in
this case, members of Congress, around whom the Consti
stution spreads the shield of privilege, become the publish
ers, and the name of the libeler is withheld from me    Of
this T complain    By me, the immunity of a member of
Congress, in the pertormance of his public dunes, will ever
be held sacred    But I deny his right to extend the like im
munity to every villain in the country who has malice
enough to stab, but not courage enough to meet the respon
sibihty    I deny his right to receive and publish under his
privilege, any anonymous libel in any shape     To say the
least, it is an abuse of a constitutional immunity, which
was granted for purposes more noble and more just
'"I ask, thereloro that the name of the libeler in this
case may be iscertuned and communicated to me After
entering the libel upon their journal, the committee, I re
specttully conceivt, cannot, in justice, do less than place
me in nn attitude wheie I may avaii myself of the protection
ind redress whieh the Constitution and laws promise, in
like c ises, to everv citi7cn
"' Very respectlully, your obedient servant,
'"AMOS KENDALL
"'Hon  Henry A Wise, Chairman, a-c '
tins committee will proceed to examine into the facts and
circumai mees involv d in, ind alluded to, by the said
question and the sanl letter, ind will cause witnesses to
be summoned to prove or disprove the said facts and cir
cumstanccs
" Whieh resolution was rejected by the following vote
"Yeas—Mr Cimpbell, Mr Lincoln, Mr Wise—3
"Nays—Mr   Pearce, Mr   Hannegan, Mr   Parks, Mr
Mann, Mr Clianey—5 "
Thus, sir, I took him in his temper and at his
word, and proposed to try the truth of the charge
and the sincenty of his passion, but the vote of
the committee was the same agatn—the same old
thiow—8i7e-tray' 1 had put this same mtenog
atory to Kendall,eye to eye, face to face It was
explicit and specific He was willing, oh ' how
willing, to answer it' But then, sn, his own
friends on committee were so cruel and unjust as
to allow the charge to go upon the journal unan-
swered Not exactly so either I caught David
Henshaw, of Boston, in the city I put him upon
the witness stand After proposing to him nu
merous questions, which the committee íejectid,
1 did get m one or two questions, and as many
answeis, which satisfied me fully that theie was
foundation for the mfoimation given to me
" Question 9   Hive you any information of persons in
tsrosted Willi Mr Kend ill in the profits ol buying and selling
public land '   If so, state vvh it
£< Jlnswer I have no information of any persons inter
ested, at this time, with Mr Kendall, m the profits of buying
and selling public lands
" Question 10 Have you anv information of persons who
have been interested with Mr Kendall since he has been an
evecutive officer, in the profits of buying and selling public
lands3
" Objected to bv Mr Parks and rejected ns follows
"Yeas—Mr Muhlenbeig and Mr Wise— 2
' Nays—Mr IIuiine¿an, Mr Parks, Mr Mann, and Mr
Clianey—4 "
The committee could not be coaxed to permit
fair and full investigation
Sir, I could show you pile upon pile of proof,
but these instances will sci ve as specimens of the
manner in which you, the Speaker, the Piesident
of the United Stales, the heads of the Executive
Depaitments, yout committee, and your whole
paity, combined and conspired to stifle investiga
Hon, when proposed in 1837
Sir, not only did you and the Administration
puisue this course upon the committee toexamine
the condition of the various Executive Depart
ments, of which I was chauman, but, m like
manner, you played the same game on the com
mittee and towards the committee of which my
fuend and colleague (Mr Garland] was chair
man. You repehed inquuy, refused interrogato
nes, prostrated and postponed resolutions, encour-
aged contumacy in witnesses, resisted investiga-
tion in eveiy form theie, too, with this difference
only, that theie the usual thtow of the die was
"cinque four" instead of " size tray," my col-
league, the chairman, usually voting with the
minority of three—Johnson, Peyton, and Wise
Such was your reform Administration ' You
denied, resisted, and defeated all investigation, all
inquiry. One of the committee was appointed
to sit on. Reuben, and the other on Levi. One
was to investigate the pet bank concern, the other
was to examine the virtue and honesty of the
Treasury Department. Sir, Reuben and Levi
were then in Co—they "rode and tied." But
how soon, sir, did truth—"mighty truth, pie
vail," notwithstanding all your resistance and
attempts to stifle her mighty throes' Sir, this
was in the session of 1836-37, these committees
reported on the 3d of March, before sixty days
expired, the explosion of the pet banks, the crush
of credit, the destruction of confidence and com-
merce, the ruin of everything, proclaimed, thun-
dered the truth of my charges, to establish which
the Garland committee was raised—thundered it,
sir, in the ears of every man—touched the nerves
of every man's pocket, and was literally so tan-
gible as to be felt by every man, woman, and child
in the country. The Secretary Levi himself ad-
mitted the system to be corrupt and unsafe to the
called session, and poor Reuben has been turned
to the dogs And now, sir, the truth of the
charges against the Departments is about to be
verified as clearly by the explosion of the sub-
tieasurers,Swaitwout,Pnce, Gratiot,ond others,
as the tiuth of the charges in relation to the pet
banks was made manifest by their explosion '
Some of Mr Wise's friends entreated him to
yield the floor for a motion to adjourn
Mr WISE. No, sir, I do not yield the floor
I may neverget it again until the 4th of March,
1839 I will go on, without turning aside from
my purpose, to expose these outrages upon the
country I feel bettei now, much better, sir I
was sick last night, these documents made me
sick I was poiing over them late last night.
The discussion of them makes me perspire, the
perspiration comes nowfieely,and lam relieved
I distiust you,, sir, to be frank, I will go on, and
you must beai it
Tu it came the explosion of the pet banks—
now come the explosions, one after another, in
quick succession,of the sub-treasurers who were,
or aie to be, substituted for banks, and I will
show you that they prove all I ever charged to
be true
I said that in December, 1836, when General
Tarkson gave his certificate that all was well,
honest, fair, this very leg treasury, Swartwout,
at New York, was in default &336.718 Well,
su, now it appears that, in twelve months after,
he was in default to the tune of $1,016,955 ' and,
thiee. months after that time, was a defaulter in
the still Iaiger sum of $1,225,705 69 ' Piemous
to my attempt at investigation, he had been steal-
ing public money at the rate of $56,000 pei an-
num .After the cat was belled, he stole in one
year $680 936 63, and in the next three months
$208,780 37 Yes, an, after the President had
given him a eeitificatc of honesty, and you, sir,
and the House, and the committee, and the Ex-
ecutive, had shielded him fiom nil scrutiny, he
stole in one yeni the sum of $6S0,236 63, and in
the nexttlnee months at the late of more than
eight hundied thousand dolíais per annum—his
dt falcation aveiaging, thioughout his official ca-
red, the sum of more than one hundred and sev-
enty thousand dollars pei annum, for seven years
—and tins, too, we are now told, without the least
suipicion ' " A Jew may believe it   but I don't'"
Sir, I said the other day that 7 did not rejoice
in these public losses and calamities, though I
confessed I did feel a thiill of tuumph. at having
gained a victory for the truth. The pet bank
system and the sub-treasurers have exploded, as
1 said they would, and exposed their hidden
enormities, concealed until they could be con-
cealed no longer, but I do not rejoice at it I
made me no booth to sit and watch for the de
struction of conupt Nineveh But, sir, there is
one poor human being on this earth, alone now
in the woild, wrecked in reputation, blasted,
slighted by men not half as worthy as he, whose
soul at scenes like these does rejoice, must exult.
Who, and wheie is he> Sir, if you will godown
Pennsylvania avenue to the corner of Four-and-
a-half street, beneath Mrs Peyton's boarding-
house, vou will find a gray headed man, stricken
in years, his name is Tobias Watkins' That
man, for bon owing money of public officers, funds
in their hands, not converting funds in his own
hands to his own use, was imprisoned on the
14th of August, 1829, and tried on three several
indictments, on all of which he was convicted
