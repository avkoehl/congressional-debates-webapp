CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
That the late President «houlcl have come
in for a full measure of condemnation is not
wondeiful, considering the tone m which the oppo-
sition have spoken of him ever since the commence-
ment of his administration But, sir, I wi'l not
imitate the example of those -who hat eascribed the
late commercial revulsion to Execotive usurpation,
by relying on a mere contradicuon of their charge,
although, in all fairness, 1 might do so
The first specification against General Jackson
is, that by refusing to sanction the .echarter oí the
United States Bank, he opened the field for the
«reation and operation of Sta'e banks without limi-
tation or control, and, as a conseq«""nce, that the
country has been flooded with irredeemable paper
And here it may be proper to remark, that the oppo-
nents of the late and present administrations je
not agreed whether the paper currency has, or has
not, been extended to an unreasonable amount If
I did not greatly misunderstand the honorable gen-
tleman from South Carolina, a considerable poi tion
of his remarks \* as intended to show thai the local
bank issues had, at no period, gone bet ond their
proper and healthfgl proportion to the specie m this
country If his argument be trae—and for the pre-
sent I shall pass it by without further examination—
this grave charge of Executive influence in pro-
ducing an unsafe increase of bank cap tal and cir-
culation, must fall to the ground That the veto
npon the bill to recharter the United Sfat-s Bank
in 1832, may hare had some influence m increasing
the establishment of local banks, and their conse-
quent issues, I might be disponed to ?dmit, if the
testimony of a distinguished financier, high in the
confidence of my honorable friend from South
Carohaa, together with considerations connected
with it, did not go to establish the contrary It is
well known that the advocates, ot a national bank
base their support of that measure on the ground
hat it can and will so regulateand control the i sues
of the local banks, as to keep them in a sound and
healthy condition Tor the purpose oí the present
argument, it is sufficient that I admit it It is
equally well known, that after a charter had been
«ranted to the stockholders of the late United States
Bank by the State of Pennsylvania, its President
corgratulated them upon its severance of the con-
nection which had existed between the Govern-
ment and the old bank, because it was better
for both, and the bank was stronger without
it than with it Put this testimony togethei,
and how dare an} gentlernan *o s y tint the circu-
lation of the loc il banKs has b«e) unsoi nd or ex"es-
sive? They shall not dstredtt their onn witness,
Mr Buldle, for the purpose of extricating them-
selves from thp contradic ions by which they are
eavi oned What theu is the result? Either that
there has been no excess of local bank paper in
c rculauon, or a national bank is impotent to re-
strain it I care not which horn of the dilemma
gentlemen may select—either is fatal to their favo-
rite scheme of a national bank If I understood
«be honorable gentleman from South Carolina, he
argued, or if he did not so argue, it is a fair in-
ference iiom nis remarks upon the currency, that
there had been no over-trading m this countr}
And here, too, if I am correct m my recollection
of what was siid by thatgemleman, he s sustained
by the testimony of Mr Biddle, given m a letter
adJre Std to the distinguished member from Mas-
sdcuu etls (Mr Adams) about the tune Congr ss
eonvened in 1836, in winch he showed by the state
of foreign exenange that this country had not over
traded
It is true tint in a subsequent letter, add-cssed
by him to the same distinguished individual, he d d
say that we h?d eaten, and diunken, and worn, a
little too much, and we must pa} for it How his
friends can reconcile he inconsistency, it is not for
me to deteimme Put as other gentlemen haye
pursued a line of argument t erv A Te^tnt from
that trodden \y my fuend fiom Smth Carolina, it
may be necessary that I should show in xui-it they
hare been mistaken, Tne\ seem to thnk, ore and
all, except the honoraole g-ntiei inn /rom South
Caiolma, that the increase oí 'ocal oaiiks and
banking was occasioned entirely by the meas ires
®f General Jackson's admin stration, an i ¡n urg-
sg this efearge we fcav* bee  taunted \ ita "ie tire-
dictions of two distinguished citizens of Massa
chusetts, one a member ot thi*, (Mr Adams,) and
the other a member of another biancn of this
Government, (Mr Webster ) It is said, and I do
not pretend to question it, that it was ioretold bv
both the individuals referred to, that expansion,
ot ei-tradmg, pressure, and rum, woi Id be the re-
sult of the Executive veto of the United States
Bank charter, and the withdrawal of the public
money from the custody of that institution WeU
might those gentleman predict such a result, when
their own immediate fellow citizens were so active-
ly engaged m the bringing about its fulfilment
And here permit me to make one observation,
whoh seems to be a fair inference irom the ge-
neral tenor of the remaiks upon this subject, that
it would seem to be imputed to the friends of the
late and present administrations, thnt *hey have
mainly contributed to that creation of local banks
and banking under which it is alleged the country
is now suffeting For the purpose of ascertaining
rot only tie rate of increase oí banking capital
within the seven years fiom 1830 to 1836 inclu-
sive, and the States which have contributed to it -n
the largest proportions, I will present a table com

tration States

I have not consideicd it necessary to cairy the
compnnson further by arraying any additional
Stnte This selection probably makes it fair as if
it included all the rest But does not thp result ex-
cite our wonder' That, m five opposition States,
containing an aggregate representative population
of tw o millions and a quarter, without fi actions, and
sending to this House fort}-seven representatives,
the increase of banking capital within the period
refened to should have exceeded the increase in the
five administration States, containing a representa-
tive population of upwards of four millions, and
sending here eighty-seven representatives, by more
than nine millions of dollars, and that the increase
in Massachusetts alone, loyal as she is to a
national bank, should exceed the increase in
all the five administration States just men-
tioned, notwithstanding that the greatest com-
mercial city m the Union is situated in one
of them Hencefoiward, let no memoer of
the opposition taunt us with the increase oí local
banks and banking, nor wnh the fulfilment of
Massachusetts predictions it is pieposterous, sir
in view of these fac s, to accuse General Jackson
and his fn nds of their agency in this business
Well may it have happened that some who have
made the charge w ere unable to see the mote in
our eye, because there w as a beam m their own
Suppose, then, it be conceded for this argument
that local banks and issues have been inordinately
increased let those who have had the largest
share in the mischief take their part of the odium,
and I am satisfied But until tney shall have done
so, let then not igain say that wo did it I might
have advfited to facts m the banking history of
otner States under the control of those opposed to
the late and present administrations, by which the
disproportion would be increased, but it can not be
necessary As I have shown the relative increase
of banks in a series of administration and anti*
administration States, 1 will make a single observa-
tion upon th  subject of the general expansion of
the paper circulation which is believed to have
occurred since the first of December, 1833 At
that period, the order ha I been but lecently issued
to changa the custody of the public money fro g
the Bark of the United States to the local bank?.
Eve ry one remembers the panic and pressure
which existed from a short time after the meeting
of Congrpss in 1833, to the close of that protracted
session in 1834 There was no expansion, there
could hat e been none, in the panic stricken state
of the countty throughout that whole session It
is true that with n a shoit time after the adjourn-
ment the stoi n subsided, and things gradually
returned to tneir accustomed channels What fol>
lowed1
It has been asseited, and, so far as I know, with-
out contradiction, that from about November,
1834, to July, 1835, the Bank of the United States
extended its discounts about twenty, and its circu-
lation about ten millions of dollars, thus taking
the lead in stimulating at its commencement, and,
as I believe, creating that veiy sp nt of speculation
under which, so far as causes in this country have
been concerned, we are now laboring
It is true, we have heard much about the effect
of the Specie circular in producing the present em-
ban ments of the country But ¡or my own part, I
have no doubt that its effect was anv thing but in-
jurious If its operation was to restrain, as it cer-
tainly must have been, and not to stimulate the spe-
culations in public lands, its effect could only have
been salutary But I forbear to go further into
that subject Before I dismiss mv review of the
causes which have contributed to tie multiplication
of loc il banks, and ft he increase of their capital, I
must leferto oncwh h,abnvea!l others, aside from
hi" i. xpandmg ic u-- es and augmented popula-
tion of the couutr, has in my opinion, been of
the most efficient in bringing about that result, and
tl nt i:> the rapid and final extinction of the public
debt since 1829 In whatever form a promise to
pay m jney may be made, it is credit, in all con-
ceivable varieties, from the open account to the ji-
suument under seal, including bank notes and
stock , w hether of corporations or the Government,
and m all these various forms may that credit be
used for commercial purposes But it is not par-
ticularly for the purpose of illustrating the com
mercial uses of the evidences of the public debt,
that I now speak of the effect produced by the re-
demption of that debt upon the banking institu-
tions of the counliy I intend to speak of it merely
as producing a transfer of capital from one em-
ployment to another In the } ear 1830, the pub-
lic debt amounted to forty millions of dollars, which
was redeemed m the short period of four years
A very latge portion of that debt, how much it
is not particularly necessary to mention, was own-
ed by capitalists in the commercial portions of the
Union 0« Bed generally by those who preferred
the security of the Government at even a moderate
rate oí interest, to any pm a*e security whatsoever,
and who would have been glad that their
stock   could   have been   irredeemable  for ever
Bi t the Government had the right and the means
to redeem it, and it was redeemed accordingly
The same motive which gave a preference to
Government security, w ould naturally prefer the
next best secmity, and that security existed, or was
to be ob*imed, bj banking corporations Hence,
the redemption of the public debt, at least m the
commercial portions of the Union, by releasing the
capital wmen had been invested in it, was one of
the most efficient, I doubt not the most efficient,
cause of increasing the number and capital of
the local banks in that portion of the Union to
which I have referred
In the younger States, where capital was scarce,
othei causes have been instrumental to the same
result—the multiplication of banks, and the aug-
mentation of their capital Nor is it to be won-
dered at, that the scarcity of a circulating medium,
in the States last referred to, has been maily m
strumental m mtroducdmg to the establishment of
banks    When, we consider a well settled principle
