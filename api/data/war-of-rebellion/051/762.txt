whole engagement, added greatly to their discomfort and rendered many of their guns useless. But notwithstanding these disadvantages, they held their position firmly for more than three hours, and until put an end to the firing, when they withdrew quietly across the river without loss, partially destroying the bridge behind them. No movements were made on either side during the night.

On the next day our troops were drawn up in the intrenchments on the south side of the river to resist any attempt by the enemy to cross, but after waiting some hours they burned the village of Wyatt and retired without making any effort to follow us. A small force was sent to watch their movements, but both men and horses were too much exhausted to make any pursuit in force practicable.

Our loss at Wyatt was 9 killed and 28 wounded. The enemy admit theirs to have been 6 killed and 20 wounded. One prisoner (Captain Hodgman, of the Seventh Kansas), who was wounded, has since died.

A force of five regiments of infantry and some artillery, under the command of Colonel Sweeny, which left La Grange on the 11th, came as far as Chulahoma with the intention of cutting off our retreat to Wyatt, but finding that we had passed returned from that place. Both the infantry and cavalry commands of the enemy were guilty of many outrages in the destruction of houses and other private property, and, in some instances, in acts of robbery and cruel personal violence toward infirm and defenseless citizens.

The conduct of the officers and men of my command, with a few exceptions, was worthy of much praise. A part of them had just before been armed with long-range guns. It was the first time they had been able to meet the enemy on anything like equal terms, and their conduct gives evidence of what might be expected if the remainder of the command was as well equipped.

The lists of the killed and wounded in the different engagements and the reports of subordinate commanders, including Colonel Richardson's report of the affair near New Albany on the 5th, are herewith forwarded.

I have the honor to remain, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES R. CHALMERS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Colonel B. S. EWELL, Assistant Adjutant-General.
