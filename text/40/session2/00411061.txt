it drawn out of the country to tho amount of
$100,000,000 per year? 1 think not.
OUR FOREIGN DEBT AND IMPORTS.
But this is not all. We are in debt, and our
obligations are largely held abroad, upon which
we are paying interest in gold. This foreign
debt consists chiefly of five-twenty Government
bonds, supposed to amount to $600,000,000,
and State, city, railroad, and other bonds,
at least $200,000,000 more, making in all
$800,000,000. Upon these we pay an annual in-
terest amounting to $48,000,000 in gold. Now,
with this drain of interest and $100,000,000 as
the balance of trade how can we adopt specie
payment with any reasonable hope of being
able to sustain it? It is not possible. We must
change the form of our public debt and call
home the bonds now in the hands of foreigners
and place them in the hands of our own people.
We must revise our tariff, and, if possible, stop
this immense importation of foreign goods. Let
me give a few items, which I find convenient,
in Mr. Delmar's report for November, 1807.
During the months of June, July, August, and
September last we imported, among other
things, the following:
Cotton, good in value  $5,990,229
Flax, good in value  4,731,337
Woolon. good m value  IS,048,065
Iron and steel, good in value  9,398,333
Sugar and molasses, in value  18,082,742
Total for four months S50.850.708
Here are imports amounting in four months,
one third of a year, to over fifty-six million
dollars, every dollar's worth of which could
and should be produced in our own country,
and thereby save the money paid abroad for
them to enrich our circulation and to give
employment to thousands of our citizens in
converting raw materials into valuable fabrics
needed for home consumption, and opening a
home market larger and better for our agricul-
tural products than all the outside world has
ever afforded us.
WE MUST ENCOURAGE HOME PRODUCTION.
Wc have the raw cotton; we have the flax
or the means of producing it; wc have moun-
tains of iron and coal inexhaustible, and we
have the soil for the sugar-cane, the beet, and
the sorghum.
Why not employ the means proper to put all
these unbounded resources into practical de-
velopment, and thereby not only supply our own
warns but fill the markets of the world with
tliem, and reverse the tide of trade and turn the
stream of gold into our country, instead of out
of it, as is now done?
Let no one say it cannot be done. We can
do it if we will, and when our people wake up
to a realizing sense of the importance of this
matter they will act, and the sooner the better.
We imported ninety million pounds of wool
last year, worth $25,000,000 in gold. Do
farmers think wool cannot be raised in our
country? 1 hope not. We raise the finest
wool and have the greatest possible facility for
its production of any other country. Vermont
sheep took the premium in the World's Fair.
Why send abroad for $25,000,000 worth of
wool? Let the intelligent farmers of the West
answer.
THE WOOL TARIFF OF 1867.
We made a small wool tariff last year, and
it cut off the immense import of coarse wool
from South America. A little more of the
same legislation and wool growing will become
a paying interest in our country.
Sir, the cotton, flax, wool, iron and steel,
raw and manufactured, and the sugar and mo-
lasses that we will buy abroad this year (taking
the first four months already passed for a cri-
terion) will amount to $170,000,000, to be paid
for every dollar in gold, and yet full eighty per
cent, of that sum (3130,000,000) is simply
bread and meat. If a bolt of muslin or a yard
of broadcloth costs five dollars, four of those
five dollars are for the food consumed m the
production ; if a ton of iron or 'Steel costs
ยง100, eighty dollars of the price are to pay
for the food consumed by the labor that pro-
duced it; if a hogshead of sugar costs $200,
$160 are for food. Here, where we enjoy a
monopoly in the production of bread and
meat and can develop our resources so as to
feed the whole world, yet wo ignore the fact,
and send our gold abroad to buy that, very
food, and then, to excuse our folly, complain
that we have no market for our agricultural
productions.
BAD EFFECT OF \ P.AD POLICY.
We must get out of this highway to ruin.
We must diversify our labor and so arrange it
as that we may be self-sustaining and self-sup-
porting. England buys our raw cotton for fif-
teen cents a pound and pays for it in goods,
and returns it to us manufactured, and sells it
for fifty cents in gold. The old saying is but too
true : " We sell a sheep-skin for sixpence and
buy back the tail for a shilling." Any country
will be impoverished that sells continuously its
productions in a raw state ; the profit all goes
to the manufacturer, who improves the value.
I'armers know well the truth of this and pre-
fer, where they have the means to do so, to
sell nothing until the last possible improve-
ment is put upon it to increase its \alue. Let
us, at least, learn in the school of experience,
and at the earliest moment possible correct the
errors of the past by adopting a wiser policy.
SPtOlE PAVMENT CONSIDERED.
Gentlemen talk of withdrawing our paper
money and adopting specie payment as though
it needed only to be commenced and forth it
will come. Have they taken the pains to con-
sider how much money is necessary to carry
on, with reasonable facility, the internal com-
merce of this extensive country? In 18G0,
when our population was several millions less
than at present, when we had no great national
debt, when the balance of our foreign trade was
largely in our favor, and when our marketable
productions for the home trade were not two
thirds the quantity nor of half tho value they
are now, our currency then amounted to about
five hundred million dollars, of which about
two thirds were coin :
Coin 3287,325,493
Paper  202,005,/b/
Totnl   2 ISO,331,260
Did we complain then of what Secretary
McCulloch delights to call a plethora of money?
Not so ; even then the volume of money was
inadequate to the business wants of the coun-
try, and much of the internal traffic had to be
carried on with the credit system. Now that
our population is one fifth more than in 1860,
or nearly forty millions, and our annual pro-
ductions neai ly double, and our people spread-
ing out into new States and Territories in the
great West with an activity and enterprise never
equaled before in this or any other country,
can it be possible that we should be sufficiently
supplied with currency at the estimate of the
Secretary of the Treasury and those who back
him in opinion by being allowed $250,000,000
as a circulating medium? Just moving back-
wards instead of forwards: instead of giving
half the amount of money employed in 18C0
we should have double that quantity.
AMOUNT OF MONEY IN 1865.
Up to 1865 no complaint was made by any
respectable portion of the people, in public or
private position about the plethora of the cur-
rency ; perhaps while the war was upon us
there was but little opportunity, even for croak-
ers, to sound the alarm. What was our circu-
lation that year? Seethe Secretary's report
for 1867, and you will be able to discover that
it amounted to over nine hundred million dol-
lars, besides the seven-thirty notes, which en-
tered largely into the circulation. Here are
the figures:
Tive per cent, notes  S>3.951,230
Compound-inteiest notes   217.02U60
i Greenbacks and h-aetional currency  459.59),311
I National bank notes  197,279,298
| 907,762,999
! Add seven-thirty notes   830,000,000
$1,737,762,999
So much for the volume of currency on the
1st September, 18G5. Then our wise financial
minister began to disturb tho waters ; then it
was he fell in love with tho idea of specie pay-
ments ; and then began our troubles in money
matters that have borne us down to the earth,
and from which our people are struggling to
escape. But the Secretary persists,in fastening
the burden upon them irrevocably. Hear what
he says in his report of 1867 :
"Since the 1st day of September, 1865. the tem-
porary loaus, the certificates of indebtedness, and
the five iter cent, notes have all been paid, the
compound-interest notes have been reduced from
$217,021,100 to $71,875,040; the seven-thirty notes
from $830,000,000 to ยฃ337,978,800; tile United States
notes, (ereenbaeks,) including fractional currency,
from ยง459,505,311 to 8387,871,477. while tho cash in
the Treasury has been increased lrom $88,218,055 to
$133,998,398."
Take the Secretary at his word, and see how
much he has reduced our circulation in about
two years ; he admits that these several items,
which he has paid in part or in toto, "were in
circulation as money."
CIRCULATION REDUCED IN TWO YEARS.
Five per cent, notes   $33,954,230
Compound-interest notes 145,149,120
Greenbacks  71,633,834
Money locked up  45,780,343
296,517,527
Add reduced seven-thirty notes - 492,021,200
Total reduction $788,538,727
Nearly three hundred millions of this reduc-
tion was money to all intents and purposes, so
made and so used : and the seven-thirty notes
used as such to a very great extent. Not only
so ; we sent to Europe as the balance of trade
against us during those two years gold and
silver coin, namely:
In 1866  882,643,374
In 1867   55,116,381
8137,759,758
And, to cap the climax in this work of op-
pression, the collection of internal revenue
during those two years exceeded six hundred
million dollars. Is it any wonder, with this
statement of facts that is taken from authentic
sources, that the people feel deeply the burdens
that they are carrying; burdens made doubly
onerous by the unwise and unnecessary contrac-
tion of the currency by the Secretary, made in
open opposition to the public will, and in utter
recklessness as to the hardships he was impos-
ing upon the people.
LITTLE MONEY AND MUCH CREDIT.
One of the great drawbacks in this country,
and more especially of the western States, has
resulted from a want of money. Those States
have never had enough of currency to enable
the people to carry on the business to the ex-
tent of their enterprise and as the vast unde-
veloped resources of the country justify. The
rapid growth of the West has been accom-
plished under great embarrassment from the
scarcity of money. 'This want has been sup-
plied, in a measure, at great inconvenience
and cost, by the credit system. Goods were
bought and sold on credit, labor was per-
formed on credit, everything was credit, and
the whole country was filled with promissory
notes, and mortgages were spread over the
land for millions upon millions of dollars,
bearing interest at ruinous rates. The war,
which biought so many calamities upon the
country, brought with it a tide of currency to
the West such as the people never enjoyed be-
fore ; and never did a people make better use
of the blessing than they have done. In the
brief time allowed them they moved forward
with industry and perseverance, and filled the
market, with their products, for which they
received remunerating prices, and were paid at
sight in moneyโnational moneyโmoney that
paid debts, paid taxes, bought land, and that
would not spoil if laid safely away for future
use. Then we had a thousand million dollars
distributed through the country as a currency,
and the West had its share, iiut Mr. McCul-
loch has dried up the source of our good for-
tune, and now, to gratify him in his caprice,
