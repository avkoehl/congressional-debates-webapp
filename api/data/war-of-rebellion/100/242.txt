HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, S. C., April 17, 1865 - 1 p. m.

(received 10. 15 a. m. 19th.)

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Goldsborough:

As soon as the expedition from Sumterville retuns I would like to strike for Augusta, Ga. I believe I could get together a sufficient force for that purpose without more troops, but to make the thing certain and complete I should have 2,000 or 3,000 more men and some cavalry. The small squad of cavalry which I have is all ordered to City Point. It occurs to me that you may now be in condition to spare the 4,000 troops sent to North Carolina from my command, otr a portion of them. If you cannot give me any more men I am disposed to try it with what I have, and await your instructions and authority to go in person, if I deem it best.

I made arrangements for him, Governor Anderson, Mr. Garrison, and party consisting of seventeem, to come up in the Suwo Nada, which was agreeable to all. I shall leave here for Washington in City of Hudson at 5 o'clock.
