Public Defaulters—Mr. Duncan.
Ho. of Reps.
Again: when General Jackson was President,
the Federalists said Martin Van Buren adminis-
tered the Government. Jackson's messages were
splendid documents in point of talent; they could
not be surpassed All the objections the Federal-
ists had to them consisted in their hostility to the
Democratic doctrines they contained, but they said
General Jackson neither composed nor wrote them,
they were Martin Van Buren's messages But
now that Martin Van Buren ls^President, every
leading measure and proposition of the Adminis-
tration comes fiom the Hermitage Sir, I repeat
the question again. What confidence is to be placed
m a party who change their name and their prin-
ciples with the íeturn of every election'
But, sir, I have presented this anay of Federal
inconsistencies, not meiely for the purpose of ex-
posing the base practice of changing names and
principles for the unhallowed purposes of political
deception, but also to prove what I have already
stated, and what has been well known in reference
to the principles of the Federal party; which is,
that it is a part of their faith, and a fundamental
principle of their doctrine, that the common people
have not the intelligence, firmness, and moral in-
tegrity necessary for self-government, and all these
changes of names, and professed changes of prin-
ciples, is base arid black hypocrisy.
Sir, we have had a prophetic destruction flora
the gentleman from Mississippi, [Mr Prfntiss,]
as blighting as that pronounced by the inspired
prophets against Babylon He has told us, in
substance, thit if this Administration is to be con-
tinued, this Government must fall.youi Constitu-
tion will be rent, and scattered to the foui winds
This would be bad Your fiee institutions will
be prostrated and leveled with the earth. This
would be woise This magnificent pile of noble
architecture will tottei, tumble, crumble, and min-
gle with the dust of the pyramids of Egypt, the
temples of Greece, and the obelisks of Rome'
Hardly a scratch or scioll will be found upon the
lofty columns that now sunound us to give name
to this magnificent temple of liberty to the curious
and romantic wanderer in after ages ' All this is
withering prophe-y to the philanthropist and the
Inter of liberty, but the worst is yet to come, that
which will be far more distiessing to the lover of
science, literature, and politics The gentleman
concluded his prophecy by the chilling threat,
that if Martin Van Buren is again to be elected
President of these United States, he (the gentle-
man) will do—what, sir? Take the Great West-
el n, and go to Liverpool' Yes, sir, the gentleman
will expatriate himself fiom this Government
What a calamity ' It will be the footing up of
all the other calamities that await this people and
this Government, if this wicked Admunstiation is
to be continued
Í think the Democracy, sn, will have to take
this last threatened calamity seuously into con-
sideration When I go home, I will lay the mat-
ter, in a pioper manner, before the fitst Demó-
crata convention which may be held in the distuct
I have the honor to represent I will also consult
gome of my old and well tried friends in Democ-
racy Father Felter and Father Dawson aie pa
trtarrhs m Democracy They are expenenced in
political matters They aiedoctors in Democracy,
and, withal, sound, pure, and upright patriots at
heart Their opinions on th s important ques-
tion will be of great weight I think the Democ-
racy, so far as my district is concerned, will take
such oider on the question as will operate to the
best interests of the country Should I have the
honor of a seat in the next netioual convention
which will be held for the presidential nomina-
tions of 1840, I will lay the matter before the con-
vention, and if it shall be thought that the los  of
the gentleman as a cittz n of the United S ates
will be an injury paramount to the benefits of Mr
Van Buren s administration, why, Mr Van Bu-
ren " then, and n that case," will be withdrawn,
and some less dangerous man shall be taken up
in hit, place I know that the Democracy will do
«hit is right in 1'ie premises Bat, si , I hope,
if t e gentleman <-houkl expatriate mmself, and
" ta\e the Great Western for Liverp >ol,51 still it
may not pro\e ti e final end of th.s Govei iment
W len Alexander ti e Gifst planted the Grecian
standard in the soil of India, and was carrying
his conquests into the interior theieof, and one
victory seemed to be gained to the glory of the
Grecian arms but to give way for another equally
glorious, m all these battles Alexander was found
in the front ranks. (A most happy admonition
to some of our livened gentlemen, who had bet-
ter be in Florida, or at some other post where
they would be doing more service to their coun-
try, than hanging and lounging about the city of
Washington, each occupying the room of two at
all your balls, routs, and assemblies, wheie, in
some instances, theie is notning but women to
fight ) Some of his officers, m tne most friendly
manner, admonished the King of the danger he
was usking in thus exposing his royal person,
and the great interest that Greece had in the pres-
et vation of his lite The King answered that
the welfare of Greece did not depend on the life
or death of one man. So i would hope, sir, that
the duration and welfare of this Republic does not
depend on the piesence or absence, or life or
death, of any one man. But this Republic may
fall, yes, sir, it will fall, as did the Assyrian em-
pire, when the Medes were governed by a mule,
and from the same cause Cicesus, King of As-
syna, consulted the oracle Delphos, for purposes
that related to his futuie piospenty, and the pros-
perity of his empne He was told that when he
crossed the river Ilalys, that a gieat empire would
be destroyed, and that when the Medes should be
governed by a mule, he would be m dangei lie
never dieamed that it was to be his own empire
that was to be destroyed when he should cross
the river Halys, and he thought the tl mg impos
sible that evei the Medes should be ruled by a
mule But after his empire was destroyed, and
he made prisoner by Cyrus, King of Persia, he
sent a gold chain, with a reprimand, to the Del-
phic otacle for so deceiving him, he wasinfoimed
by the oracle that it was his own empire it was
meant should be destroyed, when he should pass
the river Halys, and that Cyrus was the mule
who was to govern the Medes—a mule being a
mongrel beast, half ass and half horse And that
Cyrus, being the son of Cambyses, King of Per
sm, and Mandams, daughter of Astyages, King
of the Medes, he was of mongrel composition—
one half of his blood Persian, by his father, and
the other that of the Medes, by his mother So,
sir, when this Republic comes to be governed by
a mule, (Federal sway,) it will fall, or it will be
subvened Sir, what is the Federal party? A
mongrel composition consisting of part Bank and
part Anti-Bank, Masonic and Anti-Masonic, Ab-
oliuon and Arm Abolition, &c , &c Made up,
sir, of the factions and fractions, and odds and
ends of all factions, bound together by no com
mon print íple or tie but natmal and unrelenting
hostility to the Demociatic party, and the Demo
cratic punciples When the day shall come that
this mule shall govern this country and this peo
pie, then will our Repuohc fall, and our fiee in-
stitutions cruml le to the ground, and mingle with
the dust of the fiee institutions of other Republics
which have fallen by the misrule of snrnlai fac-
tions and ambitious demagogues.
Sir, as an evidence that this coirupt Adminis-
tration is soon to be overthrown, the gentleman
has piesented us, in glowing colors, the recent
Fedeial victories m New \oik And the gentle-
man attempted to amuse us with the effect that that
Federal triumph must have had upon the Presi
dent It is true that the State of New York has
given, at the recent election, a Federal vote by a
small majority, much smaller than it was the pie-
ced tng election And 1 have no doubt but that
the Tedeial success last fall was the necessary re-
sult to secure Democratic success to the next pres-
idential election Yes,sir, the ten thousand tricks,
stratagems, and base frauds, which were used to
deceive the Democracy, and to secure Federal suc-
cess, will recoil with ten fold force upon the heads
of tneworkersof such base m.quities, and, besides,
a defeatsomething like that of NewTcork was ne-
cessary to keep up that Democratic watchft Iness,
so indispensable to the preservation of our free
institutions. With the rushing torient of political
prosnenty, which was the lo' of me Demociacy
las' fal', there was dangti of falling into careless-
ness and RDathy, from wmch we could only ha.\e
been roused by some great vk lation of our political
righ's, such as occurred in 1824, when the people
by fiaud, corruption, and bargain, we*e cheated
out of the man of their choice for the first office m
their gift But, sir, the Federal success in New
York, and the manner by which such a result was
brought about, will keep up a laudable and whole-
some Democratic excitement, which will not be
limited to that State, but will influence more or less
the Democracy throughout the Union, and will tell
a woeful tale for Federalism in 1840
While I am on this subject, it will not be im-
proper to notice some curious circumstances of a
national character which seem, if not to partake
of the supervision of which I have been speaking,
at least to have all the characteristics of retributive
justice. I allude, sir, to the rejection of the dis-
tinguished and talented statesman and accom-
plished gentleman who now fills the executive
chair of these United States, It will be jemem-
bered that during the late Administration, Geneial
Jackson nominated, in the recess of Congress,
Martin Van Buren Murrster to the Court of St.
James. The Senate of the United States—havmg
a majority at that time opposed to the Administra-
tion and the Democratic party, but since reformed
by the penple—rejected the nomination, and Mr.
Van Buren was of course called home What
followed' Why, the people, the freemen of the
country, elected him vice president of the United
States, elected him to thesecond office within their
gift, placed him in that same Senate, to preside
ovei the same men who, foi party purposes, nar-
row party considerations, had rejected him What
a triumph of principle and of retubutive justice '
But the laudable and popular indignation tor such
base injustice did not stop there Popular love
and popular confidence, which he had honestly
earned, gave him the highest station within the
gift of the American people—a station which he is
now filling with honor to himself, dignity to his
office, and to the highest and best interests of hia
country
There is another little matter, of the same char-
acter, whiUi I will just mention
It will be remembered that General Jackson
nominated one Ben Tappan to the office of district
judge of the State of Ohio—as sound a Democrat
and as pme a patnot as ever honored the names;
and, withal, of the first older of talents, and of the
most unexceptionable deportment This nomin-
ation, for paity purposes, contracted, groveling,
selfish considerations, and foi the gratification of
a vindictiveness which can be found in no party
except the sworn enemies of Democracy, was
rejected But what do you think the people have
done, sir' They have placed this same Ben Tap-
pan in the seat of him by whose vote the nomina-
tion was rejected, and have consigned him (Ewmg)
who voted the rejection to peipetual and eveilast-
ing " solitude and the desert wastes r>J water " These
things may not have been biought about by any
piovidential interposition, but they evidently par-
take of that kind of i etnbutive justice which is one
of the attributes of Providence
I hate said that the gentleman from Mississippi
[Mr Pflntiss] biought forward the alarm of
Belshazzar to portray the alarm of the Pre-id en t
on hearing of the defeat of the Democracy of New
York 1 thank the gentleman for the classical
allusion I will tiy to make something of it for
my purpose
Sir, the conduct of the Federalists in 1837, on
the reception of the news of their victories in several
of the States, will well bear comparison wnh that
of Senachenb, and many other tyrants of his
time, who were mere scourges in the hand of the
Almighty to punish the wickedness and idolatry
of mankind In speaking of the sway of his power
and of his conquests, he said
" By the strength of my hand I have done it,
'and by my wisdom, for I am prudent, and I
' have i emoved the bounds of the people, and have
' robbed them of their treasmes, and have put down
' the inhabitants like a vain nt man, and my hand
' hath found as a nest tne riches of the people, and
' as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gath-
' ered all the earth, and there was none that moved
1 the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped "
But this monarch, so ai'gustand wise in his own
eye, how did he appear in that of the Almighty '
Only as a subaltern—a servant sent by his n as
ter—the rod of his anger, and the staT 11 his hand
The Almighty's design was to chastise his child i en,
not to exterminate them, but Senacherib had it
