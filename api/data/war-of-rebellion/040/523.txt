May 25, 1863.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

General Scammon desires the telegraph extended from Fayette to Princeton, in Western Virginia; distance, 75 miles. Our lines in that direction have been repeatedly captured or destroyed, and it is doubtful whether they can be protected. I therefore desire your authority before commencing the work.

Respectfully, yours,

A. STAGER,

Superintendent U. S. Military Telegraphs.

WASHINGTON, D. C.,

Major-General HOOKER,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

No Confederate officers will be paroled or exchanged until further orders. They will be kept in close confinement and strongly guarded. Those already paroled will be confined.

Major-General DIX,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

Have you it in your power to obtain reliable information of the transfer of troops from Charleston to Richmond? From recent indications it is of great importance that this fact should be ascertained as early as practicable.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.

May 25, 1863-3 p. m.

Major-General HOOKER:

I am informed from three different sources, and do not doubt, that troops have gone from South Carolina and Georgia, but whether to Bragg or Lee not quite certain. The greater part of Longstreet's forces, recently on the Blackwater, are near Richmond, ready to move either on Fredericksburg or West Point.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON,

Major-General HOOKER:

Have you received a letter from me, dated on Friday?

S. P. CHASE.
