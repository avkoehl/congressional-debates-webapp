HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA,Raleigh, April 6, 1865.

Brigadier General L. S. BAKER,

Weldon, N. C.:

GENERAL: The commanding general directs me to inform you that from sources not doubled, though not official, we learn here that after severe fighting on Sunday last before Richmond (on our right) the enemy succeeded in breaking our lines and forcing us to uncover the capital. The immediate evacuation of the city by us followed. Particulars are not yet know here. The President and cabinet are in Danville. Unless you have a larger force than the general is advised of it would be useless to bestow further attention upon defensive works at Weldon, in the absence of direct instructions from General Lee. Unless, therefore, you should receive instructions from him to the contrary, or should have special reasons not knonw here, youhad better at once send this way all movable Government sores, property, and material, and your negroe force, and hold yourself promptly prepared to wihdraw and save your forces as soon as you shall find them placed in jeopardy by the approach of the enemy from any direction. Of course you will not move your forces until the necessity becomes apparent. Keep a vigilant lookout toward eery threatening quarter. All rolling-stock and railroad material must be saved. I inclose you two slips* from the press. Rumors say General Lee is between Richmond and Danville, but we have no information on the subject.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN B. SALE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
