CUMBERLAND GAP, September 8, 1863.

General POTTER:

I am engaged here; have not a man to spare. General Shackelford is on the Tennessee and has communicated with me. If I had more ammunition I should be certain of entering the gap this evening or to-morrow by capitulation. If the enemy did not get away last night I think he must surrender soon, as I hope to be round him on this side before 9 a.m.
