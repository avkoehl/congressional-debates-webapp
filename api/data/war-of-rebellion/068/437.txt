WILDERNESS TAVERN,

May 6, 1864-11.30 a.m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.,:

We have been engaged with the enemy in full force since early yesterday. So far there is no decisive result, but I think all things are progressing favorably. Our loss to this time I do not think exceeds 8,000 of whom a large proportion are slightly wounded. Brigadier-General Hays was killed yesterday, and Generals Getty and Bartlett wounded. We have taken about 1,400 prisoners. Longstreet's, A. P. Hill's and Ewell's corps are all represented among the prisoners taken.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
