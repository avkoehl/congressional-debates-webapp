ing to the size of the mails, the speed with which
they are conveyed, and the importance of the ser-
vice; and it shall be lawful l'or him to contract lor
conveying the mail with any such railroad company,
either with or without advertising tor such contract:
Provided, That for tile conveyance of the mail on
any railroad ot the first class ho shall not pay a
higher rate of compent-ation than is novr allowed by
law ; nor for carrying the mail on any railroad of the
second class a greater compensation than S10U per
mile per annum; nor for carrying the mail on any
railroad of the third class a greater compensation
than fifty dollars per mile per annum. And in case
the Postmaster General shall not bo able to conclude
a. contract for carrying the mail on any such railroad
routes at a compensation not exeeedini?the aforesaid
maximum rates, or for what he may deem a reason-
able and fair compensation for the service to be per-
formed, it shall be lawful for him to_ soparate the
letter mail from the residue of the mail, and to con-
tract, c'.ther with or without advertising for convey-
ing the letter mail over such route by horse express,
or otherwise, a.t the frreatest, speed that can reason-
ably be obtained, and also to contract for carrying
over such route the residue of the mail, in wagons
or otherwise, at a slower rate of speed: Provided,
That if one half of the service on any railroad is
required to be performed in the night, season it shall
be lawful for the Postmaster General to pay twenty-
five per cent, in addition to the aforesaid maximum
rales of allowance: And provided further. That if it
shall bo found necessary to convey over any railroad
route more than two mails daily it shall be lawful
for the Postmaster General to nay such additional
compensation as he may think just and reasonable,
having reference to the service performed and the
maximum rate of allowance established by this act."
In order to such an arrangement and classi-
fication of railroad routes as the act last men-
tioned contemplates there is an obvious neces-
sity for accurate and reliable information as to
the "size of the mails" they severally con vey.
Yet, until recently, no measures were ever
taken t,o procure from any considerable pro-
portion of the roads in the service of the De-
partment statements of the amounts of mail
matter conveyed by them, respectively. In
February and March last, however, a "rail-
road weight circular " was issued and addressed
to the proprietors of each railroad route, re-
questing them to '' weigh all the through mails
and way mails" conveyed in both directions to
and from every station for thirty consecutive
working days, commencing on all roads east of
the Rocky mountains on the 1st, and on all
roads west on the 15th of April, 1867, and
report the results to the Department in a pre-
scribed tabular form annexed to the circular,
and to return also a description of the accom-
modations provided for mails and agents, with
the dimensions, fixtures, and furniture of the
car or apartment allotted to their use, and a
statement of the number of trips per week in
each direction. Prompt responses were re-
turned from a majority of the routes; and to
obtain returns from the residue a second cir-
cular was issued, under date of the 1st August,
1867, notifying them that the returns received
would be published, and remarking that roads
refusing or failing to respond would incur the
imputation of unwillingness to exhibit the
amount and character of the service they per-
formed for the Department in comparison with
others receiving equal compensation, and that,
upon any future call or opportunity for the
readjustment of the pay for transporting mails
on such roads, the information asked for would
be deemed indispensable. The result of these
calls appears in the annexed "table showing
the weight of mails and accommodations for
mails and agents on railroad routes, with the
frequency of the service and the rate of pay per
mile per annum for mail transportation," in
which, it will be observed, the routes are
arranged, not by States, but according to the
rate of pay, the highest being first, and those
of equal pay according to the average weight
carried the whole distance.
Two routes receiving the highest rate of
pay—$37-5 per mile per annum—have reported,
namely, the New Jersey railroad, route 2006,
between New York and New Brunswick, on
which the average weight of mails per day car-
ried the whole length of the route is 20,119
pounds, and the Philadelphia and Trenton
railroad, route 2007, between New Brunswick
and Philadelphia, on which the average weight
of mails per day carried the whole length of
the route is 20,009 pounds. On four routes
receiving pay at. the rate of $800 per mile the
daily average weights range from 22,581 pounds
between Baltimore and Washington, (route
3207,) to 7,068 pounds between Baltimore and
Cumberland, (route 3203,) both under contract
to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company.
On eight routes receiving pa.v at rates ranging
from $275 to $210 87 per mile the weights
range from 9.385 pounds per day between
Cincinnati and Xenia, (Little Miami railroad,

weights range from 10,183 pounds per day
between Philadelphia and Pittsburg, (Penn-
sylvania railroad, route 2201,) to 3(37 pounds
between Syracuse and Rochester, (New York
Central railroad, route 1234.) Dividing the
Pennsylvania railroad at'IIarrisburg, the point
at which the great mails between New York
and the principal cities of the West, pass on
and off that road, the average weight per day
carried the whole distance between Philadel-
phia and Harrihburg is 8,278 pounds, and
between Harrisburg and Pittsburg 23,825
pounds, the largest average reported. On six
routes receiving pay at rates ranging from
S187 50 to $150 72 the weights range from
4,827 pounds between Boston and Providence,

and Boonsboro', (Chicago and Northwestern
railroad, route 11-103, pay $175.) On twenty-
seven routes receiving $150 the weights range
from 7,384 pounds between Rochester and
Niagara Falls, (New York Central railroad,
route 1282.) to 287 pounds between Leaven-
worth and Lawrence, (Union Pacific railroad,
route 14,083, branch.)
On twenty routes receiving pay at rates
ranging from $145 G4 to $103 63 the weights
range from 3,003 pounds between Richmond
and Petersburg, (Richmond and Petersburg
railroad, route 4408, pay $122 45,) to 30
pounds between Rouse's Point and Canada
line, (Champlain and St. Lawrence railroad,
route 1138, pay $116 60.) On sevenly-one
routes receiving $100 the weights range from
7,086 pounds between Washinglon aud Lynch-
burg, (Orange and Alexandria railroad, route
4401,) to six pounds between Shawmut and
Shawmut Junction, (PennsylvaniaCanuel Coal
railroad, route 2830.) On six routes receiv-
ing pay at rates ranging from $90 to $77 17
the weights range from 732 pounds between
Albany and Junction, (Rensselaer and Sara-
toga railroad, route 1080, pay $85 75.) to 108
pounds between Canandaigua and Batavia,
(New York Central railroad, route 1277, pay
$83 ) On fifry-one routes receving $75 the
weights range from 2,048 pounds between At-
lanta and West Point, (Atlanta and West
Point railroad, route 0003,) to 40 pounds
between Northboro' and Pratt's station, (Agri-
cultural Branch railroad, route 640a.) On
twelve routes receiving pay at rates ranging
from $09 09 to $51 12 the weights range from
1,324 pounds between Buffalo and Corning,
(Brie railroad, route 1321, pay $00,) or 3,7!J4
pounds dividing the route at Attica, to 46
pounds between Taunton and Middleboro',
(Middleboro' and Taunton railroad, route 079,
pay $03 16.) On one hundred and eight routes
receiving $50 the weights range from 6,488
pounds between Suspension Bridge and De-
troit, (Great Western railroad of Canada, route
1320,) to 12 pounds between Washington and
Double Wells, (Georgia railroad, route 6005.)
On thirty-one routes receiving pay at rates
ranging from $47 77 to $2U the weights range
from 464 pounds between Lancaster and Mid-
dletown, (Pennsylvania railroad, route 2257,
pay $45 84,) to 14 pounds between Hodges
and Abbeville, (Greenville and Columbia rail-
road, route 5,607 branch, pay $30.)

Not the weight of the mails alone, it is true,
but also the accommodations provided for the
mails and agents of the Department, the dimen-
sions, fixtures, and furniture ot the carorapart-
ment allotted to their use, the frequency of the
service, and, it may be, other circumstances
besides, are entitled to consideration in adjust--
ing the pay for railroad transportation. Still,
the size of the mails being, in the main, unde-
niably the principal indication or test of " the
importance of the service," the figures above
eitcd display great inequalities in the rates
actually allowed. No general systematic revis-
ion and readjustment of these rates, based upon
the returns received, has yet been attempted ;
but in a number of cases of disagreement, be-
tween the Department and railroad companies
the returns have been used as a guide to a
proper settlement of the dispute; and as the
terms of existing contracts expire, and it be-
comes necessary to enter into new engage-
ments, it is expected that such changes will
from time to time be made as will eventuate
ultimately in the nearest practicable approach
to a perfect classification of railroad routes and
graduation of their pay according to the com-
parative value and importance of the service
they perform.
The table showing the weight of mails, &e.,
above referred to, is accompanied by an alpha-
betical index for easy reference, and also by
a list of routes from which no response to the
Department's calls has been received, in which
list the titles of the companies are arranged in
alphabetical order. Several whose titles do
not appear in either the table or the list are
expected yet to furnish the desired information,
they being in correspondence with the Depart-
ment on the subject.
POST-ROUTE MAPS,
These maps, the general outline of which
was suggested by and inaugurated under the
administration of Postmaster General Blair,
are intended to embrace a systematic exhibit
of the postal service of the United States on
a plan adapted to keep up with the periodical
changes and gradual improvement of the ser-
vice.
It is needless to do more than refer to the
advantages of this graphic mode of representa-
tion for a general view of mail connections
over the tedious reference to books of entry.
Owing to the vast extent of our national
domain, and the great number of post offices
and routes to be shown, with the requisite
amount of detail, such maps can only be com-
piled in successive groups of States.
During the past year a map of the mail ser-
vice in the States of New Hampshire, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and_Conoectieut,
with parts of New York and Maine, has been
completed by the topographer, and distributed
to postmasters and otheragents or the Depart-
ment, as also to officers in other branches of
the public service, and has already secur&u
