Colonel G. W. BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

COLONEL: Nothing unusual has occurred along the line during the past twenty-four hours. General Gracie kept up such a brisk fire upon the enemy last night that they were unable to advance their sap-rollers. They again attempted to threw hand-grenades into his trenches, but without success. Brigade commanders report all work being pushed on. A great deal of lead, number of balls and shells of every description were collected yesterday. Private Reamey, Company B, Thirty-fourth Virginia Regiment, Wise's brigade, alone collected 1,567 minie-balls, 2 shot, and 2 shells.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted: Elliott's brigade, killed, 1; wounded, 11. Ransom's brigade, killed, 4 (2 carelessly); wounded, 4 (2 carelessly). Wise's brigade, wounded, 4. Gracie's brigade, killed, 2; wounded, 7. Total, 7 killed and 26 wounded.

Colonel GEORGE WILLIAM BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION, July 24, 1864.

COLONEL: The enemy have been very quiet during the past twenty-four hours. General Gracie has kept the enemy from advancing their sap-rollers. Colonel McAfee, commanding Ransom's brigade, reports that the artillery on his left opened upon a working party on the Baxter road yesterday and compelled them to cease work. Colonel Goode, commanding Wise's brigade, reports that in picket-firing he gives the enemy as good as is sent. General Gracie suggests that if he was supplied with the "Travis fire," which is prepared by Captain Travis, in Mobile, Ala., that he thinks he could destroy the enemy's sap-rollers.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted: Wise's brigade, wounded, 4. Elliott's brigade, killed, 1; wounded, 4 (1 mortally). Ransom's brigade, wounded, 4. Gracie's brigade, killed, 1. Total, 2 killed and 12 wounded.
