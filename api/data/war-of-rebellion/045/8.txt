HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY FORCES,Near Warrenton Junction, Va., June 5, 1863.

Colonel A. J. ALEXANDER,

Assistants Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps:

I have just received information, which I consider reliable, that all of the available cavalry of the Confederacy is in Culpeper Country. Stuart, the two Less, Robertson, Jenkins, and Jones are all there. Robertson came from North Carolina, Jenkins from Kanawha, and Jones from the Valley. Jones arrived at Culpeper on the 3d, after the others. Since the Chancellorsville fight, their cavalry has been very much increased from the infantry; 800 Texans

from Hood's command have been recently mounted upon horses from Richmond. My informant-a refugee from Madison County - says Stuart has 20, 000; can't tell his instructions, but thinks he is going to make a raid. Dispatch in cipher received.

JNO. BUFORD.

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,June 5, 1863.

General S. WILLIAMS:

The officer in charge of the pickets on the left of this corps reports that the enemy in front of his line below the city have withdrawn about one-half mile, and appear to have formed a new line.

The officer of the day of the corps reports that it appears that the enemy are massing their left within the last hour. They maintain their line of pickets along the river immediately in front of the town.
