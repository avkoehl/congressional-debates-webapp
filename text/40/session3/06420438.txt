THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 19,
we wanted. To that he replied that the res-
olution without the preamble was of no ac-
count. That is the way in which I understood
my colleague.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. My colleague is mis-
taken, and the Globe shows that he is mistaken.
He introduced a resolution, soon after we met,
instructing the Postmaster General to make no
further payments on this contract to Wells,
Fargo & Co. When he made that proposition
I said nothing at all, although I stood in the
aisle close to where he was. The objection
came from some other gentleman. The Globe
will show that after that, and as soon as I could
get the floor, I stated to the House that inas-
much as these charges had been made against
the Postmaster General in reference to this
matter it was the duty of the House at once
to institute an investigation. I had no reso-
lution, and the gentleman from New Hamp-
shire said that he had one. He offered a long
preamble to his resolution, and I said that 1
could not agree to the preamble because I did
not know the facts were as they were there
stated. I agreed to the resolution, but objec-
tion was made by some other gentleman.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Did I not
understand the gentleman to say that the pre-
amble being stricken out there was no use in
adopting the resolution ?
Mr. FARNSWORTII. No, sir.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I so under-
stood liim. The gentleman alludes to my pre-
venting him from offering his resolution and
allowing the gentleman from New Hampshire
[Mr. Ela] to submit a resolution on the same
subject. After having a conversation with the
gentleman from New Hampshire I was in favor
of his introducing a resolution providing for
this investigation. I thought there was a pecu-
liar propriety in his offering the resolution for
this investigation, while there was an impro-
priety in my colleague doing so.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. 1 expressly stated
to the House that I did not wish to be put
mpon the committee of investigation, and my
colleague knows it. It so appears in the
Globe.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Why, then,
does my colleague arraign me for preventing
him from getting on the committee, when he
says that he would not have gone on the com-
mittee in any event?
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I arraign him be-
cause^ he objected to my offering resolutions
for this investigation, and then assuming that
he tried to investigate and I opposed.
โข Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. For the
reasons I have stated.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. Jly colleaguaJs in-
nuendo that he did not want me to offer a reso-
lution providing for this investigation is an-
swered by the fact that I stated to the House
several times that X did not wish to be 011 the
committee. I did it in the hope that my col-
league would not object to the resolution. He
would not allow me to do it unless he could se-
lect the chairman of the committee. He knows
very well that it is a constant practice for spe-
cial committees to be appointed on motion of
a gentleman who himself declines serving upon
it, and that this leaves the Speaker free to
constitute the committee as he chooses.
And then, on motion of Mr. KELSEY, fat
five minutes to five o'clock p. m.,) the House
adjourned.

EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATION.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore laid before
the Senate a letter from the Secretary of the
Interior, communicating information in rela-
tion to the destitute condition of the Kansas
Indians and the diversion of the school fund
from the purpose of education to the purchase
of supplies to them ; which was referred to the
Committee on. Indian Affairs.
AMNESTY PROCLAMATION.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore also laid
before the Senate a message from the Presi-
dent of the United States; which was read, as
follows:
To the Senate of the United States:
Tilc resolution adopted on the 5th instant,request-
ing the President " to transmit to the Senate a copy
of any proclamation of amnesty made by him since
the last adjournment of Congress, and also to com-
municate to the Senate by what authority of law the
same was made," has been received.
I accordingly transmit herewith a copy of a proc-
lamation dated the 25th day of December last. The
authority of law by which it was made is set forth in
the proclamation itself, which expressly affirms that
it was issued ' by virtue of the power and authority
in me vested by the Constitution, and in the name
of the sovereign people of the United States." and
proclaims and declares " unconditionally, and with-
out reservation, to all and to every person who
direotly or indirectly participated in the late insur-
rection or rebellion, a full pardon and amnesty for
the offense of treason against the United States, or
of adhering to their enemies during the late civil
war, with restoration of all rights, privileges, and
immunities under the Constitution, and the laws
which have been made in pursuance thereof/'
The "Federal Constitution is understood to be, and
is regarded by the Executive, as the supreme law of
the land, 'l'he second section of article second of
that instrument provides that the President "shall
have power to grant reprieves and pardons for
offenses against the United States, except in cases of
impeachment." The proclamation of the 2oth ult-
imo is in stiict accordance with the judicial exposi-
ti ons of the authority thus conferred upon the Exec-
utive, and, as will be seen by reference to the accom-
panying papers, is in conformity with the precedent
established by Washington in 1795, and followed by
Presidents Adams in 1800, Madison in 1815, and Lin-
coln in 18C3, yrtid by the present Executive in 1865,
1867, and 18a
ANDREW JOHNSON.
Washington, D. C., January IS, 1869.
Mr. yFERRY. It will be unnecessary, I
aresutpe, to read the accompanying papers;
A snter submitting a few remarks upon this
manage I shall move its reference to the Judi-
ciary Committee, with the accompanying papers,
and that it be printed.
I regret, sir, that in answer to the resolution
of inquiry which I introduced some days since
the President has seen fit to make no definite
reply. The resolution, as will be seen by the
paper which has just been read, requested the
President to transmit to the Senate a copy of
any proclamation of amnesty, and to communi-
cate to the Senate by what authority of law
the same was made. He was as'ied by what
authority of law he had attempted to proclaim
amnesty in the proclamation referred to. He
has informed us by what authority of law he
undertook to declare a pardon, but has given
us no information as to the authority of law
upon which his proclamation of amnesty rests.
The difference between pardon and amnesty
is well known and familiar, and is, perhaps, as
succinctly expressed in the law dictionary of
Mr. Bouvier, under the title "amnesty/'' as
any where else. It is as follows:
"Amnesty. An act of oblivion of past offenses,
granted by the Government to those who have been
guilty of any neglect or crime, usually upon condition
that they return to their duty with in acertainpenod."
* ii. *
"3. Amnesty and pardon are very different. The
former is an act of the sovereign power, tbe object of
which is to efface and to cause to be forgotten a crime
or misdemeanor; the latter is aji act of the same
authority, which exempts the individual on whom it
U bestowed from the punishment the law inflicts for
the ciime lie has committed. (7 Pet,. 1G0.) Amnesty
is the oblivion and forgetfulness of the offense; par-
don is forgiveness. A pardon is given to one who Is
certainly guilty or has been convicted; amnesty, to
those who may have been so.
