THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 15,
men there who sympathized with the rebellion,
whose hearts were set on rebeliiou, but who
did not take any active part in the rebellion.
Now, admitting that their hearts were .^etupon
rebellion, how much more would it take to
make rebels of them?
Mr. POLAND. 1 do not think the gentle-
man and myself will differ about that. 1 stated
the other day here in the House that I was as
willing to vote for tire man who fought for the
rebellion as for the man who prayed for it.
But the difficulty is that when you undertake
to throw out the vote of a county or a town-
ship upon the estimate of somebody as to the
number of persons there who entertain bad
opinions, every man will estimate that number
according to the number who vote with him or
against him. That is the great difficulty of
going into the consciences of men and taking
their standard of belief as the test of their right
to vote. That is the practical evil of such a sys-
tem. I do not say that the Legislature of a State
may not say that a man shall not vole because
he entertains improper or erroneous opinions
upon any subject. But I say that practically,
when you come to the case of a contest between
representative raen of different parties, and to
the question of who are entitled and who are
not entitled to vote in a township or county, if
you undertake to decide that question upon
the basis of men's consciences and opinions,
that estimate will be made just as the exigen-
cies of party require.
Mr. LOAN". The contestant in this ca-e has
made his estimate, and it is upon the record
of this case as evidence. Will the gentleman
place that estimate before the House ?
Mr. POLAND. The gentleman is satisfied
with it?
Mr. LOAN. Yes, sir.
Mr. POLAND. 1 say this: the estimate of
the number of persons in that, whole county
who sympathized with the rebellion, as really
put in evidence, is wholly upon the part of the
sitting member. According to the opinion of
this witness a very large majority were of that
class. He does not leave more than two hun-
dred and fifty or two hundred and eighty per-
sons who entertained such proper and loyal
sentiments as would entitle them to be voters.
Now, as 1 have said, and I have undertaken
to give some reason for it, that species of evi-
dence is entirely unreliable ; no sort of depend-
ence can be placed upon it. The Committee
of Elections upon this subject have undertaken
to mete out equal and exact justice. There
was one case before them previous to this,
which was decided by the House—the case of
Birch vs. Van Horn of Missouri. Between
twenty five hundred and three thousand per-
sons voted for Birch, more than enough to
give him the election. And he had plenty of
witnesses who were ready to swear that in their
opinion those persons did not entertain such
disloyal sentiments, and had not been guilty
of such disloyal acts as, by the law of Mis-
souri, would preclude them from being voters.
But the committee said they could not take
any such general estimate at all. If a man
relies upon the fact that persons had been
registered who were not entitled to be regis-
tered, then he must show who those persons
were. We say now that we cannot go upon
any general estimate. We decided in that case
that Mr. Van Horn was entitled to his seat,
although there was no evidenceon his side, and
there were abundant witnesses on the other
side who were willing to testify that in their
judgment more than twenty-five hundred men
had voted for Birch who were not disloyal.
We struck out all that testimony in that case,
and we apply the same principle in this case to
a man of our own party, whom we would be
glad to retain on the floor of this House if wo
believed him to have been elected.
But the theory of the sitting member proves
altogether too much. It is said that tl^is fear
was so universal and all-pervading that it need
not he put in evidence, that everybody knew
it without being told. Now, sir, a recurrence
to a very few tacts will show how fallacious
this is. In the lirst place, the vote of this
county fell short by eight or nine hundred
votes of that which was cast in 1800.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. BENJAMIN obtained the floor.
Mr. POLAND. If the gentleman from
Missouri [Mr. Bexjamin] will yield to me a
moment I desire, as the contestant in this ease
may. in a certain contingency, desire to address
the House, to move that he be permitted, if he
should desire it, to do so under the rules of the
House.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. BENJAMIN next addressed the House.
Before the conclusion of his remarks he yielded
for the transaction of other business. His
speech, when concluded, will be published
entire.
