Treasury or the military, that you will deal with them in the most summary manner, and report the names of persons engaged in such transactions and each case. Mr. Dillon, Treasury agent, will be in Nashville in a few days and will confer with you upon this subject. I wish our would direct the attention of the military under your command to this subject, and especially General Hatch, at Montgomery.

ANDREW JOHNSON,

President United States.

DETROIT, MICH., August 14, 1865-6.30 p.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Now that the elections are over in Kentucky and Tennessee, I think a large number of troops might be mustered out from those two States. I would recommend that General Thomas be directed to muster out all he can dispense with, especially of cavalry.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

EXECUTIVE OFFICE,

Washington, August 14, 1865-6 p.m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville, Tenn.:

From information lodged here the Freedmen's Bureau at Nashville and Pulaski are assuming and exercising powers in taking charge of property and other jurisdiction which is incompatible with the law creating the bureau and the design of its creation. I hope you will give it some attention, and if you deem it best some suitable and efficient agent will be at once appointed to investigate its proceedings. I fear the operations of Treasury agents and the Freedmen's Bureau are creating great prejudice to the Government, and their abuses must be corrected.

ANDREW JOHNSON,

President United States.

CARBONDALE, ILL., August 14, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

I hereby tender my resignation as major-general of volunteers, and ask as a favor to me that it be accepted, there being no necessity for my services longer. It is important that I be permitted to resign. If I am not permitted to do so, please extend my leave of absence until 1st of October. Matters of pecuniary interest in settling my business of long standing demand my attention. Please answer me at once at this place.
