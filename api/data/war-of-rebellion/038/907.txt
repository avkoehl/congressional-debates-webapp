Brigadier General John S. BOWEN:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs that you hold your brigade in readiness to move at a moment's warning to any portion of the line. Stevenson's left has been hard pressed this morning.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,J. C. TAYLOR,

Aide-de-camp.

[Indorsement.]

My command has been to Lee's aid, and Green is still there. Forney's right is now threatened, and every man of Cockrell's out of the trenches has been ordered to him, on Baldwin's Ferry road.

Respectfully,

JNO. S. BOWEN.

H. C. TUPPER, Aide-de-Camp:

SIR: In obedience to orders, I have the honor to forward the above return of men present in this DIVISION. The former return, to which you refer, included only those in the trenches. Most of the extra-duty men are now in ranks, but there are many sick and slightly wounded in camp. The latter are mostly employed in carrying rations to the rest.

Very respectfully,

JNO. BOWEN.

Vicksburg, May 22, 1863.

Major General John H. FORNEY, Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: I am directed by the lieutenant-general commanding to say that he is informed the enemy is in possession of the ditch on General Lee's left. It is absolutely necessary that they be dislodged. It may be done by throwing into them shrapnel with short fuses, say two seconds. If not, you must mass sufficient troops to accomplish this object.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. W. MEMMINGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
