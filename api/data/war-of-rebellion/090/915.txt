the case; Custer's brigade may have crossed there. The enemy, who now have Shepherdstown, will perhaps cross, in which case I want you to keep close in on their left flank and pitch into them. It is reported that Fitz Lee has gone by way of Martinsburg, in which case you must look out for him. If Custer has crossed he can join his division, as I will send it toward South Mountain Pass; please inform him.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

If you and Custer are pressed by Fitz Lee's cavalry pitch into it; you must defeat him if possible.

Major-General.
