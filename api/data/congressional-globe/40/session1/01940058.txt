order to move to refer this resolution to the
Committee of Ways and Means when ap-
pointed?
The SPEAKER. That motion will then be
in order.
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. I hope the call for
the previous question will not be seconded. I

without some investigation by a proper com-
mittee.

call for the previous question; and upon a
division, there wereâ€”ayes 26, noes 55.

resolution be referred to the Committee of
Ways and Means when appointed; and upon
that motion I call for the previous question.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered: and under the operation

Mr. WILSON, of Iowa, moved to reconsider

motion to reconsider be laid on the table.

that if the bill contains an appropriation, and
the point of order is made, it must be referred

vious question should not be seconded, and the
bill gives rise to debate, then it will go over, as
a simple resolution would, under the rule.
Mr. MYERS. I then introduce a bill to
increase the force in the Patent Office, and for
other purposes; and if there is no serious
opposition I shall ask that the bill be acted
upon now.
