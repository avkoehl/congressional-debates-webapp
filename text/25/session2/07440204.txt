Making public officers deposita) íes—Mr. Mot ris.
Sciate
are told that this is now the state oí the public mind
in this countrj, that it is, upon the present «¡uestion,
deeply excited, . i.d violently agitated Without
admitting, I will not, foi sake of the argument,
deny the lact, but, sir, it is worthv of gra\e consi-
deration «hat has been the mam cause, and among
w hat portion of our cilr/ens this agitation exists
It is true, that legis'ative bo lu.s have spoken, th it
public meetings have spoken, but ha^o die people,
the great body of jour intelligent vtomani), spo-
ken' I answer no It is the po'iticians and the
lidding commumtj aioni that have spoken, and
«■anting the suie foundation ot tiulh, and the basts
ol the Constitutiot on which to lest their aigu-
ments, the) ha\e resorted to declamation, to fiction,
imagination and fancy, to rouse the pmi < r to their
aid It has been urged upon us that this phospho-
nc light proceeds irorn the genuine bla.se oi publ'c
ieehng    I cannot believe it
Sir, allusions have been often made in the de-
bate on this bill, to instructions sent hue irom the
L gislaluies of the diiTelent Stales I feci m>sell
involved in those allusions, and before I pi nut d
to etamme the great principles of the question be-
foie Us, 1 must ask the indulgence ol the Senate to
adjust, settle, and cancel this pnvate account, so
far as it respects my-elt \. demand which the
Legislature of my tun Statu have mude upon nit,
and, like the banks, I ad dispo I to i el use spe-
cific paj mtnt It is true, su that this lionoiablt
body have no particular inteicst in this mattei It
is a question alone between a membei and his con-
stituent'!, but payment is demanded hue, mil lice,
if any where the battle is to be fought, the protest
entered, and the answer given Had my honoia-
ble colleague, when he presented the resolution
and declaration oí our State, have felt it piopcr to
have made any remarks, I should have availed mj-
self of that opportunity to have said then what I
ftel my indispensable duty to say now I lejoice
that theGeneial Assembly ol my State has thought
propel to expiess their opin oils and sentiments, on
the present occasion I considei it not only the
right, but the duly, of tin Plates to watch, with
jealous i,iie, every actioa ot tin Genual («overt!

instruction remains forever thi same To protect
and piesetve the public liberty, promote the mte-
lest and welfare ol the country, by lepioof, admo-
nition, and instruction, lo them with whom they
have mstrus'ed, even for a shoit period, a pojtion
of their power, is not only the right, but the dut),
ol the constituent body Believing, thtn, as I do,
in the right of instruction, I find myself ditfuwg,
howevei, with gentlemen who hold the same doo-
tnne, in the otigin, lorce and b n ting efficacy, ol
that right I cannot believe that thi doitrincoi
instruction ought to oe so ixciused ?4 to inaL- void,
abridge, change, or alter, the will of the people as
expiessed in constitutional foi ma, or to require
their representatives le do etlliPt a dishonc tor dis-
honorable act I hold that the Constituti m is the
every d ly expressed will ot the people, and cairn it
be altered oi changed m mv other mode than that

appointment to oilice, toey hid a tight n il only to

nion (the veiy cause, no doubt,of hiselection) ilur

opinion, is, that those who have Ihe power ol elec-
tion, loi the tine being, m their hands, have the
nj,ht lo the Government ot the count, y dunng the
penod ioi which those elected can hold their ofn-
c dl stations Our safety against the abuse of
power, or the existence of any permanent evil in
the countiy, brought upon it by any act ol the Go-
vernment, is found m the liequency of elections
I have always believed, su, that, uudei om fotm
of Government, the «ill of the people, as expressed
by their reptestntatives, w as obligatory upon all,
until altered or abrogated by the same will, ex-
pressed m the same constitutional lorm. I hold,
theieloie, that the will of the people of the State
whichlhavt the honor m pan to lepicsent here,
as expressed by the Legislatim in mj election as
Scnuor, is, m all cases m which my opinion
was known, at that turn, to that body, obli-
gatory duiing the com>ulu>.onal term, not only
upon mjst,1!, but upon the State I represent,
so far a , ni) single voice can go, during
that teim If this not the tiuc caw, I am unable
to see any thing like sifct) oi stability in om sys-
tem of Government It the piesent Legislature
of my State can justly, b) way oí instructions, íe-
quire me to change m) opinion, 1 cannot sec why I
should not be equally justifiable in saying I had
changed mv self, and thus play false with those who
wcie my immediate constituents II doctrine ol
this kind can be sustained and biought into prac-
tice, instead ot vvimcnlaws and constitutions, b)
vvhiji alone libeitv can exist, all our rights would
depend on unwritten laws, promulgated by the
bieath ot pipulai opinion, and brought into action
1>) some momentary and exciting cause, and in-
stead of sustaining pimciple, would operate on
men, and would eventually be Jound lo carry into
eflect its mándales by mobs and violence The
General Assembly ol my State seemed to be aware
of die great fundamental truths I have suggested,
and have disclaimed the power to give binding- in-
structions U then co-oiduate representatives in
Cimgtess That instructions are not legally bind-
ing w ill, I think, be admitted bv all, but this, in-

gislative in the pass igc of the resolution thty have
sent us
I h ve given, su, to this resolution and decla-
ration my most serious attention, tnd, I trust, I
havedone so without any party feeling or party
spun, and I am unable to discover but two impor-
tant objects which tin Legislature hail m view.
The fust is ihe listrihution e f ihi proceed-s of the
public huís uní ngst dm s vcial States, and the
other tin establishment, by Confess, ol a United
Stilts Bank All othci propositions assumed oi
laidiUitntc, I believe, weit considered as auxt
li uy to the i, ind ot rruie r impe itancc I eon si-
de i the ie lution a instructing irn, to vote for
be li those measures, should tiny be biought bufóte
the Senate, and against any m mu that was cal-
culate! t; elefeit eithei The piestion now for me
lo decide i-, <m I 1 omid, oi ou,ht I to obeyt My
msuer is, I am un li r no m <ral or political obliga-
tion te> do so Sh ill I th n, resign my scat here'
Not f i this caire It was, >ir, a well known and
nc ton ins fact, at the time I had the honoi to ie
i 'ect" 1 to a seat in this be dy, Ih tt 1 was opposed lo
i dt tnbii ion oí the pn tee ds of the public lands
une ngst the sever il Staies, and .ho to the esta-
blishment of a National Dank by Congrc s I be-
lieved then, as 1 believe now, that both those mta-
suit^ aienit within the constitutional power ol
this Goveiiimtn1, and I have no doubt but the
lucmbci  of the pie sent -Gencial Assembly of my
Staie wj'l do me the justice to iccognise this fact
1 contend, then ibat this was the opinion ol the
Lpgisldtuie that elected me to the oihee of Seiiatoi
in this body  I therefore most respectfully beg leave
to change ihe question with the present General As-
sembly, and in my turn, ask th«ra if they did not ex-
pect and believe that every persoá which they have
or should elect to office would faithfully carry
out the principles and doctrines which induced his
election? And, if it was now the proper lime
for ihe election of a Senator to Congress, would
they not look for, and select a man who would de-
lend, and laithfully support, and vote for the prin-
ciples contained in the resolution which they have
sent us, and would they not deem htm base and
unwoitny, if for any cause or motive, he would
betray the trust thus confided to his hands1 Sir,
as fai as I am personally acquained with the mem-
bers of the present General Assembly of my State, I
know them to be men of honorable minds, and high
moral worth, and I believe all the others areol
like chaiacter, and I will venture to answer for
them in the affirmative to the question I have put.
If faith thus plighted, and thus relied on, by which
an important ofhcial station had been conferred
was to be broken by instructions afterwards given,
Ihe most gross imposition upon the country might,
and no doubt would, often take place An impor-
tant question is before the public, which must be
decided by Congress. A United States Senator is
lo be chosen who will have a vote on this ques-
tion, the people have that object m view in the
election ot their State Legislatures, o large majority
of intmbers an returned on one side of that ques-
tion, they respond to the will of their constituents,
and elect a man to the Senate of the United States
professedly in favor ol the will oi that majority,
the people have confidence in his integrity, they
know tin. term of service is six years, and no other
topic exists m which so deep an interest is felt.
Many at the succeeding election neglect to attend
the polls,chance, accident, or mere neglect, produces
the election of a diffeient «etof men, with different
political views to the next Legislature They instruct
the Senatoi.who has but barely taken his seat,
to vote against his known, and expressed opinions,
etpicssed at the turn of his election, and, Ql course,
¡igvmst Ihe opinions and principles of those who
elected him Shall he obey, and thus deceive his im-
mediate contituents, and lay a foundation for the
ptactieeof every political fraud' I will submit the
question, sir, to the people I have the honoi to repre-
sent bcie, as well as the Legislature, and I am
much mistaken indeed, if the response irora both
will not be that the representative ought to do his
duty faithfully to the best of lus ability, as he had
engaged to do at the time of his election No man
has a more profound respect tor the Legislature
ot his State than I have for mine, and this respect
u not in the least degree abated, nor ought it to be,
because the present Legislatuie is, as I understand,
of different political opinions with myself. I view
their rights and my duty the same as it were other-
wise, and I believe in this particular case, in re-
fusing obedience to the íesoluüon now before me,
I am, in fact, but carrying into practice the doctrines
which the present legislative body itself would
acknowledge coneet In all new cases, oreases ib
which Ihe opinion of a teprc semative was not known
at the time ol his election, he ought to obey the
instructions oí the constituent body, or resign his
seat I speak m no invidious sense when I say I
hold the Virginia doctunc correct on this subject.
Theic may be cases, however, in which the repre-
sentative may be full convinced, that disobedience
is the only alternative left him to save his country
from some impending dangei in such an event, he
ought to throw himself into the breach, but he
should immedniely thereafter surrender his trust
But, sir, there is no circumstance, in my opinion,
that would justify my holding a seat here, and
giving a vote that both my judgment and conscience
should condemn, because I was instructed to do so
ty my powei uponeaith. I regret my peculiar
si'uation has lmdtrcd it necessaiy thai the time
ot the Senate, on the present occasions should be
taken up with this explanation of my views, but as
othci otates have instructed their Senators, as tt 
the vote they shall give on the present bill, no one,
1 U List, will believe that I have, without reason, thus
fat overlooked the immediate questionJbefoie J  
What, sir, then, is that question'? It is,does there
exist a vital inherent power m this Government
