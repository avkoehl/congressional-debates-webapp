Colonel JOHN LEVERING,Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of Arkansas:

The boats that return to Little Rock should be loaded heavily with commissary stores and returned here on the high water. Sales of subsistence stores were made to over 4,000 persons at Fort Gibson for the ten days ending March 31, and 5,000 more reported by the Indian agent and brigade commander in a starving condition. The suffering of the people is very great. Fort Gibson will require a large amount of stores if those who are starving are fed. Send all the supplies you can and I will relieve the suffering as far as possible.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
