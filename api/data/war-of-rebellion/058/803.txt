Major General W. T. MARTIN,Commanding Cavalry, East Tennessee:

The lieutenant-general commanding, under orders from the President, directs that you, with your own division of cavalry, proceed at once, by the most practicable route, to join General J. E.

You will leave Dibrell's brigade and the Texas brigade in position at Newport and will transmit to them such orders as you have. You will advise us how soon you can make your arrangements for leaving. The lieutenant-general commanding give you these orders with regret.
