Department. He knows best what he wants, and when and were and where, and directs everything according to this own plans. He reports confidentially that only three corps of my army, all told, have been engaged. You need not be told that this is less than half of the army in his command and actually with him. Further accumulation of troops, not called for by him, would exhaust his supplies and engaged his plans. Be patient.

WILLIAM H. SEWARD,

(Secretary of State.)
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 6, 1863 - 4.30 p. m.

His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

Have this moment returned to camp. On my way received your telegrams of 11 a. m. and 12.30. The army had previously recrossed the river, and was on its return to camp. As it had none of its trains of supplies with it, I deemed this advisable. Above, I saw no way of giving the enemy a general battle with the prospect of success which I desire. Not to exceed three corps, all told, of my troops have been engaged. For the whole to go in, there is a better place nearer at hand. Will write you at length to-night. Am glad to hear that a portion of the cavalry have at length turned up. One position did nothing.

Major-General.
