9.20 p. m., General Stanley reports that he has directed Colonel Grose to relieve Kirby's brigade before daylight, but he will be strung out in one line. By extending, he can cover Whitaker's front. Shall he do so? 11 p. m., replied that General Palmer will be requested to relieve Whitaker's brigade in the morning.

June 26.- Was told by General Thomas this a. m. that we would attack the enemy to-morrow morning, and he indicated how it would be done. 12.15 p. m., received Special Field Orders, Numbers 28, headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, dated near Kenesaw Mountain, June 24, 1864, stating:*

3 p. m., received Special Field Orders, No.-, dated headquarters Department of the Cumberland, in the field, near Kenesaw Mountain, June 26, stating:*

9 p. m., issued Special Orders, Numbers 98, from these headquarters (near Kenesaw Mountain, Ga.) as follows:*

Last night Davis' division, of Fourteenth Corps, moved over and took position about the rear of Stanley's right and the left of the Twentieth Corps. Baird's division, of same corps, will move over to-day.

June 27.- 5.30 a. m., the points at which Wood's and Stanley's divisions were to mass were pointed out. The country is so thickly wooded, and the topography is such that it is almost impossible to tell anything about the enemy's works. It cannot be done by a reconnaissance, as such would be almost as fatal as an assault. The works cannot be seen before we can get right upon them. We are about to make an assault upon works we know little about. The attack to be made by Newton's division at the point mentioned in Special Orders, Numbers 98, from these headquarters, June 26, 1864. Newton's division formed as follows: Harker's brigade was formed on the right in two columns. His right column consisted of one regiments, in close column by division, left in front. His left column was composed of the balance of his regiments, in close column by division, right in front. General Wagner's brigade was on Harker's left, in one column, his regiments being formed in close column, left in front. General Kimball was in echelon on the extreme left, in one column, with the same formation, right in front. Grose's brigade, of Stanley's division, held Stanley's works. Whitaker's brigade, of same division, followed Harker's brigade as a support, in column of deployed regiments. Kirby's brigade, of same division, followed Wagner, in column with two regiments front, deployed. General Wood left one brigade in his works, and formed one in two lines in the rear of General Newton's division, and his remaining brigade in two lines in the rear and to the left of Newton's division, ready to protect the left. The troops could not be got ready to advance by 8 a. m.; also had to wait for General Palmer to get ready. 8 a. m., sent word to division commanders that the signal of advance would be the opening of the battery in front of Grose's brigade. 9 a. m., advance guns fired and skirmishing commenced directly afterward. 9.10 a. m. received word from General Thomas to push ahead. Enemy now opened artillery, with heavy fire of musketry. 9.25 a. m., General Harker sends a report (he is in front) that General Davis' division, which is on our right and is moving conjointly with us, is giving away. This report at once sent to General Thomas. General H[arker] also reports that the enemy's works are formidable,
