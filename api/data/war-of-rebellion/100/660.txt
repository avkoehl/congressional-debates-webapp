WASHINGTON, June 22, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Secretary of War recommend that Colonel George P. Este, Fourteenth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry and brevet brigadier-general, U. S. Volunteers, be appointed an full brigadier-general of volunteers. I make this recommendation in view of the fact that he has been strongly recommended for the position by his immediate commanding officers, for his ability and gallantry in the field. He is now about to retire from the service and I think it would be a just recognition of his services to afford him the opportunity of resigning from a brigadier-general.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
