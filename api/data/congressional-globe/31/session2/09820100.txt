APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL 6IX>BE.
Man. 22,
31st Cong 2d Sess.
ics are turned out of employment, and compelled
to become agriculturists—a business to which tliey
have always been entire strangers. By this means
the interests of "lie farmer are materially injured,
by increasing the supply of agricultural products
in the market, while the demand must be greatly
diminished, and, as a necessary consequence, the
price reduced.
I have said the capitalist could withdraw his
funds from the business of manufacturing, send
his money abroad, and become an importer of the
same fabrics he had made, and thus not only sup-
port himself and family, but add greatly to his
wealth. How is it with the laborer? Can he,
when turned out of employment, send his capital
abroad and receive in return a rich reward for its
investment? What is the poor man's capital but
his strong right arm, his integrity of heart, and
the skill and intellect given him by his Maker?
These, these, Mr. Chairman, are his capital; and
if properly protected by the laws of his Govern-
ment, they are a never failing source of support
and happiness to himself and his family, and the
probable, and almost certain means of wealth and
independence. But how is this capital to be made
available abroad? Can he cut off his strong right
arm, or pluck out his honest and manly heart, and
send them to Europe? And will they produce a
rich return to add to his wealth, or contribute to
the support of his wife and his children, who cry to
him for bread ?
I have said that these laborers, thus turned out
of employment, would be compelled to become
producers—and so they would. But k should be
borne in mind, that but few of them would be able ,
to purchase land of their own, while agriojJtural
labor is abundant and cheap, on accounWf the
heavy immigration from abroad. Their ignorance
of the business of farming, together with the
abundant supply of labor in the market, and the
low prices of produce, would render it almost im-
possible for them to procure employment at all.
Great privation and suffering must necessarily
ensue. [
Thus, Mr. Chairman, have I shown conclu- i
sively, I trust, that without protection, all -other j
things being equal, the great difference between j
the price of labor in Europe and this country, ;
(and I never wish to see the wages of labor
reduced,) must forever prevent a successful com-
petition for the home market, drive capital into
other channels, break down every branch of j
American manufactures, injure the farmer by in-
creasing the number of producers and destroying
his home market, and finally lead to the depression
and degradation of the honest, industrious, and
energetic laborers of the United States to a level
with the pauper laborers of the Old World—which
every patriot would deplore.
Tnese are some of the direct and immediate re-
sults that, would flow from the establishment of
a system of free trade. But they are not all.
There are others not so immediate, but no less
certain and destructive.
By abandoning all manufactures, as we shall be
obliged to do, without aid from the Government,
we must then import every article we need from
Europe. These foreign imports must be paid for.
But a very small portion of our breadstuff's would
be taken, and the balance paid in money. Tliis
in a short time would exhaust the entire amount
of specie in the country, and leave us a ruined and
bankrupt people, with the granaries of our farmers
filled to overflowing and rotting on their hands for
want of a market. Our money alj gone to pay
foreign laborers, while our own mechanics and
laborers are deprived of the means of providing a
living for themselves and their families, ruin and
disaster, blight and mildew, would overwhelm
every branch of business, and we should be
again reduced to that state of colonial vassalage,
from which we were rescued by the wisdom, cour-
age, and patriotism of our fathers.
It would afford me great pleasure to dwell on
these most interesting topics, but I am admonished
that my hour is rapidly passing away. As there
are many gentlemen on this floor who are abund-
antly able to advocate the interests of the various
branches of industry in their respective States, I
•hall confine myself chiefly to those branches of
industry and enterprise embraced, in or affected
by, the manufacture of iron in Pennsylvania.
The Tariff Question—Mr. Hampton.
In order, Mr. Chairman, to a right understand-
ing of the importance of this subject, it will be
necessary to lay before you some facts and statis-
tics, not generally known by those whose interests
are not immediately affected bv them.
For the following statistics, 1 am indebted to the
labors of a convention of iron manufacturers which
met in Philadelphia in December, 1849, and they
are believed to be correct:
The total number of counties in the State is 62
Of these, the number now containing iron
works is 45
The number containing no iron works is 17
Of these seventeen counties, however, nine con-
tain abundance of iron ore and coal, but having
no facilities of getting to market, they remain un-
touched, leaving only eight counties out of the
sixty-two in the State not suited to the manufac-
ture of iron.

Fifteen furnaces were sold by the sheriff during
the first four months of the last year, and other
sales under execution will, reduce the number in
blast still lower. A comparison of the make of
1850 with that of 1847 shows a decrease of 190,537
tons, or forty-nine rf^hent. in three years. If the
present state of tl^^s continues, the make of
1851 will not exceed 100,000 tons.
CONVERSION or C^T INTO WROUGHT IRON.
The following table shows the number of forges
and rolling-mills in the State; the investment in
lands, buildings, and machinery; the total num-
ber of converting fires, and their capacity per
annum, and their make in 1847 and 1849:

The amount made in 1849 shows a falling off
from that of 1847 of 66,874 tons, or thirty-three
per cent.
In the eastern part of the State every descrip-
tion of manufactured iron that comes in competi-
tion with tlje English, is, to a great extent, driven
out of the market, and its manufacture has been
almost entirely suspended. All the markets at
all accessible from the lakes or the sea, have been
supplied from abroad.
But little railroad iron is manufactured, and
that only for the interior of the State. In this
branch of manufacture, small as it is, the follow-
ing decline is shown:
Present capacity of the State 64,400 tons rails
In 1847 were made 40,966 do.
In 1849 do...do 18,973 do.
Decrease in two years, 21,993 tons, or 54 per
!! cent.
J The other rolling mills that are attempting to
' run at all, are chiefly sustained by the manufac-
ture of boiler plates and cut nails, which are not
so much affected by foreign competition, though
the demand and prices have been much reduced
by it.
Cut nails are exclusively of American invention
and manufacture. The number of nail machines
in the State is 606. The annual productions of
each machine average 1000 kegsi, of 100 pounds
each—making 606,000 kegs, or 30,300 tons a
year. Of the product of the forges, two thirds are
sold in the form of blooms to the rolling mills, and
are manufactured into boiler plates, liorse-shoe
rods, and bars, for the manufacture of scythes,
axes, edge tools, and cutlery, and other articles
requiring a high polish. The remaining one third
is sold in the form of hammered bar iron in com-
petition with Swedish and Russian iron.
We have in the State thirteen works engaged in
the manufacture of steel—seven in the eastern and
six in the western part. Those in the East are
situated in Philadelphia, Lancaster, and York
1 counties. Those in the West are all in the county
of Allegheny, which composes my own district.
These works produce, annually, over six thousand
| tons of steel.
RECAPITULATION.
The total number of iron works in the State is 504
The capital invested in lands, buildings, and ma-
chinery $20,502,076
The number of men employed   .30,103
1 The number of horses employed 13,562
The capital invested includes only such lands
and buildings as belong to the iron manufacturers,
and such as are directly dependent on iron works
for their value.
Thus the value of farms, grist and saw-mills,
and similar property, horses, wagons, tools, &c.,
and the dwellings of workmen near large cities
are excluded, because, though belongingt.o the
works, and their value greatly affected by them,
yet tney have, to some extent, an independent
. value.
1 The value of all coal lands has also been ex-
cluded, both for the reason before given and be-
cause it is the custom generally to purchase coal
delivered at the works. The capital and men and.
horses employed in mining and transporting this
coal to the works, and carrying the iron to mar-
ket, have not been included iji the above account,
because nothing more than a mere conjectural es-
timate can be formed without more accurate in-
formation than I possess at present.
More than one half of the anthracite furnaces,
and a portion of the charcoal furnaces, purchase
their ore of the farmers in their vicinity. There
are other large ore banks in the State belonging to
parties who work them and sell the ore to the fur-
naces in their neighborhood. The value of all
these ore banks, and the number of laborers em-
ployed at them, are also excluded from this ac-
count.
Estimates have been made, however, from data
believed to be reliable, of the number of laborers
; not in the pay of the iron manufacturers, but di-
rectly dependent on the iron works for support,
amounting to 7,081 for blast furnaces, and 4,432
for rolling-mills, forges, &c., making together,
11,513, to be added to the number before stated,
or a grand total of 41,616 men dependent on the
iron business in the State. Allowing five persons
to each laborer, which is believed to be an under
estimate, we have a population of 208,080 persons,
or nearly one tenth of the entire population of the
State, dependent on the manufacture of iron.
The consumption of fuel in all the iron works
of the State in 1847, was as follows:
Anthracite coa], 483,000 tons, at an average value
of $3 per ton $1,449,000
Bituminous coal, 9,007,600 bushels, at
5 cents per bushel  450,380
Wood, including cost Of con verting into
charcoal and delivering at furnace... 2,980,504
Total value $4,879,884
About the year 1842 a great impetus was given
j to business, owing to the discovery a few years be-
i fore that of the value of anthracite coal for the pur-
