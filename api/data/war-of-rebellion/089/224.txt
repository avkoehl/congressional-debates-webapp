Brigadier-General KAUTZ,

Commanding Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: It seems to me very desirable to ascertain how far the enemy's intrenchments extend to our right, and whether or not they are on the Charles City road. Cannot your skirmishers between Ames' right and the Charles City road drive in the enemy's skirmishers, so as to determine the location and extent of their works in that quarter? I have ordered Ames to attack, and an advance of your skirmishers will aid him.

Very respectfully,

A. H. TERRY,

Brevet Major-General.
