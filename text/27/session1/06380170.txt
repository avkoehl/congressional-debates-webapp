APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July, 1841.
27th Cong. •• 1st Sess.
Public Lands—Mr. Pickens
H. of Reps.
appticaiion now belore this body ' Let me direct
your attention to the conduct of that distinguished
hero and statesman, at the mentien of whose name
every patriotic bosom swells with manly pride, and
whose achievements during our late bloody con-
flict with England, has no parallel in the history of
that eventful war. I allude to the illustrious Jack-
son, who, when in command at New Orleans, cp
posed to one of the best disciplined armies of Eu-
rope, whose valor had overcome and overthrown
some of the best troops and the greatest hero of tae
age—when opposed by such a foe, vastly superior
in numbers, and surrounded oy internal and do
mesne enemits—cowards and traitor-5 to the coun-
try—it became necessary, in the discharge of his
high military f unctions.and for the safety and protec-
tion of hi¡> beloved country, and especially to protect
the city of New Orleans, with its beauty and booty,
from the ruthless insulto and ravages of an infuri-
ated soldiery, lo remove beyond the lines of his en-
campment a judicial officer, who was interfering
with his military arrangements, by sowing di scn-
tions, and creating disturbances, calculated to baf-
fle, if not to defeat his purposes, in (hat important
crisis. For this offence he was afterwards ar-
raigned before the same judicial officer, and fined
m the sum of one thousand dollars, which was
promptly paid by him out of hu own private funds
The indignation or th> populace and soldiers, at
this unjust sentence, vas such, that the Judge
feared to pronounce n, until he was assured by Gs
neral Jackson that the same arm which had pro-
tected the city from pillage and plunder, would
protect him in the proper discharge ot his official
duties. The surrounding multitude, grateful foi
their miraculous deliveiance, and their hears
swelling with patriotic grantucc to the hero who
had «o signally preserved their rights and prop r-
ty, and exasperated against what ihey supposed to
be an unjust and unrighteous sentence, spon'ane
ously umled, and raised not only the sum of one
thousand dtllars but a much larger amoun , and
tendered it to their pr tector as a grateful often g
of their feelirgs «ridiegard for him But did ne
accept Vl Was money any objei t to him' Had
he ribked his lile and forlune for mere mercenary
purposes'? I answer no This more  ih-\n Roiin
hero, conscious in the íectilude of his purpo.es,
though smarting under the penally of one thousand
dollars, which tiai been unjustly filtched from his
pockets, ut erly refused t> receive it He did not
hug the glittering trash to his bosom. No, sn, he
looked to another quarter, the grat (ude of a ge ie-
rous people, tor hlsieward
And now, sir, before I take my seal, I have a
word to say to the gentlemen from Indiana, [Mr
White and Mr. Lane ] who on yesterday pounad
upon me with such savage mry I was so .ie
what surprised to =eo the exc tement which
these gentlemen man e ted on that occasion
II did not call them to older, because I nevsr
call member-, to order, and I feel that 1 am
now descending very much in roucmg the
gross and abusive epithets applied to me by
thera. I feel that I oui>ht ra hei to treat them with
perfect contempt I supposed, sir, that the time
and the occasion was such tl at any one who had
any regard for the memory of General Hamson,
would have felt dispos d to ¡ ave discussed faicly
and calmly the men s ot this bill, that they would
have ureed reasuns, and not pas ions cr (.enuncia-
tions Yes, sir, th  sable habilimeR's of mrarn
ing which now «uiroucd you, shoild have admo-
nished gent emen (at least) ol the impnpney of
getung up an angry di cus^ on on ihs <ccasion
And the f lends of G neral HUrri on, who were
about to plunder the public Trea urv, by gianung
a donation ct twenty five thousand dol'ars to his jvi-
dow and heirs, -hotl l haie I en Ihe last to have
denounced in suth unmtasu id leans thoce who
opposed th m
The gentleman, too, from O'no [Mr Pendí f-
ton] has thought propei lo remark, that I had ' de
served his una loyed contempt."
Mr Pendleton arose and said that he had ne -
ther used nor mtimaied such an expie-ssion.
Mr Dean Well, sir, I did not hear you d s-
tmcily, but I so understood job, and I believe it is
so reported.
Mr Pendleton again explained that Mr Dean
had misapprehended him, that he had used no
such expression
Mr Dean said, very well, sir, I will then attend
to the gentlemen from Indiana I understood tnem
both to talk aoout my "achieving -n infamous im-
mortality by opposing this bill " To this, <n, I
shall only say that their frothy declamations and
ongentlemanly epuhets are well calculated to give
an infamous immortality to their name , which is,
no douot the mghest distinction to which their arabi
tion aspire-* They are welcome to the enjoyment
cf it all I envy not the immortal ty of the man
who disregards the rules o' moral propriety, and
as they move along the stream of life, they may
find themselves distinguished—ye , sir, immortal-
ized—for tneir low epithets and vukir black-
guardism
The gpp leman from Indiana [Mr White] has
talked aboat my gray hairs, and the sudden fury
witn which he broke out, reminded me of the bu"st
ing of a cider harrel, bit to be serious, h° talked
about my gray hairs Was not that a fine exhi
bition of feeling for so young a man' I admit that
my hain are gray, and that my head is bearing
blossoms for the grave, but is that a good reason
why a young man should attack me with such sa-
vafe violence, because I expressed my conscien-
tious scruples against this bill? If I am old, and
mv hairs g(ay, I ihmk I have been, in the course
of my life, where that young man would shrink
from being So far from dei' acting from the lau-
rels of an old soldier, I can never do it, I have seen
service mycelf, and can feel for one who has served
his country as such I have seen the hardsh ps of
those who have fought fo their country—I know
b )th the feelings aid the heart of a soldier, and
sucti a man, who has served his country faithfully,
can nevtr receive censure fiom my hands I would
rather have my ngnt aim severed from my shoul-
der, thin I wou'd detract a ngle iota from ihe ho-
nor of a soldier of this nation
My colleigue from Olni, [Gen Stokely,] un-
dertook to read me a lecture about my constituent .
I can tell that gentleman, in"ill kindness, that he
had better attend to his own busme s-—to take care
o his own constituents, and let mine alone That
gentleman will find enough two years hence to
satisfy hi  constituents of trie propriety of thru ting
his hand into the public Treasury, and gratuitously
bestowing $25 000 upon the wealthy widow and
heir oí General Harrison becauset cy are among
tne rich and noble of the land If the gentlemin
cm sat «¡fy his conscience in violating the Ci utu-
tioi in this manner, I doubt much whether he will
be-ble to satisfy hi-, consü'uent that th  pivmg
aw*} of the public money to nefray the elec mn-
eermg expei ses of a public officer, i  no violation
of the Consti ution He will find that tncy che-
rish the saeredness of lhat instrument, with a vigi-
lance that brooks no attack upon it, tnd unless he
shall be able to satisfy them that it is con-
stitutionally rgH to give away the pub'ic money
¡p defiay the electioneering expenses of a success-
ful candidate for office, h° can hardly expect lo
meet their approbation. Bat, sir, there is one ar-
gumentadvanced by thegent!emen that is worthy th 
attention of the commiitee, because it discloses ihe
true ground on i hich this donation is based Th?
pemleman says lhat General Harri on was an
t pen, generous, free hearted man, tha' the latch-
stnrs; wa al«ajs out of the door, and tint his ru-
men us friends who flocked 10 see him during the
electi n campaign, subjected him to great expense,
and therefo e it vas right he-diould be remunerat d
Is this, s r, a good reason, do-s this warrant us as
kg siaiors-, to hrast our ha ds imo the r-ub'ic Trea-
sury and make this donation' What s¡r, are ihe
hungry office hunt ng par isans «ho were led at
h s board and par ook of hi> bcanty, to have the r
«.xperses pail from ihe public purse by a don, an
rom this G)iemneat to the «vidov aid he r of
General Hal s^n' No, str, I trust not. I trust,
sir, lhat other and stron,er reisois than am lhat
hare yet be o offered, must he pre ented before
th s House «ill consent gratm rusly to bestow
upon the widow and heirs o General Harrison th 
sum of $25 000 or any sum whatever
Sir, how many of those old soldiers—that more
t ian Spartan band oi he ot  who achiev-d our in
dependence, at ihe sacrifice of their time and for-
tune, and are now poor and penniless, and who
have never been remunerated one cent by this Go-
vernment—are no , at thi-5 very moment, knoc king
at our doois, and entreating, yes, sir, supplicating
us to do thetn that long deferred justice which has
been withheld from I hem, instead of bestowing
our bounty and prodigally lavishing the public
treasury upon the wealthy widow* and he>rs of
General Harrison' Let us be just before we are
gener jus Let us not set this fatal precedent, that
none but the r ch and well born caí receive our
countenance, or become ¡he recipients of cur
boi nty
Mr Proffit said th re was some mistake; that
be undera ood tha' tne gentleman [Mr Dean] had
made charges aganist General Harrison, and a«ked
it the gentleman had read a report of his speech m
the Intelligencer, and if that was true'
Mr Dean I do not know whether that report
of my speech is true or not.
Mr Proffit wi'h the paper in his hand, said
tiat the gentleman certainly had made charges
against General Harrison, for he had compared the
heirs of Charles Ogle with tho e of General Har-
rison
Mr Dean said Mr dairman, I did state that
the heir  of Charles Ogle were as mucn entitled to
ihe bounty of this country as the heirs of General
Harrison, and if that  aea charge again t General
Hprnson, I again repeat it
Mr Prowt here objected to the gentleman's
making a speech, and observed that the gentleman
withdrew any charges, he bad made against Gene
ral Harrison
Mr Dean said I made no charges against Gen.
Harrison, but I reassert ?nd reaffirm every word
that I have said    I withdraw nothing
*I have befor  mc tne Ohio Sun, a paper
puntal in Batavia, in thesouthern part of Ihe State
of Ohio, which gives the following description of
General Harri on's property, and if it were not Irue,
it would, I think, have been con radíete 1

Mr PICKENS sad he di i not rise to trespass
upjn the time of the commit ee by any lengthy
discn s-ion as to the mere details of the b 11 Con-
tradictory and un ound as many of those details
wer-, he ¡eft t^em to be adjusted and modified by
the fnenás of t'e measure It would be his pur-

points involved in it, ard cjnnect it with the other
fiscal measure , which con n ute <ne sjstem as a
whole to ue preser ted by the dominant party at
