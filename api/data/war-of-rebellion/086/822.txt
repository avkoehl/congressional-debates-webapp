PILOT KNOB, December 10, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING:

The order relieving the Forty-seventh Missouri, to proceed to Nashville, will compel me to abandon Patterson, Fredericktown, Sainte Genevieve,, Farmington, Potosi, and Caledonia, and will leave only about 100 men to guard the railroad, of Captain Hannahs' company, of the Fiftieth Missouri, leaving about 190 men at this place, leaving no troops at any of them.

A. W. MAUPIN.

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo., December 10, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel A. W. MAUPIN,

Pilot Knob:

Don't entirely evacuate any of the posts if you can possibly help it, but send small garrisons to take the place of the Forty-seventh withdrawn. I am sending enough cavalry at once to supply the place of the Forty-seventh. Telegraph me what you want at points north of Pilot Knob. You may withdraw bridge guards if you think prudent altogether, and may also for the time being entirely evacuate Sainte Genevieve. I regret that the Forty-seventh cannot be retained, but the orders are peremptory. Assurances are given, however, that it will be sent back as soon as pressing exigency is passed. I will endeavor to relieve you of command of Third Sub-District.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
