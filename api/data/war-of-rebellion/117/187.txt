SIR: Your letter of the 3rd instant asking that your brother-in-law, T. A. Spencer, may be released from confinement at Camp Douglas has been referred to me, and in reply I have to inform you that Mr. Spencer cannot be released unless you can establish that he was forced into the rebel service against his will. On such proof the matter would be referred to the Secretary of War and possibly he would order his release.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,
