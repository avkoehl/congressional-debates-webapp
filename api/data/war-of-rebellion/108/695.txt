HEADQUARTERS,Near Suffolk, April 24, 1863.

Brigadier General H. L. BENNING,

Commanding Brigade:

I am directed to say that if you are satisfied that the avenues from the east side of the swamp are closed up by the bridges being destroyed, &amp;c., you may move your main force back to Gatesville and employ your cavalry on the duty of observing and guarding those roads, and particularly the Chowan. If transport attempt to pass up they should be attacked with your rifled guns and such other means as you may devise to annoy them. It is not material about firing on their gunboats. You may reserve your efforts for transports, particulartly if they are laden with troops. The commanding general would like to have a report from you daily.

I am, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

[18.] Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Near Suffolk, April 25, 1863-8.30 a. m.

Brigadier General H. L. BENNING,

Commanding, &c.:

I am in receipt of your letter of the 24th instant. If you have not already moved back to Gatesville when this reaches you, the commanding general would like you to endeavor to frighten the enemy into burning the bridges on the roads leading from the east side of swamp. so as to effectually prevent and advance upon you from that direction. The commanding general directs that you cause the buffalo, Winslow, and all other undoubted buffaloes or their aiders and abettors to be arrested and sent back for future disposal. Lieutenant D. Connell, Fiftennth Georgia Volunteers, with his guard, has reported here, having in charge two buffaloes and a Yankee deserter. It will be seen that the guard allowed three to escape. It appears singular that an officer and eight armed men could not secure six prisoners. The lieutenant-general commanding deisres you to have the guard promptly punished for their vigilane. It is understood that some deserters from the army are running at large east of the Chowan. It is hoped that you will cause all such to be arrested.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. SOREL,

[18.] Assistant Adjutant-General.

The commanding general desires you to order Captain Graham to burn or destroy all the wharves or landings on the Nensemond, and also those on the James, that he can reach. He should be instructed to make their destruction thorough and complete.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

[18.] Assistant Adjutant-General.
