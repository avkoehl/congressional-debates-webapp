from headquarters Department of New Mexico, herewith inclosed. *) That Major Nelson H. Davis, assistant inspector-general, be breveted lieutenant-colonel for his gallantry in a sharp conflict by troops under his command with Apache Indians in Arizona on the 29th of May, 1864 (see copy of my letter dated June 19, 1864, herewith inclosed+), and colonel for very arduous, faithful, and meritorious services in New Mexico. I say nothing of what this accomplished officer deserves for his gallantry in many great battles while he was in the Army of the Potomac. That division quartermaster, Major Herbert M. Enos, U. S. Army, be breveted as lieutenant-colonel for faithful and meritorious services in New Mexico, where he has been on duty for many years. That Major Peter W. L. Plympton, now of the Seventeenth U. S. Infantry, then captain, be breveted major for conspicuous gallantry in the battle of Valverde, N. Mex., and lieutenant-colonel for meritorious and faithful services in New Mexico. That Major William H. Lewis, now of the Eighteenth U. S. Infantry, be breveted major for gallant and distinguished services in burning the Texan train in the battle of Apache Canon, where he was captain in the Fifth U. S. Infantry, and lieutenant-colonel for meritorious and faithful services in New Mexico. That Major J. Howe Watts, additional paymaster, U. S. Army, be breveted lieutenant-colonel for faithful and meritorious services in New Mexico. I believe I can safely say that for the last three years Major Watts has traveled more through Indian countries and paid more troops than all the rest of the paymasters put together have done. For his services to be overlooked, when the services of others who have done comparatively nothing are complimented by a brevet, must doubtless have been from oversight. That Captain David H. Brotherton, Fifth U. S. Infantry, be breveted major and lieutenant-colonel for gallantry in the battle of Valverde, N. Mex., on the 21st of February, 1862, and for faithful and meritorious services. He is now the commander of this regiment. That Captain William H. Bell, commissary of subsistence, U. S. Army, and chief commissary for a long while of the Department of New Mexico, be breveted as major and as lieutenant-colonel for faithful and meritorious services in New Mexico. Captain Bel was complimented by General McClellan for his services in the Army of the Potomac. He was in several battles, commencing with the first battle of Bull Run. That Captain Asa B. Carey, Thirteenth U. S. Infantry, be breveted major for gallant conduct at the battle of Apache Conon on the 28th day of March, 1862, and lieutenant-colonel for gallant and meritorious services in the war against the Navajoes. (See copy of extract from my letter to the Adjutant-General, dated April 24, 1864, herewith inclosed. +) That Captain John B. Shinn, Third U. S. Artillery, be breveted as major for arduous and meritorious services in successfully bringing his battery across the Yuma and Gila Desirts, and for faithful services in New Mexico. President Lincoln named Captain Shinn for a brevet. This was not acted upon by the Senate. That Captain Henry B. Bristol, Fifth U. S. Infantry, be breveted major and lieutenant-colonel for faithful and meritorious services in New Mexico, and particularly for his untiring zeal and energy in controlling the Navajo tribe of Indians at the Bosque Redondo, and for his praiseworthy efforts to advance their condition from that of savages to that of civilized men. That First Lieutenant Charles Newbold, Fifth U. S. Infantry, be breveted captain for his distinguished gallantry in two successive conflicts with Navajo Indians in New Mexico. That First Lieutenant Nelson Thomasson, Fifth U. S. Infantry, be breveted captain for faithful and meritorious service in New Mexico.
