of attack, as it was executed (see plate ---*). General Gordon, with the Second Corps (Gordon's, Ramseur's, and Pegram's divisions), was to march across the Shenandoah and around the base of Three-Top Mountain by a blind and concealed path, and then to cross the Shenandoah again at Bowman's Ford and turn the enemy's left flank. Kershaw was to go by Strasburg to Bowman's Mill and attack in front of the left; Wharton and the artillery to go by Strasburg to Hupp's Hill and be ready to second the other attacks' Rosser to go by the Back road and engage the cavalry of the enemy' all to be in position and attack at 5 o'clock of the morning of the 19th. Rosser to attack first, then Gordon, and lastly Kershaw (see plate ---*). About dark the streams were bridged and the path cleared out by the pioneers; and Gordon marched at 8 p. m. by the selected route (see plate ---*).

At midnight Kershaw and Wharton started for their positions. Before 5 a. m. of October 19, Kershaw and Wharton were resting on Hupp's Hill and Bowman's Mill road, and Gordon had rested for some time not far from Bowman's Ford on the south bank of the river. Rosser was also in position (see plate ---*). The attack was successfully made, the enemy's pickets driven in, and by sunrise Kershaw and Gordon had occupied the camps and works of the Eighth and Nineteenth Corps, and captured artillery and prisoners (see plate ---*). The Sixth Corps offered a new obstruction, and lines were formed as in plate ---*, and they were driven back to the left of Middletown. A portion of Wharton's division was added to the line and moved against the enemy, but could not cross Meadow Run in consequence of its depth of bed, and was driven back. The artillery then opened and drove the enemy from his position (see plate ---*). A second line was now formed, passing in front of Middletown and to the left (see plate ---*) and some skirmishing and cannonading took place along the line. A portion of the left was advanced some distance (see plate ---*), the enemy in the meantime, deploying his cavalry on his flanks, rallied and formed a line of infantry in the woods on the left of Meadow Run, behind some rude breast-works of rails, and from these they advanced late in the p. m. and broke a portion of our line on the left, when the whole line gave way just before dark and retreated. The enemy's cavalry crossing Cedar Creek above the turnpike bridge, succeeded in cutting off and capturing most of our artillery and many wagons on Hupp's Hill after dark, the bridge near Spangler's Mill having in the meantime broken down and stopped the train. The troops marched all night and reached New Market on the 20th and went into their former camps, Rosser bringing up the rear. The enemy's cavalry followed slowly to Edenburg, where we had halted our cavalry (see plate ---+).

On the 21st the enemy's infantry came across Cedar Creek and took and fortified with great care a new position on Hupp's and the adjoining hills (see plate ---*). Lomax's division, which only came to the vicinity of Middletown on the 19th, fell back to Milford in the Page Valley, and took and fortified a strong position there (see plate ---#). All was quiet until the 26th, when the enemy's cavalry attacked Lomax's position at Milford and was repulsed. Rosser's brigade on that day went from its camp near Timberville to Luray. The troops remained quietly in camp in the vicinity of New Market, holding the line of Stony Creek and the position at Milford with cavalry, at points east of the Blue Ridge, until the 10th of November, when they again marched
