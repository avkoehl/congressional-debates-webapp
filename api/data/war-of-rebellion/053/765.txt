Fort Deposit there are two small boats, capacity for 8 horses; there are two at Fletcher's Ferry, will cross 30 horses on both; two at Decatur and three at private ferries above, will average about 10 horses; and one at Brown's Ferry.

There are no fords passable now, and will not be again this winter, without some very unusual weather. Boats can be speedily built at many places on and near the river, especially up Elk River. I have made no guess at the enemy's strength or probable moves from Huntsville, but hope to give you some definite information very soon. Many citizens near the railroad seem to think they are moving forces from Chattanooga toward Murfreesborough. My horses are in a terrible condition for want of shoes and with sore backs. Men generally in good health. Sent all prisoners to Decatur yesterday.

Very truly,

P. D. RODDEY,

Brigadier-General.
