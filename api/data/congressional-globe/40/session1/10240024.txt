It was a maxim of ancient jurisprudence that a
slave had not any country of his own; he acquired
with his liberty an admission into the political soci-
ety of which his patron was a member."—1 Gibbons
Home, eh. 2, p. 46.
r, :V;V}drew Johnson, in his Nashville speech of June
9,1864, is,thus reported:
"But in calling a convention to restore tho State
who shall restore and reestablish it? Shall the man
who gavo his influence and his means to destroy the
(government? Ishe to participate in the great work
ot reorganization ? Shall he who brought this mis-
ery upon the State be permitted to control its desti-
nies ? If this be so, then all this precious blood of our
brave soldiers and officers so finely poured out will
have been wantonly spilled, all the glorious victo-
rios won by our noble armies will go for nought, and
all the battle-fields which have been sown with dead
heroes during the rebellion will have been made mem-
orable in vain.^
"Why all this carnage and devastation? It was
that treason might be put down and traitors pun-
ished. .Therefore I say that traitors should take a
back seat in the work of restoration. If there be but
five thousand men in Tennessee loyal to the Consti-
tution, loyal to freedom, loyal to justice, these true
and iaithful men should control the work of reorgan-
ization and leformation absolutely. I say that the
traitor has ceased to be a citizen, and in joining the
rebellion has become a public enemy. He forfeited
his right to yote with loyal men when he renounced
his citizenship and sought to destroy our Government.
We say to the most honest and industrious foreigner
who comes from England or Germany to dwell among
u9 and to odd to the wealth of the country, 'Before
you can be a citizen youmuststay here for five years.'
if we are so cautious about foreigners, who volunta-
rily renouncethcir homes to live with us, what should
we say to tho traitor, who, although born and reared
among us, has raieed a parricidal hand against the
Government which always protected him? My judg-
ment is that he should besubjected to a severe ordeal
before he is restored to citizenship. A fellow who
takes the oath merely to save his property and denies
the validity of thcoath is a perjured man, and notto
be trusted. 35efore these repenting rebels can be
trusted let them bring forth the fruits of repentance.
He who helped to make all these widows and orphans
who draped the streets of Nashville in mourning,
should suffer for his great crime. The work is in our
own hands. We can destroy this rebellion. With
Grant thundering on the Potomac before Richmond
and Sherman and Thomas on their march toward
Atlanta, theday will ere long be ours. Will any madly
persist in rebellion ? Suppose that an equal number
be slain in every battle, it is plain that the result
must be the utter extermination of the rebels. Ah I
these rebel leaders have a strong personal reason for
holding out, to save their necks from the halter; and
these leaders must feel the power of the Government,
lreason must be made odious, and traitors must be
punished and impoverished. Their great plantations
must be seized and divided into small farms, and sold
h,one,st> industrious men. The day for protecting
the lands and negroes of these authors of the rebel-
lion is past. It is high time it was. I have been
most deeply pained at some things which have come
under my observation. We get men in command*
wno, under the influenco of flattery, fawning, and?
caressing, grant protection to the rich traitor, whilo
tne poor Union man stands out in thecold. often un-
* v™0 a or a voucher for his losses. [Cries
r s s0* ^rt>in P^rts of the crowd.!"
Lp his remarks at an interview with citi'zens of
Indiana, April 21, 1865, he said:
I hold it as a&oloiim obligation in any one of these
