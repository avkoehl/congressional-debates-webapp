Mr. GILMER asked that the resolution might be lead for in-

So the inst) ucttons were rejected
The SPEAKER then called for petitions and memorials un-
der the suspension of the rules of Friday last, the call having
yet reached only to tho State of Kentucky
Whereupon, Mi BOYD rose and presented a petition pray
log for the repeal of the Bankrupt law, which he moved to
refer to the Committee on theJudiciaiy with the following in
struction1:?
That the said memorial "be referred to the Committee on
the Judiciary, with instructions to report on this day, at 2
o'cock, in execution of an order of the House made on the 8th
instant, a bill for the repeal of act entitled 'A n aet to establish a
uniform system < f bankruptcy throughout the United States,' "
approved August 19 1841
Mr B moved the previous question before taking this seat,
and again, after the instructions had been read, lose and made
that motion
Mr WELLER, also, (not hearing, as the Reporter supposes,
the motion of Mr Boyd ) rose and moved the previous ques
tion
Some conversation rose between- Mr GUANGER and the
SPEAKER on a point of order, but nothing of it reached the
ear of the Reporter
Mi CUSHtlSG then rose and said, I propose to debate this
petition and instructions That will settle the point of order—
the ques'ion must he over
[( ríes of " You cannot debate it—the previous question has
been called "]
And the SPEAKER derided thatthe previous question having
been called, the gentleman from Massachusetts could not debate
the subject
Mr THOMPSON of Mississippi called for the i eadmg of the
instructions which were read
Mr W1NTHROP moved that the petition and instructions
be laid on the table
Mr BOYD asked the >eas and nays on that motion, which
wei e ordered
Mr W W IRWIN rose to a point of order The sentlermn
from Kentucky, fMr Po'íd lifhe (Mr I ) wis not mistaken,
had presented a petition and had followed it up with mstruc
tions—and befoie the Chin had announced the instructions,
the gentleman had moved the previous question Was that in
ordeifí
The SPEAKER said yes it was a course of proceeding sus
tamed by thepiecedents of the House
Mr BOYD rose to conect the gentleman as to a matter of
fact He did call foi the previous question on the presentation
of thepetition but he a'so called for it again upon the an
n uncesnent-oft e petition by the Chair
The SPEAKTR tepeated that this course of proceeding was
m acconlanre with piecedent
Mr C OLES called foi the reading of the instruction0, which
were agun read
Mr BARNARD here r^se to a po nt of order, which
howevei, (after a bnef conversation with the Speaker,"  he
withdrew
M ) WHLIAMS rose toa point of order Ilewasundei
stooil to say (though scircely heaid) that there was a rule of
ih° Jfouse which required that all the committees should be call
ed foi reports at a cei tarn specified time And there was anothei
rule which provided noromm'ttee shall sit during the sitting
of the House, without special leave This rule was infringed

ousine^    P was too late to iai*ethe point of order
Mi BO"\ D sil 1 if the centleman from Mass=achupe*ts would
iPnw him, he wouVl a am explain his motion He rose he
said m his place andofered a petit on praying for the iepeal
of the Bankrupt 'aw, and at the «same time he offered a resolu
tion of instruction to the Committee on the Judiciary after
which, and before taking his seat, he moved the previous que 
tion He then took his seat, an1 the petition and iesojs|iGna
were announced by the Chair, and'ihe latter read to iHfe HMuia
by the Clerk Upon this he again rose and moved the píteos
question In short, it waa after the petitioh had fy&h reeelved,
after the lesolution had been read, and the quesüOnefetíed ón it
by the Chair
The SPEAKER said it was too late now for the ftentfemari
from Massachusetts [Mr Cu^hikg] to raise the question af re-
ception In (he decision which the Chair had made, hfrhad
been guided by the precedents of the House, in cases a!  to the
decision of which he was not responsible It had been decided,
over and over again, that the mover of a petition could call
the previous question uponit.
Mr W W IRWIN Does the Speaker assert that he an-
nounced the reception of the petition, and the motion of instruc-
tions of the gentleman from Kentucky, [Mr Boyd,] befoie the
call for the previous question?
The SPEAKER said it was not the duty of the Chair to an-
nounce the petition The parliamentary lav  presumed ape«
tition to be received by unanimous consent, unless objection,
was made, and the question of reception raised                        *
Mr BOWNE    Is this debate m orderl
The SPEAKER    No, it is not
Mr i USHING In order that the House may see this ques
tion, and understand the consequences of this decision, I feel
constrained to take an appeal from the decision of the Chair
And on that I wish to he heard
The SPEAKER. The gentleman cannot be heard The pre-
vious question has been -demanded, and there is a motion pend-
ing to lay the whole subject on the table                                  $
Mr CÜ3HING I understand the Speaker to have decided
that a memorial being presented, and the moverof that memo
rial offering a resolutien of instructions to acomrmtt^e, and the
previous question having been called, without any other gen-
tleman having an opportunity to rise and make objection, itia
too late to make the question of reception If thatis the deci-
sion of the Chair, I say, I appeal from it
The SPEAKER T he Chair has so decided, and was Com
pelled so to decide, under the precedents of the House
So the question was on the appeal
Mr LbWIS WILLIAMS asked the yeas and nays thereon;
which were refused
Mr THOMPSON of Mississippi Have I undeistood the
Speaker as saying that the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr
Lushing] could notstatethe grounds of his appeal?
The SPEAKER If the gentleman from Miss ssippi [Mr
Thompson] will look at the 46th rule, he will see that the Chair
had no alternative    The language of the rule is as follows
"On a previous question there shall be no debate    Ail mci
dental questions of order, arising after a motion is made for the
previous question and pending such motion, shall be decided*'
whether on appeal or otherwise, without debate '*
Mr WISE made a statement of his understanding of the fact^
of the case
The SPEAKER gave authorities for his decision—a deci-
sion, he said, which had been made in more than twenty
ca=ps
Mr EES3ENDEN made an inquiry of the Chair, not heaid
by the Reporter
Mr McKEON rose, and was reading nora apapei before him
a statement of fact or of the question of order
Mr BOWNE objected, saying it was a mere matter of argu-
ment                                                        ,
Mr McKEON was proceeding to read—
The SPEAKER said the gent eman from New York [Mr
McKeon] was not m order If the gentleman wanted to hear
the grounds of thewdensioo the Chair would give them to him.
[Great confusion and uproar ]
Mi McKEON sat down
Mr SPRIGG wanted to know what the question was?
Mr HOW \RD of Michigan asked the Speaker to state the
point of order?
The SPEAKER said he would do so
Ihe gentleman from Kentucky [Mr Boyd] presented apeti*
tion praying for the repeal of the Bankiupt law He then pre-
sented instructions to tne Houee ordeiiog the Commitue on the
Judiciary to íeporta bill m conformity with the | rayerof that
petition and, upon these instructions, the gentleman demanded
the previous question The gentleman from Massachusetts
[Mr Winthrop] then rope ard moved to lay the peutionand
mstiucnons on the table The gentleman from Massachusetts
on thei ght of the Chair, [Mr Lusmr,G]ihen i ose to a point
of older which was, tiidi the Chai>-should not have entertained
the motion for the pieviousquesnon
Mr PUSHING    Piat is not the btale of the question

The SPEAKER continued The Chair was about to state
