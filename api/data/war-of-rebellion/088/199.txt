HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,August 15, 1864. (Received 5.45 p. m.)

General GRANT:

A prisoner just sent in reports that his division of cavalry, W. H. F. Lee's, arrived here this morning, having left Reams' Station at 11 a. m. yesterday-Barringer's, Chambliss', and Dearing's brigades. We have forced the enemy back beyond the cross-roads on the Charles City road, but so far only to the intrenchments occupied by Gregg early this morning. The enemy's works appear well filled. General Birney is still operating between the Central and Charles City roads, and if he finds a weak place a strong attack will be made. I expect to hear of it before long.

W. S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

(Same to General Meade.)
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,August 15, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Your dispatches received. I am much obliged to you for the appointment of brigadier-general in the Regular Army. I am also obliged to you for being so anxious to-day, for I am not satisfied with our progress here.

W. S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,August 15, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Everything is quiet here. General Birney did not attack to-night, not having encountered the enemy's skirmishers until about dark. He lost thirty or forty men, the greater number colored, in his observations. I have ordered a movement on the Charles City road, under General Miles, at daylight. General Birney will also move toward the Central road at the same hour, prepared to make a heavy attack if possible. The cavalry will operate on the Charles City road and to the right. General Gregg captured a few prisoners this evening, all from W. H. F. Lee's division. I have no evidence indicating any grater strength than before.

W. S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

General B. F. BUTLER:

GENERAL: There is nothing new here. I am well out on the Charles City and Central roads. The days has been consumed in affairs with cavalry and in reconnaissance. To-morrow morning at daylight I hope to commence more serious work.

W. S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
