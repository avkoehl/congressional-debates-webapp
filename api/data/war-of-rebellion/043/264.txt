command in the late action was seven. Two, however, of the seven were again lost-one by the party capturing the colors being again captured, and one taken from the private who captured it by some unknown colonel. There have been buried, in front of this command, up to this date, but 4 officers and 103 enlisted men of the enemy's dead. This arises from the want of tools, which were all taken from the corps in the action of the 1st instant. The entire command is supplied with 60 rounds of ammunition per man, and three days' rations from this a. m. Artillery ammunition report inclosed. *

I am, general, very respectfully, &c.,
