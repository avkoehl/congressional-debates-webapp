his arrival. The force for Galveston will get off as soon as the vessels ordered by the Quartermaster-General arrive. Steele's expedition will absorb everything that is seaworthy. Sabine Pass and Matagorda have been abandoned by the rebels, and it is reported that the Texas troops have generally disbanded themselves and gone to their homes, plundering the public stores before they left. The Missouri and Arkansas troops have retained their organizations and will protect the public property until it is formally turned over.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

General Buckner estimates the number of troops to be paroled in the Trans-Mississippi Department at 38,000. If the number exceeds the estimate in the same proportion that it did in Taylor's command it will probably reach 100,000. The commissioners and the staff officers to take charge of the surrendered property went up to-day with the troops that are to garrison Alexandria, Shreveport, and Monroe, La., and Marshall, Tex.

Major General E. R. S. CANBY:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inform you that the Texan forts, Mannahasset and Griffin, commanding the approaches to Sabine Pass, have been evacuated after spiking the guns. The U. S. flag was raised by the commander of the Owasco, gun-boat. Griffin has five bombproofs and five guns. Bomb-proofs covered with two feet solid timber, two layers of railroad iron, and four feet of earth on top. Four magazines are constructed in like manner. Mannahasset mounts four guns. These forts could not be occupied for want of sufficient men. The Stonewall surrendered to the Spanish authorities on the 20th instant, after a summons from Admiral Stripling from his fleet.

Very respectfully,

H. K. THATCHER,

Acting Rear-Admiral.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, May 31, 1865.

Admiral H. K. THATCHER,

Very respectfully, you obedient servant,

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
