Colonel HARDING:

I have just got in. My men are all well, but one of Company D had a congestive chill. I found no considerable force of bushwhackers, not above a half dozen. Could not overtake those I did see. Will make a full report in writing on in person soon. Will be up Thursday, and will be able to make some suggestions that will be worthy of consideration. Captain Ogle and the adjutant have arrived.

Your, truly,

B. K. DAVIS,

Major, Commanding.

P. S. - Please signify if you wish to see me sooner than Thursday.
