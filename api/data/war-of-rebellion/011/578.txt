General RUGGLES, Grenada:

General V, is still at Fort Pillow with small force of cavalry. No force here. Troops passed down the river to Vicksburg.

Latest from Junction:; No enemy had crossed Hatchie up to 12 last evening. I do not now believe that I will be able to hold 50 men in arms here. The Home Battalion intend to remain here, and hence they are not going to help fight or defend. Ten citizens volunteered yesterday.

THOS. H. ROSSER,

Colonel, Commanding Post.

GRENADA, June 3, [1862]-9.30 a.m.

Brigadier-General VILLEPIGUE,

Commanding Forces, Memphis:

I want a force at Hernando to cover Memphis:

You will please occupy that place, or such better point as you may select, with your troops unless your previous orders render it inexpedient.

Please answer at once.

DANIEL RUGGLES.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Grenada, June 3, [1862]

Brigadier-General VILLEPIGUE, Memphis:

I wish you to take command at Memphis, and hold your forces in such position as to cover it and contribute to its defense. This is on the presumption that your previous orders do not conflict and that you have evacuated Fort Pillow.

The new gunboat Arkansas will reach Memphis in a few days to join the cotton gunboat fleet.

I hope to be in Memphis to-morrow morning.

Can you furnish some heavy guns for Memphis?

Answer.

DANIEL RUGGLES

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

General DANIEL RUGGLES, Grenada:

If not already done, for God's sake, order the River Defense Fleet to defend every bend and dispute every mile of river from Pillow here.

I am willing, and believe I am able, to hold the river, if Commodore Montgomery will co-operate, which I believe he will.

M. JEFF. THOMPSON.

General RUGGLES:

Without it was a strategic movement it was useless to evacuate Fort Pillow.
