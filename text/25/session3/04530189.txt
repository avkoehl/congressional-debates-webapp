25th Cong....3d Sess.
Interference in Elections—Mr. Roane.
Senate.
ha\e differed with him then witn the same cordi-
ality with which he now concuis with me.
But, sir, a difference with the Administration
on this great subject has not for a moment indi-
cated that it was my duty to oppose it out and
out, and affiliate myself with those who avow
" uncompromising hostility to Martin Van Buren "
No, sir, I have gone on steadily to give to his
admimstiation an honest and a conscientious sup-
poit, and let me add, su, that as long as I shall
remain here, and^the Piesident shall advocate the
true punciples of the Constitution and republican
doctrines, as he has thus far done, that support
will be continued with unabated zeal and pleas-
ure Does this, su, define my position ? No, sir,
not as fully as I desire My colleague, who has
fiom time to time, and little by little, " defined
his position" towards this Administration, and
recently in a manner which none here present
doubt or misunderstand, was with me, or rather
I should say I was with him, as far as I had an
opportunity to know, (and I had many,) m every
thought and feeling, during the late warmly con-
tested presidential election, and,for the life of me,
I cannot see why it is that we are now so wide
apart m those thoughts and feelings about the
Admimstiation and administrators of the Gov-
ernment. I know of no public reasons for this
difference, and much less of any private ones
But, sir, either I or my colleague have entirely
changed our positions, since we were sent hithei,
and I am reluctantly driven to put myself upon
my country, to say whether it is I who have
changed, as is roundly charged by my colleague
upon all the friends of the Administration
Mr President, before I came here as a Senator,
I was personally unacquainted with Martm Van
Buren My colleague knew him intimately, he
had seived with him in public life, he had stood
shoulder to shoulder with him in this Chamber,
in resisting the powerful and combined assaults
which were made on the great measures of Jack
son's administration, he had zealously supported
his election to the Presidency, he had voted for
me as one of the electors of Virginia, substan-
tially pledged to vote for him, and I have no hes-
itation in saying, that amidst all the foul charges
brought against this then personal stranger to
me, the support which my colleague thus gave
him strengthened my confidence in the correct-
ness of the vote I had given for him at the polls,
and afterwards bestowed upon him as a member
of the electoral college On my arrival heie as a
Senator, I determined to endeavor, during my
stay in this city, to form a personal acquaintance
•with the President, and to judge for myself in re-
gard to the many charges which had been brought
against him Accident has affoided me a fullei
opportunity for this investigation than I could
have anticipated, and, sir, I have scanned, with
a scrutinizing tye, as far as my pooi abilities
would enable me, the character, opinions, and
conduct of the man I have, sir, when " the
curtain of ceremony was drawn to the skies,"
and when it was utterly impossible for him to
know the operations of my mind, " tented him
to the quick " I have looked, but looked in
vain, sir, for all those leading characteristic traits
non committalism and management and intrigue
and " mighty magic," wherewithal he was so
loudly charged I believe, sir, that his first mes-
sage to the Congress of the United States has
hushed forever all the croakmgs about his non-
committalism, and that all the slang about his
magic arts ceased as soon as it was found pow-
erless to dupe and deceive the people
Does any one pretend that the President has
as yet violated any of the principles which those
who elected, expected him to maintain' Let the
continued, the untiring and remoreless opposition
of the far greater part of those who opposed his
election answer the question, let those of them
who now give either the cold, reluctant approba-
tion of silence, or are willing to receive, as a
"goodhalf way house," the once by them denounced
and reviled " pet bank " " experiment," answer
the question And how is it, why is it, that I
find my colleague now pulling kindly in the traces
with these gentlemen, and charging upon the
President duplicity and deception1) But, sir, he
says he was the fi lend—the bestfuend—o/the Pres-
ident, for that he advised him beforehand—nay,
sir, he teamed him—not to recommend to Con-
gress his scheme of a sub-Treasuiy Ay, sir,
lie advised the President, and he did not follow
his advice, he warned him, and he did not heed
his warning, but went on to discharge his high
duty according to the dictates of his own judg
ment and conscience
Sir, suppose that some kind friend, (and would
that he could have found such a one,) knowing
or suspecting that my colleague intended to recom-
mend to Congress his favonte" pet bank scheme,"
had gone to him and told him that it was an ex-
ploded experiment, that it had been already fully
and fairly tued, and, in his own impiessive lan-
guage ," had signally and mournfully failed," and
advised and warned him not to submit it, and
that, notwithstanding all this, he thought it his
duty to do as he did, and propose it to the na-
tion does he think that that friend should have
manifested towards him the feeling and temper
which he, on all occasions, now evinces towards
the President ?
My colleague has opposed all and every scheme
thought of foi the custody and disbursement of
the public money, except the one which he intro-
duced, which has notoriously met with less favor
in Congress and elsewhere than any othei yet
suggested He condemns, with unmeasuied cen-
sure, the President for again recommending to
the consideiation of Congress a financial plan,
which, my colleague says, has been repudiated
by the voice of Congress and the nation He
knows that the people have not yet finally or
fully passed upon that plan He knows that it
has twice received the sanction of this body, and
each time been defeated by a small majority in
the other House of Congress, and yet, strange
to tell, he who urges this objection to the Presi-
dent's plan, thus sustained, is perpetually press
ing on Congress and the nation a scheme which,
besides himself, finds but one supporter in the
Senate, and íery few, indeed, in the other House
of Congress, or elsewhere—as though his plan
had been less íepudiated by the nation than the
one submitted by the President, or the President
of the United States was less authorized than he
to " recommendto the consideration of Congiess such
measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient "
My colleague is opposed to the Bank of the Uni-
ted States, because, I presume, it is unconstitu
tional He is opposed to the sub Treasury, be
cause it will increase Executive patronage, because
it will create two currencies-~-one for the people, the
othei (the best) for the office holdcis ' and, I sup-
pose, because he advised and warned the Piesi-
dent not to recommend it, and as to a special
deposit scheme, he says that is all a humbug
Nothing, sir, nothing but his own deal scheme of
" State rights banks," 01 " bank State rights,"
I forget which he called it, will do for him, and
I am fiee to say that, after the fullest attention I
have been able to bestow upon all that he has said
m favor of this his darling pet, I can distill from
it nothing more than this that having, on the
emergency occasioned by the removal oí the de
posits in 1834 from the Bank of the United States,
voted for the experiment of the State banks as
fiscal agents, he is consistent in voting for them
again Yes, sir, every change has been rung on
the inconsistency of those who voted for them
then, and now, that they have " signaHy and
mournfully" failed to answer the desired purpose,
are opposed to trusting them a second time, whilst
1 have heard from my colleague not a woid of
reproof against those who then denounced his
scheme as fraught with corruption and luin to
the country, and now " damn it with faint praise,"
or stigmatize it as " a good half-way house "
Half way where> half nay to what> Why, sir,
halfway between that constitutional Treasury and
that unconstitutional bank, between which, my
colleague says, he would pause long before he
would make an election '
Mr President, I beg leave further to define my
position, by saving that every day's reflection
and observation—nay, that " recent events," if
my colleague prefers the phrase—confiim me in
my conviction that the money of the people paid
for the support of their Go\ernment, and no
othei puipose, should be kept in a Tieasury in
dependent of, and uncontrolled by, any other
Government, or the creatures of any other Gov-
ernment on earth, and that I will try every pos-
sible, feasible scheme which wise, patriotic states-
men can devise, before I will confide the public
tieasure—the taxes paid and intended by the
people for specific purposes—to the uncontrolled,
custody (as uncontrolled it must be, for I agree
with my colleague that a general scheme of
special deposits is all a humbug) of any bank;
and least of all of banks who owe their existence
and allegiance to other Governments, and whom
we cannot, therefore, supervise, regulate, control,
or punish. If you cannot exercise these powei á
ínregaid to these banks, when curators of the
the public money, it seems most clear to my
mind that it should not be intrusted to them, and
if you can, it is equally clear that we may bid an
eternal adieu to all State rights, except what ray
colleague is pleased to denominate " bank State
rights " Par be it from me, sir, now to go into
anything like an argument in íavor of the sub-
Treasury That task has long since been ably
performed by others. Its principles are before
the people, and, like the punciples of constitu-
tional liberty and reform on othei great occasions,
may be slow, but will be sure It has always
been sufficient for me that the system is support-
ed by the plain punciples of common sense and
common honesty, and is notoriously the only
mode contemplated by the framers of the Con-
stitution, who denied to the Government the aid
of a national bank, and theiefore could not have
contemplated or anticipated that of State banks
in conjunction with the national Treasury
Turther, sn, to define my position, m contra-
distinction to that of my colltague,and that which
he now occupies m contradistinction to the one
he occupied a few yeais ago, I beg leave to read
to the Senate an extract or two from a speech de-
hveied by him in this Chamber in the year 1834,
on the occasion of the lemoval of the deposits 1
know, sir, that efforts have been íecenth made to
explain away that spLech to mean something very
different fiom what its words cleaily import It
he has not, since that speech was delivered,
changed his opinion and shifted his giound, then
indeed, is language a most imperfect exponent oí
thought /ceilainly have not changed my opin
ions on the subject of that speech—it was about
gold cuucncy I shall never forget the pleasure
with which 1 read it, and what golden opinions it
obtiined foi my colleague with the entire Democ-
racy of Virginia, oi what heavy denunciations l'
brought upon him from those with whom he is
now coopeiating to make this a bank-paper Gov-
ernment    But to the extiacts     He then said.

Can language possibly be more plain, intelli-

this part of that memorable speech of my col-
league, I thought of John Randolph, whos.e
dulcet and peculiar tones of voice, metlunks, Í
can still hear ringing in my ears " This is a
hard money Government—give me gold and silver
—none of your trash—none of your rags—none
of your paper money " These were the senti-
