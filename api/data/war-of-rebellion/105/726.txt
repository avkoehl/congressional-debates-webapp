remainder I have ordered to be kept for absolute use. Also the acting assistant quartermaster informs me that but some sevent blankets are invoiced to him. That number of blankets is not enough. The men should have at least one pair of blankets in this climate. Without blankets I am afraid that the men will be laid up with rheumatism. The transportation will be sufficient without employing Baning's teams.

Very respectfully,
