PRANKING.
I have twice in my annual reports called
attention to the gross abuses of the franking
privilege. It becomes my duty again to speak
of the frauds perpetrated upon the revenues of
the Post Office Department by these abuse's.
I have had occasion frequently during the past
year to call the attention of members of Con-
gress to the use of their names in sending
mailable matter free under a fae simile frank.
Three dollars will buy the. fac simile frank of
any member of Congress, and the use of it by
claim agents and business men in cities iu
Bending books, periodicals, letters, and busi-
ness circulars defrauds the Department out of
immense sums of money. It is estimated that
the loss to the Department by this species of
abuse of the franking privilege has amounted
to from one million to one million and a half
dollars during the past year. On former occa-
sions I have urged, in order to avoid the con-
tinuance of this serious cheat in the use of
names of members of Congress without their
knowledge or consent, that the law be so
changed as to require the written signature of
the person exercising the franking privilege
upon the matter franked; and to relieve the'
heads of Departments and bureaus of great
labor, that a franking clerk be authorized by
law for each Department of the Government,
with the right to frank all matter pertaining to
the Department for which he is so appointed;
and to relieve members of Congress from great
labor and care, that one or more franking clerks
be appointed for each House of Congress to
frank such letters and public documents as it
is desirable to send free through the mails. I
have thus far failed to secure any attention to
these urgent appeals, and am becoming satis-
fied that the only way to avoid an abuse which
is becoming systematized and which is so se-
vere a tax upon the revenues of the Depart-
ment is to abolish the franking privilege alto-
POST OFFICES IS BOSTON AND NEW YORK.
In tho city of Boston the Government has
purchased, for a large sum of money, a very
valuable site for a post office and for revenue
offices. It is of very great importance, both
to the postal and revenue service, that at as
early a day as possible plans for buildings
should be adopted and appropriations made to
erect them. There is no occasion for any
delay, and every reason that economy and
public necessity can suggest why the work
should go impiediately forward. Boston is the
capital of New England, and the Government
ought to erect public buildings there which
would gratify the pride of that people and do
honor to itself.
I must again urge that steps be immediately
taken to erect a suitable post office in the city
of New York. A most eligible site has been
purchased there for this purpose. The neces-
sities of the public service demand that there
shall be no further delay in this case. The
building now occupied for a post office is what
is left of an old church. It is patched and bat-
tered, full of dark corners and discomforts.
The sunlight can scarcely penetrate its gloomy
interior. Gas is burnt there day and night,
and men work by it. It is over an old grave-
yard, and under its rotten floors lie skulls and
bones, and the damp mold of dead men. On
removing the floors for repairs, a short time
ago, these unwelcome sights were exposed to
view. The building is unfit for any use what-
ever ; yet there, in summer and winter, in heat
and cold, by gaslight, from night until morning
and from morning until night, three hundred
men are at work for the people of the whole
United States, and inhaling a poisoned atmos-
phere every breath they draw. It is § disgrace
to the city: of JfewYork and a disgrace to the
nation. An average of nearly thirty men are
sick all the time from laboring in that unwhole-
some place. The Post Office Department pays
every year for extra help on account of it,asum
equal to the interest on half a million dollars. It
is not always that the commercial and moneyed
center of a nation is the same. But the . city of
New York is both the moneyed and.commarcial
center of the western hemisphere. In fiftyyears
it may be the moneyed penter and commercial
center of the .world. In less than twenty .-years
the city will contain a population of at least
three million people—a population,, equal'to
that of all the Colonies at the date of tiie. Revo-
lution. It is time now to begin to do some-
thing to meet its growing necessities. The
post office building is unsafe. It is liable at any
time to burn down, and scarcely a day passes
but there goes through that office, in money,
drafts, and securities, from ten to thirty million
dollars in value. To erect suitable public build-
ings there is the nation's work, and the nation's
representatives ought to attend to it.
In the year 1854 the deficiency of the Depart-
ment, as between revenues and expenditures,
was $1,621,837 90 ; in the year 1855 the defi-
ciency was $2,626,206 16 ; in the year 1856 it
was $2,787,046 "50 ; in the year 1857 ;it .was
$3,453,718 40; in the year 1858 it was $4,-
543,843 70; in the year 1859 it was-$6,996,-
009 26; in the year 1860 it-was $5,656,705 49 ;
in the year 1861 it was $4,557,462 71; in the
year 1862, it was $2,112,814 57; in the year
1863 it was $150,417 25 ; in the year 1864 it
" ,532 42 ; in the year 1865 there was
a surplus of revenues over expenditures of
*$861,430 42 ; in the year 1866 the excess of
expenditures over revenues left a .deficiency
of $965,093 09, making the expenditures for
the year ending June 30, 1866, $1,826,523 57
greater than for the year ending June 30, 1865.
Tho years 1865 and 1866 above mentioned were
the two years in which the Department was
administered by my immediate predecessor.
The deficiency for the year ending June 80,
1867, was $1,906,789 92, including.as revenue
$900,000 drawn under acts making appropria-
tions for carrying free mail matter, and not
including as expenditure $1,191,666 67 paid
for service for which special appropriation was
made.
The actual difference between revenues inde-
pendent of special appropriations and expend-
itures, including special appropriations, was
$3,998,456 59.
The revenues independent of special appro-
priations, for the year ending June 30, 1868,
were $16,292,600 80; and the expenditures
including service for which special appropria-
tions were made, were $22,730,592 65, showing
an excess of expenditures of $6,437,991 85.
To meet this deficiency there were drawn under
appropriations made for carrying free matter
$3,800,000, and under acts making special
appropriations for overland mail and marine
service between New York and California,
$1,125,000; steamship service between San
Francisco, Japan, and China, $125,000; be-
tween the United States and Brazil, $150,000;
for carrying mail on routes established by acts
passed during the first session of the Thirty-
Ninth Congress, $486,525; and for preparing
and publishingpost-routemaps, $10,000; leav-
ing a deficiency, as stated in the first part of
this report, for the year ending June 80,1868,
of $741,466 85.
It is seen from the foregoing statement of
receipts, expenditures, and appropriations that
in supplying necessary postal accommodations
for the people the excess of expenditures over
revenues rapidly increased from 1854 to 1859
and 1860, inclusive; the deficiency for 1859
being $6,996,009 26, and for the year 1860
being$5,656,705 49. After the year I860 the
expensive service in the southern States began
rapidly to diminish, until in the year 1865therq
was so little mail service performed ia the
States involved in the rebellion that the reve-
nues exceeded the expenditures by $861,430 42.
The service was almost entirely suspended.
Directly after the war ended and during the
second year of the administration of my im-
mediate predecessor, ending June 30, 1866,
the Postmaster General entered upon the se-
rious task of restoring the service in the insur-
gent States. In the States of Virginia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida,
Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas,
Louisiana, and Texas the service was restored
during the year ending June 30, 1866, to an
extent costing $1,086,527. . .
In the same States the cost of service for
the year ending June 30, 1867, increased to
$1,891,531, and for the year ending June 30,
1868, it increased to the sum of $2,168,459.
This expenditure was for transportation alone,
and include none of the other large expenses
necessarily connected with the postal service
in those States.
Before the rebellion, and in times of ordi-
nary prosperity, the excess of expenditures over
the revenues of the Department was nearly
$7,000,000. The almost total abandonment
of the service in the southern States, and the
rapid increase of revenue growing out,of the
remarkable increase of correspondence con-
nected with the Army and Army operations,
and of domestic correspondence between sol-
diers and their families and friends, soon
brought expenses and revenues near together,
and in the year ending June-SO, 1865, left an
unexpended balance in the Treasury, as before
stated.
In the year ending June -30, 1865, the aggre-
gate length of routes was 142,340 miles, and
the annual transportation reduced to 57,998,694
miles.
During the year ending June 30, 1866, the
aggregate length of routes had increased to
180,921 miles, and the annual transportation
to 71,837,914 miles, an increase of 38,581
miles in length of routes, and of 13,844,220
miles in annual transportation.
During the year ending June 30, 1867, the
aggregate length of routes had increased to
202,245 miles, and the annual transportation
to 78,982,789 miles, an increase of 21,324
miles in length of routes, and an increase in
transportation of 7,144,875 miles over the pre-
vious year.
During the year ending June SO, 1868, the
aggregate length of routes increased to 216,928
miles, and the annual transportation increased
to 84,224,325 miles, an increase of 14,683 miles
in length of routes, and 5,241,516 miles in
annual transportation.
Since the SOth day of June, 1865, and to the
1st day of July, 1868, three years, the aggre-
gate length of mail routes has increased 74,588
miles, and the annual transportation has in-
creased 26,230,631 miles.
Since I came to the head of the Post Office
Department, in July, 1866, after the close of
my immediate predecessor's second and last
year as Postmaster General, the aggregate
length of mail routes put under contract and
in actual operation up to the 1st day of July,
1868, is 36,008 miles, and the increase of an-
nual transportation for the time increased
12,886,411 miles.
The increase of serviee and great increase
of the expenses of the Department for inland
mail transportation have not all arisen from,
the restoration of mail service in the late dis-
ordered States. A large amount of the service
in operation previous to the war, and discon-
tinued during the war, has not yet been restored.
In addition to the increased and increasing
railroad transportation, with its increasing
expenses, Congress, by a series of acts, between
