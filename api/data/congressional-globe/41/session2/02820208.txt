giving bounty, she appropriating it. And now, "what
is the result ? If we suppose, for the sake of argu-
ment, that the tariff on iron and coal is added to the
cost, then Pennsylvaniareeeived a premium on her
production of iron and coal in 1868 of $14,859,168."
lias the gentleman a settled opinion on
the question, Is a protective duty a tax or
bounty? Or is he, like Bunsby, unable to give
an opinion for want of premises on which to
base it? " If so be," said Bunsby on a mem-
orable occasion, " as he's dead, my opinion is
he won't come back no more; if so be as he's
alive, my opinion is he will. Do I say he will?
No. Why not? Because the bearings "of this
observation lays in the application on it."
[Laughter.] '* If we suppose for the sake of
argument." A teacher of political economy
that has not yet made up his mind whether a
protecting duty is a tax or not comes here and
arraigns Pennsylvania, and holds her up to rid-
icule as a cormorant fattening upon public
bounty or plunder. But let me go on.
Mr. STEVENSON. Will the gentleman
give us his opinion upon that subject?
Mr. KELLEY. 1 have given it-, and I will
give it again.
protective duties not a tax.
Mr. Chairman, I apprehend that no enlight-
ened student of political oconomy regards a
protective duty as a tax. Even the gentleman
from Iowa [Mr. Allison] admitted that in
most eases it is not; yet influenced, as I think,
by a clever story which the chairman of our
committee, who is somewhat of a wag, tells,
he does not think the principle applies to
pig iron. 1 hope our chairman, who I see
does me the honor to listen, will pardon me
for referring to the anecdote. It runs thus:
some years ago, during the days of the Whig
party, when the chairman of the committee
[Mr. Schenck] was here as a Representative
of that party and a friend of protection, he met
as a member of this House a worthy old Ger-
man from Reading, Pennsylvania, a staunch
Democrat, but strongly in favor of protection
on iron. The gentleman _ from Ohio, who is
fond of a joke, said to him one day, "Mr.
It., I think 1 shall go with the free-traders on
the iron sections of the tariff bill, especially
on pig iron." "Why will you do that?" was
the response. " Well, my people want cheap
plows, nails, horseshoes, &c." "But," re-
plied the old German, " we make iron in Penn-
sylvania ; andifyou want to keep up the supply
and keep the price down you ought to encour-
age the manufacture." "But you know," said
our chairman, " that a protective duty is a tax,
and adds just that much to the cost of the ar-
ticle?" "Yes, I suppose it does generally
increase the cost of the thing just so much as
the duty is; all the leaders of our party say
so, and we say so in our convention platforms
and our public meeting resolutions; bat, Mr.
Schenck, somehow or other I think it don't
work just that way mit pig iron." [Laughter.]
The gentleman while admitting that protect-
ive duties do not always or even generally
increase the price of the manufactured article,
thinks "that somehow or other it don't work
that way mit pig iron." Now, I think that
iron in all its forms is subject to every gen-
eral law, and that the duty of $9 per ton o>n pig
iron has reduced the price measured in wheat,
wool, and other agricultural commodities and
increased the supply to such an extent as to
prove that the duty has been a boon and not a
tax. On nothing else produced in this country
has the influence of protection been so broadly
andbeneficently felt by the people of the country
at large.
On the 11th of January I submitted to the
House some remarks in the nature of a review
of the last report of CommissionerD. A. Well3,
and showed that after the production of Amer-
ican pig iron had been without increase for a
decade under the stimulus of this duty we more
than doubled it in six years. The authentic
figures I exhibited were as follows:

States from 1854 to 1862 inclusive.

185 4 3,069,838 716,674

1801 3,712,390 731,564
1862  3,943,469 787,662
The Morrill tariff, which raised the duty to
$6, went into effect in 1801. In 1864 the duty
was raised to $9. The results have been as
follows:

186 8  - 1,603,000
186 9  - 1,900,000
In connection with these figures I then in-
vited the attention of the House to the fact that
we built last year 65 furnaces in 15 States of
the Union, and that 58 more had been begun.
A few years more of such wonderful progress
and we will produce from our own coal and
iron our entire supply of iron and steel and com-
pete with England in supplying the demands of
the world. The vast demand created by the
extension of our railroad system, and those of
Russia and India, are exceeding the capacity of
England. She cannot largely increase her pro-
duction without largely increasingitscost. The
gentleman from Iowa was constrained to admit
yesterday that the price ofEnglish iron has gone
up steadily during the last year, because the de-
mand is in excess of her capacity to produce;
yet the price of American pig iron has fallen at
least $6 per toil on all grades within the last 10
months. What is the cause of this reduction ?
Not British competition—and that is the only
possible competition—for the price of British
iron has risen. No, sir; the price of American
iron has gone down under domestic competi-
tion and the general depreciation of prices.
Keep your duty high enough to induce other
men to build furnaces and rolling-mills and
before 5 years you will find American iron
cheapened to the level of the markets of the
world, and that without a commensurate reduc-
tion of wages.
how the internal revenue can be dispensed
with.
But I return to my subject. The gentle-
man from Ohio asked from what eight sources
$130,000,000 of revenue can be derived. I
find I overstated the number required; but six
articles are necessary to give us all the income
we need this year from that source. Let me
state the receipts from these six sources dur-
ing the last year. They were as follows:
From distilled spirits  $45,026,401
From tobacco  23,430,709
From fermented liquors  6,099,879
From banks and bankers  3,335,516
From incomes  34,791,855
From stamps  16,420,710
§129,104,068
Sir, month by month, since the close of the
last fiscal year, the receipts from each of these
sources have been larger than those of the
corresponding month of last year. There is
a regular monthly increase in every item.
Retaining but these six sources of internal
revenue we can mitigate their exactions at
least by increasing the exemption from the
income tax or reducing the rate, and still
obtain an excess over the amount that is abso-
lutely required. I am in . favor of adopting
this course, and believe that in three years
more, or in five at most, we can wipe out all
our internal taxes except stamps and tobacco.
Mr. SCHENCK. And spirits.
Mr. KELLEY. No. I am anxious to make
spirits free as soon as we can. I would make
this change in the interests of the farmers of
the country. But I do not wish to run into a
digression, and will recur to this point. I pro-
ceed to invite the attention of the committee
to the cost of collecting the internal revenue.
In 1867 it was $8,982,686; in 1868, $9,327,301,
and in 1869, $7,218,610, requiring for the three
years the expenditure of $25,528,597. Why,
sir, its abolition would be equal to the pay-
ment of $133,000,000 of the public debt. We
hopetofundour interest-bearing deb t at an aver-
age of'4£per cent. This will save $18,000,000.
Before the end of this fiscal year there will be
in the Treasury $100,000,000 of our bonds, the
interest on which is $6,000,000 per annum,
which, with the other sum and the cost of col-
lecting the internal revenue, would make a
reduction of $32,500,000 in the annual expenses
of the G-overnment. If the bill under discus-
sion shall become a law We will, I believe,
although it lightens the burdens of the-people
at least $20,000,000 per annum, be able in five
year's to make even distilled spirits free, and
rely on stamps and the tax on tobacco.
the effect of protection on prices again.
The gentleman from Iowa said that pig iron
sells at $40 a ton and yields at least $15 profit.
I have the Iron Age, a paper of the highest
authority among dealers in iron and hardware,
and I do not find it puts it at the price named
by the gentleman. March 12 it quotes prices
at Philadelphia of American pig iron, No. 1,
for foundery use, as $83 50 to $34; No. 2,
foundery, $31 50 to $32; gray forge, $30 to
$31; white and mottled, $28 50 to $29. There
is some difference between these prices and
$40 ; and if the gentleman was as far out of the
way in the profits of iron-makers as in the cost
of iron he ha3 shown clearly enough that there is
no profit in making pig iron at this time. The
gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Gakfield] hands
me a still later paper, showing a further re-
duction. But every business man knows that
the price is receding under the rapid increase
of domestic competition.
The English people know what would be the
effect of the reduction of our duty. I hold in
my hand the annual circular of a leading iron
firm in London advising the English iron-mak-
ers of the state of the trade and the prospect
for this year. Let me read from this circular,
which I may say was evidently not intended
for American consumption :
" No. 58 Old Bkoad Street,
London, December 31,1869.
"Sik: Thishasbeenaprosperousyearfor theiron-
masters. Our monthly advice of exports will have
revealed the cause. Three countries alone—Russia,
India, and the United States—have purchased 940,000
tons of British rails. Under these unprecedented ex-
ports the price has ruled firm, and good Erie rails
are now.worth £6 15s. net.
" Coal and pig iron.—Over-production has kept
down the price; but at length the demand for pigs
appears to have overtaken the supply, and they are
firm at an advance of 5s. upon the year.
"Old rails have been largely used by rail-mills, and
have advanced 10s, also during the year.
"Wages have advanced over the whole mining
district. At a meeting in London this week the
Welsh iron-masters voted an advance of 10 per cent.
"Cost of the finished rails to the manufacturer is
thus settled. The buyer is, however, more interested
in the relation of supply to demand.
"The supply of railway bars has greatly increased;
many merchant bar-mil Is have taken to rails, and all
the mills have increased their make. This increased
product has, however, found ready sale, and will not
probably decrease.
"The demand for next year promises to be good.
Most of the mills have orders for three, and somo for
six months. Home railways must buy more largely
than in 1869. Indiawill also take moro rails. Russia
is not so eager a buyer as at this time last year. The
Government, however, continues to build roads for
commercial and military purposes, and while the
English investors retain their present partiality for
Kussian securities there will be no laek of money.
Xet with tho present out-turn a material reduction
of the American duty, or something equally (Signifi-
cant, is necessary to advance the priea abovo £7." ■
