as a spy by Major-General McCook. This man may have been dressed in citizen's clothing, as many of our men are from necessity, but he is a regular soldier of the Confederate Army, and was engaged in a legitimate duty. With this explanation I trust to learn he has been returned to his status as a prisoner of war.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, September 24, 1862-1 p. m.

Gov. F. H. PEIRPOINT, Wheeling, Va.:

I have not a man to spare from my command for Western Virginia. I have requested General Halleck to send troops there an doe promises to do so.

Major-General NELSON,

Commanding, &amp;c., Louisville, Ky.:

Send me Buell's last dispatch and keep me constantly informed as to his movements. Do you credit report that Morgan has left Cumberland Gap? Answer.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, September 24, 1862.

Major General WILLIAM NELSON, Louisville, Ky.:

GENERAL: If I understand matters Bragg is on the Bardstown road and Buell is on the Elizabethtown road, whence he can move via Salt River or shepherdsville if he desire, forming junction with you. If this be so, it seems to me your best course is to hold your position at Louisville, being ready for any contingency. Buell ought to move as rapidly as Bragg; if so, the latter will hardly trouble you. I have reduced the force already further than is prudent, and shall send no more unless indispensable to your safety. Smith may turn on Cincinnati if not watched closely. Answer.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.

LOUISVILLE, KY., September 24, 1862.

Major-General WRIGHT, Cincinnati:

Major General Thomas L. Crittenden has crossed Salt River with the advance of Buell's army, consisting of 12,000 men and six batteries of artillery. Louisville is now safe. We can destroy Bragg with whatever force he may bring against us. God and liberty.

W. NELSON,

Major-General.
