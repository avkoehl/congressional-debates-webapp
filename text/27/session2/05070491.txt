directions for the removal of the statue to the spot where it now
stood, it was under the apprehension that Greenough was to
execute the pedestal, nor was there any ground to fear that his
rights would hastily be interfered with
Mr. T said he could not consent to resume hit seat without
addi&g a word as-to the merits of Mi Pettnch Pettnch was a
Gef man by birth, afldhad long been a student under the immor
tal Tnürwaldsen, the prfhce of modern sculptor Since his
arrival in this country, he had exhibited many proofs of his
plastic talent, which had been very favoiably received by the
American public These exhibitions had been made chiefly
through the countenance and undei the munificent patronage
of the honorable gentleman's (Mr I s) colleague who had
moved the present amendment—a gentleman long distinguished
by his love of the fine aus, and the noble 3'beraliiy with which
he encouraged them* A statue by Pettnch had been exhibited
in this city at the studio of that modest artist, which did very
great credit as well to his td'ent as an artist as to the taste and
judgment of the gentleman who had brought him into public
notice* "Bvery one who had seen it would at once remember
the Statue of the Fisherman s Daueh er It had «mee be^n ex
hitsited in Philadelphia, wl ere it had at'racted similar admira
tion Pettiith was aman of education, in which respect he
had greatly the advantage of his master, Thoiwaldsen, who
was so entirely i literate aps not to be able even to lead or write,
hut who showed an inspiration m relation to hi& art which
placed him at least on a level with Chauntry and Canovd, parti-
cipants #ith himself m the highest f une of modern time" His
student, Pettnch, was an eduoatt d man, very modest and unas
sommff, and who had manifested by his woi frs exhibited in this
country, that he possessed,in a large degree boih genius and
industry, and since genius and talent belonged to no clime and
no country, hut were the common treasure and possession of
mankind at large, Mr I did not perceive but that a foreigner
wjightwuhas much propriety be invited to produce a design
for a great public worfr, as one who happened to be born < n
our own soil But, as to any hostile mtei ference with the rights
or claims of Air Greenough, Mr I was perfectly confident that
no such thing was ever thought of                    
Mr WI*üE wished to inquire of the commiffee who had
charge of this statue whether the oedestal was not, in strictness,
a pan of the statue1*—and whether Mr Greenough was not
bound to complete it as such, for the compensation already al
lowed him
Mr PENDLETOr* said hat the commi tee had nothing todo
with: that question Their sole du y was as to the location of the
statue
Mr WISE said that it was a necessary pait of the sfa'ue, or it
wasnot, and Mr Greenough was b mndto furni hitas such 01
he was not If it was a pal t of the statue, then Mr Gi er noush
was aheady under agreement to lurris-h it, ai "1 be n ight claim
it as his right, but to Mr W it seemed some hit g like Jewing
tile Government to send them an incomplete thing, and then
claim to do tbi> íesidue for a new compensation It the statue
Was a separate work then that was complete 1 and Cingr °s
were at perfect liberty to empl y somebody else to make a
pedestal for it It might be fair enough, however, to allow
Greenough to lflustiate hisown woik Cut Mr W had a fur
thennquiry to put, vtz whether the statue itself had yet been
formally and officially accepted by the Government of the Urn
ted States?
(Mr Pendleton made the same response as before ]
Mr W said he thought that ought to have been a preliminary
inquiry, befoieany thing fuithei was done Was it the wish of
thla Government that an image—a. personification such as
that—should be erected in the rotundo ot the Capitol of the
if mted States, or tinta statue of George Washington should <ie
placed there? Mi W did t ot profe«b to be a man of any taste
at all, let alone a man of exquisite taste am1 judgment m the
fine arts, but,-speaking asan American citizen, he must say that
that was not the conception ofGeoige Washington which had
any place m his mind.
He had been told, by those who had far higher claims, tosoeak
on subjects like this, that to look upon that piece of sculpture
made the blood to thrill in one's veins Al! Mi W could Bay
was, that it never had had any such eff« ct upon him possibly
because he had never loolted long enough upon it at anyone
time He must confess it had on him much the &ame effect as
it had produced on a gentleman of Maryland one of the olden
time, agentleman of the old school, who, haungheaidsomuch
said of this statue, mounted his hoise and lode a longdistance
pmposely to look at it Having hitched his hoise before the
Capitol, he mounted he steps and entued the rotundo, where,
after looking at the statue for a few seconds turned from it as
he said the father nf his co irtiy woul 1 do, who was the most
modest or men What was it but a p'a&iausm fruri the hea
then mytholegy, to lepresetit a Christ an nerof—a Jupiter To

he was allowed halt an outfit,) and whea minister to Prussia,
(m which case hegot no outfit whatever ) Thi<? continued till
the case of Mr Murray, who, from being xmmster at iba
Hague, was sent to negonate a treaty with France' he hadJ>é$J
allowed hut halfanoutii*, but was dissatisfied, and, on h}s re-
turn, claimed a full outfit as of right, which claim was allowed
by Sir Jefferson.
From that day fo this, the pi actice had regulaily been to allow,
m cases of transfer, full outfit Mr Hughes had as strong, if
not a stronger claim to this allewancej than Sir Murray had ijft
