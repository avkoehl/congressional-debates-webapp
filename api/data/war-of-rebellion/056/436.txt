Kinney's Ford from south side of the Holston, to join me on the road to Nance's Ford. The enemy is reported to hold the latter ford. The road is said to be bad, but I will be on it as soon as it is light enough to see.

General ELLIOTT,

Strawberry Plains:

Dispatch received. You speak of going to Nance's Ford. Are you not mistaken about its being a ford? I was informed that it was a ferry, and so referred to it in my last dispatch.

HEADQUARTERS OF MAJOR-GENERAL PARKE,Near Blain's Cross-Roads, December 17, 1863.

General W. L. ELLIOTT,

Chief of Cavalry, Army of the Cumberland,

Strawberry Plains:

GENERAL: Your letter is just received, and General Parke has read it. We both regret very much that you are so greatly embarrassed for want of means to cross the river.

The general, desires, however, that you avail yourself of every resource that may be at hand, such as boats, scows, &amp;c., and leave no effort unmade to accomplish the crossing if possible. In case you cannot cross where you are, he desires you to move farther up, letting the brigade already over keep pace with you. The general is anxious that your instructions be carried out, but if after all it prove impracticable, you will please report your situation again to him.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. D. STURGIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Cavalry.

General-in-Chief:

Sherman has returned. Granger and Elliott in pursuit of Longstreet. I go to-morrow to Nashville. If appearances do not improve, I will go to Knoxville in person about the 27th. I want before starting to organize and start a heavy cavalry force to move against Forrest, who seems to be collecting in West Tennessee to interrupt our communications.
