No. 322. Report of Captain J. W. Latimer, Acting Chief of Artillery.

CAMP NEAR PORT ROYAL, VA., December 25, 1862.

MAJOR: In obedience to orders, I would most respectfully beg leave to submit the following report of the operations of the batteries of Ewell's division in the engagements with the enemy, near Fredericksburg, on the 13th and 14th of the present month:

Early on the morning of the 13th, I was ordered by General Early to take command of the batteries of the division as acting chief of artillery, and I immediately reported to Colonel Crutchfield, chief of artillery Second Corps, for instructions. He ordered me to park the batteries in a sheltered spot behind a range of hills about half a mile behind our line of battle and there await orders. He shortly after returned and directed me to take my own battery, under command of Lieutenant [W. A.] Tanner, and Captain Brown's, under command of Lieutenant [John E.] Plater, to the relief of some batteries occupying a position near the extreme left of the line formed by the Second Corps, and to report to Brigadier-General Pender, whose brigade then occupied this position. Only five guns were required, and by direction of General Pender I relieved five of the guns at that point by the two rifles belonging to my battery, and the three rifles composing Captain Brown's. The position on which these guns were posted was not a very advantageous one, but the best that could be selected. It was a small rising in an open field, with a wood to the right, in which a portion of General A. P. Hill's division was posted, and on the left was a ditch and bank running parallel with the railroad, behind which a portion of General Hood's division was posted. In front, at the distance of about a mile, were four of the enemy's batteries, with lines of skirmishers considerably advanced in
