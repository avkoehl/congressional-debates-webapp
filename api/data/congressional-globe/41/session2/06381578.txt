I will state that $1,000,000 of this snm of
$2,000,000 was on hand when one half of the
fiscal year had expired, whereas by the word-
ing of the law it would seem that a report of
the expenditure of the entire $2,000,000 was
required to be made at the commencement
of this session. Of course it was the inten-
tion of Congress that the expenditnre of the
$2,000,000 shonld extend through the whole
year; and as emergencies requiring its use
were just aa likeljto arise daring the last half
of the fiscal year the Indian Bureau was cor-
rect in retaining one half of the money for this
purpose.
J* o w, sir, I would like to make a remark with
reference to the instrumentality which the Qua-
kers or Friends have had in the care of reser-
vations daring the last year. Several reserva-
tions have been put under their charge as
agents, and it is my belief, from an examina-
tion of reports and such other information as
we can get on tbe subject, that they have been
the most unselfish and the most jadicioas agents
who have ever been in the service of the Gov-
ernment; that thev show more resnlt for the
money placed in their bands; that they have
brought the Indians further along in the path
of civilization than any other agents that could
have been selected.
And, in this connection, I should like to
make another remark, and that is that the
President of the United States since the laat
appropriation has seen proper, in the exercise
of a proper discretion in the appointment to
office, to select military men for a great many
siiperintendencies, in fact for nearly all of them.
Iti many eases I believe that it has worked
well. It certainly has brought to light a mul-
titude of abases which existed before that time.
' I find by looking over the reports of these
gentlemen that they seem not only to be faith-
ful in the protection of the rights of the United
States aa between the Indians and the Govern-
ment, but also to take an interest in the welfare
of the Indians themselves. I find their sugges-
tions to be excellent. They put their fingers
upon appropriations which are entirely useless,
and show where the money could be better
applied, both for the good of the Indians and
the safety of oar citizens. I have availed my-
self in this bill very largely of the information
derived from this source. Some of the selec-
tions of military men have been less fortunate,
and changes could be made for the better, but
that is not an argument against the system.
There will be on hand at the close of the
current year an unexpended balance of $95,000
I of the amount appropriated for paying Indian
j agents and superintendents. We do not pro-
; pose that this sum shall be covered into the
; Treasury, but that it shall remain as a fund, so
that if the present system which i8 still an ex-
periment snail prove a failure, the executive
department of the Government shall have some
means at its disposal for the purpose of paying
civilians whomaybeappointedaslndian agents
or superintendents, which offices, as I have
already stated, are now held maiuly by military
men. And if these military men are still kept
in office this bill, by the action of the House,
will save to the Government $125,200.
I should like to remark further, Mr. Chair-
man, that as a general rale the Indians have
been peaceful during the past year. I think
more so than any time since I860. There have
been local disturbances, but general peace.
Whether this is owing solely to a better admin-
istration of Indian affairs or not, I cannot say,
but certainly the reports made to the Indian
Bureau are most encouraging in their charac-
ter, and the accounts in the newspapers are
not burdened as they have been iu the past with
so many instances of murder and outrage on
the part of roving bands.
Before closing I wish to direct attention to
the fact that the amount appropriated by this
bill as reported from the Committee on Appro-
priations is $8,193,430 57. The estimates of
the Department were $5,048,384 51, making
a difference in this bill between the estimates
and the appropriations of $1,854,908 94. This
difference is partly accounted for by the fact
that instead of appropriating all the money
called for under the provisions of the new
treaties with the Indians, we have appropriated
only about one half that amount, and have
placed the discretion in the Secretary of the
j Interior to expend the money only for objects
i which will be practical and beneficial to the In-
1 dians. The appropriations last year amounted
to $6,226,791 58, while for the next fiscal year,
as I have stated, we propose to appropriate
$3,193,430 57, showing a difference in favor of
the present appropriation bill over that passed
last spring of $3,038,861 01. This statement
is subject to this qualification, that in the pend-
ing bill there are no appropriations for defi-
ciencies, whereas, in the one passed at the last
session, which was a kind of omnibus bill,
the circumstances under which it came before
the House rendered it necessary that appro-
priations should be included in it for tho pur-
pose of supplying deficiencies. But I can say
that if any aenciences shall hereafter be appro-
priated for, they will be very small in com
Sanson with the amount appropriated for
eficiencies last spring. On tne whole I think
