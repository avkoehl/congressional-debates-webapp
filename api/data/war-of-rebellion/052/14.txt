Major -General McCOOK:

The following is a copy of a telegram just received from General Lytle,at Bridgeport. I send it for your information:

BRIDGEPORT, August 12, 1863.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General:

Howell and Mr. Allen,deserters from Forty-fourth Mississippi,report five regiments opposite-the Seventh, Ninth, Tenth, Forty-first,and Forty-fourth Mississippi,also one battalion of sharpshooters and battery.

Brigade is pocketing about 12 miles of river,from Island Creek to Battle Creek.

Rebel force,2,000 I think. Bridge is prepared to burn. Think of Orders, No. 175, Department of the Cumberland,was circulated to Anderson's brigade it would cause a stampede.

Men afraid of being conscripted if they desert. Mississippians anxious to get home,now Vicksburg has fallen.

About 25 or 30 men,rebel picket station,fired on Island Ford last night,probably at deserters. Our men did not reply.

All quiet here to-day.

W. H. LYTLE,

Brigadier-General.
