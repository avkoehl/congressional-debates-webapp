tion is south 40 west from here. Their shots can do us no harm, and indicate, it seems to me, that the enemy is not in force between here and there, as the balls would hurt their own men; if so, General Burnside has opened one or two shots, I suppose in reply. I hear a few cannon shots about south 20 east, apparently General Hancock, along the plank road. I will report as fast as I hear from my front. The orders were given to advance promptly.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

P. S.-There has been skirmishing all along my front nearly all the morning.

General HUMPHREYS:

Brisk musketry has begun in General Hancock's front at 11.15 a.m. The enemy's shell southwest from here occasionally reach my headquarters.

Respectfully,

Major-General.

MAY 7, 1864-4.45 p.m.

General WARREN:

The working party have retired from the pits, and have bivouacked in two lines 200 yards to the rear. The enemy have shifted two guns from left to our right, so as to command more fully the Parker's Store road. No other change.

Very respectfully,

GEO. J. CLARKE.
