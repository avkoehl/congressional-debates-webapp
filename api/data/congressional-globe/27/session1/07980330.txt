SSO                             _________APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.________                August, 1841.
27th Cong......1st Sess.                                       Public Lands—Mr. Benton.                                                               Senate
to Charleston, New Orleans, and others—which
were growing and prospering upon an increased
fortegn trade New Orleans especially was grow-
ing upon this trade—upon free trade and low du-
ties—but home valuations and cash duties will ex-
tinguish this source of her prosperity—will annihi-
late her as an importing city—will make her again
a second hand importer from the city of New
York—giving to that city two sets of profits upon
her trade, one set upon the exports, the oiher upon
her imports All that will then be wanting to com-
plete her misfortune will be a branch of a National
Bank, controlled by New York and London mer
chants, to make money scarce in ihe fall when the
crops are coming into market, and these foreigners
want to purchase produce, and plenty m the spring,
when they want to sell merchandise This is the game
they played with so much profit to themselves and
damage to the country, when they had a Branch
Bank there, and no wonder the s?me gentry want
another for tbe same nefarious purpose
How shall I speak of the Constitution? that in-
strument, once so sacred, now so pitiable under
the absurd constructions and force f interpretations
daily put upon it What shall I say of 1', and of
the argument of the gentleman from Virginia f Mt
Archer,] who finds a power to do what Congress
pleases with this land bill revenue in the clau e
which authorizes it "to dispose of the Tantoiy of ike
United States." If he bad read one word farther, he
would have seen that this «ame power to dispose of
territory, extended to "othir property," so that
there is nothing peculiar in the power that relates t>
land. Congressmaydisposeof all the property of the
Union—lands—money—goods—foris—ship^—this
capítol—every thing. It may dispose of all; bat
all for the purposes known to the Constitution — to
carry into effect constitutional mtasuies—to do
what is authorized to be dore—and lo do nothing
else. This is the waj to undersiai d Ihe power lo
dispose of territory; and in the same way must be
understood Ihe power lo lay taxes, and to boirow
money The taxes laid, and the money borrowed,
must be for co^titutiona! object*—not for the
arbitrary or gratuitous di p(sal of Congres"
Take the clause to borrow money, consider it
without reference lo ihe rest ol ihe Cons'i uiion,
as the gentleman would consider the land ard pro
perty clause, and what becomes of i? An
unlimited grant of power to borrow money
for unknown and unlimited purposes. Look
at it. " To borrow money on Ihe credit cf the United
Slates" That is all. To borrow money, without
Hfeying for what purpose; but the phra e rüates.
back to thepurposes before expws-d—it reíales to
the rest of ihe Constitution, and must be taken in
subjection and subord nation 10 the conditions and
limitations of the instrument. So of the power to
dispose of land and property "TAe Congress shall
have power to dispose of, and mak- all needful rul-s
and TegvlatMñs respecting, the territory or other pyo
perty belonging to the United ¡stales " This !■< the
same phraseology u ed in relauoj to ot'ier po ver*
The objec s and uses are exposed at the begin-
ning, and are implied and understood in every sub-
sequent grant Repetitions were needles'—would
have been lautologous—and I must say once
more, and rorever, that when Congress Las dis-
posed of land or property, it must take up tbo list
of its grained powers, look to the catakgue Oi its
prescribed duties, search out th> objects committed
to lis care, and then in virtue of this power which
it finds, in discharge of this duty «hieh it feeK,
ana in accomplishment of thu object which it
sees, i - 'si apply the proceeds of the land^ or
other              as it would the t roceeds of loans or
taxes                 way, and in this way aloie,can
the Ctipstitutton be r, estrved or executed To
give independent lueah ngs to ddached s8-ntenees,
is to jervert, distort, destroy, ard fals fy ihe in-
strument it cannot be detached, and executed
piecemeal It must be taken at, a «hole, and every
part keptin harmony with ihe lest
The gentleman from V"ginia, [VIr Archer,]
to whose speech I am now replying, in alius on to
the fiequent cry of breach of the Constitution,
when there is no breach, says he is sick and weary
of the cry, wolf wolf when there is no wolf I
say so too.   The Constitution should not be trifled
1 with—should not be invoked on every petty occa-
sion—should not be proclaimed in danger when
there is no danger Granting that this has been
done someumes—that too often, and with too little
consideration, the grave question of cons'itutiona-
li y has been pressed into trivial discussions, and
violation proclaimed where there was none, grant
ing this, I must yet be permitted to say that such is
not the case now. It is not now a cry of wolf'
when thpre is no wolf It is no false or sham cry
now. The bey cries in earnest this time The
wolf has come' Long, lank, gaunt, hungry, vo-
rac ous and ferocious, the beast is here * howling
for its prey, and determined to have it at the ex-
pense of the life of the shepherd The political
stockjobbers and gamblers raven for the public
lands, and tear the Constitution to pieces to get at
them The./ seize, pillage, and plunder the lands.
It is not a case of mi construction, bm of viola'ion.
It is not a case of misunderstanding the Const tu-
tion, but of assault and battery—of maim and
morder—of homicide and assassination—commilte-d
upon it Never has such a daring outrage been
perpetrated—never such a contraven ton of the
object of a confederation—never such a total
perversion, and barefaced departure, from all the
purposes for which a community rf States bound
themselves together for ihe defence, and not for
tie plunder, of each other No,sr' no' The
Constitution was not made to divide money This
Confederacy was not framed for a distribution
among its members of land^, money, property, or
effects of any kind It contains rules and direc
tions for raising mi ney—for levying duties equally,
which the new tariff will violate, and for raising
direct taxss in proportion to Federal popnlatnn,
but it contains no ruie for dividing mone}, and
the distubutors have to make ore as they go, and
the rule they make is pieci«ely the one that is ne
cesjary to carry the bill, and that i artes with the
varying strength of the di tnbuting party In
183.6, in the deposite act, it was the Federal repre-
sentation in the two Houses oí Congress in this
bill, as it came from the House of Representatives,
it was the Federal numbers We have put in re-
prt sentation it will come back to us with nutrbei«,
and numbers will preva 1, for it id a meie case of
plunder—the plunder of the young States by tbe
old ones—of the weak by the strong Sir, it is¡
sixteen yeais since these «chemes of distribution
weie brought mto this chamber, and I have viewed
them a'l in the same li^ht, ?nd gnen th m all
the same indignan oppi'ition I have opposed
all these schemes as unconstitutional, immoral,
fatal lo the Union, degrading to the people, de-
bauching f> the Slates, and inevitably tending lo
ctntr<tli<m on one hand or >o disruption on the
other I have opposed the whole, beginning with
the first proposition cf a Senator from New Jersey
[Mr Dicki-rson] to divide rive millions of Ihe smk-
írgiund, and foil wing the banefnl schern through
all its modifications for ihe distribution of surplus
revenue, and finally of land levenue I have op-
posed the whole, adltfnng to the Constitution, and
to the objects of the Confederacy, and scorning the
epheneral popularity which a venal system of
plunder could purchase from the vie'ims, or the
dupes, of a fal e aad sordid policy
I scorn the bill I scout its vaunted populara)
I t'etest it Nor can I conceive of an object more
Pitiable and contemptible than that of the dema-
gogues haranguing for votes, and exhibiting his
tables of dollars and acres, in < rder to show each
votei, or each Slate, bow much money hey will b*
able to obtain from the Treasury if the la^d bill
passes Such haranguing, and such exhibition, is
the address ot impudence and knavery to supposed
ignorance, meanness, and folly It is treating ihe
people as it they were penny wise, and pound
foolish, and still more mean than foolish Why
ihe l«nd revenue, after deduct ng the expenses, if
fairly divided among the people, would not exceed
nine pence a head per annum, if fairy dividid
among the States and appl ed to their debts it
would not superse'e above nmepence per anntm
of taxation upon the uní s of the population The
diy for land sale* have gone by The sak> of this
3 ear do not exceed a million and a half of dollars,
which would not leave more than a million for dis-
tribution, which, among sixteen millions of people,
would be exietly fourpencs half-penny, Virginia
money, per head' a fip in New York, and a
pictallon in Louisiana At two millions, it would be
nmepence a head m Virginia, equivalent to a
levy in New York, and a ¡>ii in Louisiana' pre-
cisely the amount which, in specie times, a gentleman
gives lo a negro boy for ho'dtng his horse a minute
at the door And for this miserabledoit—this insigni-
ficant subdivision ot a shilling—a York shilling—
can the demagogue supp-se that the people
are base enough to violate their Constitution,
mean enough to surrender the defence of their
country, and stupid enough to be taxed in their
coffee, tea, salt, sugar, coals, hats, blankets, shoes,
shut1-, and every article of comfert, decency, or
necessity, which they ea , drink, or wear, or on
which they stand, sit, «leep, or he'
The compacts with the new States what be-
comes of them m this total violation of all the
principles on  h ch they res,f? The Federal Go-
vernment and the new States have entered into
compact s, based upon the acknowledged fact that the
vacant lands belong to the Federal Government m
its Federal and corpoi ate capacity, andwhi'eso be-
longing to it, no taxes Were to be laid upon the Fede-
ral soil, or any interference attempted in its primary
disposition The lands are now to pass Irom the
Government—to become the property of the mdi-
v dual States—and to be admmis'e ed by them,
with the «ole view of the extortion of money for
their new owners Tne paiental Administration
of the Federal Governrrent is to cea e- remorse-
1-ss avarice is to lake the place of guardian caie.
No more chance for reducnon of price, no practi-
cable or beneficial pre-emptions, no more grants
ot dcnatiens, no cessions, even ot the refuse, en
any terms, no further confirmations of unsettled
claims All parental fee'mg, all liberal policy, all
sense of justice, ceases vsiih the change of relation
between the new Slates ?nd the Federal Govern-
ment, and with the tiansfer of th  new States to
the owner hip of the old ones. This terminates
the compacts on the part of tbe Federal Govern-
ment—terminates tuem by the act of that Go-
vernment —and remits every new Sta e to
the exercise of the sovereign rights which the
existence of the compacts bad su*p°nded—not an-
nihilated. The obhaation of non-taxation, and of
non interference with the primary disposition of
the soil, cease with the violation of die compacts
by the Federal Governments The suspended
nghts—in abeyance heretofore—now become ac-
tive, and it is for the new States to say what they
will do
The Federal Government is tbe agent of the
Chickasaw IndiPiis to sell their la"ds in the State
of Miss ssippi She is lo make the sales, receive
the money, deduct the expenses, and turn over the
nett proceeds to the Indians This she does by
virtue ol a ireaty with that tribe. By th's bill she
sinks to the same condition with respect to all the
public lands She ceases to be owner, and be-
comes the land agent for the old Stales, and upon
the same terms and conditions as in the case of
the Chickasaws. She is to sell the lands, not for
herself, but for the S ates She is to receive the
money, deduct the expenses, and pay over ihe pro-
ceeds to the State treasuries. Thus the Federal
sovereignty has pared with its lands in the new
S ales—become a land agent—and can find noth-
ing in the Constitution or the compacts to protect
this anomalous and derogatory condition In the
State of Mississippi the agency rested upon soms
reasons, for the Indians owned the land before,
aDd took that method to get rid of their title. Be-
sides, they introduced the graduation principle,
making the price de«c nd annuilly through a de-
clining scale, until it ended, in the short space of
five years, at six and a quar er cents per acre. This
ensured the sale of all the lands, at just prices, in a
sh it lime, and was eminently favorafele to the
State and his inhabitants But these old States,
now becme the owners cf the Federal lands, less,
friendly to us than the Chtcka aw Indians to ihe
Mississ'ppians, refuse graduation while promising
it, and mean to exact a dollar and a quarter, «olid
money, (for Western paper will not answer their
purpose) for every acie, no matter how worthless,
