REMARKS OF MR. DUNCAN,
Of Ohio
In the House of Repieeen ctwti, September 11, 1837
On the follow ing resolution offered by Mr Smith,
of Maine
Resolved, That the action of the seveial standing
committees ot lb s Hou^e, on all matteis not em-
braced b} the Me sace of Hit Picsultnt ol the Uni-
ted States to th1- tvio lie uses of Congress, commu-
nicated or the second day of the cuirent session,
be suspended until the comnvmiement of the an-
nual session of Congress in December next, and
that the considciauon ot all pctiho is on si ch sus-
pended matters be also pjsLl,one I to the puiod
above -p^c fitd
Mr DUJNCAN, 'ail h" did ni t use for
the put pose of vv as i lg the time oi the Hoi se, but
he felt himself brand to do h s, pau tuviarls -.U5-
tammg tne present íes (Union, 1( i he considered it

Government To tie pjop't, because ns adoption

close, ? id theicby save a vast expense that the
country was i H ab'e to incur at this time To the
Government, because it won d leceive the imme-
diate benefit of eailv legislation on tho weight) and
important mattere that had renicred it neces ory to
convene Congress at this unusual season Mi D
said he came here entertaining veiy diffeient vie«s
from some gentlemen who had addressed the House
on this and some o'her propositions He enne lor
the purpose ot lelievmg the Government, or the
Treasury thereof, Irora the embanassmenls produ-
ced by the suspension of sp->Cie payments by the
banks, and to afloid such relief to othei interests in
the country as may b° found within the power of
Congress In l!i« language of the Pn suitnt's Mes-
sage, "The act of the 23d June, 1836, legulatmg
the deposites of the public money, and directing
the employment oi Distnct, State and Teni-
tonal banks, foi that purpose, made it the
fluty oí the Secretary of the Tieasuiy to dis-
continue the use of such of them as should at
any time refuse to redeem ih^ir notes in specie,
and to substitute other banks, provided a sufficient
numbei could be obtained to receive the public
deposites upon the same teims and conditions
theiem prescribed. But a state of thmss has oc-
curred which the wisdom of Congress had not an-
ticipated The wholesome provisions of the act
for the security of the public íevenue, and regula-
tion ot the deposites, was at once defeated bv the
act oí Ihe banks all "uspeudmg payment at or
about the same time The collection of the íeve-
nue which, undei such a state oí things, must, of
necessitj, be m nothing but gold or bilvei, became
extremely difficult—so much so that the Executive
had found it necessaiy to give mdulgtnw on duty
bonds Nor was the collection moie difficult than
the sate keeping and transmission to places to be
used v. hen collected
Owing to the diminution of ihe revenue, m
consequence of thi> general suspension and embar-
rassment of the country, it has become a question
whether it is pioper or not to deposite with the
States the fourth instalment of the surplus of last
spung, accordmgto the piovismns of said act, winch,
it deposited, v. ould lequire of the Government t iccn-
tra< t a loan equal to the amount of =aid instalment
These,saidMi D aie apaitof the gieatandw eighty
matters that superinduced the <all ot Concuss al
this unusual time and it set mi 1, in his humille
omnion, that the occasion justified the end, and it
was. it possible, to remedj the« evils, that they
vveie convened But gentlemen seemed to think
otherwise, and talked of eveiy thing but the real
object Some talked as though they had come
there to vote money into the pockets of the dis-
tressed people. A very humane object' laudable
indeed' He went in foi the people But did
gentlemen reflect that they must first vote it out
of their pockets'—a policy by xaktch the States Am e been
enriched by the deposites' Other gentlemen, one
would think, came expiessly to abuse the adminis-
tration and the demociatic partv He asked what
words in the English vocabulary had been moie
used, and weie more common m the mouths of
suck, since they had assemb'ed, than " Executive
pahonuge," "Executive coiiupton oí the peiple
and of the press," "Executive influence over the
maj >nty in this House, "misiufr," "pet bonks,"
"humbug," and "slavish and blind attachment"
and all these pouied forth wi'h ah the vmdieti e
ness and malignity of partv raucoi It seuned

the Presidr-nt su&taintd? To deprecate those mea-
sures at this day was to assail directlv the mtell-
gence of the people, to denounce then honesty, and
was no less than a duect charge that they bad
hun bugged ihemseh es The recharler of the ban'r
was the qucshon m 1832, m which all c, es ions of
a patty ci poht.cal characttr weie merged. Gen.
Jackson had vetoed the bill to reel ut^r that insti-
tution on the 4th ot July next preceding the e'ec-
tion The question was fairly presented to the
American people, and thev were all attention to the
subject. Bank documents and parné spt eches flew
through the countiy thick as leaves m autumn.
The merits and dements, the advantage^ and dis-
advantages, the constitutionality and the unconsti-
tutionality ot the bank, were proclaimed from the
stump, the stand, the pulpit, and in the columns of
the piees. 1 he people heard, lead, reasoned, and
judged ten themselves. To say they were not pre-
pared to acton that impoitdntquestion,is to as. ume
the Ii igh-toned fedei al doctrine that they are inca-
pable of being pupal ed But they were prepared,
and did dpoide thiough the ballot boxes The re-
sult of that decision was the le election of Gereral
Jackson to the Presidencv, and the prostration of
the bank.    This was all the work of the people
Wh it next' During his second term of service,
he commited m the estn tat on of geniiemen tne
sail gioater oin of removing the "deposites" from
the P-mk of the United States \nd in that again,
the people humbugged themselves, bv sustaining the
nieasinc notw mstmdmg the notes of panic weie
rais d, and s t'emnly as the tune of Old Hrndud
mouinfulh sunx tnroughout the hnd That was
not all the foolish jieople still contnue to humbug
themselves. They had recently elected llama
Van Buien to the Chief Magistracy, who stood
openly and avowedly pledged, by piactice, by his
profess ons, and upon pimciple, to sustain the same
policy and gieat leading measures that had distin-
guished the administration ot his illtistnous p e-
clecessor Sir, his election was predicated upon
that very pledge And now, notwithstand ihe land

pering, the great body of the people are tin-
unmoved But m all th s, according to the
