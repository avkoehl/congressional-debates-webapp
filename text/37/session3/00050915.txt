assignment of any day for the consideration of
these hills.
Mr. AeSHLEY. Will any other day suit gen-
tlemen upon the other side?

before we make provision for any new States.

business.
The SPEAKER. Reports are still in order

ence to the formation of new States were recom-
mitted to the Committee on Territories.

PENSION ACT.

titled 44 An act to grant pensions, "approved July

recommitted to the Committee on Invalid Pen-
sions, and ordered to be printed.
POST ItOAD BILL.
Mr. MALLORY, from the Committee on Roads
and Canals, reported a bill, supplemental to the
act approved July 14, 1862, entitled " An actto
establish certain post roads, and for other pur-
poses.5'
The bill was read.
Mr. MALLORY. I desire to have this bill put
upon its passage; but before that is done, f wish
to state that an act, to which this is proposed to be
supplementary, was passed at the last session, giv-
ing authority to certain railroad companies whose
roads terminate on the Ohio riverabove the mouth
of the Big Sandy, to construct bridges across the
Ohio. That act is particular in its provisions, and
guards the rights of those who navigate the Ohio,
as carefully as it can possibly be done; but the
omission of that bill was that the privileges which
were extended to those companies whose roads
terminate on the Ohio above the mouth of the Big
Sandy were not extended to those whose roads
terminate below the Big Sandy. By this supple-
mental bill I propose to enable certain companies
below to enjoy the same privileges as are extended
by the original act to those above the mouth of the
Big Sandy. I suppose there can be no objection
to tins bill from any side of the House. I presume
this' thing of partial legislation for the benefit of
one section of the country to the exclusion of an-
other from the enjoyment of the same privileges
will not be persevered in by this House.
Mr. McIiNIGHT. 1 would ask the gentleman
whether he proposes to press this bill to a vote
now, or simply to fix a future day for its consid-
eration ?
Mr. MALLORY. I intend to press the bill to
a vote now.
Mr. McKNIGHT. Then I hope the gentle-
man wiil allow me to be heard.
Mr. MALLORY. This matter is perfectly well
understood by the House. It was discussed dur-
ing the last session of Congress, when the original
bii! was under consideration.
Mr. STEVENS. Has the morning hour ex-
pired ?
The SPEAKER. It has.
Mr. STEVENS. Then I move that the House
proceed to business upon the Speaker's table.
Mr. MALLORY. it request the House to al-
low the bill to be printed.
No objection being made, the bill was ordered
to be punted.
Mr. MALLORY. I understand that the order
to print the bill does not alter its condition at ali ?
The SPEAKER, it does not, and the gentle-
man will be entitled to the floor when the bill
com^s up again.
BUSINESS ON THE SPEAKER'S TABLE.
The motion of Mr. STEVENS was agreed to,
and the House accordingly proceeded to the con-
sideration of the business upon the Speaker's ta-
ble, when the following communication and bills
were taken up, and disposed of as indicated below:
