YORK, via COLUMBIA, [June] 28, 1863.

Major-General COUCH:

This city was formally surrendered to General [J. B.] Gordon's command of rebel forces last evening-9 miles toward Gettysburg. They are 4, 000 to 6, 000 strong, and sent a force last evening to destroy bridge at Glen Rock. All the forces left last evening for Columbia, taking most of the Government stores. The rebels will occupy the town to-day; they will not destroy private property.

HENRY PALMER,

Surgeon U. S. Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SUSQUEHANNA,Colonel COPPEE:

The general directs me to day that, by deferring an important reconnaissance until to-night, he can send the cavalrymen; not otherwise.

M. A. RENO,

Captain, and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SUSQUEHANNA,June 28, 1863.

General SMITH, Bridgeport:

You need not defer the reconnaissance; I have made other arrangements for cavalry.

JNO. S. SCHULTZE,

Major, and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATE FORCES, Bloody Run, via John's Branch, June 28, 1863.

Major General D. N. COUCH, Harrisburg:

Your dispatches received. When ordered to make command here, I was at or near McConnellsburg. On arriving here, I found about 2, 000 men, from every company composing the command of the old Second Division of the Eighth Army Corps; about one-third of the men without arms, all somewhat demoralized, and desiring to get to their regiments. I am laboring here under very great difficulties, but will do the best I can. As a position, I do not consider this one of very great safety, or one of much strategic importance. Imboden's forces, I understand, are at ore near Hancock, organizing a force to march against us. I deem it best that this command should be moved down nearer Bedford, and hold some of the mountain passes, but will await your orders. We have two pieces of artillery here, not effective; cannot be used out of point-blank range. They are smooth-bore guns, without scale or harness.

L. B. PIERCE,Colonel, Commanding.
