CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
make against the Hou«e for having confirmed the
report The majority of the House had been c> arged with hav
ing acted with indecent hurry, with madness and blindness,
and he would appeal to the sober second thoughts of the mi-
nority of the committee who made this charei, whether the
facts of the case wouldjustify them in the use of such uncour
teous 1 mguage Did not the records show that the House was
in oossession of all the evidence material to the cise decided
on? Was not that decision made after a long and protracted de
bate, when every gentleman Who desired it had been heard on
the subject? And again, it had unjustly and falsely been al
leged that the maionty of the House had brought in these five
New Jersey members to enable them to carry out some favorite
measure of the Admmistration Did the gentleman allude to
the Sub-Treasury bill, to the resolution against the as
sumption of the State debt , or to any other of these
great measures on which n was well known that
there was a large majority of the House committed before
these members came in? But see the in onsistency of
thw part of the gentleman's argument The House, bv a large
majority, at least thirty, voted in these five members, thev had
a majority sufficiently large to commit what the gentleman
«insiders such a gross outrage, and with such indecent hurry,
aVdvet with this large majority, they wanted these five addi
tibnal members to enable them to carry out their favorite mea
sures The inconsistency and absurdity of this argument car
nod with it its own refutation
Mr B next answered the complaint made, that the Housa
would not give the minority the liberty of submitting their re
port, and showed lha , on the day it was offered, the gentleman
from Virginia [Mr BottsI moved to suspend the rules to re
ceive it, when the House was engaged on the majority report,
and the motion failed because it was known and it was so de
cided by the Speaker, that, if it prevailed, it would supersede
the action of the House on the mijonty report But, at the
first moment after the majority report was det lded on, the gen
tleman from Virginia again offered his report, when it was re
ceived by general consent, and the question of rec ptn n was
supposed to be decided, when the gentleman from Louisiana
[Mr Garland] objected to us being received m this way, and
demanded the yeas and nays The report of the minority,
therefore, was kept back by the minority, as the records would
show, and it would here be recollected that the gentleman from
Massachusetts [Mr Calhoun] objected to the reception, and
said that he wished it to go forth as a suppressed report
It appeared, then, that the minority wanted their leport to be
Teceived ata time that it would set aside the report of ihe majo
rit?; ami.because they sou Id not get that,they raised the cry that
it was stipp e sed The g>ntleman, he said, had appealed from
the decision of this Hou>e to the people It was belore that tri
banal that he and his friends desired to meet them We, said
he have been the advocates of the right of the people to choose
their owi Representatives—the gentlemen in the minority have
been the advocates of the right of the Governor of New Jersey
and his broad seal to set aside the will of the people Letal] the
fa ts fairly and truly go before the people, and he did not fear
t ie result.
After answering the arguments of the gentlemen in the Op
position m full Mr B concl ided, when
Mr WATTERSOV moved the previous question, but the
House refused to second it—ayes 58, noes 77
Mr BOTTS then obtained the floor, and desired to know if
any gentleman of the majority of the committee wished to ad
dress the House on the subjeu If so, he would give way, as he
preferred following in reply The gentleman from Virginia,
[Mr Rrvsa] introduced the subject, and here were three other
members of the majority of the committee yet to speak on it
As he then was the only member of the minority that intended
to address the House on this snbfct, he thought it but fan that
he should have the benefit of making the last speech
Mr RIVES of Virginia begged leave to correct the gentle-
man Hs did not introduce the subject, and had only spoken in
explanation to correct the gentleman from Maryland [Mr Jb
nifbkJ
Mr GARLAND of Louisiana said that he had submitted the
amendment on which the debate was proceeding, and he thought
that if any one had the right to make the concluding speech he
had.
Mr CAMPBELL observed that the majority of the commit-
tee were willing to rest the case, on their part, upon the argu-
ment of the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr Bbown ] But if
the gentleman from Virginia, or any other gentleman, addressed
the House, with any arguments necessary to be answered, the
members of the committee of course reserved to themselves
the right of replying
Mr riSHER observed that he was one of those who desired
to address the House on thissubject, and that he had endeavored
to obtain the floor at the time that his friend from Tennessee
did But, said he, if we look at the nature of the debate, it
will be perceived that it is not necessary for any member of the
•ommutee to continue it What was the debate It was
an attack upon the committee, impugning their motives and
conduct They had been arraigned here and out of the Hi use
ATI that we have to do is to reply to the charges that have been
made against us This had been done, and successfully done
We have, said he, successfully defended ourselves, and tnum-
fhantly refuted the charges that have been made against us
am, therefore, willing toaest the case with the able and un
answerable speech of the gentleman from Tennessee, [Mr
Brown ] We do wish to make any charges, and do not feel
under the necessity of making any other speeches unless
new matter is indroduced, and new charge* made In that case
we reserve the right te reply to them
Mr BOTTS then proceeded m another attack on the maionty
of the committee, going over the same ground which had been
previously occupied by those who had preceded him on the
same side of the question He had not conclu 'ed when the
the morning hour expired, at which time,
Mr J W JONES said n must be obvious to the House that
speedy action was necessary on the Treasury note bill He,
therefore, moved that the rules be suspended to enable him to
submit a motion to go into committee on that bill, and on that
moti hi he demanded the yea3 and nays, which were or
dered
Mr. RUSSELL hoped, inasmuch as this day wa* set apart
for the consideration of private bills, that the rules would not
be suspended
The question was then taken, and the rules were not suspend-
ed—yeas 103, nsvs 72

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Saturda v, March 2l, 1810
Mr WELLER asked leave to introduce a resolution, which
w sretd for the information of the House, as follows
Resolved, That a select committee of three he appointed to
ascertain and report whether any officei of this House has, dur
ins the present session, furnished stationery to any person not
entitled, by law, to the same; also to report the probable value
thereof
Mr CIIINN moved so to amend the resolutioa so as extend
the inquiry to members of the House
Mr DAWSON was here understood to object, and made some
remarks whirh were not distinctly heard
Mr WELLER replied that his resolution did not propose an
examination of the fact whether members of Congress used
more stationery than was necessary for the transaction of then
business, for of this the members themselves must be the
judges, but he hid understood that some of the officers of this
House had been in the habit of furnishing statiorery to letter
writers, reporters, and others not embraced within the law
Now he simply proposed an examination into the truth of this
allegation The gcnt'eman from Georgia [Mr Dawson]
might thank this a "trifling" mat'er, but he was one of those
who believed that all abuses of this sort should be corrected
He was unwilling that the people of thw country should b-
taxed to purchase stationerv for letter writers and others who
saw proper to lounge about the Capitol during the session of
Congress He cared not who the resolution might operate up
on, the practice to which he adverted was a violation of the
law, and should not be tolerated
Mr DAWSON had so much confidence in the Clerk,who had
charge of the stationery, that he believed he would not let it be
improperly used, and he therefore objected to the introduction
of the resolution.
Mr CRAIG said, notwithstanding it was considered a small
matter by some, be moved a suspension of the rules, and, on
that motion, demanded the veas and nays, which were not or
d red
The question was then taken on suspending the rules, and
decided in the negative

viously given, introduced a bill for the relief of Alford
George; and abill for the benefit of William. Thompson, which
were read twice and referred to the Committee of Claims

time, ask leave to introduce a bill to provide for the improve
mentofthe Alleghany river

riveis and harbors

mony connec ed with the New Jersey contested election, and
the amendment ol Mr R Garland of Louisiana to discharge
the Committee of Elections fiom the further consideratu n of
the papers in relation to the New Jersey question
Mr BOTTS, who was entitled to the floor on the above
question, not being in his seat,

were engaged in the prosecution of private claims before Con
gress, by petmission of the House, introduced a resolution em
powering the committee to send for persons and papers, whah
resolution was agreed to
Mr S WILLIAMS moved that the House agree to receive
reports from committees during the morning hour
Mr THOMPSON of Mississippi objected, whereupon,
Mr S WILLIAMS moved a suspension of the rules format
'i purpose, which motion was not agreed to
1 Mr SMITH of Maine said a number of the States had not
I been afforded an opportunity except on one occasion, to present
i petitions to the House He really hoped that this occasion
11 would be embraced by the House to enable gentleman who had
not been afforded an opportunity,to present their petitions during
the remainder of the morning hour
Objection havtBg been made,
Mr SMITH moved to suspend the rules for the purpose
Mr ADAMS inquired what was the object of the gentleman s
motion                                                                  ,          .
Mr SMITH replied, to call the States for petitions during the
morning h«ur
Mr ADAMS If that was the gentleman's object, he was sin>
cerely happy to find that the gentleman was an advocate for
reception of petition?
Mr SMITH said, having so powerful a co operator as the
gentleman from Massachusetts, I am «ure there can be i o ob
jecuon to the motion
The question was then taken on the motion to suspend the
rules, and it was disagreed to
Mr THOMPSON of Mississippi did not see why the House
should pass over this business The gentleman from Virginia
[Mr BottsIH was true, had the floor, and it «eemeil to him u at
if he wished to claim it he ought to be here Mr T did not
know what had been ihe practice of the House on similar occa
sions, but he was under the impression that the House had not
heretofore passed over the business in order because of ti e ab
sence of a member entit ed to the floor It was the duiy of the
gentleman to be here, and as he was not, the House ought to go
on without him
Mr WILLIAMS of North Carolina moved a call of the
Hou c,but
Mr BO ITS then appearing in his seat,
Mr W1LI I\MS withdrew his molion
Mr BOTTs then resumed his remarks m continuation of
those of yesterday Asihe majority of ihe committee, he said,
had announced that they had nothing fur her to say on the sub
ject, unless some new ch irees should be made against them,
and, as he had no new charges to make, but should confine him-
self to the old ones, he thought it but right lhat he should have
the advantage of closing this debate As the committee, how
ever, would not allow him this privilege, he should jiow pro
ceed with his remar! s Mr B then continued his argument,
examining and commenting on the jouri al of the committee,
for the purpose of sustaining the charge that had reen made by
Mr Fillmore and Mr Jenifer, and refuttd by Mr Brown
of Tennet-sce
Mr JONES of Virginia said he could not permit any op por
tunny to pass by without urging the House to take up the Trea-
sury Notebill He asked for a suspension of the mies, toena-
ble him to make a motion tint the Hou^e resolve itself into a
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union to consider
