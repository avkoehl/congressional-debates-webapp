INDIANAPOLIS, IND., August 21, 1862.

Honorable E. S. STANTON:

Governor Morton has satisfied me that the time for making his draft should be extend until the 15th of September. Nothing will be lost if the additional time is given for preparing the meant for the field, whilst the draft can be much more fairly distributed over the State. Cannot authority be given to the Governor to extend the time, as he requests?

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

INDIANAPOLIS, IND., August 21, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Complaints are made of the arms furnished the State for the volunteers, and from personal inspection I think deservedly. They are of Austrian manufacture. The hammers are inferior and frequently broken, and the screw of the Enfield nipple, which is used, being different from that in the barred, a few discharges render them useless. Out of the 3,000 but 500 could be issued, and they indifferent. The springs of fully one-half are too weak to explode the caps, and the others only explode cap after two or three trials. The Governor says the State has secured far below her proportion of Springfield arms, whilst her numbers in the field are very large. Several of the regiments recently sent have miserable arms. Accouterments are needed. All received have been issued, and none whatever are on hand to furnish troops rapidly assembling. He further states that the Ordnance Department has not yet furnished the two field batteries for which requisitions were made on the 14th of July. Artillery companies are consequently sent into the field without equipments.
