and deserving credit and confidence precisely in
proportion as they should confine their operations
withm their fixed means, and abould discharge
faithfully and promptly ail the oVigations im-
posed by their charters In this light only was
he disposed to discuss the claims of the local
banks upon the conntty, or the confidence of the
people The profits oí the corporators  was not a
consideraron to enter into a discussion like the
present It was a mere consequence of the faith-
ful discharge of one of the highest trusts which
any Government could delegate, the trust of
making a currency for the peooie of the country,
and if he had succeeded in showing thai this trmt
could he more safely and perfectly executed with-
out, than with, a fiscal connection with this Go-
vernment, he had accomplished his object, and
proved that the just credit of these institutions was
not to be injuriously affected by tne bill.
Who would contend that it* provisions were cal-
culated to injure any other description oí credit*
Would not wealth and integrity receive the same
confidence with the community, whether the funds
of this Government were kept m the State banks,
or m the hands of the officers oí the people?
Would not industry and enterprise gain the same
esteem, and command the same credit, wherever
the Government should choose to place its strong
box? Wou*d neighbor cease to trust and confide
m neighbor because bank notes were not to be re-
ceived m payment 01 the publ c dues'* Certainly
not. The picture was an imaginary one, and
this consequence of the passage of the bill, upon
the credit between man and nan, was not to be ap-
prehended It was the objection of an excited mind,
and rot of sober reason
An argument of a character \eiy si rular to that
last noticed, had proceeds I from the i me source
It was that the passage oí this bill, tho separation
of the funds of the Government irora tne banks, and
the gradual suspension of the receipt of their paper
m payment of th& public dues, would lead to an
universal and exclusive metallic currency for the
whole country in all its business operations. That
it would lead to a currency equal in value to gold
and silver, and convertible into gold and silver at
pleasure, he hoped and beheved But that it would
destroy the State banks, and send us back to an ex-
clusive metallic currency, there was not the
slightest reison for believing If he had not
Hho cd m vain, m a. former pqrt of hm argu-
ment, he had shown ihit tie effect of this
policy would be favorade to the banks, favo-
rabJe to the certainty of their means, to a safe
measuie for their operations, and to the stability of
then credit and confidence with the people If
thess positions should piove to be true, there was
nojusi fcr that the hanks would be destroyed, or
that banVs chartered by the States would not con-
tinue to exist And surely, while banks of issue
were m operation in the country, no one need fear
the prevalence of an exclusive metalhccurrency, for
nothing was moie certain than that bank paper and
gold and silver of equal denominations could not
circulate together. The paper might be made, for
the general purposes of business, of equal value
with gold and silver, but while the cue  was the
EroTiise of a bank to pay, and the other the means
y which alone that promise could be redeemed,
and while it was the direct interest oí the bank that
the promise should take the place of the real vaiue,
and circulate m its stead, ¡he o^e wou'd be with-
draw i from crculatioD and horded, and the other
would be scattered upon ihe wings oí the wind
His iear was, that the whole operations oí tne
public Treasury would be inadequate to fcrrmh a
sufficient specie basis íor o ir paper circulation.
What were those operations in the aggregate, com-
pared to the monetary operations oí the country'
The Senator from Massachusetts (Mr Webster)
had Said they were estimated at from one and a
lialf to two per cent Call them two per cent,
call them five per cent , and will tnty d stnbute a
quantity of the metals sufficient to sustam the im-
mense superstructure o£ pap- * amounting to the
remaining ninety-five or mnetj-eght per cent 1
And from what other source were \\ e to look foi
an extension of our specie basis, if not fio n tí e
operations of this  Government?    Here then was
the fear, and not that too extensive a metallic cur-
rency would be diffused among the people.
He wrould notice a single other objection to this
system, and close his remarks upon this branch of
the subject It had been said that its effect would
be tohoaidvast amounts oí cash capital from the
uses of business How far was this effect to be
anticipated? When the revenues of the country
were made to bear a just relation to its expendi-
tures—a relation which he hoped our recent expe-
rience would induce us most rigidly to preserve for
the future—there would tee nothing to hoard, in the
practical sense of that term We shoald receive
with one hand, and disburse with the other The
payments into the pubhc Tieasury, and the pay-
ments out of it, would be made m the same de-
scription oí cutrency, and what was taken fiom
the uses of business by tne receipts, would be given
back to those uses in the disbursements, without
mateual delay It was true that the great extent
of our territory, the great number of points at
which both receipts and disbursements were to be
made, and the wide distance of their locations from
each other, and from the Treasury here, keeps a
large sum m suspense, and in transitu, during the
whole time. That sum m'ght be liberally esti-
mated at from three to five millions, and it was the
whole amount whtch the ordinary operations of the
Treasury would, m any sense, hoard—the whole
amount which it would withdraw from the uses of
bus ness, when the revenues and expenditure of the Govern
nent should be justly measured together This same sum was
now exac ly simi'ariy employed, aad was suspended m the de
pnsite banks to awai* the presentation of outstanding diaf s that
is it would be 30 suspended if the banks were in a condition to
fulfil their obligations and leet the drafts of the Tieasuiy in
specie or its equivalent
But it might be said that, when our revenues shou d ag tin
become abundant, and exceed our exp nditurcs, so that another
suiplus should accumulate, this system, of deportes would ne
c ssarily leal to hoarding lhis eloquence he most cheer
fully admitted, an 1 lie consileicd it one ot tin- stvongest men 3
of the system He hoped never again to see the time when a
surplus revenue should afflict U3 , but if that time did ever
agim come, u must proceed from an excess of impoitauons,
and a renewal of the speculations 111 our vast public domain
In that case he wished t) see the excess of the revenue hoarded,
closely locked up from the uses of the trading community as
the must efficient, speedy, and certain check to the over trading
and speculations
What, he would ask, would have been the surplus of revenue
during the late excesses, had the accumulations of money in the
public Treasury, paid foi duties and lands, been hoarded then,
and not suirendered to the uses ol the customers of the banks'*
That surplus, under the sv«tem or dep ~>sites then in use, reached
an amount btvon 1 forty mull ms ot dollars Does any one sup
pose it would have reached one third of that sum, if the gold
and silver had been demanded in pigment of the public dues,
and clo&ely locked up m the public depositaries! ISo, sir a
pressure upon the money matk< t would have been produced,
and the excesses arrested before you woul 1 have hoarded ten
millions of com by this process What an infinite benefit to
the country would have be°n produced by suth an action We
should have been saved from the al ost mcura1 le evi s of a sur
plus revenue, ani of its practical distnbution among the Srales
of tne Union, and, what would have been of far mote impor
tance, we should have been saved fiom this tremendoi s revul
sio 1 which the exct s«es of credit have brought upon us
What,su,has been ourown agency in this nati mal calamity"?
Our revenue wasaccjmulatmg millions upon millions beyond
owr wants Wt placed it m the banks forsafek eping, exacted
from them interest fonts use, and thus compelled them to make
loans upon it in the ordinary course of their business It was
a time of ] lenty,and their own means were full, but yet they
must use ours to indemnify them for the iKe which'the law
compelled them to pay Could any system have been better
devised to promote the excesses of which we now complain
Every dollar co lected towards the puolic revenuead led, not
one dollar simply,but hems used as capital twoot three dol
Urs, to the loans" which the cupidity of the banks stimulated
them to nirike Hence the evil, so far as the fundí, of the Go
vemment were concerned promoted its own mciease an 1 «o it
mu^t ever be whib the banks are made the depositories of the
tmblrc moneys hho lid we not then dismiss the idea that a
hoarding of capital is to be a di eadod evil of the pi oponed =y«
tern «so regu'ate out legislation that the revean san ' expe id
ture", in times of stability and regularity of business, will meet
eich other, and des re to hoard when excesses in traie or
credit or «peculation threaten to disturb the healthful «quill
bnum of OV- currency and to plunge usn to reverses such as
we aie now exoei eicm^ For himself he hid nohesitrtion

the coun rv wi^wi h:n the power of Congress he thought this

ration fiom tne banks «eemod to him to be more valuable than
aimos  a«y feature in it
In addition to the remarks hehnl mnñe and the objections

plete without it
The Senator from Belawaie (Mr Paya di had expended
much of his argument in showing that the public furos would
be insecure in suca keeping, and, to fortify him elfin his posi
tion, he had evtubned to us the long list of defaulting public
officers which is annually lud befou us and which comprises
eyerv defaultei fiom the commencement of the Go\ eminent to
the present day This wis apart of the histoiy of our counuy
moat unpleasant and painful, and he cfuld not dwell upon it
w th any pleasure, but ihe Senator, m bringing it to his aid
upon this occasion, seemed to havri foi gotten th u all these de
falcatums had happened undei an eb ablisfied syw.m of bank
depositee, State or nati >nal, and, theiefoie did not ao a step to

security of a systuu of depo-ite m ban *k than t f a keeping by

however, was clear, a>id would be conceded by all which w-ds,
that the depositories proposed to be established by this bill
would not all fail at once and thus effectually block he wheels

He would not detain the Senate to add an} thin** further to
this branch of the argument The President, m hie Message,
had placed the ordinary aspect of the suojcl too clearly before
Congress, and the country, to admit of confirmation by any
tl ing he coutdadd to these forcible an 1 piactifah'e views
This closed the examination he propo ed t > make of the plan
of the fimmist ation, for the exercise of the incidental poweis
of Congress over th" general currency ol the cous ry, and ol the
promuent, objecti ins to that plan, and h" wot d now pi«a to
the alternatives ptoposed by tho'-e who differed from the
President

Scnn'or from Virginia, (Mr Rive«) which in substance is a
ietmnt.0 the s^temot Sate ba ik deposite* connected with
the general recent ibihty, upnncenai 1 conli'irns, ofthenees
0 the Stitt biuks inpayment of the p biic due^ What he
had already said m íeferenceto the administiation plan would
excuse him irom any further discussion of this priposmoB,
than what related to its limitations The pio osition was m
ubstance, similai to one formerly introduced into this body
by the^ame distinguished Senator, and upon that octas on it
und rwent a full discussion It was not, therefoie, apiornsi
tion new to the body, but as he had not taken part in it¡  dis
cussion then, and as it was now brought m conflict with a
system he approved, he felt it to be his duty to test its efir
ciency to accompVh its proposed objects
Those objects seemed to be two, the fust of which was to
strengthen and sustain the State banks, and facilitate their le
turn to snecie pay ments, and the second, to extend and strength
en the specie basis for the paper circulation of the banks, by
expelling from chculation email bank notes
Ihe first objecf was pioposed to be accomplished by a con-
tinuance of thepjhhc deposites with these banks, and by mak
nig their notes when redeemed witfi specie, rece vable m pay-
ment of the public due* He had already discussed both the^e
points, as fully as he pioposfd to do it, under the head of the
influence upon the banks of the passage of the bill before tho
Senate He had there given his reasons for the opin ons that
even a connection, as depositories, between the Estate ha ik° and
the National Treasury, was injurious to the banks th  t if the
connection as depositories did not exist, thereceptabiiity of the
notesof the baniis in payment of the pubhc dues was a matter
of little piactical interest to them, because the netes so recen ed
mustbe immediately prssen'ed lor payment, and could not be
permanently retained in safe keeping, and th it if the separation
between the banks and the Treasury was to be made perpetual,
the present was the most favorable time, so far as the banks
aie concerned, to make that declaration
It therefore remained for him eimilv and concise y to ex
amine the efficacv of the Set ator's plan to exclude «mall rioter,
and extend the c.rculation. of specie
These twufifvt objects weie ptopose 1 to beac mp a^ed
