HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, May 6, 1863.

Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON,Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: I have the honor to state that two dispatches have just been received, one from Lake, a Texas scout, and one from J. W. Gregory, scout, Fifth Virginia Cavalry, stating that General Stoneman's division of cavalry, 5,000 strong, with eight or eleven pieces of artillery, was moving in the direction of Cartesville, on James River, apparently with the intention of crossing and proceeding to the South Side Railroad. Unless some of the cavalry in North Carolina and the south is sent here, it will be impossible to arrest these raids, and they will roam through this entire section of country with little or no molestation.

I am, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

R. E. LEE,

General.

HANOVER JUNCTION, May 6, 1863.

HANOVER JUNCTION, May 6, 1863.

I have crossed South Anna and near Hanover Junction. Stoneman's headquarters yesterday morning were at Thompson's Cross-Roads, 15 miles west of Ashland. Force supposed to be large - cavalry and artillery.

Tuesday morning several camps west of Ashland, 1,500 men, three pieces of artillery, moved back to join Stoneman. I shall get to Thompson's Cross-Roads to-night, if you permit. Answer by telegraph.
