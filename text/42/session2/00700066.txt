THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 11,
man should be allowed to vote, or if he was
not, that his influence should not be felt in the
apportionment of representation in this House.
You must either let him vote, or you shall not
be represented by reason of his numbers. That
is the proposition which was incorporated in
the second section of the fourteenth amend-
ment. It means that, and that, I respectfully
suggest, is all that it does mean; because I
cannot conceive that in the nature of things
there should be another state of facts which
would be applicable. And when the fifteenth
amendment affords a relief to this portion of
the population, this second section of the four-
teenth amendment strikes me as having become
functus officio, or rather as having no vitality.
Mr. MERCUR rose.
Mr. BURDETT. Will the gentleman from
Pennsylvania give way for a motion that the
committee rise?
Mr. MERCUR. I yield to the gentleman
for the purpose of making such a motion.
Mr. BURDETT. There is so much confu-
sion prevailing that I think it is time that the
committe should rise, and I make that motion.
The motion that the committee rise was
agreed to.
The committee accordingly rose; and the
Speaker having resumed the chair, Mr. Bof-
FlNTOif reported that, according to order, the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union had had the Union generally under con-
sideration, and particularly the special order,
being House bill No. 243, for the apportion-
ment of Representatives to Congress among the
several States according to the ninth census,
and had come to no resolution thereon.
PROPERTY OF THE UNITED STATES.
The SPEAKER, by unanimous consent,
laid before the House a letter from the Com-
missioner of Agriculture, in compliance with
the act of July 15, 1870, in relation to inven-
tories and accounts of the property of the
United States in the public buildings and
grounds, &c.; which was referred to the
Committee on Agriculture, and ordered to be
printed.
NINTH CENSUS.
'The SPEAKER also, by unanimous con-
sent. laid before the House a letter from the
Secretary of the Interior, in answer to a reso-
lution of the House of December 7, 1871,
m relation to the number of the inhabitants,
excluding Indians not taxed, in each of the
States and Territories of the United States,
as ascertained by the last census, &c. ; which
was referred to the Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union in connection with
the apportionment bill, and ordered to be
printed.
Mr. COX. I desire to ask the Chair
whether we could not have that information
printed in the Globe to-morrow morning?
There was no objection, and it was so
ordered.
The communication and accompanying table
are as follows:
Department op the Interior,
Washington, December 11,1871.
SiR: In compliance with a resolution of the hon-
2K le House of 1-epresentatives, under date of the
iA"s3aBt,\i,havo !e honor to transmit a table
exhibiting the number of inhabitants, excluding
Indians not taxed, m each of the States and Terri-
tories of the United States, as ascertained by the
last census.
Also, the number of male inhabitants in each
•Jrif^ve4nty"°,neyears affe> andcitizens of
the United btates, "whose right to vote in such State
at any election for the choice of electors for Presi-
dent and Vice President of the United States, Rep-
^ executive and judicial
officers of a State, or the members of the Legisla-
ture thereof, is denied, or in any wav abridged
crime " partlclpatl0n in rebellion, or other
r, A^ave a u° d®omed it;. proper to add a statement
of the number of male citizens of the United States
twenty-one years of age and over, as the same have
been returned by the assistant marshals of the sev-
eral States. °
?eo«ssary to state, intransmitting these tables,
that the l)epartment is disposed to give but little
credit to the returns made by assistant marshals in
regard to the denial or abridgment of suffrage. Tha
unfavorable judgment of the Department in respect
to this single clas3 of statistics is formed,first, from
the application of certain statistical tests, and sec-
ond. from a consideration of the agencies employed,
which are not deemed adequate to the determina-
tion of the numerous questions of difficulty and
nicety which are involved.
I have further the honor to state, that it is not in
the power of the Department to give " the number
of male inhabitants of each State twenty-one years
of age and over," as required by the resolution of i
the honorable House of Representatives. It is not
expected that these statistics will be prepared for
some months to come. It needs, perhaps, to be stated
that the corresponding statements for the eighth
census were not issued from the proas until October
186-4.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your
obedient servant,
C. DELANO, Secretary,
Hon. JXmes O. Blaine.
Speaker of the ITouae of Itefircscntaticcii.
