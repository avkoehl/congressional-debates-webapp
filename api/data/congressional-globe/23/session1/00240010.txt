egates, which were entered upon the Journals of
Congress, The following extracts are from that
document, viz:
" Is it possible that those States who are ambi-
' tiousiy grasping at territories, to which, in our
'judgment, they have not the least shadow of ex-
' elusive right, will use with greater moderation
' the increase of wealth and power derived from
' those territories, when acquired, than what they
' have displayed m their endeavors to acquire
• them>"&c.,&c.
" We are convinced policy and justice require
' that a country unsettled at the commencement of
' this war, claimed by the British Crown, and
' ceded to it by the treaty of Pans, if wrested from
' the common enemy by the blood and treasure of
' the Thirteen States, should be considered as a
' common property, subject to be parcelled out by
' Congress into free, convenient, and independent
' governments, in such manner and at such times
' as the wisdom of that assembly shall hereafter
' direct," &c , &c
Virginia proceeded to open a land office for the
sale of her western lands, which produced such
excitement as to induce Congress, in October,
1779, to interpose and earnestly recommend to
" the said State, and all States similarly circum-
stanced, to forbear settling or issuing warrants for
such unappropriated lands, or.granting the same
during the continuance of the present war."
In March, 1780, the Legislature of New York
passed an act tendering a cession to the United
States of the claims of that State to the western
territory, preceded by a preamble to the following
effect, viz:
" Whereas nothing under Divine Providence
can more effectually contribute to the tranquillity
and safety of the United States of America than a
Federal alliance on such liberal principles as will
give satisfaction to its respective members; and
whereas the Articles of Confederation and perpetual
Union recommended by the honorable Congress of
the United States of America, have not proved ac-
ceptable to all the States, it having been conseived
that a portion of the waste and uncultivated terri-
tory within the limits or claims of certain States
ought to be appropriated as a common fund for
the expenses of the war, and the people of the
State of New York being on all occasions disposed
to manifest their regard for their sister States and
their earnest desire to promote the general interest
and security, and more especially to accelerate the
Federal alliance, by removing, as far as it depends
upon them, the before-mentioned impediment to
its final accomplishment," &c.                    ,
This act of New York, the mstructions-of Ma-
ryland, and a remonstrance of Vuginia, weie re-
ferred to a committee in Congress, who reported
a pieamble and resolutions thereon, which were
adopted on the 6ih September, 1780, so much of
which as is necessary to elucidate the subject is to
the following effect, viz:
" That it appears advisable to press upon those
States which can lemove the embarrassments re-
specting the western country a liberal surrender of
a portion of their territorial claims, since they can-
not be preserved entire without endangering the sta-
bility of the general Confederacy; to remind them
how indispensably necessary it is to establish the
Fedei al Union on a fixed and permanent basis, and
on principles acceptable to all Us respective mem-
bers, how essential to public credit and confidence,
to the suppoi t of our Army, to the vigor of our coun-
cils and success of our measures, to our tranquil-
lity at home, our reputation abroad, to our very
existence as a free, sovereign, and independent
people, that they aie fully persuaded the wisdom
of the seveial Legislatures will lead them to a full
and impaitial consideration of a subject so inter-
esting to the United States and so necessary to the
happy establishment of the Federal Union, that
they are confirmed in these expectations by a re-
view of the before-mentioned act of theLegislatui e
of New York, submitted to their consideration,"
&c
" Resolved, That copies of the several papers
referred to the committee be transmitted, with a
copy of the report, to the Legislatures of the several
S'ates; and that it be earnestly recommended to
those States who have claims to the westei n coun-
try to pass sucn laws and give then Delegates in
Congiess such powers as may effectually remove
the only obstacle to a final ratification of the Arti-
cles of Confederation; and that the Legislature of
Maryland be earnestly requested to authorize their
Delegates in Congress to subscribe the said Arti-
cles."
Following up this policy, Congress proceeded,
on the 10th of October, 1780, to pass a resolution
pledging the United States to the several States as
to the manner in which any lands that might be
ceded by them should be disposed of, the material
parts of which are as follows, viz.
"Resolved, That the unappropriated lands which
may be ceded or relinquished to the United States
by any particular State pursuant to the recom-
mendation of Congress of the 6th day of September
last, shall be disposed of for the common benefit
of the United States, and be settled and formed
into distinct republican States, which shall become
members of the Federal Union, and have the same
rights of sovereignty, freedom, and independence
as the other States,"&c. "That the said lands
shall be granted or settled at such times and under
such regulations as shall hereafter be agreed on by
the United States in Congress assembled, or nine
or more of them "
In February, 1781, the Legislature of Maryland
passed an act authorizing their Delegates m Con-
gress to sign the Articles of Confedeiation. The
following are extracts from the preamble and body
of the act, viz:
" Whereas it hath been said that the common
enemy is encouraged by this State not acceding to
the Confederation to hope that the union of the
sister States maybe dissolved,and therefore pios-
ecutes the war in expectation of an event so dis-
graceful to America-, and our friends and illustrious
ally are impressed with an idea that the common
cause would be promoted by our formally acceding
to the Confedeiation,"&e.
The act of which this is the preamble, author-
izes the Delegates of that State to sign the Articles,
and proceeds to declare "that, by acceding to the
said Confederation, this State doth not relinquish,
nor intend to relinquish, any right or interest she
hath, with the other United or Confederated States,
to the back country,"&c.,&c.
On the 1st of March, 1781, the Delegates of
Maryland signed the Articles of Confederation, and
the Federal Union under that compact was com-
plete. The conflicting claims to the western lands,
however, were not disposed of, and continued to
give great trouble to Congress. Repeated and
urgent calls were made by Congress upon the
States claiming them, to make liberal cessions to
the United States, and it was not until long after
the piesent Constitution was formed that the
grants were completed.
| The deed of cession from New York was exe-
cuted on the 1st of March, 1781, the day the Ar-
ticles of Confederation were ratified, and it was
accepted by Congress on the 29th October, 1782.
One of the conditions of this cession, thus tendered
and accepted, was, that the lands ceded to the
United States " shall be and enure for the uie and
benefit of such of the United States as shall become
members of the Federal Alliance of the said States, and
for no other me or purpose whatsoevei."
The Virginia deed of cession was executed and
accepted on the 1st day of March, 1784. One of
the conditions of this cession is as follows, viz:
"That all the lands withm the territory so ceded
to the United States, and not íeserved for, or ap-
propuated to, any of the before-mentioned pur-
poses, or disposed of in bounties to theofficeis and
soldiers of the American Army, shall be considered
as a common fund for the use and benefit of such of
the United States as have become, or shall become,
members of the Confederation or Federal Miance of
the said States, Virginia inclusive, according to their
usual respective proportions m the general charge and
expenditure, anil shall be faithfully and bona fide dis-
posed of for that purpose, and for no other use or pur-
pose whatsoever "
•Within the years 1785,1786, and 1787, Massa-
chusetts, Connecticut, and South Carolina, ceded
their claims upon similar conditions. The red-
eral Government went into operation under the
existing Constitution on the 4th of March, 1789
lhe following is the only provision of tnat Con-
stitution which has a direct bearing on the subieet
of the public lands, viz:
"The Congress shall have power to dispose of,
and make all needful rules and regulations respect-
ing the territory or other property belonging to
the United States, and nothing in this Constitution
shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of
the United States, or of any particular State "
Thus the Constitution left all the compacts be-
fore made in full force, and the rights of all parties
remained the same under the new Government as
they were under the Confederation.
The deed of cession of North Carolina was exe-
cuted in December, 1789, and accepted by an act
of Congress approved April 2, 1790 The third
condition of this cession was in the following
words, viz:
" That all the lands intended to be ceded by
virtue of this act to the United States of America,
and not appropriated as before-mentioned, shall be
considered as a common fund Jor the «s« andbenefdof
the United States of Jlmerica, Nor th Car olma inclu-
sive, according to their respective and usual propor-
tions of the general charge and expenditure, and shall
be faithfully disposed of for that purpose, and for no
other use or purpose whatever "
The cession of Georgia was completed on the
16th of June, 1802, and, in its leading condition, is
precisely like that of Virginia and North Carolina.
This grant completed the title of the United States
to all those lands, generally called public lands,
lying within the original limits of the Confederacy.
Those which have been acquired by the purchase
of Louisiana and Florida, having been paid for out
of the common tieasure of the United States, are
as much the property of theGeneral Government,
to be disposed of for the common benefit, as those
ceded by the several States.
By the fact3 here collected from the early his-
tory of our Republic, it appears that the subject
of the public lands entered into the elements ot its
institutions It was only upon the condition that
those lands should be considered as common prop-
erty, to be disposed of for the benefit of the United
States, that some of the States agreed to come into
a "perpetual union." The States claiming those
lands acceded to those views, and transferred their
claims to the United States upon certain specific
conditions, and on those conditions the grants were
accepted. These solemn compacts, invited by
Congress, in a resolution declaring the purposes
to which the proceeds of these lands should be
applied, originating before the Constitution, and
forming the basis on which it was made, bound
the United States to a particular course of policy
in relation to them by ties as strong as can be
invented to secure the faith of nations
As early as May, 1785, Congress, in execution
of these compacts, passed an ordinance providing
for the sales of lands in the Western Temtoiy
and directing the proceeds to be paid into the
Treasury of the United States With the same
object other ordinances were adopted puor to the
organization of the present Government.
In further execution of these compacts the
Congress of the United States, under the piesent
Constitution, as early as the 4th August, 1790, in
"An act making provision for the debt of the
United States," enacted as follows, viz-
" That the proceeds of sales which shall be made
oflandsintheWesteinTemtory, now belonging
or that may hereafter belong, to the United State?!
shall be, and are heieby, appropriated towards
sinking or discharging the debts for the payment
whereof the United States now are, or by virtue
of this act may be, holden, and shall be applied
solely to that use until the baid debt shall be fully
satisfied."                                                          '
To secuie to the Government of the United
fstates forever the power to execute these com-
pacts in good faith, theCongress of the Confedera-
tion, as early as July 13, 1787, m an ordinance
for the government of the temtory of the United
States northwest of the uver Ohio, prescribed to
the people inhabiting the Western Territory cei-
tam conditions which were declared to be " articles
of compact between the original States and the
peop e and States m the said territory," which
bhould " forever remain unalterable, unless by
common consent " In one of these articles it is
declared that—
"The Legislatures of thosedistricts or new States
shall never interfere wlth the primary disposal of
the soil by the United States m Congress assem-
bled, nor with any regulation Congress may find
