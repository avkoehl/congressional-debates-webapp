has before availed himself of a pre-emption right to the entry
of any of the public lands, and acquired a title thereto by rea-
son of such entry '
Mr RANDOLPH, who was entitled to the floor, opposed the
bill at some length
Mr HARRISON supported it with much energy, and went
thoroughly into an examination of the principles of the pre
emption system generally, and the necessity and equity of its
present application, replying to the objections, urged against it,
andceiendins the character of the settlers ñom tne aspersions
cast \ po j them
The 11 was further debated by Messrs LNDERWOOD,
JINCOLN, POPE, WILLIAMS of North Carolina, and
LVON
Mr MASON of Ohio opposed the bill at length, and in the
course oi hia remarks he appealed to Mr Casí-y of Illinois, as
a member of the Committee on the Public Lands, to say whe
ther any former Pxesident,inan annual message, had recom
mended a pre emption law
Mr CASEY replied that no President liad, ¡n an annual mes
sage, recommended the passage of a pre emption law, until the
present Executive m his last message had done so The !Ue
President, however, had lepeatedly recommeuded that the puce
of the public lands be reduced, and tin* the means be made
easy by which any actual settler on the public lands could be
enabled to secure ahorne freehold and fireside of hla own It
was scarcely necessaiy, perhaps, to add that Mi C was himself
w irmly m favor of both punciplesj that of pre emption, *nd
that of graduation, by which the tights of the United ¡States
were secured, and tho best interests of a wot thy class of cicucns
piomoted
Mr CR\RY followed at Ifngth upon the various topics
connected with the bill, and when he had concluded,
The a menu mew t ofh ledby Mr LINCOLN to (ho amendment

Mr GRUNDY rose <mdicmaiked that before tht Senate pm
ceeded to business, ho wished to occupy a tew tmnuUeo! its time
He rem&tked that, when he leachcdUie ¡senate oh im be i ycstei
day, the Senate wai in secret session, and so continued until
business required him to leave it late in tho evening, so that
this was the first opportunity piesentedto him of making a ft w
remalles in relation to his colleague's speech, which appeared
m the Intelligencer of yesterday, and had been made in the
Senate on the ¿Oth of April 1 ist The most of that apt %h Mr
G o id iic had heard, and md icphedto at the time lit was
eatisfiel with the íeply and evf lanationsas far as thev w< nt
The concluiín? remaila, of his colleague he had not heard
They were afterwards imperfectly htated to him by two gtn ie
men who had a better oppoit unity of hearing He hid Ct n
eluded to wait until the speech wa? publish* 1 lie piemimx 1 it
was truly lepovtcd, and he should now mike that bucl rep y
which ho should then have made hid he heard them in doing
ihw he should not be unmindful of what was due u> hinibclf, to
the -station he occup ed, or to the place he was in
He said he wo ¡id am-wei that, so fat as his colleague had
thrown any petsnnal imputations upon him he threw tl em
from him with all that disdain and scorn they merited, and lie
must asstue his colleague tint, be was sorry to say, the
harsh, unqutlified, an 3 imfivorab'e opinion he had th night
proper to express of him, (Mr G ) was fully ret lprocated, with
a single qualification, which was that he hoped it was accompa*
nied with less ill will and moie cause
He considered it foit mite that hi? colleague was not the
judge upon whose opinions his (Mi G ,o) standing, and wel-
fare, in Ufe depended Were it m, he should much fear that
what might reasonably be expected from his sense of justice
would be entirely lost in the predominance of his prejudices and
passions
He regretted that he had been compelled to interrupt the
business of the Senate for a moment, with any thing that re
lated to himself He could not havesaid less, and he had no desire
to?ay more, unless he was placed under  like necessity; and jn
the event of such an occurrence, he should ask the indulgence
of the Senate, and he trusted it would not be withheld
After he took his seat-
Mr WHITI replied in an animated manner, when
Mr GRUNDY proceeded in like manner, and at considerable
length, when he was called to order by the President of the
Senate, who declared that the discussion mus* stop, and; there
upon, Mr   G  inquired if he was required to take his seat
Upon being answeiedm the affirmative, Mr G said he obeyed,
and afterwaido—
Mr WHITE was permitted to explain a circumstance in his
own conduct, and then the Senate proceeded to business
The CHAIR announced a communication from the Secretary
af Was, transrmturg a repon from the Colonel of the Ord
nance Department, furnishing the information requued by the
act of yd April, 1794, which was laid on the table
The CHAIR also communicated a report from (he Secretary

justice had not induced the Senatot from Connecticut, upon

to make the imende honorable, by withdrawing his imputa

11 ISew York uV IegMitmefelt it«e!f imperaüveiy called
upon to alter the law of the State, and authorize, at least fora
time, the i«sue of Mnall bills The popul ir branch of the Le
eislature was nearly unanimous for an unqualified repeal
The Senate prefuied a bU^pension, and a suspension was the
final result
It is idmiited, I believe, on all hands, tint this measure was
called for by the pt orle if was not the result of any lank
management, oi of the operation of any pmate interests what
t.vei Itwastleiesultofaclear loud, and irresistible demand
of the public will It cannot be charged to party, to manage
ment oi to anything but a universal conviction that the mea
eyre wouls be uwful and «vas necessary Its beneficial effects
are not doubted, I believe, by any body, m aiding the banks m
the great woik of resumption    Now, I suppose that all the
banks in New Yoik, with, perhaps, two oi three exceptions
in the city, have availed themselves of this suspension law, and
have issued small bills Their notes, theiefore, cannot be re
ceived at the custom house, or the post office, or elsewhere,
where debts to Government are to be paid I suppose the
same state of things exists in INew Jersey, and many othei
States, both Atlantic and Western
I have said on a former occas on and I still think that the
measures pursued by Government have overthrown, at
least for the present, us own policy of discontinuing tht; use of
small bills A ^tate of things ha? arisen in which the people of
States which had begun to act on that i obey have compelled
their Legislatures to give u) the attempt for the present In
someinstances, the laws against small notes ha\e been íepeal
ed, m otheis, modified or suspended All this, Iiepeat, has
been the woik ofthe people themselves, acting directly on then
own Legislatures Undei existing cncumstauces, they find
small hills useful, if not mdispensa! c And as (here is no rea
son to doubt the solvency ofthe banks which iss e«uch notes,
more than ttuu ot o hers, the question maybe asked, ?sit is
asked, with signifiearcy am1 effect by the committee ol the as
sotntcd banks in Bostcn, "wlw not put thenoteb of all specie
paying banks on the same ground1'
I think, mi, it is the duty of Guvunmuit, at thp present un
poitant moment, to extend a laige ml hbci tl confidence to the
bankb and toencounge their efTortb, and assist their struecles
foi resumption by ill propei means To this end I think the
prohibition contained m the fifth section of the deposite law
ought tobe lepedtd or sispended f r a t-onailerab c time, and
until encum-stances shall favn a leneweti attempt to sustain
the policy hereto! it- puisutd I am ul oj u ion that it it  not
enougn merely to abolish tlu mci¡ac(> ni^infffiom what has

ple will not consent tint they should 11ns is a point 1 he
heve, on which there is hut Utile d fierence if opinion in thote
States in whuh small notesaie ís&ued
On the whole, my opinion is, that the bes thing to bt. done,
under all cncumsiances, is to repeal the prohibition and to wait
for a more favorable opportunity to establish the policy which
it w is intended to sustain 1 hope we miv see our way on this
subject somewhat clearer some time hence than we now see it
If a repeal, howevei,beob|t.cted to, asusj ension isfindispensa*

But if a suspension only be igited to «md i (''ay fixed when it
