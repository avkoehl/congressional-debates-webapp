HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, SIXTH CORPS,February 17, 1865.

Brigadier General R. S. MACKENZIE,

Commanding Second Brigade:

GENERAL: General Penrose has just called to say that he assumes command of the division by authority of General Wright, who told him that, as you and he were of the same date of appointment as brevet brigadier-general, the question of rank reverted back to your respective colonelcies, and, by virtue of his seniority as colonel, he was entitled to the command. General Wright said that, as he was assigned to duty with his brevet rank, he was entitled to all the immunities and privileges of a full brigadier, and therefore ranked you. I would have reported this in person, but the condition of the roads is my apology. General Penrose directed me to inform you as early as possible, so that, if there is any question on the subject, you could see General Wright without delay.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. CLENDENIN, JR.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,February 17, 1865. (Received 10.05 a. m.)

Bvt. Major General A. S. WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

No movement of troops on our front. The cannonading yesterday morning was brought about by our people shelling a camp. In the afternoon the enemy opened quite briskly on the Fort Sedgwick mortar line, I presume in retaliation.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HDQRS. ARTILLERY BRIGADE, NINTH ARMY CORPS,February 17, 1865.

General HUNT,

Chief of Artillery, Army of the Potomac:

The firing yesterday was mostly from the enemy and from the front of Fort Sedgwick. Soon after the enemy opened, the mortars in Battery 20 replied, and after a few shots were opened upon by two of the enemy's mortar batteries to front and right of Sedgwick. The enemy opened with more mortars than heretofore from this point. No casualties.

JNO. C. TIDBALL.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES,February 17, 1865.

General RAWLINS:

It was the flag-boat William Allison which was blown up. She went down almost immediately. There were no prisoners going up in her. Another rebel steam-boat was near. No survivors were seen by our pickets.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
