CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

Richmond, Va., April 2, 1864.

Lieutenant General L. POLK,

Commanding, Demopolis, Ala.:

GENERAL: The Bureau of Subsistence has a confidential contract with Mr. William J. Stoddard, of Alabama, for getting meat from the north side of the Tennessee River into our lines. Mr. Stoddard writes that he has already a permit for 20,000 pounds of bacon, and says his agent thinks he can obtain a large amount provided he (Stoddard) can protect a steam-boat to bring it up the Tennessee River, but that he had no authority to protect his boat. Mr. Stoddard will be instructed to see you and lay his contract before you. I am not prepared to recommend protection to a boat on the Tennessee unless laden with a much larger amount of subsistence or other stores for the Government or without ample assurance of the loyalty of the captain and parties controlling it. You will, however, be better prepared to judge whether any and what protection should be allowed, and the matter is submitted with confidence to your discretion and superior knowledge of the circumstances.

Very respectfully, yours,

JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
