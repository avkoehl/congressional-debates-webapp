Colonel W. A. NICHOLS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.:

Through your Department I am in receipt of a communication from Mrs. P. Y. Cutler asking a pass to Winchester. If Mrs. Cutler will inform me who wrote the letter urging her to hasten with her relief she can come and see me. A lade so easily deceived is safest at home. The worst case of distress in this Valley was the case of old Mr. Hupp, who lives near Strasburg. I issued to him thirty days' rations, and afterward found that he had six months' supplies buried; two sons in rebel army; and at one time Mr. White, one of my scouts, found $ 10,000 in gold under his floor, and a sword that belonged to Stonewall Jackson. The gold was returned to him, and he has not since lost it, unless he sent it South.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

This was on the Little River pike, one mile from Could's Mill. I have sent a copy of this dispatch to Colonel Gamble, and have sent what cavalry I have in pursuit.
