GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. THIRD DIV., 18TH ARMY CORPS,

No. 103. Before Richmond, Va., October 7, 1864.

OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS OF THIS DIVISION:

Major-General Birney, commanding Tenth Corps, has desired me to express to you the high satisfaction he felt at your good conduct while we were serving with the Tenth Corps, September 29 and 30, and with your gallantry in storming New Market Heights. I have delayed issuing this order, hoping for an opportunity to say this to you in person. Accept also my own thanks for your gallantry on September 29 and your good conduct since. You have the good opinion of the whole Army of the James and of every one who knows your deeds. Let every officer and man on all occasions exert himself to increase your present deserved reputation.

CHAS. J. PAINE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

October 7, 1864.

Colonel POTTER:

Do not open if the enemy's gun-boats do not fire. The signal officer on your right reports a new embrasure near Howlett's. Keep a sharp lookout in that direction.

GEO. A. KENSEL,

Chief of Staff.

JONES' LANDING, October 7, 1864.

General BUTLER:

My vedette line on the New Market road reports that rebel cavalry and infantry are moving down to the right of Spring Hill. No troops there, save fifty or sixty cavalry.

ARNOLD A. RAND,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,October 7, 1864 - 7.15 p. m.

General KAUTZ:

I grieve for your loss. You do not state what loss you inflicted on the enemy. The enemy attacked General Birney's right; were repulsed with slaughter, with a loss of 1,000 killed and wounded and 100 prisoners. Birney then took the offensive and drove them back, and now holds your old line with a division of infantry.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,October 7, 1864.

Brigadier-General KAUTZ:

General Terry, with such troops as he has under his command, holds your old position. You will move up your command just before day, and, reporting to him for this purpose, take position to strengthen his right and flanks.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
