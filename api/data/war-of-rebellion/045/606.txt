between Funkstown and Williamsport. I have just received information that he has driven in my cavalry force in front of Boonsborough. My army is and has been making forced marches, short of rations and barefooted. One corps marched yesterday and last night 30 miles. I take occasion to repeat that I will use my utmost effort to push forward this army.

General WARREN:

I have just learned that, in obedience to your orders direct to the depot at Washington, the necessary trucks and wagons for 1, 000 feet of bridge were started with our own animals, to be hauled up by land to-day. I fear they cannot possibly reach here as soon as the trucks might have done by railroad, but if the animals are not too much exhausted, we shall not probably need those I expected to call for from General Ingalls.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inform you that one division of my corps is at Burkittsville and the other at Jefferson. The Second Corps is now in camp for the night about 4 miles from here, and has been ordered forward at 5 a. m. to-morrow.

FREDERICK, July 8, 1863.

General G. K. WARREN,

Acting Chief of Staff:

Went over both gaps on the mountain. The roads are frightful. Colonel Reynolds has been trying all day to get the Sixth Corps batteries over. It will take until to-morrow noon before he is entirely across, and then the horses will be unfit for use. The trains have all gone to Frederick. None attempted the Mountain road to-day. General Humphreys will be there about 10 o'clock. I met him at 7. 30, 2 miles out of town, going to Middletown.

Lieutenant, &amp;c.,
