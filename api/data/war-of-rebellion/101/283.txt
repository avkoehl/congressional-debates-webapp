Statement of Washington Fulton, teamster in Government employ.

I, Washington Fulton, teamster in the employment of the Government, being duly sworn, do say that I was driving a Government team of six mules en route from For Leavenworth, Kans., to Fort Kearny, Nebr. Ter., transporting unarmed soldiers sent from hospitals and guardhouse at Fort Leavenworth, and that about two miles east of Elm Creek Stage Station, Nebr. Ter., the soldiers who wee with me were attacked by a body of Indians, numbering fifteen or twenty, about 2 p. m. on the 18th day of May, 1865, and 2 of the soldiers killed and 6 wounded, including myself. One soldier of the Third U. S. Volunteers, after being struck twice with a U. S. saber which they (the Indians) had in their possession, was knocked down and scalped by and Indian, they knowing hm to be alive. After he was scalped the Indians kicked him twice. Two or three Indians were dressed in old Government pantaloons, others in buckskin leggings. The Indian who had charge of the party attacking us wore buckskin leggings. His hair was long and had some kind of fur attached to his back hair. He was the only Indian who had long hair; he also had a revolver. Two of the attacking party had short hair "roached" on top of their heads. These two said they were friendly Sioux, but were as outrageous as any in their attack on us. I was about ten rods from the man who was scalped. Cannot say how all the Indians were dressed, nor give any particular description of them, but can identify one of them if I see him. One of them, the Indian who scalped the soldier, had a large scar over his eye; whether right or left eye I cannot say.
