HDQRS. DISTRICT OF GEORGIA, ORDNANCE OFFICE,Savannah, March 17, 1863.

The foregoing is a list of all the ordnance in position in this military district, but does not include the seven light batteries nor the guns in store, which are all field pieces I believe, and few in number. I would particularly call attention to the fact that there are but five 10-inch columbiads and thirteen 8-inch columbiads in this district, while there are fourteen heavy batteries.

Respectfully submitted.

WM. D. HARDEN,

First Lieutenant Artillery and Ordnance Officer.
