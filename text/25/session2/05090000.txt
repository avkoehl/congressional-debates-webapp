Mi BUCHANAN lose and obsened fluí he yesterday e. t\t
notice that ho would to day, immuliitt' ly altet the leading oi
the journal, call up the resolution of the House ¡ixini: the day
of the adjournment oi Congiese He now moved to take it
up
This motion having been carried, and the resolution being
before the ¡senate,
Mr BENTON said that he should move to postpone na
further consideration until Monday  «t, and aski d for the Venn
and nays on that question We have, said Mr B hem hum
nearly seven months, and billa oi the highest moment to tin
country weie yet unacted on He was, thereloto, not wiiltn,
to risk the loss ol ¡hose bills by an adjournment to a day eer
two, and by retaining, said he, the resolution in out pos*) 
slon for this week, to sea whether these bills will be acied on
we shall be just as iar advanced on Monday as wo now are
He had particularly in his eye the billl i lucre isetho ninkaol
the army—a bill which they had seen the ne n*tai} of acting
on for years It was not usual to spe ik of what vv is dont in
the other house, but it was tiototioiu, linuttilic list si-moti
tills bill hiving been kepi b irk mull almost the lu-~i monu m,
a member ihiejtened, if it was tout bed in spink out the week
against it. Thoie was also the giaduuwii bill, anotli i imp r
tant measure, wlmh he thouehtit impouant should be at ted
on Wo are sent hove, said Mr B to woi k, mid m t to sit
here foi a given numbei of d lys He was foi doing the public
work, and after it wuj done, lot adj mining, but he w m ntieil>
opposed to binding himself to utljouiu lya cci tain thy, and
thus risk the loss of bills necessary for tht service of the emm
try, which were now íeady for actum He iu.ki d loi Uie veas
and nays on. thisquestion, tu oulei tint it might beseen ih it hi
was against lieking tlie loss of bills impoiuutioi tin stu te
of the country
Mr GRUND'i said it would be recollected (hat «hen tin
resolution fixing thepeuod oi adjournment had bt en introduced
m the Senate, he was among the foiemost m opposing it i atlop
non At that time he viewed it is m ¡mpropei.arrathei an ill
timed, measure He waa desirous that eveiy thing mat* «a! to
the great inteiests of the uation should have been acted on be
fore the a jotimniciit was ugnated He consldt led that the in
traduction of such matteis more appropriately belonged to the
popular branch, andit best became the ^ nato to wait until that
body said it could dispose ofthe public businer  The House of
Representatives has now informed us that it has (wished ih
business, or at least will be read? iodo to by the 9th of July
In relation to the subject mentioned by tht damnable hen it n
fiom Missouri, he was as anxious, thai n should be maimed
as any man could be, but, said Mr G when the Hnnv hai told
us that ií toifl finish all lis business aid be ready to adjournal
the period specified, I do not see wuh what piopnety we cm
vote for any further postponement
Mr IJTJCHANAN said that he wjs glad that the Senator from
Missouri bail called for the yeas and nays, and he should most
cheerfully vote for them He believed, at the time, that if Ins
trien! from Alabama fMr Krws] had prosecuted the resolution
introtacediby mm/wub his usual perseverance, ana the dav had
been fixed  forthe adjournment, they would have been -jsreadv
toadjourrt by that day as they now were,or should be by the
■9th of Augost next>tf flfey now postponed the resolution One
thing his experience fead taught him you never, said he, go
earnestly and ¡sealougtyttj worjttiil you knew when the session
is to terminate Fix ttte,itoyj!fadjoummeni.now,and it would
operarte aa an inceptive to the iwo Houses to finish the business
féferes them   He woBWDKuaihiioriy aa-any man that the army
bill should be lost But can we, said be, tell the Hou¡.e that
they did not know the state of their own business when they
passed this resolution, and, though it was passed by a majority
of two tojone, we will notjagree toil—our refusal not being lor
the purposo of doing our own business, but for the purpose of
giv ing them longer time to do theirs If, said Mr 8 you post-
pone this resolution for one week, you necessarily postpone the
adjournment, where is if you take the House at its word, and
pass the resolution now, they will go earnestly to work, and
complete their business by the day fixed This resolution was
adoptcil in the House by a majority of two to one, and the plain
construction of a relusal to adupt it here would be an intimation
to that bodv that ittlid not know what time it would require to
complete its t wn business It would be virtually leihng them,
that by adiourmngon theday they had fixed, they would vio
late theii duty, and lose the army bill, as well as other bills im
purtant to the country Tor these reasons he was opposed to
the postponement ami should vote against it
Mr BLN1 ON said that the opinions advanced by the bono
rabio gentleman fiom Pennsylvania wi ie not, m his view, jus
tilled by experience The theory of no work, lllllil after the
ilny of adjournment was fixed, was promptly contradicted by
the existing suite of Mew He might rppeai to the fcenaie to
sustain linn m Uie assi rtlon '1 hat body, without any day fix
