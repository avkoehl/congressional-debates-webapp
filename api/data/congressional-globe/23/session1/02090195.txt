vate life, exercised through the brokers and money
lendeis
Mr T came to the conclusion that the deposites
ought to be restored, and that the Constitution
ought to be amended so as to allow a Bank of the
United States to be established—that was his only
objection to it Let this be done, and it would en-
able Congress to confer the greatest possible benefit
on posterity, and put to íest a question which
would nevei be settled in any other way The
considerations for the amendment were groat and
powerful—and it could be effected before the expi-
ration of the bank charter, so that the present bank
might be rechartered, ora bill for another passed
Mr T concluded by contrasting the republican-
ism of Mr Jefferson with that of the present
Administration, and condemning the principles of
the proclamation
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, February 24, 1834
Mr  PARKS rose and said:
Mr Speaker I am requested to present a me-
morial, report, and resolutions, adopted at a meet-
ing convened, as it is said, without distinction of
patty, in the town of Bangor, in Maine,and whicn
memorial is signed by two hundied and eighty-
eight inhabitants of said town, praying ioi a
recharter of the present Bank of the United States,
or that another, on similar principles, may be
chartered
Before, sir, passing this memorial to the Chan,
there are a few observations which I feel myseli
called upon to make, not only on the subject mat
tei of the papers themselves, but as legards the
relation in winch I stand to the petitioneis
The town, su, from which this memorial comes,
has, for a numbei of years past, been progressing
in a state of flout islung prosperity, such as has
seldom been equalled, never suipassed, in New
England It now contains, sir, six thousand
people, all actively engaged in commercial pui-
suits, and the various avocations incident thereto
It is from a town so ciicumstanced that this
memorial, signed by two hundied and eighty-eight
only of its citizens, comes
It is professed, Mr Speaker, that the meeting
where this memorial was got up was called with-
out distinction of party It is no doubt tiue, su,
that it was so called, but it is not tiue that it was
bo attended It was a political meeting, got up foi
political purposes, and attended by one political
party only I wul not undertake to say, sir, that
no roan was there who ever gave a vote in favoi of
the Administration There is, sir, in eveiy com-
munity wheie po'ltical parties run high, some
few persons without any fixed opinions, who aie
always vacillating from one party to the othei, as
the one or other may to them seem to prepondei-
ate in power and strength That some such per
sonc, wno may have occasionally given a vote to
the Admimstiation, were piesent, and acting on
that occasion, I do not deny Bu', su, / do duty
that any onefiim fr end of the Admui'straion was
present acting there Sir, the attempt was made
to give this meeting the appearance of being what
it purports to be, " without distinction of party,"
but putting on to a committee thiee gentlemen,
friends of the Administration, whom 1 am glad to
call such, and with whom I am always prouu to
act I have before me, su, one of the daily papers,
of that town, in which those gentlemen state that
their names were made use of without their know!
edge or consent, and they add, further, that "they
' regret that any of then cit zens aie disposed to
' counterance oi approve tne course puisued by
'the United States Bank, in its unhallowed at
' tempts to perpetuate its power by its oppression,
' and that they can nevei lend their tad, howevei
' feeble, to aggravate the public distress which that
' institution is attempting everywhere to produce "
So much, su, with regaid to its being without
distinction of paity
Allow me now, Mr, to call the attention of the
House to some of the statements and ednussions
in the report and resolutions In the first place,
these petmoijeis say, and very truly so, that there
has been no unusual piessure in Bangoi—that
there has been no failures, but nuchas might have
nappened in ordinary times Sn, from the very
hatuie of the business of Bangoi, it is impossible
i there could have been any pressure of a very se-
I nous nature there    The principal of the business
! of that place is the lumber tiade, the lumlei is
cut in the winter, brought down the river in the
spring, manufactured, and sent to market during
the summer    During the winter season nature
I lays a very effectual embargo on the foreign com
I merce of that poit, by closing the river foi miles
below with ice     The goods, therefore, which aie
wanted for the winter consumption are  brought
there in the fall, and no payments, to any amount,
are either expected or promised to be made until
the produce of their winter's work is ready to be
shipped foi market in the spring and summer.
But these memorialists state further, that al-
though there has been no pressure as yet, they fear
there may be I am not, sir, entnely without ap-
prehension of that event myself, but, sir, there are
othei causes to which, if such an event happens,
Í can ascribe it, as well as to the íemoval of the
deposites, or to the deranged state of the currency
Until within a very few yeais, Mr Speaker, the
immense resources for tiade and enterprise of
every description which are to be found in the
Penobscot section of Maine, appear to have been
passed by unheeded and unknown It appeared
that, as if by magic, the veil which had lntl eito
concealed them from the eyes of men had suddenly
been lifted, and as if all the advantages and op
portunmes for enterprise, which were so abundant,
were for the first time made known Wealth,
population, en tei prise of eveiy character flowed
n upon us Everything seemed as if touched by
Midas to be turned to gold This state of things
has continued to the piesent hour, so lhat instead
of suffeung, a state of actual piospenty has ex
isted, such as I nevei saw befoie,and had nevei
supposed to be capable of existing In such a state
of affairs, a populalion composed principally of
active, enterprising young men, would naturally,
with new inducements daily opening before them,
extend their opeiatioiib to the full extent of then
means and ciedit No evil has yet resulted iiom
this state of things, it has been supported by the
ample resources whiüihave been liouily developed,
and, sn, the piQbabih y is, that these will still
support it But there is always danger lest some
in such a state of affairs, should overtrade There
foie it is not impossible, although vn/nobable, that
some of the fears entertained by these memonahsts
may be well grounded
In the next plac", sn , these memonahsts go on
to say, that even if theie had been any pressuie
among them, they should not have known what
cause to have assigned foi it, whether it was the
conduci of the bai k, or the couise of the Presi
dent The i ommittee even say that that was a
question upon which they differed so much that
they concluded to leave it as they found it So,
sir, with regard to the question whethei <he hank
has foi felted its charter, wnethei it has fulfilled
its duty to the country or not—all these ques
tion«, and others of a similar character, they con-
clude to leave undecided, and yet, Mr Speaker,
they ask this Congress to rechaiter a Lank whose
conduct, according to their own account of it,
may well be consideied a matter of doubt and
suspicion
1 here is one other matter heie, Mr Speaker, to
which 1 wish to allude In the papéis, sir, which
1 am about to piesent, lmmed ate «ciion is asked
for The memonahsts, sir, and the persons who
attended that meeting, are most faithful and tnor
ough going paitv men, they live, sir, in a remote
quaitei ot the Union, and we aie now receiving
from tl em the'cho of the petition of the advocate 
of the bank, on the flooi of this House, at the
commencement of this session, asking foi action,
action, no matter whf t it might be Sir, had the
peisons who got up that meeting and this m-mo-
ual known that the ft lends of the bark on this
floor had changed their course of policy, and that
they had, from the beginning of the session, voted
<^ra(ii5i action, and for some time past ceased to
ask for it, these same pei=ons, sir, who have here
asked for action, would have begged fpr delay,
investigation, debate, till doomsday, and in so
doing, would have acted with no more inconsist-
ency than their friends upon this floor
One subject more, Mr Speaker, and I have
done, and that, su, is of so extraordinary a char-
acter, coming fiom the source it does, that I must
J ask leave of the House to read the resolution to
I which I refei     It is as follows
"Uesolted, That the custody and control of the
' public money was never intended by the Consti-
' tution to be intrusted exclusively to the President
' of the United States, and when they considered
' this powei in connexion with the extraordinary
' military powei granted to that officer by Congress
' last session, slight memorials, indeed, seemed to
'íemaiti cither in the people or in the States, of
' fteedom, sovereignty, and independence."
And this íesolution, Mr Speaker, has been
adopted by men who are consolidauonists, who
last year Claimed the Piesident as llinr President
The very men, sir, who defended and insisted
upon excluuvely jiatifymg and svppoiting that very
grant of powei, as an act based upon the princi-
ples of the party to which they belong Sir, my
feeble voice was drowned among the shouts of
triumph which they uttered " Redeunt saturnia
iegna" was their cry then But there has been,
su, a wonderful change of opinion in these people
on this subject within a very few months. I know
not, sir, to what this íemarkable alteration can be
attributed, but to the equally remarkable union
that has evidently taken place in this House
between'the ultras of the North and those of the
South, heretofore antipodes in principle, and that
these my woithy constituents are willing to con-
summate the alliance by a total abandonment of
all then owi principles and the adoption of those
of nullification, as remarkable a counteimarch of
opinion, within thiee short months, as can be
found mall the annals of history What advantage
is to I e gamed by all this, beyond a meie united
opposition to tne presentAdministiation.is beyond
my power to peiceive. Their creed to this mo-
ment has always been, that the General Govern-
ment cannot have too much power, noi the States
too little This íesolution, sir, is from the veiy
men who opposed my election to a seat in this
House, upon the alleged giound of my being a
nullifier, and an opponent of the bank Sir, there
was no sulject upon witch the opinions of the
people of the chslrict I have the honor to represent
upon this flooi are more decidedly formed than
upon that of the Bank of the United States As
to nullification, they knew there was none of it in
Maine The result, s,i, was my return to this
House by a majority of nearly seventeen hundred
votes 1 ahucie to this, sn, simply as showing the
opinions of the people of my district upon the sub-
ject of the bank 1 am not vain enough nor fool-
ish enough to suppose that that result was owing
to any personal popularity Let my opinion on the
sul ject of the bank have been but favorable to it,
and I should have been defeated by a large major-
ity, and vei y possibly larger than that by which I
was elected Sn,theieaie from fifteen to eighteen
hundied voters in the town of Bangor, a majority
of them were opposed to the Admimstiation; an
active committee was appointed to obtain signa-
tures to this memorial, they have pi evented heie
the names of only two hundied and eighty eight
persons What must be the inference' I, sir,
need not state it
Sir, when I had the honor the other day to pre-
sent the resolutions of the Legisia'uie of the State
of Mame, I avowed myself an advocate foi State
rights, and of the Vnginia constiuction of the Con-
stitution My colleague [Mi E\a\í,J m replying
to my observations, asked, in a veiy significant
mannei, whut are the doctunes c f Viigima nou, ?
Sir, it is not for nt to answei for Virginia, but if,
ua he intimated, Virginia has forgotten or lepu
diated the doctrines of her JefTersons arel hei Mad-
isons, I thank God, sir, theie aie some States who
have not forgotten tl em, but who still remember
them, and believe them the orly construction of
the Constitution which can puserve the rights and
liberties of a free and happy people In conclu-
sion, Mi Speaker, I shall merely move to refer
these papers to the Committee of Ways and Means
I shall not move for then printing, they are, in my
opinion,inconsistent and confiadictory,and dono
honor to the hand that penned them, the commit-
tee that leported them, the meeting that adopted
them, nor to the citirens who signed the memorial
If, however, my colleague, or anv other, shall
choose to move the printing, i shall make no objec-
tion, but in that case lequest that the names to the
memorial be likewise printed
