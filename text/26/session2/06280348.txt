' '26th Cong_____2nd Sess"                           Causes of the Florida War—Mr. Giddings.______________________            H. oi RePs*
jiistly and fairly eieented. This cannot be done
until the bands of outlaws (fugitive slaves) men-
tioned in the agent's report are artested and broken
up; for, so long as they are permitted lo remain,
every Indian that is unwilling to emigrate willseek
their protection." No man, perhaps, possessed
better knowledge of these facts than Governor Du-
val, who assures us that the negroes controlled the
Indians, and that the Indians sought the p! otee ion
and support of the fugitive slaves He lurther as
sures us that nothing could be done while th >se fu-
gitive slaves were permitted to remain in F onda
If gentlemen wilt bear this advice n mind, they
Will better understand the policy that subsequently
guided our army against the Indians
In a letter dated January 26, ld34, Gov. Duval
says: "The «laves belonging to the ludíais, must be
made to fear for themselves before tney ** ni cease
to influence the minds of 'heir mas'ers " You may
be assured (says he) that the fir--t step towards the
emigration of these Indians must be the breaking
up of the runaway slaves and outlaw Indnns "
Thus we are informed that the war must be first
waged against the fugitive slaves Perrnps I ought
'O explain that slavery among th  Indians is veiy
different from what it is among the whiles It is
comparative independence Hence the slaves of
the Indians have a perfect horror oi slavery amrng
th« white people. Of course the iugttive slaves and
the Indian slaves become intimate friend*, nd act
in concert for the liberty of all
[Mr.Campbull of South  Chroma called Mi
G-iDDiNOS to order, and stated that the member from
Ohio was evidently as>aihng mdrectly at institu-
tion which, by the rules of the House, was not lia-
ble to be assayed.
The Chairman said that the gentleman from
Ohio had expressed his intention to discos the
Flenda war, and he had unders ood the remarks
as having referei ca to that sutject The Chair
could not attribute a diííirpnt motn p from tiat
express-d by th° gentleman himself I am (--a d
he) therefore corsiramed to say the gentleman from
Ohio i  in ordi r ]
Mr Giddings resumed. I was not av are, Mr
Chairman, tha our rules piotected from di cusston
any institution whatever 1 will, however, a sure
the gentleman from South Carolina that I shall
only al ude to the subject of slavery so far as it
stand ! connected with the Fior da war That, -o
far as it ha* been the means of drawing forty mil-
lions of dollars from the public Treisury, and
most of it from the free S aies-, I intend to assail
it, and no further Governor Duval says "ihe e
slaves must first be made to fear for themselves "
The war was first to be waged a amst <"iaves, fi r
the reason that thpy influence 1 the ípinds of their
master  m favoi of liberty In other words, the
warmuu be directed again,! the ri'htof asHve to
express his mind lo his Indian master on the sub
)eet of human rights Sir, these sli-ves were m,-de
to fear for themselves in pursuinee of th^se inn
mations of Governor Duva', as I will i ow en lea-
ver to sh/w ihts committee On the 28 h October
1834, Geaersl Thompson, m a letter addre spa to
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, says ' There
are many very 1 kely mgrre in this inn n, (Semi-
nole ) Some or ihe wh tc m the anient set 1p
menu manife t a lestVss dp«ire to ebun them,
and I have no doubt that Indian riel ppgrots are
now in possesion of ihe whites" Thus, sir> ,t
seems that kJrappmp was not unltnovtr in that
country. This «iiie General Thompson, t! e ?c-
credited officpr of this Government, on the 9 n
January, 1831}, advises Government " h?t ?n a-
pedmon sh< Eldle set on foot rcr ti-p doubt  pul-
póse of duung the Indians w m n thtir boundary,
and to capture ne<?ro s rmny i f whom it is be-
lieved are runaway slates" Aril, s r, our armv
was put in motion to capture negree   nd s'a/'s,
as we shall find in the sequel But I wish t  call
the attention of tie committee for a lew momen s
to the manner in which the e s)aves, in the voids
of Governor Duval, were "made to lear frr t en-
selves " On the 28th July, 1835 J hn Wa'bei,
one of the Appalachicola chiets belonging to the
Seminole band, wrote Gen. Thompson, Indian
agent, as follows*
"I am (says he) induced to write you m consequence of the
depredations making, and attempted to be made, upon my pro
pcrty, by a company of negro stealers some of whom are
fiom Columbus Georgia, and h-we connected themselves with
Blown and Douglas I should like your adv ce how 1 am to
act I dislike to make any trouble or to have any difficulty
with any of the white people But, it they trespass upon my
piemi eg and my rights I must defend myself m the hpst way
I can If tney do mak" this attempt -and I have no doubt they
will—they must bear the consequences But i  there no civil
la*r to protect met Ate the free negroes and the nc£ioes be
longm? ¡n this town to be stolen awav pubticly and, m the face
of all law and justice, earned off and sold to hit the pockets of
the-" wot e than land puates? Douglass and his company
hired a man who has two large trame 1 dogs foi the pmpo=e to
come down and take Bi ley He is from Mobile and follows
foi a livelihood catching lunaway negroes '
This, sir, is the language of a savage, addressed
to his civil ztd neighbors He called in vain for
protection A few days after the date of thu let-
ter he was robbed of all hi* negroes, so says the
report of the United Sta'ea attorney, addressed to
the Secretary of War, ?nd dated Apnl 91, 1836
But of Lie number of freemen lud apped at the
same time we a e not ímormed Ai all events,
"thesiavts ei" wad" to isur for themsehes," as
Governor Duval advised. Can we wonder that
these Indian, were driven to acts of desperation'
Here, sir, is the first mention 1 have met of the
us* of 'bioodhounds" in fins Florida war. They
were used by "negro stPa'er-.," for the purpose (f
catch.ng ihe colored people of Florida, aid ojr of-
ficers hate copied the example But I intend giv-
ing furiher examples cf the use of bloodhounds be-
firelclose I hate, however, no time for com-
ment My object is to place facts before the pee-
ple of this nation, and let every man make his own
comment's, and draw hn own conclusions 1 will
give one more example of the mode of ' teaching
¿laves to fear for theruselvt " E-coii ch-tt mico
was also an Indian chief of the Seminole band,
living upon the Anpalaehicola river, and wis per-
haps one who s^t.ed the treaty at Cam,* Moidtrie
in 1832 by which we s lemnly pledged the faith
of th s nation to protect ihe Indians in the enjo)-
ment of their lives an! prr^erty This chiet is

th« liberty of the b'acks and the rights of the In-
dians Indi ed, it seems to have been fn obpet
with some of the officers emplojed in Fionda to
induce Government itself to enter into the business
of capturing and selling slaves. J. W Hams,
disbursing agent of Government, in a letter to the
Commissary General of Subsistence, dated Decem-
ber 30, 1836, says "I would iespectrully suggest
that you recommend to the honorable Secretary tf
War that the annuity due to the hostile Indians be
rétame 1 to defray the expenses of this war; and
iha' the s'ave-s who shell be captured, whom I bs-
lieve to have been generally active instigators to
our present troubles, be sold at public sale, and the
proceeds appropriated to the same object " Thii
is the first i fficial propo ition that has; come to my
knowledge for the Government to enter into com-
petition v>thth>* "negro stealers," by ciptunrg
and selling slates. At the time this suggestion was
made, we weie ensased m open war with these
people, who had s mpht liberty m the wilds of Flo-
rida If they were captured, they would be p l-
soner  of war, and for u  to «ell them as slaves
would be as much a violation of our national honor
as it would have been fo' them to have sold as
slaves such of our ptople as they were able to cap-
ture
I may perhaps be permuted to rema'k that,
among the people of the free States, nothing is re-
garded wuh so much disgust and abhorrence as
buying and selling of men, women, and children,
and that this feehn^ is common among all classes
and all political parties
Mr. Chairman, I have called the attention of the
commit'ee to what is officially announced as the
first and principal cause of this war, and a'so to
some of the próxima e and immediate causes. I
think no man can doubt that it originated in the
atomptsof the Executive to support slavery by
the it fluence and efforts of our national Govern-
ment in violation, as I think, of the Constitution
and of the rights of the free States I propose to
investigate the subject a little further, and to exa-
mine into the cause tint led to its removal and
continuance.
On the 6 h day of March, 1837, General Jesup
entered into a conventional arrangement with the
Seminole Indians, by which it was agreed that hos-
tilities should immediately cease, that the Indians
should emigrate West of the Mississippi, that they
should be secure in their lives and property, and
"that negroes, their bona fide property," should
accompany them. By the terms of this compact
nonet-roes were included, except those who were
called the "bona fide property" of ihe Indians, al-
though Governor Duval, General Jesup, and the
Indian agent, all unite in saying that the Indians
were controlled by the blacks Thete blacks com-
pn ed be th fugitivo slaves and free people of color,
who were connected with the Indians by marriage
and cons n^uimtj The attempt to separate them
appea s to have bppn hopeless
The Irriian nho hid married a fugitive slave
and reared a family of chillren would not, in my
opinion, quietly foid his arms and view his offspring
and their mother marched off into interminable
slavery, v>hile ne himself should go West Noi
do I believe ihat will ever be done They are aH
ihe eremies o' oui conn'ry, fighting in arms
igam t us They have already cost us much trea-
sure, and the b ood of many fr*emen. If tbev
wi'l no  surrtnder themselves ' prisoners of wai,"
í wou'd send them all We t togethei No person
can doubt our peifect right lo do so, and I
think ju tics to tne nation and 'o the Indians rc-
quirtu it, and m*. amendment wnl bp to tliaf et-
fecf G neral J^sup's attempt to sppprate them
fail d, and I beliete all for h"i attempts of that
kind wi't fail
This compact between Gereral Jesnp and the
Indians bears d tie on the 6 h March On the
18th of the same month, a sdemn remonstrance
agairst tl is arranacment wa^-igned by a number
of gen lemen of high st-ndirg in Florida, and
transmuted lo thp Spcietary of War These gen-
tlemen tot->l'y obj'cted to any pacification that d'd
not prov de for the recapture of their fugitive
s'aves I hf< objected to the Indians going West
until they si ould take ard return to their o mers
th* si-ives who h*d escaped from their masters in
Flo ida The rerionstrance may be found at 55th
page of Executive document of the House of Re-
p-esentatives, No 225 of the 3d session of the
25 h Congress.   It is an interesting paper, but of
