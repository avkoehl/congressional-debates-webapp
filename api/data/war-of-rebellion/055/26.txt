WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, November 26, 1863-11.15. a.m.

I congratulate you and your army on the victories of Chattanooga. This is truly a day of thanksgiving.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

Major General U. S. GRANT,

Chattanooga, Tennessee

CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee, November 27, 1863-1 a.m.

(Received 3.10 a.m.)

I am just in from the front. The rout of the enemy is most complete. Abandoned wagons, caissons, and occasional pieces of artillery are everywhere to be found. I think Bragg's loss will fully reach sixty pieces of artillery. A large number of prisoners have fallen into our hands. The pursuit will continue to Red Clay in the morning, for which place I shall start in a few hours.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

RINGGOLD, GA., 2 p.m.,

Via Chattanooga, Tennessee, November 27, 1863-7 p.m

(Received 1.30 a.m., 28th.)

The pursuit has continued to this point with continuous skirmishing. It is asserted by citizens that Longstreet is expected to-morrow, and that the enemy will make a stand at Dalton. I shall not take their word however, but will start Granger this evening to Burnside's relief. I am not prepared to continue pursuit farther.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee, November 28, 1863-9.20 p.m.

(Received 12.35 p.m., 29th.)

The pursuit of the enemy to beyond Ringgold shows their great defeat and demoralization. Prisoners taken must amount to 6,000 or more. Over forty pieces of artillery have fallen into our hands. The roads everywhere are strewn with wagons, caissons, small-arms, and ammunition. Troops are now on their way to the relief of Burnside. Granger goes to Knoxville, or until he knows Longstreet has left East Tennessee. Sherman goes to the Hiwassee, and will be sent farther if it becomes necessary.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
