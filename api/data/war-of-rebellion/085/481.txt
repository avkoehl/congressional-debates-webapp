JEFFERSON BARRACKS, September 29, 1864-3.10 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I left De Soto about 7 a. m. No news of the enemy during the night. I have here two brigades and left one at Meramec bridge. The cavalry will be at the crossing of the Meramec to-night to protect that point. At the present stage of the river cavalry can cross at many points. I will be ready for the field as soon as I can get the brigade from the bridge, but I hope never again to be sent prospecting on the railroad. Can I come to Saint Louis?

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, September 29, 1864-3.30 p. m.
