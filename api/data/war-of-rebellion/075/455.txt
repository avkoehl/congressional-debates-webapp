been to our very camps. Supplies will now be accumulated in Allatoona Pass, or brought right up to our lines. One of my chief objects being to give full employment to Johnston, it makes but little difference where he is, so he is not his way to Virginia.

Major-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Big Shanty, June 11, 1864 - 11 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I send you a report just received from Brigadier-General Garrard.* Have you any instructions for him? If he cannot make headway against Wheeler and drive him and hold both the roads he speaks of, I think he had better move down the Marietta road and hold only the Big Shanty road, so as not to let the enemy get fairly between us and him.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. S. McPHERSON,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

Garrard must hold the old Alabama road and work east toward Bruch Mountain. We will to-morrow be able to send all of Blair's column on the Big Shanty and Roswell Factory road. We must make the enemy spread out as much as possible on this his right flank.

SHERMAN.

[Captain A. C. McCLURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General:]

CAPTAIN: Before the officer sent to General King to direct him to remain in his old position reached him, he had moved. He now connects with the right of Davis. My division now connects with Davis on the left and Baird on the right. The line is now being fortified. Our skirmishers connect and the line is in good condition. Scribner's right rests on the road near Whitfield's.

Respectfully,

R. W. JOHNSON,

Brigadier-General.

Respectfully,

J. M. PALMER,
