OCONEE BRIDGE, November 23, 1864.

Major - General McLAWS:

Road not repaired as the enemy is still on it in my front making for the bridge. I am expecting an attack momentarily. Have not seen General Hardee. His courier followed the enemy and came in last evening, and will try to return this morning. The people in Macon, from my dispatches, know little of what has transpired on the road between that town and this place. Will send you word when the road shall be open for cars.

H. C. WAYNE,

Major - General.

Major - General McLAWS:

Major Hartridge has driven the enemy back across this river, but they have the flat. Austin, with the cadets, has gallantly held the bridge. The enemy are constructing a flat in the woods to try to cross below me tonight. Send me 5,000 54 cartridges.
