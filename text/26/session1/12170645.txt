some of the ailors m thit daik tri6eJy it II re
side.
In the fall of 1S33, when the gentleman from
Massachusetts [Mr. Saltonstall] was a candidate
for the seat he now holds in this Home, "the Es-
sex Ant,slavery convention" propounded to htm a
variety of questions on the subject of slavery.
To these questions Mr Saltonstall,  n the 1st
of November, made a ong reply, the substance of
which is embraced in the lollowmg extract*, v<z:
«Asto the constitutional power of Congress ioabolish slavery
and the sl ve trade in the l)i«tri i of Columbia, I have never
had any t'onot,au ldid mt suppose, «mil recently, thalit could
be mide i r;ti0'*t"n, or thit the exercise ot ihe \ owcr would be
opposeil on that er.uind I ttnrik it rltar, aHo. a^ asentral
principle, that Congress has power lo abulish slavery m the
Territories.                      '          *          *          •          ,
"The questional to the constitutional power of Consress to
aho'ish the slave irade between the States is one of more dif-
ficulty                 ......
"But, not toenlar?e. from whit examination I have given ;he
subiect, my present opinion i^. that t'oi ere s h«a th* power to
prohibit the slave trade between the S.au-s.
"Those powers w.th which t'ie Constitution his invested Con-
giess relate to vastly impenaat subj'Cts. None more fo can
co-rie uider ihe'r ciii«ideiai in. Surely no reason can be found
in tneir ereat importance. v,hy thrv «liould not be e\ rri-ed
However delicate, exciune, cr compl cated, questions in ra-
tion to slavery may 'je. or imv be made, they ought, in my
opinion, to he brought bjiou- Consre^, and to be'tnade the
subject of full, free.~and ('«libera'  di^-us^mn in thit l-j'ila
uve body, wh'ch alone has the poner to rcmedv these evils.
No one who has no iced the-signs ot tha times.'and the progress
of opinion concennns s'aver>,nnt only in the United ¿Talus,
but thronshout the civiiiz d world can doubt hut these subjects
must be brought forward, and thai Consress must, and .nil.
eventually, exercise their coiiMitutiinal power in relauon to
them I do no' now see what n to be sained by dehv, or how
these questions are to becomes! less difhcultor complicate Ibv
postponement On the contrary, wi U my present view-j, I am
of opinion that Conzressousht i >iraeilivelv to exercise its full
cotistiiu lonal powers, by efficient lególa un on the subject ol
slavery.
UJ haoe always considered it a sufficient groundfor a want
of confidence iñ ihe President of Ihe Unit dS'ales, that,m
entering on the duties nf h s office, he mad" ihe gratvilous
declaration, in eff'ct, thai hp should rein any bill which for its
abject the abolition of slaves y in the Dis rid of Columbia—
the most objectionable sentviunl ever avowed by a Chvf Ma-
g'slrale of this nation "
During our 'a>t war with England, the genik-
nan [Mr. S.] was also a prominent member of the
E*cex Convention, ovpr which Timothy Pickering
presided; and from which convention that Federal
junto promulgated so many treasonable threais,
and di^reputatle slanders agunst Jefferson, Madi-
son and their political fr ends.
The memorable document which, that jumo
issued on the 12th oí July, 1812, may sofiUe as a
sample of the rest. Here, sir, is an extract
from it:
"We have (ho confession of Mr  Jefferson, when in an evil
hour he gained the President's chair, that the United States
were in the full tide of successful experiment    And what has
ehinged the scene?   What ha-s produced years of sufferms, and
at'engthwar?   The total departure from those principles of
ad ainis'.ering our Government which had brought in a lull tide
of prosperity."
**             «             .             .             *             .             .
"Our country is greviously oppressed by prohibition* of
trade, wantonly imposed by the Government of the United
Uiater, and its measure of iniquity is now filled -up, by a de-
claration of war, impolitic, unnecessary and unjust.
"We will not submit. Men deaf to the voice of reason and
justice must be deprived of power.
"We delare that our rulers, (James Madison and the Repub-
lican admimstrati m of that time) have forfeited all pub'ic con-
fidence, and that our dearest interests require every possible
effurt to reduce them topnva'e life.
"Those representatives who suppor'ed and voted for those
pernicious measures, and finally for the desperate avd
atrocious act of declaring war, have shown themselves tobe
enemies of the Commonwealth.
"Our common interest, liberty And safety are now more in
jured by the doings of our National <?overnment, than they
were, Who, in 1775, took up arms to defend them against the
measures of the Government of Great Britain."
By order of the Convention.
"TIMOTHY PICKERING, President.
Here, then, sir, is a great cen'ral committee
which the Federal party have organized at the seat
of Government, some cf who<e members stand
pledged to abol sh s'avery tn every form, and
whenever they can; and to ripen and to consum-
mate that va<-t and h/rrid scheme of political cm-
bftion, wh'ch the Federalists oí ihe South and Abo-
litionists of the North have conjointly planned to
sever the Union, and to coyer the land with murder,
rebellion, and bl^od. And, as if to tnsuJt the pride, to
awaken the apprehen3iqn,# d lo kindle the indigna-
tion of every Southern pa}{ jot, a Hartford Con-
fiWioo politician is selected to couneel and to
gu tk!—a peace-loving hrro, who, in the hour of
uatt'e, stood upon the orfines of treason to his
•."um'.ry's cause, and had enly to make another
s ep to reach the felon's gallows, or the headman's
ate!
Yet, sir, this public spirited patriot—this heroic
chrmpion of liberty and law—now modestly in-
v-i kes a restoration of this Government to the days
of our patriot Presidents!
Surely, sir, Demociais who desire the mainte-
nance of Southern rights may well distrust the po-
licy of any restoration which such a sdf created
Executive Committee is calculated to produce; and
very safely ascribe the pretended fear of a stand-
ing aimy, the affected, new born zeal for public
economy and the general weal, and all the va-
rious political scarecrows of the day, to the same
Federal aristocracy winch has always labored un-
der a political disability to be pleased with any
thing that a Democratic Administration could ef-
fect; and which has steadily endeavored to depre-
ciate the honor, prosperity, and institutions of this
country, whenev?r Federalism ceased to rule it
legitimately by the grace of God.
Tnis financial document, artfully prepared by
a self-created Executive Committee, purports to
prove by an unexplained statement taken from the
Treasury Department, in 1838, that the expendi-
tures of the United S(ates amounted, in 1837, to
$39,164,745; and, on the credit of the unexplained
sta'en en', the credulous and uninformed multi-
tude are invited to be.ieve that the current ordinary
expenses of the Government have reached th¡3
magnitude under the auspicrs of our present De-
mocratic Administration.
The very same Treasury Department, from
whence the Executive Crmmittpe obtained their
unexplained statement, fully and precs"ly shows
each s^pa'ate lt^m of the public expenditures
Yet this lair, impartial, pa'riotic, self-created exe-
cutive crmmitiee produced nothing, and stated no-
thirg, which indicates how, or for what purpose,
any one it m of those public expenditures arcrued.
No; that wou'd have debited the purpose for which
the prpcious document was ccncoc(ed, and wou'd
have convinced the public mind that the practice
and professions of the present Administration have
fairly conformed to the public expectation and de-
s're.
But, sir, delusion must take her dusky fight, and
public justice must be amply vincicated. The
whole and wholesome truth i? what the people anx-
ious'y des;re, and are entitled to receive. And it
shall go freely forth to the world, that every honest
and ra'ional man may comprehend and acknow-
ledge the wrongs—the flagrant, wilful wrongs—that
have been offered to this wise, upright, and econo-
mical Administration.
Here, sir, is a tabular statement, showing, in
three separate colu mns, the public «xpenditures i rom
1824 to 1839, inclusive:

The first of these tabular statements exhibits the
aggregate expenditures; and the second one the de-
tailed, separate expenditures for extraordinary and
temporary purposes, including the public debt.
The second table explains the third column in
the first one; and the two tables will enable every
citizen to understand the true amount and charac-
ter of our public expenditures. They clearly show
that the public expenditures for permanent and or-
dinary purposes have never amounted to $14,000,-
000, during any one year of the present Adminis-
tration.
The table commences with the last year of Mr.
Monroe's administration, and come* down through,
the single term of Mr. Adams, the two terms of
General Jackson, and the three years of Mr. Van
Baren; and applies the same impartial rule to them
alL It first gives the aggregate, and then separates
the extraordinary from the ordinary expense; and
by a simple exhibition, of figures, clearly shows
that ihe aggregate expense of Mr. Monroe's ad-
ministration was not, as has been too often asserted,
asserted, only $13,000,000, but about the danbl^oi,
that; while the frugality claimed for any preceding
administration at the expense of Mr. Van Buren's,
is deceptious aisd unreal, and is only apparent,even
in a fallacious form, when resort is had to the
very process which reduces the expense of Mr.
Van Buren's administration below the sum of
#14,000,000; that is, by a deduction of the extraor-
dinary.
Now, Mr. Chairman, I have met with no gentle-
man of enlarged views and knowledge of ibis great
country, who would venture to assert that
$14,000,000 as wa prodigal allowance for the cur-
rent expenses of a nation so extensive m territory 
so expansive in action, and SQ progressive m
wealth, power, and resources, as the Republic of
the Un.ted States. Every gentleman, I think, con- -
cedes the propriety of such an allowance for the
maintenance of a Government so mighty as this.
But ihe Opposition party endeavor to fasten on the
Administration the exclusive re.<ponS1bility and the
public odium of e«ry expenditure beyond  >«
sum: «ad unfairly argue that the President is bound,
