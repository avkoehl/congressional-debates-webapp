enemy ceased all heavy efforts against our position. I twice stepped to the front of the works on the Columbia pike to see the effect of such fighting. I never saw the dead lay near so thick. I saw them upon each other, dead and ghastly in the powder-dimmed star-light. My withdrawal was under General Cox's instructions and was accomplished at midnight. My pickets, under Major Holden, of the Eighty-eighth Illinois, remained an hour later, when he brought them off without annoyance.

The brigade lost an aggregate of 216. Its trophies were 9 battle-flags, 394 prisoners, 19 of whom were officers, retaking a battery and a section of another one, and recapturing the colors of a regiment of another brigade. Many other battle-flags were left by the enemy when our charge put the enemy to flight, but which the men would not stop to pick up till after the battle; in the meantime other troops came up and secured them.

My losses were light, but five regimental commanders were either killed or disabled. Among the former I deplore the death of Lieutenant-Colonel Olson, of the Thirty-sixth Illinois Veteran Volunteers. He was a true, noble man, and high type of an officer.

The officers and men all did magnificently, but Lieutenant-Colonel Smith was conspicuous even among heroes, and his command captured five battle-flags. Captain Bates, commanding One hundred and twenty-fifth Ohio, was almost beyond reach of praise. He did every-thing that he ought, and so did each and all. The nation will do them justice; I cannot.

Captain R. C. Powers, acting assistant adjutant-general, was of eminent service. His high judgment and courage were of great assistance in the achievements of this momentous day. I respectfully ask your attention to notices of individual gallantry in the subordinate reports.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EMERSON OPDYCKE,

Colonel, Commanding.
