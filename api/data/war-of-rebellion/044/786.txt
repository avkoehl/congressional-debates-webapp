JUNE 8, 1863. - Scout from Suffolk, Va, to South Mills, N. C

Report of Major General John J. Peck, U. S. Army.

SUFFOLK, June 8, 1863.

SIR: It gives me pleasure to advise you that Major [James N.] Wheelan made a movement before daylight upon a guerrilla party near South Mills. He captured 2 large Confederate flags, 97 cartridge-boxed, 13 belts, 1 limber chest, and lesser articles. One prisoner taken. The party would have been secured had not his approach been signaled by a woman. He has just taken command, and deserves credit for his energetic conduct.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

Major-General DIX.

JUNE 10, 1863. - Capture of the steamer Maple Leaf, off Cape Henry, Va.

Report of Major General John A. Dix, U. S. Army.

FORT MONROE, VA., June 11, 1863 - 4 p. m.

SIR: I have just returned from Williamsburg, where I went at 10 o'clock yesterday morning. At 1. 30 the Maple Leaf left for Fort Delaware, with 97 rebel officers. They rose on the guard, overpowered it, took possession of the steamer, and landed below Cape Henry. Thirty of the officers refused to participate in the transaction, remained on board, and are here. Our cavalry is in pursuit of the others. The officer in charge of the guard was grossly negligent, and should be dismissed the service. Lieutenant-Colonel [B. C.] Ludlow will make a detailed report, which I will forward to-morrow.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
