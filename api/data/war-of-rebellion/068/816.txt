HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 16, 1864-11 a. m. (Received 12 m.)

Major-General WARREN:

GENERAL: You will please push out your skirmishers and pickets, properly supported, to feel the enemy and ascertain whether there is any change in his position. It is not designed by this movement to bring on a general engagement with the enemy in his works.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

(Same to General Wright.)
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 16, 1864-12.30 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

Dispatch to push out my skirmishers just received. They are already out to the edge of the open field, and cannot well be advanced farther. There seems to be no change in the enemy's position. I sent Major Roebling with a sketch to explain everything to you before your dispatch came.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

In reply to this General Warren was ordered to push out and report developments.

GEO. G. MEADE.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 16, 1864-12.35 [p. m.].

Major-General MEADE:

As any further advance will most probably bring on a shelling from the enemy's batteries, I require a little delay to get out my wagons, which ar issuing supplies to the troops, having but a short time ago arrived. If I may refer to it, Colonel Comstock was just here and thought we had already developed the condition of affairs in our front. I shall make immediate preparation to advance my skirmish line as ordered.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

[First indorsement.]

As Lieutenant-Colonel Comstock is of the opinion an advance on General Warren's front is unnecessary, the question is referred to the lieutenant-general commanding. His orders now are to advance.

GEO. G. MEADE.

[Second indorsement.]

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

All I wanted was to be assured that the enemy retained their old position, or, if they had taken up a new one, to find where it was.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
