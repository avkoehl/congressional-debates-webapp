NATIONAL CEMETERIES
Mr. WILSON. I move now to take up
Senate bill No. 446.
The motion was agreed to ; and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
consider the bill (S. No. 446) to amend an
act entitled " An act to establish and to pro-
tect national cemeteries," approved February

to select the superintendents of the national
cemeteries from meritorious and trustworthy
soldiers, either commissioned officers or en-
listed men of the volunteer or regular Army,
who may have been disabled for active field
service in the line of duty. The superintend-
ents are to receive for their compensation from

ively assigned, to be determined by the Sec-
retary of War; and they are also to be fur-
nished with quarters and fuel, as now provided

FORT COLMNS ItKSISRVATIOM.
â–  Mr. WILSON. I move to take up House
bill No. 177U declaring the lands constituting
the Fort Collins military reservation, in the
Territory of Colorado, subject to preemption
and homestead entry as provided lor in exist-
ing laws.
The motion was agreed to ; and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
consider the bill, wluoh declares that the lands
constituting the Fort Collins military reserva-
tion, m the Territory of Colorado, so far as
the same have not been lawfully disposed of
since their reservation, are hereby restored to
the United States and made subject to pre-
emption and homestead entry, as now provided
for by law.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment.
Mr. P0MBI10Y. I inquire whether those
lands are not valuable lands, and whether, by
restoring them-to the public laud system, they
may not go directly to some grant which has
been made which covers that section of coun-
try? I do not know the fact, but I have lound
out that out of all our grants we except mili-
tary reservations and Indian reservations, but
the moment you restore those reservations to
the public lands, the grants take effect; the
lands do not go to settlers, but, go to the rail-
roads they are granted to. I do not Know
whether this is one of those cases or not; but
it is liable to be.
Mr. WILSON. The bill provides that those
lands which have not been lawfully disposed
of since they were reserved are hereby restored
to the public lands.
_ Mr. POMEROY. They could not be law-
fully disposed of while they were in a reserva-
tion. Now, you extinguish the reservation,
and then they will be disposed of under the
existing laws, and if there is a law granting
them to some railroad company, the railroad
will get them in preference to the settler.
Mr. WILSON. They are only subject to
preemption and homestead entry by the bill.
Mr. POMEROY. If you put in the word
"only" after "homestead entry," so as to
read "subject to preemption and homestead
entry only."
Mr. WILSON. I do not object to that
amendment.
The amendment was agreed to.
The amendment was ordered to be engrossed
and the bill to be read a third time. The bill
was read the third time, and passed.
DANIEL ORNER.
Mr. WILSON. I move to take up next
House bill No. 1238.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
consider the bill (H. R. No. 1238) to remove
the charge of desertion against Daniel Orner,
late private in company H, ninety-first regi-
ment Pennsylvania volunteers. The pream-
ble recites that Daniel Orner, late a private in
company H, ninety-first regiment of Pennsyl-
vania volunteers, stands charged on the records
of the Adjutant General's office with desertion ;
that he was on duty with his regiment until
after the surrender of Lee, in April, 1865, and
left his regiment because of severe illness, and
because he shared in the general belief that
the war had ihen closed, and was absent from
his regiment but eight, hours, and afterward
died from the effecis of the disease contracted
in the line of his duty. The bill therefore
authorizes and directs the Adjutant General to
remove the charge of desertion against Daniel
Orner, late private in company H, ninety-first
regiment of Pennsylvania volunteers.
The bill was reported to the-Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read
the third time, and passed.

Mr. WILSON. I move next to take up
House bill No. 1670.
The motion was agreed to; .and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
consider the bill (H. R. No. 1670) for the
relief of Isaac B. Kinkead. It directs the
Paymaster General of the Army to pay to Isaac
B. Kinkead, late a captain in the seventy-
soventh regiment Ohio volunteers, out of any
money appropriated for the pay of the Army,
the full pay and allowances of a captain of
infantry, fiom the 31st day of October, 1862,
to the 18th day of April, 1863.
The bill was reported to the Senate-without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read
the third time, and passed.

JOIIN O. SMITH.
Mr. WILSON. I move to take up House
bill No. 1303.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
consider the bill (H. R. No. 1303; to amend
the first section of an act entitled " An act to
provide for the disposition of useless military
reservations," approved February 24, 1871.
It proposes to amend the first section of the
act of February 24, 1871, by adding thereto
the following proviso:
And provided further, That upon payment of the
appraised value by John C. Smith, or his heirs, a
patent shall be issued to said Smith, or his heirs, lor
so much of the military hay reserve of Fort Walla-
Wiilla, Washington Territory, as is embraced in the
north halt of section twenty-sis. township No. 8
north, of range No. 35 east of the Willamette meri-
dian, so soon after such payment as the said Smith
shall prove to the satisfaction of the register and the
receiver of the proper land office that he w.is m the
lawful possession of said land under the preemption
laws of the United States at the time said land was
taken by the military authorities for a hay reserve
as aforesaid.
Mr. POMEROY. I apprehend there can
be but one objection to that bill. That
gives him a half section-instead of a quarter
section. We generally give preemptors a
quarter section. This bill gives a half section.
I have no objection to it, however.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read
the third time, and passed.
