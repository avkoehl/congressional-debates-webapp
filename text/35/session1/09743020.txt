Thus it appears that the receipts for the first
quarter of the fiscal year were $20,928,819 81,
while in the second quarter of the same year they
were only $7,092,665—a falling off from twenty
millions to seven millions in one quarter of the
,6ame fiscal year.
I have also prepared a statement showing the
amount of imports and exports for the first three
quarters of the same fiscal year. It is as follows:

I have also prepared another table showing the
estimated receipts and expenditures from the 1st
of July, 1858, to the 31st of December, 1858, and
also one for the four quarters of the fiscal year
ending the 31st of June, 1858. It is understood
that the loan asked for now, together with the
estimated receipts, is to cover the expenses of the
first two quarters of the next fiscal year, com-
mencing July 1. In consequence of the unsettled
state of trade, we have no reliable basis upon
which to make the estimate; but we can approx-
imate to the sum. By the 1st of January next
we will have light enough to know just how we
stand; and then will be the time to laise our tariff,
and everything conncctcd with it, according to
the exigencies of the times and the indications of
the future.
The appropriations made at the present session
of Congress will amount to probably $68,000,000.
Of this, however, but $58,000,000 will be required
for the fiscal year 1859, the residue being incident
to the fiscal year 1858.
This nine millions and upwards for deficiency
of 1858, is no pan of the ordinary expenses of
the Government. We can come back in time to
the ordmarystandard without anygreat difficulty,
by retrenchment and reform. That retrenchment
and reform only begun at this session of Congress
cannot be effective. It must be determined on
at the next session of Congress by legislation.
There is no man in the country so wanting in in-
telligence as not to know that under the system
of enormous land grants for railroad purposes,
and under the system of squandering the public j
money m building custom-hfruse monuments all j
over the country, inaugurated under a plethoric
Treasury, we can never reduce the expenditures .
of the Government. "We have now gone on from
something like fifty million dollars a year, to an
expenditure of seventy or eighty million dollars,
over two thirds of which is legitimately expended
for the purpose simply of conducting the Govern-
ment. I believe it is in the power of the Dem-
ocratic party—and it will be responsible for it—to
bring us back to a proper condition of economical
expenditure; but to enable us to do this we must
first pay off the legacy entailed upon us of old
debts incurred by this system of unwise legisla-
tion, and begin our reform by discontinuing the
practice. Qur foreign relations now require an
expansion in only one direction—the increase of
our Navy. That is a legitimate exercise of the
powers of Government, and necessary to main-
tain our proper position in the family of nations.
When the Government has ceased to build cus-
tom-houses and to multiply them all over the land,
and ceased also to convert every depot in the coun-
try into ports of delivery; when the Capitol ex-
tension is completed, which may be in a year, and
the other Public Buildings, Patent Office, Post
Office extension, Treasury, the aqueduct, and
when all these incidentake&penses are got rid of,
it will be within the power of the Democratic
party, under the counsels of our present Presi-
dent, to bring down the expenses of the Govern-
ment to $55,000,000 a year. I hope to sec this
realized in 1860. I am in favor of this reduction.
It is utterly impossible for any party to bring about
this reform at once. The great point to be aimed
at is not to exhibit a parsimonious economy in
repudiating our past debts, no matter how reck-
lessly contracted, nor in changing laws in appro-
priation bills; it must be done deliberately and
systematically. It is not to be done by beginning
at the heel of the session to exhibit a spirit of
wonderful reform in scaling the public debt; but we
must begin at the beginning. Let the Democratic
party, which certainly holds power in this House
one session more, (and if it will not go for reform,
it does not deserve to be in power any longer,
and holds the Executive and Senate for several
years to come,) commence at the beginning of
the session, and we will cure this evil. It will
not do to exhibit a wonderful display of economy
just one or two days before the adjournment of
the session in filibustering on appropriation bills.
I have to say, with all duu deference to my friends
on both sides of the House, that the country un-
derstands exactly what that is worth. Much
capital is not made by it by any parties.
Mr. LOVEJOY. Will the gentleman from
Pennsylvania let me say a word here*
Mr. J. GLANCY JONES. I cannot yield
now, as my time is short.
Mr. LOViiJOV. Then I hope the gentleman
does nor charge us with filibustering.
Mr. J. GLANCY JONES. I have seen a good
deal of it on both sides of the House, and not a
little this morning in the war speech of my friend
from Massachusetts, [Mr. Burlingame.]
Mr. LOVETOY. You have not seen itonthis
side of the House on any single appropriation
bill.
Mr. J. GLAiNCY JONES. I have heard,with-
in the last half hour, a most tremendous demon-
stration of what I call filibustering—a war speech
on the loan bill, while I know that the gentleman
who made it will not go for paying expenses.
Theie is not a constituency of five men on that
side of the House who would support a war
measure before the country, or vote money to
pay for it, if I were to bring in a bill to-morrow
asking for the money, and men to use it. I do
not blame them font. Experience has taught us
that the best way to get along is to insist upon our
rights at ail hazards, and to ask for nothing but
what is right. A war speech in time of peace is
very safe, and naturally, like froth, works itself
off. I will hold myself ready to vote for war, and
to vote for supplies to maintain it, whenever I
think the honor of the country is assailed or
touched.
Mr. KUNKEL, ofPennsyl vania. So will wo.
Mr. J. GLANCY JONES. I3ut you would not
now be found voting to give the President of the
United States authority to redress instantly the
first insult offered to our flag on every sea. I am
ready to give the President money and men to do
both, but I know such a position could not be
carried in this House, and hence I refrain from
making war speeches, only to end in words, and
find fault with such of my friends on the other
side of the House who indulge in this harmless
amusement for Buncombe. I could not let the
opportunity pass without this remark, that it is
rather inconsistent in a gentleman to rise here in
this body—and the country will fully appreciate
it-—and assail the Executive of the United States,
no matter to what party he may belong, for not
prosecuting a war, when that gentleman, by virtue
of his being a member of Congress, is expected
to know that, under the jealous reserve of the
Constitution of the United States, the Executive
has not the power to lift one finger in hostility
without the action of Congress; and stil worse
is it when that gentleman would not vote to give
him thatpow^ to-day. If the gentleman means
what he says, why does he not vote to give the
Executive power? The idea of finding fault with
the Executive for not waging war, resenting in-
sults, &c., when he has neither power or money
given him by Congress to do either, is a species
of demonstration which I should be sorry to see
often exhibited here by friend or foe, and must
certainly (I say it with all duo personal regard
for my friend) bring Congress into ultimate con-
tempt at home and abroad, wherever it is under-
stood.
I now send to the Clerk's desk the referred to
tabular statcmen t of the estimated receipts and ex-
penditures for the next two quarters—that is, from
now until the 1st of January next; and also for
the four quarters of the current fiscal year—actual

1 _ Thus it appears that if the loan of $15,000,000
is grunted, and you do not increase the expenses
by legislation at th's session, either in appropri-
ation bills or by the passage of private bills re-
quiring money, there will be a little over two mi-
lion dollars in the Treasury on the 1st of January
next. Experience has taught us, however, espe-
cially under our present Mint system, that we
ought at all times to have a balance of #5,000,000
on hand in the Treasury in order to work the ma-
chinery of the Treasury Department. We shall,
therefore, be short $3,000,000 of a good working
balance; but it will be safe for months to rest it.
I propose that the House pass this bill in its pres-
ent shape, providing for a not exceeding six per
