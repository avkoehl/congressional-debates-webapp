Ohio, for his gallantry in turning upon the enemy the first gun on the ridge, which he discharged by firing his musket over the went. The same man alone ordered and received the surrender of 20 men with the colors of the Twenty-eighth Alabama on the 23rd instant.

Sergt. D. L. Sutphin, Company D, Ninety-third Ohio, and reaching the crest, captured a stand of colors in the hands of its bearer.

Corporal Angelbeck, Company I, Forty-first Ohio, seeing a caisson filled with ammunition already on fire with 2 wounded horses attached to it, cut them loose and ran the burning carriage down the hill before it exploded.

The colors of the First Ohio Infantry, the first on the hill, were carried at different times by the following persons: Corpl. John Emery, Company I, wounded; Corpl. William W. McLaughlin, Company I, killed; Captain Nicholas Trapp, wounded; Corpl. Frederick Zimmerman, and Major Stafford.

The foregoing are but a few of the many instances of heroism displayed of this occasion.

Maj. William Birch, Ninety-third Ohio, and Maj. S. C. Erwin, Sixth Ohio Infantry, who fell while leading their men, were soldiers of rare efficiency, and their loss will be severely left by the service and lamented by their friends.

My entire staff, as has always been the case in the numerous battles in which they have been engaged, conducted themselves with the greatest bravery and usefulness. In summing up the operations of the 23rd and 25th, I have to report the capture of 382 prisoners, beside a large number of wounded, of 2 stand of colors, of 18 pieces of artillery, with their appendages, 650 stand of small-arms a considerable quantity of clothing, camp and garrison equipage, and several loaded wagons.
