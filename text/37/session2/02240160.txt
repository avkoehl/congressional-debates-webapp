GUNBOATS I1'Oil THE WESTERN RIVERS.
Mr. FESSENDEN. The Committee on Fi-
nance, to whom was referred the bill (H. R. No.
155) making an appropriation for gun boats on the
western rivers, have instructed me to report it
back without amendment, and with a recommend-
ation that if be passed at once. It is important,
especially in view of the fact that we may adjourn
for some days, that it be acted on at once
Mr. KING and Mr. TRUMBULL. What is it?
Mr. FESSENDEN. Let the letter from Gen-
eral Meigs accompanying it be read.
The bill was considered as in Committee of the
Whole. It appropriates $1,000,000 for gunboats
on the western rivers.
The Secretary read the following letter:
Quartermaster General's Office,
W'ajshimiron City, December r>} lÂ£6l.
Sir: 1 respectfully call j our aitcntiun to tin; propriety of
eaily piovi->ibn to meet the expense of eons-trueting the
armed flotilla on the western livers.
Undei the appropilationf, amounting to $1,300,000, for
yunboat^ on ti)'j \\c>torn uver&, made by Congre^ at its
Kist -p-moi), f was dnected to coutiact lor ?even gunboats.
The plans of the>e vessels had been prepaied bv a naval
con.-'t.uelor, .-[leciully a>sjgn^d to that duty by the Navy
Depaihnent. Ptopo.-als wete invited by advertisement, and
it wn-s concluded that the building, equipment, and maiu-
tenain-'' of Miven or' these boats, with pauncnt for three
uih<-i gunboats, then in beiviee3 would exhaust the anmo-
pnntjon. li
The general commanding the department of the \Ve>t
oidered, ot St. Loui-. the construe..on ot a fleet ot mostar-
boats. and ot bcvetal fu^-boats. to be used with them, and 11
the put chase and alteiauou into gunboats of two river ji
steameM. rhe " New Faa" and tike{i Submarine." All these ii
were ordered by him in addition to those provided lor by
the quartermaster's department.
Under his order?, some money remitted to the quarter
master at St. Louis for othei puiposes has been paid upon
the contracts for this flotilla.
The officeis of thequarterma&ter'sdepartmentwhohavc
expended this money weie bound by the oiders of the gen-
eral commanding in the department, and should be protected
from pecuniary liability incurred in the execution of those
orders.
While I am not called upon to express an opinion as to
the necessity for the construction of so lar^e a flotilla, I
have no doubt that the Governmerit'is bound to pay the con-
tractor's their reasonable expenditures; audi have no doubt
that if armed and equipped and well manned, the vessels
will add to the strength of the Army in the West, and con-
duce to the success of the expedition intended to open the
Mississippi.
In the annual estimate from this office 1s! an item of
$1,000,000 for gunboats on the western riveis. its earlv
appropiiation would enable the department to complete and
pay foi the boats undT construction, some of which aic in
danger of being delayed at St. Louis until the interruption
of navigation by ice.
It would lehevc those who, in good faith, expended their
labor and money upon these boats from heavy pecuniaiy
liabilities.
I am, tespoctfully, your obedient servant,
M. C. MEIGS, Quartermaster General.
Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War.
Mr. GRIMES. I desire to ask the chaiiman
of the Committee on Finance if the money appro-
priated by this bill is intended to covcrthe mortar-
boats?, the rafts, and the whole flotilla that has
been in process of preparation at Cairo, St. Louis,
and other points, or only to apply to those called
by General Meigs in his letter " gunboats" prop-
er? I suppose the purpose is to cover them all,
so that this money shall be appropriated for the
payment of workmen and contractors who have
been in the employment of the Government on
all these different water crafts ulike. If so, it is
right.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I can only say that the
bill follows precisely the language of the esti-
mates. The Department asked for an additional
million for the building of gunboats. The bill has
been drawn in the House of Representatives in
the language of the estimates as sent from the De-
partment. The letter which has been read from
General Meigs explains the whole thing. I see
no difficulty about it. The gunboats have been
built; but he states that a portion of the money
that was appropriated for the purpose of building
gunboats has been, under the direction of the
commanding general, applied to the purchase and
fitting up of some river steamboats as gunboats,
and also for mortar-boats. Mortar-boats carry
guns. This bill does not describe the particular
article; but I suppose the language would apply
as well to those as any others. There is no danger
of any mistake on the subject. The money will
unquestionably be applied to these boats, it is
so intended, and 1 sec no difficulty, under the lan-
guage of the bill, m applying it precisely as the
Senator desires; and I know that to be the inten-
tion, because it has been so explained. I should
think it hardly worth while to amend the bill and
send it back to the House of Representatives, be-
cause there may be some little difficulty befoic we
adjourn in getting it completed, and it is neces-
sary that it should be passed at once. If we find
that there is any difficulty about it, we can amend
it afterwards.
Mr. GRIMES. With the explanation of the
Senator that this appropriation is intended to
cover the amounts that have been expended on
any and all classes of boats composing this flo-
tilla, I am perfectly satisfied with the passage of
the bill.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read the
third time, and passed.
HOUSES LOST AT LEXINGTON.
Mr. BROWNING. I present a resolution,
which J desire to have consideied now;
Resolved, That the Committee on Mihtaiv AtF.il* s and the
.Militia be directed to inquire into the piopnetv ot making
compensation tor hoi<es lost bytho&e m the cavalry service
at Lt-AingUHij jYItf.-omi, and to repoit by bill or ot'lienvise.
The resolution was considered by unanimous
consent.
Mr. BROWNING. I believe that all or nearly
all of the Illinois cavalry who were at Lexington
had supplied then- own horsed. There they'lost
them. I have had quite a number of letters from
persons who were connected with that seivice,
calling attention to this subject, and it is worthy
of consideration. They are certainly entitled to
