for its creation originated m the Senate, the debates
m which were at that time not public. We have,
however, the debates in the House, we have Ihe
reports of the Secretaries, and we have the law
itself Let us endeavor to learn, from these sources,
for what objects this institution was created, and
whether a national currency was one of those objects
Certainly, sir, it must be admitted that cunency
was not the only object ¡a incorporating the bank
of 1791 The Government was new, its fiscal af-
fairs were not well arranged, it was greatly in debt,
and the political state of things at the time render-
ed it highly probable that sudden occasions foi
making loans would srise That it might assist
the operations of the Treasury, therefore, and that
it might make those loans to Government, if press-
ing occasions should arise, were two of the pur-
poses had in view in establishing the bank But
it i? equally clear that there was a third purpose,
and that respected commerce and currency To
Jarmsha cunency foi general circulation, and to aid
exchange, was, demonstrably, a clear, distinct, and
avmoed object, in the creation of the first bank
On the 13th of December, 1700, the Secietary of
the Treasury made a report to the House of Repre-
sentatives, recommending a national bank In this
report, he set forth the advantages of fcuch an in-
stitution , one of these advantages, he saj s, consists
"in increasing the quantity of circulating; medium,
and quickening the circulation " And he then
proceeds to observe "This last may íequire some
illustration When payments are to be made be-
tween different places, having an i tercourse of
business with each other, if there happen to be no
private bills at market, and there are no bank notes
which have a currency in both, the consequence is,
that com must be remitted This is attended with
trouble, delay, expense, and risk If, on the con-
trary, there are bank notes current in both places,
the transmission of these, by ths post, or any other
speedy or convementconvevance, answers the pur-
pose, and the e again, in the alternations of de-
mand, are frequently returned, very soon after to
the place whence Ihey were first sent whence the
ti asportation and retransportton of the meláis are
obviated, and a more convenient and a more ex-
peditious medium of payment is substituted "
Is not this clear proof, that one object m estab-
lishing the bank, in the opinion of the Secretan,
was the creation of a cunei cy which should have
general credit throughout the country, and, ty
means of such credit, should become a convenient
and expeditious medium of exchange' Cuirencj,
sir, currency and exchange were then, bevond all
doubt, important objects, m the opinion of the pro-
poser of the measure, to be accomplished by ihe
institution The debates «huh took place in the
House of Repiesentatives confirm the same idea
Mr Madison, who objected to the bill on constitu-
tional grounds, admitted, nevertheless, that one of
the advantages of a bank con^ts " in facilitating
occasional remittance*, from different places «here
notes happen to circulate," and Mr Ames, who
was on  of the most distinguished friends of the
measure, and who represented a commercial dis-
trict, enlarged on the great benelt of the proposed
institution to c mmerce He insisted that the in-
tercourse between the States could never be en a
good footing, without an institution whose paper
would circulate more extensively thin that of any
State bank, and what he sa«, m the future, we
have seen in the past, and feel in the present
Other gentlemen, a so, contended that some such
institution was necessary, in order to enable Con-
gress to regulate the commeice of the country, and,
for that reason, that it would be constitutional, as
being proper means for a lawful end
When the bill had passed the two Houses, the
President, as we all know, asked the opinion of hi«
Cabinet upon its constitutionality. The Secretary
of Stale and the Attorney General were against it,
the Secretary of the Treasury was in favor of it,
and among the grounds on which he placed the
right of Congress to tiass ihe law, was its adapta-
tion to the exercise of the commercial power, con-
ferred by the Constitution on Congress His lan-
guage is " The institution of a bank has, also, a
natural relation to the regulation of trade between
the Stales, in so  far as it is conducive to the
creation of a convenient medium of exchange
between them, and to the keeping up a full circula-
tion, by preventing the frequent displacement of the
metals in reciprc cal remittances Money is the
very hinge on which commerce turns, and this
does not mean merely gold and silver , many other
things have sened the purpose, with different
degrees of utility Paper has been extensively
employed It can not, therefore, be admitted, with
the Attorney General, that the regulation of trade
between the States, as it concerns the medium of
circulation and exchange, ought to be considered
as confined lo com " " \nd it is," he adds, " m
reference to these general relations of commerce,
that an establishment which furnishes facilities to
circulation, ind a convenient medium of exchange
and alienation, is to be regarded as a regulation of
trade "
Nothing can be plainer, sir, than this language ,
and therefore, nothing is more certain thin that
Iho'e w ho recommended and supported ihe first
bank, regarded it as a fit and necessary measure,
m order to enable Congress to exercise" lis important
duty of legulatmg commerce, pad to fulfil, espe-
cially, that part of the duty « hich enjoined upon it
the provision of a proper and suitable currency for
cuculation and exchinge
But it is not necessaiy to lely on these opinions
of individual friends of the measure Let the act
speak foi itself Let u« look into it, and search us
reasons on its face Whit are the grounds
and objects oí the lw, as set fonh in the law itself
The preamble tells us     It declares
"That the establishing of a bank will be very
conducive to the successful conducting of t e
national finances, and will tend to give facility to
the obtaining of loans for the use of Government in
sudden emeigencies, and will be ptoductive of con-
siderable advantage to tráete, and industry in general "
Trade and industry in general, therefore con-
stituted one distinct and definite object of the mcor
poration, if the law truly expounds its own pur-
poses It was not revenue alone , it was not the
facility of making loans merely it was not mere
utility to Government, but, in addition to these, it
was commerce, it was the interest of the people, it
was trade and business in general, which, among
other considerations, formed an important part of
the objects of the incorporation, and mdeei, sir,
even's pioved that it was va.tly the most important
part of all What else did the first bank do, for
the Government or the country, at all to be com-
pared, in the amount of benefit, to its influence on
the cunency and the exchanges'
It is as clear as demonstrat on, fheiefore, that the
Government, in General Washington's timp, did
feel itself authored by the Constitution, and bound
in dutv, to provide a safe currency of genera]
ere lit for circulation and fcr exchange It dil pio-
vide sin h a currency It is remarkable encusjli so
comparatively small was the mere object of keep
mg the public money, that no provision for that
purpose was inserted in the char'er, nor was there
any law on the subject, so far as I remembci, till
the year 1800
The bank went  into  opeiation, and its siiocp's
«as   great  and instantaneous,   and during   the
whole period of its existence, «heie was no com
plaint of the slate  of   the currency or the   ex-
changes
And now, sir, let me ask, what was it ih-it g">ve
this success to the new mst tution 1 lis capital
was small and Government had nopirlieipai omit
its direction , it w as crmmitted pntirely to mdn idual
man gement and control
Tts notes, it is true, were made receivalle in pav
ments to Government that wis one advantage
It had a solid capital, and its piper was at all
times convertible into gold and s lvei at the will
and pleasure of the holder that was another and
a mrst important ground of its prosperity But,
sir, there wis something more thin all thi* There
was something which touched men's sentiment-, as
well as their understandings There wa« a cause
which earned the credit of the new-born bank, as
on the wings of the wind, to every quarter and
every extremi'y of the country There was a
charm, which created trust, and faith, and reliance,
not only m the great marts of commerce, but m
every corner into which money, in any form, could
penetrate That cause was its nationality of cha-
racter It had the broad seal of the Union to its
charter. It was the institution of the nation, esta-
blished by that new Government which the people
already loved, and it was known to be designed to
revive and foster that commerce which had so long
been prostrate and lifeless.
Mr President, let it be borne in mind that I am
not now arguing the constitutionality, or present
expediency, of a Bank of the United States My
sentiments are already well known on that suh
ject, and, if they were not, the subject is not now
before us
But I hate adverted to the histoiy of the first
bank, and examined the grounds on a hich, and the
purposes for wh ch, it was established, in order lo
show the fact, that this Government, from the first,
has acknowledged the important duty and obliga-
tion of providing for currency and exchange, as
part of the necessary regulation of commerce I
do not mean, at present, to say that a bank is the
only, or the indispensable, means by which this
duty can and must be pet formed, although I cer-
tainly think it the bes.t Yet I will not set limits to
the wisdom and sagacity of gentlemen, in the in-
vention and adaptation of means if they do net
like a bank, let them try whatever they do like
If they know a betlei instrument oi agent, let them
use it Bui I maintain that the performance of
the duty, by some meins, or some mstmmeni, or
some agent, is indispensable , and that so long as
it shall be neglected, so leng the commtice and
business of the country must suffer
The history of the late Bank of the United
States manifests, as clearlj as that of the first, that
the Government, in creating it, wa* acting, avow-
edl), m execution of its duly, m regaid to ihe cur-
rency Fiscal aid, except so far as the furnishing
of a eurreniy was concerned, was hardly thought
of Its bills were made receivable for revenue,
indeed, but that provision, as far as it went, was
obviously a provision for cum ncj Currency for
the revenue, how eve), was not the leading object.
The leading object was cunency for the country
The condition of things, at that tune, was very
much like fh.it which now exists The revenue of
the Government was entiiely adequate to all its
wants, but its operations « ere all obstructed by the
derangement ol the currency, and the people were
as bad off as the Government The banks, or
most of them, had suspended payments Their
paper was depreciated m varous degrees, the ex-
changes were all d sord red, and the commerce of
the country thrown into confusion Government
and pe iple were all neh, but, with all their riches,
they had no money Both misfit apply to them-
selves what Mr Addison, being a much leadier
vvnter than speakei, said of himself, when he ob-
seived, that although he could draw for a thousand
pounds, he had not, a guinea in his pocket
Mr Mad 'on, at that time, was fres dent of the
United States He had been one of the opposen
of the fust bank, on con*t tutional grounds, but be
ha 1 yielded his own opinions lo ihe general sentí
ment of he country, and to the consideration that
the pow er had been established and excrc ised He
was not a mm who cained his respect f< r himself,
and his ewn opinions, so far is to overcome his
lesppct fjr all othei men's judgments Wise men,
sir are sometimes wise enough to sin render then
own opinions, or at least to see that there is a time
whpn questions must be considered as si tt'ed Mr
Madison wis < ne of these In hi annual message
in December, 1815, he siys
" The arrangements of the finances, w th a view
to the receipts and expenditures of a permanent
peace establishment, will necessarily enter into ilif
dehbentions of Congress during the pie'ent ces-
sion It is true, that the improved condition of the
public revenue will not on'v afford the means of
maintaining the faith of the Gosernmcnt with its
creditors mviohte, and of prosecuting successfully
the measure* of the most liberal policy, but will
aKo justify an immediate alleviation of the burdens
imposed by the necessities of the war It is, how
ever, essential to every modification of the finances,
that the benefits of a uniform national currency
should be restored to the community   The absence
