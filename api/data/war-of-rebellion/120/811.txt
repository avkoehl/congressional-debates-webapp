GEO. W. AHL,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., September 12, 1864. *

Bvt. Brigadier General W. W. MORRIS,

Commanding Fort McHenry, Baltimore, Md.:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 5th instant in reference to the close confinement of prisoners of war at Fort McHenry is received, and in reply I beg to say that my letter of instructions of the 3rd instant was intended to apply to all prisoners of war, including spies under trial or under sentence, whether soldiers or citizens, and to all prisoners belonging to the rebel States. Persons who reside in loyal States, arrested for disloyal conduct, are political prisoners only and are not classed as prisoners of war. To such persons the order does not apply, nor does it apply to prisoners temporarily confined as a punishment for violating the rules of the post.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.

WASHINGTON, D. C., September 12, 1864.

Colonel C. W. HILL, Commanding Johnson's Island, Ohio:

COLONEL: Your reference of Colonel Scovill's report for the week ending September 4 is received. I approve your views as to the propriety of building a barrack for prisoners who wish to take the oath of allegiance. It cannot be allowed, but every effort must be made to protect them from violence or abuse from other prisoners. There would seem to be no objection, however, to assigning them to rooms in one of the barracks nearest the guard-house, where protection could more readily be extended to them. If you have ordered the new mess-houses to be occupied, no one has a right to object, and they must be occupied at once. If there are any defects to be remedied, that is a matter to be considered afterward. If the roofs leak much, you will probably find it necessary to cover them with felt roofing, which will make them much warmer in winter.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.

WASHINGTON, D. C., September 12, 1864.

Colonel B. J. SWEET, Commanding, Chicago, Ill.:

COLONEL: Your reference of the recommendation of Assistant Surgeon Sigmund, that prisoners of war employed in the hospital as physicians, nurses, &amp;c., should be allowed the ration of sugar and coffee which is allowed to prisoners engaged on public works, is received, and
