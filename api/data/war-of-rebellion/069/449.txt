JUNE 1, 1864-2.20 p. m.

General MEADE:

I forward dispatch just received from Major Roebling. Enemy still holds the road leading to Woody's house, where Major Roebling is, and his cannon still fire along my front. I gave directions to feel around for Longstreet's right flank some time ago. I shall press up if I find him yielding.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

[Inclosure.]

JUNE 1, 1864-1.30 p. m.

General WARREN:

I am at Woody's house, 2 miles southeast of Bethesda and 1 mile from Cold Harbor. Longstreet was entrenched along that road, and left fifteen minutes ago; he went off in a western direction. I don't think there was quite a division there. Can't find out who commanded the division. Have picked up a few Sixth Corps stragglers. I think from their remarks that the Sixth Corps is at Cold Harbor.

W. A. ROEBLING,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

JUNE 1, 1864-2.45 p. m.

General WARREN:

The Sixth Corps is formed in a semicircle around Cold Harbor; nothing particular in their front. The head of Baldy Smith's column is at the corner leading to Woody's and Bethesda; he says he has orders to go up that road and go between the Fifth and Sixth Corps. I don't think you can expect him before dark.

W. A. ROEBLING,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 1, 1864-4 p. m.

Major-General WARREN:

Generals Wright and Smith will attack this evening. It is very desirable you should join in this attack, unless in your judgment it is impracticable.

GEO. G. MEADE,

4 P. M.

General WARREN.

Your note of 3 p. m. just received.* I was coming back alone, the Eighth Maryland following some distance behind. We have a prisoner. Title is: Longstreet, McLaw's division, Kershaw's brigade, Second South Carolina. They came from Shady Grove last night, and left just before I got there. I shall turn off to the left at Bosher's house, and try and get across the swamp, which is passable in very few places.

W. A. ROEBLING,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.
