traced all their delinquencies to the Government,
and it is in that way that they now are indebted
to the United States But, sir, there is not the
least particle of evidente to show that the Secre-
tary of the Treasury had any reason to suspect
that these men were engaged m hazardous spec
ulations He very well knew that they were at
times delinquent in making the public deposits,
and for this neglect they as often received Irom
him the most unqualified disapprobation and íe
proof As evidence of Mr. Woodbury's vigilance,
perseverance, and fidelity in the discharge of his
duty in relation to this branch of the public sei
vice, I will call the attention of the House to some
extracts of letters written by that gentleman to the
above-named delinquents In a letter to Mr Linn
of 1834, Mr Woodbury says, that, unless he
should exhibit to the Department satisfactory evi-
dence of his having made the deposits prior to the
firstday of December following, accompanied by a
statement ehowirg his receipts and disbursements,
and the balance with which he was chaigeable at
the time of such deposit, " it will be my -painful
*  duty to submit the case for the action oj the Execu~
' ¿toe, and to recommend the appointment of another
' person as your sitc-essw  ''
Again, in the year 1835, the Secretaiy of the
Treasury wmes to Mi llama as follows " I re-
' gret that theie should be occasion to call your
' attention to the omission to rendei your monthly
' duplicate returns to tins office, for the months of
'JNovember and Decembei, and to remind you
*  that punctuality in this respect is indispensable "
Again, in the year 1837, the Secretary writes to
Mr Boyd in the following language " I have to
1 inform you that your lesignation is accepted, to
*  take effect on the first day of the present month,
' and a successor will be appointed     The distuct
'attorney will be instiucted to exeicise as much
' indulgence as the public interest will permit, in
' relation to the adjustment of your concerns "
Here we see the language of aman, who has, him-
self, during the whole course of his life, been re
markable foi punctuality and close attention to
business, offering advice, admonition, and reproof
to those who had   disregarded  these  estimable
qualifications     Iheie we find no neglect on the
part ot the beeietary—no conniving or winking at
Iraud or conuption m any ollicer of the Govern
metit, but a fiun determination that those default
eis should eithei be faithful in the perloimanee of
their duties to the Government, 01 leave the pub
lie sen ice
I he pub ic service they have left, but not with-
out being requited to settle the claims which the
United States had against them, ard to gi^e that
senility wl i Ii, it is hoped, will msuie the ulti
mate payment of those claims But whether this
will be thecise ri not, theie may be an honest
difTeience of opini m it has been said by some
gentlemen, n< t however, in public debate, that as
fast as men betune defaulters and aie dismissed
jiom office, hey join the 1 dcral par y Ifthisbe
the f ict with the above mentioned cases, 1 hould
think hat tmi_,htl>et inewhat doubtful whether
those debts \ ou d be ] aid but if these men still
hold to their pilme I inlet,! it\, that f u t would go
veiy far towards cor viiicm^ me that those claims
would finally be extir guisl ed by an honest pay
rnent But wbe her these der ts shall ever be paid
to the Gove nnient, is immateii«I as to the issi p
which is now before the country That is,
whether the Secieii y of the Treasury was, in
any way oi mannei, instrumental in producing
the results which have been mentioned ' This is
the question, and I am fully peisuaded that any
man who knows Mr Woodoury will answer in ,
the negative
I am corfirmed m this opinion by a recent ex
pressionof a poition of tne people of INew Hamp
shire,   relative  to   this distinguished   statesman
Moie than e ght months after Jus document lela   t
tive to defaulting collectors, &c , was published
to tne word, and after toe sovereign people had
had   ime to " read and reflect " upon the subject,
at a laige  D mooiatie con\ention, he'd  m   the i
county of StraFurd, a county containing a popu-
1 a ui of neerly sixiy t> ousandinhabitants, on the
19th December last, the f rliowing resolution was
s lo ited    '  1 hat the Hon   Levi Woodbury, the
' abie financie1' and «talesman, merits the warmest
' approval of his countrymen, especially those of
' his native State, for the distinguished, unfaulter
' mg, and efficient aid he has rendered the national
' Executive in those trying exigencies which have
' occurred during the preceding and present Ad-
' ministration " Here, sir, is a testimonial from
a portion of the intelligent and vntuous yeomanry
of New Hampshire, who are as competent to
decide upon a question of this sort as ourselves,
approving of the conduct ot Mr Woodbury m
the strongest and most comprehensive manner.
Against testimony like this, a few unsuppoited
denunciations can have no influence Such a
couise must injure the assailant moie than him
who is assailed
Sir, 1 ask those gentlemen who have conducted
this assault upon the Administration, why it is
that they make at this time such a boisterous out-
cry against Mr Woodbury, for giving a little in-
dulgence to a few receivers of money for the sales
of public lands' Let me remind those gentlemen,
as well as this House and the country, of what
took place in 1837 1 ask those gentlemen to rec-
oncile, if they can, their conduct on that occasion
with the couise they have thought propei to pur-
sue at the present time Beside the indulgence
then given before suit, to near eighty hanks, as
deposit agents, from May to October of the yeai
above mentioned, for twenty millions of dolíais at
first, and then for five or six millions, the Treasury
Department gave tune and indulgence to numetous
meichants, on duty bonds, duringthe same period, for
neailyfive millions more, inout.ii all wlre in dl
fault to the Government This was the exer-
cise of a sound and legal discretion, and proved,
in the end, beneficial to the United States Con
gress sanctioned all this in September of the same
yeai.and extended the indulgence still fuither
Both of these happened, also, ajlei lealdejatdlsh&i
been ascertained,and were not previously, like the
short time taken by the Departmentand the Presi-
dent, exercising the same sound and legal discre-
tion, in the case of the receivers, to inquire if a
real default had occuired,and the money would
not, without suit, be deposited as oidertd Yet
the hue and cry is, that the last is impeachable, but
the fust was right' What glaring inconsistency
and miseiable caviling'
Mi Ch urman. it has been said, also, that this
same document pi oves foity other cases of defal-
cation, as gross as those which have been named
This, I presume, must have been intended as a
mere figure of speech, for 1 can find nothing in that
document to wanant me in coming to any such
conclusion My impression is, that the great body
of evidenca is the other way If gentlemen will
cximine the reports nude to the Department by
Mi West and Mi Ganesche, they will be satib
Red that theie are but few other cases of neglec'
' on the pait of íeceiveis  of public  moneys, aid
I that most of the land offices were extieme y well
conducted In proof of this fact, I will refer the
House to the following extracts ftom the leports
of those gentlemen, merely as a sample      Mi
| Ganesche, in speaking of ihe officeis in Louisiani,
says   " The two officeis bear very good chaiacters
j They are both intelligent and, as far as 1 could
)udge, disposed to do justice, at d to accommodate
every one " Mr West, in his lepoit upon the
office at Mineral Point, Wisconsin, says "As to
the state of the office, it k now, upon the whole,
j satisfactory, and all the hooks appear to be well
kept " The receiver states the reason vhyhedid
' not take to St Louis, in Decembei, 1835, all the
money to deposit, was that the bank would not
leceive some of the Ne v England paper which he
had taken for land, and which would be received
at Detroit, when he should make a deposit tf ere
1 could continue my quo ations to a much greatei
extent, to show tba> the land offices in otherStates
are kept to the entire satisfaction, both of the Gov
einment and the people, but I think it wholly un-
neeessaiy Enough has been adduced, Í tiust,
to prove that the above document is not what it
has been represented to be by the enemies of the
Administration
i      The last case which has been produced, for the
i pmpose of following up the attar k up in Mr
Woodbury, and, through him, upon tn-Adminis,
tration and its fuends, i*> tli'U of Samuel Swait
wout, the late collec or oí ¿tew "i oik     It 13 Hue
that soon after General Jackson came into office,
he appointed the above named individual coilectu 
of the customs at the great commeicial emporium
of the country This was done, however, con
trary to the wishes of many distinguished mem-
bers of the Democratic paity, who were better
acquainted with that individual than that enlight-
ened, upright, honest, and single minded states
man But so strongly were his pretensions urged
upon the consideration of the Executive, that the
appointment was given to him It seems, from
what has been said here, as well as elsewhere,
thatMr Swartwout rendered himself so acceptable
to the merchants of New York during the fiist four
years that he filled that station, that they, with
one accord, recommended his reappointment to
that office, and, as extraordinary as may be the
fact, from the time of his appointment to Novem-
ber last, there was nothing known, or overt, upon
which to rest a suspicion against the fidelity of Mi
Swartwout At this time, a report was made to
the Treasury Department that Mr Swartwout had
defrauded the Government out of one million and
a quarter of the public revenues of the countiy
The gentleman from Virginia [Mr Wise] and
the gentleman from Mississippi, [Mr Prentiss,]
and other leaders of the Opposition in this IIous",
have commented upon this ease with great sever-
ity, but I think with veiy trifling effect They
say that, admitting that no peculations upon the
Government funds were discovered while Mi
Swartwout continued in office, yet he left the office
on the 28th day of March la=t, and of course that
this enormous fiaud mubt have been discovered
prior to November, the time mentioned n the re-
poitof the Secretaiy of the fiea«uiy This at first
view may seem to be plausible, but when we come
to take into consideration the requirements of law,
and the magnitude of the business which comes
from this one office, it might be quite as suipus-
lng that the defalcation was detected so soon ss it
was 1 admit that Mr Swartwout went out of
office on the 28th day of March last But the law
gave him thiee months to make out and transmit
his quaiteily accounts to the Department, and, as
heretofoie observed, such has been the magm ude
of business at that office, that the colic-tor has
generally been indulged with some weeks, and oc
casionaily with a month of time, moie than that
allowed by law, all of which was taken in the
piesent instance, so that these accounts weie rot
received at the First Comptiollei's office until the
middle of July or the first of August last
Well, sir, before Mr   Woodbury could  know
anything relative to  the  accountb between Mr
Swartwout and the Government, they must be
examined by the propel accounting officer of the
Tieasury     Will any gentleman pietend that the
quaiteily accounts of the collector of New York—
a place where thiee fourtl s of the revenue of the
countiy, on imporfs, is collected—can  be exam
ined, audited, 01  settled, in a day, a week, 01 a
month >   No, sir, theie is not a gentleman here, or
elsewhere, whose mind can embrace the magni-
tude of the business of tint office, who will rot
I   willingly allow  to  any accountirg officer  three
months, at least, to accomplish such a Herculean
task     We'l, sir, grant this fact, which is ore that
J   must, rs 1 thii k, be planted I y evei y candid man,

fust o' Augusl, not more than   fifteen   days, at
most, after the accounts leached the First Oomp-
'  trailer's office, so as to heve prevented his escape
I to Englafd 111 the Great Western?   This was im-
possible      On  the  first of August,   when  Mr
|  Swartwout left the country, the First Auditor of

counts even a cursory reading     Much leso could
