Lieutenant Colonel J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff, Department of Washington:

COLONEL: One hundred of the Eighth Illinois Cavalry, of the squadron at Fairfax Station, have just returned from a scout with fifteen rebel prisoners of Kincheloe's band. Lieutenant DeLaney's horse, and one of the men who captured him, is among the number captured, all without the loss of a horse or man on our side. I hope Mosby himself will soon return. The Eighth wants one more chance at him.
