Mr. BELL in announcing to the House the death
of his colleague, the Hon JAMES ST ANDEFER,
said
Mr Speiker The melancholy duty has been
assigned me, by my colleagues, of announcing to
the House the death of one of o ir numbei
Jamfs   Siandfper,   while   on  his journey   to
this place, in  order to entei upon his duties as a
member of th o House, was, on the 20th of last
month, suddenly ai rested bv the hind of the great
destro) er of human ex stenee.    B} th s 11 evocóte I
event, the country is deprived, at a period of more
than common interest and difficulty, of the services
of a most devoted and patnotic public servant, and
this House of an honest and worthy membei     My
late colleague was remarkable for an equanimity of
temper, and a kindness of feeling, combined with a
justness of perception mall the cencems of life, at
least of ordinary occurrence, which without the ad-
vantages of early culture, or of boo s, at anv time,
procuied foi him throughout a life, \ Inch was not
shoit, the respect and esteem of mipf¡ ous friends,
and raised him to the nnK or a useful Uul lrprile
nous citizen      The some  qualities ot heait pnd of
mmd, aided by a reputation ft i  honest} winch he
nobly earned, and eonliiiued  to   maintain  by the
most crapulous legaid foi  tiutU and justice ¡a all
his transactions, public and private, caused him to
be lepeatedly chosen to the Legislature oí his own
State—of which body he was a useful and respect-
ed member      He was, for many \eais, a membei
of this, and I am sure that Ins quiet and  unobtiu-
sive manners—his punctual discharge of all me du-
ties assigned him, in the organization ot the House,
must have secured the  íespeet  of his  associates
To these evidences of his worth, I might add, that m
the late war with Great Britain, he approved himself
an intrepid soldier       He  was, above most men 1
have  known, who have usen in any degree into
public view, under simdai circumstances, fieefrem
the pride and vanity of mere station nevei anxious
to appear what he was not, content to be classed
with the useful and faithful   he n ade no pi cten-
sions, had. no aspnalions, bet ond  his real deserts
If, therefore,mj lamented colleague cannot be slid
toha\e possessed anj ol those shining endowments
which are requited to make a fuure in th « House,
which strike our fane), oi cemmard oui  admira-
tion, he might still justly 1?)   claim  to othei and
humbler attributes w hich, upon the the w hole, con-
stitute a chaiacter of solid ment, and often one of
moie enduring fame, and that the due and used ti,-
bute of respect be paid to his  memorj, by this
House, I move you, sir, the lesolution uh'eh 1 hold
in my hand
Resolved, That as a testimony of respeet for the
memory of   the   decased, the   membei--   of this
House will go into mourning by wearing crape on
the left arm for thuty days

the President hid leconmended to Ci ngr ss, and
which are sanctioned m the repoit rt the Secretary

erwise, for the purpose ot meeting the exigency of
the Government and the wide-spiead distiess oí the
countiy, would recene no hindrance, obstruction,
or delay from hum, (Mr W) He would content
himseli with a short statement ot his judg-
ment upon them, as they should come before us,
and he would leave them, m the hands of those
majorities in both Houses, known to be favorable
to the existing administration He beseeched those
majorities, that as soon as ihey could make up their
own judgment as to these measures, they would
pionounce ltin the form of law. They had the
power, they had the responsibility, JFor one, he
should do nothing to obstruct the prompt exercise of
that power—nothing to dimmish the just exercise
(I that responsibility. Connected with the com-
mercial interest, and as a resident of a commer-
cial place—connected with the manufacturing:
mteiest, with a State deeply mteiesled in manufac-
tures—with some knowledge, certainly not beyond
that ordinarily possessed by others, he thought he
saw a pressure upon the labor, the industry, and
the business of the countiy, which called loudly
for immediate relief, and he saw a condition of
things connected with this, no matter what had
given rise to it, which demanded fiom the Govern-
ment the efficient and prompt interposition ¡of
Congiess. He hoped that the earliest consi-
deration would be given to the measure,
and that if it should not pass the Senate,
another might be proposed, and if it should go to the
othei bianch, would receive then sanction and sup-
pon 11 it should be deemed necessary that the
otl er m< ?suics, with this, shou'J be presented (o
the consi leiation of the Senate logcmei, -id which
were calculated to íelieve the tomuiurit), he trust-
ed that the chairman of the Committee of Finance
would piesent them at a veiv early day, so that they
might be acted upon immediately.
Mi CALHOUN fully concurred w ilh the Sena-
tor fiom Massachusetts, that if was due to the
countiv that there should be a full and eaily consi-
deiationof the measures of relief to be proposed
But it was highly important that the whole ground
should be presented, so that each measuie might be
discu'sediut only upon its particular merits, but
