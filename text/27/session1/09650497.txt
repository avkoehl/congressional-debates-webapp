27th Cong....1st Skss.                                       Bankrupt Bill—Mr. Barnard.                                 "~    '             h7oí Rep*.''
He was afraid the Senator from New Hampshire was about to
persuade them to do an art of injustice, andof vei y impolitic
injustice, although he ceruinly intended no such thing He was
the more afraid of this, because it appeared that a bill embrac
log the same principle with that of the amendment had been
passed by ths Senate at a ionner session, although it had fortu
nately failed m the f thei House
Let me say (he went on to observe) that m so far as the Sena-
tor seek£ to repeal the first section of the act of March S, 1837,
prospectively, with due legard to vested rights and just expec
tauons, I am inclined to agiee with him It is very worthy of
consideration, whether the widows or children of all persons
■Who shall hereaftei, under whatever cncumstances, diem the
naval service, should receive pensions Perhaps it may be ex
pedient to fix a time—I should suggest three months from the
passage of the law—af er winch, the reprebentatives of such as
die, not of wounds or disabilities received m service, but fiom
other causes, shall cease to be so entitled
But the decisive objection to this amendment is, that it goes a
good deal further than this, and seeks to effect a veiy dilfeient
thing It strikes off at once every widow and every child from
the pension list, on which they have been placed under, and by
force of the act of Match 3,1837 Oi lather, still moieoffen
slvely, it cuts off every dollar of provision from them, leaving
them still on You recollect, sir, that that act declares that n
any person shall have died, or stia'l afterwards die, m the naval
service, his widow, if one be left, shall receive a pension equal
to his half pay, until her death or marriage, ind if there he no
widow, his children shall receive the same provision until they
come of age Undei that act, and invited by its liberality, many
persons have entered, or have remained, m the naval service,
and have died in it, their widows or children, and the widows
and children of those who had died before, have come foi ward,
proved their title within the law, obtained then certificates be
come inscribed on the lolls, and have been receiving the stipu
lated ptovision of grace, policy, and justice, down to this mo
ment These, all, the amendment of the Senator ptoposes to
stnkeoft at ablow, without notice without discrimination
I submit to the Senate, that this is a harsh proc edin  not
legal, not honorable, not politic It goes a great deal too far
Tu his zeal to correct hasty and improvident legislation—for
such the actof the 3d of March may be admitted to liavebeen
—he would make us disappoint hopes and cause suffering
more than is necessaiy, and therefore more than is right Sir,
if our legislation has been objectionable, let our return to a
wiser system be marked by kindness, temperance and the
smallest possible inPiction of intermediate distress It would
be unfortunate to expose ourselves to the ¡sarcasm that our
wisdom was worse than our folly, and that out correction of
error did more mischief than the commission of it
The persons whom this amendment would thus suddenly
strike outofyoui books, are about two hundied and seventy
widows and ninety five children This is about the number
who are in the actual receipt of pensions under tins act The
widows receive, on an avetage, each one nun Ire! and elshtv
seven dollars per annum, and the clul 1 en one hundied and
twenty one The whole annual amount we pay them, there
fore, is fifty four or fifty five thousand dolíais To save this
sum to the people—I do not know what fiaction of a cent a
piece it would be—you are to deprive this n umber and this de
scnption of persons, in an instant, of so important a provision
of grace or of right
l\ow, I say, first, that this is a harsh and unkind proceeding
If it were legal, or honorable, or politic, it is austert.—it is
cruel The misfortune is that you have yourselves induced
these persons to tely on thib pro\ lsion You disappoint just
expectations The provision is a con&iderable one To some
of them it is no doubt a laitte part of all they have m the
world Their calcu'atiotis have been made on H Then little
plans of life—their social positioi—their contracts—the houses
they live m, the schools they go to, have beui deteimined by
it They have done, and have neglected to do what they
would not have done oi neglected but for this They have ta
ken irrevocable steps on t ie expect ltton of it They have en
joyed it so lone, and you have promised it to them so abso
lutely,3thav they rely on it with as much confidence as on the
rismsr of to morrow's sun Su, those orphans have become
our children By their country's adoption they are het chil
dren, they come for their accustomed and daily bread, and she
gives them a stone'
I submit, sir, that such a thing is not to be thought of fit it
that the grant of the pensions was improvident at first be u
that you have indiscreetly excited these expect itions—the ap
propriate penalty which we pay for such kind of legislation is,
that we cannot instantly retrace our steps, aud that we must m
dulge the hopes to which we have given birth, cost what it will
Let all reforms of our policy be attended with a considerate
compassion for those whom its abuses, wi'hout their fault have
led to rely implicitly on the steadfast wold of theircouniry
But is there not, m the second place, a deeper objection to
this amendment Have we not contracted to pay this pioi ision,
and conferred a vested right to it! Let me rea J the first bection
of the aci
"Beit anacled, $c That if any officer, seaman, or maune
have died, oi may hereafter die, in the naval service leaving a
widow, and, if no widow, a child or children, such wiJow, and,
if no widow, such child >r children, shall be entitled to receive
half the monthly pay to which the deceased would have been
entitled under the icts regulating the pay of the navy, in force
on the first day of January, 1835, to commence from the time
of the death of such officer, seaman, or marine, but in case of
the death or intermarriage of such widow the half pay shall go
to the child or children of the deceased officer, seaman or ma
nne Provided, That the half pay granted to the child or chil
dren shall cease on their death, oi on their attaining the age of
twenty one years "
Now, what is the 1 gal meaning of thisi It declares, general
ly and absolutely, you observe, that if any one shall, after the
passage of theact, die in the naval service, his widon shal have
a sum equal to his half pay unt.l hoi d-ath or mamase and
his children until twenty one It does not say they shall have
it at will, nor for five years nor until sone particulai fund
shall be exhausted 1 he declaiation is general, ind the extent
of the grant is foi life
Take now the case of an officer or seaman enter ne or re-
maining in the service after the passage of tins law Rereads
U, he decides to enter or continue in the service in rellarce on
it, he does so, and he dies Is not your obligation to pay his
widow or his children absolute* Did he not die with it in his
pocket! Why is it not so! It Is true here are not the forms oí
 contract between you and him.   There is no indenture ol
32
two parte In form, here is a mere legislative ordination, ad
dressed to every body But how do you distinguish it from the
celebrated resolnf ion of the Continental Congress in 17S0, which
is in these words
"Resolved, That the officers who shall continue in the ser
vice totheendofthewarshaUalsobeentit!edtjhalfpa> during
hie, to commence from the time of their reduction "
The Senator from New Hampshue in a speech of gieat
ability on this floor in 1828, contended that the ofbeers who
complied with the terms of that resolution became entitled to
half pay on the ground ot contiact, and in that opinion that
isenate was, I believe, unanimous How are the caaes distin
guishableí
I am aware that it may be said that this act is an engigement
to pay out of the Navy Pension fund and out of that iund only,
and that, as that fund has become exhausted, the engagement
of the coun íy i=* completely pertountd, and these persons
have no legal or equitable claim on us plighted faith 01 on its

SPFECH OF MR  BARNARD,

jpinf? in Committee of the Whole on the state of the "Union
on the bill 'to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy
throughout tnet nited Sta^s"—
Mr   BARNARD rose and addressed the committee as foi.
lows
Mr Chairman I muat, I think, have been observed, per
hips by every member of the House,rthat the difficulty which
wp find here in in ging our arguments within the hour rule,
arises frequet lyOom the fact that, in the excitement of speak
ins, we art led off on some one or more points, dwelling on
thorn unconeciou ly, until we recover out recollection only to
find that other points of equal or greater importance must he
wholly passed <ner Now, sir, as this is an impurtantsubject,
and ss lam-in emus to acquit myself of the duty imposed up
on me in \e<ni 1 to it, to the satisfaction of the House, as far as
Í unable, and i far as the time, used in the discreetest man
tier, will pert i t, I have thought it most advisable to resort, on
this occasioi tn notes, prepare3 ma moie fullandample man
ner than h is i oen my custom, in o der that, by confining my
tif in my ret íaiks suictly within the ¡units o¡ the matter thus
m;i dov n and ¿lining atthpsame time, some aávaotaíe in the
w¿y oi dtfimteness and precisnn, I may be enabled to run
throt gh a more complete circle of ob ervation than I could
o beiwise ace mphsh
Mr Chairman th1 measure now under the consideration of
the committee has waited long fir. the action of Congress It
i-, now before us, and a;> I fondly hope, m a form and condi
uon to receiv e the final and favorable action of this body Sir,
i bi ipf histoi y of the bill on your table will not, I think, be un
ace ptable to the committee
Tinsel tat measure was taken -up for serious consideration at
the Urst t-es i i of the twenty sixth Congress Two distin-
guisheHena ns—one fiom the State of Mabsachuseusind the
othd Unm is w\ oik—presented to the Senate on notice and
mo ion, atan culy dav in that session, each a hill providing for
a uniform system on the subject of bankruptcies These btlis
were referred t> the Commi tee on the Judiciary The coir
[iuttee took i the subject, and, af er a very laboriousand tho-
rou di mvesti2?tion, made a report m thft shape of two bills of
itb own—one emanating from the majority and the other from
th"1 minority if the committee, and each bill presenting, m i*
self a complete plan for a bankrupt law
The Senate then entered on the discussion of the subject on
the basis of the^e two bills, that of the majority taking the lead,
and that of the mmouty standing as a proposition to amend
Several weeks were faithfully spent mdiscussion, during which
