instant, on which day Colonel McDowell was absent. His clerk, Captain Cowles, was sent for by me, who said he had written instructions from Colonel McDowell not to grant permits for the shipment of this lot of cotton as freedmen's cotton, but allow it to be shipped to G. H. Ellery; that it would be seized at Memphis, &amp;c. As this, which I consider improper meddling with my affairs, made it certain that the cotton would not sell for its value, I ordered the sale to be postponed. I will take further action in the case when I am sure I am right. I expect General Orme will be here in a few days, who will probably secure the rights of the freedmen. I write this to ask your advice as to what steps I should take with the Treasury agents for interfering with my lawful authority. I see in the newspapers that the Executive order of the 24th of September is ordered to be carried into effect by order of the Secretary of War, Numbers 285, and Navy, Numbers 42, the former dated October 6, the latter December 1. There is a saving clause in this order of the War Department which will doubtless command your attention.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

N. B. BUFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EASTERN ARKANSAS,Helena, Ark., December 12, 1864.

Major General J. J. REYNOLDS,

Commanding Department of Arkansas:

SIR: I beg leave to call your attention to the inclosed newspaper article.* C. A. Foster had a pass from Memphis to Helena, and called an me for a pass to proceed to the mouth of White River, exhibiting to me at the same time George H. Ellery's letter to the commanding officer mouth of White River. As I had just received General Canby's letter ordering me to revoke the pass I gave to G. L. Nicholls, I refused the pass and gave Foster one to return to Memphis. This was all. His letter of instructions was not communicated to me. If it had been, the result would have been the same. I learn that this matter is exciting much discussion among the cotton traders, and I think Colonel J. A. McDowell, the Treasury agent at this place, and others from Memphis, have gone to Washington on account of it. Do you know Colonel McDowell's history at Vicksburg, and the abuses which were corrected at that place on the advent of General Slocum? I feel confident of being sustained by yourself and General Canby in the discharge of my duty.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

N. B. BUFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EASTERN ARKANSAS,Helena, Ark., December 12, 1864.

Major General J. J. REYNOLDS,

Commanding Department of Arkansas:

SIR: I had your verbal ordered to retain the Twenty-third Wisconsin at this post until it was relieved by the return of the Sixth Minnesota,
