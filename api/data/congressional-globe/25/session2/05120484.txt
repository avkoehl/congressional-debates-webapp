that line, by the erection x>f military posts,
from the lakes to the lower boundary rof Mis-
souri, for to authorize a very laiige niihtary
force would, with unfaithful agents, relaác the re-
*tmtnts under which the whites were held at pre-
sent. Foi the whole frontier, 2,500 would be en-
tirely adequate, and much more effective than a
very larga number. Mr. B. went on at length to
give other reasons against so great an increase as
that proposed, such as the probable cessation of
the Florida war, the peaceable character of the
older and richer Indians on the frontier, the aban-
donment of a number of useless military posts;&c
and delended the character of the militia and vo-
lunteers fiom the allegations of inefficiency and dif-
ference if expense, brought by regular officers and
others

He regretted that the lateness of the hour, and the reasonable
imp uience ot the committee, would not permit him to iollow
out the proposition into all us consequences
We had been told that there was excitement along the north

not all peace and tranquility until the barbaroub attack upon
the steamer Cai olme, w hen British assassins av, assassins, like
the stealthy Indian shielded by darkness, invaded our torntoi),
destroyed our piopeity, mmdeied our defenceless and slumbei
ing citizens, and then, ior the purpose of obliterating their
cowardly and murderous deed, set file to the ill lated boat, and
sent her blaring ovei the cataract of Niagara? Was not this
enough to aiou*>e the citizens of the vicinity? But add to this
the insults, contumely and threats, with which tho Govern
ment papers of Canada were loaded, add to this the honois
heaped upon the gallant knight Sir Allen McNab, for ihis
biave and heioic, and brilliant midnight piracy And what
Could they expect? How did they know but then own houses

Mr B had said no sticb thing—nothing like it He had «¡fro
cated a moderate increase of the army asnecesaaiy for tbe «xx
g encyofthe timbada for th.6 proper protection of the fron-
tiers As to the Northern or Caaada frontier, he had insisted
upon sending United Stales JioopB there, and of increasing the
army by this bill, so as to enable the Secretaiy of /Warto place
a proper force on that frontier. The citizens íesidmg on that
frontier, had of late called loudly for united States troops The
Governor of New York recommended it, and Mi 8 read art
extract from the letter of the Governoi to the Secretary of War,
dated in his [Mr B s] district on the 3d Tune instant, saying that
the inhabitants there are very anxious, if possible, to have
some regular troops stationed in that neighborhood, that they
would have more reliance on that description of iorce, than on
a detachment of militia icsfclmg along the lines
Mr B said he had also received many letters fiom his own
district, and from other parts of the frontier to the &ame effect,
but he had not said or intimated that the presence of United
States troops was necessary, merely toentoice the execution of
the laws, oi that the courts of justice could rot execute their du
ties without the aid of the bayonet As to ti e courts or civil
tribunals of Vermont, he left it to the gentleman from Veimont
to defend them as he best might put, Mr II said, he had yet to
learn that the civil tribunals of New Yoifc had f aikd to do their
duty He knew of no instance in which grand juries had failed
to indict upon pioper testimony, or the courts to eniorce the
laws When the New \ ork courts or junes should iail in the
discharge of their duties, it would be trmemough then to raise
the cry against them He had no fears of my such event But
sir, said Mi B although courts and juries may punish offend
cis, they Cannot prevent the commission ot offences A mill
tary force, properly stationed on the northern frontier, might do
much to pi event the commission ofsuch crime* as had recently
been committed, to repress disturbances and restore quiet, and,
at the same time, to preserve our neutralit> and enforce a rJK'd
observ tnce of om treaty stipulations For these reasons, as well
as to afford adequate and propel protectn n to tha frontier, Mi
B &jid he had, and shouM continue, to ur°"e the necessity of a
resular militai y fon e upon the northern fiontiei
