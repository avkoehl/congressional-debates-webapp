Issue of Treasury Notes—Mr. Rhett.
H. of Reps.
perty and the pi ice of ¡abor float upon its agitat d sur-
face, let them rise wuhils expansions and fall wimus
contractions, and then, Sir, gentlemen mav antici-
pate every five year  the íeturn of the "awful
winters" referred to by the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania. One of them is now approaching—an
awful winter indeed for the poor, thousands will
be struck down by poverty and want Sir, I
do not ask gentlemen for their charity. I make no
appeals to their humanity, but m the name of
HIM who made us all, I entreat them to spare
them their taunts—do not stigmatize them—let
these poor laborers die in peace and of famine, m
a land overflowing with the richest abundance
Pardon these victims ot your policy, should they
in their last hour pray that t^e r country might be
delivered from your calamitous "credit system "
Mr Chairman, upon the  firmness and mtcgn'y
of the people of this country, at the present crisis,
depend the condition of oui society and the cha-
racter of our Government    It is evidently a strug-
gle tor power by some of the corporations of this
country, but I trust not all of them    It is a great
issue, for every thing moral, social, and political is
at s,take  On such an occasion, gentlemen may well
discard their prejudices—republicans have been se-
parated on party grounds, but not on principle—
they may readily unite when  a question arit.es in-
volving the welfaie of the peop'e, and the very ex-
istence of free Government.    In  a cause so just
Me have little to fear, and every thing to hope     I
can not believe that in the appioachmg contest we
shall lose one sincere friend of this administration
Some have, I think, piematurely decided upon (he  '
measure now proposed, they  have denounced it
without proper examination     I am sure no sound
republican can, upon deliberation, be  ultimately
found   against    it       While    sir,   on   the   other
hand,   the   proposition   to   separate   bank   and
State   must    rally   and    unite   the    democracy
of this country, by  whatever questions they may
have been hitherto divided     They will never con-
sent that the Treasury of the United Slates shall be
controlled by the stock exchange of Wall street, or
of the Royal Exchange, that the publicrevenne shall
be agam made instrumental in augmenting the
disasters of the countrv, and that the Government
snail be  periodically   embarrassed for   want  of
means, by en*rustmg i's funds to institutions whose
fate depends upon the slightest counter movement
in any part of the commercipl Mstem of the world
Nor, sir, can I believe that anv sonn I republican is
prepared to substitute me «edit of oui corporations
for the common medium and common standard of
the world    No, sir  on these questions the demo-
cracy will be found united, as they always ha\e
been whenever the honor or the interests of their
country viere involved, as they are at Represent
crisis     Let  not gentlemen  deceive themselves,
their victories always come with oui   diamines,
and disappear with leturnmg   pinspentv      The
concentrated power upon vvh'ch they depend cannot
yet regulate the succession to the Presidency
Sir, I have de'ained the committee too long
We chal'enge gentlemen to the vote. Let the gen-
tleman from South Carolina declaim over his " iron
none/ and black b oth," let gentlemen denounce
the measuit as an expedient or an experiment, let
them call it a Sub Treasury scheme, or by w hat
name they pleas?, but let them afford us an oppor-
tunity to test its advantages to trade, to banks, th®
Treasury and the country We fear not the results
of the experiment.
SPEECH OF R. BAR MWELL RHE FT,
Or South Carolina,
In the House of Representatives, Septemb'i 29, 1837—
On the bill authorizing an  issue of Treasury
notes—
Mr Chairman I shall follow the sngges'ion
mide by the chairman of Committee of Ways
and Means, and eons der all the bills upon your
table, as constituting one svstem, although contain-
ed in different bills. To the bill authorizing the
Treasurer to issue Treasury notes, I shall propose,
as amendments, that these notes shall Seen no interest,
and that the Seeretaiy be authorized to issue ano-
ther kind of paper—bills receivable in payment of
the public dues. When the bill regulating the depo-
s tones of the public money shall come up for con-
sideration, I shall also move the amendment I send
to the Chair, providing foi a gradual dissolution of
all connection between the Government and the
banks, dispensing entirely, m the cour e of three
years, win the use or reception of their paper, and
usng them only for the safe-keeping of the public
money by special deposites By these amendments,
the Government will have the option of issuing
their Treasuiy notes bearing no interest, or bills,
receivable in payment of the public dues, the Go*
vernment will be separated Irom the banks—the
public moneys be kept in the banks on special
deposite—and the levenue be collected either m
Government paper or specie There is but one
other alternative befoie the committee to this sjs-
tem m this shape, or by other modifications, and
that is the project of the gentleman from Virginia,
(Mr Garland,) to reunite the Government to the
State banks, receive their pap<>r m payment of the
public dues, and make them, as heretofore, the
general depositories of the money of the country
These are the two projects for consideration
If, sir, we are to have Treasury notes, I prefer
that they should net bem inkiest In issuing these
notes, it is not our object simply to raise money,
or to pay debts, but, in the paralytic state of the
country, we want a medium m which the revenues
of the country can be easily collected, and domes-
tic exchanges be carried on without embarrassment
to the banks If these notes bear interest, their
circulation will bp impeded, if not stopped entirely,
they will be retained on hand as investments Nor,
sir, do I think the objection, that if ihey do not
bear interest they will fall below par, is well
founded Although they cannot be employed lihe
spec e m paving debts abioad, they will answer a
function which specie cannot perform, m carrying
fn the exchanges of the countiy This peculiarity
of nsefulne-s, m the present situation of the coun-
try, will moro than counterbalance any other advan-
tages which either bank notes or specie may
possess over them as a medium of circulation
But, sir, I prefer, to Treasury notes in any shape,
the medium I propose— bill receivable in payment of
the public dues      A Treasury note, is a promise to
pay, for the redemption of which, specie must be
collected and reserved.      A bill receivable in pay-
ment of the public dues, is merely a promise to re-
ceive, and has its promise fulfilled when leceived,
the one, requires the abstiaetion of a large amount
of specie from circulation—the other, not only ab-
stracts no specie from circulation, but -Bill actually
be equivalent to an additional supply of specie to
the amount of the issue     The one, may bring the
Government m collision with the banks m the de-
licate posit on in which they will be placed when
they resume specie pa>ments—the other willgve
the Government the means of col ectin^ its revenue
without enuenching m the least upon the resources
ot the banks    The one, is intended as a tempo-
rary expedient, it is a oebt, and the debt must soon
be paid, the other is merely an instrument ofcol'ec-
tion, and can be kept out for ever, and be expand-
ed or contiacted as the wants of the country for
the purposes of exchange and collection may re-
quire.    For these reasons,  I piefer,  to Treasury
notes, bills receivable m pajment of the  public
dues.
But, Mr Chairman, the same objection will be
urged to this kind of papei which has been urged
against Treasury notes net bearing interest—they
will fall below par Their appreciation or de-
preciation wdl entielv depend upoa the great
principle of supply and demand If there are more
bills in circulation than are needed for the pur-
poses of exchange and the collection of the reve-
nue, they will depieciate, if less, they will use in
value This kind of paper is not an untried experi-
ment, and new in the historj of finance Itlvsbeen
tried and used with success m far w orse times, and by
far feebler Governments than our own The very
first paper money iss led m America was of th'S
kind Upon the failure of the first expedition
against Canada in 1G00, the Province of Massa-
chusetts la d a tax upon the people to meet the
expenses, but as the sold.eis were impatient, and
would not wait until the tax could b'e coHeétéd, ttfls
Government issued  notes, "which tone lo- be ¥e-
cewedfm payment of the tax and alt other páyméiíts
in the Treasury."   Before the time wheft the Muxes
were to be collected, the notes of course depre-
ciated, be ause there was no demand foí théínl
but, " as the time of payment of the tax approaefted,
the credit of the notes was raised, atíd, the Go-
vernment allow mg five per cent, to those-who paM
their taxes m notes, they became better than money.
The   Government,   encouraged   by   the   restora-
tion of credit to the bills,  aiierwards issued others
in charges of the Government    They obtained
good ciedit at the time of their being issued.   The
charges of Government were paid m this mSriner
from year to year.    Whilst the sum was small, sil-
ver continued  the measure,  and bills continued
their value "*   Thus, for twenty years in Massa-
chusetts, until the year 1711, the revenue of the
Province was collected in bills receivable in pay-
ment of the public dues, which maintained an equal
value with specie.    In this year, to defray the ex-
penses of a second expedition to Canada, these notes
were greatly multiplied; of course they fell imme-
diately below pai, and went on depreciating \flMh
every additional issue, because the supply exceeded
the demand    More notes were put into circula-
tion than were needed for the collection of the
revenue, and for payments to the Treasury. Another
instance of the effects of receivability inpayment of
the public dues, may be seen m the continental mo-
ney issued by the confederation m our revolution-
ary war, for the coercive enactments were futile in.
sustaining the papei.    So  long  as the issue was
moderate, it sustained its par value with gold and
silver.    Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Payne testify, that
until the issue exceeded nine m dlions of dollars,
there was no depreciation, and when forty-six mil-
lions were issued, the depreciation was but one per
cent, but, when it reached three hundred and fifty-
seven millions,  in  the midst of a revolution, of
course the depreciation  became several hundred
per cent ; and this depreciation would have taken
place, (although not to the  larne, yet to dn enor-
mous e-ct nt) if the issue had been gold and silver,
instead of paper money    Three hundred and fifty-
seven milhons of specie, was probably forty times
as much specie as was then used m tho country
for the circulation of the products of its labor. The
effect of such an addition lo the circulation, would
be to make forty dollars buy what one purchased
before    Although, m relation to each other, the
products of labor would remain the same in value
—as money became cheaper, every thing would
nommalh rise in value    The great error of our
fathers was,  in   supposing-, that money of any
kind could be multiplied indefinitely, without any
regard to the great principles of supply and de-
mand    ' Do you think, gentlemen,  said a mem-
ber of Congress, that I will consent to load my con-
s ituents with taxes when we can send to our prin-
ter and get a wagon load of money,  one quire of
which will pay for the  whole''"    Had  they pro-
poittoned their issues to the amount of taxes to be
raised, or limited them to the wants of the circula-
tion, the continental currency would never have
matenally depreciated    But their s tuation was a
peculiar ®ne    The confederacy could not «ffect
loans, and by the  articles of confederation they
could not tax the people directly    Their only ex-
pedients for carrying on the war w ere fighting and
paper money, and m y freely used both.   Great
Britain, also,  after the suspension of specie pay-
ments by the Bank of England, from 1797 to 1823,
exhibits  another strong instance of the effect of
leceivability in pajment of thepub.icdues, to sus-
tain a papei issue    The notes of the Bank of Eng-
land, during this period, werebu* h'tie more than
Go lemment bills receivable m paj roent of the pub-
he   dues,   The   whole  capital of the  bank, of
¿£14 000,000, bad been borrowed by the Govern-
ment, and the bank had stopped paymg specie for its
no rs    The notes, therefore, had neither bank capi-
tal nor specie to support them    Tne fiSo. of the
Government, and their receivability m payment of
the public dues, constituted almost their only title
to credit, and, ior twenty-seven years, this cur-
