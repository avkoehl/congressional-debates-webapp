Colonel ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: Lieutenant J. M. Payne, ordnance officer of post of Greensborough, reports as turned in to him by the ordnance officers of the several commands 8,467 small- arms. There are yet to be turned in the arms of Kennedy's brigade and of Pettus' brigade. The effecive total on 27th instant, at 9 a. m., was, as reported to the assistant adjutant- general's office, 12,106, Pettus' brigade not included. The four- fifths of arms to be turned in by kennedy's briade sould be at least 750, making a total from the infantry of the army of 9,217, Pettus' brigade not being included. I have no evidence that the 12,106 effecative total on 27th instant were all armed. It is generally the case that the arms- bearing men number from 2 to 3 per cent. less than the reported "effective total; " 12,106, less 3 per cent. 363 equals 11,743, four- fifths of which number is 9,394. Theis estimate shows a deficiency of 177 arms, which must have been caused by desertions between 9 a. m. 27th instant and the time when the arms were taken fromthe troops. The ordnance officers of the commands have faithfully discahrged their duties, as far as was possible under the circumstance. I inclose herewith memoranda from ordnacne reports, of dates April 8* and 24; also list of stores tuirned in to the post ordnance officer at Greensborough, and copy of Lieutenant Payne's communication to Captain Jasper Myers, Ordnance Department, U. S. Army. + Herewith also the duplicates of incoices fromthe several commands, which may be useful to General Johnston.

I am, colonel, very resepctfully, yours, &c.,

C. F. VANDEFORD,

Captain, &c., Asst. Chief Ordnance Officer, Army of Tennessee.
