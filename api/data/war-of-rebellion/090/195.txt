that the troops on their right fell back. At the same time at the Third Brigade, which held the left, resting on the pike, having advanced to a very exposed position, came under a terrific fire of infantry and artillery, and was compelled to fall back. Grant's brigade (Second) and the bulk of Warner's brigade (First), however, stood firm, being somewhat covered by a stone wall. The Third Brigade and the Ninety-third Pennsylvania Volunteers were soon rallied and brought back on the line. The division then advanced again, and, charging over open ground, drove the enemy, who was strongly posted behind stone walls, from his first position back upon his second, near Middletown. Following up closely, he was soon forced from this position and driven through the town. The troops pressed hotly after the now broken rebels, without regard to line or order, as far as Cedar Creek, where the command was halted, reformed, and marched back to the camps of the morning. During the advance in the afternoon Stenves' (Maine) battery of light 12-pounders and a section of Lamb's battery (10-pounder Parrotts) were brought up, placed in position by Colonel Tompkins, chief of artillery, and served with rapidity and effect.

I take great pride in recapitulating the services of the division in the operations of this eventful day. At daybreak the division was on the extreme right of the infantry of the army. Immediately after daylight it moved by the left toward Middletown, with a view of gaining possession of the pike and the high ground near the town. On its march it encountered the enemy, formed line rapidly, and immediately advanced, driving the enemy and taking some prisoners. At this time, finding itself on the extreme left, compelled, from unforeseen causes,to halt and occupy a crest 300 yards to the rear, it held this position unsupported and unaided for over an hour after all other troops had left the field, checking the farther advance of the enemy and repulsing every attack, thus giving time to the scattered commands to reorganize and reform. Finally, outnumbered and outflanked, the division moved back leisurely, contesting every inch of ground, about a mile to the north of Middletown, with its left resting on the pike, and in this position served as the nucleus on which the lines of the army were reformed. In the afternoon the division advanced upon the lines of the enemy over almost entirely open ground, in the face of a heavy fire of musketry and artillery, and although parts of the line had to yield for the moment to the galling fire encountered, the mass of the division moved steadily on, driving the enemy from his first position back upon his second, and eventually forcing him from this position and driving him in confusion through Middletown and the plains beyond to and over Cedar Creek.

The conduct of the officers and men was gallant and steady throughout the day. Brigadier General L. A. Grant, Colonel J. M. Warner, Eleventh Vermont Volunteers, and Lieutenant Colonel W. B. French, Seventy-seventh New York Volunteers, brigade commanders, are entitled to great credit. But two members of my staff were present on the field, Major Charles Mundee, assistant adjutant-general, wounded, and Captain Hazard Stevens, both of whom deserve special mention. The others were either absent under orders or engaged in their legitimate duties.

Attention is called to instances of individual bravery and good conduct mentioned in the reports of brigade commanders.

The loss of the division in killed, wounded, and missing was severe, as follows, viz: Killed, commissioned officers, 10; enlisted men, 95. Wounded, commissioned officers, 36; enlisted men, 535. Missing, commissioned officers, 1; enlisted men, 59. Aggregate, 736.*
