evening. Can give no further information about it, as he was on picket. Negro refugees report Hampton's cavalry near Burgess' Mill, on the Boydton plank road, near Hatcher's Run. Young's, Chambliss', and Barringer's brigades are encamped near the mill, with Hampton's headquarters at the mill. No infantry on Boydton plank road farther south that Dyson's place, two miles above Burgess' Mill.

Colonel SHARPE,

City Point:

Deserters from the Forty-sixth Virginia, Wise's brigade, report that all or part of Pickett's division is south of the Apomattox. Have you any evidence of this?

CITY POINT, October 9, 1864.

Lieutenant DAVENPORT,

General Butler's Staff:

We got some information tending to show that Pickett's division or a part of it is south of the Appomattox. Please telegraph me at headquarters Army of the Potomac to-day, saying what you think of that and generally of the enemy's position.

SHARPE,

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Deserters yesterday mentioned a rumor that all or part of Pickett's division had moved to the south side of the Appomattox within the last two or three days. Not being able to locate Pickett's troops Colonel Sharpe was requested to obtain all possible information concerning him. The following telegram from General Butler is all that has been received:

Colonel SHARPE:

Your information regarding Pickett's division I think correct. Four regiments of each brigade left here day before yesterday and went to Petersburg. We have on our front Hoke's and Field's divisions and the local defense. More that four regiments of Pickett's division may be south of the Appomattox, but I have no positive information from the north side of the Appomattox to fix what is there.

J. I DAVENPORT,

Lieutenant and Acting Aide-de-Camp.
