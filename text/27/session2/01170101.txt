protection by a reference to the Committee on Ma-
nufactures   The movement now, be it understood,
on this resolution, was regarded by the gentleman
from Maryland as a bold and undisgui°ed step to-
wards protection. Ay, sir, protection in those words
which always excited a smi e on that floor—pro-
tection peí se, and, sir, I confess, that in this view
of the  question,   I   rejoice   that   the   reterence
has  been   to   the Committee on  Manufactures,
because,  if I  am  to  meet my enemy, let me
meet him in the open netd, let me measure his
strength, and if we are to h*ve a protective tariff
urged on and pas ed fi r the benefit of the manu-
facturers, lei us know it.   I can meet it, <nr    I am
not alarmed at the prospect of combatting it as
snch,in my secpon of tne country,but if gentlemen,
by a reference of ihe subj°ct to the Committee of
Ways and Means, had disguised thur tbject—if
they had told us tna' they we e for laying a tdiiff

As bad been well remarked by the gentleman from
Maryland, the chairman of the Committee of Ma-
nufactures had verily gone back to the precedents
of 1837, the very year preceding the bill of abomi-
nations.   He has appealed to the precedent-, of that
very year for the purpose of •■bowing the example
to be followed no      We are to be thrown back
upon the precedents of that vear and the principles
of 1828  I meet that issue upon the tai ift question   f
tell gentlemen that I will not go for a pro'edive tariff,
and that the precedent of 1827 refeired  to by the
gentleman frcm Massachusetts-, was the act on of
this House immediately preceding the Hill of abo-
minations a bill that  was  is   uciver ally con-
demned by the intelligent among the manu actunng
interest, as it was condemned by the agncultural
interest of the South I tell gen*le  en that I will not
go for a tariff for protection now, nor for the pre-

Practically, to come to the effect of this resolu-
tion, what was it? It was to do now what they re-
fused to do at the la-it se sion It was tnv.n pro-
posed by the colleague of the honorable gen leman
who now reported this resolution to ra se a select
committee for the same object ab the gentleman
now contemplated. It was nothing more nor less
than the same proposition revive 1, with (bis dif-
ference only, that a s and ng committee was to be
employed instead of a select comoi ttee How
long, he asked the chairman of the Committee of
Manufactures, would it take htm to inves' gate the
whole subject of d tí> nff to ptotec'ion'í C uld he
do it m one month, or m «ix months? If he took a
deliberate view of the subject, \\- cntaiuly could
not propose to consid-r it asa revenue measme, for
revenue was needed ituUutly If he proposed to
view it as a protective mea&uie , if wi íes es from
all sections of the country, all distance,, were not
introduced, could jnstice be done, when there was
not a subject of duty, involving ths que tion of pro-
tection, that did not involve interests diametrically
opposite? In laying duties, for protection of the
woollen manufacturers, you have the wool growers,
whose in e ests are to be consulted on the one
hand, while you hive the manufacturers on the

to be acted on at the pre ent session, could the tes-
timony they would in this manner collect be any
other  than  ex parte''    It  could   be   no  other.
The interest which was not only at war with the
agncultural products of the South, but also at war
with the real bona fide capitalists of the manufac-
turers   themselves, (for it  was known that the
manufactures were   at   war among  themselves)
would be the first heard.   It was perfectly under-
stood that whilst the large capitalists of the New
England manufacturers who were able to maintain
their establishments under the pre'ent rate of du-
ties, the smaller establishments were as mucn at
war with them as they were with tbe agriculturists
of the Sou'h     But it s0 happened that the five
thousand dollar men were as ten to one to the fifty
thousand dollar men,  they had more voles, and
cou'd control  the capitalists, and the whole  thing
resulted m the proposition for the benefit of that
smaller horde oí the Norlb, who  were ready  to
rise up like fungous sprouts m the ho bed of protec-
tion    A system so partial, a course «o contracted,
so disastrous to  the general interests of tbe coun-
try, and devised for the benefit of particular inte-
rests alone, he could not countenance at the first
step nor at the last.   As in good faith bound, (a
system he had always found it best to adhere to,)
he had voted against the reference to the Commit-
tee on Manufactures, but at the same time, m all
candor, he had expressed to his friends his satis-
faction at the result of the vote that was taken
Sir, (said Mr W ) I am content with the resuit, I
will ahide it, but to'go ones'ep further than re-
venue justifies, I will never c nsent    It was not a
proper time then,he continued, to go into an ex-
pression of his views on the subject of the tariff,
and he should re erve what h° had to say on that
question,   until -some bill should be  introduced
from the Committee on  Manufacture , either p e
iica'rd on the 1 gins now before them, or on mfw-
mation they might hereaflei obtain    Till then he
should re erve uhat he had to say, and content
himself with the expression of his gra ifiealion that

was appealed to by Mr FILLMORE, chairman
of 'he Commi tee of Ways and Means <o defer
his remarks as the morning hour was now nearly
expired, and suffer a mo' on to be made to go into
Committee of the Whole on tbe til! fur ihe issue
of Treasury notes, after a desultory conversation,
Mr T finally resolved to proceea.
Mr. T then observed that the resolution which
had been moved by the honorable gentleman from
Massachusetts [Mr Salton^tall] cer -iinly was
not what some gentlemen appeared, from tbeir re-
marks, to suppose it to be, but a totally different
thing They seemed to understand it ?s constitut-
ing one part of a grand concerted movement for
tbe protection of the manufacturing m'erest agunst
the interests of all othorsectio~s of ¡he country, or
against the general v.elfare It was no such thing
Non > of the Commi tee on Manufactures desired that
sort or degree of protection which should beprodur
tive of such results They wished such a sys em of
duties ps should at one and trie same t'me ¡ifford a
competent revenue, extend protection over our do-
mes! e industry, and advance ihe general wel - ie
of the whole country Nor was there any thing
m the esoluton which, m the subtest degree,
conflicted with these great ends It had been said
that the resolut on was opposed to the very grounds
on which the reference of the g<-iienl subject ha i
beenma''e to the Corcm ttep on Manuiac urea
Tne grouna taken ua , that the subject had ah>a}s,
heretofore, gone to that commi tee, and such
having been the mvdr ab'e course, if it should
now be chang d, the fin ral understanding
throughout the cotu try would be, that the p*e em
Congress was opp s=d to the po'icy o* ^ran'ing
protection to oui own manufactures
Mr T -aid tie had been anxious, on a former
occasion, when tbe reference was under deoate, to
get the floor, that he migh' reply to the speech of
the gentleman from South Carolina, [Mr Rhett,]
but he had failed in the effort, and now he pre-
101
sumed the opportunity had passed by, as he did
not conceive it would be in order, at this time, So
respond to a speech delivered them.
The resolution so warmly opposed simply asked
leave, on behalf of the Committee on Manufac-
tures, to send for intelligent witnesses and take
testimony m relation to tbe operation oí the tariff,
as it stood, on the general interests ot the whole
coun ry, and what would be the result of certain
proposed alterations in the existing rate of duties:
and however well informed any committee might
be who had been charged with so weighty a duty
as a general revision of the tariff, they could not
be expected to enter upon it without some such
previous mqu.ry Any reasonable man would
expect that such information should be bad before
an attempt was made to change so important a
law Such had been the view of the Committee
on Manufacture'. They had referred to their
consideration so much of the President's message
as related to the subject of discriminating dunes
and the incidental protection of American manu-
factures All that portion cf the mes age which
had respect ta revenue purely, had alreai'y been
referred to the Committee of Ways and Mean : it
was tbe part relating to the protection of manufac-
tures which alone had been confided to the com-
mittee to which Mr T. belonged. The committee
wished to proceed cautiously and UBderstandingly
in the task assigned them: they were desirous of col-
lecting all the information which any member of
the committee might desire to possess, and which
might be within their power The only question
was, in what shape they should be authorized to
receive this1 They desired that the information
might be presented to them under such responsibi-
lity as should render it authentic, and properly
available as the basis of legislation Had the
subject been referred to the Committee of Ways
and Means, that committee would probably have
asked the same privilege
Instead of running a tilt in favor of protection
against every interest m the country, might not the
wish of the committee in making this request have
been directly the reverse? viz of preventing the
provisions for pro'ection from injuriously inter-
fering with other interests? What member of the
committee wished to miure the interests either of
ctmme'ce or agriculture? Their wish was to see
such laws enacted as should foster the prosperity
of all these great interests of tbe country at one
and the same time
Mi. T said he was willing to have the general
I inquiry made by a select committee, but that
would not be at all inconsistent with granting the
power now asked by the Committee on Manufac-
| tures On the contrary, all the lnendsof pre tec-
tion had been desirous of such an mveiti-
| gation, and his friend from Massachusetts had
introduced a resolution to that effect at the extra
session, but it had been retused He must con-
sider it a great misfortune that that r^ solution did not
carry, but the favorable opportunity ihen enjoyed
had gone h,, although a similar measure might
now be adopted He presumed that legislation on
the subject of ose ta hi wouia not end with the pre-
san' s ssirn of Congress. The sjslem would pro-
baoly hereafter undergo revision, but was it not
obviously important that the committee now
charged with a mat'er so important should be ena-
bled to examine witnesses, c-ach in his own trade
or profession, or who resided in i s neighborhood,
ard were thus acquainted with the facts, of the
case?
Here the morning houi having expired, Mr T.
suspended his remarks until to-morrow morning,
when he will have tr" fl or to conclude tnem.
