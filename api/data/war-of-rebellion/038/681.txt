GRENADA, March 20, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Scout Thompson reports, near Corinth, 18th, 4 p. m., most of troops that returned from Alabama gone to Memphis. Squad of cavalry from Chewalla came to Kossuth and arrested 10 citizens; took them to Corinth. No one out from there.

Can't learn force; estimated about 7,000. A well-know citizen writes from Memphis:

Enemy have bought thirteen small boats in which to take Quinby's DIVISION down Yazoo Pass.

COLUMBUS, MISS., March 20, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON, Jackson, MISS.:

Effective infantry force, 431. State militia arms detective. Owens' light artillery, 94 men for duty; two companies heavy artillery, 85 men. Arms deficient. Cavalry, 120 men for duty; bad arms and poor horses.

[C. R.] Barteau's regiment, 235 to 315 for duty. Calibers various. Some unarmed. Weatherall's, Hane's [Ham's], Carpenter's, Warren's, and Cox's State cavalry organizing.

DANIEL RUGGLES.

JACKSON, March 20, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston, Tullahoma, Tenn.:

I have no doubt the enemy intend using the Memphis and Charleston Railroad and abandoning the Mobile and Ohio, north. Enemy's gunboats in Deer Creek and Tallahatchee, but have not advanced since my last report. Affairs at Vicksburg and Port Hudson in statu quo.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, March 20, 1863.

I think it absolutely necessary that one or two cavalry regiments be sent to the northeastern counties of this State, to protect the planters in putting in their crops. I have none that I can send.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, March 21, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston, Tullahoma, Tenn.:

The enemy have abandoned operations against Fort Pemberton, and have retreated up the Tallahatchee.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, March 21, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston, Tullahoma, Tenn.:

Force at Memphis about 2,000. More landing from up river.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, March 21, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston, Tullahoma, Tenn.:

Have you separated the cavalry with General Van Dorn from my command entirely? If so, it very much diminishes my ability to defend the northern portion of the State, as the planting season comes on.

J. C. PEMBERTON.
