All lines being cut beyond Pleasant Hill. Try to get news from Jefferson City by sending scouts from Hannibal and Saint Joseph and North Missouri Railroads. I am sending scouts forward for same purpose.

If the guns which I loaned General Fisk have not been distributed I wish you would send them by express. I wish to aid in arming militia in Kansas City.

Major-General CURTIS:

Thanks for you dispatches. Please keep me posted from below.

JAMES CRAIG,

Brigadier-General.

CHJILLICOTHE, October 8, 1864.

Brigadier-General CRAIG:

Your dispatches authorizing me to call out the militia to the Iowa line have been received. I have sent notice up country for all to be ready at a moment's notice, but have not yet ordered in. When the troops you have ordered reach here it will be enough unless Price sends a column across the river; in that case all will be required, or do you mean for me to order them in at once?

J. H. SHANKLIN,

Colonel, &amp;c.

HAMILTON, MO., October 8, 1864.

General CRAIG:

I have just received information from Major Grimes that Shelby is marching on the Lexington with a heavy force. The commanding officer of the post has transferred all Government property to this side of the river. I sent Shanklin 100 men to-day.

W. D. McDONALD,

Major, &c.
