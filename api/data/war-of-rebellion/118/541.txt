If you have any more Confederate prisoners of war I think it will be best to deliver them as soon as possible. All the papers and rolls relating to exchanges will be forwarded to you after the exchanges have been made.

Colonel WM. HOFFMAN, Commissary - General of Prisoners.

COLONEL: I have the honor to inclose to you copy of letter just received with memoranda* inclosed. I think that Doctor Dixon had better be released. Of Tunstall's case I am not advised. Please show the letter to General Hitchcock and give me information in detail on each of the points presented. Please have noted on the copy of memoranda and opposite each name the position of the case named. I think many of them have been released. If the case of Captain Baylor, confined at Fort Delaware, has not been examined I would recommend that it be as soon as practicable. The effect of keeping the release of a Confederate officer suspended on charges is always to retain one of our own officers in confinement, for while official notice of retaliation is not given I an satisfied that such retaliation is ready practiced.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant - Colonel and Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.

I have in my possession cumulative evidence to the fullest extent of the truth of that statement. The injustice done to him is producing great excitement amongst our people. Why force retaliation in such matters? Doctor Dixon has been in confinement long enough to have been tried a dozen times and yet he is held without trial upon a charge the easiest that can be trumped up against any one. Is this right?

3. Privates Betts, Rider and Oliver, of Captain Gaither's company, First Virginia Cavalry, captured on the 25th February, are now in the Old Capitol Prison. I understand they have been tried as traitors by a court - martial in General Hooker's camp because they are Marylanders. The rumor is they have been sentenced to death. Is this system to be
