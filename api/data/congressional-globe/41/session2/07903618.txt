May 19,
suggestion of the gentleman from Maine I will
say that I feel unaer some obligations to the
gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. Schknck,] who is
absent, to press the appropriations bills, so as
to get them out of the way as soon as possible.
I have no other objection to the suggestion.
Mr. CULLOM. Mr. Speaker, I suppose it
will be within the power of the House at the
expiration of the mbrning hour to continue the
consideration of this bill by a majority vote. I
think we had better do that, and get it out of
the way.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will state that
he has been notified by the gentleman from
New York, [Mr. Kelsey,] who has charge of
the consular and diplomatic appropriation bill,
that at the close of th$ morning hour to-day he
will move to go into Committee of the Whole
upon that bill. Of course if the House should
negative that motion the Chair would consider
this bill as pending before the House.
Mr. DAWES. One .vord more. The busi-
ness of the Committee on Appropriations is in
such a position that it will be no disadvantage
to us if no other appropriation bill than the
consular bill is considered to-day. The gentle-
man from New York is, Ibelieve, of the opinion
that that bill will not occupy the whole day.
The gentleman can make any suggestion he
may deem proper with regard to the disposi-
tion of this matter.
Mr. KELSEY. I am very desirous to have
the consular bill disposed of to-day; and I
have no doubt we shall be able to pass it dur- ;
ing to-day's session.
The SPEAKER. The Chair desires to state
that to-morrow the morning hour will bo
devoted to the consideration of private bills;
and as it will be the third Friday in the month, !
all other business will be set aside at two
o'clock for the consideration of business re-
ported by the Committee for the District of
Columbia. So that there can be no session of
the Committee of the Whole to-morrow.
Mr. LYNCH. Several of the gentlemen
who desire to speak on this bill prefer to speak
on next Tuesday. For myself 1 have no pref-
erence in the matter.
Mr. WOOD. I call for the regular order.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from New
York [Mr. Wood] calls for the regular order.
The morning hour now begins. The gentle-
man from Maine [Mr. Hale] is entitled to the
floor.
Mr. HALE. Mr. Speaker, we present to
the world the astonishing spectacle of a nation
just emerged from a wasting and devastating
war, which disarranged the course of trade in
almost every business relation, and in_ many
instances blotted out sources of former invest-
ment and profit, and yet, under these disad-
vantages, obtaining from the revenues collected
from our people more than is needed for imme-
diate uses. We have proved that we can pay
the running expenses of the Government ad-
ministered on a prudent basis, the interest
upou the national debt, enough of the princi-
pal of that debt to show that it can easily be
extinguished in the lifetime of grown-np men
now living, and yet have, after all these expend-
itures, an annual-surplus, of from fifty to sev-
enty million dollars.
The question then arises, what shall be done
with this immense surplus; or, as it comesprac-
tically before Congress, from what material
interests of the country will you lift taxation ?
And that brings before us the whole question;
of the adjustment of the burdens of taxation
upon the different material interests of the
country. "When that is discussed it has always
been found that there is involved legitimately,
the question of protection—what interest shall
be favored, and to what degree; how far for
the purpose of revenue, and how far for the
purpose of protection? And if any man had
any doubt before whether this discussion could
be carried on upon one plane of this question
without involving the other the experience of
the.Hoppe for the last two months must have
s«Uled the question in his mind. This-Honse
has been for more than two months, up'to last
Monday, engaged in readjusting the burdens
of taxation on the material interests of the
country, arising under the tariff bill reported
by the Committee of Ways and Means.
Now, Mr. Speaker, I have looked on with a
great deal of interest during the discussion,
taking but little part in it, to see the develop-
ments produced here upon this floor in tne
struggle of different interests for protection.
All the leading interests, with one exception,
were thoroughly represented here. Pennsyl-
vania was united almost to a man, without party
distinction, for protection for pig iron and
other iron manufactures from iron ores. The
New England manufactures in Connecticut of
various kinds were represented by that dele-
gation ; the iron manufacturers of Worcester,
in Massachusetts, by the gentleman from that
district, [Mr. Hoar ;] ana the shoemakers by
the gentleman from the Essex district, [Mr.
Butler.] Powerful lobbies were about the
House. The discussion proceeded.
During all this time I watched carefully for
the emergence from this struggle of some in-
dustry that was languishing. 1 waited to see
some suffering interest appealing for assistance
during that discussion. It did not seem to me
that the iron manufacturers of Pennsylvania
were poor men, nor men growing poor. It did
not appear that the proprietors of the Besse-
mer steel patent were poverty-stricken indi-
viduals, or that the manufacturers in Connec-
ticut, or Worcester, or in the Essex district of
Massachusetts, had gone to wreck and ruin.
I did not object to reasonable protection to
them, although in most cases I voted against
the highest duties asked for; but I was Very
clear in my impression that neither of those
presented a question of a great interest strug"
«fling in the throes of dissolution—going to
death for want of protection. But the House
kept at work; two months were consumed,
ana at last, in the morning hour, the select
Committee on the Decline of American Ton-
nage w&s called. My colleague [Mr. Lynch]
spoke ably and eloquently on this great and
important interest and on the pending bills,
which he believes and I believe will in a great
degree remedy the prostration under which
that interest now suffers, and other gentlemen
have followed him on one side and another.
At last, Mr. Speaker, we have before us a
great suffering, languishing, and dying interest,
and this House should tike enough interest in
the question to investigate it thoroughly. Here
is a subject that of right demands the atten-
tion of the American Congress. Its magni-
tude entitles it to our sober thought. It dwarfs
other interests in a fair comparison. When
the war of the rebellion broke out American
ship-building and American commerce filled
every ship-yard on our northern coast with
busy and prosperous laborers, and sent into
every port of the world American vessels,
to draw sources of profit and wealth for. our
people here from the traffic of all nations. It
built the finest ships in the world. It gave
employment and sustenance directly ana indi-
rectly to hundreds of thousands of souls. In
this respect it dominates and towers above
every other interest brought before the House
where a claim has been made for protection.
It contended successfully for the trade of the
world with all other peoples.
While this was so, American ship-building
and American commerce asked no bounty from
the Government. It came here with no lobbies.
It did not when rich seek Government aid to
get richer. When it prospered it did not ask
Government aid to secure higher prosperity.
It was content to flourish by its own efforts.
To-day it does not come here like the wagoner
who prayed to Hercules to lift him out of the
mud. But after it has itself for the last ten
years been putting its shoulders to the wheel
under every circumstance of discouragement,
it now asks only for aid to help it to lift itself
out of the morass. It is prostrate to-day and
needs succor. Its decline is not a thing of the
future. It does not say, " Unless you grant aid
and protection our ship-building will decline
and our commerce will lessen on the seas." It
does not make its claim for help on a predic-
tion based, as other interests have based their
claims, on the question whether Congress will
or will not grant aid. But it is a thing of the
present and of the past. Is is already declin-
ing, it is already languishing, and it appeals to
Congress, showing its record of decline and
almost death.
Mr. Speaker, the figures show this so clearly
that no man can dispute them. The inference
from them is irresistible. I need make no
apology to the House for using, as I shall to
some brief extent, figures that have already
been used by other members; for these figures
present to any view that is taken of this sub-
ject pertinent illustration. Our American ton-
nage in 1861 engaged in foreign trade was
2,642,628 tons; in 1868 it had sunk to 1,565,732
tons, a decrease of 1,07§,896 tons, about forty
per cent. Great Britain in the mean time had
increased her tonnage engaged in foreign trade
from8,179,683 tons in 1861 to 4,265,349 tons in
1868, or 1,085,666 tons. In 1860 the American
tonnage entering all our ports was 5,921,285
tons; in 1869 it had fallen to 3,402,668 tons,
showing a decline of 2,518,617 tons. The for-
eign tonnage entering our ports in 1860 was
2,353,911 tons, and in 1869 it was 6,347,694
tons, an increase of2,993,783 tons.
But a still more clear illustration of the
decline of American commerce than even these
figures is the exhibit as to its earnings at those
two respective dates. There was earned by
American shipping in 1861, $108,347,748. In
1869 it fell to $70,488,945, showing $37,858,303
lost to our foreign trade, lost to the people of
this country, lost in its expenditures, and in
the reviving effects it would have npon a thou-
sand other industries heretofore prosperous.
The following are the tables showing in detail
this result:
