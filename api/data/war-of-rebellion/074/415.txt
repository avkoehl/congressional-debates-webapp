a The effective strength in the above recapitulation includes the pioneer corps of the division, which was not embraced in the effective strength given at the commencement of this official report of the campaign.

b The loss of the Third Brigade is comparatively small, owing to its having been detached May 21, 1864, and sent to Rome, Ga. (which it garrison at present), and not having taken an active part in the field since that date.

c The main loss of the artillery has been occasioned by transfer of Battery I, First Missouri Light Artillery, and muster out.

d This being a veteran division, the main loss during the campaign viz, 57 commissioned officers and 1,038 enlisted men, has been caused by resignation and muster out, by virtue of expiration of term of service.
