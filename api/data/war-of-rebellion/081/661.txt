His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS,

Richmond, Va.:

At 11 last night took breast-works at Howlett's house. Other portions of same line were retaken. Pickett's division now occupies trenches from Howlett's to front of Clay's. Field's division is on the right, but I believe whole of front line not occupied. Battery at Howlett's is being re-established. Saw five vessels sunk by enemy in Trent's Reach. Behind lie the monitors; counted ten steamers within the reach. Enemy made two attacks last night on Beauregard, but were repulsed, with loss-400 prisoners, including 11 commissioned officers
