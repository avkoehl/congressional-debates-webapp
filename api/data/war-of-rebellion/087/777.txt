Brigade, with the Forty-fifth U. S. Colored Troops forming a second line. As soon as our skirmishers entered the woods they engaged those of the enemy and quickly drove them from a rail fence and two lines of rifle-pits to the shelter of their main line of works, which was about 100 yards from the edge of the woods. Directly in front of my left was a house, behind which was a battery which fired at intervals toward the right of our troops. One battle-flag was flying here and another in front of my center. The Forty-fifth U. S. Colored Troops was for a short time detached to General Ames' division, and on returning was posted on the left of the Twenty-ninth. A reconnaissance made, in obedience to General Birney's orders, by Major Bates, of the Forty-fifth, and Lieutenant Marshall, of my staff, found that the enemy's line of works extended at least half a mile beyond our left. The thick undergrowth prevented their seeing more. At 2 p.m. the Eighth U. S. Colored Troops was relieved by the Seventh U. S. Colored Troops, and at 4 p.m. we retired from the woods, and after a short halt at our fist position returned to camp.

A report of casualties has been already sent to your headquarters.*

The Eighth U. S. Colored Troops particularly distinguished itself by its bold skirmishing, and was skillfully and bravely handled by Major Wagner. Captain Camp's company, of the Twenty-ninth, which was also on the skirmish line, behaved very well.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. DOUBLEDAY,

Colonel Forty-fifth U. S. Colored Troops, Commanding Brigade.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. SECOND Brigadier, THIRD. DIV., TENTH ARMY CORPS, October 29, 1864.

CAPTAIN: I respectfully report that this brigade moved at daylight of the 27th to the Kell house, where the Twenty-ninth Connecticut Volunteers, Captain Frederick E. Camp commanding were deployed as skirmishers, and entering the woods speedily drove the enemy's pickets from the line of rifle-pits occupied by them back to their main line of works. Though exposed to a hot fire they held their ground all day and night, not being relieved till dawn of the 28th. They were most gallantly and skillfully commanded by Captain Camp, and proved themselves steady, brave, and reliable soldiers. Captain Camp speaks in high terms of the conduct of his officers and men. I refer you to his report, which is herewith inclosed, for the names of several enlisted men who particularly distinguished themselves. The rest of the brigade, though lying near, were not engaged, but one casualty occurring in the Forty-fifth U. S. Colored Troops and none in the Eighth U. S. Colored Troops. At night the last two regiments were withdrawn to the Kell house, where in the morning they were joined by the Twenty-ninth Connecticut Volunteers. At 3 p.m. the brigade returned to its former camp. A list of casualties has been already forwarded.+

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,U. DOUBLEDAY,

Colonel Forty-fifth U. S. Colored Troops, Commanding Brigade.

Captain MARCELLUS BAILEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
