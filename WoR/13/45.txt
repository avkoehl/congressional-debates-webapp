Sixth Pennsylvania Cavalry, of battle of Gaines' Mill.

CAMP OF THE CAVALRY RESERVE,

In the Field, June 28, 1862.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that in the action of the 27th instant, when the enemy in force attacked General F. J. Porter's corps, three squadrons of my regiment were engaged. I was assigned my position in the field with the Cavalry Reserve, and during the close of the action received orders to be on hand and ready to support the regular cavalry when it charged. Soon afterward received orders to support Robertson's battery and afterward to cover its retreat from the field. These duties were all performed under a very heavy fire from the enemy, and at about sunset I took up a new position in advance of the troops that were rallying near the hospital.

My regiment was the last to leave the left of the field, where our troops had given way, and the perfect coolness and admirable behavior of officers and men enabling me to maneuver the regiment in close column of squadrons and to take advantage of the character of the ground, I was enabled to cover my regiment and prevent a heavier loss in killed and wounded. My men and horses were worn down with previous picket and outpost duty. Some of the companies had not been unsaddled for a week.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICH'D H. RUSH,

Colonel Regiment of Lancers.
