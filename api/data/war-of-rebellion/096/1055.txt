SMITHVILLE, January 14, 1865.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

Seventy-six said off this morning at 7.50 o'clock. I have come here simply to communicate. Fleet moving in line of battle. I must have a regiment to do duty at night. Men that fought their guns as mine did yesterday and will have to do to-day require some rest at night. Both our submarine cables and telegraph wire were cut all to pieces by the enemy's shell in twenty minutes after he opened. Signals cannot be kept up during a fight on account of the obscurity of the smoke. As far as we can see the enemy are on the beach. He did not attack last night; our men under arms all night excepting them. Do not think they can force a passage to-day. Hoke promised me a regiment, I go back in one hour.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.

SUGAR LOAF, January 14, 1865 - 11 a. m.

Major-General WHITING,

Smithville:

Transportation has been ordered for some movements directed through General Hebert. By that transportation 1,000 veterans will be sent to Fisher. What is now effective force in Fisher?

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SMITHVILLE, January 14, 1865.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

General Hebert has handed me your dispatch of this date.* By my orders from Fisher last night he sent six companies to re-enforce that fort, leaving the garrison elsewhere, as you designate in your dispatch. I cannot send troops to Gander Hall, and have asked for troops to relieve the men at night, who have been fighting for twenty-four hours. Dispatch to me from Sugar Loaf, of 11 a. m., just received. I need no transportation, Effective force in Fisher about 1,000, as near as I can say without returns. I am going back there now.

W. H. WHITING,

Major-General.

FISHER, January 14, 1865.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

The best way to re-enforce Fisher is by land through the enemy, or by landing at Battery Buchanan.

W. HA. C. WHITING,

Major-General.

FORT FISHER, January 14, 1865.

General Chickamauga if firing on the beach whenever the enemy show themselves, by direction of the flag-officer and my advice.
