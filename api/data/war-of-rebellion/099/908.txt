Brevet Major-General GEARY:

Send up to-night two brigades. We have in front the whole of Johnston's command, and have had very serious fighting all day. Send your ambulances, putting all sick in wagons. I have consulted General Slocum. If you can communicate with Fifteenth Corsp, state our condition. We expect further attacks in morning. All ammunition (artillery and infantry) should be sent up.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: I am marching on the left, and at the head of the Twentieth Army Corps, which is delayed in its march by bad roads. I am getting plenty of forage, having no trouble. The enemy's cavalry has made several dashes on my flank during the march this morning. Allen's division of cavalry and six regiments of infantry encamped last night about seven miles from Mingo Creek, on the Smitfield road. Whenever I have faced in direction of Raleigh, or on roads leading toward Smithfield, I have found the enemy, and yet he retires without severe skirmishing. All the raods in direction of Raleigh and Smithfield I find strongly picketed. Lieutenant Potter, of my staff, made his escape from the enemy and joined me last night. He reports that we are expected in direction of Raleigh, and that every preparation is being made to meet us about ten miles this side-near Squire Johnson's. I shall march parallel with the Twentieth Army Corps and join you at the earliest possible movement.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. KILPATRICK,

Brevet Major-General.
