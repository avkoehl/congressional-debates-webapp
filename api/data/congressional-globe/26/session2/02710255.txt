Yes, to destroy even a Wilberforce, a Fox, or a
Pitt, in the first moments of exultation after some
party victory. Yes, it is the principle in which
lurk the poison and the peril. • And the great un
known, with indignant eloquence, added "The
laws of England shall not be violated even by your
holy zeal to oppress a sinner "
Mr. "WALKER said his friend from Arkansas
had alluded to the fact that, in 1833, Gales and
Seatoniwere declared to be elected, having received,
according to the tellers ninety nine votes-.when before
Congress reassembled a hundred md ividuala publish-
ed under their signature , that they had deposited
their ballots for Blair and Rives, and m point of
fact, ihough the teller'  announced the election of
Gales and Seaton, that Blair and Rives were
elected. Now this result must have been either
through fraud or mis'ake, he believed it was
through mistake, for he hoped the day would not
come when there would be a recourse to fraud
in either of the two Houses of Congress, to
defeat an election. But whenever it was, Blair
and Rives were duly elscted, aal they proposed, m
consequence uf this fact, that they should be pro-
claimed the Printers to Congress But what was the
ground then taken by the Whig party, and by
Gales and Seaton in editorial articles, which he
had before him, and to which he would call the
attention of the Senate? And these sentiments
were not only promulgated by the paity here at
that period, but they were reaffirmed by the Whig
press throughout the Union in articles republished
from those of Gales and Seaton, who were nowto
be the Printers on the removal of Blair and Rives
In an article published in the National Intelli-
gencer, on the 27th of No\ ember, 1833, ib which
they are giving their reasons why they shou'd be
considered Printers for the two years, they
treat it in precisely the same manner that the elec-
tion of Blair and Rives was now treated, they pro
claimed it was a contract But the following was
their own language
' Passing by other indications of lesser con^eq jence we ai
rive at that contemporaneous one with which ve herran from
Cincinnati concurring in the scheme of the jSew Hampshire
Patriot the Albany Argus,, the New \ork standard <fcc Hav
mg travelled thus fai with us the rcadcl will probablv have
made up his mind by this time that a A liberate plan has been
foimed here to be attempted if the conspirators dare and
■which all the organs ot he Jowtr Cabinet are busily engaged
by dirty and despicable arts endeavoimg to accomplish for un
doing the election of Prmtei made at ü e last session of Con
gress
"This grand project of the cabal, whose existence and dan
gerous influence we exposed to oui readeis in seveial numbers
during the last summer presents itself m two aspects, the one
moral, the other legal "
And here be would call the attention of the Se-
nate to the denunciation of Gales and Seaton of
the attempt to remove them as both ' immoral and
illegal." Such was the charge made by Gales and
Seaton, m 1833, against that act wh'ch was now to
be accomplished by their friends in this body—an
act, too, of which the men who denounced it then
were now to reap the fruit If this were an immo-
rality and an illegality, he would turn it over to the
consciences of gentlemen, when they came to give
their vote for Gales and Seaton to fill the vacancy
now to be created. But he would proceed with
that part ot the article which treats it as a contract
with Gales and Seaton.    It is as follows
"The reason for thus mailing the appointment for each Con
gress at the close of the preceding session, was of course to
enable the contiactor to prepare the necesoaiy materials to
enable him to execute so extensile a work which every man
of business knows it will take several m mths t do After the
person elected has given the required bond the contract be
tween him and the House which has chosen him is complete,
and it is only in case of failure m the proper execution of the
work, or inconvenient delay, tbat the Secretary oi Cieik of
either House can employ another Printer to do any part of the
work Such a thing hab in fact never yet occmred in the
course of fouiteen years practice under the reso ution '
"On the 3d of March, 1821, just at the close of the Congress
next after that m which the above measuie was fust adopted,
the following resolution v, as adopted by the Hou e oi Repre
sentatives
"Resolved, That this House will forthwith pioceed to ballot
for a Printer to execute its work during the next C ong es& ac
cording to the provisions of the resolution 'directing the man
ner m which the printing for Congiess shall be execute 1 fixing
the prices thereof and providing for the appointment of a Prm
ter or Printers,' passed on the 3d day of March 181°.
"Under this resolution, the election was made at the Sixteenth
Congress, for the Seventeenth, and so continued to be made,
from Congress to Congress until the Twentieth Congroas
when,   «pon the recommendation of the Committee of Re-
trenchment, the following resolution was passed, early m Feb
ruary, by both Houses of Congress, and approved by the Presi
dent of the United States
"A RESOLUTION amendatory of a Tomt Resolution passed
3d March, 1819
"Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United Sta es in Co/igress assembled That within thirty
days before the adjournment of every Congiess, each House
shall proceed to vote for a Printer to execute its work for and
during the succeeding Congiess and the person having the ma
jority of all the votes shall be considered duly elected, and that
so much of the resolution approved the 3d day of March, J819,
entitled A resolution directing the manner m which the print
mg for Congiess shall be executed fixing the prices thereof, and
providing foi the appointment of a Printer or Printers,' a& is
altel ed by this resol ution be, and the same is hereby, repealed '
The resolution, too, set forth that, in case of the
non execution of the work, the work might be
done by another Printer, and the contractor should
pav any surplus to the*new Printer that might be
allowed, as damage* for the non-execution of his
duty Now let them see what was said on the ef-
fect of the joint resolution of 1819 and 1829
'Thus and with all these «olemn foims and sanctions was
consummated the election of Printer, which the Kitchen Cabi
net, in all the insolence of power with matchless presump
tion undertake to older the House of Representatives to set
aside, which they cou'd no more legally do, the reader will
perceive, than they could now set aside the election of Mr
Adams to the Presidency in 1825 and decíale every act done in
consequence of it to have been illegal and void *'
There was the doctrine of the Whig party of
1833, promulgated by tneir accredited organ in
Washington city, and under circumstances less
strong than those now existing, for there was now
no allegation that B air and Rives were chosen by
fraud. Gales and Seaton then declared that it was
a soiemn contract, and that they could be m more
dismissed than that Mr Adams could be di misced
from the Presidency by the vote of Congress, and
yet now they wire to reap the fruit of the act
which they then, m elaborate editorial articles, de-
nounced as illegal and immoral, and, to use their
own language, as an act of "matchless impu-
dence " That was not his language, but the Ian
guage of the guit'emen v¡no were to be tlected
Printers by the other side, who were about to do
the very same act which wai. then pionouneed to
be immorai and illegal, and "matchless impu
dence " This joint resolution had been in force
for twenty-two years, (or the first election of Gales
and Seaton took place on the third of March,
1819 Fo this fact let him call the attention ot
this body and the country, and let him ask if this
body was not now to act on this joint resoluiton
The resolution was acted upon at the following
periods 1819,'21,'23,'25,'27, 29, "31, '33, '35,
'37, '39, and'41
Theie was not one single gap or intermission m
this body from the 31 of March, 1819, to this pe-
ri d There were examp'es in. their favor for twen-
ty-two years, under all the muiduonx of party and
of doctrine that this country had usdergone, and
not one example to the contrary, but at this late
period, this Whig Senate was about to create an
example for the violation of the resolution of 1819
For the fust time, a Whig Senate was about to dis-
miss a Printer appointed nnder that joint resolu-
tion, for never had either House given them one
solitary example, during a period of tv eniy-two
years, to justify the act that was th°n about to be
performed by a Whig majority And what was
the ground on which the resolution had been disre-
garded m the other Housed On looking at the
journals, it would be sjen that they were twofold
One was a dispute in regard to the manner ot the
election—whether it should be by ballot cr viva
voce. They failed not on the ground that the
resolution was inoperative, but on the ground
that it required a. vote of two thirds to take the re
solution up for action, and two-thirds could not be
found to agree upon a day And when the session
was hastening to a clcs , and it was supposed that
an attempt to act upon this resolution would defeat
b ¡Is that were on then pasSog-, and, therefore,
two-thirds could not be found to support it, this
non-action ot the House of Representatives was to
constitute ground for the deymtion of Ihe Senate
irom i's uniform practice 'rom 1819 to 1841' But
the House of Representatives had set them no such
evil example, as that, alter an election had been
consummated, it should be disregarded and set
aside, and the contract rescinded The specified
grounds on which the contract could be set aside,
were a failure to execute the work, or delay in its
execution, and they were not to interpolate on that
contract provision^jhat were not in it It wa,s to
be a contract on one side, as well as on the other.
It was obligatory on Blair and Rives, as one of the
contracting parties, and on the Senate of the United
States as the other, and the only other contracting
party,andyd this Senate, the party entering into this
contract with Blair and Rives, were to be the sole
judges and violaters of that contract—an «sample
for which would not be found in the whole coarse
of jurisprudence, from the commencement of le-
gislation down to this tim . Blair and Rives could
neither resign nor abandon their contract without
the consent of the Senate, nor release themselves
from its obligations, and was it ever heard or
dreamed of, that a contract was btndingon one party
and not on another? This, then, clearly distin-
guished it from all other cases which had been men-
tioned in debate He, therefore, implored the Se-
nate to maintain the good faith and honor of the
country, in which they had so deep an interest, and
not, by toe violation of this contract, set an evil
example to the respective Slates of the Union, to
impair that good faith which should ever be held
inviolate He would rather that some compro-
mise should be effected than that this great principle
should be violated by the Senate of the United
Slates
Mr. MANGUM read various extracts from the
Globe of the same period, maintaining doctrines
directly the reverse of those contended for by the
Intelligencer.
Mr WALKER called the attenlion of the Senate
to the fact that that doctrine was repudiated by the
Democratic party lo which it was directed
But one word more They had designated a
partnership to le the Printers to the Senate, and he
wished lo mqjire wheiher they could elect a part-
nership tj an fru-eí He proposed thit question
for he con idera ion of his friends on the other
side, and ft" wi hed them to thmlc well of it before
they consummated the work which they had now
began Did they eleci Blair and Eiires, or Gales
and Seaton, as they did their Secretary and Ser-
geant-it-arms, to any office known to the law?
And if they had designated two individuals as one,
on whit principle did they dismiss both? This
showed clearly that they were merely designating
contractors, and not eleclirg officers
On the motion of Mr PRESTON, the Senate
then we it into Executive session   \
Thursday, March 11, 1841
The isolation to dismiss Blair and Rives being
under consideration—
Mr BERRIEN resumed the debate, this day,
in support of the resolution The views which he
expressed at some length, were those of previous
speakers The resolution, he said, affirmed two
things- the first was, that the Senate had power to
do the act contemplated by that resolution, and se-
condly, that there «as cause for doing u, and these
involved the po mon that the Senate, as now as
semb'ed, was, invested with us constitutional pow-
ers to elect its own officers, which included the
idea that it had the power also of dismissal. They
were then sitting as a "Senate," the Printer was an
officer of ihe Senate, and partaking of the views
and feeling of the majority of the people by whom
the new Administration had been called in'o office,
their organ of communication with the people, who
was neces^an'y entrusted with most confidential*
eommunicatio i , should not be the editor of a
leading political paper oí that party which had al-
ready announced their determined opposition to the
existing Admimstratun It was "the very error
of the moon" to suppose they could tolerate or
continue these Pi inters one instant beyond the ac-
quisition of ihe power to dismiss them.
Mr BENTON said six years ago the Senate
happened to be engaged m the same business which
now occupied Us atlention He happened to be
in connection with the Senate in 1835, when the
the actual majority of that day, being just about to
go into a minority, proposed to bring on the elec-
tion of Printer for their successors, which was re-
sisted by the minority, who  were  thensoon to be
