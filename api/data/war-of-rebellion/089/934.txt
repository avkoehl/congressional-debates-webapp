Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,December 10, 1864-2.30 p.m. (Sent 2.35 p.m.)

Major-General PARKE:

Colonel Kerwin, of the cavalry, who is going with Potter, will have a battery of horse artillery. You can send this order to the commanding officer of that battery, with direction for him to report to Potter, and accompany his column, should it move before the cavalry join, as they are now coming in from the left and may be delayed. This battery will be found near Gregg's headquarters on the plank road.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,December 10, 1864-6.30 p.m. (Received 6.40 p.m.)

Major-General PARKE:

Colonel Hazard will send the wagons to you. General Wheaton is ordered to move his reserve to his extreme right, near Jerusalem plank road. His headquarters will be at the Jones house. Should you need re-enforcements from him you must send staff officers to conduct them, since he knows nothing whatever of the roads, intrenchments on his right, &amp;c.
