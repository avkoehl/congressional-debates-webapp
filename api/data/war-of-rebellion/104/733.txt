HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Macon, Ga., May 12, 1865 - 11 a. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The following dispatch, announcing capture of Jeff. Davis, has just been handed me by Colonel Minty, commanding the Second Division.*

The First Wisconsin belongs to La Grange's brigade, of McCook's division, and had been sent due east by General Croxton, via Dublin. Colonel Minty had distributed his command all along the south bank of the Ocmulgee and Altamaha. This accounts for the collision between parts of the First and Second Divisions, and shows the zeal of the officers and men in pursuit. I have directed increased vigilance on the part of the command, in the hope of catching the other assassins. Our dispositions are good, and so far none of the rebel chiefs have been able to get through. Breckinridge's son was captured night before last eleven miles south of here. I will send further details as soon as received.

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.

(Same to Generals Grant and Thomas).

MACON, GA., [May] 12, 1865 - 2 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

LA GRANGE, GA., May 10, 1865.

General WILSON,

Macon:

GENERAL: I have just seen a proclamation by the President of the United States offering a reward of $ 100,000 for my arrest on a charge of having, with others therein named, incited and concocted the murder of the late President. Conscious of my innocence, unwilling even to seem to fly from justice, and confident of my entire vindication from so foul an imputation upon a full, fair, and impartial trial, which I expect to receive, I shall go as soon as practicable to Macon to deliver myself up to your custody.

I am, respectfully,

C. C. CLAY, JR.

I shall detain him here until the arrival of Jeff. Davis.

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
