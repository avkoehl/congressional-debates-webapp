Rear-Admiral D. G. FARRAGUT,

Commanding W. G. B. Squadron, off Mobile, Ala.:

ADMIRAL: General Granger, with 1,500 infantry, two light and two heavy batteries, and a battalion of engineer troops, in all 2,400 men, is embarking to-day. We have much difficulty about transportation. Two of the steamers intended for the expedition have broken down and I have been obliged to substitute a heavy sea-going steamer, which will involve the trouble and delay of lightering. The rebels appear to be concentrating in considerable force on the west back of the Atchafalaya; their object is not yet developed. No troops have yet arrived from Texas, but I am looking for them daily.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General.
