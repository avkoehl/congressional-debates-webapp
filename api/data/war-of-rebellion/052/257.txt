HEADQUARTERS SECOND BRIGADE,August 31, 1863.

Captain M. P. BESTOW,

A. A. G., First Division, Twenty-first Army Corps:

SIR: Nothing of importance has taken place since my last note, observable from here. The only change in the camp of the rebels is, they have a force again at the same place that was occupied by Bate's brigade, reported by deserters to have left by railroad on Friday. There was also a dense smoke seen yesterday in the neighborhood of Ringgold on the Atlanta railroad,. There is, no doubt, a camp there. Has not been there before. Have prisoner captured by scouts near Kelley's Ferry. Is a very intelligent man; looks like an officer. Claims only to be a private. Belongs to the Third Confederate Regiment. Is from Mississippi. Says his wife is staying at her father's, near Dunlap. He claims to belong to the quartermaster's department. Has also been a scout, from his account. He is very likely an accomplished spy. He says his regiment is patrolling the river from Kelley's Ferry to Guntersville. That Wharton's division, to which he belongs, is a short distance south of the river on the enemy's left flank. He says that the only fear they have of this army is that it will cross the river below and cut the railroad; in that event, compelling Bragg to retreat again as at Tullahoma. But the general can probably get this from himself, as I shall send him down with return train. Keep a watch on him or he will escape.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

G. D. WAGNER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
