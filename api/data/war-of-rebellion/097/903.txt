HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON,April 22, 1865.

Commander PARKER, U. S. Navy,

Saint Indigoes, Md.:

there is reason to believe that Booth and an accomplice are in the swamps about Allen's fresh, emptying into Wicomico River. He is evidently trying to cross into Virginia. Have you the Potomac well guarded about there and above? Fearing he may have already crossed, I wish to send a force of cavalry to Nomini Bay. Can I land horses there or in that vicinity, and with how much water? Please inform me at once.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON,April 22, 1865.

Commander PARKER, U. S. Navy,

Saint Indigoes, Md.:

There is no longer any doubt that Booth and an accomplice were near Bryantown on Saturday last, inquiring for Piney Church. He is very lame, having broken his leg, and was last seen on crutches. He was undoubtedly endeavoring to cross into Virginia. I am desires to request your most vigilant co-operation, by a rapid and active blockade of all the Potomac, to prevent his escape into Virginia. Will you please communicate this information to the tugs and other quartermasters' boats on duty guarding the river and enjoin the greatest activity and watchfulness upon them?

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.

SAINT INDIGOES, April 22, 1865.

(Received 6.50 p. m.)

Major-General AUGUR:

Telegrams received. There is no wharf in Nomini Bay, but there is a good landing in Coan River with eight feet of water about fifteen miles below, where cavalry can disembark very readily, I have dispatched a boat to communicate the information contained in your telegrams of this date to the vessels in the Potomac.

S. NICKERSON,

Acting Volunteer Lieutenant, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON,April 22, 1865.

Commander PARKER, U. S. Navy,

Saint Indigoes:

The cavalry are directed to land at Coan River, as you suggest. Can you send a gun-boat to show them the landing and assist them generally? They will leave here about 9 this evening.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.
