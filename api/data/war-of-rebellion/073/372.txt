and was ordered to assume command of the brigade and reform it, which duty I discharged and then urgently asked General Butterfield for permission to take it again to the works we had carried and still held, and bring off the guns we had captured. This was refused, and by his order the brigade was placed in a new position on a hill to the left of the point at which we had assaulted, to assist in repelling an attack made by the enemy. To sum up the account of the day's fight, I will add that detachments from my regiment, and, I believe, from each of the other regiments of the brigade, held the rebels from re-entering and taking the guns we had captured until they were brought off at night by a detail from the First and Second Brigades. I would respectfully call your attention to the following points: First, my regiment entered the enemy's works in advance of all others, and my colors, though not planted, were the first to enter the fort; second, the enemy's were not penetrated at any other point than that where we entered, although assaulted by other troops on the left; third, my regiment, being in advance and having to bear the burnt of the assault, accomplished all that could bee required of them in entering the works and driving the enemy out. The work of carrying a second line of defense belonged to the support which followed me. The day following the battle my regiment, together with our whole brigade, remained on the battle-field burying our own and the rebel dead,and collecting abandoned arms and other property. Leaving the battle-ground about 5 p.m. of the 16th, we rejoined the division at ---- Mill. In the engagement with the enemy near Cassville on the 19th instant my regiment was under quite a heavy fire of shell, but suffered no loss. I append a list of killed and wounded in my regiment.*

I desire, in conclusion, to acknowledge the gallantry of my officers and men. Though never before under fire they have the testimony of the veteran foe they overcame that they bore themselves with conspicuous courage. I could not, of course, observe every individual act of gallantry on the part of my company officers, but must commend to your notice the following as especially worthy of mention for their determined and successful efforts to hold the captured guns: Captain William M. Meredith, Captain H. M. Scott, Lieutenant M. L. Ohr, Captain P. S. Carson, Captain H. M. Endsley, Lieutenant William C. Mitchell, Lieutenant E. B. Colestock. Captain Tansey, who was severely wounded,also bore himself most gallantly. Lieutenant C. H. Cox, acting adjutant, was conspicuous for his coolness and his efforts to rally the men. Lieutenant-Colonel Merrill and Major Ragan did their whole duty,and have need of no higher praise from me. Dr. Jenkins A. Fitzgerald,assistant surgeon, during all of our series of operations was always found with his regiment, dressing the wounds of those who had fallen under the heaviest fire of the enemy, manifesting a through disregard of his own safety in his humane desire to give the wounded the promptest surgical relief. Rev. A. C. Allen, chaplain, deserves mention for his untiring labors night and day to relieve the wants and sufferings of our wounded.

I am,general, with the greatest respect, you obedient servant,

BENJA. HARRISON,

Colonel Seventieth Indiana Volunteer Infantry.

Brigadier General W. T. WARD,

Commanding First Brigadier, Third Div., 20th Army Corps.
