CAPTAIN: The First Ohio is back, and should be near Gaylesville. It was left on picket ata Gover's Gap. It is a small regiment and has no ammunition, and I can get none of rits carbines. I have detailed this regiment for couriers to General Sherman, and it should be on hand early to-day. I have not heard from it, but think it must be near Gaylesville.
