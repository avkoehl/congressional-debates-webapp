CHARLESTON, January 30, 1865.

General S. COOPER:

The following dispatch has just been received from Major General D. H. HILL, Augusta:

Nine hundred men from the West have arrived; one-half deserted.

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE GEORGIA,January 30, 1865.

Lieutenant-General HARDEE:

GENERAL: Iverson's scouts think that the Yankee force which came up on this side and supposed to be the Fourteenth Army Corps has all crossed at Sister's Ferry. I don't know his scouts and how reliable they may be. The troops are coming in very slowly. How happens it that whenever there is an emergency for the movement of troops there is something wrong with railroads? Is it because superintendents and employes are nearly all Yankees? So I think. The troops arriving are destitue of everything-arms, clothing, &amp;c. Nine hundred arr4ived out of 1,600 started; the rest deserted.

I send your order of Sherman. What action should be taken in the premises? An ordnance officer and inspector-general are much needed.

Respectfully,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF GEORGIA,[January 30, 1865.]

General G. W. SMITH,

Godwyn's Bridge:

GENERAL: General Deas, with 900 men, is at Green's Cut. He has been directed to report to you. As he is without transportation he will have to be kept near the railroad, and so with all the troops sent down. It will be necessary to send out scouts to the river to watch a crossing above you. Mathew's Bluff is the lowest point occupied by terday. I wish you would inquire of Iverson whether the ferr- boat at Hudson's Ferry has been destroyed. The negro force ought to be guarded. They are deserting rapidly. The troops also to be put to work.

Very respectfully,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.
