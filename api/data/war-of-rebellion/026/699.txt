Lieutenant-Commander Babcock, in the Morse, accompanied by the Mystic, is instructed to inform you by 10 a. m. to-morrow of his readiness to accompany the troops to York River, where he will report to Lieutenant-Commander Gillis.

FORT MONROE, VA.,

May 5, 1863-10.30 a. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have just received the following from General Peck. I am going to Suffolk to send off the expedition referred to heretofore:

Major Stratton's information, from entirely reliable sources, Union and rebel, is that Longstreet had over 30,000 before he was joined by any of Hill's forces. The enemy had three entire lines of works where we were on Sunday, and could not have been carried.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, VA., May 5, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

During the investment of Longstreet's and Hill's forces we have captured five pieces of artillery, about 400 prisoners, much camp equipage, and some rifles. Not less than 400 or 500 have deserted from the rebels; probably his loss in killed and wounded is about 600, making his total loss about 1,500.

Our killed is 34; wounded, 201; and missing, 14. Total, 249.*

All the morale, prestige, glory, and victory of the twenty-three days belong to our patient and brave men. Besides, they have held the masses of the enemy around Suffolk, in order to enable General Hooker to secure a crowning victory for the Union, and are entitled to a share of the glory that may accrue to his arms.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, May 5, 1863.

Major-General PECK:

I am just leaving for Suffolk.

General HALLECK,

Commander-in-Chief U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: There are several contingencies likely to occur in the affairs of this department which should I think be brought to your notice more fully than I have or can in fact do in correspondence. I would like
