I hope to see you very soon down here. I do not believe the court will give you much trouble.

Please excuse me for writing unofficially on business matters.

I am, general, sincerely yours,

SMITHFIELD POST-OFFICE,

Polk County, Tex., August 31, 1863.

Captain EDMUND P. TURNER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I have the honor to report that immediately on receiving your order of the 7th instant to furnish information with a view to the location of iron-works on Trinity River, I addressed letters to gentlemen in the iron region of the highest character and intelligence and long residence in our State, thinking it better to rely on their combined information, acquired through a series of years, than on the doubtful and unsatisfactory results of such an examination as I would have been able to make in person. Their replies have begun to reach me; and as I have already received enough to establish the material facts, I think it better to report at once, under the possibility of General [Benjamin]
