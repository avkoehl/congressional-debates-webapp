Major General U. S. GRANT:

As directed by Colonel Dickney, chief of cavalry, I reported myself in command of the cavalry division, with headquarters at this place. The information I get is that the mass of the rebel army is at Grenada. An outpost of cavalry at Torrance Station; strength about 1,200. The rest of the cavalry are at Stratham's, on Yalabusha. No infantry north of Grenada. Pickets 3 miles south of Coffeeville, with occasional patrols in Coffeville. I am guarding railroad bridge at this place and the crossings of the Otuckalofa. Let the Sixth Illinois Cavalry come up, if possible.
