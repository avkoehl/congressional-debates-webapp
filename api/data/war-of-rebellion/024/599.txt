Captain Morton with one gun, supported by Cox's battalion, and on the right by Colonel Napier's battalion and Colonel Starnes with his regiment, and General Forrest with Russell's Fourth Alabama, Biffle's Ninth [Nineteenth] Tennessee, and [T. G.] Woodward's Kentucky battalion got in their rear, and then they fled in confusion, leaving all their dead and wounded and six pieces of artillery in our possession. The enemy retreated in the timber and halted to reform. We had about 300 prisoners, and while we were parlaying about a surrender the enemy was re-enforced by General Sullivan with another brigade of infantry, which was firing upon our horse-holders before we were aware of his approach. General Forrest then ordered us to retreat, which we did in much confusion, as our horse-holders were demoralized and many men were captured in trying to get their horses. We retreated through the large cotton field between a fire from the re-enforcements and the brigade we had just driven back.

In this battle the regiment lost 4 killed, 27 wounded, and 122 captured; also lost 130 horses.

Early in the morning of January 1, 1863, we were met by Colonel [William K. M.] Breckenridge's regiment United States cavalry, who was between us and the Tennessee River. After skirmishing a few minutes we charged and routed them, killing and capturing 15 or 20 of them. We then marched to the Tennessee River, found our wood-boats,left in charge of Captain [J. M.] Barnes, [Company H], and Lieutenant-Colonel [F. H.] Daugherty, of the Eighth [Tennessee], all safe, and we crossed the Tennessee River, the forces under General [Jeremiah C.] Sullivan, appearing on the opposite bank on the 3d.

Our total loss during the expedition was 8 killed, 35 wounded, and 130 captured or missing.

Very respectfully,

G. G. DIBRELL,

Colonel Eight Tennessee Cavalry.
