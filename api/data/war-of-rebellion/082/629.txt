Lieutenant Colonel E. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Tenth Army Corps:

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the dispatch of july 28 from the major-general commanding Tenth Army Corps, in answer to my request for instructions. The only instructions that I received were previous to the expedition, and from Major-General Butler, to the effect that I was to cross and hold this position at all hazards until the bridge was completed, after which time I was to repel force by force, keeping headquarters well informed of what transpired. I was told verbally that such re-enforcements as were deemed necessary to hold the position would be sent me.

I am, colonel, respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
