Question. When you started from General Pope with the order, did you know, and, if so, how did you know, where to find the accused?

Answer. I did not know exactly where I would find him. I was directed to go to a place which, if I had gone to it, would have brought me 2 or 3 miles in advance of General Porter.

Question. Who gave you that direction?

Answer. It was Colonel Ruggles. He pointed in the direction; he did not tell me any certain place to go to.

Question. You refer to Colonel Ruggles, of General Pope's staff?

Answer. He was then chief of General Popes' staff.

Question. What induced you to take a different direction from the one pointed out by Colonel Ruggles?

Answer. I could find no road to go directly to the place I was directed to without going through the woods, and I was afraid I could not find the place the; so I took this road, as my orderly had directed. He said that we could go as far as the railroad there, and we might meet some of General Porter's troops.

Answer. I do not think I met any until I first met General Porter.

Question. by what information were you enabled, not having the actual position of General Porter, to find him?

Answer. I inquired at the railroad. When I got to the railroad, I saw some stragglers, and I inquired if they knew anything about General Porter. It was an officer I inquired of. He said that General Porter was right straight ahead, on the other side of the railroad.

Question. What information had you that enabled you, upon leaving General Pope, to go int he exact direction, which you think you traveled, so as to strike the railroad at the point at which, or near which, you found the accused?

Answer. I was directed by my orderly that that road led across the railroad.
