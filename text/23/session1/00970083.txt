THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr STEWART, of Pennsylvania, thought, he
said, we had sub ects of_exutement enough beiore
us without the addition of this Its introduction
into the House at this time would hasten the col-
lision which the gentleman deprecates, by agitating
the citizens rf Alai ama He saw no cause for
the intervention of Congress in the case, and theie
was certain'y no occasion for any action on the
subject before the 15 h                                           %
Mr LEWIS saiu if anything was to be done, it
must be done quickly I he ordei for removal was
unrevoked, and would be executed by military
force on the 15th of this month It was a question
of peace oi war
Mr   JONES, of Georgia, said, of what  use
would be the action ot this House after the 15 h >
That is the time when the mischief is to be done,   1
when the orders of the Executive are to be en-
forced     The gentleman from Pennsylvania says ,|
there is  no cause for the interposition  of Con- I
giess     If the thieatened lemoval ot people from
lands to which they nave been invited, and if tne
subjection of the country to military law be not
cause for intervention in a  fiee Government, he ||
knew not what could be     Last year instructions I
were sent to the marshal of A'abama to remove i
all persons agai ist whom any Indian had made a '
complaint     Fnere were always some individuals
who, from interested motives, would induce  the
Indians to complain of him     He knew the fact
that immediately afiei the mmder of Owens, the
land which he had occupied was taken possession
of by another white man     Owens was killed that |
another white  man m ght possess his impiove-
ments     The State of Alabama extended us laws
over the Indians and Indian lands within its limits
Now the ai chives of the Government would show
that tiny law in contravention of the jUMsdiction
of the ¿tales over Indians and Indian lands was I
h ld  by the Piesident and Secretaiv of Wir as
null and void     The laws of Alabama weie in full
operation over the district of country occupied by
the Indians     Tins was a'so a sufficient ct-use foi
the intervention of Congress in this case     Mr J
read  a  number of documents showing 'hat the
President disclaimed the  right  of ariestmg  the
Hws ot any State withm the limits of that State^
and that tin  House had sanctioned the President's
Views on the subject by appropnatn g laige sums
for the removal of the Indians, according to the
recommendation of the Executive     Ttie opinion
of the Attorney General, that the law of 1807 au-
thorized the removal, was, in his opinion, tncor- '
lecv     It might apply to public property in a Ter-   i
litory, but not in a State     But in this case the
action ot the Government was upon the reserva- !
tions of Indians, which were individual property
Where was ihed ffeience between propeityowned
by a white cit zen and an Ind an, and why should
the summary Government piocess apply to one
and not to another'    The gentleman from A'a
Lama had icms-rked that the Piesident was impa-
tient of tne law's deli y    would  to G id he were
equally so of the insc'ence of office     If he were,
he would not sulject  tree citizens to  the aibi
tiary decisions of a deputy riaishal     It was in
tie knowledge of eveiy one heie that one man had
been killed in Alabama     It was also true thit the
marshal and his assis ants had  been indicted for
mmder, and  true b lis had   been found against
them     Suppose they aie condemned, and suppose
a utation is issued to carry up the case, by appeal,
to the Federal couits     Suppose the citation is no.
attended to by the State couits, and that the mur-
deieis are hung, as Tissels was in Geoi° a—will
not such a conflict of jurisdiction piesent a case
for the intervention of Congiess >
Mi McKIJNLEY was not \ íepaied (hes-ud) to
vote for this resoutnn It appealed extiaoidi
naiy 'o him that the action of the Mouse snould
be asked on a state of things on the 7th of Jan
uaiy which would not ocoui tdl the 15 h of Jan-
uary ! he subject was impoitant, and deserved
some further inqjuy As it .vas near the usi al
horn of adjourning, he now moved that the House
udjourn                                                                          I
The motion to adjourn was lost                             [
Mr  McTClNLI\ moved to lay the resolution
on the table till to morrow, but withdrew it, and
moved to postpone its mrther consideration till to-
moirow
Mi FOSTER, íemarked that this motion would '
have the effect to defer the «moderation of the
resolution for two mo ths, until the debate on the
deposite question was over

noes were ordered on the motion
The question being taken, the motion was de-
