headquarters, but does not report. Hancock has been urged to push forward with dispatch and guides sent him. I think his advance will be at Cold Harbor early in the morning, say by 6 a. m. Warrent does not seem to have effected anything in his front, except repulsing attacks made on him. He should, however, be ordered to attack in conjunction with the others. Burnside I would hold ready to re-enforce Warren, if necessary.

Respectfully, yours,

GEO. G. MEADE

Major-General.
