I did this for a better supply of water and forage, and also to reconnoiter on the Manchester line in case thy should be inclined to trouble my left and rear from that region, not far from which they generally make raids from Western Virginia. The above for your information. All my columns concentrated at Flat Lick in the same hour.

BARBOURSVILLE, KY., September 7, 1863.

Brigadier-General POTTER:

My sick are filling the houses in my rear, and I have no surgeons or medicines to leave with them. Dr. Wilson can inform you that I foretold this and some of the other disasters which must take place on this line of operations unless commissary, quartermaster's, and medical departments work in a different fashion from what they are now doing.

CUMBERLAND FORD, September 7, 1863.

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
