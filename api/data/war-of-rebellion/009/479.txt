His Excellency HENRY T. CLARK,Governor of North Carolina, Raleigh, N. C.:

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that Brigadier General J. G. Martin has been assigned to the immediate command of the troops in the State of North Carolina. It is hoped and believed that his position as an officer of the Confederate States Army will in no way interfere with the discharge of the duties devolving upon him in his capacity as Adjutant and Inspector General of the State, and that under his immediate supervision the troops in the State will reach a high degree of efficiency and nothing be neglected which can advance and protect the interests of North Carolina. I have desired that he will render such aid as he can toward collecting and enrolling the men liable to military duty, so that the regiments from the State may be speedily and fully recruited.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, August 12, 1862.

Brigadier General J. G. MARTIN,Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I am informed by the Adjutant and Inspector General that your resignation has not been accept, and that you have been directed to report to me for duty. You will report for further orders to Major General D. H. Hill, commanding the Department of North Carolina. I trust you will be enabled to perform the duties, devolving upon you as an officer of the State as well as of the Confederate States. I particularly desire that you will render such assistance as may being your power, as commanding officer of the Confederate troops in the State, toward collecting and enrolling the men liable to military duty under the act of Congress of April 16, 1862, as it is all important that the ranks of the regiments so reduced by sickness and battle shall be filled. After the old regiments have been recruited the surplus men should be collected in camps of instruction and there organized and prepared for service in the field.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
