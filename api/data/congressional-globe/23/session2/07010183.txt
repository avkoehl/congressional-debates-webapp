THE GLOBE----MR. CALHOUN.
Mr C4LH0UN arose, holding in his hand a
copv of the Globe newspaper, and desired that
the Secretary of the Senate should be required to
read a paragraph which he (Mr. C )refeired to.
The following paragraph from the Globe was
then read.
" We were informed bvMr Wilson, the keeper
' of the Roturdo, that he had frequently observed
' this man about the Capitol—sofiequently that he
'had become an object of curiosity to him, that he
' had endeavoied to draw him into conversation,
' but found him taciturn and unwilling to talk.
' Whether Lawrence ha1? caught, m his vis.ts to
'the Capito1, the mania which has prevailed
' during the two lastsess.ons in the Senate, wheth-
' er he has become infatuated with the chimeras
' whicn have troubled thebrainsot thedisa| pointed
'and ambitious oiaiors who have deputed the
' President as a Caisar who ought to have a Bru-
'tus, as aCromwell,aNero,a Tiberius, we know
' not If no seo et con*pu ¡icy has pi ompted the ptipe-
' Iralwn of the homd deed, we think it not lraprob-
' able that some delusion of intellect has grown
' out of his visits to the Capitol, and 'hat hearing
'despotism, and every horrible mischief threat-
' ered to the Republic, and revolution and all its
' train of calamities imputed as the necessary con-
' seqaence of the President's measures, it may be
' that the infatuated man fancied he had reason to
' become h.s country's avenger if he had heard
'and beaeved Mr Calhoun's speech the day be-
' fore yesterday, he would have found in it ample
'ju tfication for /its attempt on one who was repre-
sented as the cause of the most dreadful calami-
' ties to the naaon, as one who made peifect rot-
' tenness and corruption to pervade the vitals of
' the Government, insomuch that it was scarcely
' worth pieservmg, if it were oossible "
Mr C said that he rose to make afewremarks
on the'aitide which had just been read—not in
reference to himself, but on Us political bearing and
character
There are some things of themselves so insig-
nificant as to be undeeeivmg of notice, but which,
in connexion with others, may become important
Such vas the piesert Whatevei may be the
chaiacter of the paper which contains the aiticle,
lo.vevei base and prostitute, it is the known,
authenl'c, and es abiished organ of the Executive,
sus amed by -'s power, and pampered by its
hands
In noticing the article, I pass by the base insin-
uation that  it contains, and will confine my re-
maiks to the new pnncip'es in ethics and politics
winch it asserts     What this principle is, no one
who i-ead the article can douot     It asserts that he
who denounces abuses and con up ior, be they
evei soe.eat, instigatesassassma ion '   And what
description of denunciation is considered as Justi-
fying an assassination is not left to doubt     As if
to remove all unceitainty on this point the article
refers to my remarks the other day     I allude not
to this reference, with a view of defending myself,
foi I require no defence, but for lllustiatmg the
|   new code of political  morals announced tinough
the Execu'ive oigan      It asserts that had he who
has attempted the life of the C! lef Magistrate
been present and heaidwhat I said, he would have
been justiji'd in doing what he attempted, and of
I   course, if I had made such declaiatioiis  vclutuaiily
1   as wou'd have jus'ijied the attempt, the inference
|   would follow that 1 was the instigator of the crime
Now, (said   Mr   C ,) what were the circum-
1  stances of the case'   The Post Office report was
under consideration     It had made extraordinary-
disclosures of abuses and corruption m that branch
of the Administration, abuses and corruption con-
ceded, acknowledged, and denied  by none, not
even the supporters of the Administration   1 hese
I denounced, and at the same time expressed my
conviden that abuses and corruption weie not
limited to that particular bianeh, but extended to
I  almost every depaitmeit of the Administration,
<  but which I a'tnbuted moie to the working of the
political machine at this time than to the miscon-
duct of those who administer the Government, as
