HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIFTH ARMY CORPS,February 23, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel E. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I request that the general commanding may issue an order sending Bvt. Brigadier General C. S. Russell to his regiment at City Point. He is not assigned to duty according to his brevet rank by the President, and therefore one of his colonels rank him. I would request that General Luddlow be sent there to command his brigade.

Major-General.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

A refugee from Greensborough, N. C., states that regiments and companies have passed south through Greensborough for the last month; didn't know the number. There is a large amount of grain stored at Greensborough. Wagon shops there turn out a dozen wagons a day. The man is an escaped conscript.

I. VOGDES,

Brigadier-General.

WINCHESTER, February 23, 1865.

(Received 6 p. m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I have telegraphed General Augur in reference to the Northern Neck. There is also in Essex and King and Queen Counties, and, in fact, in the section of country from Bowling Green down to Urbana, between the Rappahannock and Mattapony Rivers, a large amount of provisions and forage. Last summer, when I was in this section, I found the finest crops of corn I ever say, and every acre was planted. I think some supplies are being gathered west of the Shenandoah Valley, in the little mountain valleys from Warm Springs to Pearing, on New River. Rosser's brigade of cavalry, also Imboden, Jackson, and McCausland, are in the above-named section. It has been raining here for the last twelve hours; the snow is going fast.
