Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Will you accept three battalions of light cavalry of four companies each, making a regiment in all, for service during the war? Most of the companies would desire to furnish their own horses, and it is thought that the organization can be completed in twenty days or less. Such a force is much needed for service on our in Kentucky, and also in Tennessee.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor of Indiana.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., September 13, 1862.

Governor MORTON,

Indiapanolis:

The Department would accept the three battalions of cavalry mentioned in your telegram. The horses would be received upon passing inspection at an appraisement by the Quartermaster's Department. It has proved a bad arrangement for cavalry to own their own horses; they do no work, and are apt to take an early start.
