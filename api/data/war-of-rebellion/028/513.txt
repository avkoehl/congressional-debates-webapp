HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, October 30, 1862-8.40 p. m.

General WILLIAM LB. FRANKLIN,Hagerstown, Md.:

Your dispatch of 1.30 p. m. received. A regiment will be ordered from Sharpsburg to relieve yours at Hagerstown. Colonel Ingalls will send orders to Captain Weeks to turn over for General Brooks' artillery the 46 horses. They are expected to be at Hagerstown to-morrow. General Brooks can leave some men at Hagerstown, to follow with the horses. Please direct General Averell to have two squadrons of his cavalry to report to General Kenly for duty. When the order was given for Colonel Davis' regiment to report to Kenly, it was supposed that he was at Hagerstown. The two squadrons to be left by Averell will probably be sufficient, with what General Kenly now has. Please order your brigades to join you here a s soon as General Kenly gets his command in position.

Chief of Staff.
