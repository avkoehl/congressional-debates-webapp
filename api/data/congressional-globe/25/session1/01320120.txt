remonstrating- against the annexation of Texas,
which were ordered to lie on table
Mr ALLEN presented a preamble and twenty-
four resolutions, passed at a meeting of the citizens
of Hamilton cennty, Oho Mr A. said Hamilton
county was known as the most populous and
wealthy county in the State, and the paper was
signed by the most respectable individuals, the
views set forth were chiefly in accordance with the
views of the Message, as set forth by the President;
he moved that the paper be laid on the table, and
printed, which was agreed to
A resolution giving to Wisconsin Territory cer-
tain public documents, was taken up and dis-
cussed, and afterwards laid on the table.
A message was received from the House of Re-
presentatives, stating that it had passed a bill
aulhonzmg the issuing of Treasuty notes
Mr. WRIGHT explained «herein this bill dif-
fered from the one emanating from the Senate.
This bill, after being read twice, was referred to
the Committee on Finance.
The bill regulating the fees of district attorneys
in the íenewal of merchants' bonds, received a third
reading, and was finally passed.   It now reads
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Represen-
tatives of fie United States of ¿¡met ica, in Congress
assembled, That in all cases of extension of the time
of payment of bonds given for duties on imports,
it shall be according to such directions as may be
given by the Secreiary of the Treasury, and the
extension of payment of the old bond, or the taking
of a new bond, shall be by the respective collectors
subject to no other charge than such as may be
legally receivable on the taking of the original
bond upon the entry of merchandise.
Sec. 2. And be it further enacted, That no fee
shall accrue to any district attorney on any bond
left with him for collection, or m a suit commenced
on any bond for the renewal of which provision is
made by law, unless the party or parties shall
neglect to apply for such renewal for more than
twenty days after the matuntv of sush bond
Mr. WRIGHT then moved to take up the bill
authorizing the deposite of merchandise in ware-
houses, and for other purposes
Mr CALHOUN made a few remarks in relation
to his disposition to adhere strictly to the compro-
m se act, and, so far as there wa« nothing m the
btll to counteract that measure, it should receive
his support It was a measure intended for the re-
lief of the eommeiwal interests, and by the amend-
ment which he would offer as a proviso to the first
section, the interest which he represented he thought
would not be compromised He would, therefore,
move to insert as a proviso to the first section the
following-
"Provided always, that m all cases where, by
the existing laws, credits are allowed for duties, and
bonds to secure the payments of the same are re-
ceivable by the collectors of the customs, it shall
be at the option of the importer, his factor, agent,
or consignee, until the first day of July, 1842, to
place the goods upon which such duties are charge-
able, in store, pursuant to the provisions of this act,
or to give the bonds for the duties allowed by the
existing laws, and for the periods of time provid-
ed form those laws, but the election shall m all
cases be made at the time of importation, and be-
fore the goods have been placed in the store, as
allowed by this, or any other existing law "
Mr WRIGHT said he presumed there would
now be no objection, as the bill m that shape would
not conflict with the contending interests
Mr. CLAY thought the amendment more objec-
tionable than the original bill; it now left with the
importer the option tolandhis goods, and warehouse
them, and remove them at his pleasure fiom place
to place, taking advantage of all the markets, fiom
New Yoik to Philadelphia, Baltimore or Boston.
The privileges to the importer were too great.
Mr C thought it better to let the whole matter lie
over until the next session, and moved postpone-
ment until the first Mouday m December next.
Mr. NILLS made some remarks as lo the im-
propriety of stimulating the commercial business
to excess, which the credit s} stem has ihe means
of doing.
Mr WEBSTER thought it better not to commit
themselves by a vote on the bill, he believed it
would be better to postpone it, as some of the fea-
tures in his estimation might expose the revenue to
danger
Mr KNIGHT, also wished the subject post-
poned, as the bill in its present shape might have a
tendency to disturb the markets.
Mr. WRIGHT asked for the yeas and nays on
the question to postpone, when there appeared—foi
it 17, against it 22, as follows
