FORT MONROE, July 11, 1864.

Hon. GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy:

Operator at Cherrystone says he saw yesterday department orders to send three gun-boats to Washington. Steam-tug bringing it from Cherrystone has mysteriously disappeared. Will send Vicksburg and Morse to Washington, Emma to Annapolis, Cuyler to Point Lookout until Minnesota can clear her moorings foul of other anchors.

(Received 11.25 a.m.)

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

Your dispatch just received. Reports have been made to you at 9 a.m. and 7 p.m. every day since I have been here. On my arrival I found here the gun-boats William Bacon, five guns; Currituck, five guns; in all,eight long 32s, one 12-pounder (rifle), one 24-pounder (rifle). On the receipt of your dispatches there were added the Fuchsia, five guns, and the Resolute. Yesterday the Currituck, Resolute, and Fuchsia were ordered up the bay. Other vessels are to be ordered here to-day. The transfer of prisoners to New York is diminishing the fore here in consequence of the guards necessary to accompany them. Three guards of seventy-five each have already been sent. The trimonthly report sent to General Augur yesterday exhibits the strength of the command here. Is your direction to report twice a day to be understood as additional to those regularly made heretofore?

JAMES BARNES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding District.
