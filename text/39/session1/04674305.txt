1866.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

provision the fate of the Union men in all the
ten of the eleven States will be deplorable. I
rejoice that Tennessee has provided against such
horrors, and that she has a Governor with en-
ergy to enforce it. Those temporarily excluded
from the elective franchise by the sixth section
are excluded because they have committed the
highest felony. They may thank the tender
mercy of Congress that the punishment is so
light. Had they been left to Andrew Johnson
"as he was" they would have mounted the
block or fled to foreign climes.
The balance of the bill provides for the ad-
mission of Tennessee, which deserves special
favor as the birth-place or residence of one of
the most extraordinary men in his time that
has ever appeared on earth. I do not pretend
that she is loyal. I believe this day that two
thirds of her people are rank and cruel rebels.
But her statesmen have been wise and vigilant
enough to form a constitution which bridles
licentious traitors and secures the State gov-
ernment to the true men. And she has an Ex-
ecutive fit to ride upon the whirlwind. I know
that two thirds of the congressional districts
will send us secessionists, which will greatly
impair our two-third votes. But she has two or
three men in her delegation who would have
saved Sodom. Ih the Senate, at least, one man
deserves the favor of Congress. Of the other
I say nothing, as I know nothing, and I would
not do injustice to one who has never done in-
jury to me, or, as far as I know, to the country.
I have done in this matter what I deemed
best for humanity. It may be thought I am
showing too much anxiety onaquestionin which
I can have no separate personal interest. I
know it is easy to protect the interests of the
rich and powerful; but it is a great labor to
guard the rights of the poor and downtrodden ;
it is the eternal labor of Sisyphus forever to be
renewed. I know how unprofitable is all such
toil. But he who is in earnest does not heed
these things. I know, too, what effect it has
on personal popularity. But if I may be in-
dulged in a little egotism, I will say that if
there be anything for which I have entire in-
difference, perhaps I may say contempt, it is
that public opinion which is founded on popu-
lar clamor.
In this, perhaps my final action on this great
question, upon a careful review, I can see noth-
ing in my political course, especially in regard
to human freedom, which I could wish to have
expunged or changed. I believe that we must
all account hereafter for deeds done in the body,
and that political deeds will be among those
accounts. I desire to take to the bar of that
final settlement the record which I shall this day
make on the great question of human rights.
While I am sure it will not make atonement for
half my errors, I hope it will be some palliation.
Are there any who will venture to take the
list, with their negative seal upon it, and will
dare to unroll it before that stern Judge who
is the Father of the immortal beings whom they
have been trampling under foot, and whose
souls they have been crushing out?
