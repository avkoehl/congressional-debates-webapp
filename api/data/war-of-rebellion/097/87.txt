Lookout safely, notwithstanding the furious gale that came on soon after you started. It did a great deal of damage here, blowing up trees, unroofing houses; wrecked a vessel at the wharf; killed a hackman and his team in the street, upon whom a roof fell. No news from any quarter has come in to day, except a report of Hancock showing much more force in his department laying around loose than was before known. This will be sent to General Grant. Please let me hear from you at Point Lookout and how you and Mrs. Lincoln stand the voyage.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

General Sheridan makes requisition for 3,000 cavalry horses, to be sent to him immediately. Only about 600 on hand, and to fill this requisition no more can be sent for some time to Armies of the Potomac and James. Shall this be done?

CITY POINT, VA., March 23, 1865-4.30 p. m.

Brigadier General D. H. RUCKER,

Chief Quartermaster:

Please notify me of the number of cavalry horses which you may ship here between this and sunday next. General Grant wishes to give General Sheridan as many as possible-say, 2,000-by Monday, on his arrival. The artillery horses and mules, though much needed, can follow after the cavalry.
