Lieutenant-Colonel [W. N.] BROWN, Comdg., Brandon:

You will report to me as soon as possible with your command. I want you to take command of cavalry.

JACKSON, April 28, 1863.

Major M. R. CLARK, Brookhaven:

The enemy may possibly pay you a visit. Their principal object will, perhaps, be to parole prisoners. It will be well in that event to send all the men you cannot arm to the country, if only a few miles.

J. C. PEMBERTON.
