BROOK'S HEADQUARTERS,

July 9, 1864.

General WEITZEL:

The engineers promised by you to build a wharf at Jones' Landing did not report. It is very necessary that the capacity for landing should be increased. The volunteer engineers can do it quicker and better than the quartermaster's department.

Respectfully,

W. V. HUTCHINGS,

Captain and Acting Chief Quartermaster, Tenth Army Corps.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,In the Field, July 9, 1864.

General W. T. H. BROOKS, Tenth Corps:

The infantry details will not be needed till Monday. No work to-morrow. Please tell Captain Hutchings that an engineer detail to build that wharf will report on Monday morning.

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General WEITZEL, Acting Chief of Staff:

Officer of the picket on General Terry's front reports troops moving in large bodies to our right.

ED. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

GENERAL BROOKS' HEADQUARTERS,

July 9, 1864.

Brigadier-General WEITZEL:

Further information from General Terry's front shows previous dispatches to have been exaggerated. The body of troops seen to move is probably not more than a regiment.

ED. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
