Lieutenant Colonel DONN PIATT,

Baltimore:

The One hundred and fifty-first New York just arrived. The troops from Martinsburg are now arriving by the tow-path; crossed the river at Shepherdstown. I have not seen General Tyler yet. He is here, but is now sleeping. I have no particulars about the engagement; learn; however, that our loss is small. A small portion of the troops went via Williamsport. Have not heard from them.
