Reno stated to me that he was absent with a view to secure the commissioning of several officers absolutely necessary to the efficiency of his command. Having received the order detaching him from my command, should not his explanation come through General Egan?

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

CONFIDENTIAL.] HDQRS. MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,

March 19, 1865.

General J. D. STEVENSON,

Harper's Ferry:

The general wishes the New York troops you speak of sent to Charlestown. They will be under General Egan's command. General Egan will be at Harper's Ferry this morning and arrange with you. The Twenty-fifth Cavalry, New York, will report to you to-morrow to relieve the First Maryland, when the general desires you to send the One hundred and ninety-fifth and One hundred and ninety-second Pennsylvania to report to General Egan for reorganization, as directed by the War Department. These dispositions of troops are provisional, and permanent arrangements will not be made until it is known how many new regiments are coming. You will have to keep a strict hand on the Twenty-fifth New York, as it said to [be] in not first-rate discipline, though full of officers. The general wishes you to hold the colonel strictly to the mark. You make to send him before a board unless he reforms his habits.
