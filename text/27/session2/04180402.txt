Character But as a Western man he could not consent that
all the public funds should be expended on the seaboard, espe>
«ally when a great portion of these funds were drawn from
the pockets of the Western people, whilst none of them were
expended there Unal he was satisfied that they were to have
a idir dividen J among them, he should request othei gentlemen
to practi e towards themselves that economy which they prac
tisedtowar s others
Mr McK£QN assured the gentleman from Indiana that he
must have ini-=sundeistood the remark made by him as to Capt
Gedney„ The Common Council oi the great commercial empon
urn of this Union had formed so high an opinion of the work of
Capt Gedney, ard especially the disc very he had made which
promised so much advantage to tha'city, thatacompHment was
paid by that city to that distinguished officer It wa*> a year or
two after the act was done, this distinction was conferred fey
that city on Capt Gedney, as that city had on other occasions
conferred upon om citizens who had conferred benefits on their
country by their seivices He remarked well the circum
stances of the compliment He was one of those who believed
that «uch marks of esteem and commendation did not only teach
the individual on whom they were confened, but íeachtd and
shed vheir lustre on the Government that employed such oiliceis
as proved themselves worthy of those distinctions
Mr GWIN mos ed an amendment providing that "the saia
sum should be expended m a smvey of the Gulf of Mexico,
commencing at the mouth of the Sabine "
Mr G said, as for many years large sums had been expended
atthe North, bethought it was but justice to the South and
Southwest that this amendment should be adopted
Mr STANLY said the gulf survey was alieady going on
that $10000 weie expended on it for the year 1841, and tint the
Commute*1 on ¡Vlilitaij Atfairb had rtpoiiedabill appropriating

Mr GWÍNc-nd ii this was the ca^e he would withdiaw the
amendment, ¿nd n was accordingly withdrawn
Mr flOIAIi'^ (vvhOi,eiemaikts were very mdis mcrly heaid

very improper íemarks of the gentleman from Indiana, [\Ir
Kennedy,] who had ju^ttaken his ieat That gentleman, who
was without respect of character, and without an acq lainiance

that or any other pirtion of God'a footstool, or being capable of
giving a ¡ectu re on scientific sut vey*, such as the genthman h id
treated the co tim ttee with, was absolutely necessary to know
ledger he (Mr K > confessed he was ignorant, but on these non
essentials the gent'eman w as himself, it seemed, infinitely wise
So far as u ahce was concerned, he (Mr K ) could not be
malicious towards the gentleman's friend, for-he did not know
him, either by name or by sight, in fact, he (Mi K ) did not
know, when he referred to him, whether he was the head or the
tail of the&nenhjic corps of engineers who were perambulating
our coast, nor did he care Nor did he know or care whether
this gentleman [Mr Holmes] was or or was not the fuend of
the captain ot the n ivy flus would acquit him (Mr 1Í ) of
malicious feeling But if he had kr own the captain, and had
known that the gentleman [Mr Hoiml&] was his particular
fitend, h sh( u d btiU have said what he did So far, then, is
ignorance of tne man was concerned fichad done nothing fi'oui

his mind that tieit, w-is snmetnmg conuj)t in him That wat-
what he said an I b fit \ ej and what the com s had decid11

to the celebrated case ofNichola- B ddle, who, after rec ívjng
his salary as an officer of the Bank of the United States, rt
1   ceived also a donation of some $20,000 m a service of plate
'   paid for out of the funds of the Bank, and the stockholders
and creditors of the Bank have been beggared by this and other
such means    Was not that prima facie evidence of corrup
But the gentleman said that he (Mi K) 'had «¿area to call
l galltnt officer of the navy and a friend of his, a scoundrel "
Now he (Mi K ) had stated what he had said and what he meant
by his former remarks But he woum tell that gentleman that
what he had "dared" to say he "dared" to tepeat, without re
gaid to who he was ox who might be his friends.                            ■
He did not believe that the lecture he had leceived from the
gentle nan was so much owing to what he had said about the
silver p'atc, as it was from some other remarks It might be,
and he was nther inclined to believe it was, owing to the fact
that he (Mi K) had shown a disposition to have even handed
justice done to all portions of the country There were cer
tain men that expected ceitain portions of tne country tobe
made the recipients of public favor from time to eteinitv, when
the burdens of it were to be imposed on the pockets of others
He, as a western man, entered his potest against it and this,
perchance, may have been the amount of his offending He,
therefore, wanted it distinctly understood from this time forth,
tha* no man, however learned he might be, or however dc
void of malice his bosom might b°, should ever duve him ore
inch from the dis barae of his duty to his constituents, ig-
norm* ihoushhe might be

misunderstanding He had since been informed th-t the othei

in order for him to piesent The re ohm n to which he ailu*

coast of the Gulf of Mexico, from Apalachicola to the mouth of
the Mississippi r ver, and of the plan of defence best adapted to
the Gulf" &c made by LieutenantL M Powell in 1841, by
order of the Boaid of Navy Commissioners "
It appeared that a survey had been made of the coast of the
Gulf of Mexico from Apalachicola to the Bah7e, oi mouth of the
Mississippi arlthe report made bvL'eut Powell of such suney

which the whole eommerc0 of Alabama, M s i««ippi, and the
whole AIissi^ippi vallev wasconducted, and for the protection
of which, inthe evpnt of war, the means provided by Govern
ment were totally inadequate
The publication of the repoit of this survey (Mr S said)
would doubtless conduce greatly to th*1 advantage and security
of those engage 1 m navigation rm that coast
The proposition of the gentleman from (eoreia(Mr Cooper)
to strike from the bill the appropriation of one hundred thous
and dolíais for the continuation of the survey of the Atlantic
coast,   he hoped would not piev-ai!     Th*H survey had com

of the harbors,  of vessels of the   onhnary  clas=i     He hop^d
that a more accurate and thorough survey of this coast would
lead, as it had done m the case of the New "iork coast, to the
discovery of deeper channels oi  inlets and safer and deeper
anchorages
The interests involved in the navigation of the GulfofMex
ico, he ^aii,wete of vast, almost incalculable magnitude, and
deservedas vigorous prosecution of thiseuivcy as possible
to the end that it might reach and embrace the coa-t within a
short period of time
He could not vote for the motiin of his friend from Mnsis
sippi [Mr Gwii,] inasmuch as the proviso proposed by him
would have the effect of an esting the survey on the Atlantic
coast, which he thought uti be of real importance for rea
sons he had stated s'ionld he completed
[Mr Gwin here «i greeted that he would modify hi* motion
í?o as to tequire one half of the sum proposed to be expended
m the survey of the Gulf coast and the other half on the \tlan
tic coast]
Mi feHiELDS «laid the ^um so divided would not he sufficient
to fuimsh the necessary vessels i imruments, equipage and
scientific corps for an advantageous commencement and pro
secution of the survey m the Gulf if he did not mi*: ike it
would not be half as much as had been required to make the
necessary prepaiat ons for the commencement of the hi rvey
on the Atlantic For the present he was willing to peimttthat
survey to go on regularly, provided it \s ere not re arded ind
embarrassed so as to prevent an early apj íoich lo the Gulf
coast If it were, he would anxiously contribute his mite to
the establishment of a newor ad Jitional party of smvey for the
early completion of the woik tlvre
Mr GWIN modified his amendment so ae to apply its pro
vis on to one half only of the amount ol the item,
Mr. FILLMORE would state, in reference to the amend-
ment of the gentlemen from Mississippi, [Mr Gwínt j that this
survey commenced on Long Island, and, at the commence
ment, it was necessary to survey a bat.e line—and it wuld be
at any place—which was done with great experse and delay,
requiring more than a year 3 time He cor^equence would

The gentleman from AHbama [Mr &HiEi>Db] had supposed
that there was no appropriation for surveys on the^Gulf.
He would find that an appr< priation of S30 0C0 had*been
made for military surveys, intended entirely foi the Gulf of
Mexico
Mr GWIN -said his amendment did not contemplate stop-
pma the suivej ILs object was that the <-mve> oí the Gulf
of Mexico should commence, and at the Sabne He was wil-
ling to vote for ©200,000 it necessaiy, and they might have two

Mr CHARLES BROW'S hoped they would not stop the sur-
