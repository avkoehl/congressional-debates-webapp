Mr. HOLMAN. I object.
coston's night signals.
Mr. STEVENS moved that the rules be sus-
pended, and that the House resolve itself into the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union.
The motion was agreed to.
So the rules were suspended; and the House
accordingly resolved itself into the Committee of
the Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr. Strat-
ton in the chair.)
The first bill in order upon the Calendar was
bill of the House No. 97, authorizing the pur-
chase, for the use of the Navy, of Coston's night
signals.
Mr. SEDGWICK. A bill from the Senate for
the same purpose passed the House earlier in the
session, and I move that this bill be laid aside, to
be reported to the House with the recommenda-
tion that it be laid upon the table.
The motion was agreed to.
enlistment oe minors.
The committee then proceeded to the consider-
ation of the next bill upon the Calendar, being
oill of the Housa.No. 151, in regard to the en-
Jistment of minors, and for other purposes.
Speeches upon the general politics of the coun-
try were made by Messrs. McPHERSON and
KNAPP. [Their speeches will be published in
the Appendix.]
At the expiration of Mr. Knapp's hour,
Mr. ROBINSON asked that, by unanimous
consent, he be allowed a few minutes to conclude
his speech.
Mr. WHITE, of Indiana, objected.
Mr. WICKLIFFE. Mr. Chairman, 1 hope
that my friend will not be allowed to proceed.
He has already, ill a style bold, and by a logic
of speech severe, inflicted upon the gentlemen on
the other side of the House, a just and severe
castigation for the errors of their ways. I am a
Constitution-observing man. Our bill of rights
declares that "cruel and unusual punishment
shall not be imposed." I hope he will not be
allowed further time to thus violate this merciful
rule of civil and political rights.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I protest against
the gentleman from Kentucky getting up here to
strike down his own friend.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont, obtained the
floor, but yielded it to
Mr. WHITE, of Indiana, who moved that the
committee rise.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose; and Mr. Colfax hav-
ing taken the chair as Speaker pro tempore, Mr.
Stratton reported that the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union had had the
Union generally under consideration, and particu-
larly bill of the House No. 97, authorizing the
purchase, for the use of the Navy, of Coston's
night signals, and had directed him to report the
same to the House, with the recommendation that
it be laid upon the table; also that the committee
had had under consideration bill of the House
No. 151, in regard to the enlistment of minors,
and for other purposes, and had come to no con-
clusion thereon.
On motion of Mr. STRATTON, bill No. 97
was laid upon the table.
missouri wak expenses.
Mr. ROLLINS, of Missouri, by unanimous con-
sent, introduced a bill to pay to the State of Mis-
souri the amount of money expended by said State
in arming and paying the troops employed in sup-
pressing an insurrection against the authority of
the United States; which was read a first and sec-
ond time, and referred to the Committee on Mili-
tary Affairs.
agricultural colleges.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont, asked the unani-
mous consent of the House to have printed a sub-
stitute which he designs to offer for bill of the
House No. 38, granting public lands to the sev-
eral States and Territories having agricultural col-
leges.
Mr. HOLMAN objected.
finances.
Mr. VALL ANDIGIIAM entered a motion to

And then, on motion of Mr. MORRILL, of

m.,) the House adjourned

capture of new orleans.
The VICE PRESIDENT laid before the Sen-
ate a report of the Secretary of the Navy, com-
municating, in compliance with a resolution of
the 22d of May, the official reports and docu-
ments connected with the recent engagements on
the Mississippi river, which resulted in the cap-
ture of Forts Jackson and St. Philip and the city
of New Orleans, and the destruction of the rebel
flotilla.
Mr. GRIMES. I move that that communica-
tion, with the reports and documents, be printed.
The Senate has already ordered a number of
copies to be printed for the Navy Department;
but it may be necessary that an order should be
made for the printing of copies for the Senate,
and that motion, I presume, will go to the Com-
mittee on Printing.
The VICE PRESIDENT. A motion to print
the ordinary number will not go to the Commit-
tee on Printing, but only a motion to print extra
numbers, if the Chair recollects rightly.
Mr. GRIMES. The Senate has already or-
dered that three thousand copies of that report
be published for the use of the Navy Depart-
ment. It may be necessary to refer it to the
co iti rn i ttcc.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It will be referred
to the Committee on Printing, and the ordinary
number only will be printed.
Mr. ANTHONY subsequently said: A reso-
lution for the printing of the reports of the recent
naval engagement in the Mississippi near New
Orleans was referred to the Committee on Print-
ing undera misapprehension. The order to print
has already been adopted by the Senate. I there-
fore move that the Committee on Printing be
discharged from the further consideration of the
resolution.
The motion was agreed to.

claims of robert brent.
Mr. POMEROY. The Committee on Claims,
to whom was referred the bill (H. R. No. 195)
for the reciprocal extinguishment of certain claims
between the United States and the representatives
of Robert Brent, deceased, have had the same
under consideration, and have directed me to re-
port it back without amendment, and recommend
its passage.
Mr. LATHAM. I move that that bill be con-
sidered now. It is a short bill and makes no ap-
propriation whatever. It merely provides for the
extinguishment of the claim of the Government
against the estate of Robert Brent. It will give
rise to no debate.
There being no objection, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to consider
the bill. It directs the Solicitor of the Treasury
to discontinue and to cause to be entered satisfied
all suits and proceedings upon the claim of the
United States against the representatives of Rob-
ert Brent, late Paymaster General of the United
States Army, and against the representatives of
Robert Y. Brent, his executor; such discontinu-
