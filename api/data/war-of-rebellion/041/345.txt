HEADQUARTERS TROOPS IN THE FIELD,November 11, 1863-8 p. m.

General Lee and force have returned. The enemy followed his rear very closely with cavalry and artillery. But we damaged them with our artillery more than they did us. He estimates the force that he saw deployed in front of Carrion Crow Bayou as 4,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry, and three batteries. Our casualties are about 15. Captain Marsh, One hundred and eighteenth Illinois Mounted Infantry, killed; also 1 or 2 men.

GENERAL: Yesterday at dusk the enemy withdrew his pickets from our front. He returned again this morning with a large observing force, but I think that it is a rear guard, and that we have ceased to amuse him. This morning a brigade of cavalry, with two guns, went to Saint Martinsville and above. Has seen no enemy.

I think of sending the heavy guns to New Iberia to-morrow.

The question of overcoats and blankets for the men of this command is becoming a very serious one. The want of them is affecting the health of the men. They were stored before we started for Sabine, when a short campaign was expected.

With the large force of cavalry of the enemy, he can make it very uncomfortable for us between here and New Iberia, and, besides, he can get to New Iberia by the right before I can. I think it will be well to make that point our extreme one. What do you think of this, or does your dispatch mean the Teche proper? That is, do you consider Vermillion a part of the Teche country?

P. S.-The forage question at this point will soon become important.
