THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 14,
Mr. FEATHERSTON moved that the rules
of the House be suspended, and that the House
resolve itself into Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union.
Mr. THOMAS said, that as he was desirous of
testing- the sense of the House on taking up the
private business on the Speaker's table, he would de-
mand the yeas and nays on the question of going
into Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union.
The veas and nays were not ordered.
Mr. STRONG said that the House would recol-
lect that a report of the Committee of Elections on
the case of Wm. Messervy, a Delegate from New
Mexico, was postponed until last Monday. It
was important that that matter should be disposed
of. He asked that it might be taken up.
The SPEAKER said that it could only be done
by unanimous consent.
Several Members objected.
The question was then taken on the motion of
Mr. Feathers-ton', and it was agreed to. The
House accordingly resolved itself into Committee
of the Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr.
Meade in the chair,) on the river and harbor bill.
TheCHAIRM AN stated that the pending ques-
tion before the committee was the river and liarbor
bill, reported by the chairman of the Committee
on Commerce; on which question the gentleman
from Maryland [Mr. McLane] was entitled to the
floor.
Mr. McLANE, of Maryland, said: When I
presented this bill to the attention of the commit-
tee, it was not my purpose to have occupied its
time with any remarks of my own. I merely
proposed to state to the committee the principles
by which I desired to be governed in perfecting
the bill, and in finally giving it my vote. More
than one of my friends, however, felt them-
selves at liberty to interrupt that purpose by re-
marks that were neither very parliamentary nor
pertinent to the question. I feel, therefore, that I
have no apology to offer to the committee for aban-
doning my original purpose and engaging in a
course of remark somewhat too discursive for my
own taste, or that of the committee, perhaps. I
wish further to say, that when I responded to the
inquiry of my friend from South Carolina upon
my right, [Mr. Holmes,] that I did not. feel myself
at liberty to treat his inquiry as serious and wor- i
thy grave attention and reply, but rather of the
classjustly deemed not pertinent, and following '
Dr. Paley's ethics, to be disposed of as imperti-
nent,—I therefore, in defining Democracy, pre-
sented such a view of it as I thought most likely to
attach itself to, and be appreciated by, the gentle-
maivfrom South Carolina, [Mr. Holmes,} without
any regard to my own sense of its spirit or
Fnnciples. When, sir, my duty requires that
should define those principles of Democracy,
either in the abstract, or in view of the principles
of legislative action by which I profess to be
governed, I hope to treat the subject more grave-
ly and very differently, both in point of diction
and spirit, from the manner in which I chose to
dispose of his inquiries. However, sir, the ex-
planation I now make is hardly necessary to as-
sure those who heard me that I consider the ques-
tion worthy more respect than the gentleman from
South Carolina would esteem it—and indeed I have
no fear that the report of my remarks will convey
a different impression to any one. I refer to it
with no view to correct that report, but rather to
authorize the appeal I now make to gentlemen on
both sides, not to interrupt me in the discharge
of my duty in preseq||ng thin bill to their atten-
tion.
I desire thut the Clerk will read to the committee
ft few pages from the report of the Topographical
Bureau, that I now seud to his desk. And before
the reading, I will call the attention of the com-
mittee to the statement I have already made, that
the bill now pending was framed by the Commit-
tee on Commerce, upon the river and harbor bill,
which was enacted into a law in 1838. We find 1
since the year 1838, that such vicissitudes have
accompanied the consideration and enactment of
such lawfc, that there was no fixed or stable stand-
ard that the committee could adopt, and I deemed
it therefore expedient to go back to the last entire
and perfect law which had been passed. That
ww the bill of 1838. I called upon the Secretary
of War to furnish me with the report of the Topo-
graphical Bureau, as to what public works had
I been authorized by law, and had been transferred
and assigned to the superintendence and direction
of the Bureau of Topographical Engineers, on its
organization in 1838. This corps wjis organized
very much with a view to take immediate charge
of the public works authorized by law, and imme-
diately after its organization the law of 1838 was
enacted, and all works embraced by that law were
assigned to that bureau. The report for the read-
ing of which I now call, will bring to the attention
of the committee the principles and details of the
bill which then became a law, as follows:
The Clerk then read the report.
