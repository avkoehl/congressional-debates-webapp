are refusing to deliver, in the hope that the Governors of the States will come into competition with the United States in the market and raise the price. Not a gun more could be purchased if all the Governors were in the market and the price doubled. We expect in the course of a week to receive from Europe a large number of good arms, now afloat, and to buy quite a large number now in market, of which Indiana shall promptly receive her full proportion.

P. H. WATSON,

Assistant Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., September 5, 1862.

His Excellency Governor MORTON,

Indianapolis, Ind.:

My telegram of August 26 gives your full quota. No draft has yet been ordered to fill old regiments. Let your attention be confined to the number stated, viz, 42,500 in all. I hope your volunteers for old and new regiments will equal this number and relieve you from draft under present orders.

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., September 5, 1862.

Adjt. General N. B. BAKER,

Davenport, Iowa:

See my telegram of Augusta 26. If you place in the field 22,000 under last calls for volunteers and militia you need not draft.

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., September 5, 1862.

His Excellency ISRAEL WASHBURN,

Governor of Maine, Augusta, Me.:

SIR: In reply to yours of the 2nd instant* inquiring the action of examining surgeons in cases of disability of drafted men will be final as regards such disability, I am directed to say that surgeons have no right to reject men. They simply certify to the physical condition of the man. It is for the commissioners to judge of the sufficiency of the reason for which exemption is claimed. Commissioners should be instructed to reject no one who can fight and do other military duty.

By order of the Secretary of War:

C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.
