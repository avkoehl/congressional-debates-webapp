(Same to the President and General Bragg.)
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, May 10, 1864-8.15 p.m.

General EWELL:

GENERAL: It will be necessary for you to re-establish your whole line to-night. Set the officers to work to collect and refresh their men and have everything ready for the renewal of the conflict ad daylight to-morrow. I wish General Rodes to rectify his line and improve its defenses, especially that part which seemed so easily overcome this afternoon. If no flanking arrangement a ditch had better be dug on the outside, and an abatis made in front. Perhaps General Grant will make a night attack as it was a favorite amusement of his at Vicksburg. See that ammunition is provided and every man supplied.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,R. E. LEE,

General.

Have you heard of the whereabouts of the enemy? Have Stuart and Fitz. Lee, or either, actually moved? They should do so by all means at once, if not on their way.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

At 5 p.m. the enemy were grazing their horses at Ground Squirrel Bridge on the South Anna, 9 miles from here. I have as yet no proof that he is going to Richmond. Have sent out scouts to intercept the head of a column moving in that direction. I will report as soon as heard from.
