There are also four 10-inch columbiads, one 8-inch columbiad rifled, and two rifled 42-pounders, mounted in casemate, bearing on the pass toward Sullivan's Island and on Rebellion roads.

I remain, very truly, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.

Respectfully submitted to Secretary of War, with the views* within referred to.

CHARLESTON, S. C., April 17, 1864-8 a. m.

Is it not likely enemy will operate from New Berne, on Goldsborough and Raleigh; if so, is it not advisable to concentrate about Goldsborough? Will my base be on Richmond or Wilmington?

General B. BRAGG,

Commander-in-Chief, Richmond, Va.

CHARLESTON, April 19, 1864.

Enemy is still strong in our front. Should he withdraw large force to concentrate in North Carolina, your suggestion can be carried out to extant of two brigades, but northwest portion of this State should be watched closely from expedition through North Carolina.

Numbers 29. Reports of Major General Samuel Jones, C. S. Army, commanding Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, of operations April 20-September 1.

CHARLESTON, April 20, 1864.

Your telegram of to-day to General Beauregard received. There are movements of the enemy's troops now in progress, indicating that at lest a serious demonstration will very soon be made at some point in this department. I earnestly ask that no other troops than those now under orders and moving be sent out of this department until the enemy's designs are more clearly developed.

Major-General.
