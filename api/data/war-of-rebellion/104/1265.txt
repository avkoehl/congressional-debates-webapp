Captain W. F. BULLOCK, Jr.,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Meridian, Miss.:

Courier from Suggsville noon yesterday brings information of nine gun-boats having just passed Gainestown Landing, going up. The Virginia is reliably reported as having been carried to Mobile by a gun-boat.

DEMOPOLIS, April 25, 1865.

Captain W. F. BULLOCK, Jr.,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Meridian:

CAPTAIN: The package of circulares was received by me from Major Sayers this morning and will be distributed as directed. I inclose a letter* for the lieutenant-general commanding. Captain Smith, of the scouts, reports me, under date of 23rd instant, 4 p. m., at Suggsville, that the Federals are offering $6 per cord for wood delivered on the banks of the Alabama in a few days, and asks for instructions in this case as well as in regard to cotton on the river. I have said to him that as we have now no boats on that river the people engaged in hauling wood are engaged in giving aid and comfort to the enemy, and in all such cases the wood must be burned and he teams taken away. When cotton is on the river-banks the owners must be notified to halt it into the interior to a place of safety, and if they neglect or refuse to do so it must be burned rather than let the enemy have it; but in no case to destroy it except as a last resort. No boats reported in either river.

Hoping these directions may be approved, I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.

DEMOPOLIS, April 25, 1865.

Major J. K. McCALL, Chief of Artillery, Meridian:

Commander Farrand states that he has no ordnance or ordnance stores suitable for field service. A few days since, at the request of General Taylor, he turned over at Gainesville about eighty barrels of powder.

S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.
