BILLS REFERRED TO COURT OF CLAIMS.
Mr. STANTON, of Tennessee. The gentleman
who objected to my resolution has withdrawn his
objection, and 1 ask that it may be read.
The resolution was read, as follows:
JThat all reports which any of the committees
directed to be made to the House shall be delivered to the
Ulerfc, and they are hereby ordered to be printed; and such
of them as are of a private character, together with all the
bil Is now on the Private Calendar or on the Speaker's table,
are hereby referred, with the accompanying papers, to the
court of claims.
Mr. PRATT. I objec,t to it.
Mr. STANTON. Then I move to suspend
the rules to enable me to introduce it.
The question was taken; and the motion was
agreed to, (two thirds voting in favor thereof.)
Mr. STANTON. I now demand the previous
question upon the passage of the resolution.
Mr. McMULLIN. I desire to inquire of the
gentleman from Tennessee if his resolution pro-
vides that all applications for pensions shall be
referred to the board of claims?
Mr. STANTON, it provides that all bills upon
the Private Calendar, with the accompanying
papers, shall be referred to that board, and that is
where they ought to be. Mr. Speaker, at the
suggestion of a friend near me, I will change the
phraseology of the resolution, so that it shall pro-
vide that all bills remaining upon the Private Cal-
endar or on the Speaker's table, at the close of the
present session, shall be referred, &c.
The previous question was seconded, and the
main question ordered to be put, viz: " Shall the
resolution pass?" and, being put, it was decided
in the affirmative.
So the resolution was adopted.

Mr. CHANDLER. I ask the unanimous con-
sent of the House to take from the Speaker's
table, for the purpose of putting it upon its pas-
sage, Senate bill No 615
The bill was read through for information. It
authonzesand directs theappropriation of $30,000,
out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise
appropriated, for continuing the construction of
the harbor on the east side of Reedy Island, in the
Delaware river.
Mr. HAM ILTON. I object to that bill.
Mr. CHANDLER. 1 move a suspension of
the rules for the purpose which I have indicated.
WITHDRAWAL OF PAPERS.
Mr. McMULLIN. 1 would ask the leave of
the gentleman from Pennsylvania and the unani-
mous consent of the House to take from the files
of the House the petition and papers in the case
of Humphreys.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. Is it proposed to
leave copies?
Mr. McMULLIN. Copies will be left.
It was ordered accordingly.
BOUNTY LAND BILL.
Mr. IIIBBARD. I hope the gentleman from
Pennsylvania will yield to me to ask the unani-
mous consent of the House for leave to discharge
the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union from the further consideration of House bill
(No. 567) supplemental to the act entitled "An
act granting bounty land to certain officers and sol-
diers who have been engaged in the military ser-
vice of the United States," approved September
28, 1850; and also to the act approved March 22,
1852, to make land warrants assignable, and for
other purposes.
Mr. STANTON, of Kentucky. I object. It is
unfair to other gentlemen and myself, who have
bills in charge.
Mr. WENT WORTH, of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, the bill which the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania dtsires to have passed has been passed by
Congress, since my service here, six or eight
times.
Mr. CHANDLER. And has been vetoed in
the river and harbor bill. It is now offered as a
separate bill.

to suspend the rules.
RETIRED LIST IN THE ARMY.
Mr. FAULKNER. Mr. Speaker, I ask the
unanimous consent of the House for leave to re-
port back from the Committee on Military Affairs
Senate bill (No. 120) to promote the efficiency of
the Army by a retired list.
Mr. HAMILTON. I object.
Mr. FAULKNER. The subject has been care-
fully examined for twenty years, and has always
been reported on favorably. I move to suspend
the rules for the purpose which I have indicated;
and on that motion I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were not ordered.
The question was taken; and the House refused
to suspend the rules.
IRENE G. SCARRITT.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Mr. Speaker,
I ask the unanimous consent of the House for
leave to take up and pass Senate bill (No. 686) to
give a pension to the widow of Colonel Scarritt,
who fell at the battle of Buena Vista. I will state
that the Legislature of Illinois voted him a sword
for his gallantry.
The bill was read through. It authorizes and
directs the Secretary of the Interior to place the
name of Mrs. Irene G. Scarritt, widow of J. M.
Scarritt, deceased, late an officer in the United
States Army, upon the list of widows entitled to
half-pay, and pay her the sum of twenty-five
dollars per month, commencing on the first day
of July, 1854, and continuing for five years, pro-
vided, that m case of her death or intermarriage
before the expiration of the term of five years,
then thepension granted shall inure to the benefitof
the child or children of J. M. Scarritt, deceased,
under sixteen years of age, if such there be; and
if there be none, then it shall c.ease.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. Why does not this
lady get a pension under the general law ?
Mr. WASHBURNE. On account of some
technical objection. I am certain if the gentleman
understood the facts that he would not object.
Mr. JONES. Did her husband fall at Buena
Vista?
Mr. WASHBURNE. He did.
Mr. JONES. Then she is entitled to ten years'
half-pay pension under the general law.
Mr. WASHBURNE. She is not allowed it.
This is a case which appeals most strongly to our
sympathies.
Mr. PRATT. I object.
Mr. WASHBURNE. I move to suspend the
rules for the purpose which I have indicated.
The rules were suspended; there being, on a
divisionâ€”ayes eighty-four, noes not counted.
Mr. WASHBURNE. I call for the previous
question on the bill.
The previous question received a second, and
the mam question was ordered to be put.

be given ?

ous case, and I trust there will be no objection to
