out >o the world would contradict any declaration
of this kind No, sir, he said that the public
money wasunsafein the Bank of the United Slates,
because he honestly believed that it was unsafe
He acted, last year, on the fullest information, on
the highest au'hority, and on his responsibility to
his constituents Now, sir, people do not usually
apply twice to the same physician, first for a pie
gcnption, and then for rehet from the operation of
the prescription The same doctor1! who brought
the disease on the country now tell the people that
they were deceived, and that then case w>s mal
treated Will the people trusc to them again'
Will they not, at least, inqune something as to
the individuals who offer to give them this new
light' If,sir, (said Mi M ,) I havemisrepieverted
the past or pi esent opinions of any of these gentle
men, I have done it unintentionally if the people
inquire who are the men that now propose the
restoiation of the deposites, they wi 1 f nd that
some of them are the very men who, last year,
recommended the remov-U of the deposites Cer
tainly these gentlemen must then have intended to
give a diffeient destination to the deposites, when
they wished to remove them from the Bank of the
United States
But aie these gentlemen now in favor of íechar-
termg the bank' He believed not He had heard
from tnem no declaration to that effect They
are in favor of lestoring the depobites to a bank
which they deem unconstitutional
Gentlemen say that they are in favor of restor
wg the deposites, because they wish to relieve the
publ c distress     He would examine v hether the
measure would effect what it was designed to effect
If the removal of the deposites uid all the injury,
he would ask whether it would aflorJ any lelief to
put them back ' Wou'd we not be obliged to pass
through the same scene of s*uffeiing, in 1836, when
the bank winds up'   Taking their own assump
tions, he would ask gentlemen what would betne
condition of the country at the expiration of ti c
charter, and whethei the le&'oia ion of the depos
lies, at this  time, would  affoid  any permanent
relief     But it was not the tuning amount with
drawn fiom the bank which had shaken public
confidence    The bank denved its credit mainly
fiom the fact that it was the depositoiy of the
public money, coupled with the fact that the notes
of the bank weie made receivable in the payment
of dues to the Government     If the restoration of
the deposites afforded any present relief, it would
bring upon the country fourfold distress at the
expiration of the charter
Sir, the fact, that the enemies of the bank aie
now uniting with its fi lends on the question of the
deposites, is not calculated to produce a reaction in
favoi of the bank In my opinion, (said Mr M ,)
it must have a diiectly eontury tend ncy On one
side, it was said by the fi lends of the bank, that
we cannot get along without a Bank of the Urited
States, that the institution is essential to the exist
ence of the Repub'ic What was the \ lew of the
gentlemen who had now joined them' Wny,they
say the bank is unconstitutional and meX| ed ent,
and that the happiness of the people and tH sta
bility of oui institutions depend upon the abolí ion
of the bank Is not this a singular contradiction
of opinion ' Doubtless they were honest in their
opinions But does it not fill the mind witl aston
ishment to «¡ee men entertaining s ich opposite
opinions voting together The tiuth must be told
heie as well as elsewhere, and the people have a
right to know these facts
But it was said that the rights of the bank were
to be restored by a íestilution of the deposites,
and that the Piesident and the Secretary had been
guilty of a gi oss violation of vested lights Doe",
then, an unconstitutional law give such sanctity
to vested rights that they cannot be distuibed'
Do not gentlemen see that then theory is utteily
put to flight when they assume tnat rignts once
■vested can nevei be d vested by any poht ral
power'
These gertlemen had heretofore in-usted that
unconstitutional law was no law, and tnat a Sta e
could sodeclaieit In opposing the oresentcoui'e
of the Executive they have ertire'y changed tl eir
sentiment on this point We heaid agieat deal
said in the debates about magicians Now, he
apprehended that if one party in the House had its
magicians, the. other had also.   lie apprehended
that both parties had their leaders and wue-work
ers    Gentlemen on the other side, therefore, did
not so much object to the use of magic as to the
supenoi skill ot  the magicians opposed to them
They found that then own magicians were not of
the older of Aaron, and they fear that the iodo of
our magicians will swallow up all then reds     He
did  not know whether his views on this ^ulject
coneoponded with the views of any other gemle
men     He ceitainly did not impeach the motives
of any gentleman      He did not suppose that any
one in the House was disposed to legislate m refer-
ence to men     He knew that the oiject of the
people was   lot merely to put down one and  put
up anothei individual    Principle alone shojid and
does govern a gieat majonty of the people of this
coantiy in all their sentiments on public topics
There could be no community of feeling between
the people and men who sutler merely personal
considerations to control their acts     The uitelli
geice of the people had, he 'bought, been under-
rated, and those politicians vi ho piedicated then
course upon the ignoianceof the people would find
themselves deceived in the lesuhs which they an
ticipated     In the other end of the Capuol theie
were individuals who might profit by this sugges
tion     The people  understai d their lights, and
would never sufier them to be sported with by
politicians foi paitypuij oses   If gentlemen should
learn to put moie confidence in the people and less
in their own managemen!, they would better rep-
t esent the nteiests of the people
Taking it foi granted, then, (sa d Mr M ,) that
tne  publ c deposites  will not be íestored  to the
Bank of the United State?, and that the bank will
I not be rechartered, I now come to the main ol ject
of the resolution     The President is charged with
i havingseizeu upon thepuise strings of the nation
Is there any one so ignorant as to Leueve this to
be due'
l     These gentlemen wished to convey the idea that
the President has attempted to corrupt the people
by his uie of the public montys     1 hei e was not
an individual on this floor who believed it     The
people would never believe it, for it was no* true
Does the simple íemovil of deposites produce ihe
effect of giving the President any new powersover
the publ c treasure '   Had the Presidentattempted
i the exercise of any new power'
[Here the remarks of Mr Mardis weie 1 íoken
off by the expiration of the hour assigned to the
consideration of resolutions, and the House pro-
ceeded to the older of the day ]
The SFEAKER laid before the House a com-
munication, as ordered by the House, from the
Secretary of War, with the report and survey

and final pa s=y;e
Mi  SMITH moved that it should be postponed I
until Tuesday next, in consequence of the ¡.bsence,
fiom  -idisposition,ofMr Prinki iv Pierce, who
wished to submit ins views upon it
Mr MARSH \LL said it was important that |
the bid should be acted upon
Mi VA 'VDCRPOCL inquired if it was in order
to move to postpone the bul indelmtely'
The SPLAIvER sa d tne motion was not in
ordei
Mr WISE remarked that a number of his con
oti uent-. were ínteie^ted m the pas^ageof the bill,
and he hoped i   woird not be delayed on account
of the ab ence cf one membei
Mr  MASON tl ought that 'he friend? of the
bill would núL sufier any injury in acceding to the
delay that was   sued     This was due as an actof
couites> , and would rot pievent the discussion of
tl e pniu pie"* involved in the bill
I     Mi   IIIRPEP.of New Hampshire, advocated

The bill to ¡ct del morep rtr anent the mode for
supplying the Arm} of the Sj uteu States, hav ng
been takei up foi it" thud leading,
Mi   WILDE oije-teJ to the mc eased number
of Jeiks employed m the commissariat seivjpe
undei the bill
Mr THOMSON said, that on inquiry from the
Secretary of War, he had ascertained that these
cleiks had not been taken from the line, but were
placed on the same footing as otherclerks, and that
the service requned the pioposed number
Mr VANCE eulogized the present mode of
supplying the army as more economical than the
mode heietofore adopted, and he contended that,
as the commissariat department had ihrown unon
it, in addition to the duties foi merly required from
it, the labor and trouble of supplying the Indians,
there was nothn g improper in asking for an in
creased force He could testify, from his dot
knowledge, that the clerks were most laboriously*
employed, and that more competent persons were
not employed in any other department The
House should bear in mmd the numerous and
heavy defalcations that formetly took place, whilst
now theie was not an instance of a single cent
being lost
After a few remaiks in opposition from Mr
McKAY, which were not heard by the reporter—
Mr R M JOHNSON insisted upon the advan
tages, in a pecuniary point of view, to be gained
by employing competent peisons to dischaige the
various duties of the Government Hecould per-
ceive no force in the oljections to the increased
number of clerks in the commissariat service Was
not the head of that depaitment (Colonel Gibson)
a man whose integrity was not questioned, and
who accounted, as he was obliged to account, for
every single cent that parsed through his hands'
Fiom what he knew of the service, he was only
surprised that the business could be so well done,
and at so moderate an expense
Mr BLAIR, of Sniih Carolina, moved to
recommit the bill to the Committee on Military
Aftaiis
Mr WILDE submitted an amendment—
With instructions to divide the two distinct sub-
jects contained in this bill, and to report a b II for
each, inseiung in both a clause limiting the con
tmuance thereof to thiee years, and until the end
of the next session of Congress thereafter
Mi H EVERETT proposed to recommit the
bill to the Committee of the Whole House
Mr MILLER and Mr WARD objected to the
recommitment
The question to recommit, with the amendment
oroposed by Mr Wilde, was then put, and de-
cided in the negative   Ayes 60, noes 82
And the motion to íecommit the bill to the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs prevailed
The bill making appropriations for eertam forti-
fications for the year 183r), was then taken up,
and the question being, Shall this bill pass'
Mr McDUFFIE said that he regretted he had,
been prevented by indisposition from hitherto at-
tending to the progress of this bill through the
House, for if he had been well, he would have
objected to many of the uems contained m it, as
it made appropnalions for four or five new fortifi-
cations 1 wo years ago he had announced his
intention to oppose, m future, all such appropria-
tions He would now, in the spirit of perfect
frankness, and in order to have a free discussion
upon this subject, move to recommit the bill to
the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union There were appropriations foi four new
fortifications in the pi esent bill, which had not
been appropriated for until last year, but it was
not too late to correct the en or, in having made
them
Mr BARRINGCR was decidedly opposed to
any rew fortifications being trade He had ex-
am ned the bills making appropriations for the last
y eat, and non  had Leen made except for what
mght be considered nrehmmaiy measures to their
being elected He depiecated the inconsistency
of making appiopnations for fortifications, whilst
the House had u nfoimly declined making appro-
priations large enough to man them, or have them
sufficiently armed The repoit on this subject,
foi merly p-esenW by Mr Graydon, demonstra-
ted clearly that the sums usually appropriated for
that puipose would not accomplish it in foity
ytais     Why, then, add to their numoer'
Mr POLK insisted tnat theie were no appro
priation  in the pi esent oil1 foi any place for which
theie had not been previous appropriations made
by the House He looked to the thiee bills passed
during the last session, and he there found that the
