HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF FLORIDA,Fort Pickens, July 3, 1861.

Lieutenant Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.:

COLONEL: Nothing of interest has occurred at this post since my last letter. Battery Lincoln is finished and armed. Battery Scott has its last 10-inch columbiad now mounting, and the 42-pounder rifled gun will be mounted the forepart of next week. There are four rifled guns and three mortars now here on board the Vanderbilt. I shall land them as soon as possible and mount them as soon as landed.

Not having officers and men enough to man the guns I have mounted, and being about to increase the number, I have felt it to be a duty to bring one of the artillery companies from Tortugas here. i acordingly sent two companies of volunteers to that post, and ordered one of the companies now there to this. They may be expected in about a week, by which time I hope to have the guns and ammunition landed, and will be in a suitable state for either offensive of defensive operations.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HARVEY BROWN,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF FLORIDA,Fort Pickens, July 10, 1861.

Lieutenant Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: Although aware of the unpleasantness of the subject, and of the multiplicity of the cares pressing on the General-in-Chief, I am compelled by a sense of duty to again solicit his attention to the entire insufficiency of the garrison of this fort for its efficient defense. It may seem strange that a post successfully preserved by seventy-five men when almost without armament or protection, should not have enough
