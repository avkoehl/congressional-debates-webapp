CORINTH, June 21, 1862.

Major General WILLIAM T. SHERMAN, La Grange:

Yours of to-day just received. I have anticipated it as well as I could. McPherson will be able to send you two of three car-loads of provisions daily. Will not this do with what you have on hand and can get in the country to supply one division till the Memphis road is opened? Of course you must move the other division where you can get supplies. You say the Memphis road will be opened by Monday; if so, you can get supplies from that place. Major reports that he has sent a large amount there. As I cannot know the condition of things as well as you do, you must exercise your own judgment; only don't move farther east than is absolutely necessary.

H. W. HALLECK.

CORINTH, June 21, 1862.

Major General WILLIAM T. SHERMAN, La Grange:

General McPherson will load all the cars he has got with provisions for you to-morrow. As soon as the road to Columbus or Tuscumbia is opened we shall have plenty. In the mean time you must manage the best you can for supplies.

General Grant goes on to-day to take command at Memphis. I think our best line of defense will be Hernando, Holly Springs, Ripley, and Riezi, if the health of these places should be found suitable. But we must first open the road to Memphis; until that is done, place your troops where they will be most useful and can be best supplied. Nothing yet from Washington. Send following to Memphis.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

CORINTH, June 21, 1862.

COMMANDING OFFICER, Memphis:

I repeat an order sent some time ago via Columbus: "Employ all your available force in repairing railroad to Grand Junction." This must be attended to in preference to anything else.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

CORINTH, June 21, 1862.

Gov. ANDREW JOHNSON, Nashville:

The enemy is driven out of all West Tennessee. East Tennessee will soon be clear of the rebels. Obstreperous women in and about Nashville you can easily manage. The regeneration of the entire State is not far off.

I shall call General Buell's attention to your complaints of Captain Greene, the provost-marshal, and others. If he does not afford a remedy soon I will.*

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
