NASHVILLE, September 25, 1864.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

My impression is that Forrest probably has Wheeler and Roddey with him. Making all allowance for stampeding he has a very large and effective force, and will, of course, strike the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad. If that road is to be save a large force must be sent to it at once.

LOVELL H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, September 25, 1864.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

The following dispatch, dated Pulaski at 4 a. m., just received:

If you wish to save the railroad and the command between here and Athens you must send by special train an officer to take command of these forces. General Starkweather is totally unfit. He is drunk and has been so for some time past. We do this from a sense of duty.

GEO. SPALDING,

Twelfth Tennessee Cavalry.

GEO. W. JACKSON,

Colonel.

VIRGIL H. LYON,

Major.

WILLIAM P. PAYNE,

Adjutant, Ninth Indiana Cavalry.

I have relieved General Starkweather and directed the senior officer there to assume command. I will go down myself with what force I can get here as soon as troops can be gotten ready and on the train. I have nothing from which I can re-enforce the troops at Pulaski, except detachments of cavalry furnished by Brigadier- General Johnson. I have heard nothing from General Granger since my dispatch of last night to Major Hoffman.

L. H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.

ATLANTA, September 25, 1864.

Major-General ROUSSEAU:

The Second DIVISION, Fourth Corps, has been ordered to Chattanooga, Running Water and Bridgeport temporarily, to enable General Steedman to re-enforce you with as many men as he can to assist in repelling raid of enemy on our railroad. Confer with him as to where his men are most needed. I hope you will be able to clean those fellows out entirely this time.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, September 25, 1864-7. 30 p. m.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

I respectfully submit the following telegram, just received from General Milroy, it being impossible for me to increase his force without too greatly diminishing it at other places.

L. H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.
