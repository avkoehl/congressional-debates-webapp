Captain HENRY A. GREENE,

First Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding Fort McRae:

CAPTAIN: Captain Bennett, assistant adjutant-geenral, brings me a very gratifying report of tyour continued successes against the Indians. The zeal which you and your men display renders it unnecessary for me to prompt you to furtehr efforts. Those that you have already made are deserving of the highest praise. I regret that you have found it necessary to use the express rider's mules. THese must be kept solely for him, as you must bear in mind that my communications with departmetn headquarters are even more important than the pursuit of Indians.

I am, captain, veryrespectfully, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-Geenal, Commanding.

HEADUQAURTERS DISTRICT OF ARIZONA,

Las Cruces, N. Mex., August 30, 1863.

Captain BEN. C. CUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant- General, Santa Fe:

CAPTAIN: I Have the honor to transmit herewith report* of Captain Joseph F. Bennett, assistant adjutant-general, which will acquaint you with an attack upon the first mail coach re- established upon the Jornada. I have received nothing whatever from department headquarters by this mail. If there were any dispatches they were destroyed by the Indians. Captain Greene has already made them pay dearly for the outrages, and was still in pursuit of them at last accounts. I shall continue the military express to Fort Craig. I visited this post, in company with Major Ruggles and Captain Enos, in hopes of receiving some advices from you as to supplies, &amp;c., that could be acted upon prior to Captin Enos's starting upon his lengthy trip. Failing these, those officers left for Tucson yesteday. Lieutenant- Colonel Coult also went at same time to assume hiscommand. I also have th honort otransmit certified copy of Captain Dresher's (First Infantry California Voluteers, commanding at Fort West) report of the loss of animals at hat post. From what I can learn no steps were taken to recover these animals. Captain Dresher appears to have quietly submitted to this infliction. The affair shall be investigated. Major McCleave came in here yesterday from the members. He will return in a day or two, and then pursue active and vigorous operations. Th egernal commanding will boserve that the Indians are very active. We will be no less so in pursuit of them. Our force, though ample for any contat with the savages, is too limited to insure that contact. We will do the best we can.

I am, captain, veryrespectfully, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier- General, Commanding.
