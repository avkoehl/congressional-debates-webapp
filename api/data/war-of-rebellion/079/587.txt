General R. S. GRANGER, Decatur:

If the enemy have not got possession of the Elk River Ford, I wish you to have the garrison of Athens reoccupy that place again. Brown's Ferry and Elk River Ford should be held as long as possible.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

DECATUR, ALA., November 1, 1864-10. 15 a. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

I had already ordered the reoccupation of Athens. I have a heavy picket of cavalry at Brown's Ferry; have ordered 100 infantry there also. All my cavalry is on the river. Have ordered my strongest regiment to Elk River Ford; would have done so before but could not get transportation.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

He says Major Hutsell, Second Tennessee, will camp five miles WEST of here, on the road to Florence, to-night, and fall back to this point in the morning. The eight companies of my command are now at this point; will have to send or come in for rations, or run corn mills. Please send orders if a force is to remain at this ferry. I think a force should be kept on the Athans and Florence road opposite this point, to prevent its being cut off or flanked.

G. R. SWALLOW,

Major Tenth Indiana Cavalry.

Major-General THOMAS:

All quiet along the river. Sent two gun-boats from here to-day. One goes up the river and Stone River goes down to Brown's Ferry with troops. I shall leave for Huntsville some time to-night with part of a regiment to look after the defenses of the road. Will be back at daylight in the morning and see if I can possibly get transportation for additional troops for defense of Elk River.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

General J. L. DONALDSON, Chief Quartermaster:

I would urgently request that your order a train of five flats and a caboose to this place, to be entirely subject to my orders, for patrolling the road. I found such an one, strengthened with timber, extremely
