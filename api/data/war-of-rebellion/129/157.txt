of his Department would be subject to my control. Owing, however, to the want of proper instructions Messrs. Fraser, Trenholm &amp; Co. do not feel authorized to transfer the funds of the Department from one bureau to another on my order; besides, these gentlemen inform me that the proceeds of all cotton received by them on account of the War Department are always anticipated by drafts from yourself and the other purchasing officers at Nassau and Bermuda.

You will thus see the dilemma in which I am placed by the appearance of your drafts. To refuse them would entirely destroy your credit at Nassau, and to accept them without knowing where the money is to be had to meet them would have quite as fatal an effect here and England, where our credit again begins to look up. I shall, however, take the latter risk, and accept the bills you have already drawn, provided they do not exceed @20,000; but you must not on any account draw again unless I should advise you that I am in funds, as it would only result in having your bills dishonored. When the Secretary of War gave you authority to draw on me he was under the entire misapprehension as to the state of our finances in Europe. Of the drafts advised of in your letter of the 16th of January the following have been presented and will be accepted:

Two other drafts of @250 each, dated 14th of January, in favor of H. W. Goldning, esq., and Messrs. Servine, Morris & Co. (Nos. 265 and 269), have been presented, which are not be accepted until I have further advice from you. In all instances when you draw on me advise me of the same.

With much respect, your obedient servant,

C. J. McRAE,

Agent, &c.

GENTLEMEN: Major Huse desires me to say that the new accounts have been received from Messrs. Isaac, Campbell & Co., but they appear to be entirely unsatisfactory. While some corrections have been property made the accounts are deficient in many respects; the matter of commissions is sought to be evaded by deducting them.

Major Huse has handed the papers to Messrs. Quilter, Ball & Co. to elicit their opinion before submitting them to you. They will throw some important light on the accounts as originally rendered.

I am, gentlemen, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

COLIN McKINSIE.
