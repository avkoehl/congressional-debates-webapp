IN THE FIELD,

Near Jonesborough, Ga., September 6, 1864-3 p.m.

(Received 11.05 p.m. 8th.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have just received your telegram,* and shall announce it to the whole army, preceded by the expression, "The general commanding announced to the army with pride and satisfaction," and followed by "All corps, regiments, and batteries may, without further notice, inscribe, `Atlanta' on their colors." We are moving back to Atlanta slowly, making a good use of the corn-fields, which our animals needed, and to prevent a boast of the enemy that we were in a hurry. I have burned a good deal of cotton, but will save enough to pay the expenses of the salute.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

The officers named in your dispatch of the 5th will be ordered to report to the Governor of Indiana, for special duty, as soon as I return to Atlanta, which will be in a day or two, unless the enemy shows fight, which I am willing to accept on his own terms, if he will come outside of his cursed rifle trenches.
