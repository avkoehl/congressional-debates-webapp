ELECTION OF PRINTER.
Mr. McKINLEY, on leave, submitted the fol-
lowing resolution-     *
Resolved, That this House will, on Thursday
next, proceed to the election of printer to the
House of Representatives of the next Congress.
Mr ROBERTSON said he hoped the resolution
wou'd not be adopted A few ¿lays ago, he had
himself offered a resolution piovidmg for the abo-
lition of the office of printer, both to the House
of Representatives and the Senate of the United
States, and he hoped it would be the pleasuieof
the House to consider this resolution before pro-
ceeding to adopt that of the gentleman fiom Ala-
bama,"binding the House to proceed to the elec-
tion of this officei on a given day If it weie the
pleasme of this House, Mi R would regaid it
incumbent upon him, at that time, to submit to
the House, briefly and concisely,the views which
had led him to the conclusion that the office in
question ought to be abolished, and which would
recommend his own resolution to the favorable
attention of the House
The CHAIR íemarked that it would not be in
order, the subject under consideration being the
resolution of the gentleman fiom Alabama
Mr ROBERTSON asked leave of the House
to proceed.
The CHAIR said the gentleman might proced
to offer any remarks applicable to the resolution
just presented
Mr ROBERTSON was notaware of the precie
mode by which he could attain his object, but he
had supposed it would be in order, in discussing
the propriety of the resolution offered by the gen-
tleman from Alabama, to show what was the
purpose of one, relating to the same subject, of-
fered by himself on Saturday The more bo, as
the latter proposed to abolish the office itself, for
the appointment of which the othei had set ap-u-t
a given time He should not occupy much time
in urging the reasons which had induced him to
propose that resolution to the House.
Thei e weie a few considerations that at once pre-
sented themselves in connexion with this question  i
It had been said that there was, in point of fact, '
no such office as that of printer to the Hous , or i
printer to the Senate, that it was nothing more |
than a mere contract, and that the mode of ap- ,|
pomtment, by which he was elected annually or I
biennially, was nothing more than the designation
of the individual with whom  the contiact was  '
made.  To his mind, however, it appealed to pes- |
sess all the features that constituted an offi"er m
its most compiehensive sense, like other officers, |
he was regularly nominated, brought into compe- I
Ution with other candidates, and was elected by
regulai ballot.    In this point of view he was an i
officer, and  the question  then presented  itself,'
which was amply discussed on a former day, I
whether he was propeny an officer belonging to  1
the Government of the United States, or a peculiar ¡|
officei of the lespeclive Housej to which they i
were elee'ed If he be an officer of the Govern-
ment, he can dnly be so from being designated as
such in the Constitution of the United S'ates, or
because he had been, under the Constitution, cre-
ated by law. Now, the printer to eithei House
of Congress was not a constitutional officer of the
United States, because he was nowheie designated
in that instrument, nor, so far as Mr. B. was able
to find, was there any law by which he had been
made such. There was certainly a joint resolu
tion of the two Houses providing for the time and
manner of his election, but a resolution was no
law, and ought not to be regarded as of the same
force The constitutional provision authoiizmg
the creation of offices by law, could not be set
aside or obviated by a mere íesolution
The next question was, whether the printer to
the House was a peculiar officer of the House
itself?
The Constitution authorized each House to elect
its own officers, but that piovision never could
ha/e contemplated the right in each House to
create as many offieers as they choose It could
only have referíed to such officers as vverejieces-
sary and essential to theoiganization of the tiody,
ind over which they mu«-t necessa'ily have con
trol Such weie the Speaker, theClerk,Seigeant-
at-4rms,&c. Was the public printer an officer of
this description' Could we pretend that he was'
We cou'd not For the first thirty years of oui
Government the House had been legularly organ-
ized without any such officer Bui what was the
argumenten the other side' Why, that the public
printing must be provided for by law, and that
Congress must necessarily have its, prin'mg ex-
ecuted He freely acknowledged that there was
a necessity that Congress should have its pnntir g
executed, but it was equally necessary that Con-
giess should have a room, and that that room
should be furnished with seats, stationery, &,a ,
for their use, but it did not, therefore, follow
that they must elect officers under the designa-
tions architect, stationer, and upholsteier, to£ach
House But even were it so, that the printer was
regaided as the peculiar officer of tne House,
there arose this objection, which he had nevei yet
heaid answered, although often urged in that
House- What right had one Congress to elect an
officei who was a peculiar officer of the House, to
hold his office at the ensuing Congiess' They
would have as much light to elect the Speaker,
Cleik, Seigeant-at Arms, or Chaplain, as the
Punter, if he be considered an officer of the
House
But there were even more important objections
to the adoption of the resolution of the gentleman
from Alabama than tfiose founded on the constitu-
tional right of that House to create or fill such an
office as that of public printer, and which would
be removed by the adoption of that oflered by
Mr R on Saturday It would remove from that
House w h it he thought very essential should long
ago have been removed from it—'he ground of the
strong pai y excitement, that always took place,
and pioduced ouch argry discussion for the mas-
tery of thf> publ c presi by one or the othei of the
contending parties Mr S conceived the public
punting ought to be provided for in such a man-
nei, that he who looked to it should look to it only
as concerned tne public good, and the only thing
to be looked to by that House should be the con-
duct of the pnntet, not for the benefit of any polit-
ical party, but foi the benefit of the community
His plan would do this, and it adopted, would avoid
what mví i uibly to >k place—an excred debate and
an nigi y discussion, calculated to do no good, but
productive of the reverse He was for placing the
office in the hands of him who would execute the
duty best Wi y was it that they did not find it
necessary, in regard to othei contracts, or essential
for the good government of the country, to elect
other officers upon party principles' Mr 11 would
have ti e p>-ess as the Constitution of his country
intended it should be, fiee and unshackled—not
merely free from the force and influence of the
Government, but fiee from that more dangerous
influence to be exeited by means of the public
money He would have the press untrammelled,
unshackled, the palladium of our libeityand of
oui rights, and no longer the vehicle of dirty
abuse and disgusting slander The pi ess should
be protected fiom the eikets of this influence, as
well as from that patronage exerted by difleient
branches of the Government What could be ex-
pected from a printer to the House, to the Senate,
and to the Executive or the Administration, but
that eveiy abuse committed by everyone of these
departments would be oveilooked oi vindicated
by thejjnnter to each' There was ro doubt that
the public press of this country would be at all
times suSic ently unUer the control of narty, but he
Í tiusted in God  that pames wouW be allowed to
' fight their own battles by themselves, and not have
| the influence and patronage of the Government
thrown in their way
Upon these grounds, and solely upon these
grounds, (said Mr R.,) he had submitted his prop-
osition on Saturday last, and in domgso, he looked
to the suppoit of no pnntei  of any party    It
i proposed to distribute the printing among those
wl o would faithfully execute the work, and he
hoped the resolution offered that morning would
I not be received, and he would also beg leave to
state, that a motion wab then pending in the other
branch to dispense with the joint resolution under
winch the punter to that body was elected
\ The CHAIR said it was not in order to allude
to the nroceedings of the other House
I     Mr  It  said he had meiely adverted to the fact;
' and having said all hein'erded, he again reiter-
ated the 1 ope that the House would not adopt the
íesolu'ion of the gentleman fiom Alabama
Mr SUTHERLAND moved to amend the res-
olution by inseiiitig the wordb ",vna voce "
Mi   McKINLEY accepted the amendment.
Mr McKINLEY then proceeded     He did not
i know that it was necessaiy at that time to enter
I into a drcussion upon the quest'on whether the
I pi'nter to the House of Representatives was an
I officer or not, oi to mqu.re whethei a joint reso-
lution had the force and validity of a law.
Mr C ALLAN called for the orders of the
day, but the House did not second the motion,
the hour devoted to morning business not having
expired.
Mr McKINLEY resumed. It was a little sin-
gular, that whenever this qi esUon came up, there
was always a disposition by those who had not the
power to elect, to inteirupt its course by raising
the question that it was not pioper for one Con-
gress to elect a pnrtei for the ensuing one He
would admit that this House had not the right
to impose a p'inter upt n  the next House  of
I Representatives against Us will, arid he would
fieely admit tlat it belonged exclusive'y to the
House of Representatives to elect their own offi-
ceis, and that had always been his opinion, and
he would go fuither, and say he believed that the
! next House would have the right to accept or
reject the printer elected for them, as they might
j think fit But as the present practice had existed
foi some fifteen or sixteen years, during six or
I seven Congresses, why should they now all  at
1 once stop in proceeding to this election, merely
because a portipn of an opposition think other-
I wise' Mr McK then alluded to what he had
understood had fallen fiom Mr Roblrtson, with
i reference to the impropriety of electing editors of
newspapers, and said he considered it a question
altogethei for those who elected the pnntei, and
saw no reason why they should be proscribed,
whethei he was the editor of a paper or not
Mr ROBERTSON explained, and said he must
have been misapprehended, foi neither in his
remarks nor in the íesolution, had he contem-
plated any proscription     He asked leave that the
| resolution be read, and
I Mr McKINLEY giving way, they were read
accoidingly
Mr McKINLEY continued. He may have
misapprehended a part of the language of the res-
olution, but he believed himself conect, that the
gentleman in his remarks complained tnat public
patronage ought not to be extended to editors of
newspapeis It seemed, however, that if the
printer were nota fuend of the Administration,
I there was no danger of his being bribed. Indeed,
experience had proved that the gentleman was
mistaken, for he thought the present printers to
this House could not be charged with undue par-
tiality to the present Administration. He still
believed the House of Representatives to be the
proper body to designate their own printer, ac-
coidmg to the lesolutionsof 1819 aiid 1827    Tlie
