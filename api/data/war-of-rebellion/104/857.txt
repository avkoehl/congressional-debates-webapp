Major SAMUEL L. WOODWARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that I have reached camp this 4 p.m. ten miles from Columbus, after having marched twenty-two miles. Not being quite sure of finding forage nearer town, I preferred camping here, as I find both good water and forage convenient. I will march to-morrow morning early, so as to reach town with the head of my column about 8 a.m.

Hoping that the general commanding will approve of my course, I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH KARGE,

Colonel, Commanding.
