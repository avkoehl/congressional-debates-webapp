COLONEL: You can move to-morrow morning or the next day up Black River on the east side to either Powhatan or Pocahontas. Leave a sufficient outlying picket, under a good and trusty officer, at Jacksonport to report to you everything done by the enemy. Call in all your details, detachments, and pickets, and get all your men together that is possible. General Price has ordered me to move up about Pocahontas with my entire command, and my headquarter will be to-morrow night at Smithville.

Very truly, yours,

COLONEL; Brigadier-General Shelby directs me to say that you can remain where you now are until Saturday, unless you prefer to move sooner. From information received he believes that General Price will certainly be here by Saturday. You will be upon your guard if you remain longer in your present location, for all pickets have been withdrawn from Searcy and West Point.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,P. R. CARRINGTON.
