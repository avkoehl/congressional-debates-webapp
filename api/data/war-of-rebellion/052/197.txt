WICKSBURG, MISS.,

August 28, 1863.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Send flag of truce to the southern lines and inquire if General S. D. Lee has been exchanged. I have received no notice of the fact. Order all the camp and garrison equipage, men, &amp;c., of the Third Iowa Cavalry to Helena. I stopped the six companies that went with Colonel Winslow there to get the regiment together. One brigade of cavalry, 2,200 strong, besides Winslow's command, will come here from West Tennessee. I have also 3,000 horse equipments ordered, which will enable us to mount that number of infantry.

You may telegraph me the substance of your letter as you prepare or send a copy by morning train, and I will telegraph back my opinion on it. I have no doubt but what your action will be just right.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

General GRANT,

Vicksburg:

They wanted much to go out along with the next flag. If you think it proper, please notify them to come out, as I will start the flag for Canton at or after noon tomorrow.

General J. A. RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

General Dennis report, as information received from a gentleman just from Demopolis, that Breckinridge and Walker's division, 18,000 strong, have been sent to Bragg.

Have you received any notice of the exchange of any of the officers captured at Vicksburg? I notice that General Stephen D. Lee is in command of the Confederate cavalry in the interior. He was one of the Vicksburg generals, and the most enterprising of all in their army. If not properly exchanged, I would send him word that
