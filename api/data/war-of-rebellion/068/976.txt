MAY 8, 1864-4.20 p.m.

Major T. O. CHESTNEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Colonel Shingler has just returned. Reports that the picket-line of the enemy is the same as heretofore; that Port Walthall Junction is vacated; the dead and wounded of enemy left on the field. He had not received my dispatch (to press the lines and find the position) but was informed that they were now fortified, extending from river to river. I have sent out the cavalry again to drive in the pickets and ascertain the facts.

S. M. BARTON,

Brigadier-General.

MAY 8, 1864-6.35 p.m.

Major T. O. CHESTNEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A scouting party has just got in from vicinity of Port Walthall Junction. Found many wounded and dead Yankees on the battle-field; some of our own dead; a great many guns, cartridge-boxes, &amp;c. The scout in command (Thorn) pressed on, the pickets and skirmishers with them. They occupy the same posts as yesterday. Thought he saw tents. Heard that the enemy were fortifying.

S. M. BARTON,

Brigadier-General.

MAY 8, 1864-8.45 [p.m.]

Major T. O. CHESTNEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A dispatch just received from General Johnson, dated 5.30 p.m., says:

Enemy's gun-boats shelled the heights below Clifton to-day. It is probable they design to occupy those heights. We have no other movements of the enemy to report to-day.

B. R. JOHNSON,

Brigadier-General.

Nothing yet from the party of cavalry last sent out to attack pickets.

S. M. BARTON,

Brigadier-General.

[MAY 8, 1864.]

Major T. O. CHESTNEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Richmond:

I have sent you five or more telegraphic messages to-day. Have not the copies here to give exact number. Have you yet received them? Nothing from Colonel Shingler since his dispatch dated 12 o'clock, which I forwarded to you at 1.20 p.m. I supposed yours, No. 5, 1.30 p.m., was in reply to that. Shingler was ordered to press the enemy and ascertain their position. I have nothing from him.

S. M. BARTON,

Brigadier-General.
