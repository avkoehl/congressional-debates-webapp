Your two dispatches just received. The Twenty-ninth and Thirty-first U. S. Colored Troops were ordered to report to General Graham at Point of Rocks. I have heard of their arrival. The two regiments that were sent from General Butler's army have not reported.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES, November 20, 1864-4.20 p. m.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Burlington, N. J.:

All remains quiet here. Kershaw's division passed Richmond Friday. Deserters report that two brigades of it are encamped at Chaffin's farm, and the rest of it at Chesterfield. It is possible there may be an attempt to break through our lines. We will endeavor to watch it. Richmond papers insist that Sheridan's forces have arrived and are encamped on the north side of the James. Have ordered two regiments of colored troops of the Ninth Corps to the Bermuda lines. Have not sent back the two regiments of Pennsylvania troops because of Kershaw's movements. It is reported at Richmond that the remainder of Early's troops have gone into winter quarters at Mount Jackson. We are in the midst of a very severe storm, which has lasted thirty-six hours. Roads nearly impassable.

BENJ. F. BUTLER.
