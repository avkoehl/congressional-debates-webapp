CINCINNATI, July 22, 1863.

Colonel PUTNAM, Marietta, Ohio:

Reports from Athens say Morgan passed through Nelsonville toward Marietta about noon. We cannot say how reliable this is, but it should put all on guard. Send courier up the Muskingum. All places where he can cross must be watched, and every means taken to harass and check him. He has some 400 wearied and dispirited men,d without cannon. The militia should try to take him, or at least stop him till overtaken again.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.

SCOTT'S LANDING, July 22, 1863.

Brigadier General JACOB D. COX:

Your dispatch received. Morgan passed McArthur, and encamped within 3 1/2 miles of there. He passed New Plymouth, Vinton County, on his way to Nelsonville, at 9 o'clock this morning. From Nelsonville we suppose he will strike the Muskingum at Beverly, McConnelsville, or between the two places,a nd endeavor to strike the Ohio in Washington or Monroe County.

Messengers have been dispatched to the people to blockade the roads in Morgan County. Colonel Joseph Hill, with one regiment of infantry, one section of artillery, and one company of sharpshooters, have gone up the Muskingum by steamboat to intercept him. Colonel William Wallace,* will start as soon as possible from Marietta with mounted men and artillery toward Monroe County, to intercept him if he should pass Colonel Hill. I have taken the only steamboat within reach, and it will start from Parkersburg with artillery and infantry to intercept him at the Ohio. What cavalry I have is after him. I will spare no exertion to capture him.

BEN. P. RUNKLE,

Colonel, Commanding.

CINCINNATI, July 22, 1863.

General SHACKELFORD, Nelsonville, via Athens:

Dispatch received. Movements ordered farther east to intercept him if he crosses the Muskingum. Press his hard and constantly as possible.

By command of Major-General Burnside:

Brigadier-General.

Lieutenant Colonel O. L. SPAULDING, Chillicothe:

If train can be furnished, push on west to Hamden, and communicate by telegraph your arrival there, keeping your men on the cars. Morgan is reported north of athens, moving east. Show this to Mr. [N. L.] Wilson, president of the road.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.
