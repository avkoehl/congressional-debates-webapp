cating the foregoing resolution of the General Assembly, I deem it my duty as the executive of the State to say that I deeply regret the action of the Board of Public Works of your State, which in my opinion rendered the passage of said resolution eminently right and proper, and at the same time to express the hope and belief that the wrong will be repaired, and that courtesy, which has hitherto characterized the entire course between the two States, whose interests are so intimately blended, will be immediately restored. Upon learning the proceedings of your Board of Public Works, I deemed it my duty to forbid the exportation of articles to Virginia upon the railroads of this State, not by way of retaliation, but as a precautionary measure rendered necessary by the deficiency in the supply of salt which would be thus produced. That restriction shall be most cheerfully withdrawn whenever your authorities shall revoke the unprecendented order in regard to our trains. I was much pleased to see that in your message you referred to this action of the Board of Public Works with disapprobation. Hoping and believing that your Board of Public Works will, upon having this matter called to their attention, see the injustice and wrong which are likley to flow from it, and that the two States may in the future, as in the past, move on hamoniously.

I am, Governor, with much respect, your obedient servant,
