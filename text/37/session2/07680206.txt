APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Confiscation of Rebel Property—Mr. Rice.
Ho. of Reps.
mighty events, in which not only our national
existence is involved, but the grand experiment
of popular government is to be finally tried and
tested, it becomes us, the chosen Representatives
of the supreme power in the land—the people—to
weigh well the responsibilities resting upon us,
and in the light of our past history, as far as need
be, diligently to inquire into the causes of our pres-
ent calamities; and then, with purpose single to
the preservation, perpetuation, unity, and welfare
of the country, fearlessly and firmly discharge the
great duties which are and will be pressing upon
us; each responsible to himself, to his country,
and to his God, for the purity of his intentions.
Under circumstances of ordinary magnitude I
would not for a single moment detain the House
in the expression of any opinions and convictions
upon passing events and pending measures, nor
venture a single word of advice or caution as to
our future proceedings and duties; but, sir, through
the partiality and favor of a generous and intelli-
gent constituency, being placed here to deliberate
nod act upon these questions of the most vital im-
portance to them and to the country, 1 donotfeel
at liberty to remain entirely silent, but briefly to
state the principles and convictions by which I
am actuated and governed in the discharge of
those duties.
Mr. Speaker, I assume, what every fair and
candid mind must admit, and what has been and
will be most fully established in the unerring
lights and facts of our history as a people, that
ail our serious political difficulties, now culmin-
ated in tliis accursed rebellion, have had their
origin, growth,and nourishment in the abnormal
anti-republican system of African slavery, un-
justly forced upon the unwilling colonies by their
"unnatural mother, against the protestations of our
revolutionary sires; and because of which, among
other wrongs and oppressions, they asseited and
won their independence, and transmitted to us,
their descendants, the best country ever vouch-
safed by God to his children, and the most per-
fect system of government ever devised by the
wisdom of man. As slavery can only exist in
palpable vioiatiomof the natural rights of the en-
slaved, and by the exorcise of powers on the part
of the slave-master in constant violation of the
plainest principles of right and justice, it follows
that the system cannot possibly exist in any po-
litical organization founded upon principles ap-
proximating to equality of civil rights, without
continual conflict, collision,and disturbance. Sla-
very may exist peacefully, rank in all its wrongs
and sufferings,in apolitical despotism, sustained
and upheld by absolute, unquestioned power, but
never in a Government in which the popular heart
is permitted to bent responsive to the dictates of
justice and humanity, and a free tongue and a free
press are secure in the discussion of the rignta of
the people, the principles of their Government, and
the duties and responsibilities of Us officers.
Slavery being in itself wrong, can, as a system,
only be secure in wrong government; being con-
trary to natural right and justice, it knows no
laws but those of aggression and force; being in
the habitual exercise of despotic power over an
inferior racc, itleams to despise and disregard the
rights of all races. Living in luxuriant idleness
upon the unrequited toil of others, it regards all
manual labor as base and ignoble. AH along our
histoiy we see the antagonism between free labor
and slave labor, between the slave States and the
free States. While the free States have been pas-
sive and yielding, content with the blessings of
free labor, the slave States have been exacting and
aggressive, seeking and holding almost contin-
ually political ascendency in the Government. As
the and sands of the desert slowly and surely
advance upon the surrounding verdure, cursing it
with desolation, until stayed by natural or artifi-
cial barritiis, so slavery extends us chains and
blight over free institutions and free soil, unless
restrained by human laws of prohibition, or God's
deciees written upon the snow-clad mountains.
Notwithstanding this "irrepressible conflict,"
we have, as a nation and a people, attained a de-
gree of power and prosperity never before reached
by any nation or any people in so short a time;
but day by day, as we grew, while the expanding
blossoms of human intellect and human industry
were multiplying and ripening year by year into
the rich fruits of peace and happiness; while our
commerce was expanding into gigantic propor-
tions, and our daring keels were plowing each
ocean, sea, and river, laden with the productions
of our soil or the results of our skill and industry;
while the mighty West, "the granary of the
world," was producing untold millions of golden
cereals and sending it forth to feed or curse the
nations, as they called for bread or whisky—the
extremes of good and evil—while our manufac-
tures, directed by the genius, intelligence, and en-
ergy of free laboi, were springing forward with
youthful vigor, and successfully contending in the
markets of the world; while, obedient to the
" open sesame" of the hardy miner, the sterile
earth was openingits unwilling doors and yielding
up its rich primeval hoards; while the centripetal
forces of steam and electricity, as applied to rail-
road and telegraph, were welding us together in
iron bands of mutual interest, and wires flashing
with human thought; even while cotton was king,
and the nation was thus prosperous and happy,
reposing with fancied security in the pleasant
orchardsof peace, this accursed monster, this alien
ingrate—the slave power—was pouring into the
open portals of its life " the leprous distillment,"
the concentrated poisons of secession and rebel-
lion. While the nation's breast was being con-
stantly, ofttimes needlessly, wantonly bared, to
the amazement of the world and our own shame,
that this insatiate Jew might relentlessly exact
the " pound offlesh"as " nominated in thebond
nay, more ! while yielding to the hard conditions
of the contract, extorted under new and most
repulsive forms and proceedings, we, in the most
servile and cowardly manner, permitted this polit-
ical Caliban, not only to occupy and prostitute
the seats of power, honor, and emolument in the
land, but to openly and wantonly violate all con-
tracts, all compromises, all decency. The pub-
lic Treasury was repeatedly prostituted to the
purchase of foreign tenitory for the aggrandize-
ment of slavery and the perpetuation of its power.
By fiaud and brute force, regardless of the plighted
faith of the nation, the defenseless, semi-civilized
Indians were cheated and driven from their lands,
their homes, and the graves of their fathers, into
the wilderness beyond the Mississippi, that the
coffers of the slaveholder might be increased by
the enforced labor of the more docile negro. By
threats and arrogance the nation was badgered
into a " compromise," by which the principle and
policy of prohibition of slavery in the national
domain as held and practiced by " the fatheis of
the Republic," was abandoned, and slavery ob-
tained all it then deemed necessary for its pur-
poses. By political jugglery and wrongan unjust
war was precipitated upon a sister republic, by
which she was despoiled of her territory, and that
territory, by indirection, received into the Union
as a slave State, with stipulations that four other
States might be formed within its borders, for the
sole purpose that slavery might obtain and retain
political ascendency in the Senate. And having
clasped within its incestuous embrace the virgin
plains and prairies secured to it by the Missouri
compromise, with unprecedented perfidy and po-
litical bribery it smote down that enactment that
it might curse and forever bind with its clanking
chains the territory thereby dedicated to freedom.
The slave power has evaded and violated, or
sought to evade and violate, every provision of the
Constitution which stood in the way of its unhal-
lowed lust for power and aggrandizement, and
pei verted and distorted all its provisions, by which
slavery was ■permitted under the local State laws,
into original, absolute rights created in and by the
Constitution, and therefore entitled to special pro-
tection thereby, wherever its broad cegis might
extend. It has abridged the right of petition, and
sought its abrogation when directed against its
vile pretensions; violated the public mails; denied
and prevented the freedom of speech and of the
press; imprisoned, maltreated, and murdered
American citizens without trial or form of law;
sought to abridge the freedom of debate in the
House and Senate by rude threats, cowardly as-
saults, and the barbarous duel; prostituted, de-
bauched , and destroyed two great political parties;
permitted and encouraged vonality and corruption
in public office; encouraged and protected tho pi-
ratical slave trade; stalked into the halls of public
justice, assumed the judicial ermine, and, with
unbandaged eyes and broken scales, enunciated
opinions and recorded decrees alike disgraceful
to civilization and subversive of well-established
law; and under color thereof procured infamous
legislation and diabolic executive ordois and de-
crees, whereby rapine, arson, and red-handed
murder were let loose upon the devoted plains of
Kansas; and originated, organized, and nourished
.a vast conspiracy by which it might subvert the
Constitution, overthrow the Government, and
usurp despotic power, whenever free labor should
dare to assert its rights and power through the
prescribed forms of law.
Thus plethoric in sin, audacious in power, mad
with rage at its defeat in Kansas, and trembling
with fear before the earnest indignation of the peo-
ple, but sustained and upheld by a corrupt and
infamous Administration, slavery was for the first
time in our history to be brought face to face in
deadly conflict, upon issues clear and distinct, and
evidence drawn from its own record and acts, with
free labor before freedom's peaceful arbiter, in the
presidential election of1860. From this contest sla-
very shrank in conscious guilt and weakness, and at
once prepared to perpetiate the crowning act of its
iniquity—the denouement of the great conspiracy.
To-day, in the light of recent events, we behold with
amazement the vast extent and perfect organiza-
tion of that conspiracy, and shuddering at the nar-
row escape and rejoicing in the miraculous salva-
tion of the nation, bow down in adoration and awe
before that Almighty wisdom which protects the
just in their weakness and confounds the wicked
in their strength. The conspirators were in places
of trustand powerthroughoutthe Federal Govern-
ment, in tho House and in the Senate, in the Army
and in the Navy,in the court and in the Cabinet,
in the Capitol and in the Executive Mansion. In
most of the slaveholding States they were in al-
most undisputed power, legislative and executive;
and in the free States," sitting at the receipt of cus-
toms," and in other places of Federal trust were
many men wearing the secret livery of the conspir-
ators, who, for their treachery and treason, were
to receive new lease of ofnee under the assassins
of constitutional liberty.
In pursuance of their purposes they withdrew
from the Charleston convention, leaving those
who were willing to concede to them all their
rights, more than their rights, under the Consti-
tution, that they might, by misrepresentation and
falsehood, more effectually deceive the southern
masses and lash them into fury against the entire
North, except only the few who should adhere to
the new organization, and, through subsidized
presses and traitorous cabals, increase their dis-
content, and promise them aid and sympathy.
Then,in quick succession, followed the transfer of
arms and munitions of war from the North to the
South; withdrawal of the military forces to dis-
tant posts, and our naval vessels to distant seas;
secession of States by the usurping conspirators
against the will of the people thereof; seizure of
forts, arsenals, and navy-yards; robbery of the
Treasury and mints;'withdrawal of traitors and
conspiiators, in unmolested ostentation, from the
Halls of Congress; the weak, semi-traitorous pol-
icy of the late Executive, (only saved passively
on the side of his own Government by the energy,
firmness, and patriotism of the present Secretary
of War, and those who cooperated with him in
the Cabinet;) the retirement of the foiled and
defeated conspirators from the Cabinet; the at-
tempted assassination of the President elect in the
city of Baltimore; the inauguration of President
Lincoln, and the retirement of—Miss Lane from the
Executive Mansion. Then followed the days of
active preparation on the part of the conspirators,
and apparent paralysis on the part of the Govern-
ment, until fire was opened upon the starving gar-
rison of Sumter, the capital menaced by the armed
rebels, and patriot blood sprinkled upon the pave-
ments of a rebellious city. Then the great heart
of the nation was struck and vibrated with strange
emotion, and in a day, by the transforming spirit
of patriotism, we became a nation of warriors.
Parties, politicians, and pro-slavery rebel sympa-
thizers in the North were swept away before the
burning indignation of the people, and the mighty
hosts of freedom stood united in deadly array
against the armed cohorts of slavery—the Gov-
