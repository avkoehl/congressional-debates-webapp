JACKSON, December 31, 1862-10.45 a. m.

Lieutenant_General PEMBERTON:

General Johnston thinks I may go home for a few days.

Will give directions for expedition at once.

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.

JACKSON, December 31, 1862.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON, Vicksburg:

The movement you direct General Van Dorn to make will require, he says, a week, and prevent the use to which you applied it. I intended to add to his command Forrest and Roddey. Would not infantry from Grenada serve your purpose better?

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

JACKSON, December 31, 1862.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON, Vicksburg:

I wish Van Dorn, with his cavalry, Forrest's and Roddey's, to prevent Grant's advance. Your ordered will make that impossible. Will not infantry from General better? They can join you sooner, and cannot keep back Grant. They are too far for that. Replay quick.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

JACKSON, December 31, 1862.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON, Vicksburg:

A dispatch was sent before the one in cipher. Cavalry will be more valuable in the northern part of the State; infantry more useful about Snyder's Mill. Infantry from General can get there before cavalry.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
