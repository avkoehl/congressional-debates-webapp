THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr. BROOKS. As it is too late to act on
the bill at this session, I move that it be re-
committed to the Committee of Ways and
Means and printed.
The motion was agreed to.
ORDER 03? BUSINESS.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I have a
little pension bill here, to which I suppose
there will be no objection. I ask that it may
be now considered.
Mr. SCIIENCK. I object. I believe I am
entitled to the floor.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Then I
object.
Mr. RANDALL. To what?
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. To any
other business than the regular order.
Mr. SCHENCK. I have agreed to yield
five minutes of my time to the gentleman from
Illinois, [Mr. Marshall.]
Mr. MAYNARD. Will the gentleman yield
to me for a moment?
Mr. SCHENCK. Very well.
Mr. MAYNARD. I have a bill here which
was introduced by the gentleman from Illinois
[Mr. Farnswohth] and referred to the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means. I have been
directed by that committee to report the bill to
the House with an amendment in the nature
of a substitute. I suppose there will be no
objection to it. The bill is House bill No. 443,
to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to
refund to the Illinois Iron and Bolt Company
cerlain penalties wrongfully collected.
Mr. RANDALL. Let the substitute be read.
The substitute was read. It, authorizes the
Secretary of the Treasury to examine a judg-
ment by confession rendered on the 2d day
of October, 1805, in the circuit court of the
northern district of Illinois, against the Illi-
nois Iron and Bolt Company, for $3,500 pen-
alties for certain alleged violation of the in-
ternal revenue laws, and to refund to the
company so much of the amount paid into the
Treasury of the United States as upon invest-
igation he may think it right and proper under
the circumstances of the case to remit.
Mr. MAYNARD. The law would author-
ize the Secretary of the Treasury to do what
this substitute authorizes, except for the fact
that this money has already been covered into
the Treasury.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I object
to anything but the regular order of business.
Mr. MAYNARD. Very well; I have no
interest in the bill. It is one introduced by
the gentleman's own colleague, [Mr. Farns-
wobtii.]
FUNDING TIIB NATIONAL DECT.
The House resumed the consideration of
the bill (S. No. 207) for funding the national
debt, and for the conversion of the notes of
the United States, upon which Mr. Suhexck
was entitled to the floor.
Mr. SCHENCK. L yield for five minutes to
the gentleman from Illinois, [Mr. Marshall.]
Mr. MARSHALL submitted some remarks.
[See Appendix.]
Mr. SCHENCK. I now yield five minutes
to the gentleman from New Hampshire, [Mr.
Bex-con.]

Mr. BROOKS. I hope the gentleman will
explain what the Senate have added on.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. A million
and a half for rivers and harbors instead of
the river and harbor bill of $7,000,000.
Mr. BROOKS. What is the amount of the
bill now ?
_ Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Three mil-
lion five hundred thousand.
Mr. RANDALL. Have they placed the
river and harbor bill beyond resurrection for
this session?
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Yes, sir.
Willi the passage of this bill it is beyond resur-
rection for this session, and I hope for evfery
session.
Mr. RANDALL. I join you in that.
Mr. EfctGLESTON. I understand this
$1,500,000 is not to bo used for any other
works than those named in the river and har-
bor bill which passed this House.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. That is
tho proviso to the amendment.
The report was adopted.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I move
to reconsider the vote by which the report was
adopted ; and before moving to lay that motion
on tho table I desire to say a word.
Mr. Speaker, I am glad to say to the House
that the deficiency bill jnst passed is the last
of the approj>riation bills, and the public can
now figure up the entire amount of the money
appropriated by Congress for the next fiscal
year. The bills had been considered with the
greatest care by the Appropriation Committees
of both Houses, and I think there are less ob-
jectionable items in the bills than there has
been for many years. The expenditures have
been largely cut down and a great teal of
vicious legislation that has crept in during the
war has been purged from the statute-books.
And I can say, too, that the bills are all through
in good season and at a period anterior to the
time of fixing the day of final adjournment.
That is a matter, I believe, unprecedented in
ihe history of the legislation of the House,
formerly the most of the large appropriation
bills were rushed through at the very last hours
of the session and in the most hurried and con-
fused manner, but few of the members having
any idea of what they contained.
As to the amount of the appropriations for
the present year there is the fixed sum for
interest on the public debt, for pensions, and
for bounties, in the aggregate amounting to
SI 00,000,000. That amount cannot be less-
ened. It is the ordinary expense for carrying
on all the operations of the Government for
the present fiscal year that this Congress is
responsible for, and the people will demand to
know what they are. They will not reach
more than one hundred and two millions, and
that will be against seventy millions in gold
coin in the administration of Mr. Buchanan.
Considering all things, the increase of popu-
lation, the natural increase of expenditures,
the increased prices that eveiything the Gov-
ernment has to buy, I believe the comparison
is a most favorable one, and the fact will forever
stand out to the credit of this Congress. The
estimates of expenditure for this year sent in by
the present Democratic Administration were
SÂ«"2,000,000, including all interest on public
debt, pensions, aud bounties ; but the entire
amount appropriated by this Republican Con-
gress, including such interest, bounties, and
pensions, will not amount to more than y292,-
OOQ.OOO, a difference of $80,000,000 in favor
of Congress. With these appropriation bills
through, and without thrusting upon the coun-
try the schemes of robbery and plunder with
which we are threatened, and which are now
lying in wait, if we should now promptly ad-
journ and go home we will be welcomed by our
constituents as faithful public servants.
Mr. RANDALL. The Republicans are re-
sponsible for this Administration.
Mr. NIBLACK. I wish to ask a question.
Mr. WASHBURN15, of Illinois. I move
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
'^Mr. BROOKS. After making his speech
