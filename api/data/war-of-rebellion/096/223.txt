CITY POINT, VA., January 24, 1865.

Honorable G. V. FOX,

Assistant Secretary of the Navy:

If the rebel rams do not come down to-night I thin everything will be safe before to-morrow night. I expect but little assistance, however, in case of an attack, from the navy under Captain Parker. I have been compelled to take the matter in my own hands to get vessels to the front, ordering by direction of the Secretary of the Navy. I know no reason why the torpedo-boat did not attack. As I understood the rebel rams ran our batteries to the obstruction, and then leisurely removed and blew them up, only opposed by a little infantry from the shore. When I sent up before daylight Captain Parker had removed the monitor to below the pontoon bridge. To-night I understand he has hauled down the river, leaving what obstructions still remain to be removed without opposition from him. I have sent an urgent appeal for him to go back. I have been busy all day getting up material to renew the obstructions, and army officers are now at it.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., January 24, 1865-8 p. m.

(Received 8.10 p. m.)

Honorable G. V. Fox,

Assistant Secretary of the Navy:

Until all is secure here I cannot leave for Wilmington. It will be Thursday morning at the earliest before I can leave.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., January 24, 1865-6 p. m.

Honorable GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy:

I have been unable to get Captain Parker, by requesting, to assemble his gun-boats near the obstructions in James River; he seems helpless. I have now request that you will sustain this course. Please direct during present emergency my orders be obeyed.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., January 24, 1865.

Honorable G. WELLES, Secretary of the Navy:

I would respectfully call your attention to the fact that the rebels are now at work on a formidable ram in the Roanoke River at a place known as Rainbow Bluff. This ram they expect to complete within the next five or six weeks. It is hardly necessary for me to call your attention to the disaster that be caused by allowing this vessel to get in commission against anything we now have afloat in Albemarle Sound. I would respectfully suggest that one of the monitors now no longer of use with Admiral Porter be worked though Hatteras Inlet, and, in addition, the ram Albemarle be raised and repaired for use.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
