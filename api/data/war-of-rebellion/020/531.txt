HDQRS. DEPT. OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA, Charleston, S. C., June 1, 1862.

Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,Secretary of War:

SIR: The work of obstructing the harbor and other water approaches to this city is very much impeded by the want of funds to pay the workmen and defray their current expenses. I have made temporary arrangements to borrow money for this purpose from the Bank of Charleston, but must earnestly beg that immediate arrangements be made by the Department to provide the necessary funds. I understand there is in the hands of the assistant treasurer here $100,000 subject to the order of Captain [now Colonel] Ives, late chief engineer of this department. This money can only be drawn on his order. I request that it be made subject to draft by Captain Francis D. Lee, Engineer Corps, Provisional Army of the Confederate States. Of this $100,000 say $60,000, I understand, is already due for services rendered and material purchased. There should be not less than $100,000 at the disposal of Captain Lee, as disbursing officer for the Engineer Department. I send Mr. James Manigault, of South Carolina, to see you personally on the subject.

Very respectfully,

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA, Charleston, S. C., June 1, 1862.

Colonel W. R. BOGGS, Engineer Officer:

COLONEL: I am directed by Major-General Pemberton to say that he prefers Fort Gadsden, or just below it, as a site, with the guns from Ricco's Bluff, to any other point on the river. He has no guns that he can spare you. He would advise that the obstructions be placed near the guns-say 600 or 700 yards from the guns.

I am, &amp;c.,J. R. WADDY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A., Richmond, June 2, 1862.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.
