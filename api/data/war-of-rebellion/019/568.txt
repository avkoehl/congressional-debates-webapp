SPRINGFIELD, August 14, 1862.

Brigadier General JOHN M. SCHOFIELD:

I have anticipated that the movement of Rains and Coffee may have been for the purpose of drawing off the troops from Springfield, and have held my forces to meet any intended movement from the south. If Colonel King had followed Rains or Colonel Salomon moved to my support the force sent was ample for the purpose, but Montgomery seems to be left to fight his way out. He will render a good account of himself, but I fear will be overpowered. I shall try and concentrate the forces of King and Montgomery. If I succeed the force will be sufficient to hold the enemy in check. Colonel Clark Wright is ordered to Greenfield to take command. Cavalry reconnaissances have been ordered into Arkansas.

I have sent to Montgomery to retire to Greenfield, where I will support him. King's conduct is spoken of as dastardly. Other bands from Arkansas are coming into the southwest.
