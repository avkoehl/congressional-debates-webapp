report of Major Gibbons, inspector field transportation, herewith sent. The frequent calls for horses from that army, varying in number at different times, induced me to send Colonel A. H. Cole, chief inspector of field transportation, directly to General Johnston, that every possible assistance might be given in supplying his wants, and he is still there. I am informed that officers have been dispatched to all the sources of supply within reach to add to the large number already furnished General Johnston, as shown by Major Gibbons' report. All reports from General Jonston's army show that they have been better supplies with forage during the past winter than any other portion of our forces in the field, and the stock ought, therefore, to be in better condition.

Respectfully submitted.

A. R. LAWTON,

Quartermaster-General.
