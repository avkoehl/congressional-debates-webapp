General JUDAH,Commanding U. S. Forces, Kingston, Ga.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to submit the following item of news which I have just received from an intelligent U. S. soldier, who has been for some time a prisoner. His name is Michael Lightener, Fifty-fourth Pennsylvania Infantry. This soldier left Washington, Ga., day before yesterday at 4 p.m., and arrived here at 12 m. to-day. He states that Jefferson Davis was at Washington, Ga., on the 3rd, and that he [Davis] left that point at 12 m. of the same day. Said soldier fell in with Davis and his cavalry at the Catawba river, N. C., at the railroad crossing, where Davis remained two days. He then marched in company with them for three days, passing through Chesterville, Abbeville, and thence to Washington. He represents Generals Bragg and Breckinridge in company; also Wheeler's cavalry, 1,500 strong. The cavalry refused to go farther unless paid, whereupon they were paid $30 each in gold, with the promise of $100 each when they should cross the Mississippi River. He is supposed to have $15,000,000 in coin, and wagons, perhaps fifty. I have no mounted men here as yet, but will have my regiment to-morrow evening.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. B. EGGLESTON,

Colonel First Ohio Cavalry, Commanding Post.
