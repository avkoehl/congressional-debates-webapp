the power of making rules and regulations gov-
erning this small craft. The ostensible scheme of
this bill is to provide for the safety of passengers
on steam vessels. These tugs, tow-boats, and
freight-boats do not carry passengers. Interference
with them cannot, therefore, be conducive to the
alleged purpose of this bill. By the proposed
enactment, Congress will subject them to a new
and different inspection, and their owners to new
expenditures; but I think to no useful purpose.
Under the provisions of the act of 1852, the in-
spectors appointed thereunder are authorized to
examine and license all pilots of steamers carrying
■passengers; and by the tenth section of the act it
is declared unlawful for any person to employ, or
any person to serve, as pilot on any such steamer,
who is not licensed by the inspectors.
By the thirty-first section of the act the pilot is
required to pay to the inspectors, (for the use of
the ¥nited States, as I understand the bill,) for then-
license, the sum of five dollars upon the granting,
and the further sum of one dollar for each renewal
of the certificate of license.
This seems a trifling tax; but I am unable to
discover any sound reason why Congress should
prohibit the owner of a steam-tug or freight-boat
not carrying passengers, plying about our harbors,
from selecting himself the pilot or engineer to
whose care he sees fit to intrust the management
of his business, and to whose prudence he sub-
jects the safe-keeping of his property. I am quite
unable to appreciate the wisdom of the policy
which would impose such restrictions upon this
petty commerce.
I have prepared and submit a statement of the
increased expense of the execution of this pro-
posed law, over and above that of the act of 1852:

This increased expenditure would not, in my
judgment, be a sufficient objection to this bill, if
its provisions were really efficacious for the pur-
pose of saving the lives of those who go down
upon the sea.
But there arc several important changes in our
navigation laws proposed by this bill, in respect
of which I ask the attention of the members of
the House. They are entitled to grave consider-
ation, unless it is our policy to strike a blow at
our navigation interests.
The sections of the bill numbered ten, eleven,
twelve, thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen, relate ex-
clusively to steamers navigating the ocean on
routes exceeding four hundred miles in length.
Each of those sections is cither vitally wrong or
requires substantial amendment.
Section thirteen proposes a change in the ex-
isting laws so important as to entitle it to special
attention. It is in the following words:
And be it further enacted, That no passenger-steamor,
embiaccd within the eleventh section of this act, shall be
pemutted to carry more than one person, exclusive of offi-
cers and crew, to eveiy three and one half tons of lawful
tonnage measurement.
This provision is new. The tonnage standard
as to passenger restriction on occan steamers is
hco tons under the existing law of 1855. Now,
why has the honorable gentleman from Illinois,
or whoever framed this bill, selected three and
one half tons as the standard of measurement?
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I will, Mr.
Speaker 
Mr. CLARK, of New York. I do not require
an answer now.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I supposed
if the gentleman asked me a question, he desired
an answer, and would allow me to give it.
Mr. CLARK, of New York. I inquired of the
gentleman yesterday why he had fixed upon three
and a half tons as the standard of restriction, and
I understood him to answer that such was the
passenger lestriction under the law of England.
Now, sir, as I understand the provisions of the
act of Parliament, this bill restricts the number of
passengers which an American steamship may
carry to a less number than a British steamer of
similar tonnage is permitted to take.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I have the
law of the British Parliament before me.
Mr. CLARK, of New York. What is the date
of it?
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. 1855.
Mr. CLARK, of New York. 1 have a copy
of the English "passenger act of 1855" before
me, and by that act, it appears to me that a Brit-
ish steamer would not be prohibited from carry-
ing twice the number of passengers to which an
American steamer will be restricted, if this bill
shall become a law. Why should this be?
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I hope the
gentleman will prove his propositions as he goes
along. I think the gentleman is in error on that
point.
Mr. CLARK, of New York. Bear in mind
that at this time we have no law of the United
States restricting the number of passengers which
a steamship may carry, except the act of March
3, 1855, which prohibits any sea-going ship or
steamer from taking on board at any foreign port
a greater number of passengers that in proportion
of one statute adult to every two tons. This act
of 1855 is our law of the ocean passenger carry-
ing trade to-day. If I am in error, I hope that the
gentleman from Illinois will correct me. This act
does not, it is true, regulate the passenger trade
by the tonnage standard exclusively. Nor does
the law of England; nor, as I understand it, does
the Uw of any other of the commercial nations.
Our act of 1855, as well as the act of Parliament
of 1855, prescribes the space of clear superficial
feet of deck in the different parts of the ships
which shall be appropriated to the use of the pas-
sengers, and restricts the number to be carried in
proportion to the prescribed space, as well as in
proportion to tonnage.
The law of England limits the number of pas-
sengers on the upper passenger-deck to the pro-
portion of fifteen clear superficial feet, and on the
lower deck to the proportion of eighteen super-
ficial feet. r
The act of Congress of 1855 limits-the number
on the upper passenger-deck to the .proportion of
sixteen clear superficial feet, and on the lower
deck to tht! proportion of eighteen cl^ar super-
ficial feet. In respect of the spacc restriction as to
upper-dcck passengers, the law of England is more
liberal to the carrier than our own. In respect to
the tonnage restriction, the law of England is the
same as that of the act of Congress of 1855. Now,
I do not understand that the thirteenth section of
this proposed bill repeals the space requisition of
our act of 1855. Its effect is to increase the ton-
nage restriction seventy-five per cent., and, of
course, to reduce the passenger-carrying capacity
of the ship in corresponding proportion.
The tonnage measurement of a steamship, un-
der the rule prescribed by the laws of the United
States, is not a test of her passenger-carrying ca-
pacity. Our statute rule for the measurement of
tonnage was made in 1799. It is to be found in
the sixty-fourth section of the act regulating the
collection of duties on imports and tonnage,
(March 2, 1799,) and is as follows:
" Sec. 64. And be it further enai ted. That to ascertain the
tonnage ot'any ship or vessel,the surveyor, or such other per-
son as shall be appointed by the collector of the district to
measuic the same, shall, if the said ship or vessel be double
decked, take the length thereof from the fore part ofthe main
stem to the after pai t of the stern post, above the upper deck,
tile breadth thereof at the broadest part above the main wales,
half of winch breadth shall tie accounted the depth of such
vessel, and shall then deduct from the length, three fifths
of the breadth, multiply the remainder by the breadth, and
the product b\ the depth, and shall divide tins last product
by ninety-five, tiie quotient whereof shall be deemed the
true contents 01 tonnage of t-lich ship or vessel. And if such
ship or vessel be single decked, the said surveyor or other
peison, shall take the length and bieadth as above directed
in respect to a double decked ship or vessel, shall deduct
irom the said length three fifths oi the breadth, and taking
the depth from the under side of the deck plank to the ceil-
ing In the hold, shall multiply and divide, as aforesaid, and
the quotient shall be deemed the tonnage of such ship or
vessel."
This was of course before the, era of steam nav-
igation. The rule of measurement would seem to
l°e an arbitrary one; certainly in no wise adapted
to the determination of the quantum of passenger
accommodations of a steamer. The business of
passenger transportation, now so important a de-
partment of commerce, has, in fact, sprung into life
since the establishment of the rule of 1799; and it
would seem somewhat singular, in view ofthegreat
changes which have since taken place in the con-
struction of ships and of the introduction of a now
motive power upon the sea, requiring a structure of
vessel entirely different from that for the measure-
mentof which the rule was designed, that the stat-
ute prescribing the mode of measurement should
have remained to this time unchanged.
The part of the steamship which is measured
for the purpose of the ascertainment of her tonnage
tinder the act of 1799, is not the part of the ship
where all the passengers are carried. The space
above the working-deck, in which, on board steam-
ships, great numbers of passengers are carried, is
not measured at all under our system of tonnage
measurement. Oilier countries have different rules
of measurement. England adoptsa rule dissimilar
to ours, and France has, X think, a rule peculiar to
herself. I believe that there is a bill now pending
before this House establishing a new system for
the measurement of steamships and other vessels.
I am not aware of any particular advantage which
will result to our maritime interest from a change
in our system; though I am not advised of any
well-founded objection to the establishment of a
rule of measurement by which the actual carrying
capacity shall be ascertained. Our ships are now
measured in the ports of Europe m accordance
with European rules for the purpose of determin-
ing the amount of tonnage, light, and other dues
payable by them; and hence I see no substantial
advantage in further adherence to our plan of ad-'
measurement. Eut, if our rule of tonnage meas-
urement is to undergo a change, it is exceedingly
important that we should know what is to be its
descriptionbefore we adopttonnageas the standard
of passenger-carrying restriction; otherwise our
ship-owners cannotknowtheextentofthedangers
m store for them.
