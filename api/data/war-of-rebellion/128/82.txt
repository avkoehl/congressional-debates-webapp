The SENATE OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES:

Under the first clause of the sixth article of the Constitution, I entertain doubt whether it is intended that the officers either of the Regular or Provisional Army or of the Navy, appointed during the existence of the Provisional Government and confirmed by the Congress, require to be renominated and confirmed by the Senate, and I respectfully request your advise on this point.
