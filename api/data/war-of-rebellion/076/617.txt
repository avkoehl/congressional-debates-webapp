Major-General SHERMAN:

Having ascertained that there is a force of about 1,200 rebels five miles southwest of Stilesborough I placed 1,000 infantry and 400 cavalry under General McCook's orders. He moved out at 3 this a . m.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, near Atlanta, August 20, 1864-9.15 p. m.

General JOHN E. SMITH,Cartersville:

The force you describe as about Stilesborough is Clanton's, from the neighborhood of Talladega. General Vandever's cavalry is after it. Head it off and if possible capture it. It is a very indifferent force, that General Rousseau drove with great ease. It was doubtless ordered to co-operate with Wheeler and is behind time.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
