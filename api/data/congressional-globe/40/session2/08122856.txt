I. John Russell, Secretary of State of the Stato of
Ohio, do hereby certify that the foregoing is a true
copy of a joint resolution therein named, adopted by
tlie Oencrai Assembly of the State ot Ohio on tho
lGrb day of May. A. D. 1868, taken from tbe original
roils on file in this office.
In testimony whereof! have hereunto subscribed
r, my name and affixed tbe ^cal of thi- office, at
Columbus, the 23d day of May, A. D. 18GS.
JOHN RUSSELL,
Secretary of State.
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. Mr. Speaker,
I introduced a bill some weeks since, which
wasreferre 1 to the proper committee, to author-
ize an enlargement of the Miami and Erie
canal so as to make a ship-canal from Cincin-
nati to Toledo, thus connecting the waters of the
Ohio and the Mississippi with the great lakes.
If this should be done, as it will be done sooner
or later, Cincinnati, Toledo, and the cities of
my district will have most if not all of the
advantages of the sea-board cities. Ships will
fo directly from Cincinnati by way of Troy,
'equa, and-Toledo through the great lakes out
to the ocean and to all the ports of the world.
That this work will be made is one of the cer-
taintiesof the future. It is only a question of
time. Forty years ago no one could have fore-
seen the completion of our stupendous canals,
railroads, and other improvements, and in the
near future we will realize the completion of a
ship-canal, not only on the route proposed,
but on one less important but more discussed
from Chicago by way of Joliet to La Salle, so as
to connect Chicago with the Mississippi river.
The House has this day passed a bill giving
two hundred thousand acres of land in Minne-
sota to build a darn across the Mississippi.
That may be important to the interests of
commerce, but not so much so as the proposed
ship-canal. I move the reference of the pre-
amble and'resolution I have presented to the
Committee on Commerce, and that they be
printed.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. HOOPER, of Massachusetts. I move
that the House now adjourn.
The motion was agreed to ; and accordingly
(at ten o'clock and ten minutes p. m.) the
House adjourned.
PETITIONS, ETC.
The following petitions, &c., were presented
under the rule, and referred to the appropri-
ate committees:
By ilr. BROOMALL: The petitions of
15 manufacturing linns of Chester and Dela-
ware counties, in the State of Pennsylvania,
employing, when in lull operation, 324 work-
men, now employing 174 workmen, represent-
ing that the productive interests of the country
'are suffering for want of efficient protection
against the cheaper capital and labor of foreign
countries; that tbe customs duties, which,
under a high gold premium, were sufficient to
create and foster manufactures, are now wholly
inadequate, and, in prospect of a continued
decline in gold, must shortly prove ruinous;
that much.of the distress now prevailing would
be relieved by the legislation suggested in Spe-
cial Commissioner Well's report of last year,
