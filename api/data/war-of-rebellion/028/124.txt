since I was informed the enemy had driven my pickets 1 mile from Gaines' Cross-Roads. I have sent a regiment to support them, and regain the dross-roads.

It is evident the move to-day was to place themselves between us and the roads leading from the gaps, through which their produce trains are passing. Two regiments of infantry (rebel) were seen to-day acting with Stuart. They probably had more.

I shall feel these roads to-morrow, leading toward Woodville, and wish to know the general's instructions in reference to them.

Very respectfully,

A. PLEASONTON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major-General PARKE.

P. S. - Captured 2 prisoners - 1 infantry and 1 cavalryman.

CORBIN'S CROSS-ROADS,

November 11, 1862 - 5.30 p. m.

GENERAL: A dispatch just received from Barbee's Cross-Roads informs me that 600 rebel cavalry entered Sandy Hook yesterday; that the Seventh Virginia Regiment is within 2 miles of Markham, and that Jackson is expected to march down the Grade road to-day. The Grade road is the road to Culpeper, and the demonstration of yesterday was evidently intended to cover some such movement, as well as to reconnoiter. Colonel Davis, of Eighth New York, at Newby's Cross-Roads, reports he has scouted all the roads leading from that point to-day, and found no enemy, except at Hazel Rived, where he captured a sergeant, of Longstreet's body-guard, and 2 horses. Pickets on the Culpeper road report the rebels, with two regiments of cavalry and two pieces of artillery, on the opposite bank of Hazel River. They have been reconnoitering toward Jefferson to-day. My loss yesterday was 2 men mortally wounded and 2 severely.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. PLEASONTON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major-General PARKE.

CORBIN'S CROSS-ROADS,

November 11, 1862 - 9.30 p. m.

GENERAL: I send you inclosed a Lynchburg paper of yesterday, which shows the rebels are using the railroad in that direction. It remarks on the large number of desertions of the rebel army.

A deserter from the Eighth Virginia Infantry came in this morning; left Culpeper Saturday. Says Lee has gone to Richmond. That he was impressed into service from Tennessee with 40 others, all anxious to quit the rebel service when they can get away. Captain Hutton has communicated the general's views, and I will do everything to carry them out.

Please order me 100,000 rounds of Sharps' carbine cartridges, with caps, and have them sent to me as soon as possible. My cavalry, in this country, act a great deal on foot, and must have the ammunition.

Very respectfully,

A. PLEASONTON,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General PARKE.
