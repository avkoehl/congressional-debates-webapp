RICHMOND, October [September] 7, 1863.

His Excellency Governor BONHAM:

Dispatch received, and arrangements made to comply with your request for veterans.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

CHARLESTON, S. C., September 7, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

The evacuation of Morris Island leaves the enemy free to employ a part of his forces against the lines on James Island. These lines are being shortened and strengthened. The enemy may attempt to get possession of the northeast end of Sullivan's Island, with a vies to the reduction of Moultrie. Our greatest want is additional troops to man the existing works and those under construction. I hope some additional brigades, under good commanders, can be spared to meet re-enforcement sent to the besiegers.

J. F. GILMER,

Major-General, and Second in Command.

CHARLESTON, S. C., September 7, 1863-8 p. m.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector-General, Richmond, Va.:

Those 210 sailors are still much needed for night communication with Sumter and Sullivan's Island, and for harbor guard-boats.

Admiral Dahlgreen demanded to-day surrender of Sumter. I replied to take it if he could.

Ironsides and six monitors opened this afternoon on Moultrie, result not yet known, but I fear little from their guns afloat for Sullivan's Island batteries.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CHARLESTON, S. C., September 7, 1863.

Major S. ELLIOTT, JR., Commanding Fort Sumter:

Inform Admiral Dahlgren that he may have Fort Sumter when he can taken and hold it; that such demands are puerile and unbecoming; also that no further flags of truce will be receive from him or General Gillmore until they satisfactory explain their firing on flags of truce from these headquarters on several recent occasions.

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., September 7, 1863.

D. B. HARRIS,

Lieutenant-Colonel, and Chief Engineer:

COLONEL: The battery at Mount Pleasant you will please have arranged as soon as possible for two guns, the second gun being an 8-inch columbiad, which will be transferred there from Fort Moultrie.
