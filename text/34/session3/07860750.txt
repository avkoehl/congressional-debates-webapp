home demand. Consequently its price must be
regulated by the piice of the foreign article, with
the duty added. The home supply is not only lim-
ited in amount, but it is necessarily local in its pro-
duction. And for this limited and local interest
we are now paying from three to five cents tax per
pound for our whole supply of sugar. I have
never known a tariff for protection advocated on
the ground that it was right to foster interests
which are merely local, and never can be other
than local, and even then insufficient for home
supply. I do not know that any interest in Ohio,
or any interest in Maine, ever sought protection
in this country, when it was alone the interest
of Ohio, or alone the interest of Maine. [Here
the hammer fell.] I regret that I have not time to
show other more cogent reasons for this amend-
ment.
Mr, TAYLOR. I have listened to the remarks
. of the gentleman from Ohio, and 1 still think that
•he labors under a strange misapprehension. It
Is true, that owing to the fact that an ad valorem
duty is imposed on sugar, and m consequence of
the inereasc of pricc in the Island of Cuba conse-
quent on a diminution of the crops there for the
last two years, the duty on sugar is now not far
from three cents per pound. We should have
preferred that there should have been a specific
duty, but it was thought otherwise by the Con-
gress of the United States. And that particular
result grows out of the fact that the price of sugar
has increased m Cuba, not because of any changes
that have taken place here. Now, as I do not in tend
to discuss this question at all, I will merely call
the attention of die committee to the pi ices of
sugar which have prevailed at different periods.
By a reference to a paper prepared m 1854 by Mr.
Edmond J. Forstail, of Louisiana, from papers m
the Library of Congress, and which I now hold
in my hand, the following was stated to have been
the prices of sugar in New York from 1815 to
1831:

And by reference to another table, prepared by
the same gentleman, and printed in Mr. Secretaiy
Walker's report in 184(>, at page 7.00, the prices of
sugar in Louisiana, on plantation, and in Havana,
as compared with each other for certain years,
will be found as follows:
Louisiana fair. Havana hrorm.
1832-33.. 5# to 5% cents. 1832 to 3% cents.
1833-34.. G to 7 « 1633 i>>4 to

1842-43., Z% to 4 «
1843-44.. 5# to 6 i£ "
1844-45.. 2% to 4% "
And late in the spring of 184.5 the price rose to
5^4 cents.
In 1852-53,1853-54, and 1854-55, the prices of
sugar m Louisiana ranged lower than in the years
1841-42 and 1842-43, and were sometimes down
to two and three cents. The shortness of the
crops in Cuba for the two past years caused
prices to raise there; and the diminution in the
crops of Louisiana, during the same time, added
to that rise until ir reached its maximum during
the last autumn and the present winter, because
of the small croo of last year. If the price of
sugar in Now Orleans is at nine and ten cents, it
has gone up to from six and a hafrf to eight 8nd
a half cents in Cuba, as any one may see who
looks into the price currents. These recent fail-
ures of crops are similar to the failures in the
crops in Cuba and in Louisiana in 1834 and 1835,
.and they have now produced, the same effect in
prices which those failures did then.
And, now, let me ask, why has the price of
sugar diminished steadily from 1815 to the present
time? Has the increased production been- the
cause of it; and if so, has not the increased pro-
duction in Louisiana had anything to do with it?
It is true, that since 1815 the production of sugar in
Cuba has increased in such a manner that it is five
times as great now as then; but is it not equally
true, that the crop of Louisiana has become fifteen
times greater than it was in 1815 and 1816 ? Those
who desire to know this can refer to_page!91 of
the Compendium of the Census of 1850.
Mr. BLISS demanded tellers on his amend-
ment.
Tellers were ordered; and Messrs. Korton* of
Ohio, and Haven, were appointed.
The committee divided; and the tellers reported
—ayes thirty-one, noes not counted.
So the amendment was disagreed to.
Mr. WAKEMAN. lofferthefollowingamend-
ment:
Secj. 4. Jlwl he it further enacted, That from and after
thp 3 ft day of July, 1857, the duty on Manilla hemp, unman- I
ufactured, shall bo fifteen per cent, ad valorem.
Mr. Chairman, I ask the attention of the com-
mittee for a few moments, while I submit some
remarks on this subject. It is a subject which
deeply concerns my constituents, and I feel a
responsibility resting upon me to bring the prop-
osition I have submitted to the attention of this
House. The amendment proposes simply to
reduce the duty upon Manilla hemp. Manilla
hemp is not an article which comes into competi-
tion with any produced or manufactured in.this
country. Manilla is the fibrous portion of a
banana tree which grows in the Philippine Isl-
ands, and is extensively used by the commercial
and navigation interests of our country for run-
ning ringing for shipping. It was used last year
by my constituents to the amount of $2,250,000.
I state that fact to show that it is not an article
which comes into competition with the hemp
mised either in Kentucky or Missouri; and that
fact was conceded by the distinguished gentleman
who occupies the chair, [Mr. H. Marshall,] a
few day* ^ince,and thogentleman from Missouri,
[Mr. I\ knnt.tt.] It is notan article which comes
into competition with any article we produce. It
is purely a foreign production, which is largely
used by our navigation and commercial interests.
Allow me to say further, sir, that Manilla hemp
is admitted duty free by the British Government.
The people of Cheat Britain are not taxed for that
hemp; while my constituents, who are engaged
in the commercial interests of this country to the
extent of 1,500,000 tons, are required to pay a tax
of thirty per cent, on the raw material; whereas
upon cordage, the rope and rigging for our ships, m
we are only compelled to pay twenty and twenty- 'j
five per cent. I submit, then, to the chairman ,|
of the Committee of Ways and Means, and to
this committee, whether n is right to tax the raw
material higher than the manufactured article?
It is a direct discrimination against the manufac-
turer in this country. I yubmit that it is a rea-
sonable reduction to put the duty upon Manilla
hemp down to fifteen percent, ad valorem. 1 do
not include Russian or other hemp, but simply
confine my amendment to Manilla hemp.
Mr. KENNETT. Mr. Chairman, the gentle-
man from New York has certainly misconstrued
both your position and mine in regard to this sub-
ject of Manilla hemp. Although it is true, as
stated by that gentleman, that the hemp of our
own country does not come into competition with
that used for the running rigging of vessels, yet '
| it is well known that Manilla hemp is fast taking . j
the place of the home product for coverings of .t
cotton bales, and many other articles in the'man- m
ufacture of which hemp is used. It is coming so j
far in competition that it is well known in your ■ I
eoun^r, Mr. Chairman, many rope and bagging ;
i factories have had to stop woik. The gentleman
says that his constituents have to pay Unity per
cent, duty upon Russian hemp. Now, if he will ,|
examine the tables, he will find that Russian '{
hemp is no longer impoited. if
Mr. WAKEMAN". The gentleman is mis- ij
taken. j:
Mr. KENNETT. The total amount of Rus- ']
sian hemp imported into the country in the
year 1855 was only $57,000 worth, while the
amount of Manilla hemp and its manufactures
was ^,250,000. So that it is the Manilla hemp*
in some shape, that the hemp-growers have to
fear, and not the Russian and other foreign hemp.
But if the gentleman is desirous to have the duty
increased upon the manufactured article to thirty-
five or forty per cent., and leave thirty per cent,
upon foreign hemp, I not only have no objection,
but will aid him in thus affording protection to
our own manufacturers.
Mr. WAKEMAN. I ask for tellers upon my
amendment?
Tellers were not ordered.
The amendment was not agreed to.
Mr. FAULKNER. I offer the followingamend-
ment as an additional section:
Sec. 3. JlrtA be it further enacted, That from anil after tha
first day of July, 1857, there shall be a reduction of thirty-
three and one third per cent, of the duties now imposed by
law on the goods, wares, and merchandise, other than those
above enumerated, imported from foieign commies, and
enumerated and provided for in the act entitled u An act
reducing the duty on impoits, and for other purposes,''ap-
proved July 30, 184d.
-Mr. Chairman, it is manifest that my amend-
ment reducing the existing rate of duties thirty-
three and one third per cent, was designed as a
substitute for the entire bill now before the com-
mittee. In other words, it was intended to super-
sede all other legislation upon that subject during
the present session of Congress. 1 regret that
the amendment could not come before the com-
mittee in that form, so as to test the sense of the
committee between my proposition and that of
the chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means. Being precluded by the rules of order
from offering it in the form of a substitute, I am
induced, by the earnest request of gentlemen
around me, to modify it, and offer it as dn addi-
tional section to the bill now pending; which bill,
however, very greatly enlarges the list of free
articles, and which of course must vary the results
which might otherwise be expected from my
amendment if adopted as a substitute for" that
bill.
Mr. Chairman, I have very little expectation
that any bill changing the general arrangement
of the tariff of 1846 will becomc a law during the
: present session of Congress. I admit that there
are imperfections in the details of the present
tariff which should be remedied. Apart from
some errors of detail in its original fiamework,
tune has worked changes m the commercial and
manufacturing interests of the country, to which
we should adapt our legislation. Still, I do not
think that we have before us the materials for
discreet and considerate action at this time. The
tanlf of 184G has been longer in successful opera-
tion,--arid has given more general satisfaction to
all the varied interests of the country than any law
on the same subject which has ever passed Con-
gress. 1 am not disposed to disturb its general
arrangements without the most mature examina-
tion of the interests involved. I think that con-
sideration has not been given to the subject during
the present Congress. I am therefore in favor,
foi the present, of letaiuing the tariff of 184(j af 
the basis of action, and simply reducing the rates
of duties so as to diminish the revenue—which has
now grown so far beyond a proper standard of
expenditure—and which surplus, annually accu-
mulating, must derange the whole monetary con-
cerns and business of the country. My propo-
sition, in its original design, was therefore to
retain the existing tariff, with all its schedules and
classifications, modifying it only by a reduction
of thirty-three and a third per cent, on the duties
nosv;.prescribed by law. It appears from the re-
port of the Secretary of the Treasury, now before
me, that the receipts from customs during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1S5G, was $84,022,863 50;
one third of this amount will give a reduction of
$21,340,954 50, which, with the fund arising
from the public lands, would raise a revenue of
$52,000,000, a sum far more than sufficient for
the frugal and economical administration of the
Government, with all its vast and multiplied in-
terests and subjects of expenditure.
Mr. CRAWFORD. As a substitute for the
bill, your amendment meets my views precisely.
"Rut is not the reduction of thirty-three and a third
per cent, too great with the enlarged free list?
Mr. FAULKNER. By a reduction of the du-
ties one third it does not necessarily follow that
the revenue will be reduced one third. On the con-
trary, the probabilities aie that importations may
be stimulated, and the revenue will rise beyond
