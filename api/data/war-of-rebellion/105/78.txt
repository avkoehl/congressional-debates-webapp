of flour with the brand of Cooper's Mills, with quite a quantity of empty sacks, 5 mill files, a piece of belting, 40 or 50 pistol bullets, some lead, a powder flask, bullet pouch, 2 bullet molds, fish nets, spear heads, some deer skins, and some 13 large baskets, besides small ones which I did not count, the most of which property I destroyed, not being able to carry it away. It was very mortifying to me that they should elude my grasp, but upon an examination of the ground it was easily accounted for. The Indians were sitting down about 250 yards from where we entered the open ground, whilst they had their spies in such positions that it was almost impossible for any enemy unacquainted with the ground to get a shot at them. From their number (from fifty to sixty) and the stories that were told by citizens about the Indians desiring to fight the white men, I was led to the belief that we should get a fight. We encamped that night at some old rancherias about a quarter of a mile in the timber to the east of the open ground. In the morning we again endeavored to obtain some trace of the Indians by which we could follow them up, but in vain. We then took up our march in a northerly direction over the ridge, through heavy redwood timber and thick brush, without being able to see any more sign than a place by a large redwood where an Indian family had slept some months since. We traveled about four miles and reached our camp. The day following camp was broken up. The command marched over to the Weaverville and Eel River trail, passing through a thousand-acre field, and camped at Ross' ranch, on the trail, about one mile above Large's. April 9, camped at Reed's ranch. April 10, scouted through the timber on the south side of South Yager, down to where the Indians had crossed on the 6th, then took a southerly course, coming out on the Weaverville trail about three miles to the west of Reed's, arriving in camp about 5 p. m. No Indian sign whatever, except that made on the 6th. From Reed's we proceeded to Grizzly Gulch. Scouted through there without seeing any fresh sign. From Grizzly Gulch marched to the Middle Fork of the Yager. Scouted over some fifteen miles of the neighborhood to the eastward and northward without being able to discover any Indians or Indian sign in the vicinity. On the morning of the 13th took up the march for Fort Baker, arriving there at 5 p. m.

FORT BAKER, CAL., April 27, 1862.

SIR: I have the honor to report my return to the post this afternoon from a successful scout. We have killed 3 Indians and 1 squaw (who was mistaken for a buck), and have 24 prisoners, big and little, amongst them two boys, respectively sixteen and eighteen years of age, who were found secreted after the firing ceased, and were without weapons. If it meet the views of the colonel commanding, I would respectfully request that their lives be spared, as it will be likely to have a tendency to induce others to surrender. I will forward a more detailed account in the course of a day or two.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOS. E. KETCHAM,

Captain, Third Infantry California Vols., Commanding Fort Baker.
