Brigadier General WESLEY MERRITT,

Commanding First Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: Brigadier-General Averell has informed me, through one of his scouts, that he expected to be in Martinsburg at 3 p.m. to-day. He was then within a mile or two of the place, and it was reported unoccupied by the enemy. Send out at early dawn parties in the direction of Bunker Hill, if it is possible for them to get through and ascertain whether or not the enemy's infantry are moving or have gone toward Winchester. General Averell's scouts say that from all the information they could obtain the rebels were moving up the Valley. Prompt information from you early in the day may save my infantry columns heavy marches.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
