HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF LITTLE ROCK,Little Rock, Ark., August 4, 1864.

General CYRUS BUSSEY:

GENERAL: The brigadier-general commanding directs that you relieve the Third Missouri Cavalry from outpost duty by another regiment in order that they may move.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. E. GRAVES,

Captain and Acting Aide-de-Camp.

DEVALL'S BLUFF, ARK,. August 4, 1864.- 11 a.m.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Little Rock:

Captain Goodykoontz has returned from Hickory Plains, where he arrived at 2 p.m. yesterday. Only squads of from five to twenty men had been in Hickory Plains. Two days ago McCray, with about 2,000 men, was camped at Gum Spring. On Saturday he passed, with his full force, through Austin. No signs of Shelby in that direction. Think we ought to move against McCray.

C. C. ANDREWS.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

(Same to Generals Steele and West.)
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF LITTLE ROCK,Little Rock, Ark., August 4, 1864.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS.

Commanding Post of Devall's Bluff:

It is proposed to move after McCray. You will send your available cavalry force to Searcy or West Point, with ten days' rations part in wagons. You will relieve the Eleventh Missouri Cavalry by a regiment of infantry. A cavalry force will move from here toward Searcy.

By order of Brigadier General E. A. Carr:

S. E. GRAVES.

Captain and Acting Aide-de-Camp.

DEVALL'S BLUFF, August 4, 1864,.

(Received 12.30 p.m.)

Captain C. H. DYER:

I can move 1,400 or 1,500 cavalry from here. By sending 500 or 800 from Little Rock to Austin, to move from there contemporaneously with movement from here, then sending force from here of 500 to go to Hickory Plains and joining force from Little Rock, occupying fords above Searcy, and move down toward West Point, sending 1,000 to ford Bayou Des Arc, near mouth of Cypress Bayou, I think McCray could be badly punished.

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General
