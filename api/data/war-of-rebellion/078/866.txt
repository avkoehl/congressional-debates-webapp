PALMETTO, September 23, 1864.

Brigadier-General IVERSON,

Commanding Cavalry:

In answer to your note of this morning, General Hood directs me to inform you that should the enemy press you from the direction of Atlanta you will retire, if forced back, in direction of Griffin, endeavoring at the same time to send small parties to the enemy's rear to interfere with his trains and ascertain his numbers and probable intention. Should a raid move you will pursue it with your principal force, leaving sufficient behind to do picket duty and report to headquarters. Should a raid move which you deem too formidable for your force to defeat a brigade will be sent from the other wing of the army to your assistance.
