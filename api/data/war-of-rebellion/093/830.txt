MAX MEADOWS, December 18, 1864.

Mr. Robinson, reliable men at lead mines, says when Vaughn was there he declared his inability to defend them, and advised the people to pack up and leave. When Yankees got there, boat was on other side, and they offered $500 to any one who would bring it over; nobody responded. Twenty-five effected a crossing and burned the place. In Bristol, Yankees burned depot, round-house, and one train.

WYTHEVILLE, December 19, 1864-2 p. m.

MAJOR: We have been worrying for several hours with telegraph and cannot get a message through. Walked from Max Meadows this morning. A courier is just in from General Breckinridge, and reports that he met the enemy two miles this side of Marion yesterday; fought and drove them twice. A column was on each of his flanks, and he was almost out ammunition. He sent no written dispatch, but I know the courier well (Hiram Rogers). The general told him to state that he was nearly out of ammunition, and that he would like to have it as soon as possible. He will be near Mount Airy to-night. About 500 men were left at Saltville. General Echols is which General Breckinridge all right; Withcher, Duke; Giltner, and Cosby are all with him. Enemy had four pieces of artillery. They did not carry off any of the artillery captured from Vaughn and Gillespied, but spiked all the pieces and left them. You will see the necessity of at once sending troops forward. Saltville may be besieged at any hour, and troops must go to its relief. Ammunition should be sent up at once. Trains can come three miles this side of Max Medows. For God's sake get this line to working if the fault is at your end. We will do all can to accomplice it here. Rogers says the loss on our side at Marion was slight. Stoneman
