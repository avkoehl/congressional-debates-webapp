Blacksburg here, which but for the heavy rains would have [been] made in four days. I subsisted on the country the greater part of the way; found but little subsistence in the counties of Monroe and Greenbrier. On arrival here many of our men were barefoot, and we were almost entirely out of provisions, consequently had to send to Gauley after supplies.

Brigadier General W. W. Averell deserves particular mention for his severe and perilous marches and his encounter with the enemy at the different points. (For particulars see his report.)

I cannot close this report without expressing my sincere thanks to the brigade and regimental commanders for their hearty co-operation, cheerful obedience to orders, and preservance of that harmony in their commands which is so essential to the success of any expedition.

I cannot speak in too high terms of my personal staff, viz, Major B. M. Skinner, Ninth Virginia Volunteers, acting assistant inspector-general; Major W. P. Rucker, Thirteenth Virginia Volunteers, acting aide-de-camp; Captain James L. Bostford, assistant adjutant-general; Captain James Allen, Second Virginia Cavalry, provost-marshal; First Lieuts. B. H. Moore and J. N. Patton, aides-de-camp; Second Lieutenant C. S. Roberts, assistant commissary of musters, and G. K. Smith, telegraph operator, for their personal bravery on the battle-field in carrying orders and for assisting in rallying and encouraging our men during the action at different points. Captain John R. Craig, assistant quartermaster, for untiring energy and skill in managing the train; Lieutenant Frank M. Slade, Twelfth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, ordnance officer, for strict attention to his duty;Surg. George M. Kellog, medical director, for his untiring energy and attention to the wounded and sick.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE CROOK,

Brigadier-General.

Captain T. MELVIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
