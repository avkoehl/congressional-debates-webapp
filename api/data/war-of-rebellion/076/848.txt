FLORENCE, ALA., September 10, 1864-12 m.

Captain EDWIN E. WOODMAN:

SIR: I arrived here at 11 o'clock, after driving the rear guard of Johnson's army, about 150 strong, in and through the town, and dispatched to that effect. Since then from reports that I have learned and all the information I can gather the enemy were busy crossing the river by ferry at the mouth of Cypress Creek all last night. I have scouted the country above and below, and am confident that Johnson's entire force has crossed the river. Citizens report that Wheeler has crossed a portion of his force, and is now crossing the remainder of his men at two different fords below the mouth of Cypress Creek. Colonel Spalding having reached this place with orders to halt and feed, I have done the same, and am now waiting further orders. I have just sent a scouting party out to go as far as Cypress Ferry with orders, if possible, to take possession of boats. Will be governed by circumstances.

Respectfully, yours,

GEO. W. JACKSON,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

FLORENCE, ALA., September 10, 1864-2.30 p.m.

Brigadier General EDWARD McCOOK:

The enemy cannot be found; they are supposed to be at Pride's Ferry, ten miles below Florence. I will send flag of truce if I can find the whereabouts of Wheeler.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. SPALDING,

Commanding Division.
