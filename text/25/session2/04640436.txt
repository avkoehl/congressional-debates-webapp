operations of the pre-emption, the Miami reserve
in the State of Indiana, acquired by treaty, of
which the proclamation was made by the Presi-
dent of the United States on the 22d of December
last
Mr BOON then rose and addressed the House as
follows
Mr Chairman, said he, the subject under consi-
deration was one of very deep interest to a nume-
rous and most meritorious class of citizens* of the
new States and Territories, and that he, as a mem-
ber of the Committee on Public Lands, and as a
Western man, felt it to be his duty to offer a few
i cmarks in support of the measure proposed to be
adapted. In thedischargeofthe duty thus devolved
upon me, said Mr. B I shall at least have the sa-
tisfaction to know that I shall be found laboring to
protect the rights and interests of a class of my fel-
low-citizens, many of whom have removed far
from the land of their fathers, m search of a coun-
try and a home for themselves and families, and
have settled on the public lands in good faith and
with an honest intention of becoming the purchasers
of then little improvements, so soon as circumstan-
ces would enable them to do so. And now, sir,
what does the present bill propose to do'' It con-
tains no new principle whatever, but simply pro-
vides that there shall be granted to the present set-
tlers on the public lands that which, by former acts
of Congress, has been repeatedly granted to othei s
who were similaily situated
I am aware, Mr Chairman, that many gentle-
men of the old thirteen States of this Confederacy
are, and ever have been, opposed to almost every
meisure calculated to benefit the new States of the
West But, said Mr B I had not, or could not
have, believed, until very recently, that there could
be found an individual of any political creed what-
ever, hailing from the Great West, ready to de-
nounce all those who had at any time settled on the
public lands, as a band of " lawless intruders and
land ¡urates " But, sir, a most meritorious class of
citizens of the new States have been thus grossly
denounced by men high in office, and from a quar-
ter, too, from whence so hostile an attack upon
western men and western interests was least to
have been expected or looked for, and though I
will not descend to the use of language of like un-
statesmanlike character by way of retort, I may
be permitted to say that I know hundreds
and thousands of individuals who at different
periods of time settled upon the public lands
before they became purchasers thereof, whose
characters for honesty, integrity, and patrio-
tism would not suffer by a faithful comparison with
that of any individual who may, at any time, have
thus denounced a meritorious class of citizens, to
whom the country at large, and the West m parti-
cular, is under the deepest and most lastirg obliga-
t on^, a class of citizens, sir, whose spirit for enter-
prise is unequalled, and whose manly courage has
never been surpassed In the hour of their country's
danger from an invading foe I rejoice, said Mr
B to know that m our heaven-favored America, a
J> eeman is neither disfranchised m consequence of
his poverty, nor m consequence of his having set-
tled upon the public lands, and I trust, sir, that
every despised and abused settler upon the Go-
\ eminent lands will, on all fit and proper occasions,
cause his just weight and influence to be felt and
íespected by all aspirants to office Sir, said Mr B
to what class of citizens do we look for soldiers to
fight the battles of our common country? Is it to
the land speculators, the rich, and the " well born,"
that we look? No, sir, no it is to the laboring poor
men of the country, including the abused settlers
upon the public lands, who have been denounced
within the v. alls of this Capitel, on mo e than one
occasion, as a band of " lawle  intruders and land
pirates " And, sir, shall we now refuse to protect
this meritorious class of our fellow citizens in their
just claims upon the favor of the Government un-
der which they live'   I trust not, Mr Chairman
Sir, if j ou but trace the history of the new States
and Teintones from their earliest settlement by
a white population up «> the present period of
time, it will be perceived that much the greater
portion of the entire population of those States and
Territories, settled upon the public lands before
they became purchasers, and it is to this descrip-
tion of population, more than to any other, that the
Government is mainly indebted for the value that
has been given to your vast public domain. But
for the spirit of enterprise displayed by the adven-
turous sons of the West, much the greater portion
of the now cultivated regions west of the moun-
tains, would, until the present period of time, have
remained in a state of nature, and the habitation of
the aborigines, and beasts of prey
Sir, continued Mr. B. having been myself a
partaker of the many privations m life which at-
tend those who are the settlers of a new country, I
feel that I am thereby enabled to judge more cor-
rectly of the many privations which is experienced
by those who, at different periods of time, have set-
tled upon the public lands in the Western wilds.
Twenty-seven years ago, sir, I removed from the
State of Kentucky to the then Tgrntory of Indiana,
with a wife and four small children, and being at
that time unable to make payment for a lot of land
for a home for myself and family, I, like many
others, settled upon the public lands with good
intentions, when my nearest neighbor was a hos-
tile Indian, and my only shelter from the storm,
and my protection from danger, was an open camp,
and the bark of the elm tree when spread upon
the cold earth served both as my floor and my car-
pet And, for more than five long years, the meal
of which my daily bread was made I had to grind
on a hand mill Such, Mr Chanman, are a few
of the very many hardships which were experienced
by the early settlers in the western wilds, and such
are they who, on more than one occasion, have
been denounced within the walls of this Capitol as
a band of "lawleis intruders and land pirates " Sir,
continued Mr B. all that I will say to those indi-
viduals, who have thus given utterance to such
course and unmerited abuse of a meritorious class
of American citizens, is that they deserve only, as
they will teceive, the utter scorn and contempt of
every individual who at any time has seltlsd upon
the public lands.
Some gentlemen arc opposed to pre-emption
laws, because, say they, such a policy if adopted,
would so far change the present land system, as to
greatly dimmish the annual amount of revenue
now receivable from public lands. Now if gentle-
men Wid but examine this subject a little better,
they will readily perceive that land sales, at public
auction, since 1820, have, on an average, produced
only about six and one quarter of a cent per acre
more than the Government price of one dollar and
twenty-five cents per acre
Now, Mr Chairman, I put it to gentlemen to say
whether they leally consider the pecuniary interest
of the Government m this small matter, involving
only the trifling sum of six and one-fourth cents
an acre more than the present Government price,
of such importance, as to induce the Government
to drive from the public lands, the present settleis,
for the purpose of enriching the Treasury, and to
benefit the speculator? Sir, suppose you refuse to
protect the actual settler by pre-emption right, what
are the consequences which will follow' Why,
sir, the poor settler will attend the public land sales,
and bid for the lot which has been made valuable,
and perhaps saleable, only by his labor, until
driven from competition by a mere man of straw,
procured to bid at the public land sales by a com-
bmation of speculators And when the actual set-
tlers are thus driven from the sales, this man of
straw thus procured to bid against the settlers, for-
feits his bids, the land reverts back to Government
for non-payment of the purchase money, and is
then entered by the speculator at one dollar and
twenty-five cents per acre This, sir, is, to a very
considerable extent, the effect predueed by the pre-
sent system of land at public auction The
Government, under such a system, is no gainer,
while the poor settler loses his all, and is after-
wards compelled to content himself with the pur-
(¡Itase of Government lands of an inferior quality,
of"he must purchase better lands from the specula-
tor at greatly advanced prices
Surely, Mr Chairman, it will not be contended
by any, one that it would be either a wise or judi-
cious policy on the part of the Government to adept
any systr i that would have a tcn^o -    t   Tipple
or retard the growth or improvement of the new
States, and more especially when the Government
would be no gainer by the measure. No, sir it
should rather be the policy of the Government to
sell her lands to individuals in tracts of limited
parcels, ana at reduced prices. The pnce that has
been long fixed by law as the Government price
per acre, is one dollar and twenty-five cents, and is
believed to be sufficiently high for any lands sold
by the Government; and it cannot, in 3ustice, be
denied that the actual settler and cultivator should
have a preference over the speculator. If j ou
grant the right of pre-emption to actual settlers to
one quarter section, as is proposed by the present
bill, the Government will receive one dollar and
twenty-five cents per acre for all the lands sold un-
der the present land system at private entry; and if
you first offer your lands for sale at public auction,
the Government will receive but a small fraction
more on the acre, than the minimum Government
price. But not even that fraction will be received,
where combinations exist, and but few public land
sales have taken place of late years, where combi-
nations by speculators did not exist. I consider,
therefore, that the Government has no adequate
pecuniary interest sufficient to induce it to drive
from the pubhc lands the actual settler, for the be-
nefit of the speculator
I am aware, said Mr B that pre-emption laws
have been objected to on the ground that they in-
volve conflicting claims and clashing interests, and
other evil consequences This was the case under
the act which authorized loafing' claims But, sir,
the present bill guards against like consequences in
future It provides that where two or more per-
sons have settled upon, and cultivated any one
quarter section of land, each of them shall have an
equal share therein, but shall have no claim to
lands elsewhere by virtue of this bill, should it be-
come a law
These, Mr Chairman, are the general provisions
of the present bill, as it came from the Senate, and
having received the approval of a majority of the
Public Land committee on the part of this House.
Sir, said Mr B if time would permit me, I might
go much more at length into the discussion of this
subject, but I am not much in the practice of
making speeches on this floor "lor Buncombe," and
knowing that there is other business of much im-
portance to the country and to individuals to be
acted upon m the short time yet remaining of the
present session of Congress, I will conclude my re-
marks by saying that, to my muid, there is no mea-
sure whatever which recommends itself more
strongly to the favor of Congress, upon every prin-
ciple of justice and humanity, towards a meritorious
class of our fellow-citizens, who have settled in the
western wilds
Mr EWING said he would not make a speech
for Buncombe nor for the House, nor should he
enter into a history of his life, for, when he gave
that, he should give it entire. He spoke highly of
the character of the squatters, and referred to an
alleged attack made upon them elsewhere by an
individual, [Mr Clav,] which he pronounced
false, and said such an attack had never been
made.
Mr E moved to amend the amendment by
granting to the State the right of pre-emption to the
Miami reserve lands, except to those already set-
tled, which he stated to be only by about half a
dozen families
Mr CHAPMAN inquired if the amendment,
which proposed to give a State a grant of land
was in order He hoped the gentleman would
withdraw it, and bring it forward upon some other
occasion, as it had the effect of embarrassing the
bill
Mr EWING said it was intimately connected
with pre-emption rights to public lands, and the
disposition to be made of them, and was so inti-
mately connected that they could not be separated.
Mr HEROD called for a division of the ques
tion on Mr Ewing's amendment, so as to take
the question first on that branch of it giving the
pre-emption to the State, and next on that in re-
lation to the individual settlers on the Miami
lands
Mr   JOHNSfJN of Louisiana remarked that
