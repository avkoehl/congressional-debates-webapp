both officers and men, which shows plainly the hard work they have done. My brigade has been successful in every undertaking, except on the 27th of June. Colonel Dickerman, One hundred and third Illinois; Lieutenant-Colonel Barnhill, Fortieth Illinois; Major Giesy, Forty-sixth Ohio; Major Ennis, Sixth Iowa, and Major Heath, Forty-sixth Ohio,all of whom were the very best of officers, were killed while leading their regiments. Lieutenant-Colonel Wright, Major Willison, and Captain Post, One hundred and third Illinois; Lieutenant-Colonel Miller, Sixth Iowa, and Major Hall, Fortieth Illinois, were each severely wounded while in command of their respective regiments, making in all 10 field officers killed and wounded while engaged in battle. The officers of the line have also suffered severely. But with all this, they have never hesitated to perform any duty assigned them. All deserve the highest praise for the cheerfulness with which they have performed their part in this arduous campaign. The Twenty-sixth Illinois, and the One hundredth Indiana have but recently been assigned to my command, and I can but speak of them in the highest terms, for their bravery and endurance.

I would be doing injustice to brave and faithful officers did I close this report without calling the attention of the general commanding to my staff-Captain Upon, Captain Watson, Lieutenants Johnson, Davidson, Collis, and Parsons, all have done their duty nobly, never hesitating to go where danger was thickest.
