CAMP BEAUREGARD, February 10, 1862.

Major-General POLK,

Headquarters First Division, Western Department:

I have just received a dispatch from Lieutenant-Colonel Miller, dated six miles east of Paris, 12 m. yesterday, in which I am directed to send a messenger to you informing you of the condition of the command at this place and also his condition. He states he need cooking utensils, tents, &amp;c.; that he had received dispatches from you, and that nothing was said about the time he should return. Upon the subject of his return he wished information. My own and Captain Clay's companies were detailed to remain here in charge of this encampment in the absence of Colonel Miller. A portion of Major King's command, numbering about sixty men, including the sick, ten men from Captain Stock's company, and a few others were also left. The number of effective men remaining here does not exceed 150, including a portion of Major King's battalion, not armed. All the baggage, camp equipage, commissary, and quartermater's stores are still remaining here. Lieutenant-Colonel gives me no orders in his dispatch, and says he does not know what disposition you may make of the force remaining here. He further states that the bridge over the Tennessee River was burned on the night of the 8th instant; that the enemy with their gunboats and 500 men were there; 2,000 infantry and 600 cavalry occupy the banks of the river opposite Fort Henry, with two pieces of artillery.

Everything quiet between here and Paducah, so far as I am informed.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. A. PINSON,

Captain, Commanding Post.

BOWLING GREEN, February 11, 1862.

General FLOYD:

I give you full authority to make all the dispositions of your troops for the defense of Fort Donelson, Clarksville, and the Cumberland you may think proper. Acknowledge receipt of this.

A. S. JOHNSTON.

BOWLING GREEN, February 11, 1862.

Brigadier-General FLOYD:

Twice to-day I have telegraphed to you to command all the troops and use your judgment. Your report of the effect of our shot at Henry should encourage the troops and insure our success. If [at] the long range we could do so much damage, with the necessary short range on the Cumberland [we] should destroy their boats.

A. S. JOHNSTON.
