Mr HOWARD explained that this bill had been
rcpoitcd by the Comm ttee on Foreran Affairs in
consenuence of the difficulty of amending the
Senate's bill m such manner as to meet the views
of the members of the House. He trusted that this
bill would be more acceptable, and hoped that the
Clerk vv ould read it by sections, so that the amend-
ments if anj, might be proposed in regular order to
the bill
The first section being read,
Mr UNDERWOOD moved to strike out the
vords which authorized the President to release
goodo which may be taken in certain cases
Mr U stated the reason why he moved this
amendment to be, to piohibit the President from
ac ingin a judical capacity
Mr HOWARD stated that this provision was

sident w as the most (ompetent judge in these cases.
He was fully acquainted with our relations with fo-
reign countries, which made him more competent

If the matter was referred to the courts, there might
be difference of opinion between the judges, m
consequence of the information which was in their
possesion, but the President, having all the infor-
mation, could decide more understandmgly and
properly It was a mere power to relieve property
that had been seized, and might be assimilated to
the pardoning power He trusted, therefore, that
the amendment proposed by the gentleman from
Kentucky would notpieva 1
Mr UNDERWOOD replied, that if it was pro-
posed to give this power to the President in conse-
