Brigadier General M. W. GARY,

Commanding Cavalry Brigade:

General Longstreet desires you to make a line of rifle-pits along the crest of the hill where the work for the battery is overlooking the White Oak Swamp bridge; also to fell every tree which can be made to fall across the road down in the bottom near the bridge. There are two crossing over the swamp between White Oak Bridge and Fisher's Ford - one-half a mile and the other three-quarters of a mile from the bridge. You will direct the logs at these crossings to be piled up and mixed with dry wood and burnt.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
