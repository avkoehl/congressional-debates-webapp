If I was a little stronger, I think I could drive Meade's army under cover of the fortifications of Washington before he gathers more re-enforcements. When he gets all his re-enforcements I may be forced back to Richmond. The blow at Rosecrans should be made promptly, and Longstreet returned.

I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

There is a report that the enemy, 800 strong, cavalry and infantry, breakfasted at Mr. Taylor's, this side of Tazewell Court-House, this morning. I do not know that the authority is good. Please instruct me if you wish the home guards called out, &amp;c.

Major General SAMUEL JONES,

Abingdon:

Your dispatch regarding the enemy just received. Have telegraphed to the commanding officers at Salem, Big Lick, and Christiansburg, also to Dodamead, to furnish transportation to New River Bridge.

Am sending down rations. Scouts are watching the Walker's Creek road and all the other approaches. Lieutenant-Colonel Gardner and Colonel Gray, of Newbern, are stationing the scouts.

I have telegraphed Major Kent, at Wytheville, to keep me advised of any approach in that direction. Riders are out collecting the home guards. Every one seems inclined to respond promptly to the call.
