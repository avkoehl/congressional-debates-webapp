DEAR GENERAL: Yours of 5 p. m. 20th instant is just to hand and read by the general-in-chief, who directs me to say that full instructions have been forwarded you by Colonel Twining, who left us this a. m. Instructions here also been sent General Terry. As yet to-day it is comparatively quiet. The enemy does not seem disposed to persist in his attacks. His losses have been severe, while ours will not overreach 2,000 total.

I am, general, with respect, &amp;c.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NEW BERNE, N. C., March 21, 1865.

Major General J. M. SCHOFIELD:

I have just arrived from Beaufort. Left Wilmington last evening. The boats had returned that I sent eighty miles up Northeast River with supplies for General Terry. He took everything that he could carry. I see everything is confusion at Beaufort. Had I not better return to Wilmington and move my office to New Berne and bring to this point everything that will be of service here, after giving the necessary instructions to my officers at Wilmington? General Easton disires me to bring him 400 good contrabands. I can get them at Wilmington. I would like to see you. Do you desire me to come to the front?

Respectfully,

GEO. S. DODGE,

Bvt. Brigadier General and Chief Quartermaster, Dept. of North Carolina.

Colonel J. W. BARRIGER,

Chief Commissary of Subsistence,

Department of North Carolina, New Berne, N. C.:

COLONEL: I am reliably informed that in the surrounding country within a circuit of twenty-five miles of Wilmington there exists a sufficient quantity of beef-cattle and sheep to subsist the troops in that vicinity for a long time. Owing to the high price of fresh beef and the difficulty in shipping cattle, I would advise that you cause foraging parties to be sent frequently to procure them for the use of the command at Wilmington and vicinity.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. BECKWITH,

Colonel, Aide-de-Camp, and Chief Com. of Sub., Mil. Div. of the Miss.
