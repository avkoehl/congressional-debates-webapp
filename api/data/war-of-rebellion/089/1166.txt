I quote the words in your letter. In my reply to you the following sentence occurs, viz:

The President, desiring that public should not hereafter lose the services of an office whose zeal and gallantry have been so conspicuous as your own, has deemed it better no to ask for your confirmation in the rank of lieutenant-general, in order to leave you in that to which you have been already confirmed, and has directed me to offer to you service as a major-general in the Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.

In considering the above expressions in my letter and comparing then with the terms used in the above quotation from your letter in reply the President can see no necessity for yielding to you wishes in respect to the latter, and therefore declines to accede to your demand. He would scarcely have offered you the command in question if he did not feel confidence in your capacity, gallantry, and fidelity, and does not conceive it is necessary or proper to announce the same in orders.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

Your letter of the 29th of February came by last evening's mail An expression of undiminished confidence was promised me. Relying upon the sacredness of that promise, I came here resolved to disregard all that was faithful to my feelings as a soldier, and try as a patriot to perform my duty in the future as faithfully as in the past. My visit to this place has but confirmed my previous impression that without the fulfillment of the pledge given me no good can result from accepting the position tendered. Influenced, then, by for the public interest, I am constrained to adhere to the determination expressed in my letter of the 23rd of February.

With great respect,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

As my letter of the 4th instant may have miscarried, I repeat tits substance. I stated that, as I had come here upon a distinct and unequivocal promise that an expression of undiminished confidence should be given me, I was constrained to adhere to my determination to decline the position tendered, until the pledge was complied with. I have not yet gone on duty.

With great respect,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.
