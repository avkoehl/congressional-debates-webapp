Interference, in Elections—Mr. Strange.
S&KAT&
idci. than that of a nomengenérale of whatsoever
is odious and detestable to them in politics At
one time, it is agiananism, at another, a geneial
community of every thing, unregulated bylaw, at
a third, hostility to corporations, and atafouith,
it is made to signify a seditious stu ring up of the
people
But the Senatoi doubts whethei he is a compe-
tent judge of Federalism and Locofocoism Now,
I admit, in a philological sense, no man is com-
petent to define Locofocoism, but if it is to be
taken as the pioper name of any political party ¡
>n the country, the Senator is, I think, altogether
too modest m disavowing his competency to speak
of it If there is any tiutn in the maxim, expen-
entia docet, <experience teaches,) the Senator is
unusually well qualified to sp«ak of the parties of
this country and to define them He h is wow-
edly belonged to two, and the evidences uerretty
■stiong that he is now uniting himself to a thud
lie ought, thertfoie, to be well acquainted with
what lies upon the surface of things, palpable to
the eye of any discerning man, and if theie be
any partv seciets or mystenes in any of the par-
ties of this country, they, also, cannot fail to be
known to him who had been initiated into all
But, af er all, these violent assaults upon the
repoit of the committee are not so much to be
wondered at    Ihe rtpoit has been very tiouble-
some to the gentlemen on the other side     It so
far shook the confidence of the Senator who m
tioduced the bill as to induce him to propose an
amendment changing mate nail y its chai actor, and
the Senator from Vngima is for al andonmg the
bill alfogi thct ,and substituting in if?place a string
of leso'utions      A g neial must be much dissat
isfied wi li hit, position who changes it in theface i
of an enemy, but this our adversities ought not
tobe illowed   o do   they have mule an issue be    .
foie the country, and they ought to be required   '
*o n eet it    It is one of the ai tifiees of wai, when
a partv is weak at homt, to ( ndeavor to tiansfer
the beetle o( stufe to the tei rttoiy of the enemy,
and by a similai artifice do the gentlemen seek to
luin away observation Aom the enoi mines of the
bill by diiocting it to the supposed defects in the
lepoit, but to little purpose is it adopted     The
iepoit «caiccly admits of defense, because, m
tiuthjithas no assailable  point     Hie Senatoi
from Virginia is unquestionably a gentleman of
ingenuity and talent, and  has come to the onset
with a lieuty will, if possible, to demolish this
leport,  but cv  ly assault made by him has sig-
nally failed   TIi^ blows w ere dealt with dextenty
enough, bat Jiey weie unaccompanied with the
foiceoftiuth    The bill, on the oth  rhand,i   as
salíanle at evciy position   and wtieashot di-
rected  against eveiy weak point,  it would  be
converted into a perfect riddle—nay, it is uncei- '
tain whethei it wou'd even hang togethei               j
Ihe bill is tounded on a total misconception of
oui institutions and of existing facts It is a mis |
conception petvading the whole Fedeial pjity |l
They stiaugily imagine that there is in the Fed I
eral Constitution a cuie for all the ills of life
No evil can exm but the powers of this Govern
ment ate thought competent to leach it Like
the oriental tent spoken of by the Senator fiom
Missoun, [Mr Benton,] which a man may carry
in his wustcoat pocket, it may yet be spiead forth
so as to cover the aimy of Xeixes This is the
radical error of that party, and from this root
spimgs forth a legion of eirors From this little,
fountain issue large streams conespondentin bit-
terness The gentleman read the Constitution
as a certain personage is said to uttei his piayeis
—backwards So far fiom restricting its action to
the province of granted poweis, they seem to
consider it omnipotent, except so far as its action
is expiessly restricted Instead offorbearing to
exercise Federal power where the right is doubt-
ful, they exert it often wheie it is manifest it does
not legitimately exist This is, as I have said,
their radical political mistake, and from it numer
ous enors have sprung up and overspread the
land Many of these enors have even taken
possession of the Democratic ranks, and insin-
uated then corrupting influences into the puiest
Administration this country has ever seen It is
impossible to associate with bad men and not im-
bibe coi.uption " Evil communications corrupt
good manners," said an inspired man, and thus
No. 12
it is that the Demociatie. politicians, daily asso
ciating with the Fedeiahsts,and often personally
esteeming and admiring the men, become insensi-
bly more oi less tainted with then political here-
sies It is no wonder, then, that we find it diffi-
cult to pieserve the Democratic faith pure and
unadulterated EveivDemocratic Administration
has found moie or less federalism creeping into
Us measures
But even in an unlimited Government it is ac-
knowledged, as a wise iiiaximrthat much legisla
tion ought to be avoided, that no law should pass
until an existing evil, demanding conection, is
apparent, and the remedy pioposed seems likely
to piove efficient, without cieating evils greater
than that it is intended to lemove The bill un-
dei consideration assumes that there is an evil,
and proposes a remedy, and in the assumption
of that evil, exposes one of the most dangerous
and opeiative errors of the whole Opposition
paity, viz that the people and the Government
are foreign to each othei, and may have separate
and distinct interests So much are they dazzled
by Butish glory, and so accustomed are they to
give ciedit to that country for all that we possess,
that they can conceive of no political proposition
wh eh would be true in Bntain and not true in
this country They forget that om Constitution
v, as formed by the people, that it is, in truth, a
mere social compact, and that it is one of the
people who is employed in each office necessary
to give efficiency to the compac, while theBntish
constitution recognizes the king as the fountain
of all honoi and powei,and all the guarantees of
libeity it now contains, consist of concessions
made from time to time by him Here poweis
and authority is entirely official, theie it is per
sonal as well as official Hen powei and author
ity is continually falling back into the common
mass, to be disposed of ancv as it shall deteim
me Theie it has a perpetual existence, sepa
rated fiom the mass of the people, into whose
hands ilea n never fall without a revolution Con-
foandmg things so totally dissimilar, naturally
leads gentlemen into fuither errors They sup
pose that what is an evil in one country must
necessarily be so in anothei where the same state
of things exists, and that the same remedies are
applicable This would be all true, if their first
supposition were not altogether erroneous, but,
being so, all the conclusions drawn from it are
misapplied But of what does the bill complain >
Ofbnbeiy' No' That is not practiced, or proper
punishment for it is alteady provided What,
then, is the evil ' It is stated in the caption of
the bill " A bill to prevent the interference of
ceitain Iideial officers in elections To the end
that the great poweis given to the officers of the
Federal Government, and other personsemployed
in its service, may not be used for the influencing
of elections, which ought to be free and incor-
rupt "
Now, sir, what are those gieat powers given
to Federal officers Can any man point one of
them out' Has the Senatoi in his bill told us
what they are, or indicated even one of them >
To use an expression of the Senator fiom Vil
gima, he has entirely pretermitted them Í deny
then existence They are among the phantoms
which vivid imaginations have of late so fre
quently made to stalk across the political stage,
to frighten men from their propriety It would
have been impossible for the Senator to point out
these great powers to which he alludes, and he
has therefoie taken the moie judicious couise of
assuming their existence as a matter needing no
proof Every man is conscious, in his own ex
penence, of the effect this process has upon the
mmd The use of the simple epithet ■' Cicero
the orator," is much more persuasive to the mmd
tnat Cicero was a gieat and distinguished oiator,
than the most ¡aboied aigument A like course
is pursued in the cons'iuetion of this bill It
assumes as a fret what requires proof, and inge-
niously passing by the fact, states the principle
also m such obscure teims, that the mind is not
a little confused by the semblance of propriety
and its real inconsistency with sound doctrine
No one will deny that if office holders, or any
other persons, endeavor to corrupt the votéis at
an election by babes oi piomises.it would be
grossly crimina!., while at the same time any ar-
gument addressed to their reason and patriotism
would be highly propel If the office-holders use
the foimer, then- acts aie grossly criminal, and
they can douotless be punished by the existing
laws, but against the latter there is not, nor ou™ht
there to be, anv law
The bill assumes that great powers exist in
Federal officers, which are applied unfairly to the
contiol of elections, and this I deny, loto calo.
This assumption of the bill is calculated to give
force and circulation to one of the most dangerous
eirois in public opinion, now becoming too prev-
alent, that office holders and office-seekeis should
be an odious class Why should they be so It is
contrary to practice and opinion m the purest
days of ancient liberty it is contraiy to sound
opinion now The man who devotes himself to
the service of his country is no fit object for con-
tempt If a man seeks offke by base and dishon-
orable means, oi seeks to retain it when obtained,
by any unfair devices, he is a base and dishonest
man, but in the receiving or holding office itself
there is no dishonor He who serves Ins counuy
on the field of battle is honored by all If it could
be ascertained that lie had done so from base and
dishonorable motives, lespect would be with
diawn, and the finger of scoin pointed at him.
But if, in that seivice, it could be discovered that
he was moved by no higher consideration than
" seeking the bubble, reputation, even in the can-
non's mouth," he would be hailed with acclama-
tion And is it for the Amencan people to think,
or say, that he who seeks their favoi by fair and
honoiable means acts unworthily ' That he who
aspires to distinction, by filling the offices which
they confer, is not thereby seeking honoi r It has
been fashionable of late to hold such doctnnes,
and this bill follows up the idea, and endeavois
to widen the guif between the people and their
official agents And why has it become fashion-
able' 1 here are two principal reasons the one
is, that a spirit of avance is abioad throughout
our land, and bending every soul to his sway,
and leveling all distinctions but those which
money can create Wealth ¡s the only true badge
of honor, and as wealth is seldom obtained in
faithful public service, public service has ceased
to be honorable The other leason rs obvious.
Many who desire office are disappointed, and,
like the fox m the fable, cry out "sour grapes,"
while, like the same fox, they are ready enough
to seize upon every cluster that hangs within
their reach.
Sir, public opinion upon this subject is fast
being perverted, and this bill is calculated to con-
tribute greatly to thatpcrveision. In the soundest
days of the Republic, it was an honor to seive the
country in any capacity, and, in the language of
the report, every man who shrunk from it was
deemed an tdiof The man who socks the service
of his country by honorable means, should be
honored There is but one honorable mode of
seeking it, and that is by discharging faithfully
the duties of the station he already fills, and fitting
himself to fill others well when called upon. Let
those who denounce office holders and office seek-
ers lay their hands upon their hearts, and answer
whether they do not desire office, and would not
hold it if they might Not one in a million could
answer in the negative, and those few would be
found mostly among the indolent, the sordid, or
the misanthropic Nothing can be more unfavor-
able to the stability of our institutions than the
opiead of this prejudice against office, which Fed-
eial men and Federal presst sale active m propa-
gating I had the good fortune the other day to
peruse the letter of thecelebiated John Tayloi, of
Caiohne, lately brought to thepublicattention, so
ícplete with instructive mattei Speaking of the
operations of the paper monopoly par<.y, he says,
among other things

acts av wtdlj to erect monarchy, under the pretence ol
restoring o der "
This is precise'y what is now doing, and the
great tendency of the bill under consideration, by
stirring un suspicio i between the people ana their
olleeis.and detaching the confidence of the foimer
frjm men honest seivants This bill rests upon
the basis that the interests of the people and their
