rival of a brigade of the Eleventh Corps, which had marched from Chattanooga on the south bank of the river without being attacked. The march of the column was directed upon the head of Missionary Ridge, the line of battle moving parallel to the river, the left flank resting on the Chickamauga, the right extended into the plain, supported by the brigade of the Eleventh Corps, while Jeff. C. Davis was left behind in reserve. The crest of the ridge was gained without serious opposition or loss, and at 4 o'clock, when I left the ridge, the line extended from the turnpike bridge over the Chickamauga to the tunnel of the Knoxville railroad; the rebels fired only one cannon and displayed but few sharpshooters. On the right of our lines the struggle was more severe, and though 2,000 prisoners were captured, the result was less decisive. General Hooker gained a foothold on the point of Lookout Mountain, but his possession was hotly disputed till after dark. Since then general Palmer has sent him the brigade of General Carlin from Chattanooga, ferrying the men across Chattanooga Creek, and with this re-enforcement the position can probably be held. In the center nothing has been done except by the artillery of the forts. Grant has given orders for a vigorous attack at daybreak by Sherman on the left and Granger in the center, and if Bragg does now withdraw the remainder of his troops we shall probably have a decisive battle. What force he has had in our front to-day is still a matter of question. The prisoners captured on point of Lookout were taken, 1,200 by Woods' division, of the Fifteenth Corps, and 800 by Geary's, of the Twelfth. They are reported to be Stevenson's Vicksburg troops. Sky clear.

No firing at front. This makes it pretty certain Bragg retreated. Palmer's troops had sharp fight with rebels on eastern slope head of Lookout Mountain last night, lasting two hours, until 10 p.m. Full moon made their battle-field as plain to us in this valley as if it were day, the blaze of their camp fires and the flashes of their guns displaying brilliantly their position and the progress of their advance. No report of the result yet received, but probably they got possession of Summertown road. As soon as positively determined Bragg has gone, Granger, with 20,000 men, moved up south bank Tennessee, accompanied by steam-boat bearing supplies, to cut off Longstreet's retreat and relieve Burnside.

CHATTANOOGA, November 25, 1863-9 a.m.

Bragg evacuated summit Lookout Mountain last night and our troops occupy it, but he still holds to his rifle-pits along base Missionary Ridge, and has been moving troops all the morning toward front of Sherman's position in Chickamauga Valley. What force he can mass there still undetermined.
