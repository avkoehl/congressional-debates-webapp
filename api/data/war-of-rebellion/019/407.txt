HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE SOUTHWEST,Batesville, Ark., JUNE 1, 1862.

Brigadier General W. SCOTT KETCHUM, Saint Louis:

GENERAL: I have reliable news from Little Rock and from Texas. Great efforts are making to collect an army at Little Rock. Galveston and Houston forces and those which started for New Mexico are ordered up, and ten Texan regiments have arrived with artillery. Hindman was to start from Corinth on the 28th and all the Arkansas and Missouri troops were to come with him.

If the Corinth hive sends a swarm this way I must concentrate on this side of White River and be re-enforced immediately. The news of the blockade of these rivers is not confirmed,and the reported re-enforcements of Fort Pillow and the arrival of the rebel gunboats, which remain at Little Rock and Des Are, is evidence of a design to fall back upon.

Has the occupation of Corinth or the efforts of our gunboats frustrated this design? The enemy is moving; we must be on the alert. I have spread my force to hold my lines of communication, which have been cut off for ten days, and to keep down rebel bands. If an enemy in great force appears my strategy must be changed.

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
