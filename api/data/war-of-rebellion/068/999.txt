HEADQUARTERS COMMAND,May 13, 1864-7.30 p.m.

General BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

I still hold the outer line, but the force of the enemy is so great that they can go entirely around it, and have now done so. My force is not sufficient to fill up the entrenchments, and I cannot leave them to fight, as Drewry's Bluff has to be protected. General Beauregard writes he would be here this evening. Can any troops be send down the railroad from Richmond upon the enemy? Or if they could be send directly here we can push through their lines and join General Beauregard, and then attack their whole force.

R. F. HOKE,

Major-General.
