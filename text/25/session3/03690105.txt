25th Cong....3d Sess.
Public Defaulters—Mr. Duncan.
Ho. of Reps.
may answer the pai ticular case Can I have your
attention, sir, while I trace up some of their in-
consistencies practiced for political effect' In
1796, when Federalism had the ascendency, and
overshadowed every prospect in the country, in
the Reign of Terror, when it was common to wear
a black cockade, the term Whig was then con-
sidered an opprobrious term, it was synonymous
with Democrat, and both only fit for the lower or
ders,or, in the Federal language of the times, was
fit foi the common people, while that of Federalist
was alone fit for those who were a little uncommon,
but now, for political effect, the same party have
taken the term Whig to themselves The adop-
tion of this cognomen has answered them some
purpose It has answered the purpose of gulling
a few of the unwary, but the object of its adop-
tion begins to be understood, ltislosingitscharms.
The Federalists will be compelled to take an-
other name, to meet the next congressional and
presidential elections. The term Locofoeo is
now given to the Democracy by the Federalists,
as a taunt and a term of reproach. I shall not be
astonished at all if the Federalists should steal the
name from the Democracy, and baptize them-
selves with it, before the year 1840 We will then
have a Bank Federal-Locofoco party to contend
with. In 1812-'14, when war was declared against
England for the most violent and outrageous tres-
passes upon our commercial and other rights, in
the open violation of the established laws, usages,
and customs of nations, the Federal party, who
were always a little more attached to the constitu-
tion, laws, and customs of England than to their
own, and always deadly hostile to France, said
tauntingly, " Why don't you declare war against
France, and recover your Fiench spoliations'
You are resting undei national degradation, Fiance
has done you more mjuiy than England " But
war was prosecuted against England, and teim-
mated with the memorable battle ot the 8th of Jan-
uary, on the plains of New Orleans, a battle
which not only concluded the war, but shed a
blaze of patriotism, and a halo of glory over this
country, and this nation, which no other victory
ever did, and won laurels for those who gained it,
that will bloom in memory, when they (ay, and
the gentleman from Kentucky, [Mr. Under-
wood,] who rejoiced that there were no cannon
fired here on the 8th of January) shall mingle with
the dust But the time came when, to save the
nation's honor and dojusticeto those whose rights
had been violated, it became the duty of the Chief
Magistrate to call the attention of Congiess, and
the American people, to the redress of the injuries
which we had sustained by the French spolia-
tions, and the only means left forPresident Jack-
son was to recommend repináis At this, the
whole Federal party started, as if by one univer-
sal electric shock, and said • ' What, are you about
to declare war against France for the paltry sum
of 25,000,000 francs' What, are you about to
involve this nation in a war with France, that
must deluge us in blood, and sink us in bank-
ruptcy and rum, for the paltry consideration of
25,000 000 of francs' Are you about to declare war
against France, who assisted you through with
youi revolutionaiy struggle, and to whom you
owe a debt of gratitude you never can pay, an ob-
ligation that never can be cancelled, for the paltry
consideration of 25 000,000 francs > "
Yes, sir, this was the cry then, and it was
howled as loud, as long, and as piteously as the
crocodile cry of corruption, corruption, and panic,
panic, is now howled In 1811, when the re-
charter of the old Bank of the United States was
under congressional discussion, Mr Clay, the
now leader of the federal party, denounced the
bank as unconstitutional He contended that
Congress had no power to incorporate a bank or
any other institution, and that a bank was a dan-
gerous and an unsafe institution, but now, sir,
without any change or amendment of the Consti-
tution, and without any material change in the
policy of our country oi difference m our institu-
tions, a bink is the very thin? we want, and is
perfectly constitutional In 1816, Dame! Web
ster, whose opinions on constitutional law is the
political Koran of the Federal psrty, and before
whose opinions they fall prostrate, kiss the
ground, and worship as before Omnipotence,said
that gold and ail?er was the only currency recog-
nized by and known to the Constitution It was
the law of the land at home, and the Jaw of the
world abroad But now the rag-tag shmplaster
currency answers all the purposes ot a national
currency, and is perfectly constitutional with that
gentleman and all his party In 1830, when the
great political question, in which all others were
merged, was the recbarter of the BanK of the
United States, Mr McDuffie, chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means, made a report
in favor of the recharter of the bank, which was
popular with the Federal Bank party. Every
sentence and word of that report was hailed as
good orthodox Bank Federal doctrine, and no
part of it was more popular than the following
passage, which constituted the objections of the
committee to a national bank, and the avowed
objections of the Federal party to such an institu-
tion
In relation to a national bank, (speaking of the
number of agents which the Umted Slates Sank
employed, and their political influence,) he says
" But the patronage resulting from the appoint-
*  ment—the annual appointment of these agents,
' great as it would doubtless be, would be msig-
' nificant and harmless when compared with that
' which would  result from  the dispensation of
*  bank accommodations, to thestandmgamountof
' $50,000,000 ' The mind almost instinctively
' shrinks from the contemplation of an idea so
*  ominous to the purity of the Government and
' the liberties of the people     No Government of
' which the committee have any knowledge, ex- j
' cept, perhaps, the despotism of Russia, was ever
' invested with a patronage at once so prodigious j
' in its influence, and so dangerous in its character  I
' In the most desperate financial extremities, no |
' other  European Government  has ever  entered
'upon  an experiment so perilous     If the whole
' patronage of the English monarchy were concen
' trated in the hands of the American  Executive,
' it may be well doubted wnether the public liberty
' would be so much endangered by it, as it would
' by this vast pecuniary machine "
This was the opinion of the Federalists in 1830,
1831, and 1832, in relation to a national bank So
it was then—always was, and will be—the opinion
of the Democracy of this country This docu-
ment had a circulation throughout the United
States that no other document ever had It flew
through the country like leaves in the fall fell upon
the highways, on cross loads, in the fields, and
in every door yard, those who could read, were
compelled to read it, and those who could not
had it read to them, and no part of that report
was used in argument in favor of the recharter of
the United States Bank more than that part which
I have cited It was used to put down and nullify
the mere suggestion which General Jatkson ad
vanced, that a national bank might, perhaps, be
established, within the power of ti e Constitution,
and of less dangerous tendencies But what will
you think, sir, of Feleral con istency, when i tell
you that no sooner had General Jackson vetoed
the Bank of the United States, and the people had,
by an overwhelming maionty, sustained him in
his course, than the Federalists were for "a
national bank '" Yes, sir, for a national bank,
with all its subjugating tendencies and " Russian
despotism," and in 1834 the congressional elections
turned upon the question of a national bank
In 1834-'35, when the General Government was
receiving the notes of specie-paying banks in liqui-
dation of the land purchases, the Administration
was denounced  and the  practice deprecated as
destructive to the rights of the people and their
interest in the public domain     It was rung upon ,1
every change that the Administration was frittering ' i
away the public lands, which were reserved in
trust for the use of the people, and taking m con-  |
sideration the shmplasters of irresponsible banks  0
True it was, sir, that the spirit of speculation was ,
about to  draw the whole public domain m its  i
vortex    Those who had ciedit could obtain bank
notes  by the quire,  and  purchase hundreds of
thousands of acres of the puolic lands, perhaps
to the loss of the Government, as theie was an
uncertainty of the power of the banks to redeem
then paper, and to the great injury and prejudice
of the poor and industrious man, for whose use
the land is, and really of right ought to be held
Such was the rage for speculation, and such was i{
the system of monopoly, that the country was
threatened with the introduction of the feudal
system, -with the vacillating and degrading tend- 
encies peculiar to a system of landlords and ten-
ants.
General Jackson, seeing the progress of these
overwhelming evils, recommended what was called
the specie circular to the Secretary of the Treas*
ury The policy was adopted, which was to pro-
hibit the sale of a greater quantity of land than
three hundred and twenty acres to one individual,
for any other kind of currency than gold and
silver This measure had the desired effect, viz:
to bring a sound currency into the Treasury, and,
in some degree, to cheek the wild rage for specu-
lation, and to secure the public domain from the
grasp of the wealthy monopolizer But no sooner
was the specie circular put into successful opera-
tion, than the whole pack of the Opposition again
raised the howl The Administration was de-
nounced for declaring war upon the banks, war
upon the credit system, and making an odious
distinction in the currency between the Govern-
ment and the people Ihere was not a Whig
whiffet in the country, but could ask with great
emphasis, " What, is the Administration about
to establish two currencies, one for the Govern-
ment, and one for the people'" " The Govern
ment must have gold and silver, while the people
are to have shmplasters " Again, in 1834-'35,
and '36, the Federalists said it was unsafe to de-
posit the public revenuem the local banks They
were unfit for financial agents, and the " banks
and local bank-deposit system was m character
with the ruinous and destructive policy of the
Administration " Well, in 1837, when the banks
suspended payment, locked up ihe public revenue,
and proved themselves faithless agents, and un-
worthy of the confidence of the community and
the Government, and when m consequence thereof
it became the duty of the President of the United
States to recommend a separation of the Govern-
ment finances from the banks, and the establish-
ment of an independent constitutional Treasury,
then, again, was the whole force of the Federalists
arrayed against the Administration, and every
possible motive but that which was good and pa-
triotic attributed to them Ruin to the countiy,
desolation to commerce, destruction to the banks,
and prostration to every interest, public and pri-
vate, was sung from Mauve to Mexico, and as in
the case of the Treasury circular, " two cur-
rencies"' " one for the Government, and one for
the people," was exclaimed and vociferated by
every Whig thing m the country
Further, when General Ja< kson was run for
President, in 1834, [828, and 1832, the Democracy
were warned most solemnly and lovingly not to
support a military chieftain foi the Presidency,
We were told and admonished, in an apparent
spirit of patriotism and love of country, that all
Governments had fallen, and all Republics had been
subierted, by the destroying hands of military
cmeftams and m ' tai y ambition Yes, sir, we
weie told that " war, pestilence, and famine,"
would be our fate, if we should place a militaiy
chieftain in the executive chair 1 he hero of New
Orleans ought not to be made President of these
United States, we must have a civilian for a Pres-
ident But General Jaikson was elected, he
seived his first term, but no military despotism
made its appearance He was elected a second
time, and seived out his term, but no military des-
potism yet appeared But there were some honest
persons of the Democracy who perhaps thought
there would be more safety in bestowing the Pres-
idency upon a civihai', and a distinguished one,
in the person of Martin Van Buren, was presented
to the American people as the Democratic candi-
date for the Presidency But now it was discov-
eied that a civilian was not so bafeab was thought,
and particularly the one now offered, and a mili-
tary chteftam was brought foiward in the person
of Mijor General W lliam Henry Harrison, com-
mander in eh ef of the northwestern army, and
offered «s the competing candidate aeainst the
civilian already named Yes, su, in 1832 there
was danger, ay, rum to the country and downfal'
of the Government attendant on the election of the
hero of New Oileans to the Piesidency, but m
in lb3b there was no danger in electing the hero of
Tippecanoe to the same high statiq%
