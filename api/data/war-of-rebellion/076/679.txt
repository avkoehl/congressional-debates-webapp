GENERAL: We had little difficulty in drawing out last night; some shelling. I heard of but one casualty, but we found the roads rough and the bottoms marshy, so that with great difficulty and delay we made the march. General Logan is now pretty well across Camp Creek, about due south from this place. General Blair is crossing at William Campbell's, about a mile farther to the right.

A great portion of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Corps have been broken of their rest two nights. I would prefer not to march till to-morrow morning if this will do. My headquarters are on the Campbellton road, near Widow Forsyth's, one mile east of Dry Pond.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. O. HOWARD,
