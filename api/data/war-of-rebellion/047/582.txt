HEADQUARTERS SIXTH MILITARY DISTRICT, Adams Run, S. C., December 26, 1863.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I reported yesterday informally the failure of the expedition to Legareville. I omitted to state that the fuses and ammunition of the siege pieces seemed to be very defective. I have called for a full and detailed report in answer to special interrogatories.

A week ago the engineer in charge here, Lieutenant Tennent, reported to me, and I gave orders conforming to his requisitions, and the execution of them to await his call. The details are still awaiting his return form Charleston, where he went to obtain transportation, tools, &c.

The guns at Willstown and Pinebury and the earthworks there are not in condition to meet an enemy. There are no magazines. The earthworks at Pinebury are destroyed; the guns need platforms, the working parties tools, the guns ammunition, and all wagons and teams. I ask that the engineer may be returned to duty here as soon as possible, with the means of putting these lines in fighting order.

With the highest respect, your obedient servant,

HENRY A. WISE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

General Beauregard applies for a brigade of State troops for the defense of Savannah. Can you inform me what State troops are liable to serve there, and where they now are? General Cobb is absent. Are the State troops under my orders?
