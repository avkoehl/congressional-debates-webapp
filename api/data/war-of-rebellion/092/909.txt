Colonel T. B. ROY,

Steamer got aground. Thirty-second Georgia delayed. Forty-seventh Georgia (about 400) at depot, but delayed by train coming from Savannah. Breakdown on the Augusta road 112 miles from here will delay re-enforcements. Will let you know when Forty-seventh Georgia leaves.

If any other regiment can be better spared than the Thirty-second Georgia it may be sent to Pocotaligo instead.
