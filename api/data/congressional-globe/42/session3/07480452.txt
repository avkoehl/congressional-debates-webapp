THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 9,
man, woman, and child who landed there. I
lind 110 fault with the system which the State
of New York has adopted. I do not propose
to attack or charge any wrong on the commis-
sion. The gentlemen who compose that com-
mission are men of high character, of virtue,
integrity, and talent. Many of them have
given their services to that charitable cause
without fee and without reward. But I do
say that the State of New York by this law
has gathered into its treasury millions and
millions of dollars taken out of the pockets
of the immigrants who go to our northwestern
States, who go to Pennsylvania, Indiana, Wis-
consin, and Michigan, and who go to the
southern States ; that that city has taken out
of the pockets of these immigrants landing
at that port, wherever they have afterward
gone, $2 50 head money, entirely unnecessary,
and which never went to the benefit of many
of those immigrants.
Now, Mr. Speaker, I submit these general
reflections for the consideration of the House.
My health and the time I propose to limit
myself to in this debate—for by the ruling of
the Chair we are to have the previous question
called at four o'clock—will not permit me to
occupy as much time as I would like to in
enlarging on this subject and making more
specific some of the reasons which should in-
fluence us in passing this bill. I may say to
gentlemen that this bill was prepared with
great care on the model of the English immi-
grant bill, as far as applicable, prepared by
the Secretary with the aid of information from
special agents he has deputed to go and mingle
with the immigrants, perform part of the voy-
age with them, and examine into the whole
subject practically. It has been prepared with
reference to the reports of our consuls and min-
isters abroad, and with reference to the reports
of those having charge of immigrants here at
home. The subject-matter has the recommend-
ation of the President. It has the universal
approval, so far as I know, of the press of the
United States wherever the press has spoken
on the subject, and that, too, by reference to
this very bill by number and by name.
I have fulfilled my duty in obeying the in-
structions of the Committee on Commerce,
which gave this bill careful and long consider-
ation, in presenting it to the House, not as I
would desire to, not as some of my colleagues
on the committee might have done had it fallen
to their lot—and I hope they will enforce its
provisions here—but to the best of my ability
and such as my feeble health to-day will
permit.
Mr. Speaker, I now enter a motion to re-
commit this bill and substitute to the Commit-
tee on Commerce; and as the Speaker has
announced under the rule that at four o'clock
or soon thereafter the previous question will
be ordered, I yield first to the gentleman from
Missouri [Mr. Finkelnbukg] to make some
remarks on this bill, and then I will yield to
the opponents of this bill an hour for their
discussion of this bill and the presentation of
such amendments as they may wish to have
acted on. But 1 call attention to the tables and
statistics which I send to the reporters to be
added to these remarks:
