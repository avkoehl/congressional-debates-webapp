I should have stated that Colonel McElroy with his regiment, the Sixteenth North Carolina, after getting within three-fourths of a mile of the point where the battle opened Sunday morning, was directed to report to General Stuart, who took him to some point in rear of the enemy, where he attacked a camp and routed them, when he rejoined me at 3 a. m., only about two hours before the fight opened, having been marching all day and night.

I am, sir, very respectfully,

W. D. PENDER,

Brigadier-General.

Numbers 367. Report of Major William J. Pegram, C. S. Army, Walker's artillery battalion.

CAMP NEAR GUINEY'S,

May 14, 1863.

COLONEL: I have the honor to make the following report of the part taken by the batteries under my command in the recent engagements near Chancellorsville:

On Friday, May 1, 1863, whilst driving the enemy back to their fortifications, the only battery used was Lieutenant McGraw's, which was engaged for a short time in shelling the enemy back.

On Saturday morning, May 2, at 6.30 o'clock, I was directed to advance as many rifled guns on the road leading from the right of our line of battle to Chancellorsville as could be used, for the purpose of shelling the enemy's infantry in the woods.

Whilst getting the guns into position, the enemy opened on us with two batteries. A brisk cannonading was kept up for about twenty minutes, during which time I kept some of the guns actively shelling the woods, whilst the others engaged the enemy's batteries. Two pieces from Captain

's battery had been

brought in to Captain Brunson's and Lieutenant McGraw's assistance.
