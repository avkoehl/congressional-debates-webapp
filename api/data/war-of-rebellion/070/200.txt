a Commanded by Captain E. H. Lib, Fifth U. S. Cavalry.

The aggregate shows a heavy loss, illustrating the obstinate valor of the Command. I am satisfied, however, that the casualties of the rebels exceeded mine. To reach this conclusion one has only to make a calculation based upon the that the day after the battle over 400 men, too seriously wounded to be carried away, were captured in the hospital at Frederick City.

Orders have been given to collect the bodies of our dead in one burial ground on the battle-field, suitable for a monument upon which I propose to write: "These men died to save the National Capital, and they did save it."

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General, Commanding.

WASHINGTON CITY, April 2, 1865.

Brigadier General E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General.

SIR: In my official report of the battle of Monocacy, I omitted to make mention of the very great obligations I was under to Honorable John W. Garrett, president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, for his personal exertions in forwarding to my support and assistance, promptly upon their arrival at Baltimore, the advance brigade of General Ricketts' division of troops. Please attach this so as to make it part of the report alluded to.

Very respectfully,

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General, U. S. Army.
