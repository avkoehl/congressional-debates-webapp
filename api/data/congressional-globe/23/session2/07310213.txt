The S cretaiy of Sute, to whom has been re-
ferred the reso'utiop of the House of Representa-
tives of the 31st ult requesting the President " to
' communicate to that House, if not mcompatib'e
' with the public interest, any coirespondence with
' the Government of Prance, and any despatches
' received from the Minister of the United States
* at Paris, not hitherto communicated to the House
' in relation to the failure of the French Govern-
' ment to carry into effect any stipulation of the
< treaty of the fourth day of July, 1831," has the
honor to íeport to the President that, as far as is
known to the department, no couespondence has
taken place with the Government of France since
that communicated to the House on the 27th De-
cembei Irst The Secietary is not aware that
the despatches received from the Mimstei of the
United States at Puis present any material fact
which does not appeal in the correspondence
already transmitted He nevertheless encloses so
much of those despatches, written subsequently
to the commencement of the present session of the
French Chambeis, as may se,veto show the state
of the business to which they relate since that
time, and also that portion of an early despatch
which contains the substance of the assurances
made to him by his Majesty the King of the
Trench, at a foi mal audience granted to him for
the puipose of presenting his credentials, and he
submits, foi the President'sconsideiation,whether
the residue can,consistently with thepubhc intei

Sir   On Monday I presented my lettei ot ere
dence to the King, on which occasion 1 made the
address to him, a copy of which is enclosed
********
His answer was long and earnest 1 cannot
pieterd to give you the word-, of it, -but in sub-
stance, it was a warm expiession of his good
feehns towards the United S Men, for the hospi
tality he had íeceived there, &c * * *
As to the convention, he said, assure your Gov
ernment that unavoidable circumstances alone
prevented its immediate execution, but it will be
faithfully peiformed, assure your Government of
this, he repeated, the necessary laws *ill be passed
at the next meeting ot the Chambeis 1 tell you
this not only as King, but as an individual wnose
promise will be fulfilled

I t'o not hope for any decision on our affans be
fore the middle of January One moiive fui de ay
is, an expectation that the message of the Pi evi-
dent may arrive before the discussion, and that it
may contun someihing to show a stiong national
feeling on the subject This is not mete conjecluie,
I know the fact and I íepeat now, troui a full .
knowledge of the case, what I have more than
once stated in my former despatches as my firm
persuasion that the moderate tone taken by our
Government when the rejection was first known, j
was attnbuted by some to indifference, oi to a
conviction on the part of the President that he
would not be supported in ary strong measure by
the people, and by otheis, to a consciousness that
the Cunvention had given us more than we were
enutled to ask                                                              i
I saw last night an influential membei of the I
Chamber wno told me that * * * *
and that the King had spoken of our affans, and ,
appealed extiemeiy anxious to secure the passage '
oí the law 1 mention this as one of the many y
circumstances which, independent of official as- i!
smances, convince me that the King is sincere, i
and now 1 tiuve no doubt of the sincerity of his ,
Cabinet From all this, you may imagine the
anxiety I shall feel for the ainval of the Piesi-
aent's message On us tone will depend very
much, not only the payment of our claims, but
our national reputation for energy I have no
I doubt it will be such as to attain both of these
important objects

Legition of the United States,
Paris, Decembei 6, 1834
The Chambers were convened on the 1st inst ,
under very excitin  circumstances, the ministers,
individually, and the papéis supposed to speak
their lang iaj;e, having previously announced a
design to enter into a full explanation of their
conduct to answer all the intenogations and place
then continuance of office on the question of ap-
proval by the Cnambers of their measuies
This, as you will see by the papéis, they have
finally and explicitly done, and after a waini
de"bate o'f two days, which hasjust clobed, they have
gained a decided victoiy Ihis gives them confi
dence, permanence, and 1 hope influence enough
to carry the treaty Í shall now urge the present
ation of the law at as eaily a day as possible and
although I do not yet feel vc-y ceitam of success,
my hopes ofit are natuially much increased by the
vote of this eveni ig The conversations I have
had with the King and with all the ministers, con
vmceme that now they are perfectly in eai nest, and
unite 1 on the question, and that it will be urged
with zeal and abi uy
Many of the dep mes, too, with whom I have
entered into explanations on the subject, seem row
convinced that the interest as wel' as the nonor of
the nation r quires the fulfillment of then engage
ments This gives me hopes that the endeavors
I shall continue to make,w thout ceasing until the
que Hon is dec J'd, may be successful
The intimation 1 haveconceived myself authoi
ized to make of the serious consequen"esth¡,t msy
be expected tiom another ie]ec ion o£the hw,and
of the firm de ermmation of oui Government to
admit of no íeduction oi change in the treaty, I
think has had an effect On the v/hole, I repeat,
that, without being at all confident, I now enter
tain oetter hopes than 1 have for some'ime past
done

My last despatch (6 h Decembei) was wmten ,
immediately after   the  vote  of the   Chamber of I
Deputies had, as it was thought, secuied a ma
jonty  to   the  Administration—and  it  naturally
(xcited hopes which that supposition was cal u
lated to inspiie     I soon found, howevei, both
fiom the tone of the Administra! on piess  and
fiom the language of the King and ill the Minis
terswith whom 1 con eiredon thesub|ect,that they
were not willing to put their popularity to the test
on our question      It will not be made one, on the
deteimmation of which the Ministers are willing
to risk their port folios     The very next day after
the debate, the Ministerial Gazette, (Les Debats,)
deelaied that, satisfied with the appiobation the
Chamber had given to their system, it was at per-
fect hbeity to exercise its discretion as to particu-
lar measures which do rot foi m an essential part of
that system, and the communication I subsequently
had with the King and the Ministers, confirmed
me in the opinion that the 'aw for executing our
convention, was to be considered as one of those
free questions 1 combated this opinion, and asked
whether the faithful observance of treaties was
not an essential part of their system, and, if so,
whether it did not come within their rule With-
out answering this aigument, I was told of the
endeavors they were making to secure the passage
of the law, by preparing the statement* mentioned
in my former despatch. This, it is said, is nearly
finished, and from what 1 know of its tenor, it
will produce all the effect that truth and justice
can be expected to have on prejudice and party
spnit
The decision, not to make it a Cabinet question,
will not be wi hout its favorable operation      *    *
*****   some of the leaders of the oppo-
sition, who may not be willing to take the respon-
sibility of a rupture between the two nations by
| breaking the tieaty, when theyare convinced that
I insteid of foicmg the Ministeis to resign, they
will themselves onlv mcui the odium of having
i caused  the national breach     In this view of the
i subject, I shall be much aided, if, by the tenor of
I the Piesident's message, it is seen that we shall
j resent the breach of faith they contemp'ated      It
I i? on all hands conceded that it would be impiu
dent to press the decision before the next month,
when the exposition will be printed and laid be-
foie the Chambers
*          *****
On the whole, I am fai from being sanguine of
success in the endeavors which I shall not ceabe
to make foi the accomplishment of this important
object of my mission, and I expect with some
solicitude the instructions foi my conduct, m the
piobable case of a lejection of the lav/

LOW LIVINGSTON
Hon   Johv Forsyth,
& cietaiy of State
Mr ADAMS, of Massachusetts, moved to refer
the messi^e and documents to the Commute on
Foieign Relations, with instructions to report forth-
with on the subject
Mr Mc\l\d said, as the papers accompanying
the message weie of an important character, he
moved that they be read   which was done
Mi CAMBRELENG hoped that the gentleman
fiom Massachusetts, after having heard the cor-
respondence read, would withdiaw that part of his
motion which proposed to instruct the committee
to report forthwith Hetrustedthe House would
allow the committee till the last moment to decide
upon measures reqmiing unanimity, and involving
such impoiiant considerations On such a ques-
tion, he would appeal to no particular poition of
the House foi he felt assured that, whenevei we
wereca led upon to dec de on a i roper measuie of
redress, there could be bit one sentiment where
the national chaiactei and honor were involved
Tie tiustel thit,whene er we should be called
upon to act decisively, whatever might beptoposed
by the cmmittee, w( old receive the unanimous
vote of the House He rose merely for the pur-
pose of solici mg the gentleman fiom Massachu-
setts to withdiaw that pait of his motion wh ch
pmposed to instruct the committee to report forth-
with foi, at the piesent moment, it would be
almost impossible to repoit any measure whiih
would meet the approbation of the Committee or
of ihe House
Mi J Q. ADAMS aa'd, in mtroducirg this
resolution, his purpose wat that the Con mittee
on To ei"n Relations should I einslru ted to report
fniiv.uk—he used the *Word foilhvilk in ori'er to
aseertan wl ethei that House thouoht it lncon
sistent with their duty, and the intei ests and honor
of the nation, to leave this great sub,ect any longe-
without action upon it And as the action of the
House must depend upon the report to be made
