Northern Alabama. I will, however, have them put in order, and use them with some drilled men in my command. I have never heard anything from Colonel Hagan upon the subject of artillery. Hope he may send them to me promptly.

I give reports on the other side as I get them, not vouching for the correctness of anything I hear from citizens.

Lieutenant General LEONIDAS POLK,

HEADQUARTERS,In the Field, March 10, 1863.

Colonel RODDEY:

COLONEL: General Van Dorn directs me to inform you that he is in position on the south side of Rutherford Creek. The enemy are in force at Spring Hill.

W. C. SCHAUMBURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

COLUMBIA, March 10, 1863.

Lieutenant-General POLK:

Enemy forming line of battle in front of my position, in Rutherford County.

I am afraid my pontoon bridges are not finished; will not destroy them. I will have to move out toward Lewisburg pike.

EARL VAN DORN.

COLUMBIA, March 10, 1863.

General BRAGG and

Lieutenant-General POLK:

I shall fail in getting my pontoon bridge over the river, and shall ferry my artillery over, and cut out toward the Lewisburg pike, cross near Chapel Hill, and return to Columbia. Can you send troops that can reach Columbia before I can? I am confident it is the design of the enemy to take the place, if possible. Three brigades were in sight to-day, besides cavalry. River very high and rising rapidly. All streams past fording, and still rising.

Can you answer to-night?

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.
