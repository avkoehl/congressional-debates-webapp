done much to harass the enemy, attacking him boldly on several occasions, and capturing many prisoners. a detachment of 17 men of Hampton's brigade, under the brave Sergeant michael, attacked and routed a body of 45 Federals, near Wolf Run Shoals, killing and wounding several and bringing off 15 prisoners, with the loss on our part of Sergeant Sparks, of the Second South Carolina Regiment, who, a few days before, with 2 of his comrades, attacked, in Brentsville, 6 of the enemy sent to take him, killed 3, and captured the rest.

In announcing these achievements, the commanding general takes special pleasure in adverting to the promptness of the officers in striking a successful blow whenever the opportunity offered, and the endurance and gallantry with which the men have always supported their commanders.

These deeds give assurance of vigilance, activity, and fortitude, and of the performance of still more brilliant actions in the coming campaign.
