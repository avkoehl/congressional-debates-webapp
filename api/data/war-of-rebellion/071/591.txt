CONFEDERATE CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.
HEADQUARTERS VALLEY DISTRICT,Leetown, July 3, 1864--8 p. m.

Major General JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE:

GENERAL: Your note of 4 p. m. is just received. You will have secured for the use of the entire army such public stores as may have been left by the enemy. All shoes in the private stores will be secured in like manner. You will seize all other goods in the stores in Martinsburg, and place them in charge of a responsible and competent quartermaster, to be confiscated for the benefit of the Government; and take the most efficient measures to prevent all plundering or private appropriation of these goods or any other captures.

You will send a regiment on the railroad to Hedgesville to burn the bridge this side of that place and all bridges from there to Martinsburg. You will have the bridge over Tuscarora, and all bridges from Martinsburg to the Opequon, and over that stream burned; and move Gordon's division on the road by Walpers' Cross-Roads (near Kearneysville) and Halltown to Harper's Ferry. One brigade of this division may be left at Martinsburg to secure the public property and confiscated goods and the destruction of the railroad bridges, while the rest of it is moving to Harper's Ferry. If Vaughn is at Bunker Hill let him move by Smithfield and Charlestown to Harper's Ferry. If he has passed Bunker Hill move him by the nearest route to Harper's Ferry. I will move everything in that direction in the morning.

I am, general, respectfully,

J. A. EARLY,

Lieutenant-General.

Major-General BRECKINRIDGE:

GENERAL: I advanced with my command this morning through Bunker Hill nearly to Darkesville. I met the enemy's cavalry in strong force and have been skirmishing with them, but have been unable to drive them. I have fallen back one mile this side of Bunker Hill. Would like to have 100 sharpshooters to support me.

By order of Major H. W. Gilmor, commanding:
