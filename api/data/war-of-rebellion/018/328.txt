division, have been transmitted to General McDowell, who directs me to inform you that supplies are being deposited at this place as fast as possible, from which General Shields must be supplied with his own wagons, there being no others here. There is an abundance of forage on General Shields' route, of which he must avail himself, as no forage can be got forward such a distance at this time. When any shall be deposited here of course he can have it.

As to impressment of horses, no one except the officers of the quartermaster's department in General Shields' division must take them, and then only to replace those unfit for service, giving regular receipts therefor.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. SCHRIVER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

Captain Mallory's

------

of the 3rd June, to the chief commissary of this department, has been seen by General McDowell, who directs you to be informed that if the prisoners of war now at Strasburg be sent via Middletown to Colonel Christian's regiment, encamped at the forks of the Shenandoah, on the Winchester side, they will be subsisted, but provisions cannot be sent forward, as suggested in the note, because of the destruction of bridges and rise of water at the fords.

To effect the above Colonel Christian will be ordered to send two companies of his regiment to Strasburg for the purpose of escorting the prisoners to his headquarters, on being notified in advance of the time when the prisoners can be sent.

Very respectfully,

ED. SCHRIVER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

Major General E. O. C. ORD,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: Understanding that you have resumed command of your division, Major-General McDowell directs that you take charge of the railroad, including its bridges, between this point and Strasburg. For the protection of the bridges suitable block-houses will be erected. This special duty will be assigned to Duryea's brigade, it being the intention of the general to remove the other two (Ricketts' and Hartsuff's) up the valley.

The telegraph line should also have your attention and protection, and any person found interfering in any mischievous way with either railroad or telegraph will be put to death on the spot.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. SCHRIVER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
