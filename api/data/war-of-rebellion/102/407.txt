WARRENSBURG, May 11, 1865.

Major-General DODGE:

Dispatch demanding surrender of Lexington received. There are 180 available men at Lexington. Two companies of militia are called out into active service for the defence of the place, and the citizens will be organized into companies. I do not think that the place will be attacked, but that the guerrillas will attempt to cross the river to-night above or below Lexington. The colonel left Lexington this morning and will be here to-night.

C. G. LAURANT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
