demagogues, as the persecution and death of her
good, wise, and just Socrates will beai evidence.
Rome had hei demagogues, and the United Slates
have their demagogues
If there is any one abominable thing on the face
of the earth more abominable than another, it is a
vile demagogue Kingdoms have been prostrated,
empnes have been dissolved, and Republics ha\e
been subverted by demagogue1? The greatest,
the wisest, and the most virtuous men that ever
adorned the human family have been brought to
poverty, persecution, and death by tile dema-
gogues There is no man who now moulders
with the dead, who was more 4andeted and
traduced than has been the statesman, the pa-
triot, and the philosopher of Monticello, by the
vile demagogues of the same party to which the
member belongs There is no man who mingles
with the living, who has been more traduced and
vihned by vile demagogues, of the sime ptrty, than
has been the winter bleached patriot of the Hermi-
tage, \\ ho only lives to link the living with the
<lead, and to tell the stones of the Revolution, and
the sufferings, hardships, and privations oí our
fathers, with a warm heart, and with living lips
Can Mr Van Buren then expect to escape ihe
slander and detraction of vúe demagogues? When
he does, he must know he has lost iavor with his
God and his country Rew ard awaits virtue and
merit    This is a Divine promise
The names of those statesmen and patriot":, when
all now living will be mingling with the dust, will
occupy a part of the brightest page of American
history, and will -itill live in the grateful remem-
brances of their countrymen, while the names cf
the ule demagogues who have traduced them, and
are now slandering them, mil be consigned to the
rubbish oi a corner, or only be seen in the polluted
columns of a bought or bribed and a corrupted
newspaper

practices of the Government as in their opinion
shall tend to «ring back the administration thereoi
to the standard of the original purity ot the Consti-
tution "
Mr POTTER, being entitled to the floor, rose
and addressed the House as follows
Mr Chairman Tin, reading of the Constitution,
as expounded by the honorable gentleman from
Massachusetts, prefacing the introduction of the
resolution offered by him, in man} po nts accoida
with the Republican code of 1799. Light has bro-
ken upon us from a region heretofore hostile to the
Conservative doctrines of a strict construction of
the delegated powers of  the  Constitution    All
should concur m the soundness of the posilicns,
that public opinion is the ultimate arbiter of ei ery
measure of Government, and that a salutary
jealousy of the encroachments of power is germam
to the piescivation of free institutions, Thcchecks
and balances of power, as delegated to the*Coordi-
nate bi anches of the Government, must tie sacredly
preseived, to retain the symmetry of the whole
Whenever euher branch take a single step beyond
the boundaiy designated and drawn around them
by the Constitution, they wander into a boundless
field, susceptible of no clear or accurate definition
So long as wt preserve the principle "that all pou
ers not delegated to the United States by the Con-
stitunon, nor prohibited by it to the States, aie re-
scued to the States or to the people,"and lestram
each separate branch of the Government in its con-
stitutional oibit, the people of this country will be
free, m the loftiest sense of freedom. Free to do
all good, restneted only from evil, every man pur-
suing the bent of his own genius oi fortune, every
citr/en piotected by laws inviolable, or whose vio-
lation is instantly punished, by certain and just | e-
nallies—w e will only ceaie to be free when thepi oplr
becomescoirnpt When (hat period arm es, freedom
w ill not be found here When you witness the con-
tumely ol man to man,the%indictiyenessofpop llai
ia^,e, ihe down cast visage and degraded form
c f the connpted self—}on may with certainty pro-
nounce this people aie no loMgei free They have
abantloii''dfreedomMiving principles—justice, tem-
perance, and truth The niCrmgemcnt of any of
the constitutional powers of cithei of ihe time
branches of our Government should be met at
the tl reshhold If the Executive has "in delega-
tion of the letter an I spirit of the Constitution,"
trenched on the judicial ci legislative power, it
should be sternly rebuked, and confined to as
constitutional boundaries In doing this, we should
be careful not to inflict a wound upon the princi-
ples of the Constitution Republics should gu ird
against the danget of faction, and always beai in
mind, that in the midst of glowing harangues and
pompous professions, the most deadly stabs aip
aimed at hbeity Recollect the fate of France I ra
time the mightiest ol republics, for the mere) of
heaven the bn< fest all was hypocrisy that was ni t
henry—equal rights were those of equal robbery
—liberty veiled her face, and the offerings on her
i lolated shrine, wcr« the spoils of patriotism, vir ue,
and honor
The reasons assigned for a departure from
the usual course of reference, demands a care-
ful and attentue consideration The truth of
the bold assumptions, of usurpation of power "in
derogation of the letter and spirit of the Con,titu-
t on," contained in tne resolution, should be tested
That portion of the President's Message, refeinng
to the financial relations of the Government, have
been brought into review, and the recommendations
of the President airaigned with peculiar asperity
it is alleged that an appeal was taken from the
principles ol the Messige sent m at Ihe extia ses-
sion I) the people, and that the response has Leen
gloriously against the President, that new light has
been shed on the vexed question of a national
bank, that the tg-ms/uiuns that led Tennessee, with
other sections of the Union, astray, has been di si-
paled, and trut the broad and glorious banner of a
new monopoly "streams m light," that Maine,
Rhodp Island, and New York have rebuked the
President, jet he contumaciously adheres to his
course A.s to (he elections in Rhode Island and
Maine, ihe principles developed m the Message
could have nad, in the first, no influence whatever,
and in the latter, not one out of one thousand of
the votere had seen or read it before casting the i
suffrage' In New York, their State elections
were mixed up with numeious ingredients Nay,
it is evident that, in the one party, there was
union, zeal, money, and talent, m the other,
supineness, discord, and division Thcr-joicmg
and illuminations for the victory of party, in
that State, by many who were "too moral
a^d lei ginns" to rejc ce and illuminate for the
victory of their country's arms over a fore ?n
enemy, may raise a spirit n fha empire S ate
which will turn this joy mto sorrow. What
do  the  political   opponents   of   the  President

the honoiable gentleman from Kentucky (Mr Un-
deiwood) points cwt as the panacea for every ill

late Pies dent, pending the canvass for re-election,
vetoed the bill rechartenng the batik, and fearless-

What was the result? The re-election, by an un-
precedented majority of the electoral voles, of that
man, who had staked his political destiny on op-
position to a national bank This was no pehe-
meral voice of the people, but a direct and consti-
tutional expression of the popular wall.
The decisive measure of the removal of the de-
posites from the vaults of the bank, produced a
second conflict before the people. The succeeding

tribunal, and declared bis acts relative to (he
removal of the deposites to be in derogation of the
Constitution and laws This severe censare was
] ubhshed to the world, and carried, as if upon the
winds, to everj citv, town, and hamlet, m the
Union Pecuniary distress and embairassment
were brought upon the people by the action of the
bank, cl imor raised to a fearful extent, and the
walls of the Capitol, for days and weeks, and
months, made to echo and re-echo with eioqeent
denunciations against the tyranny and usurpations

present Chief Magistiate was not devoid of a like
test of the popular will on this question An

sustained him, on the ground of opposition to a
