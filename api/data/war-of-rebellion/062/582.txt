Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff:

My staff officer returned this a.m. from Red River. Transports arrived there last Friday evening. Nineteen gun-boats went up Red River Saturday at 9 a.m. Will probably arrive at Fort De Russy Sunday p.m. Twenty-one transports with troops left mouth of Red River at 3 p.m. Saturday. Firing heard last night. Am I to obtain further information of movements on Red River?

Major D. C. HOUSTON,

Chief Engineer, Brashear:

MAJOR: In what condition is the pontoon train? There is urgent necessity for speedy advance. Could the arrival of the train at New Iberia be much hastened by taking steam-boat transportation from Berwick?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

(Received 9.35 p.m.)

Brigadier-General STONE,

Chief of Staff:

The pontoon bridge is all ready to move as soon as the wagons arrive, which should be to-morrow or next day at the furthest. The engineer regiments are at Franklin. Most of their tools are here, waiting the arrival of the wagons. I do not think anything will be gained by steam-boat transportation for the pontoon train . It can move to New Iberia in less than three days. Navigation above Franklin is very tedious.
