SIR: Pursuant to instructions I left Camp Iaqua on the 17th instant with ten men and ten days' rations, and accompanied the Government train same day to Brown's ranch and camped for the night; distance traveled, fifteen miles. May 16, I traveled with the Government train to Big Slough, a distance of seven miles, and camped, on account of a sudden for which made it impossible for me to know what course I was going after I had left the trail. May 17, at daylight I was attacked by a severe chill; got my men ready to march, but before 6 a. m. a heavy fever set in on me, so that I was unable to leave camp. May 18, sent to Fort Humboldt for medicine; unable to leave camp. May 19, the Government train arrived at Big Slough, and myself and men returned to Brown's ranch with the train and camped. May 20, I left Brown's ranch with the train, and returned to Camp Iaqua for the purpose of getting medical attendance; total distance traveled, forty-two miles. Trail good, wood and water plenty, and forage in abundance.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
