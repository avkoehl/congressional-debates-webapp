GREENSBOROUGH, N. C. April 11, 1865-3. 30 p. m.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Headquarters:

The enemy's cavalry in small force this morning cut the Danville railroad ten miles from here, and, as reported, moved eastwardly. Lest communication should be lost, I telegraph to say that General Beauregard proposes, after General Walker shall join him, which will be ordered to commence forthwith, to unite with you at the Yadkin, in front of Salisbury. And this seems to me to be the most easy method, if pursued, of effecting the proposed junction.

JEFF'N DAVIS.

Headquarters, via Raleigh:

Dispatch of 1. 30 p. m. received. Secretary of War has not arrived. To save time and have all information it is probably bettery that you come here. In that event you will give the needful instructions to your second in command, and, if circumstances warrant, suspend the movement suggested in dispatch of 3. 30 p. m. for a time, which will enable you to communicate from here with that officer, or to indicate that the line has been broken by enemy, so as to interrupt communication.
