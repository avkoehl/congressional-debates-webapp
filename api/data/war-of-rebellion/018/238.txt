Ewell has turned back, but the last suspicious telegram from Winchester points in the other direction. Will telegraph you from Charlestown.

Respectfully, yours,

JOHN S. CLARK,

Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

HARPER'S FERRY, May 25, 1862.

(Received 2.15 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

General Banks' army, bivouacked last night 1 1/2 miles south of Winchester, was attacked this morning at daylight. Government stores and depot burned. Rebels occupied town at 8 a. m. The wagon trains left before the action commenced. This retreat was conducted in good order up to 10 o'clock on the Martinsburg pike, contesting the ground inch by inch, Ewell's force crowding them closely. Scattered parties of rebels reported in the vicinity of Berryville. The Third Maryland just arrived. No reliable news since 10 a. m.

WILLIAMSPORT via HAGERSTOWN, May 25, 1862-8 p. m.

(Received 10.10 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Main body of infantry between here and Martinsburg. Attack commenced about 5.30 o'clock this morning by Ewell's cavalry and infantry, and been hotly pursued all day. Losses are heavy. Colonel Donnelly wounded, and his brigade roughly handled. General Hatch reported to be taken prisoner. Horrible barbarities committed: Refising to give quarter; shelled the hospital in Winchester and bayoneted the sick in it; citizens of Winchester zealous in firing on soldiers from dwellings. Retreat conducted in good order, considering the great odds to contend against. To-morrow may be worse than to-day, as the ford is 5 feet deep, and the ferry can carry but 100 men, or two wagons, making a trip in twenty-five minutes. Stores at Front Royal captured. All at Winchester burned. Colonel Kenly killed with a pistol in an ambulance after being wounded. Lieutenant-Colonel Brown, Twenty-eighth New York, reported killed; Major Cook also. Some indications of presence of a portion, at least, of Jackson's force. Communications open with the general, but have not yet seen him.

JOHN S. CLARK,

Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.
