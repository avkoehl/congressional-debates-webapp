raised under proper authority, whether originally granted by Governors of loyal States or directly by the War Department. Subsistence, prior to muster, will be paid from the appropriation for "collecting, drilling, and organizing volunteers," and subsequent thereto from the appropriation for the subsistence of the Army. Requisitions for funds for the former expenditures will be made upon the Adjutant-General, and for the latter upon the Commissary-General of Subsistence. Accounts for expenditures under the first head will be rendered to the Adjutant-General, and under the second to the Commissary-General of Subsistence.

II. The attention of officers supplying subsistence to volunteers in the process of their organization into companies and regiments, both prior to and subsequent to muster, is called to the exorbitant prices demanded and paid for this object. Rations, in kind, will hereafter be issued whenever cooking facilities can be furnished to the troops, whether in squads or in larger bodies. If the rations cannot be contracted for at a reasonable rate, subsistence will be procured in bulk and issued to the volunteers. In no case should the cost of a ration, uncooked, exceed 19 cents, and at most of the points in the Western States it should not exceed 14 cents. When cooking facilities cannot be furnished, contracts for the rations, cooked, may be made at reasonable rates, and the necessity for the same must be clearly stated on the accounts. When board and lodging are necessary, the prices for each should be stated, and the aggregate cost of both must not exceed 40 cents per day.

III. No bands for volunteer regiments will in future be mustered into service, and vacancies that may hereafter occur in bands now in service will not be filled. All members of bands now in service that are not musicians will be discharged upon receipt of this order by their respective regimental commanders.

By order:

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

III. To guard against accidents, such as have in several instances caused serious injury, it is hereby ordered that troops transported by railroad through disaffected parts of the country shall march on foot over bridges where possibility exists of the cars breaking through.
