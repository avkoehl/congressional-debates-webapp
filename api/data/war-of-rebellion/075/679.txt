Brigadier-General CANTEY,

General Johnston says bring up 1,000 men of your brigade so soon as you can get cars. One Arkansas regiment will reach you in the train to-day. Stop it and take the cars. Leave your best colonel to command until General Reynolds arrives and then direct him as soon as all Reynold's brigade is up to come promptly up to join you. Give General Reynolds on his arrival, or leave for him the following order from General Johnston:

General Reynolds will take command at Resaca, and make every arrangement to protect the trains and hold the post. He will communicate with General Martin at Calhoun all information he obtains of the enemy, and ask General Martin to communicate such as he gets. He will relieve General Cantey's troops as fast and as soon as his own arrive.
