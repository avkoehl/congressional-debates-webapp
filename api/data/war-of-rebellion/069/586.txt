HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 4, 1864-5.30 a. m.

Major General A. E. BURNSIDE:

GENERAL: The enemy have abandoned their works in my front, withdrawing about daylight, their skirmishers falling back a short time since. The prisoners report that they fell back to the left, moving on the Shady Grove road. They report their loss as considerable. I have ordered my skirmishers advanced a short distance, but shall not move without orders. I presume Major Morton will order the work going on here suspended.

Your obedient servant,ROBERT B. POTTER,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 4, 1864.

General R. B. POTTER, Commanding Second Div., Ninth Army Corps:

Your dispatch received. General Willcox makes a like report, and he has sent out a strong reconnaissance in his front to ascertain the point to which the enemy has retreated, if possible. It would seem to obviate the necessity for anything more than scouts on your part, as they have, no doubt, passed entirely by your extreme left, but it would be well to throw out as far as or beyond the Via house. Major Morton has left here to look at the work near your headquarters. Please request him, in my name, to suspend the work. Please communicate this to Colonel Cesnola, and request him to inform General Wilson.

Very respectfully, yours,

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Ninth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Are the forces of General Ferrero on the Cold Harbor road? I understood that they were somewhere in that direction. Colonel Cesnola has just sent me word that his withdrawal leaves the road to Cold Harbor and the White House open. This I suppose to be a mistake.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,ROBERT B. POTTER,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 4, 1864-9.25 a. m.

General R. B. POTTER, Commanding Second Div., Ninth Army Corps:

The general commanding directs that you hold your command in readiness to move at a moment's notice. Orders have been received to move to the left, and definite instructions will be sent you soon.

By command of Major General A. E. Burnside:

D. R. LARNED,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
