Major-General HEINTZELMAN:

Major-General Stahel was directed by me to make a reconnaissance with his disposable cavalry in the direction of Warrenton, where I had reason to believe the enemy held a brigade of cavalry. Up to this hour I have received no advises from him. Unless he should fall in with the enemy, I shall look for his return to-night.

HOOKER,

Major-General.

General REYNOLDS (by signal); Captain McKEE, Monocacy; Captain TURNBULL, Edward Ferry:

General Pleasonton reports he attacked the enemy's cavalry, under Stuart, yesterday. He was assisted by Barnes' division of the Fifth Corps. Drove him steadily all day through Upperville into Ashby's Gap, and inflicted heavy loss upon him at every step; captured a large number of small-arms, sabers, &amp;c. ; two pieces of artillery (one a Blakely gun), three caissons, and exploded one. A number of prisoners and a large number of wounded left in Upperville. Enemy left dead and wounded on the field. Our loss small. A disastrous day to the rebel cavalry. Many charges made, and the saber used freely, with great advantage to us. Please inform the commanders in your vicinity of the above, and let it be made known to the troops.
