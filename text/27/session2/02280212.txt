Mr ADAMS continued In looking over the National Intel
ligencer this mornmg for the report oí yesterday's proceedings
m his case, he found but a very brief notice of it, which he
would read to the House    Mr A then read as follows
"The Question of Privilege —The House resumed the con
Bideration of the unfinished business of yesterday, being the
resolution of censure upon Mr Adams, offered by Mr Gilmkr,
and the amendment of Mr Marshall thereto, and the amend
ment to the amendment as offered by Mr ¡summers
"Mr Adams resumed and continued hisremarks until a quar
ter past 3 o'clock, when he yielded to a motion by
"Mr Everett that the House adjourn
"Which motion being agreed to, the House adjourned "
There was, then, no report of yesterday's proceedings m that
paper    Then lollowed a note by the Editors, which he would
also read for the mfoimation of the House    Mr   A  then read
the following
"Note by the Editors —The Editors regret to he obliged to
discontinue the daily repoit of the Debatesm the House on the
case of Mr Adams, until that gentleman can have an oppor
tunny, should he think fit to exercise it, to prepare a report of
his remarks for the press This determination is induced by
harsh and unmerited reflections made by him, in his speech
yesterday, upun the laborious efforts which have been made by
our Reporters to present him fairly to the public This is
treatment which neither the Reporters nor the Publishers de-
serve at any body s hands As the best way to avoid it during
the remainder of tins debate, m which Mi A is so rruch per
Eonally concerned the Editors feel themselvesobhged to refrain
from publishing any other than authorized reports oí the re
mamdei of it'
Mr A continued The Reporters, therefoie, did not choose
to continue on the reports on this subject, and what wa  to take
place thereafter, so far as related to him, was not to be pub
lished, unless prepared or authorized by himself He wished
to have no misunderstanding either with the editors of the Intel
ligencei or then Reportéis Ihatpapei had two of the best
Itepoiteis he ever knew, to take debates, when they thought
proper to do so From the very commencement of this conti o
versy, m which, as the editors of the Intelligencer observed, he
was deeply interested, he had privately cumplained to both the
editors, of the manner in which he had been misrepresented m
their leports Theiewere publications in the Intelligencer it
self, inconsequence of some of the complaints which he had
made The hrst of them was the omission lo i eport the extract
of a lettei of the late Senator from the State of Alabama [Mr
C C Clayl to the Legislature of his State, which he (Mr A)
read at the commencement of this \ roseoution He lead it there
m his place It had been the foundation of the whole system of
his delence, and it was so still He should be obliged to have
recourse to it, time after time, m the progress of his defence
The repot t m the Intelligencer not only omitted to give the < x
«act of that letter, but gave a totally incorrect lepre^ntation of
what it was, and the commentaiy on it He complained of that,
and he was teld that the Rsportei had not the paper before him
m which that letter was Was that an answer! Was th it a
justification! The Reporter had not the paper before him Why
that extract, with the commentary on it, was the very cornet
stone on which he should place his defence, andso utterly was it
misiepte ented that aftiend of his, an editor in Boston, wrote to
him that he could not make head or tail of it,and asked him to ->up
ply him with the p ípt r itself Now did it icqjire any extraordi
naiy degiee of laboi or skill on the pait oí tii- Reporter to lo >k
out a id copy this extidct? Why, it was to be found m the pub
he newspapers of the day, and the Reportci cou'' have g it it
in five inmutes time if he thought pioper He complained ol
this omisión to une of the editors and within a day 01 two
pdbt, it had been publishe 1 under the litad ofomi&sions m then
Tepoita But what sou of a supply was that 01 soimpoitint
an omission, when it went befoiethe world without a com
mental y? It was a total iaihne to icpiesent the true character
of this debate Notwithstanding the notice given by hi n to one

Mr ANDREWS of Kentucky said that the abuse he called
the attention of the Speaker to was a Reporter occupying one
of the member's seats within the bar, and for the last two
days, two Reporters [Torrey and Leavitt*] had been admitted
within the bar. He had spoken to the Doorkeeper on the sub
ject, and he had refused to do his duty
Mr CRITTENDEN called Mr. Andrews to order, and he
took his seat—the Reporters he spoke of having retired to then
appropriate seats
Mr ADAMS contmed There was no justification for the
Editors of the Intelligencer in refusing to continue their reports
of his case, because he complained of the injustice done him
They declared that they would not report at all except what
came authentically fiomhim Was this justice to him or jus
tice to the public who were so intensely anxious in the part of
the country from which he came, to see not only what he said
m his defence, but what was said against him1*
It was his fortune yesterday to occupy the whole day, and
he believed, he did, in the course of it, make disclosures impor
tant to the country, and that ought to be known    When the
masked battery was opened upon him by the gentleman from
Kentucky [Mr Marshall] charging him with high tieason
and other high crimes, he had not ha'f an hour allowed him
It came upon him like a clap of thunder    He had no time to
make a proper defence     Upen what, then, could he lely but
upon the justice and fidelity of the Reporters     Such a state of
things existed m this city, when debates of this nature came up
as to furnish one of the strongest reasons why the Congiess of
the United States ought to sit in a place where there was no
slavery   In the fast place, there was a slavery prejudice against
him for yeais past as he had shown by the anonymous letteis
addressed to him that he read the other day, one of which said
that his villanoub course had bDen watched, and threatened
him with assassination     There wasa prejudice against him on
the part of all slaveholders who conceived tha' his course m
Congress affected their interests, and this prejudice was alto
gether unsuited to a grave, formal  judicial trial of a man ar
raigned for high an i capital crimes In the next place the public
press under that same influence was doing him a positive and ne
gative injustice ®ne press filling the public mind with prej udice
against him even to utter misrepiesentation and vitupeiation,
equal to that of the triumvirate who had arraigned him, while
the other had suppressed material parts of his defence    Here
vra.% on the one hand, the interference of the pie0s  against a
persecuted man before his judges and his jurors, and on the
i  other hand, the National Intelligencer, under that same influ
I  ence, though not to an equal extent, after having done him ne
gative miustice would not do justice to him by continuing the
publication of his defence    That prejudice aio^e not only from
the fact that this was a blaveholding District, ind tilled with all
kind of prejudices where the question of slavery was concerned,
but from the fact that in some pait  of the South   all  papes
having the tamt of Abolition, oi containing Abohtion mattei in
them, were suppressed and prevented ft cm encuiatmg    The
prebs in this city knew that !l they sent to the city of Charleston
any papéis containing matter which the authorities of that
place conceive! affected the slave interest or even  tainttd m
the slightest degree with Abolition, that they would be seized—
pillaged bv a committee of mrendiines, and destroyed     He
held in his h ind some documents which would show the extent
of this interference in some parts oí the country with the rights
aid liberties of the people and their rights to the immunities

with  much seventy complaunn^ oí them as grievances that

of the fteedom of the press and of the sanctity of the Tost Of

ings against him, till the answers were received íromMie
Executive Departments
The SPEAKER observed to the gentleman, that u would bo
necessary for him to make his motion definite—to name some
particular day for the postponement Ifthe documents should
not come in by that day,hecouldthenmove a further postpone-
ment
Mr ADAMS accordingly moved to postpone the further con-
sideration of the subject till next Thuisday week
Mr A V BROWN called for the yeas and nays, which
were accoidingly ordered
Mr MARSHALL, aftei a few remarks which were inaudi-
ble to the Reporter, observed that he had listened foi the greater
pan of the time in which the gentleman from Massachusetts
was engaged in his defence, to the remarks of that gentleman,
and he believed that this was the sixth day on which he had oc-
cupied the floor, and the attention of the House—a period aa
long as was i equired for the creation of the world There were
really, as would appear to be the fact upon the most cursory
examination of the pioposition before the House, but two ques-
tions ef fact, and one oi law involved Had a petition been pre-
sented to dissolve the Un on of these States, and did the gentle-
man fiom Massachusetts pieaent it, and upon the^e two ques-
tions of fact did there anse undei the law of Parliamenta
breach of the privileges, and a contempt of this House? Now
the&e facts weie aheady within th*1 knowledge of the House,
and what did the gentleman piopose to doi To get information
fiom tl e Executive Departments which would enable him, in
eonnecticn with what he had said to the House, to make out a
case o f j «stification for hit, constituents who signed the petition,
and fo himself foi presenting it The gentleman had pressed
upon the attention ol the House the repeated charge that the
Sou h meditated the mtioduction of slavery upon the free
teta es of the North He had aheady announced on this floor
that the South wished to involve thib country m a war with
Great Butain for the purpose oi reviving the Afncan slave
trade, and he had warned the North that a conspiracy existed
in the South to repeal the habeas corpus, and the trial by jury,
and abolish the freedom of speech and of the press
The gentleman hadavowed, in the face of a British nobleman
and statesman, who wasaclmitted to a seat in this hall, that the
light to search our vessels on the high seas, claimed by the Bn
Ush, was ajust une, and he defied American statesmen to con
troveit it
Mr ADAMS denieuthat he had made any such avowal
Mi MARSHALL &aid he referred to theiepoit of the gen
tleman's speech in the papéis of this city, and hehad heard
eveiy woid of u The gentleman denied that he employed the
language attubuted to him, but the gentleman wa& so reponed
both in the Globe and¡Iiitelhge icei, and if any gentleman would
take the troubte to pmiyiii e thp two lepoits, he would find
sacha difference in the language, though the substance was
the same m both papéis as to prove that theie was no collu
&ion or undemanding between the diñVrent Ilepoi ters
What now was thepioposititn of the gentleman'? Why that
this question which had consumed so mi ch of the time oí the
House, with regard to which the gentleman professed to enter
tain so much delicacy, is to he postponed to give him time to
set documents from the Executive Departments to enable him
to make out his case Re lays down his ground5* and calls for
the pioof Now so far os the question between the gentleman
andhirn>plí was concerned, and so far as the question before
the íIou=¡e wa^ involved, he was willing to admit that all the
gentleman sought to establish was true, piotesting, however,
dsambt itt, being used it any future time What was it that
the gentleman pi oposed^ To justify himself and hisconstitu
ents foi presenting a petition foi dissolving the Union, on the
giouuelboi the tJc eld rati on of Independence, and he now calls
ioi piooftomake out a ca^e of grievances, and show that the
time had come, and the right existed, to abolish our present
foi m oí Government
That was the gentleman's couise of argument and that was the
course he had pursued for the last six days So far as he (Mr
M ) was concerned, he was willing to admit all the gentleman
wibhed to prove, and he now called upon the House to know
to what en 1 all the gentleman s aigument  and all hia docu-
ments were to be produced Would the couise the gentleman
■ñas, puismg amount to a justification of the act chaiged against
him') Would it justify him should he be able to prove it that
theie eyisted m the St urn thobe treasonable designs he had
chaigedagamstit, to foice th* institution of slavery on the
free-states, and to abol i the habeas corpus, and the trial by
juivi TMippo^e the Hou c should agree toa postponement till
thet,e it eman could bin ¡j foi ward proof to -ustam the charges
he had made, what then? Was the House to acquit him, and
