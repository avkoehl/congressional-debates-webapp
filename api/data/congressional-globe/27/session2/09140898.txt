innovaron is meditated agamstTne Constitution,
and violence is invoked to annul one of its Execu-
tive barriers, because it is an obstacle to the en-
cro&chmenisÜthe Legislature If the veto pow-
er, as ii 11 called, were abolished in the Executive,
u wou d remain in the Judiciary; unconstitutional
legislation might sull be arrested there, and it
would not be in the power of two-thirds to control*
the decisions of the Supreme Court. Hence xt is,
perhaps, that distrust has been recently so emphat-
ically expressed as to the competency of that court
to decide on questions which have unfortunately
' arisen as to the authority of the Government to col-
lect any revenue since the 30th of June last. The
objects of those who believe that certain measures
of parly policy are of more consequence than the
present organization of our Government, can only
be partially accomplished by abrogating the veto
of the Executive. There remains, besides the
veto of the Judiciary, the veto of the people. All
the powers of our Government, into whatever
hands they may be distributed, must be exercised
tinker re ponsibiiity to the laws and to popular
cpm'cn When a President returns a bill to either
House of Congress, with his objections, he is re-
sponsible to tbe law, to all its penalties, and, like
every Representative ofaStateora district, he is
responsible also to the peopJe. These are the great
checks of our system; and ihey are serving the
mest important end for which they have been es-
tablished, when tney restrain the licentious ambi-
tion which i  chafed only by constitutions, by laws,
or by the popular will.
For the first time in the history of our institu-
tion , toey are exposed to a novel experiment It
is, nevertheless, one contemplated by the Constitu-
tion. It ss to be tried under very peculiar circum-
stances. It reaiains to be seen whether a Vice
President, cslled, in the regular order of events, to
the chief executive office, can administer the Gov-
ernment without a party pledged in advance to ap
prove or to oppose hi  administration, or, in oiher
words, whether the vigor and security of our Gov
ernment abide in the Constitution and laws, or in a
mere party With regard to the constitutional
convictions of the present incumbent of the execu-
tive ofhee, on some of the subjects to which they
have been applied, it is undoubtedly true that they
were known to those by whom he was nominated
and elected to the second office of the Government,
and by many of whom he is now bitterly de-
nounced for being what they, in the election, pro-
claimed him to be. With regard to the exercise of
the veto power m this instance, a recurrence to a
few facts of public notoriety and recent date will
enable an impartial public to decide.
Before the death of the late President, his proc-
lamation had issued, convening Congress in extra
session The necessity for this was alleged to ex-
ist in the state of our finances. Congress assem-
bled on the 3Ut of May, 1841. It has been in
session, with the interval of rather more than two
month's, ever since. Various expedients were re-
sorted to, during the extra session, to enable the
Government to meet its engagements and defray
Ik ordinary current expenses Since that period,
the pay of the army, the navy, and the civil list,
has been frequently suspended, from the utter
destitution of the treasury. Loans authorized by
Congress have failed to be negotiated on any
terms Treasury notes of Government have de-
preciated, and been returned by the needy public
creditor under protest. Every device to sustain
the sinking credit of the Government, short of a
direct lax, has failed, and thi«, at a period when
our foreign relations were eminently precarious
The distribution of the proceeds of the pubi c
lands from the treasury of the United States to the
treasuries of the States was among Ihe earliest
measures urge 1 at the extra session A loan for
$12,060,000 had been aathonzed for the relief of
the national treasu.y, but not negotiated, when a
bill distributing the proceeds of the public lands
passed both House? of Congress, and, with the ap
probation of the Executive, became a law. It
contained a clause without which it could never
have obtained either the legislative or the execu
tive sanction, providing, m view of the embai-
¡rassed condition of the treasury, that, whenever the
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
duties on any article of foreign importation ex
ceeded 20 per cent, the distribution to the S a'es
should cease, and the proceeds of the lands should
again be applied to pay the debts and defray the
expenses of the Federal Government A revenue
bill also passed at the extra session, raising the du-
ties on most articles which were free under the
compromise of 1833 to 20 per cent Th s bill was
framed with the design to avoid any conflict with
the 20 per cent, principle of the compromise of
1833, or with the 20 per cent, condition in the dis
tribution act.
At the commencement of the piesent session,
the President, in his annual message, apprized
Congress lhat there would be a deficit in the treas-
ury on tbe 1st of January, 1842, of $637 557 90
At a subsequent penod of this session, he urged on
Congress, in a special message, the inability of the
treasury to meet the demands created against it by
appropriations which Congress had made, the ne-
cessity of providing adequate means lo sustain
the Government by an increase of duties on im-
ports and every other means within their power.
He also recommended the repeil of the distribu-
tion act, and a pledge of the land fund for the
redemption of the public debt Though less than
half of the $12,000,000 loan authorized by the act
of 1841 bad been taken, and though Congress
found itself under the necessity, at an early penod
of this session, of au'horjzmgan issue of $5,000,000
of treasury notes, in addition to the loan of
$19,000,000, yet no revenue bill was reported until
the 3d day of June, 1842, after Congress had been
in session six months, and when the country was
looking anxiously for an adjournment Congress
had gone on meanwhile to appropriate many mil-
lions of dollars, which the Government did not
possess, and which it could not obtain without the
agency of the Legislative Department Tbe rev-
enue bill was reported on the 3d of June, and
taken up, for the first time, in Committee of the
Whole, on the 8th of June
The final reduction of duties to 20 per cent un-
der the compromise of 1833, was to take effect on
the 30 h of June, and then the distribution under
the act of 1841 was to commence, provided the
duties were not raised beyond 20 per cent. On the
7th of June, the Committee of Ways and Means,
which had reported the revenue bill on the 3d,
brought in what was called a provisional bill, the
ostensible object of which was to provide for a
temporarv collection of duties until time could be
afforded for the passage of the general revenue bill
The necessity for some such measure was alleged
to exist, on account of a doubt whether duties could
be collected after the 30th of June, without addi-
tional legislation The revenue bill provided for a
general increase of duties beyond 20 per cent, and
its passage would necessarily have enforced the
suspending clause of the distribution act The pro-
visional bill reported on the 7th of June, contained
no reference to this suspending clause of the distri
bution act A second provisional bill was reported
from the Committee of Ways and Means, with the
same general objects as the first, which had been
reported only two days before, and wiih a proviso
repealing the suspending clause of the distribution
act The first provisional bill was never consid
ered The second was passed by the House on tbe
15th June, went to the Senate, returned Tilth
amendment, wh ch were concurred in on the 25tn
of June, and was returned by the President, with
objections, on tbe 29 h of June These objections
were fuundei on the deplorable condition of the
treasury, and on the expediency of adhering, under
the circumstances, to the terms on which distnbu
tion had been authorized by tbe act of 1841 The
revenue bill did not pass until the 5th of August
It was returned, with the President's objections, on
ihe 9th.
The e objectioBs are now before the committee
They are substantially the same as those whicu
accompanied ihe provisional bill the 29th of June
The revenue bill contained a clause most wequivo
cally repealing the suspension of tbe distribution
act, which its own passage would have enforced
and thus it was, in effect, the enactment of a new
distribution ¡aw, appended to the revenue bill.
Each House deliberately refused to strike ou'
*                 %
this clause, and persisted in associating, in ludi-
crous contrast, two measures—the oae, an act to
raise money for the support of Government by the
imposition of taxes, the other, to distribute the
land revenues to the States The msjonty of both
Houses had proclaimed, with the concurrence of
the President, in September, 1841, that distribution
should only be made when the duties were below 20
per cent The majority of both Houses had again
and again proclaimed, in 1842, the necessity of
raising the duties above 20 per cent, and yet in-
sisted on distributing the land fund, without regard
to the conditions they themselves had so recently
prescribed—without regard to the situation of the
treasury—and without regard to the burdens which
might be imposed on the people. They might
have attempted to raise revenue Irom imposts,
and to distribute the land fund, in separate bills.
Then each measure would have rested on its own
intrinsic merits But they persisted in connecting
them in one bill The ¡estriction in the distribu-
tion act of 1841 was designed to guard against in-
creasing tbe burdens of taxation, to fi.l a vacuum
which might be occasioned by distribution. The
legislation of 1842 is designed to create a vacuum,
that it may be filled by increased taxation There
is probably no precedent in the history of any Gov-
ernment, for the union, under such circumstances,
of a revenue and an appropriation bill. As there
was no necessity for such union apparent to the
public, we are at liberty to infer that it resulted
from a consciousness that one or both the measures
could not have separately commanded a majority.
The exigencies of the national treasury were sup-
posed to furnish a favorable opportunity for Con-
gress to extort terms on which alone the Govern-
ment should be supplied with revenue to meet their
own appropriations It would have been as propar,
under ihe circumstances, for Congress to annex a
charter for a bank, or a fiscal agent, or a fiscal cor-
poration, as a condition precedent toa revenue bill;
and to raise an issue with the President or with
their constituents, if such a bill had not received
the Executive sane ion
It is a great mistake to suppose that this is an
issue between the majority of Congress and the
President There is an ís^ue between this same
majority in 1841 and 1842. The President abides
by terms which this majority prescribed for them-
selves and the treasury in 1841, and they can pre-
fer no accusation against him for adhering to their
own posit.on He might, with more propriety,
upraid them for aoandomng it. The issue is be-
tween this majority and the country They who
arraign the President for obstructing the will of
Congress, should be well assured that Congress
does not obs'ruct the will of the States and the peo-
ple it represents Congress is neither infallible nor
irresponsible. If this were a question in which
none felt any interest besides the President of the
United States and the members of Congress, there
might be some plausibility in the attempt to nar-
row the issue to them; but the subject of revenue
is one in which those who pay, are apt to feel as
deep an interest as those who levy taxes, Every
cit z"n of the United States, moreover, feels a so-
licitude in the Government, and all that concerns
i, 'n th  fundamental principles on which it is
based, in the measures which characterize its ad-
m lustration, in its justice, its faith, and its fame;
aid tbe judgment of no impartial man can be
blmd d or biased by the effort to coiceal the true
po n's of this issu , under cover of a petty political
al creation between a party majority in Congress
and tbe President.
