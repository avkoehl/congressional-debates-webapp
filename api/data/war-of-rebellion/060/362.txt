HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA,January 7, 1864-8 p. m.

Governor BOREMAN, Wheeling:

A dispatch just received from Colonel Thoburn, commanding at Petersburg, informs me that the rebel force threatening him for several days past retreated toward the Shenandoah Valley. The force was a formidable one, consisting of three brigades-Fitz. Lee's, Walker's, and Rosser's, all under the command of General Fitzhugh Lee. Deserters report that it was the intention of Lee to capture the garrison at Petersburg, take New Creek and Cumberland, destroy our stores, break the railroad by burning the bridges, &amp;c. I am happy to inform you that the great-raid undertaken by General Early, in retaliation for our late movement in this department, has thus far resulted in a complete failure or fizzle. An empty wagon train of Colonel Thoburn's, returning from Petersburg, was captured by a portion of the enemy's forces. With his exception they have not thus far been able to inflict upon us any injury. Many deserters are coming in, and our cavalry are picking up many stragglers. The railroad is safe; trains are running regularly. Weather very cold; snow several inches deep.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, January 7, 1864-9 p. m.

Brigadier-General SULLIVAN, Harper's Ferry:

Have you any news from your cavalry? Just received dispatch from Colonel Thoburn at Petersburg. Lee's forces have all retreated toward the Shenandoah Valley. They have suffered terribly. A great many deserters. Thus far Early's great raid has been a fizzle. Weather cold; snowing fast. I am not well; taken a severe cold.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, January 7, 1864-4 p. m.

Brigadier-General AVERELL, Martinsburg:

The troops arriving from Harper's Ferry were sent to General Sullivan, and will remain in his division for the present. I will send the Eight [West Virginia] to you as soon as I can get cars, and the Eleventh [West Virginia] as soon as shoed and ready. I will send the First [West Virginia) by way of Romney and Cacapon bridge. Keep your command as much in readiness as possible for any emergency. It is not to be expected that Early will go back without attempting something further, as thus far it has been a perfect fizzle.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
