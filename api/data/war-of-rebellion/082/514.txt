HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,July 27, 1864-6 p. m.

General MEADE:

I have been engaged this p. m. in trying to find the enemy's force. As far as I went did not find it. General Sheridan informs me he found it beyond the Charles City road. I had not force nor time enough to develop to that point. Wherever I struck the enemy's line I found his infantry. We also attacked the James end, but after a short contest we found the line did not end. We found hi in rifle-pits and in force; also attacked farther to the left and found them in rifle-pits; did not persist. General Foster informs me that a prisoner taken to-day says that several brigades crossed the James this a. m. and are now in front. I will await your orders. General Sheridan can only go out on the Bottom's road.

[Major- General HANCOCK:]

The enemy commenced re-enforcing from Petersburg only about an hour and a half ago. They have thus far sent twenty-nine car-loads. General Butler says that before these, which cannot yet have reached your front, he doubts if any re-enforcements have been made.
