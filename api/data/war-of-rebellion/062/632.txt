directly or through General Curtis, that I have agreed to refer any question of jurisdiction here to the War Department, I have to state that it is not true, for the very good reason that there is nothing at issue between ut. I am in command of this district, which is in Arkansas, and the troops in it, under orders of Major-General Steele.

Respectfully,

JNO. M. THAYER,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, Washington, D. C.:

It is the national interest and that of humanity to have the inhabitants of the southern tier of counties in this State plant their corps. We cannot give them protection because we cannot subsist our animals along the line of the State. To give it, the guerrillas must be driven from North Arkansas, or we must occupy that part of it where there is forage and where we can transport supplies by water. This matter is for consideration in connection with my letter to the Secretary of War, but it must at all events be decided that the guerrillas must be driven south of the Arkansas, or that we occupy North Arkansas from this department, or the southern border counties of Missouri must be left vacant.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, Washington, D. C.:

In connection with my application for two brigadiers for duty in my department, I request that General Thomas Ewing, jr., now in this city, be ordered by telegraph to report to me. He is at present under orders to report to General Curtis, but General Curtis telegraphs me that his services can be spared in his department for quieting border troubles.

Brigadier General THOMAS EWING,

Odin, Ill.:

Let General Rosecrans know when General Sherman will arrive, and he will, if possible, meet him with you.

Major and Aide-de-Camp.
