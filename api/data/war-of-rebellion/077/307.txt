The command marched a distance of 350 miles, a great part of the way being over very broken and barren country affording but little forage of water. With great difficulty the animals were supplied with about three-quarters of forage, consisting principally of wheat and oats in shear. For the more minute details of the expedition I refer you to the accompanying reports of my regimental commanders.
