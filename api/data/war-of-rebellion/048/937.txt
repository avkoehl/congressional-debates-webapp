HEADQUARTERS EXPEDITION,Strasburg, December 12, 1863.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report my arrival here at 3 p. m. this day. Am encamped in an excellent position, just before reaching the town. Cavalry encamped on each of the other main roads. Command a little foot-sore, but very jolly and in the best of health and spirits. Colonel Boyd had picked up 10 prisoners, who go with this dispatch, together with various wagons.

There is no forage above Strasburg, but I hope to start with not exceeding 35 wagons, which is an improvement on 73. Colonel Boyd's information as to forces in the valley coincides with the statements in the papers sent me, which were received last night. I think there is nothing now in the valley which cannot very easily be taken care of. The only contingency of danger I can imagine is the crossing of a force into our rear as we go up. In that case I might be obliged to go home by rail.

The cavalry burned a furnace to-day, and will try other means to-morrow to annoy the enemy and turn his attention in this direction. We are having a warm rain, which is better than a cold one.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

GEO. D. WELLS,

Colonel, Commanding.

Captain WILLIAM M. BOONE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Strasburg, December 13, 1863.

CAPTAIN; I have the honor to report some slight skirmishing in our front to-day with the pickets. The First New York went into Woodstock to-day, and captured 12 prisoners-7 (infantry) of Ewell's corps, who report themselves as having been sent into the valley on detached service, and 5 cavalry of Major O'Ferrall's battalion. The forage train arrived safely to-night; the wagons and prisoners will go to-morrow.

Some citizens state that Imboden has recently been re-enforced; also that the enemy intend occupying the valley immediately, in force. So far we have only Gilmor, White, and O'Ferrall, with their battalions. They have been running against our pickets to-day. Everything is well.

Since writing the above, Colonel Boyd reports 10 prisoners, making 22 to-day.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

GEO. D. WELLS,

Colonel, Commanding.
