have been received. One from General Heth asking for the bodies of two officers buried within our present lines. These bodies were found and delivered on the picket-line under a flag. The second was General Finegan, also asking for a body. It was ascertained the officer referred to was not dead, but was at City Point, wounded. An answer to that effect was sent to General Finegan. The provost-marshal's report, this morning shows forty-nine deserters as having been received during the preceding twenty-four hours. Nothing of importance elicited from them.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Deserters from Bushrod Johnson's division report that a dispatch was yesterday received to the effect that Columbia was in our possession, our cavalry in Winnsborough, and that Charleston had been evacuated. I forward this for what it is worth.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., February 20, 1865.

(Received 12.30 p. m.)

Major-General MEADE:

Rebel papers of Saturday gave full particulars of Sherman's entrance into Columbia on the morning of the 17th instant, and said they supposed the evacuation of Charleson had already commenced. I will have the bulletin prepared for Washington sent to you every evening hereafter. Deserters on Ord's front have been on the increase since the return of the Peace Commissioners; they have been more numberous on his front than on yours so far.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 20, 1865-1 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I congratulate you most heartily on the successful working of your plans, as proved by the evacuation of Charleston and the occupation of Columbia and Winnsborough. I shall be very much obliged to you for your promised copy of the daily bulletin made up from the Richmond journals.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

The firing now going [on] is our batteries shelling the enemy's working parties putting up abatis. The enemy replies.
