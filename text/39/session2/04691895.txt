one additional ration, valued at $108 annually,
for every five years of service, to ten per cent,
on the pay every five years, so that at the end
of forty years the pay would be increased eighty

at his discretion to furnish quarters to officers;
and if he should do so—and no doubt he would
do so for this city and other large cities—he
could not furnish such quarters for less than
the present commutation prices allowed for
quarters. The officers are allowed nearly three
thousand servants, and are allowed commuta-
tion for them if they are actually kept. The
enactment of this bill in its present form would
be a strong temptation to officers not to keep
servants, but to use soldiers for that purpose,
or, at any rate, to impose duties upon soldiers
which should be performed by servants. This
table shows the pay of officers at different
periods of service under the present system
and this proposed system: '
