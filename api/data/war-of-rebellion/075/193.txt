HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,May 15, 1864-12 m.

[General THOMAS;]

GENERAL: Rebels attacked very slightly Johnson's left, and our men responded very noisily, and that's all there is of it. Nobody hurt.

J. M. PALMER,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH CORPS,Jackson's Farm, Ga., May 15, 1864-12.30 a. m.

Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I reached the left in season to prevent the enemy turning it. He advanced on one brigade of mine and the First Indiana Battery with great violence, and was handsomely and successfully repelled. Prisoners state that it was Hood's corps. Had any considerable portion of my corps been in position I would have followed up the success.

To do it effectually in the morning, in my judgment, the advance should be on two lines, one along the line of railroad, the other along the Dalton and Resaca highway. All the troops should be in position by daylight. My position for to-night is on the high ground in the vicinity of where Morris' Creek crosses the Dalton road.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH CORPS,May 15, 1864-7.10 a. m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding Twenty-third Corps:

GENERAL: As the operations of our corps are somewhat dependent upon each other, I request that you will inform me where and how you propose to hold your command during our preliminary operations this morning. From the best information I can gather, the enemy is in force to my left, between the railroad and the Dalton and Resaca road. My headquarters for the present are at the crossing of the last-named road and unnamed creek on official map, about two miles from Tilton.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,May 15, 1864-8.40 a. m. (Received 9.30 a. m.)

Major-General HOOKER,

Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I will hold my command in reserve near your left rear during the preliminary movements of this morning. I will be at your headquarters in about an hour.

Respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
