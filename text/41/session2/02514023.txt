1870.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
their hard earnings to pay it off at the rate of
$100,000,000, at which rate taxation has been
exacted of them for so many months.
In looking at the annual report of the Secre-
tary of the Treasury—and I make my argument
from official statements, not calculating upon
an increase of receipts or decrease of expend-
itures—we find that he estimates the receipts
for the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1871, at
5>3i)3,000,000 and the expenditures at $291,-
000.000, leaving thusa balance in theTreasury
of $102,000,000. The chairman of the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means, and some of his
colleagues, in addressing the House yesterday
estimated the reduction of taxation by this bill,
in round numbers, at $34,000,000; this sum,
including the reduction in the receipts from
the income tax of $5,000,000, coming from the
proposed increase of the exemption from $1,000
to $1,500. Now, the receipts from all income
taxes, according to the returns for the fiscal
year ending 30th June, 1SG9, were over thirty-
four million dollars.
Mr. INGERSOLL. Not from the kind of
income tax we are dealing with in connection
with this bill. The receipts from personal
income were but $25,000,000.
Mr. O'NEILL. The receipts from all in-
comes and salaries were for the year ending
June 30, 1869, §34,791,856 exactly. This
amount,, of course, includes the tax on bank
dividends, and on the dividends and interest
on railroad stocks and bonds, and on all such
investments where the tax is paid before the
holders receive their dividends and .interest,
amounting to a little over nine million dollars;
thus leaving the amount of the actual personal
income tax paid by the individual during that
fiscal year §25,000,000.
So, taking the estimates of the Secretary of
the Treasuiy of receipts for the year ending
June 30, 1871, at $303,000,000 and the ex-
penditures at $201,000,000, we have his balance
on hand of $102,000,000 ; deduct from that
the reduction of the income tax as proposed
by the committee, by increasing the exemption
from $1,000 to $1,500, say $5,000,000, we
have $97,000,000; and deducting from that
the other reductions proposed by the commit-
tee, say $29,000,000, it leaves $08,000,000;
and then by the entire repeal of the income
tax, the balance of which (having already de-
ducted the $5,000,000 reduction of the com-
mittee,) say $20,000,000, and the result is
$48,000,000 at the end of the next fiscal year
to be devoted to the extinguishment to that
amount of the national debt. I think to this
amount we might add about thirteen million
dollars, which amount I believe will be about
the reduction made by the Committees on
Appropriations of the House and Senate from
the estimates of the different Departments;
thus leaving in the Treasury $01,000,000 ; but
as all the appropriation bills have not become
laws, I merely state this.
Mr. Speaker, I am advocating the repeal of
the income tax because, as 1 said before, it
was oppressive and burdensome and unneces-
sary. I feel in this that I am representing my
constituents and am striving to legislate for
the interests of the country. Those who hon-
ored me with a seat in Congress never failed
to pay their quota of taxation, and never will;
but 1 can truly say of them, while thus they
have met every demand of the Government,
that they are looking to us for relief from this
tax and are sincerely hoping for its repeal. 1
shall cheerfully vote for it.
[Here the hammer fell.]

obtained additional leave of absence for thirty
days.
Mr. VOORHEES obtained leave of absence
for ten tlajs from to-day.
Mr. COX obtained leave of absence for one
week iroin to day.
Mr. CAKE obtained leave of absence until
the 15th instant.
Mr. WHEELER obtained leave of absence
from to-day until Tuesday morning next.
WITHDRAWAL OF PAPERS.
Mr. SffOKES by unanimous consent, ob-
tained leave to withdraw from the files of
the Committee of Claims the papers in the
case of John A. Jackson.
INTERNAL TAX BILL.
The House resumed the consideration of the
internal tax bill.
Mr. WILSON, of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker,
the Committee of Ways and Means have ar-
rived at the conclusion that by this bill they
can reduce taxation §34,000,000. Repeal the
income tax and you at once absorb all the
reduction proposed to be made. We will then
have gentlemen opposing any of the reduction
proposed in the other parts of the bill. To the
extent of every dollar stricken off in this man-
ner we are prevented from seeking relief in
lower tariff duties. The protectionists earn-
estly favor reduction in this and all internal
taxation, to create a necessity for perpetuating
their onerous and unjust system. They would
have their incomes increased to a princely sum
by retaining the taritl, and escape just taxation
thereon by striking out this section.
1 am one of those who favor a much larger
reduction of taxes than is proposed in this bill.
We can reduce $75,000,000. We can relieve
the people to that amount and still carry on the
Government ill a proper manner. I had hoped
that this reduction might have been made in
the tariff, but that has failed. The recom-
mendation of the President, that the people
should groan on under this class of burdens,
has been carried out. The high duties upon
tea, coffee, sugar, clothing, iron, salt, and all
the necessities of life must still be paid by the
poor. Their demand for relief has been refused,
and what do we offer them in return ? Out of
forty millions it is proposed to lift the burdens
from one hundred and seventy-five thousand
people, with incomes ranging from $1,500 to
$1,000,000.
What aspect will we present to our constitu-
ents when all we have done to reduce taxation
lias been solely in the interest of the rich
classes, when we have legislated for capitalists
alone ? What appearance will wc present when
we go before them and they tell us, " You have
voted for a proposition which relieved each one
of you from $200 tax which you were paying on
your own salaries, the President from $1,200,
and each member of the Cabinet from $350,
and your Speaker lrom the same amount
This Congress will, by striking out this sec-
tion, put in its own pocket over sixty thousand
dollars from salaries alone, to say nothing of
the much larger amount saved by the many
wealthy members who have other sources of
income.
Mr. ARCHER. That is a tax on salaries.
The income tax does not apply to any of the
class the gentleman names.
Mr. WILSON, of Minnesota. Ihe gentle-
man is mistaken ; there is no_ distinct law tax-
ing salaries. The repeal of this law leaves
them free. Gentlemen speak pathetically of the
poor men who only receive $l,500ayear. Out
in the country where I live, in the whole west-
ern country, we consider a man in a good con-
dition if ho is receiving $1,500 salary; and
the recipients of a few hundred moreaie per-
fectly willing to pay the small amount of tax
which falls to their share. Our grumblers
and complainers are those who are the most
wealthy and the best able to pay.
Now.whatare the arguments brought forward
here in favor of abolishing this tax ? They tell
you that it is inquisitorial, and. they tell you
that there are frauds connected with the returns.
Are there more frauds than in returns of per-
sonal property for State taxation? lhat is
no reason for repeal, and it should not be
adduced as an argument. It is trying to take
advantage of their own wrong. I believe that
this is one of the fairest taxes that is imposed;
fair, because it falls upon the rich man and
does not touch the poor; fair, because it
makes the large incomes of the manufacturer
and money-lenders bear a part of their share
of the national burdens, as against the tariff
taxes which go abroad all over the country and
oppress the poorer classes. It is fair because
it is the duly mode by which we will reach tbe
untaxed holder of Government bonds ; fair,
because it reaches a large class of salaried
people who escape all State taxation. Speak-
ing for my own State, and what I believe is the
sentiment of a majority of the country, I hope
this section will be retained.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. TO WNSEND. Mr. Speaker, the clamor
in favor of the abolition of the income tax is a
local and a manufactured cry. It does not
come from the masses of the people. 'It ori-
ginated in the great cities, among the men of
gigantic capital, among the railroad monop-
olists, brokers and dealers in stocks, wholesale
importers, mostly foreigners, and men of co-
lossal fortunes and extraordinary incomes. It
was started by papers in their interest, and is
mostly confined to those places and persons.
It has not spread to the country, and the coun-
try papers and the country people do not de-
mand the abolition of the tax. This tax is
confined to comparatively few individuals. I
hold in my hand a letter from Mr. Douglas, the
acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
which reads as follows :
Treasury Department,
Office ov Internal Kevknue.
Washixgton, May 18,1870,
Sir: In reply to your letter of tbo 17th instant,
asking for the number of persons assessed for income,
and the amount, of ineomc assessed in tho United
States in three designated classes, I have the honor
to state that tbe only returns made to this, office by
assessors on this subject, from tho animal list for
3809, weie tho number of persons assessed for income
iu each of the following classes:
JSuiyiber
aSHcwctl.
First class, $1,400 or less 
Second class, over SI,400 and not over ¥2,000... 09,184
Third class, over $2,000 and not over $3,0(J0,.„ 41.19b
Fourth class, over S3,000 and not over $11,000.. 45,002
Filth class, over $11,000   '-MO*
Total number of persons assessed  272,843
The aggregate inconio tax collected on the annual
list for 1869 has been estimated at $27,230,000. It will
probably, when all returned, slightly excecd that
amount. Assuming that to be tho aggregate, bow-
ever, the proportion paid by the dillerent classes
would probably be substantially as follows :
First class  $1,019,900 $32,398,000
Second class  2,707 4(10 55,348,000
Thi?d cla«s   3,419,300 08,380,000
Fourth class   12,600,000 2)2,012,000
Fifth clas-i........!  6,842,800 138,850,000
Total  627,250,000 $515,000,000
Very respectfully, JT. W, DOUGLAS, .

Hon. Vf. TowNSEXn, . .
llou^e of J!epre«cntatives, U. O.
From this letter it appears that tlie whole
number of persons who paid income tax on
the annual list of 1809 was 272,843, aud the
whole amount of tax collected was about
§27,250,000.
Of this number of persons 177,181 were as-
sessed ou incomes not over £>2,000, and paid
taxes amounting to $4,387,300, while the
remaining 95,002 persons paid the remainder,
or 022.802,700. If we raise the exemption
to §2,000 we will relievo a large number of
persons, such as clerks, book-keepers, sales-
men, and professors in learned institutions,
and other persons of limited means, on wno.n
this tax is a burden, and who have to pay it
out of their living, thereby depriving them ot
some of the necessaries of lite, and we
tax only those who are in the enjoyment o
good incomes, and who will pa7 ta/; out
of their surplus, and not out ol their livin0.
