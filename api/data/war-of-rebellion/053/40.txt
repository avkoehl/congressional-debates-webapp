FORT DUNLAP, October 2, 1863-12 m.

Brigadier-General WOOD,

Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: A heavy column of infantry has been passing from the enemy's right to his left for the past hour on top of Missionary Ridge. The head of the column is lost in the timber. Have not appeared yet in the valley.

Respectfully, sir,

J. L. YARYAN,

Aide-de-Camp.

OCTOBER 2, 1863.

Brigadier-General WOOD,

Comdg. First Division, Twenty-first Army Corps:

GENERAL: About a brigade of the enemy moved along the top of ridge until they reached the unpainted house east of Fort Dunlap, where they filed right, and I think marched down the ridge on the other side. The works southeast of the fort have been added to considerably. The number of troops in the valley appears increased. I can see three brass guns at different points in the enemy's works.

The enemy have just commenced work on their fortifications on our left. There does not appear to be as many at work as usual.

Respectfully,

L. M. DE MOTTE,

Lieutenant and Acting Signal Officer.

OCTOBER 2, 1863.

Brigadier-General WOOD:

Sixteen regiments of infantry, two batteries of artillery have moved along the top of the ridge in direction of our right. They were without baggage, and had but few ambulances. The head of a column of infantry is seen coming down the ridge near fortifications southeast of the fort, and directly opposite General Palmer's front. I do not think it the same column I have seen moving on the top of the hill,

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

L. M. DE MOTTE,

Lieutenant and Signal Officer.

Respectfully, yours,

L. M. DE MOTTE,
