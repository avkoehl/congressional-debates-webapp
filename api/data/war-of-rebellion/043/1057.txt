REPORT OF Colonel PENNOCK HUEY, EIGHTH PENNSYLVANIA CAVALRY, COMMANDING SECOND BRIGADE, SECOND DIVISION.
HDQRS. SECOND BRIG., SECOND DIV., CAVALRY CORPS,JULY 27, 1863.

GENERAL: I HAVE THE HONOR TO REPORT THAT A PATROL, CONSISTING OF 1 SERGEANT AND 4 MEN, OF A SQUADRON OF THE SECOND NEW YORK CAVALRY, ON OUTPOST DUTY NEAR CEDAR RUN, WAS ATTACKED BY GUERRILLAS AT ABOUT 1 O'CLOCK TO-DAY, NEAR THE HOUSE OF A MR. RICHARD COLVIN, ABOUT 5 MILES FROM THESE HEADQUARTERS, ON THE ROAD LEADING TO BRENTSVILLE. AS SOON AS INFORMATION OF THE ATTACK REACHED THE RESERVE, THEY WERE PROMPTLY TURNED OUT AND REPAIRED TO THE SCENE OF ACTION, AND AN ORDERLY SENT TO THESE HEADQUARTERS TO REPORT THE FACT, WHEREUPON ANOTHER SQUADRON WAS IMMEDIATELY SENT OUT TO SUPPORT THE ONE ALREADY THERE. SUBSEQUENTLY, PARTIES WERE SENT OUT TO PATROL THE COUNTRY AS FAR AS HARROW OR HARRISON'S FORD (ON THE OCCOQUAN), BRENTSVILLE, AND ELKTON. THE PATROLS HAVE JUST RETURNED, AND HAVE FAILED IN SECURING ANY OF THESE GUERRILLAS OR ELICITING ANY DEFINITE INFORMATION IN REGARD TO THEIR WHEREABOUTS. EVERY POSSIBLE EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO DISCOVER THESE MEN. HOUSES WERE SEARCHED, AND ALL CITIZENS AND NEGROES MINUTELY INTERROGATED, BUT NO INFORMATION OBTAINED. A YOUNG GIRL, AT THE HOUSE OF MR. COLVIN, STATED THAT YESTERDAY 3 CITIZENS AND 4 SOLDIERS (SOUTH CAROLINA TROOPS) PASSED THERE AT ABOUT 5 P. M. THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING ACROSS THE RIVER, AND THAT FOR SEVERAL DAYS PAST SMALL SQUADS OF CONFEDERATES PASSED THERE. THE IMPRESSION PREVAILS AMONG THE OFFICERS WHO WERE SENT OUT THAT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THESE GUERRILLAS IS SOME POINT IN THE VICINITY OF BRENTSVILLE. CASUALTIES ARE AS FOLLOWS, VIZ: PRIVATE COLE, COMPANY F, SECOND NEW YORK CAVALRY, CAPTURED (HORSE FOUND WOUNDED); PRIVATE DENNIS, COMPANY F, SECOND NEW YORK CAVALRY, CAPTURED (HORSE FOUND WOUNDED).

RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED.
