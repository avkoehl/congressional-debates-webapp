SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 12, 1863-1 p.m.

Brigadier-General TOTTEN:

The Minnesota regiments have arrived. I can send you one if you need it or can make good use of it. I do not want to send them away unless it be necessary, for fear they may be required in other parts of the State. If the rebels succeed in crossing the river, infantry will be much needed there.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, October 12, 1863-1.15 p.m.

Brigadier-General TOTTEN:

Dispatch just received from Guitar informs me that the rebels were retreating from Boonville at 7.30 this morning. Brown was in hot pursuit, skirmishing with rebel guard. Major Leonard was crossing to join in the pursuit. The direction of the rebel retreat is not stated. Have you heard anything of Lieutenant Colonel Quin Morton? He moved on the 9th from Lebanon, and is sure to have crossed the Osage. Find where he is, if possible.

J. M. SCHOFIELD.

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, October 12, 1863

Brigadier-General TOTTEN:

Ascertain and inform me as soon as possible what direction the rebels took from Boonville.

Brigadier-General TOTTEN:

I think it would be well to send the force to Tuscumbia.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 12, 1863

Brigadier-General TOTTEN:

I have heard nothing of Brown since this morning. Probably you had better send rations on the railroad toward the La Mine, where Brown's troops and others can get them. I will s end up some more infantry in the morning.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

General Ewing left Sedalia this evening toward Boonville, to try to co-operate with Brown. If you learn where Brown is, or where the rebels are going to, inform Ewing by express from Tipton.
