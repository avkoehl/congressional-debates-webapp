The last order to me was to send you to Everettsville, and the orderly says you have been ordered by General Slocum to Cox's Bridge. If so, keep south as far as practicable to get there.

Lieutenant Colonel H. W. PERKINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Twentieth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that I am encamping at this point, which is on the Goldsborough new road, three miles from Newton Grove Post-Office. I was delayed four hours in reaching here by the Fifteenth Corps, the rear of which did not pass this point until 6 p. m. My position here is excellent, enabling me to cover the trains securely. I send this by Captain Schilling, of my staff, who will give all explanations called for and will bring back any instructions you may wish to send.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN W. GEARY,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
