the committee I ask the Senate to indulge me
in one observation.

minute.

If the Senator wishes to make any observation's
in connection with the pending bill he can do so.

BILL RECOMMITTED!
Mr. SAWYER. I ask the indulgence of the
chairman of the Committee on Finance and
the Senator from Connecticut to call up a bill
for the purpose of having it recommitted. It
will excite no debate. It is the bill (S. No.
252) to provide for the sale of certain lots and
lands of the sea islands of Beaufort county,
South Carolina, and for other purposes. I
move that it be recommitted to the Committee
on Public Lands.
The motion was agreed to.
TUB CURRENCY.
The Senate resumed the consideration of the
bill (S. No. 378) to provide a national currency
of coin notes and to equalize the distribution
of circulating notes, the pending question
being on the amendment of Mr. Morton, which
was to strike out " $45,000,000," in line three
of the first section, and insert " $52,000,000;"
so as to read : "That $52,000,000 in notes for
circulation may be issued to national banking
associations," &c.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senatorfrom
Connecticut [Mr. Bitckisgham] is entitled to
the floor.
Mr. BUCKINGHAM. Mr. President, I
propose to speak upon the subject of banking
and of public credit, questions intimately con-
nected with the subject that is now under con-
sideration. I should like to speak to two texts.
I will take the bill introduced by the distin-
guished chairman of the Committee on Finance
[Mr. Sherman] for one, and Senate bill No.
444, now lying upon your table, for the other.
I will ask the Secretary to read that bill as
a part of my remarks.
The Secretary read the bill, as follows:
A bill supplementary to an act to provide a na-
tional currency secured by a pledge of United
States bonds, and to provide for the circulation
and redemption thereof, approved June 3,1854.
Be it enacted by the Senite and House of Represent-
ative of the United States of America in Congress assem-

tal actually paid in, and all banking associations now

tion shall be less than - per cent, of the entire
indebtedness of the association exclusive of its cap-
ital : Provided, That nothing in this act shall be
regarded as prohibiting any association from paying
its circulating notes in coin on demand.
Mr. BUCKINGHAM. Mr. President, the
currency of the country, both bank and na-
tional, is and has for some time been incon-
vertible into coin. This irredeemable currency
has excited speculation, caused great and sud-
den changes in the nominal values of property,
and rendered business unstable and often un-
profitable and unsatisfactory. The fact that
the Government, and the banks have failed to
meet their obligations, that they are apparently
making little effort to fulfill them, but are
quietly waiting for aeon venient season, has done
much to erase from the minds of men the con-
viction that they are under obligations to meet
pecuniary promises at maturity. This disre-
gard of specific obligations has done much and
possibly more than any other one thing to cor-
rupt the morals and to impair the integrity of
the business community.
In order to sustain the Government we were
forced to issue a currency which all knew could
not be redeemed until the supremacy of the
Government should be reestablished. It has
been reestablished now more than four years,
and the currency remains unredeemed and the
people dishonored ; and it is high time that the
legislative branch of this Government should
gird itself to the duty of staying the evils to
which I have referred. Many claim that the
remedy is to be found only in an immediate
return to specie payments through a contrac-
tion of the currency, while others clamor foi
an increase of circulating notes as the only
means of avoiding general bankruptcy.
I believe that no remedy will be found until
our currency is convertible into coin at the
pleasure of the holder, but thiuk there is a
more excellent way than to contract it so mueh
and so suddenly as to throw all the engage-
ments of business men out of line and to un-
settle their well-devised plans. But an increase
of a circulating medium which bears a false and
unfulfilled promise upon its face instead of
being a remedy for any one of the evils which
1 have named would only increase and perpetu-
ate them. The more you issue of such promises
the more they will depreciate until they will
be as valueless as the notes of the southern
confederacy.
You would be like the loaded team going
down the mountain side. The load presses
heavily; you quicken the teats to escape the
pressure; the load follows closely with increas-
ing power; it controls the team; you now put
on the lash that the team may escape; but no,
you have lost control, and the destruction both
of team and load is made sure.
