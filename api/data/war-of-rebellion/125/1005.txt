or set of orders are given to all persons being transported to a single point. But even supposing it increases at a few important points the labor to the extent of an additional clerk, I am confident the additional expense would be saved many times over in a single week by the proposed change. As an example of the wrong constantly recurring, I inclose copy of a letter recently received from Captain Lewis, assistant quartermaster, at Cincinnati, on this subject.* It seldom happens that when any number of men are ordered to move all will go, or, when the distance is long, some are not left by the way. Experage percentage not moved in such cases to be large-say from 5 to 10 per cent; yet under the present practice the Government is liable to pay for all ordered to move, instead of all actually transported. To correct this evil the plan now suggested was adopted at Saint Louis more than two years ago and has been found to operate well in all respects. It is my design, as soon as leisure from current business of the office will permit, to prepare an abstract or copy of everything in the regulations, order of the War Department, Quartermaster-General's orders, and decisions bearing upon the subject of transportation, which may afford useful information to quartermasters, and also to prepare some uniform blanks and regulations in regard to freight transportation. As it will, however, require some little time to get all the necessary information, I think it desirable that the orders and rules for passenger transportation should be issued as early as consistent. In connection with the papers herewith transmitted, I inclose a report from General McCallum, general manager of military railroads, upon a letter of Captain J. V. Lewis, assistant quartermaster, which I some [time] since referred to him, requesting his views thereon.* It will be seen from the general's reply that we both agree as to the extent of the evil and the importance of a remedy, and that we agree in most points in regard to the remedy to be applied, the general's plan being more extensive and expensive than mine. If the present war were to continue for years on as broad a scale, it might be better to incur larger expenditures in this department. Having had my attention more particularly called to other details, and having had two years" experience, on a smaller scale, of the plan substantially as proposed by me, induces me to give it preference over that of General McCallum in points wherein we differ.

Very respectfully,

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel, in Charge Fourth Div., Quartermaster-General's Office.
