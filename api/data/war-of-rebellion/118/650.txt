2. Disloyal conduct since that period.

3. General reputation of the accused as to his sentiments and character, and as to whether he is or is not dangerous man in his neighborhood. Women who are violent and dangerous secessionists must be arrested as well as men.

4. You will not arrest persons who were at one time disloyal but have been permitted to remain among us on taking the oath of allegiance and giving bond, provided they have since observed their obligations in the best faith.

The slightest departure from good faith in this matter, acts or words that would not be noticed if spoken or committed by Union men, will be sufficient to cause the arrest of such persons. Active loyalty is required at the hands of all citizens. Those whose best claim to the protection of the United States Government is that they "have done nothing" are rebels. It is the duty of every man to do something to uphold his Government. In clear cases of disloyalty and in those only the prisoners and the proofs will be sent forward to you. Their cases will be disposed of here.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHESTER HARDING, JR.,

Colonel, Commanding District.

FORT MONROE, May 18, 1863.

FORT MONROE, May 18, 1863.

Colonel WILLIAM HOFFMAN:

Will Thomas Tait Tunstall, confined in the Old Capitol Prison, be sent? A pressing demand is made by Mr. Ould for Captain Clagett D. Fitzhugh and Captain George M. Shearer, who are said to be in Old Capitol Prison or Fort McHenry. The former was captured in July, 1862. Will they be delivered?

WM. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel, &c.

FORT MONROE, May 18, 1863.

Colonel W. HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners:

Will you please direct that all prisoners be paroled before leaving their places of detention and especially before embarking on any transport. Unless done in this latter case there is great danger that they may overpower the guard and run away with the vessel. I have had intimations of such intentions. Two transports left last night to bring away prisoners from Fort Delaware.

WM. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel, &c.
