the Coast Survey map of the city, on which the two points I have mentioned near Steam-Boat Point are marked X and Y.

Second P. S. - On another visit to Steam-Boat Point, made since the above was written, I find an excellent place for a water battery of six guns, which can be established at little expense. The place is marked Z on the Coast Survey map.

Approximate estimate of a parapet and magazine for a proposed battery of twelve guns on Beale street, made under the supposition that the earth is to be taken from the street, regardless of the city grade at that locality. If the earth is to be brought from a distance an additional expense will be required.

San Francisco, Cal., August 1, 1863.

Captain A. W. STARR,Second Cavalry California Volunteers, Chico, Cal.:

SIR: Your telegram of yesterday reporting your arrival at Chico has been received. It is the general's desire that you remain in the vicinity of Chico, giving all needful protection to whites from incursions of hostile Indians, and to friendly Indians, particularly, those residing on the ranches of citizens, against the brutish assaults of bad white men. The general desires you to consult frequently with Major Bidwell, both on account of his large experience in these difficulties and also from the fact that he is the representative of the Indian Department in that portion of the State. You will find the major reliable and truly loyal.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. DRUM.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
