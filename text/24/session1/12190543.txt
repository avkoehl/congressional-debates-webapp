the oihtr. He declared, upon his responsibility
Ih fore the House, and upon higher  c*ponsibihty
thin any he ian owe to this House, that he would
nliwrvi, not merely'he letter, but the t,inil of
í'if rule In what imnnir th s piomise «asa-

had happen  d fiom the Senate of the Urntul
Stites to tin office ot the National Intelligencer,"
and tin n quoting, with htenl fidelity, exprts-
Bions u-h dina debate of the Senate, he procei ded
to comment upon them in a tone which I foibear
to characters On the following diy the gen-
tleman in term pud tne remarUs, punir  nt and
conelusive as they weie, of the honorable mem-
l>er from Virgmii, [Mi Wist,] "to ejrplain "
In what he had said the day before he alludtd to
no t <f<riJtiaJ whalerei—lit haJ no person m his
mind, he only "ptrsoni/if<i a sentiment," and to
that personification lit addressed himself Such
was the expl ination Now , sir, it is not for me
to question the sincerity of the gentleman, how-
ever difficult I miv find it to com|ie'und the
distinction which he attempts Rut I must be
permitted to say if he was not leplyin^ to what
had been said in the S< nate, if he liad no refer-
ence to particular members of it, in his own lan-
guage " ill tint eloquence was gntuitous, and
all that indizn Uion wistt fully squandered away,"
and 1 may add, too, the time ol this House was
also wastefullv «quandeitd away He either
had reference, and pointed ufettnci, too, to i dis-
tinguished member of thit bod) , or he hid not
If he had, then he -violated as well the rules of
the Hous" is his promise to observe them in let-
ter and in spirit. If he had not, then was his
speech an effusion of unmeaning boiibast, aimed
at nothing, accomplishing nothing, proving noth-
ing but the ill-suppressed fee' lgs which prompt-
ed it The great business of the nation must
stop to allow the gt nt' mm to uin a tilt against
** the pcrsomjicahan rfa sentiment," and the House
exhibits the di-.?-accful spectaele of boisterous
applause at his t mcied suecess. in oveithrowing
a " personified sentiment'"
Mr  Sptafter, the honorable member, if I do
not wholly misunderstand him, chaiges the Sen-
ate with the ftilure of the bill at the 1 \st session,
containing the ordinary appropriations for forti-
fications; and, under this general head, he enters
into seveial specifications     He complains of the
temper of the Senate, of its indecorum and disre-
spect to the  House, manifested by its piompt
rejection of the three million appropriation, "icith
but little debate," of its adherence to that reaction,
and of its  message  to  the House in   the last
moments of its existence, reminding it of the
report of conferees, by which the bill could even
then  have  been  saved      He goes furthei:  he
assigns motites, and degrading motives, too, for
the action of the Senate, or rather of " those who
lead it," and he finds matter for grave complaint
and accusation, and for holding that body re-
sponsible to the country for the failure of the bill
in question     How  widely  different the same
objects appear to diffi rent minds'    We are all
liable to be swayed by passion and prejudice;
and no truth  is more  geneially acknowledged
thin that the powers of the intellect—the reason—
the understanding—are susceptible of the greatest
influence and the giossest pel version from the
qualities of the heart     Now, sir, to my mind,
the particulars which  the honorable gentleman
has singled out as pi oof that the Senate are le-
sponsible for the loss of the bill, are precisely
those which deinonstiate inconlroverlMy their ex-
treme solicitude and desire to pass it    What, in
few words, is the history of that bill5   It passed
the House some weeks before the close of the
session, in the usual form, making the ordinary
appropriations     Every attempt to increase the
sums appropriated by it was voted down by the
n ajonty of the House, under the lead of the
fn< nds  fthe \dmimstrition   Weof the minority
sti uggled for larger means of defense, but in vain.
The bill went to the Senate     Large and import-
ant additions were mide to it theie, under the
recommendation and estimates, as is understood,
oftho Executive Departments, and the bill passed,
and was returned to the House     So far, surely,
the Si nate are not ícsponsible for defeating the
ordinary   appropuation   for   fortifications   and
means of defense Their control over the bill
had ceisid It íested with the House, and the
House alone, so far as Congress was concerned,
whethei it should become a law It reposed
moie //¡an a ireeA. quietly upon the Speaker's table,
and until the last day, and very near the last hour
of the existence of that Congress, before its
slumbers weie broken At about eight o'clock
in the evening of the 3d day of March, it was
called up foi consideration No objection was
íaised to the amendments of the Senate, which
went to entalle the sums to be expended in forti-
fying exposed points of the country. But the
extiaordinary and unlooked-for pioposition was
nudi of appiopuating three million dollars, in
addition to all which had already been appropu-
nted foi specific objects, to be expended under
the direction of the President, and at Ins discretion,
in the military and naval service.                            |[
The minority of the House, opposed though
they were to arming the Piesident with the enoi-
mous and dangerous power—dangeious to the
peace of the country—which this giant of money
would have conferred, yet contented themselves
with a silent vote. The time was short They
wt re anxious that the bill should pass, and that
other bills then pending should pass also A
single speech would have defeated the proposed
amendment, but it would have defeated the bill
also, hence ro man raised his voice against it.
We permitted it to go thiough the Committee of
the Whole, and to pass the House, but we never
approved it We gave proof of the sincerity of
our desue to provide the ordinary means for de-
fense, in silently submitting to that extraoidtnary
and, as we viewed it, alarming proposition. The
bill went to the Senate. Objections were made to
this appropriation in the particular Jorm it stood,
resting chiefly, if not entirely, upon a question
of constitutional power as to appropriations so
indefinite and unlimited, and applicable to no
specific objects These objections, and the giounds
upon which they stood, were well known to the
i House; and the House might have obviated them
if it had been disposed. I do not say that they
weie or were not well founded. 1 do not touch
I that point     It is enough for me that Senators,
competent to judge, bound by their oath to sup- |
| port the Constitution, regarded them as fatal ob-
stacles It wis their province to determine lor
l themselves They had the same right, and lay
under the same high obligations to exercise then
judgments fairly and dispassionately, as pertained
to the House, and there is no reason to doubt
that they acted in obedience to their solemn con-
victions of dut/ That duty compelled them to
disagree to the amendment of the House, and
they fulfilled it promptly, and perhaps, as the
gentleman says, " with but little debate." The
House then insisted upon its amendment. The
next step of the Senate was to adhere to its dis-
agreement, passing over the intermediate stage of
insisting also Why was this' What is the fine
, reason for these prompt proceedings on the part
of the Senate' The gentleman sees in them
' nothing but disrespect, and indecorum, and inso-
lence, and a determination to defeat the bill More
time should have been taken, debate should have
been had, all the forms of pailiamentary etiquette
should have been observed' Why, sir,does not
the honorable gentleman recollect that the houis,
nay, the very minutes, of that Congress weie
numbered,and wpre fast wasting away'
In addition to its business of legislation, the
Senate was pressed with business of an execu-
tive characted, and every moment of its time was
actively employed Was that an occasion to stand
upon questions of mere punctilio and matters of
idle ceremony' No„sir, the Senate, entertaining
objections of a character which can never be aban-
doned by men who respect themselves'or deserve
the respect of others, but which might have been
obviated on the part of the House, lost none of
the time, more valuable then than all the prece-
dents of ceremony which the gentleman can find
in his labored researches, in bringing the subject
of disagreement to direct issue; and with all the
" indecent haste" they are accused of, a confer-
ence, the usual parliamentary mode of íeconcihng
disagreeing votes, was not obtained seasonably
to have reported, as is now contended,during the
life of that Congress.   To my mind these pro-
ceedings manifest an earnest solicitude to save
the bill lather than a willingness to defeat it The
Senate oveilooked all minor consideiations; dis-
legaided all inferior and subordinate matters, in
the great object of appropriating largely for works
of defense and secunty. They exposed them-
selves to this very chaige of precipitation and
indecorum, or what under other circumstances
roight be so considered, in then zeal to get the
bill so fiamed as to be acceptable to both Houses.
What could they do ' Compelled to vote for an
amendment which they regaided as unconstitu-
tional, and which they could not, therefore, under
any circumstances,agree to, or to see a measure
they were anxious to adopt perish before their
eyes, with no power to save it; how were they
to act' The steps taken by them, standing in
the emergency they did, were the only ones pos-
¡ sible by which the bill could have been rescued
from the destruction that awaited it, and if they
had been met by the House in a corresponding
temper, it would have become a law Hot  it failed
I shall consider piesently But,sir, "the message"
to which the gentleman refers, and upon which
he has expended his warmest indignation—what
was it' A message from the Senate " respectfully
to remind the House of the report of the com-
mittee of conference appointed on the disagree-
ing votes of the two Houses" in respect to the
foitifieation bill It may have been unusual and
without pieceüent, I do not dispute it. But that
it was insolent and contemptuous towards the
House, or was so designed, or so regarded, I
utterly deny If it was unusual and without
precedent, it was because the condition in which
the business between the Houses stood was neto
and without ptecedent Emergencies, extreme
cases, make their own precedents, and furnish
their own justification What was the condition
of the bill to which the message referred'
The two Houses had disagieed in íelation to
the thiee millions A committee of conference
had been appointed A report had been agreed
upon unanimously, as was then supposed, and
which it was not doubted would be satisfactory
to each House The chairman of the committee
of confeience [Mr Cambreleng] retained the
I papéis, with a view of making the report to the
House first, after which it was to be sent to the
Senate, and until thus sent the Senate had no
power over it A considerable time elapsed, and
no intelligence was received by the Senate from
this branch. Pew moments only remained The
bill was everywhere deemed of great importance
The report of the conferees, if adopted by the
Houses, would save it Nothing had been done
in this body, nor, as they feared, would be done,
upon the íeport of the conference. To meet a
state of things so new, so unusual, so extraordi-
nary, demanded new and unprecedented proceed-
ings Deeply solicitous for the passage of the
biU, the Senate, regardless of forms, not studious
of precise rules of ceremony, made a last effort
for its safety Surprised they doubtless were
tint the conferees on the part of the House, who
had so lately agreed in a repoit should fail to
present it, and that no information should be
affoidcd them of its final disposition In this
view of the matter, sir, I can perceive nothing in
that message against which the gentleman has
dnected his shai pest indignation, but a respectful
though eai nest intimation that the Senate was
ready to pass the bill in the shape which the
conferees appointed by the House had agieed to
recommend. Then could not do it until the papers
should besentto them Where was the disrespect
and the insolence of such an intimation > I con-
fess, sir, I have not a perception keen enough to
discern it One sinceiely seaiching for the truth
unheated by other consideiations, would not be
very apt, I think, to discover it
The honorable member has furnished us with
a history of the introduction of the three million
appropuation into the fortification bill He says
it was founded upon a resolution of the House
unanimously adopted on the preceding day, in
these words-
"ResoluJ That in the opinion of this House the treaty
will) Fnnee ol the 4th of Julv, 1831, should be maintained,
and its execution insisted on "
I perceive nothing in this leading to hostih-
'ies, and requmng measures, and extraordinary
