APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
27th CoNG""lsr Sess.
then includes debt and deficit together in one gross
sum, no where pointing out the amount of the
_debt, his method of reaching his total of "debt
and deficit" is surprisingly curious He includes
#4,000,000 for a balance to be kept m the Trea
sury. And we are now asked to borrow that sum,
and pay interest upon it, and expense of negotiat
ing the loan, that this, balance m«iy be put into the
coffers of a new fiscal Bank, to be- traded upon, or
serve the purposes of ^peculation to rfBccrs of the
Government, or to bankers and brokers, by being
placed in other Bank depositories.
A^ain He includes apptopnat'ons which are
called for by the pre ent Admims ration at this ex-
tra session, and wh'ch the late Administration did
not requ're for ihe urines of the year In other
words, to mate a deficit, he includes the sum of
$9,521,336, fcr what this Administration wishes
now to be authorized to expend It is capable o'
demonstration that under a prudent and economi-
cal administration of the Government, the means
were amply «sufficient for the service ot me year,
and that there was no nect ssity of this called ses-
sion for supplying tho*e means
By adding $4,000 000, the sum proposed to Le
kept in the Treasury, the Secretary calls h s esti-
mated deficit         -           -            #16,088,215 18
Deduct this sum, of which the Se-
cretary acknowledges there is no
necessity so long as the power to
issue Treasury notes exists      -   4,000 000 00

And we have       -           -            $12,088,215 18
Deduct Treasury notes payable next

And ihere remains   -           -   $6,000,941 14
Dtduct, further, the sum asked for
new appropriations of this session   2,521,326 98
Remainder               -                $3,479,604 16
A further deduction should be made
for means omitted by the Secre
tary—
Money in mints   -     #215,151 88
Treasury notes in-
cluded in the sum
of $1,110,611 08
as demands on this
year,  not due or
payable   till   the
next, and  which
will not come in
till then at least -   1,000,000 00
------.------------ 1,215,151 88
By a document transmitted to the
Senate, the Secretary acknow-
ledges a mistake in his estimate
of means of       -
2,264,452 28
619,136 47
All these deductions leave - $1,645,315 81
A further deduction ought to be made on ac-
count of anothsr error in setting down abou'
$500,000 of Treasuiy notes, which were redeemer
previous 10 March as a charge upon the remain-
ing ten months, which would leave the deficit little
more than a million But as this error has not
been acknowledged by the Secretary, and I wish to
proceed on his own daia, it is left out of the
amount
Hsre, then, on the Secretary >  own estimates of
exptndx'ures for tht j/ear, is the real amount ot this
formidable deficit But, rir, need there be any de-
fici' How is even this to be producen Why,
by swelling the estimates of exptnditures tor fie
year to an extravagant amount The appropna
¿tons for the year, as is demonstrated by the history
of the past, furnish ihe best guide for the expenii
Inns ot the year The appropi ations for this year
■were only from eighteen to nineteen millions of
dollars. But taking the sum of twenty millions,
which was the largest amount of expenditures for
the year of both new and old appropriations pro-
posed by the late Administration, the means for
the year are ample They are staled, up to the4th
of March by Mr Swing's report, At $5,199,885 10
For the remainder of the year at     20,083,592 72
Add the amount  of the acknow-
ledged error of the Seer taty
619,136 47
Meens of the year   -           - $25 902 614 29
A sum which no one can doubt would ha re
been fuily sufficient to m et the expenditures at the
ra'e of twenty millions for th  year, and redeem all
the Treasury notes felling due within the \ ear, and
leave a balance in the Treasury at its expiration
The sum proposed to be expended by the Secre'arv
cannot be expended without reducing the amount
of the outstanding appropriations at the end of ihe
ye«r greatly below their amount at its commence
ment All who undusiand the operations of the
Trea Lry Department can easily concewe lhat it
is possible to create a deficit at any given luiuie
day It is only neces^aiy, in ordtr to effect this,
to exhaust the Treasury by placing large sums in
the hands of the disbursing officers and agents of
he Govern meet
No one understands th s bettei than the present
Secretary of ffa', for he at a former time info
duced a resoluti n in this Hou e, and entered on
invest gations f< r ibe purpose of faxirg iuch a prae
tice on the late Administration The estimates for
expeud tures fí r the military establishment m the
report of the Sfcretary of the Treasury, must Inke
all as unnecessary large It is scarcely possible
that the amount can be prudently and properly ex
pended I hn ve siid, sir, that under an economical
administration of the Goveuiment, it is demonstra-
ble that the means of the year weie sufficient, and
that the'e was no necessity for thiscilled session to
supply any deficiency m the Treasu y Has not
this been, in effect, admitted hete? Why, sir, the
gentleman fron Kentucky, [Mr Underwood] on"
occasion of offering a resolimon at the beginning
of the session on the subject of a Bank, said he
wished to test the sense of the House, and if he
should ascertain that we could not pass a Bank, he
was ready imrrediately to adjourn and go borne.
It is not, then, to meet any exigencies of the Trea-
sury that this session has been called, however
convenient an excuse such alleged necessity might
iurmsh
But, sir, what is the rate of expenditure as pro-
posed for tre present y ear m ibe report of the Se
cretary, in older to mak« eut his deficit'1
The expenditures picviou  to   he 4 h of Match,
are set down at .           .              $4,627,166 44
Required of old appropriations to
complete the year                         24,210 000 00
We thus have the 'um, aside irom
the new appropriations asked at
this extra se sion, ot                    $28 837,166 44
Add these, amounting to    .           .   2,521,336 98
And we have the startling amount
ot                                               $31,358,503 42
The Secretary'^ estimate cf expenditures tor the
Ihiee m tnhs of June, July, and Auau t, is still
mor" excessive, being                    $11,151,693 37
Which, multipl ed ty                                           4
Gives,  as ihe rate for the year, the
very moderate sum of              . $44 606 773
But the chairman of tht Committee of Ways
and Means remarked that probably tee estimates
of expenditures by the Secretary are rot too high,
and that it was ft rtunate we had he m ans uf test-
ing his accuracy in the item of the expels s of tht,
extra st ssion "?re S'-retary, he  a d, had estima
ted them at only $350,000, whereas, wis have a -
ready arpropria ed jp394 000 1 sh >H be agreeably
disappointed if tVv do not exceei? ever uat surr
and run up to hall a million It thr  r to be a test
of the accuracy of the Secretary, me restnt cannot
be considered vay gratifying Nor do I conceive
that this too !o v esun ate m this rospect proves the
other estimates to be also too low for m palliation
of this departure from exictness, i rony be suggest-
ed as natural that, since his fr ends ar  responsible
for the extra session, the Secre aiy should wish, so
far as he could consistently with truth, to impress
the coui try with the idea that th"se expenses were
not to be ot great amount, while with regard to
those estimates which go to make out the necessity
for the call of Congress together, an opposite feel-
ing might be supposed to operate.
The gen leman from New York, made one com-
plaint against the late Administration as tending
to show the necessity of large expenditures, worthy
of notice— hat various works of internal improve-
ment had been neglected and discontinued, and
even the implements sold. This complaint comes
certainly not wi h a very good grace from those
who have talked so loudly about economy The
discontinuance of these works was one of the mea-
sures of retrenchment and economy of th« la*e
Administration, and was owing to the rejection by
its friends in Congress of appropriations for their
prosecution, on account of a general belief ef their
u constitutionality and inexpediency. When we
hear «uch complaints—when we remember the
mortal aversion whicn many gentlemen on the other
side entertain tov ards any thing like a strict con-
struction of the Constitution, and regard the inevi-
table tendency which an increased and extended
exercise of the powers of the General Government
must have to increase its expenditures—can any
thug el«e be expected "but an enormous enlarge-
ment of those expenditures, and wasteful appropri-
ations of ihe public money producing no corre
sponding benefit For it is a fací taught by experi-
ence, and resulting from the nature of things, that
works of this sort ate carried on disadvantageous-
ly and ruinously by the General Government, and
even in view of economy alone, are much more
safely left to State, corporate, or individual en-
térense.
Nor can I ?gree with the gentleman from New
Yoik in the opinion which he seems to intimate,
that the Government ou^ht not to be obliged to
come, from session to session, to Congress, and ask
for meant  in tbe shape of Treasury notes, as if it
weie derogatory to its dignity 10 be obliged to ask
this of the Representatives of the people. It is tbe
people who are mas ers of the Government, and
net the Government of the people The doctrine
that the Government ought to be provided profuse-
ly and largely with funds, is directly adver«e to
the practise of economy Nothing with individu-
al or Willi nations tends more to economy than
an income limited wilhin reasonable bound . A
redundant Treasury not only conduces to waste-
fulness and extravagance, as experience has too
well shown, but it is no proof of prosperity Prom
the people the money comes which increases tbe
funds of th  Treasury, and thus the richer the Go-
vernment, the poorer muJ be the people In time
of peace, I never wish to «ee a redundant revenue,
nor an oveiáowing Treasury The best place for
the money is the pockets of the people
Bat this bill ought not to be considered as stand-
ing by itself, isolated and alore, but be also viewed
in reference to surrounding circumstance  To re-
gard any measure aside fiom every thing with
which it is connected in its inception and itserlects, is
not th  part ot a statesman, but rather that of a
monk or hermit in his cell Considered tn con-
nectt n wito the act tj distribute the proceeds of
the public lands this bill is—to the amount of
those proceeds—a proposition to borrow money
for tne purpose of giving it away to the States, and
must result in a tax on the people for the purpose
of repay ment Ihe money is to be given, not to
the "eople frem wnose labor it must come, but to
t> e States, to be distributed to corporations or laid
out n works of internal improvement, of a partial,
local and cucumscnbed character, to raise the value
tf scrip m the handscfstcckjobbers and brokers,
o be loaned out to bankers ai d speculators. Prom
\ httice ihe money is lo be derived, no one can
doubt It is lo come from the consumers, by this
nrrce^s of tdxaUon by which the poor man who
crisunes as much in his family as his wealthy
netgibor, pays an equal tax, not a tax in propor-
tion to his comparative poverty, but equal in
amount As a necessary result ot these mea-
sures, there is already a bill before the Committee
of Ways and Means proposing a duty of 20 per
cent, ad valorem, not on luxuries merely, (for we
have heard a great deal here about taxing silks
and champagne) hut on the necessaries of life, such
as tea, coffee, sugar, molasses, the spices which are
in common use, and various other articles.   Yes,
