OCTOBER 7, 1863.

Every effort has been and, I doubt not, will be made to supply our gallant armies.

J. A. S.,

Secretary of War.

CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS HILL'S CORPS, September 29, 1863.

In future no man will be excused from any duty whatsoever on the ground of being barefooted. Officers extending the slightest indulgence to this class of men will be held to a strict accountability. Eighteen thousand pairs of shoes have been issued to this corps in the last two months, and still more are asked for. This fact points to abuses on the part of the soldiers and want of vigilance in company officers which must be corrected.

By command of Lieutenant-General Hill:

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Indorsements.]

Brigade commanders will state whether their barefooted men are all up. If not they must be sent for.

By command of Major-General Stewart:

R. A. HATCHER,
