OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., February 25, 1863.

Colonel CHRISTIAN THIELEMANN,

Sixteenth Regiment Illinois Cavalry.

COLONEL: In reply to your letter of the 19th instant asking that certain rebel prisoners of war at Camp Douglas and other camps be permitted to take the oath of allegiance and join your regiment I have to say that the Secretary of War forbids the enlistment into our ranks of prisoners of war who have been released on taking the oath of allegiance.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., February 25, 1863.

Major General JOHN E. WOOL,

Commanding Department of the East, New York.

GENERAL: I am directed by the Secretary of War to request that you will cause to be furnished to this office the names of all citizen prisoners on parole in your department, giving the authority for and the time of the arrest, the date and limits of parole and by whose order. This information is desired with a view to effect an exchange for prisoners held by the rebels at Richmond.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

NEW YORK, February 25, 1863.

Colonel W. HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

COLONEL: I have sent to Mr. Fox, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, a declaration of exchange of the men of the gun-boat Isaac Smith, detained at City Point on the 21st instant and who were sent hence to Annapolis. Will you please have him give the necessary order transferring to your order all the prisoners at Fort Lafayette held under the order of the Navy Department who were captured previously to December, 1862, that date covering all captures on the sea? Zarvona is also to be exchanged so I understood the Secretary of War. If I am correct in this he can be sent with the other prisoners. It would be well to parole all of them (before they leave their various places of detention) not to make any attempt at escape or hold any outside communication until delivered within the Confederate lines. I hear that there are a large number of prisoners of war at Fort Delaware.
