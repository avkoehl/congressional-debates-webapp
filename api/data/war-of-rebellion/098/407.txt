non's Bridge to re-enforce about daylight. General Stevenson commanded in person. The men while standing on the skirmish line for hours and while wading sometimes waist-deep in the swamp behaved with the same cheerfulness and alacrity which marks every operation in the corps. Twenty prisoners were taken. The division, with a loss of two wounded, forced the passage of the River, took a position strong by nature and defended by works, inflicting a loss of 6 killed, 14 wounded, and 26 prisoners. The mounted men of the Twentieth Illinois under Captain King, were of great service on the first day, and if horses could have been brought over they would have harassed the enemy's retreating columns on the second day.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, S. C., February 20, 1865.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that, on reaching camp on the evening of the 15th instant, Colonel Wiles, commanding Second Brigade, took out the Sixty-eighth Ohio to Taylor's Bridge, over Congaree Creek, waded through several hundred yards of water, crossed upon the only remaining stringer of the bridge, drove in the rebel pickets, and intrenched. My pioneers, and those of the Fourth Division, being sent out by order of the general commanding the corps, I sent the Twentieth Ohio out with them. In the night the bridge was rebuilt and a footing for infantry constructed, opening a route to flank the force in front of the Fifteenth Corps on Congaree Creek. This force, as I have since learned, withdrew at 1 a.m., and crossed the River to Columbia. The picket in front of Colonel Wiles withdrew an hour later.

I inclose a copy of a morning report of a brigade of General Butler's cavalry division, picket up in his camp yesterday (19th). The original is in pencil and soiled. An intelligent man of the Tenth Georgia is among the prisoners at corps headquarters.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. F. FORCE,

Brigadier-General.
