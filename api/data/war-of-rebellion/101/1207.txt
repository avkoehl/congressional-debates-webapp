Respectfully returned.

The source from which this information is received is a very unreliable one. It is a very good rule, and a very natural one, to act in direct opposition to the wishers or views of the enemy, and it is certainly to be recommended that additional stimulus be given to deserters from the rebel army instead of discouraging them from assisting to put down this rebellion or checking the piratical raids of the said Ratliff. If, however, the Burgess Scouts misbehave themselves, and it is do proved by loyal witnesses, the commanding officer at Plaquemine has authority and is ordered to send all delinquents to this city for discharge. These scouts took a formal oath before entering service to do no act in violation of the laws of war.

By command of Brigadier-General Sherman:

P. J. MALONEY,

First Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
