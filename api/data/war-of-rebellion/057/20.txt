eral McPherson for duty, McCook's division (First) was to move on Howard's left, and Kilpatrick's (Third) to operate with Palmer's corps from Ringgold.

Reliable information was received on the 30th from Atlanta (27th) that heavy re-enforcements to Johnston had been passing that point since the 20th, said to be from Mobile, estimated at 10,000. The same person reports from Rome (28th) that part of Polk'd corps was there, numbering about 5,000, and still more arriving. Two trains with artillery, fourteen pieces, had arrived that day. Martin's cavalry division was also there, about 4,000 men; also, part of Polk's corps had reached Dalton the same day (28th.)

A reliable scout, sent to Dalton from Chattanooga, reaching Dalton on the 25th, returned on the 30th, reporting that the whole of Hood's corps had been moved to the front from its old position in the immediate vicinity of Dalton. He went to Atlanta on the 27th, but learned nothing of importance there. At Resaca he saw the camps of Armstrong's division of cavalry, and at Rome he learned that Loring's and another division had arrived from Mississippi, thus corroborating information received from a different source.

During the month there have returned to this army from furlough, as veteran volunteers, eighteen regiments of infantry, one of cavalry, and four batteries of artillery, with an aggregate of 2,697 recruits gained while absent.

The quartermaster's department has been particularly active constructing store-houses, &amp;c. at Chattanooga. I have the honor to inclose herewith lists of steamers and other transportation employed by the quartermaster's department on the Upper Tennessee, and of the military store-houses at Chattanooga and Bridgeport; also the monthly report of the transactions of the provost-marshal's department.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
