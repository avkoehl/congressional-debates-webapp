Brigadier-General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

Colonel Kniffin has just handed me the following telegram addressed to him:

The state of your supplies makes it necessary no to issue more that half rations of sugar. Give order to that effect to the commissary of your corps.

S. SIMMONS,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Commissary of Subsistence.

As this appears to be a matter of importance, I desire to know if it has the sanction of the general commanding the department.

Colonel STARLING,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have just received a report from General Wagner that a body of rebel cavalry was at Altamont yesterday, but he could not learn the strength of it. I presume it was not large, and give the information with a view to sending some of our cavalry into that region to clear out the rebels, who are there doubtlessly to watch our movements.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THE. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
