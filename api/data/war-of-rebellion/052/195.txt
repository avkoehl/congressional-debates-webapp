HEADQUARTERS CHIEF OF CAVALRY,DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,

Stevenson, Ala., August 27, 1863.

Brigadier General GEORGE CROOK,

Commanding Second Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs me to say that he is informed to-day that during the time that Colonel Long's brigade has been encamped in this vicinity no steps have been taken to provide the horses with fodder, and that they have received as yet nothing but the ration of forage drawn from Stevenson, not having been even grazed, while within 3 miles of the camp there is from 200 to 300 acres of green corn standing along the vicinity of the river.

Major Patten reports that when he applied to Colonel Long's adjutant-general (Captain Crane) for permission to go out and bring in fodder for the animals, Captain Crane informed him that there was no authority for taking such stuff, but, on the contrary, there was an order against so doing. The general commanding desires to know by whose authority this order was given, as he is unaware of such an order ever having been issued, and if it does exist it should be immediately countermanded, as it would be almost like cutting our own throats to deprive our stock of the feed so necessary to their existence, and on the contrary, orders have been repeatedly issued from these headquarters, and even had no orders been issued the universal custom since the general has commanded the cavalry would warrant the commanders in providing to the utmost feed for their horses. At the same time instructions have been repeatedly issued from these and department headquarters defining manner in which such property should be taken and by whom, and it is difficult to comprehend how such an order could have reached Colonel Long or such an impression existed at the headquarters of his brigade.

The general desires this matter investigated, and in future every means taken at all times to provide for the proper feeding of the horses of the command.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CAMP AT CHITWOOD'S TENN., August 27, 1863.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Our advance reached here yesterday, and all the forces that came over the South Fork and the Marsh Creek roads will move up to-night except some of the supply trains and rear guard. General White's division is at Jamestown Cut. I have not yet heard of the forces that went by way of Livingston and Jackson; expect to hear every moment. Men in good spirits. Forage short. Just received Secretary's dispatch about Fort Sumter. We are jubilant. Shall push on as fast as possible. We have had terrible roads.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
