HANOVER JUNCTION, July 2, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON:

This place is so threatened that I do not think it safe to leave tonight. Enemy reported near Dabney's also.

E. D. HALL,

Colonel, Commanding.

BOTTOM'S BRIDGE, July 2, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

I have just sent an order for Baker to move up from Old Church to colonel Hall at Morris' Bridge. Hall needs artillery, which should be sent from the river lines. These could be replaced, if necessary, by Coit's and Wright's batteries on the Williamsburg road. [T. C.] Singeltary ought also to be sent to Hall.

Respectfully,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.

JULY 2, 1863.

General ELZEY:

GENERAL: I am going down this morning to feel the Yankees. I hope that you will send out Custis Lee's command to hold the Charles City Central and New Market roads at the works during our absence.

I would be glad also for you to relieve Cooke's pickets at New Bridge and the Federal Bridge (destroyed).

Should there be any serious movement upon Petersburg during my absence, send Wise's command over, and relieve him by Custis Lee. I cannot return till to-morrow night, if then.

Very respectfully,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.

BOTTOM'S BRIDGE, July 2, 1863-3 p. m.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON:

Colonel Hall would not telegraph a vague rumor. I think that General Custis Lee's force ought to support him. Courier just from Long Bridge reports that there is no movement in that direction. General Lee will not then be needed on the left of General Wise, but might be of infinite use at Hanover Junction. Corse, Lee, and Hall concentrated then, could beat the Yankees so thoroughly as to prevent a raid upon Gordonsville.

Respectfully,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.
