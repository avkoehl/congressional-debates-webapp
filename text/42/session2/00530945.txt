Indiana's claim on two pkr cknt. fund.
Mr. WILSON, of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, on
the 22d of January last the following memorial
of the Governors of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois
was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:
State op Illinois. Executive Department,
springfikld, Junuat y 4,
Senator* and Representatives in Congress:
Wo respectfully request your favorable considera-
tion of the claims of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to
two fifths of the five per cent, received into the
national Treasury from the proceeds of the public
lands sold in said States respectively, being a part
of the five per cent, granted to them in their en-
abling acts, and for all of which the States rendered
a large equivalent in refraining from taxing said
lands for five years after they were disposed 01 to
individuals. In making this request we cannot
doubt it will receive, as it deserves, your approval.
Certainly no good reason can be assigned why the
claims should not be allowed and paid by the Gov-
ernment of the United States to these States. To
withhold payment wouldbe to discriminate unjustly
againstourown States, and this, we earnestly msi&t,
would be a great wrong. We do not propose, how-
ever, to reargue the question, for that would be a
work of supererogation. Let it suffice to say that
we hold it to be a legal axiom that tho act of March
3,1857, entitled "An act to settle certain accounts
between the United States and the State of Missis-
sippi and other States/' commands the statement,
allowance* and payment of what has not been paid
of these accounts, without abatement or discount,
and we ask you shall declare that to bo the truo
construction of said act, to the ond that it may be
respected and executed. It is difficult to understand
how any doubts should ever have been expressed as
to the correct meaning of the legislation, and to you
we appeal, in behalf of our respective States, for
that justice to whiuh they are clearly entitled.
Believing you will promptly render it, and thus
place the States in which public lands were located
on an approximate equality at least, and respect the
obligations of the United States to the States of Ohio,
Indiana, and Illinois, we subscribe ourselves, yours,
most respectfully,
JOIIK M. PALMER,.
(rooernor of Illinois.

Governor of Indiana 
11. B. HAYES,
Governor of Ohio,
And on the same day a joint resolution was
referred to the same committee, which is now-
brought to the attention of the House, the
intention of which is to declare the true con-
struction of the act approved March 3, 1857,
referred to in this memorial. It is as follows:
Joint resolution declaring the true construction of a
statute.
Be it resolved hy the Senate and House of Repre-
sentative# of the United States of America in CongresH
assembled, That the true intent and meaning of the
second section of the act approved March S, 1857.
entitled "An act to settle certain accounts between
tho United States and the State of Mississippi and
other States," is that all the other States, to wit.
Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, which have not received
the full amount of their five per cent, of the net
proceeds of the sale of public lands lying within
their respective limits, as mentioned in their several
enabling acts, in money, shall have their account**
stated, both on the public lands and reservations,
and such cash balance as has not been paid to said
States allowed and paid.
Before reading the act to be construed by
this resolution, the attention of the House in
asked to certain legislative acts out of which
the claims in question and others of precisely
similar character arose.
On the 80th of April, 1802, (2 Statutes-at-
Large, p. 173; 2 Brightley's Digest, p. 707,)
Congress passed the act for the admission
of Ohio into the Union. The portion of tha^
act material to the matter under consider-
ation is as follows:
"3. That the following propositions be, and the
same aro oftered to the convention of the eastern
State of said Territory, when formed, for their free
I acceptance or rejection, which, if accepted by the
convention, shall be obligatory upon the United
States:" A * * * *
"Third, That one twentieth part of the net pro-
ceeds of the lands lying within the said State sold by
Congress from and after the 30th day of June next,
after deducting all expenses incident to the same,
shall be applied to the laying out and making public
roads leading from the navigable waters emptying
into tho Atlantic, to the Ohio, to the said State, and
through the same, such roads to be laid out under
the authority of Congress, with the consent of tho
several States through which the road shall pass:
Provided That the three foregoing propo-
sitions herein offered are on the condition that the
convention of the said State shall provide, by an
ordinance, irrevocable without the consent of the
United States, that every and each tract ot land sold
by Congress, from and after the 30th day of June next,
shall be ana remain exempt from any tax laid by
order or under authority of the State, whether by
State, county, or township, or any other purpose
whatever, for the term of live years from and after
the day of sale."
By the second section of the act of March 3.
1803, provision was made for paying three per
cent, of the proceeds of these lands to the
State of Ohio, to be applied exclusively in the
construction, &c., of roads within the Slate.
(See 2 Statutes, |>. 220.)
On the 19th of April, 1816, (see 3 Statutes,
j p,289 ; 1 Brightley's Digest?l>. 41JJ,) the act was
! passed to enable Indiana to become a State,
i! The provisions of that act material totheques-
:! tion being considered are as follows ;
'j " 3. That the following propositions be, and tho
I same are hereby, offered to the convention ot the
i *aid Territory of Indiana, when formed, for their
