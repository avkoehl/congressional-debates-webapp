Hampton's division is at Rowanty Creek, picketing from the infantry's right to Stony Creek, and at Stony Creek there is a division of infantry. This information comes from citizens and negroes. I drove in their pickets and advanced until driven in return. The enemy followed to within one mile of our pickets at Lee's Mill. There were no casualties on my side.

Very respectfully,
