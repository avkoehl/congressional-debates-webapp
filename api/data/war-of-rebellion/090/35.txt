CEDAR CREEK, VA., October 27, 1864 - 12 midnight.

(Received 10 a. m. 29th.)

I made a demonstration up the Luray Valley yesterday with a portion of Powell's division of cavalry, and to-day made a reconnaissance up the Strasburg valley as far as Woodstock and beyond. Powell met opposition from some of Lomax's cavalry at the gorge near Milford, in the Luray Valley. In the main valley nothing was found. The enemy's infantry was reported by deserters to be between New Market and Harrisonburg, with Rosser at Mount Jackson. These, with other demonstrations which I will make, will secure Augur against all but Mosby and the numerous robbers that now infest the country, and which one good regiment could clear out any time, if the regimental commander had spunk enough to try. There is a regiment of cavalry at Harper's Ferry, one at Martinsburg, and one at Winchester, which is sufficient mounted force to keep the lower Valley clear, but they do not do it. Brigadier-General Duffie was captured between Winchester and Martinsburg. I respectfully request his dismissal from the service. I think him a trifling man and a poor soldier. He was captured by his own stupidity.

WINCHESTER, VA., November 1, 1864 - 10 a. m.

(Received 9 p. m.)

I have nothing new to report. I have made cavalry demonstrations up the Luray Valley and up the main valley to prevent any concentration on Augur in taking up the road. Nothing new was developed. Found some rebel cavalry at Milford, in Luray Valley, and nothing north of Mount Jackson, in the main valley. There cannot be anything but Mosby's forces to annoy Augur.

NEWTOWN, November 10, 1864 - 9 a. m.

I have started a brigade of infantry this morning form Winchester to protect the railroad working parties. I sent a brigade of cavalry there some days since. I have had a small division of cavalry operating on the east side of the mountains in the vicinity of Uperville, Paris, Bloomfield, and surrounding country. No enemy found there, nor had anything been in that section excepting Mosby's command. A lot of stock, horses, sheep, and cattle were brought in by this force, and the grain, barns, subsistence, &amp;c., so far as practicable, were destroyed, Any reports that you amy have heard or received within the last few days of large radioing parties of the enemy, and of a concentration of Mosby near Berryville, are untrue.
