HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, Camp Winfield Scott, April 16, 1862-1.30 a.m.

Brigadier General E. V. SUMNER,Commanding Second Cavalry Corps:

General Smith has been directed to drive the enemy from the works they are erecting in the vicinity of the one-gun battery.

Please direct General Gorman to watch carefully Smith's right flank, and to prevent the enemy from crossing the stream to attack him in flank. It may be well for Gorman to creat a diversion by shelling the fort at Union Mill, taking care that his artillery is well supported by infantry.

General Smith will move early in the morning; consequently General Gorman should be informed on the movement as early as possible.

By order of General McClellan:

A. V. COLBURN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Brigadier General E. V. SUMNER,

Commanding Second Corps:

General McClellan directs that you open fire with as many guns as you can possibly bring to bear on the forts in front of Gorman's, to create a diversion from this point.

You will probably hear a heavy firing at this point, but keep up your fire at the point indicated as long as there is anything in sight and until further orders, whether anything is seen or not.

A. V. COLBURN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
