Bvt. Major General B. F. KELLEY,

Commanding Second Infantry Division, Dept. of West Virginia:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs that in sending scouting parties into the enemy's country they be instructed to arrest such persons from among the prominent citizens as it would be proper to hold as hostages for Union citizens now held in confinement by the rebel Government. These persons will be arrested as far outside our lines as possible, and care will be taken to arrest only such persons as are influential enough to demand consideration at the hands of the Confederate Government.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBT. P. KENNEDY,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
