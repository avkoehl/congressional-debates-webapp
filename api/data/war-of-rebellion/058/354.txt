Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

The change of railroad manager has added 60 per cent, to the freight carried. This, I hope, will enable me soon to supply an army in East Tennessee sufficient to drive Longstreet out. The road will be complete to Loudon to-morrow, and to Stevenson via Decatur by Monday next.

Brigadier General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General, Washington, D. C.:

The wagons and mules called for by General Thomas are more than can be required by the four departments in my command in addition to what they have. If furnished we could not supply them nor move with such a train. I will make an order regulating transportation in a few days.
