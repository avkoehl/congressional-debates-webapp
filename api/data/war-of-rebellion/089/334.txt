Major H, also asks for two 8-inch howitzers for Fort Sedgwick, vice a field battery (less than I have recommended for that work), but which cannot be spared. Can you given him them with the necessary amount of ammunition? If you do, will you be able to furnish men to serve them?

HENRY J. HUNT,

Brigadier-General.

BROADWAY LANDING, VA., October 24, 1864.

Brigadier-General HUNT, Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

If it be necessary to put a section of 4 1/2-inch guns in Fort Davis I would suggest to put one of Pratt's there, and the other with two mortars for ditch service in Fort Sedgwick instead of the siege howitzers. It would be very hard to serve the latter there, because mantlets could hardly be used from their extreme shortness. By the above arrange ment no extra men would be necessary. The plan of putting heavy guns in these batteries will entail great difficulty of supplying ammunition, but if necessary it can, of course, be done.

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery.

BROADWAY LANDING, VA., October 24, 1864.

Brigadier-General HUNT, Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

I have seen General Benham. He has no heavy artillery soldiers. I have none not in use. Please, therefore, assign two good companies to my command to serve the ten guns. I would like some of the Fourth New York if they can be had.

BROADWAY LANDING, VA., October 24, 1864.

Lieutenant MICHIE,

Chief Engineer, Headquarters Army of the James:

You will greatly oblige me if you will request General Butler to allow me to move the mortars from Dutch Gap to Fort Brady, where they will be more efficient by far, and the light guns to this landing, where a new fort is to be put up. They do no service at the gap which a section of light artillery could not better perform.
