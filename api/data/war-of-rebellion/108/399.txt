McDOWELL, VA., November 29, 1861.

Colonel S. M. BARTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have just received your communication by express, dated yesterday. I have informed you that I was halted here by order of General Loring, but as I regard the order of the Adjutant-General as imperative I shall move on to Ryan's, and have expressed the telegram to General Loring, so that if he thinks it proper he may countermand the order. I have made all arrangements necessary for subsistence and forage up to the evening of the 3rd proximo. I can only reach Shaw's Fork to-night. Will reach Ryan's to-morrow by 3 o'clock, and advise you by express of my movements.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. B. TALIAFERRO,

Colonel, commanding Troops en route for Manassas.

CAMP AT McDOWELL,

November 29, 1861-9 a. M.

Lieutenant Colonel C. L. STEVENSON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I am just in receipt of the inclosed telegram from Adjutant-General Cooper, addressed directly to me.* You will perceive the order is imperative to march from my present position, and is dated the 28th instant. I feel greatly embarrassed, but shall move my command on to Ryan's, at which point Colonel Barton writes me from Staunton to halt a few hours. It is impossible to reach Ryan's to-day, owing to the condition of the roads, and may not reach there before the evening of the 30th. I send this by special express, and any order of the general commanding can overtake me at Ryan's to-morrow night. Under the impression that the command was to march through Staunton to save transportation, I have not permitted the issue of all the tents which would be required by the troops. I will therefore have to send to Staunton forthem, as well as for some ammunition.

WM. B. TALIAFERRO,

Colonel, &amp;c.
