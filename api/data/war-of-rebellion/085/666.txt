JEFFERSON CITY, October 6, 1864- 11 a. m.

Colonel JOHN V. DU BOIS,

Chief of Staff, Saint Louis, Mo.:

We yet hold the Moreau, on the Bolton and Shipley Ferry roads. The enemy, with a battery of five guns, are gradually pressing our forces on the Bolton road. They are expending a good deal of artillery ammunition this morning. No casualties reported. The enemy's main force camped on both sides the Osage last night at Bolton's. I have scouts well out in the direction of Tuscumbia, watching every movement that may be made toward Boonville. We are growing stronger in our defenses every hour. The commands are int he best of condition and spirits.

Brigadier-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 6, 1864- 11 a. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

McNeil and Sanborn have joined me. The enemy are steadily advancing to the Osage. We shall vigorously contest the passage of the Osage and the Moreau with cavalry and mountain howitzers,a nd fight over every inch of the ground. The increasing hordes of guerrillas in North Missouri prevent re- enforcements from prompt response int hat direction. We have no information of you movements upon the enemy's rear. If possible, please advise me what aid we may expect from your pursuing force.

Colonel J. V. DU BOIS,

Chief of Staff, Saint Louis, Mo.:

Several dispatches giving the general commanding our situation have been sent to headquarters by different routes within the last day or two. T	hey have not reached you. The rebels burned the Osage railway bridge and buildings yesterday morning. McNeil and Sanborn,with 2,500 men and eight pieces of artillery, have joined us. They report the enemy in strong force approaching the Osage from Linn. Our scouts report their advance at several fords on the Osage. A body of rebels, 1,000 strong, occupied Westphalia at 8 o'clock this morning. We shall contest the passage of the Osage and Moreau, and fight over every inch of the ground back to our trenches. The utmost economy in the use of ammunition will be exercised. We are entirely without information as to movements upon the enemy's rear by forces from below.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
