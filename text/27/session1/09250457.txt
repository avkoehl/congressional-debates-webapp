tween theStates ceding ana the Tederal alliance, and there
foie come within the express provisions of tho sixih article of
the Constitution which declares that 'All deots contrae ed
and engagements entered mto before the adoption of this Const!
tution,shall be as valid against the United states und> r this
Constitution as im^tr t!ie Confedeiation " It is, theieforp
Submitted, that neither the relation of ihe parties nor (he obii
fationof the agreements was chained by the adoption ol the
'ederal Constitution, but tlu y were expies^ly recogm ed and
maintained by thit instrument That such was the under
standing oí the States interested in ttese waste lands is very
evident from the teims of the deed of cession of North Caio
lina, as welt as that of Georgia, the lattei of whuh bears
date tn 1802 the Fedttal Constitution having been adopted m
1787 That deed is in no wise different fiom the othei deed--,
and goes mostconclusively to sustain the conduction which
has been submitted as the true one to be putupon these deeds
A si jgle quota ion fiom it will be sufficient to establish this po
eition "Toe grants recognised by the pieceding conditions
shall b° considered as a common fund foi the use and btnefit
of the United States Geoigia included "
Here again it was deemed necessaty to include the ceding
State If, as. it hats been, and again may be contended the tes
eion was absolute and unconditional to the United fetales, why
was it nece^ary to include lieoigia, the ceding Stale, by name,
m terms? Wabshe not one of the United States, and would she
not have taken under thegeneiai pranli The ¡state of Geoigia,
however, giving the some construction to these deeds of cession
for which £ contend, hought herself withm then piovibion^by
including herself m hei own deed by nunc intPtms If the
construction gi\ en to these deeds of cession and the aiticlet  of
the Constitution to which! have refeuetl be the true one, it foi
lous that the Federal Government stand*, precisely m the same
relat'on to the States under the Constitution that she did under
the Aruclesof Confederation so far as the ceded lands are con
cerned, and that *ht i  bound in good faith to cairy into efket
the usps and purposes of that trust upon tne demand ol the
bates natert&ted I base this pan of the aigu merit upon the ob-
jects of ihe cession, the terms o** the deeds of ces&ion, and the
j rovisi m of the C institution thatreco^ uses and maintain  it em,
without resorting to anothet clause m the Constitution that will
be cite 1 to sustain another pan ol the argument, but which al:>o
bearestrongiyupon this
Itwilibe&aid that these deeds of cession embiace but a por
tion ol the lands covered by the ptopo¡>ition to distribute the
proceeds of the sales and hat the other lands do not stand u po i
tht «ame footing
It has also bten ursied that nodistnbution can take place un
til aftei the public lands have paid into the National Tieat-uiv
then cost including all the expenses of their a Immigration
These positions will be buefiy examined in then older
I is. vet y ttue that a portion of the public lands are not em
biaued by tht deeds of cession, but have been purchased with
tl e common funds of ihe ppople of the Sta es an I tl eretote
may be considered as the common propeity of all, and subject
to the opera ion of the t hird secuon of the tout th article of the
Cons uiuion, which declares that "The Congress shall have
power to dispose of, and make all needful rules and ugulaiiom 
respecting the temtory or other piopeity belonging to the
United ¡states " This power 13 lull, ample and complete ovei
the propeity and its disposition The question then arises are
the public lands which aienotincluded within the teims of the
deed* of cession to be considered "territory or other property
belonging to the United States " Is there any doubt mthe mat
ter1 Then what is the power of Congress over this "temtory?'
The constitutional answer is, to " dispose of it,' to make all
needful rules and regulations respecting it " It is in the full
anJ unquestioned exercise of this power that the compacts wi h
the States on their admission were made, that all the gtants
have been made to thebofdieis of the last war, to States, to
com pames, to colleges tn individuals, foi school pui poses, and
to the various other objects that Congress has, from time to
tune lecognised as entitled to its favor Without this power, it
is submitted whether those compact*, and all those grants, are
not without wariant m the Constitution It is fut thei submitted
that the constiuction thus given by all the depaitments of the
Government, fiom its foundation, to this exeicise of constitu
tunal power over the public domain, by Congiess should
lut, at this day, he questioned lak ng this construction,

mshesthe answer, that is, that as these lands weie puithased
by the common treasure, drawn from the whole people,
no account can pos-ibly arise between them and the pro
pej ty they now ask to be sold and returned to them in
the form of a distribution If they have paid mere for the
whole than they have received fiom thesale of a part, is thit
aa argument against disposing of the balance, and leturnmg
to them the amount they have paid over and above the sum
they have reaetted?    Those who oppose the ¡premises will,
of coii)f5f> deny the conclusion If the pi emires are correct,
the conclusion follows, as the constitutional question coveis
the whole giound, so far as these lands aio concerned It
may be said, howevei, that the cedf d landf , admitting them to
be in tiust,are subjected 10 a hkt d ffiulty, that ¡he quan ity
sold of thtbe lands ha* n>t jet pud tht ro-*t or p\|fiisp^at

tion ha-a been mainfamt.d with great confidence, b H it seems to
me tha' a due coifekleiation of the question md the relation of
the paitas wiilga fai to íemove this objection admitting the
truth of the position, that there would be a balance against
them at this time uponastuct accounting which is fir from
being the case, as I will conclusively t>how The Statts aro

Balance in favor of lands       45,893,282
In 1832, as per Mr King's report, the balance in favor of the
public lauds was thtabove sum of é45,803,282 Since the date
of that repoit, or rather the period to which the calculation
was made, the amount received from the sales of the public
lands has been ovei 875 000,000 Hence it may safely be as-
sumed that thft balance in favor ofthe public lands, upon
the ¡tunciples laid down m theiepoitof Mr King,and. sus-
tained by the at tide or statement m the Intelligencer, la over
one humht«4 millions of dollata Ab it may be that some St*

I will not push the aigument further Having thrown out
these view , 1 will close this part of my remarks by saying that
I maintain the position that the pimeedsol the public lands
covered by the deeliof ceosion as well as of those not included
in the regions may be distnbuted among the States m just and
equitible propirtioni and should be w> distributed upon thede*
-nandnf a majoiity of the Sutes md the people interested,
thiough then Representatives here
Has Congiess bullicient evidence of that demand? Can tin*
he ihtel! 1-not them asme called for in a voice not to bs
u ihecded 01 misunderstood f 1 he memonals from btate Legis-
Idiuies which arebefoieus, piaying the distribution—public
opinion manifestedlo ho íecent elections and m other way*
in its favor—are-coticlusiveof the question,and leave asmgls
duty to perform—that of executing the will 01 our common con-
stituents if these opinion -ue correct, it would seem unneces-
sary o Ioo,v so c'oí-e y is it otherwise might be, into the effect
t  he pioducetl upon the St ties and people embarrassed as most
of them aie at thit, turn by the dutubution The Piesidenuin
11  message has, touched tht point and it may be added, that
at no lime's nee the e\tirguit hment ofthe pub'icdebt has the
distribution been su loudly called foi, as a measuie of relief to
the ri at  and people
Aeain It it, contended that the amount ofthe pioceedE ofthe
pjbhc 1 uids being abbtracttd ''lorn tht ie venue, will make it ne
ccssaiy to btmp v that amount by a new levy of imposts This
position may ht admitte 1, and the answer id, thata bill 19 before
the Senate to place the re\enut on a } eimanentba-us, eo far as
it can be done at pre&tnt, by bunging up duties to 20 por cent.
advaloiem It is not to be concealed, however, that there are
many who contend that the pi oceeds of the sales of the public
lands should form a component part of the peimanent revenue
of the nation in the public Tieasury—so i on g, at least, as tha
itvenue derived fiom impost* shall be as it is now presumed
tobe inadequate to ihe demands ouheTieasui y
It has long, howevei, been a desideratum with our ablest
¡I financier*, and especially with those immediately connected
