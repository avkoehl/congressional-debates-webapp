Keep the rebels busy bearing your messages, and hold them responsible with their lives first and property afterward for prompt and faithful performance of duty.*

General FISK:

No word from General Douglass. We have word that the bushwhackers are aiming to concentrate int he northeastern part of Callaway. Will send a force of cavalry in that direction to-night from Wellsville and Fulton. Will telegraph you result.

Major F. D. EVANS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Mexico:

I learn that a serious disaster occurred to the Third Cavalry Missouri State Militia, eight miles north of Rocheport, yesterday morning, by which their commissary and quartermaster train and thirty prisoners were lost. It appears that Colonel Matthews did not move his command in a body as ordered. When did General Douglass leave Mexico, and when would he be in the neighborhood of Rocheport?
