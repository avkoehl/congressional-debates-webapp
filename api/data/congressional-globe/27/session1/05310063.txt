Report of the Secretary of the Treasury—Mr. Calhoun.
Senate.
Union is no way responsible, either in  justice,
equity, or honor'    Would it relieve them to lay a
permanent mortgage,  virtually,  on the whole of
the public domain, m favsr of stockjobbers ard
speculators   You, gentlemen, (addie^smg the op
ptsue side) promised relief and reform to the peo-
pe    On thu  promise  they  haie  rased jou  lo
power    Is this the lsfoim, this the relief jou pro-
mised?    Will yon, cm you, rise in jour places
h re, and in derision,  tell ihe deluded"people that
when you promised reform and rel cf, you meart
debt, Ui i mo'tgsges, and the giving away of th=ir
inh°nt'rcc'i You aie stent, and wi1! befallen , jou
dare not make such an avo«-n!, ai d yet the¡>e are
the only measures you propose
But fit te not relief to Uupeeplc, to wftomcan it be?
To whom but hose who aiethetax consumers, and
no thetax pa)er*—who, m reality, support not the
Government, but are supported by the Government
Who but the mercenary porp —no, I shall not uie
so 'trong a teim—he dependent corps, who live,
orexpect to Uve, on the  Govetnment—the office
holders and expectants, of whom 'o fearful a 'light
ht on this D sti ct   n the 4ih of March last?   To
tits numere ui  body of not le^s than a hundred
thousand actual deperd^nts  on  Government, and
mor" han twice thai number of expecfnt , these
measures would indeed be rel ef    The moie that
is txt ac ed fiom the people by taxes, and by what-
ever other device tt can be effected,  the more goes
 o them     Their nterests and that of the people are
in direct confl c      That which  oppresses the one
pampers the other, that which takes from  the one
is gained to the other
But the^e aie not the only classes to whom these
measures would bring relief The e are other and
mr re powerful, who Aie looking on with ¡he most
intense aniifty, in the h"pe of g rgmg the'-a^elvis
l/itpirne is at'he exp=rso of the people These
look to drht , n<ík , baúl s, di tnbii r, ard
tdXes, as ihe cnoicts' of b'e sings Tie praui
tic debt, the more abundantly the s'ock market is
supplied, the more powerful and conlroihng the
Bank, the greater the amount of the public reve-
nue thai is dtstnbu'ed, and the heavier the taxe",
the better for them.
To all these, the measures so earnes'ly recom-
mended in this report would bring great and sub-
stantial relief. They are m deep distress—hungry,
f mished, and howling for toeir prey. Well they
t"ay b  Tne sys em of measures by means of
which they st long ltd on the vitals of the p^ple,
1 as been utterly overthrown, and has left them in
their piesent distressed and starved ct ndition The
object now is to renew ¡hat system Yes, sir, the
very measures recommended by the S cretary, are
the identical measures which divided the two great
part e>, the Republican and Federal, at the com
me )C->meat o> th  Governm-m, an 1 which, af er
more t an a half centutj of persevenig a d un-
yieidngie i unce, die fo ^er h?s >uo ceded in
overthro íiug. Wil any one, can any one, venture
to deny whAt I a^ ect1 V% 1 o is there so ignorant < f
oui political his ory, as not to know that ihe first
mraaurecn which tire great parties divided was ihe
funded deb , the next ihe National Bank, and
th= partnership through it of the Government with
the bank , «md tiwn the protective tariff, u ith nV the
uncons i uttonal and wasteful expenditures which

.elve¡> O be so, now found, making battle on
the opposite bide, to restore the measures, which
they have done to much to overthrow' How
wonderful the delusion'   Time, it is to be hoped,
may expe> t,   and   resu re  them  to    their true
p hition
If this attempt to revise the now  prostrate sys-
tem of federalism saould suceed, and it should be
once fcrmlv   reinstated,  with all i «s exaggerated
feature ,1 shall not say that it wiuld l?y the foun-
dation of a revolution in the Governmui , no, that
would be too weak, it would, of itself, be a revolu-
tion     The seat of Government and  power would
change and pass from the people lato  the hards of
one of the most corrupt and exacting moneyed e ligar-
chies,   of  which Hs'oiy hasl ft any r eord    The
immortal framers of ou' Co sti'u ion intended to
place the Government in the hands of th" people
—to  establish  a   Federal  Republic—a   constitu
tonal   Democracy     in   which   the  Government
should bs controlled by the  people, and be   admt
nistered for their good,  and not for the profit and
advantage of those in power and tneir dependants
and partisan*    Adopt  these measures, and ihis
would be revesed, th< power would depm fiom
the peop'e—from the tax pij ns peop'e—the ho-
nest and industrie us,  who -upport  th    Govern-
ment, without li nkirg for favo s, ar>d would pass
into the hand-* ot the master spmt*, who would, for
the time, control the Government by their lerds of
dependents and partisan , timed with the powerful
combinatn n of  ínteres s w 11 h ti ese measures are
intended lo atóente with 'nem      They  would
b"   too   strong   f< r   the   pe-op e      Yes,  I   pro-
claim it, pass  these   measure , let   th s   system
of   universal    plunder   be   once    firmly    fixed
oa the country, and   the   Government  will   be
revolutionized
Pause and reflect on thi> portentous concentra-
tion of power. Behold the numeroU) ind powi r-

dri 1 ISTme are to be ltcruited but ihose of tried
fidelity, and none retained whose ?eal is question-
able. Cast yoar ejes next on the interest proposed
to be associated with this corps, a formidable cen-
tral Bank, through which h most foul and cor
rupt and dtngerous of parti erships is to bare
storod wi'h the banking ivs'em, with its countle<s
host of officer , stockholders, and dependants
Then turn to ihe scheme of distribution, intended
to enlirt pntire States, and draw m'o this vortex
the dominant influence for th" lime of the Legisla-
tures of every S ate tn th* Union, and thus com-
bine both Genenlanil Sta e Governments m favor of
high taxes, wasteful expenditures, drb s ¿nd stocks,
aBd in support of profligate kaders, who e la'ent.
and influence may be neces ary to uphold this
scheme of plunder. Now, when we r fleet
that just m Ihe same pr< portion that these
measures rublract from the meats of the peop'e,
m he same propirtiou must their vo ce be made

We ate in the midst of a most powe-ful strng-
g'e If our Government is ever destined to fall it
must fdllbj m< asures such a^ are recommerd d in
this report It c a by no other. Ot all mcfMiic-,,
those connected witn the fiscal actioi of the
Government and the paper sjstem, (I isclud 
banks, pcper currcicy, anda funded debt,) requne
to be watched with tne greatest jealousy by a'l peo-
ple desirous of preserving their freedom They
are the passes through which revolution secretly
enters, and eorsummates ihe overthrow of hbsrty,
before the danger is perceived. If the voice of one
could be heard, who has never raissd it but in be-
half of the people, I would say to th/m, wach
with ceaseless vigilance these d&ngerou* p sses,
and, especially, the fiscal action of the Govern-
ment There emphatically lies ihe daBger which
has overthrown so many tree States, and is des-
tined to overthrow our\ ünle-s promptly met The
foundation of our system is equally—equal
burthens and equal benefits to all, but it ought to
be known—it is a truth with which all ought to be
deeplv impressed, t'ial (he fi cal action ¿J the Gfo-
vernmenl can by no ingenuity or em'f ivance be made
equal, and thai its unequal attlon of itstlf, tmthout
other cause, must, in, the end, destroy liberty, if not
checked and modelated To check ard moderate it
ii all that can be done. The right understanding
of this momentous truth is indispensable to 'the
preservation of our free andhappy institutions. I
pause for  a moment to explain
The fi-scal aetinn ef the Government consists of
two blanches, taxation  and expenditures, or, m
others words, revenue and di basements      Taxa-
tion,  disco meeted  from   expenditure and  consi-
dered  by  useK, may be made substantially equal,
though, even that, in so large a country  as ours,
and so differen' in its pursuits and production, is
no easy  matter, but, if  they be taken  together,
and be regarded in their joint effects as part of one
ptoce*s, as  they really   are,  it is ímpissib'e  to
make that process equal, unless, indeei, what taay
be taken fiom each individual by taxes, should be
returned to him by disbursements, wh ch would be
ab<urd.   It follows from this simple fact, that one
portion of the community mast necessarily put
into the Treasury, in  the form of taxes, more
than tbry receive back in that of disburs menls,
and-anoiber por ion receive back m di bursements
more thaa  they paid in  taxes    To one poilion,
t1   u, taxes ,r- in realty taxes, wine  to  another
they ?ic,   n Huh biuntie .    Toe moi et Co lected
n i?x s is not 1 st,  but  tía i ftrred     Wlat laxes
te\t iiorn e it is pa sed by  disbur«emen s to ano-
ther,   and to him to  whom more is returned  in
disbursements than what he paid in taxes, the dif-
ference is, as has been said, a bounty.    Hence
the inherent inequality of the fiscal action of ihe
Government, and which, of itself, without other
cause,  must create  two great conflicting parties,
the one m fat or of taxes and the other opposed.
The hi ber the taxes the more profuse and waste-
ful the expenditures—tne greater the gain to the
ene  and  ihe liss  to the other    Hence the con-
flict, which ex'ends not onlv to taxes and expendi-
tures, but  to  all connected measure —the count-
less wjys by which   ihe proceeds of industry majr
be taken by Iw from one and transferred to ano-
ther    It matters not what may be the form of the
Government    It originates m the nature of the
fiscal action, and is as true under populai Govern-
ments as other-.—under the Government of the
ma iy as that of the fi w or oí one    It is ihe great
elis urhing p u   —the pnmordeal disease   oí all
Governments—'hat colltct taxes anl   make dis-
bursement    It may b* m dera ed m ns action
b   wive constitutional prov sums, tut cm never be
actually overcome
Ih order to be more clearly understood, I will
íllsefa e what I h/ive stat d in general terms, by
ti Acmg its operations in detail in a suppositious
cas  Foi th s purpose I sha 1 selict ihe two
adjacent counti s, lying on the oloer side of the
Potomac—Fairfax, which is opposite to the Dis-
net, anl Loudon, «hove Suppose, then, they
formed alite Repub ic goven  d by the will of a
maj rity, suppose that ihey were equally wealthy,
and that the income, annually, ot ihe r citizeus,
was ¿300 000 each Suppose, again, the ma-
jority lo be -o just as to lmpo^e an equal tax on
e^ch, s„y $100 000, making Ihe annual receipts of
the Tieasnry to be $200 000, and mat Loudon,
cvamng itself of its grtatei numbers, should appro-
priate the whole to herself, in the improvemeiMS ot
her roadf and rivers, in granting pensions to her
ctt Z'ns, and the various other modes in wh ch the
pub ic money may be spent. Is it not e'ear that
her income would be increased, and that of Fairfax
diminished, notwithstanding the equality of the
taxes The former would not enly receive back in
the shape of expenditures, what she had paid in thai
of taxes, but all that had been paid by the lattwr
