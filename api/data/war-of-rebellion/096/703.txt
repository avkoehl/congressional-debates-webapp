Orders as many of the Eighteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry as are equipped to report at these headquarters at once. The regiment must be here to-morrow morning early. Use every exertion to mount more of the regiment if possible. Dismount men in camp, if you can, to furnish the regiment with more. It is important the regiment should be here at once.

Brigadier-General LIGHTBURN,

Cumberland, Md.:

Would it not be well to send one company of the Eighth Ohio Cavalry to Beverly to remain with the First Virginia Infantry? I presume the latter have about reached Philippi, to which place a messenger has been sent with the information got from Roaring Creek.
