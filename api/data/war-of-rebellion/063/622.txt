SAINT LOUIS, MO., May 16, 1864.

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

I have just received orders from the Secretary of War to replace the Ninth Minnesota Infantry by a regiment of militia from Illinois or Iowa, and to send that regiment without delay to General Steele. You will therefore please order the Ninth Minnesota here for embarkation at once, and send it to report to Major-General Steele at Little Rock so soon as a militia regiment shall arrive to relieve it, or sooner if you can possibly spare if before the latter arrives. I shall leave here for Springfield I the morning, and will immediately send a militia regiment to report to you. I request that you will send me a copy of your order to carry out the above to Springfield, Ill.

By order of the Secretary of War:

N. J. T. DANA,

Major-General.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis:

Corporal Fore, Company F, First Missouri State Militia, with a small escort, killed one bushwhacker and wounded another, capturing both of their horses, yesterday near the line of Jackson County. Papers on the man killed were invoices from Captain W. H. Wooten, assistant quartermaster to Colonel W. C. Quantrill. The man answers the description of Quantrill. I have no doubt but he is the noted chief of guerrillas. He fought with his bowie-knife after being brought down by a pistol-shot. I have sent for more definite information.
