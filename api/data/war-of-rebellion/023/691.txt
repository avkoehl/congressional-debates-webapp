Brigadier General C. L. STEVENSON, Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Your telegram, stating that General Barton had gone by Bean's Station, has been received. I am directed by Major General E. Kirby Smith to state that if not pushed by the enemy you can make a stand at Tazewell or its vicinity. If pushed to the rear you can hold Bean's Station and Clinch Mountain. The enemy should be detained as long as possible. The general wishes to force him on the Tazewell and Maynardville road toward Knoxville. Barton's command should take the road from Bean's Station to Knoxville; Allston's cavalry should occupy the Maynardville route and cover road from Powell's Valley. Six thousand rations and four wagon loads of corn have been sent to maynardville for Barton's command and can be used by Alston. Keep the commanding general advised of all your movements, and notify him when transportation is wanted by rail for your brigade and for what number. All quiet at Chattanooga.
