GRANT'S HEADQUARTERS,

April 2, 1865-9.30 p.m.

General MEADE:

Miles has made a big thing of it and deserves the highest praise for the pertinacity with which he stuck to the enemy until he wrung from him victory. As the cavalry was coming down the Cox and River roads I am very much in hopes we will hear to-night of the capture of the balance of Heth's and Wilcox's divisions. I think a cavalry force had been thrown to the very bridge over which they expected to escape, in advance.
