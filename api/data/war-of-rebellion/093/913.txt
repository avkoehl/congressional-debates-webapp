Third, and Fourth Ohio, and Fourth Michigan Cavalry Regiments, and trust that I will invariably meet with the prompt and cordial support and co-operation of every officer and man in the command. The old First and Second Brigades have made a grand and noble record, one that we all feel justly proud of; but I trust that the new Second Brigade, formed by their union, will have a still brighter page in the history of our country and do honor to it parentage.

II. Captain Robert Burns, Fourth Michigan Cavalry, is announced as acting assistant adjutant-general of this brigade. He will be obeyed and respected accordingly.
