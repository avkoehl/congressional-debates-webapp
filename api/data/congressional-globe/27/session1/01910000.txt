Continued from JVo 11.
It was time to argue in that way when the decision
was reversed
Mr ALLEN argued that in no case should any
donation be taken from or charged to the stock de-
posited, or other fandb belonging to the Govern
ment, in the Bank or any of its branches, and he
said he should offer an amendment to that effect at
the proper time
Mr HENDERSON could not see how a sheer
act of donation could be made, and argued at
length against it
Mr WOODBURY said the Senator from Ken
tacky had put it to his candor to say whether it
was fair to argue, on possible contingencies He
(Mr W ) would put it to the candor of ihe Sena
tor to answei if redd not ntend to reverse the
decision of the ^pnate as to foreign stockholders if
he could He had argued from tac s as the> might
exist He read from Mr Clay's speech oí 1811,
in which he had based a strong argu-nent on U e
supposition that the stock of the proposed Bank
might be owned by foreigners
Mr CLAY thought the Senator seemed to en-
tertain a peculiar predilection for the speech tf
1811. He wished the Senator had as much res-
pect for another speech of his, delivered in 1816
With respect to the speech delivered m 1811,
he would say, once tor all, for his friends,
for his party, and posterity, that he had
voted against a Bank at that time on honest con-
victions But ehat was the difference between
1811 and 18162 At the latter period came the war
debt, wirt a rumed Treasury, that war coul' not
be carried on without the aid of t anks, he had
changed his opinion in favoi of a Bank, and heie
stood recorded all h o reasons for doing so, and he
was willing to be judged by the country and by
posterity When the chaiter came up in the other
House, he was m a position where he need not
have di-closed nit, opinion , and if he had been
cunning, he would not say discreet, he might have
concealed his opinions as other  had done, but he
preferred to open his bosom, lay bare his heart,
and give to his country and to his constituents
his reasons for the change his mini had undergone
—a change which had been in common with Madi
son, wita Governors Barbour and Pleasants of
Virginia, and all the illustrious compatriots
with whom it had been his good fortune to
act Does the Senator understand it now?
(said Mr C ) Can he appreciate it' Can he
reach that standard to be ab'e to admit that a
change made in common with all the patriots of
the age could f>ke place without any sinister mo-
tive? LBt the Senator from New Hampshire read
the speech of 1816 andanswer if he can, if he dare
Mr WODDBURY said h  would read it with
great pleasure, if the Senator would direct him
where to find a copy of it Hs believed the speech
was never published
Mr CLAY of Kentucky.   Oh yes
Mr WOODBURY, fhe speech wa* never pub-
lished The account which you gave oí it on your
return to Lexington was published But it did not
require the eloquence of the Sena or to convince
the world he had chrngel He had net quoted his
speech of 1811, however, t" aunt h'm 'iithchan-'
ing, but to s o v t lal the Senator had pursue 1 the
course of argument in that speech by supposi
tions, vhich i e h>i taken f1 e 1 berty of censur-
ing so freely in other* I ne vould permit
him, however, to make a choice h- wou d gieatl)
prefer the Senator of 1811 to th.it o  1816
After some furth i remarks fr m M srs CAL
HOUN, CLüYof Alabama, and ALL&N, the
question was taken on «inking out, and decided in
the affirmative, as follows
YEAS—Messrs Archer, Barrow, Bates, Bay-
ard, Berrien, Cboate, Clay of Kentucky, Clavton,
Dixon, Evans, Hendí rson, Huntington, Ker, Man-
gum, Merrick, Miller, Morehead, Phelps, Porter,

of Alabama, Cuthber , Fulton, King, Linn, Mc-
Roberts, Mruton, Nicholson, Pierce, Sevier,

Mr. ALLEN then moved to amend the amend-
ment to the effect that no donation made by the
Benk or us branches should bo charged to the
funds of the Government, and enforced the pro-
priety of adopting it at some length He mam
tamed ihat a- the Bank w as made the Treasury of
the nation—?s all its funds as stoc! holder or de-
positor, was in the custody of this new Treasury
Department, and are to all intents ar-d purposes,
public money in the Treasury by the very terms of
the char'er, i| was n clear viobtion of the Consti-
tution—which «ays that no money shall be drawn
from the Treasury unless appropriated by law—to
p  rmit grammes 'o be made by order of toe board
of directors ->nd ihe money lobe diawn from the
public coffers m virtue of such appropriations
Mr CALHOUN sa d it was surprising what an
effect a htüt complication had on the views of
gentlemen If the question was proposed whether
we should ambonze the Receiver General at New
STork or Charts on, to put then hands into the
Treasury and d spose of the public money m their
charge as their feelings might prompt them, there
was not a single Senator who would countenance
it f ra moment, and yet wnat was the proposition
of gentlemen on the opposit  side, in fact, but a
privilege to pe'tnit lhesc md vidua s who are di-
rectors in this Bank t > di pose t f the money (f the
Governme i , whic   is iiives ed in it?
He uiged that t'us complication of the affaiis of
Govern lert with a company of bankers on ths
ground assumed, might subjei t the finanr s of the
countrj to a cont o' utterly at war with the real
fiduc anes—the rep-e ^nta ives of the States and
the people—to whom Wc Constitu on committed
tms vital trust He said the case now b"for^ the
Senate siraplifi d the f>att r, «o ihat every ma*

ing capital of the cojntry was so large— xpedien
—ev°n wei° it const lauonal
3   That such a Bank as ta.i , so loosely guard
ed, and so badly located—so ill- imed and unne
cessaty—was not pioper, however a Bank may
have been m 1791, or 1816. The Supreme Court
had only deemed that a Bank was constitutional at
any time, and in any form, if first found to be ne-
cessary and proper oy Congress.
4   That experience in the- last seven years had
shown that a Nat onal Bank was not necessary as
a fiscal ag nt, because our fHcal operations had
been safely and promptly conducted without such
a Bank                             «■
5   That Government should not embark in trade
or banking, and especially on borrowed money.
It wai paltry and llljudged, and unprofitable. Bat
it should make merely a fiscal agent, with no
powers or func ions not necessary to mere public
objects
6   That the community and the Government
were both safer, if tie former were not borrowers
from th  pt bite Treasury, and the latter were not
dependent ft'their deposites and daily means on
the caprice and speculations of bank directors and
stockholders
7   That a National Bank of discount could not
improve or equalize exchanges, without costing as
much to the community in some way as exchanges
did now And that the exchanges were mercantile
matter?, and should be left to merchants, brokers,
and bankers, and were as cheap with them as with
the Bank, and if high, they corrected our trading
and our indebtedness, and were, and should be,
charged to the speculators, and w< uld be, whether
done with or without banks
8   That í Nitional Bank would not add to the
currency beyond ten millions in one hundred mil-
lions of paper, and even that ten no better than a
S ate bink situa ed at New York, and Us notes
made recei /able for public dues.
9   Thnt the capital was too large, if any was al-
lowed, unit s it wis made sufficient to control and
root out all State binks, or be 300,000,000 in-
stead of 30 000,000, and then nobody could check
or manado it Gallatin and Appleton say
ten or fifteen milhor s are enough for a mere ti cal
agent
10   Thf Bank, a^ one of discount, is also prema-
ture, as \ cannot chnck and control the bad banks

P„ ¡x cf E aland is m capital, all a Government

12   a Na íonal Bank of discount will not add
to the real capital cf the country, but increase our
is ues in on )i ce and contractions in others, and
conseqiPu  .•ssn.va'ion of existing evils
13   A Tw ona' Bank abroad as well as in the
Untied Stat s with power to discount and circu
late bi'l-, is presumed to be, by the best writers and
ihesoume t reason^r , injurious to the people—
ruining mo e often than benefiting—and should be
scouted fro itheGosernni nt and its fiscal ma-
chinery
