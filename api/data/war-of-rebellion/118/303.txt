Captain H. M. LAZELLE,

Asst. to Commissary-General of Prisoners, Washington, D. C.

CAPTAIN: I intended to make some verbal suggestions to you in relation to the inspection you are to make at Camp Parole which as I will not see you again before you leave I will put in writing. It is frequently said that soldiers are encouraged by the officers to leave the camp and go to their homes without authority. Make particular inquiries into this matter of officers and non-commissioned officers. Send for sergeant of Illinois regiments and ascertain what statements they make as to the manner of their treatment on arriving at Annapolis. Of course you will see what preparations are made for their reception, and from Colonel Sangster's report will know if there is any foundation for their complaints. Examine into the manner in which guard duty is done and find if my instructions on this subject are observed. Look into the condition of the camp fund and see what purchases are made from it. Inspect the hospital and see that the sick are comfortably provided for. Your orders cover all these points and I suggest them only that none may be lost sight of.

Yours, very truly,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary General of Prisoners.
