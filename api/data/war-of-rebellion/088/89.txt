Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I send up this morning a lieutenant of a Georgia regiment who deserted to us last night. He says they are very short of rations, so that with the allowance the men are hungry all the time. On Saturday, he says, their papers reported our fleet victorious over the Confederates in Mobile Bay. The Nashville (iron-clad) was sunk, and so was the Selma (cotton-clad).

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
