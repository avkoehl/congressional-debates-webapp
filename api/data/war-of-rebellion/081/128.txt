HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,June 17, 1864-9 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

Your two dispatch just received. Owing to the difficulty of the ground and darkness General Crawford's troops have not yet got into position. I had designed making an independent assault with his division. Nothing decisive can probably be done to-night, and General Crawford is directed to take position on the left of General Burnside's line, and in support of it. This will enable General Burnside to get his command better in order and refill ammunition, &amp;c. I have General Ayres' and General Griffin's divisions entirely in reserve. General Cutler is on the extreme left.

G. K. WARREN,

Major General.
