made without riaterial inconvenience to the De-

annexed to the report of the Secretary, com-
mencing at page 34, and marked inclosures No
1 to 4, inclusive
On the 13th of August, the negotiation in re-
lation to the paympntsupon the second bond was
renewed by a letter from Mr Biddle, the Presi-
dent of the bank, to the Secretaiy of the Treas-
ury, suggesting such changes in the places of
payment, and in the amounts to be paid at each
place, as he desitcd to have made, and referring
to the coirespondence, above detailed, with Mr.
Macalester, as the basis of the arrangement in
relation to this bond. This correspondence, thus
seopened, was continued between the officers of
the bank and those of the Treasury up to the
18th, of August, when all the places of payment,
íutd the sums payable at each, were mutually
agreed upon, and the negotiation was completed,
but in the mean time, and on the 15th of August,
a certificate of deposit, to the ciedit of the Treas-
urer of the United States, was issued by the
bank, and transmitted for the fiist installment of
$800,000, payable on that day, towaids the sec-
ond bond These documents will be found ap
pended to the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, nowunder consideration, commencing
at page 37, and marked F 8, 10, 11, 12
This gives a distinct and separate view of all
the matenal negotiations in relation to the pay-
ment of the second bond, the times of payment,
the places of payment, and the manner of pay-
ment Fiom the facts detailed it will be seen
that the bond was to be paid, and was paid in
three equal installments of about eight hundred
thousand each, on the 15th days of August, Sep
terrfber, and October, 1838, winch would occasion
theifirst installment tobe paid forty five days before
the bond became due and payable, the second in-
stallment fifteen days before,and the third install-
ment fifteen days after that time, that each install-
ment, on the day it became payable by the ai-
r&rfgement, Was to be, and was, deposited m the
ímnlc to the credit of the Treasure! of the United
States; that upon the strength of these deposits,
the Treasurer was to diaw his drafts upon the
bank, payable at the several places named, and
for the several sums agieed upon in the arrange-
ment, that those drafts weie to be paid by the
tank at the places at which they weie made pay
able, without being first presented at the bank,
or returned to it for payment, and that mteiest
was to cease upon the two installments anticipat-
ed, when the money was placed to the ciedit Of
the Tieasurer in the bank, and was to continue
upon the third installment until that, albo, was so
placed to his credit
This is the arrangement which the Secretary
of the Treasury did make for the payment of the
second bond, which, upon its face, became due
and payable on the 1st of October, 1838 That
the state of the Treasury íequired the anticipated
payments secuied by the anangement, seems to
"be made certain by the report of the Secietaiy,
and that the places and mannei of payment were
such as best suited the public wants and the con-
venience of the Department is shown by the whole
correspondence If, then, theie be fault on the
part of the Secretary, in consenting to the arrange
rnent, it must be because it was wrong to enter
iiifo a negotiation with the Bank of the United
States, chartered by the State of Pennsylvania,
and to conclude an arrangement for the antici-
pated payment of a debt which the wants of the
public Tieasury required, upon teims not only
convenient and advantageous to the public intei
ests and the public service, but upon which alone
payments could be anticipated, and because it was
wrong, by such an arrargement, to secure those
paym nts in money, which otherwise might be
made íoTreasury notes,and thus rendered wholly
unavailable to supply the wants of a reduced
Treasury Deep as my feelings of hostility have
been, and still arc, against this bank, both as a
national and State institution, I cannot carry
those feelings so far as to censure a faithful pub-
lic officer for acts like these, nor, when by oui
legislation we have driven lnm to these resorts
to supply our Tieasury placed under his charge,
can I suspect him of impioper motives for having
consented to negotiate with a dangerous banking
institution, when it was the only alternative left
to him to preserve the public faith, carry on the
business of the nation, and maintain its ciedit, or
condemn him for having accomplished these great
results by such means
I pass now to the sale of the third bond, and
the negotiations which preceded and accom-
plished that object The law authorizing that
sale, as has been before remarked, was introduced
into the Senate on the 2d of May, and the reso-
lution of inquiry on the 5th of April previous.
With his accustomed vigilance, the Secretary of
the Treasury anticipated the action of Congress
by opening, on the 8th of May, a correspondence
with an intelligent banker in each of the cities of
New York and Philadelphia, to inform himself
whethei, in case of the passage of a law like that
proposed, a sale could probably be made of one
or both of the bonds, either in the markets of our
own or a foreign country. Copies of the bill were
transmitted to each of these gentlemen, and their
early opinions solicited. Answers to these letters
were returned within a very few days, and both
expressed opinions wholly unfavorable as to the
prospect of a sale in this country, unless to the
bank itself, without the guarantee of the Govern-
ment for the payment of the bondi, while one of
the wi iters supposed that a sale might be effected
in Europe upon advantageous terms, and that the
agent of the bank in London might be induced,
" by weighty considerations, to enter the field as
apuichaser," and the other said "the bonds
have too short a time to run to warrant any rea-
sonable expectation of a sale of them in Europe,
on favorable terms, during the present rate of ex-
change " These letters will be found accompany-
ing the report of the Secretary, marked 6,1,2,3
The bill became a law, without any alteiation
of form, on the 7th of July. Under date of
the 9th, the Secietary wrote to N. M de Roths-
child & Sons, brnkers, of London, sending them
a copy of one of the bonds, and requesting them
to negotiate a sale in England if possible A copy
of the law was also tiansmitted On the 11th,
similar communications were addressed to the
Ameucan Minister at Pans, with a request that
he would consult ceitain bankers named, and
such other persons as he might think propei, and
learn if a sale of the bonds could be effected in
Fiance within the terms of the law On the 17th
of July, a gentleman of Baltimore, of known and
appioved qualifications for such a service, was
addressed by the Secretary, to learn if he would
consent, for the compensation of eight dollars per
day and the payment of his expenses, to go to
Euiope as the agent of the Department, to make
sale of the bonds In the mean time, and on the
9th of July, letters were addiessed to the presi
dent of one of the leading banks in each of the
cities of New Yoik and Boston, and to a gentle-
man in New Yoik, known as the resident agent
theie of the banking houses of the Rothschilds in
London and Pans, invoking the advice and aid
of thee individuals as to the sale of the bonds in
this country, or in any foreign market
Such were the efforts promptly maue by the
Secretary to secure a sale of these bonds in con-
formity with the provisions of the act of Congress
and upon the most favorable terms which could
be obtained The condition of the Tieasury,
and the consequent necessity for the sale of one
or both of the bonds, has been aheady seen in
the extracts from the report of the Secretary
before given.
Under date of the 23d of July, the gentleman
applied to to act as agent for the sale of the bonds
abroad, lephed to the Secre'ary's request, ex-
piessmg an opinion that, as the state of the money
maiket in Europe was peculiarly favorable, the
bonds might probably be sold there within the
limitations prescribed in the law, and possibly
upon terms more favorable " if the agency is
judiciously executed," but, characterizing the
bonds as " a less current or salable desciiption
of securities" than are oidmanly " tendered for
sale many maiket," and declining the agency at
the compensation proposed, butoffenngto under-
take it for a commission of one fourth of one per
cent upon the amount of the bonds, if sold, and
for the pay and mileage of a member of Con-
gress, in case of a failure to effect a sale (See
documents C 6 and 7 )
The letters of the Secretary to thegentlemen in
New York and Eoston were promptly answered;
the one from the agent of the foreign banking
houses, containing an offer foi the bonds, which
did not come withm the limitations of the law;
and the two others holding out no prospect of a
sale of either bond in this country, within the
terms of the law. The correspondence with the
two New York gentlemen was continued to great
length, covering the time fiom the 9th to the
27th of July, and embracing efforts to effect a
sale as well abioad as at home, but Without any
prospect of success
Inasmuch as the Secretaryis now charged with
a willingness, if not a desire, to be driven to make
the sale of these bonds to the bank itself, it will
be but just to him to make one or two references
to his coriespondence with these gentlemen, as
indicative of his feelings upon this point I will
read from his letter of the 18th of July, written
to George Newbald, Esq , President of the Bank
of America, New York. It will be found on
pages 23 and 24 of the report under considera-
tion, and is marked D 6 The first paragraph of
this lettei is in the following words-
" Sir I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of the 14tli instant I wrote you on yesterday in con-
sequence of observing in the Philadelphia newspapers
home intimations affecting the ciedit of the bonds of the
Bank of the United btates m the market It seems to be
evident that the m iker of these bonds intends that no other
coiporatlon or individual shall purchase them So many
suggestions injurious to their value have been made, and,
what ¡s more remarkable, considenng their obvious origin
and motive, have been listened to, that Í shall probably be
compelled either to bell the bonds lo Mr Oiddle, who id ex
peeted here m the course of the present week, or to sena
them abro id for sale "
Does this language, I ask, Mr President, does
this look like a desire, or even a willingness, to
make the sale to the bank' Does it look like a
wish to be compelled to make the negotiation
with Mr Biddle ' Do you believe, sir, that the
Presidentof the Pennsylvania bank will look upon
this language ai conveying such a kindly feeling
towaids himself and his institution ?   I will read
! tlie last paragiaph of this same  letter     It is in
i these woids
" Any bank which cooperates m the purchase of these
. bonds, it a point like New York, cannot I nl to derive great
i advantage liom tin operation    The money will pioDably
be required to be diavvn (or at the rue ot about half a mil
lion monthly    Hie dratts will be mostly sent to the South
and bouthwest, and thi greatei portion of them will be out,
tlnrtv, smy, and ninety days belore presented at bank "
Here are the very benefits which the charge
piesupposes it was the desire and intention of
the Secretary of the Treasury to confer upon the
Pennsylvania bank, specifically pointed out and
earnestly urged upon the Bank of America in
New York, and which, be it remembered, that
bank would not accept It cannot be necessary
that I should trouble the Senate with further ex-
tracts from this correspondence to rebut so
groundless and improbable a charge
The correspondence to which I have hitherto
alluded, in relation to the sale of these bonds, will
be found among the documents appended to the
Secretary's report, commencing at page 20, and
marked D, 1 to 17 inclusive
This brings me, in point of time, to the nego-
tiations which did take place between the bank
and the Secretary of the Treasury, and resulted
in the sale of one of the bonds upon the terms
prescribed m the law The first step m this ne-
gotiation is a letter under date of the 2tst of July,
written by Mr. Macalester to the Secretary of the
Tieasury, and is in the following words-
Washington, July 21, S838
Sir I have the honor to submit to you the following
proposition for the purchase of two bonds of the Bank ot
the United States chartered by Pennsylvania, referred to m
your advertisment of the 18th instant
1 will give for one or both of th<>m the par value, calcu
laled according to the rules for estimating the par value of
securities upon which interest has run for a time, but winch
securities have not reached maturity , the settlement to be
mad< on the 1st of August next, on which day I will deposit
the amount thereof, to the credit of the Tieasurer of the
United States, in special deposit m the Bank of the United
States in Philadelphia, m sjiecisor tts equivalent, this being
done, you will then execute to me an assignment of the
bonds
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
V MACALESTER.
