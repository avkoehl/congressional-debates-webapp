PAYMASTER-GENERAL.

The Paymaster-General reports that during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1865, $7,839,225.47 were paid to the Regular Army, while $300,738,635.95 were paid to volunteers, and that the total disbursements since June 30, 1864, to the date of his report, amount in the aggregate to $524,054,946.37. Payments amounting to $270,000,000 have been made to about 800,000 mustered-out troops. The highest number of additional paymasters in service during the fiscal year was 447; the number now in service is 210. All the troops retained in service been paid to June 30, 1865, and many organizations to August 31, 1865, and to all discharged troops in full to date of discharge.

The anticipated payments of bounties to soldiers, and three months" additional pay to officers mustered out, that has fallen due by reason of muster out, amount to $91,750,000.

The whole sum disbursed by the Pay Department since the commencement of the war, viz, from July 1, 1861, to July 1, 1865, amounts to $1,029,239,000.

The total losses and defalcations during the same period, if nothing should be recovered, amount to the sum of $541,000, and it is believed that not less than half of this amount will be recovered. The total expenses of disbursement, including all pay and allowances, commutation of quarters, fuel, and traveling expenses, for four years and four months, amount to $6,429,600.

Thus it is seen that the costs of disbursement to armies in the field, and amid all the hazards of unexampled war, and including all losses and expenses, are less than three-fourths of 1 per cent.

COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF SUBSISTENCE.

The subsistence stores required during the year for distribution to the armies in the field have, as during the earlier years of the war, been purchased in the principal markets of the Northern States. The facilities and cost of transportation to the various points where they were required for issued, the relative prices of the different markets, and a due regard to the general commercial interests of the country, have governed the Subsistence Department in apportioning those purchases among the several market centers of the country. As New Orleans is gradually resuming a healthy commercial condition, a considerable portion of the supplies required for distribution from that point can be obtained in that market. Although the present general condition of the Southern States is not such as to afford a large amount of supplies, still subsistence officers are able in some parts of those States to enter into contracts for the partial supply of the troops serving therein.

The principal purchasing officers have exhibited much ability in the performance of their duties and great fidelity to the interests of the country. The principal commissaries immediately responsible for the subsistence of the several armies in the field have discharged the important and often difficult duties or receiving, protecting, and
