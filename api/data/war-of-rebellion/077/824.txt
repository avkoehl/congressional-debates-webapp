I will respectfully state that we entered the fight with eighty- seven guns. We lost 4 killed and 45 wounded, which speaks more for the undaunted bravery and heroism of one and all on that day than anything I could say. It is hard to discriminate where all did their duty so nobly.

I have the honor to be, yours, &amp;c.,

A. HARRIS,

Colonel, Commanding Fourteenth Texas.

Lieutenant LINDSAY.

Numbers 117. Reports of Brigadier General Claudius W. Sears, C. S. Army, commanding brigade.

OCTOBER 5, 1864.

I find the rear of the enemy's position like this:

MAP.

My command is at the point a. I have a very difficult position to deploy upon; am sending out my skirmishers and they have commenced firing, but few are in position. Am crowding them forward; have to debouch around the bend in the bayou. I will form line of battle as soon as I can drive their skirmish line far enough back, and will push the matter as far as the honor of our arms may seem to demand.

Very respectfully, yours,

C. W. SEARS,

Brigadier-General.

General FRENCH.
