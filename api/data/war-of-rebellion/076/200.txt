you left them this morning. General Palmer is waiting for General Hooker to advance his line before he advances Johnson and Baird. He will then keep pace with them. The bridge will be finished in half an hour. The battery on the hill is completed, and has been firing at rebel lines. No change in enemy's position. They are strengthening their works in front of Davis. Slight skirmish fire kept up along the line.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

NEAR BRIDGE ON MAIN ROAD TO ATLANTA, THROUGH GENERAL PALMER'S LINES,

July 20, 1864-3 p. m.

[General THOMAS:]

GENERAL: Things remain here as you left them this morning. General Palmer is waiting for General Hooker to advance before pushing forward Johnson and Baird, who will keep pace with General Geary when he starts. The battery on the hill is finished, and has been firing into what was supposed to be the rebel skirmish line. There is no perceptible change in the enemy's position. They have developed a piece or two of artillery, firing apparently by guess at the bridge they are building near here. The battery cannot be seen from any position on this side of the creek, and it is fair to presume that those at the battery cannot see the bridge. It will be done in an hour.

Very respectfully,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Rebs attacked us about 4 o'clock at the junction between Twentieth and Fourteenth Corps, McCook's and Knipe's brigades, and were repulsed. Attack repeated and repulsed again. The enemy is still moving troops to our left, as they have been all day.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

The attack was very fierce and determined. Colonel McCook's adjutant was killed.
