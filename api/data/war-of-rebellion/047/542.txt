HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C. December 5, 1863.

Brigadier General JOHNSON HAGOOD,

Commanding, &amp;c., James Island, S. C.:

GENERAL: I am instructed to say to you that while the movements of the enemy appear to indicate an attempt to operate within the limits of the Second and Third Military Districts, rather than any effort to effect a lodgment within your district, nevertheless your troops should be held constantly on the alert, and ready for any effort to surprise you.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

[THOMAS JORDAN,]

Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., December 5, 1863.

Brigadier General JOHNSON HAGOOD,

Commanding, &c., James island, S. C.:

GENERAL: Your telegram, of the 3rd of December, relative to the development of the enemy's mortar batteries on Morris Island, has been received by the commanding general, whose views are as follows:

A concentrated fire of all the mortars on the enemy's works near the north end of Morris Island has long been in contemplation, but the want of shells has prevented its accomplishment. It is on this account that nearly all the mortars have been so long silent. There is one vacant chamber on Sullivan's Island and three at Fort Johnson prepared for the mortars now at Batteries Haskell and Lamar. Those at Simkins should not be removed until the enemy's fire shall have actually shown their position to be no longer tenable, and the same may be said of the 8-inch shell guns which must remain in position to the last.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

[H. WEMYSS FEILDEN,]

Captain, and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., December 5, 1863.
