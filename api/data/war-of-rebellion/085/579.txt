SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 3, 1864.

Major-General HOOKER,

Columbus:

I will send you a map of Missouri. We are now having a rather lively time, and any troops that could be justly expected to go in pursuit of the 12,000 to 15,000 raiders now threatening Saint Louis, Rolla, and Jefferson City would be in good time. Thanks to the 100-days' men from your department this department is safe. But we want you to gather a force equal to two-thirds of that of the raiders to operate against them.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
