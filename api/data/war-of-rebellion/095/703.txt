The First Division had an excellent location on an irregular ground, drained thoroughly well be nature; water was abundant and good. The soil on which the Second Division was settled was more retentive of moisture, but one that could have been well drained had the probability of a prolonged stay or the character of the weather rendered it necessary. Good water was scarce in this vicinity; the different regimental commands had dug wells, but the water obtained at no great distance from the surface was not clear, and, except when freshly drawn, had a surface-water taste. The Third Division was situated in a belt of woods; water was plentiful and good in the ravines. The division field hospitals were settled int he neighborhood of their commands upon good sites. The following represent their constitution at this time:
