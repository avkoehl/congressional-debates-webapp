HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 31, 1862.

General W. B. FRANKLIN:

Please detail a brigade at once to go to New Bridge to support Captain Duane in throwing across his pontoon bridges. It would be well to throw over the troops as soon as the first brigade is passable. The general commanding says there must not be a moment's delay in this.

Very respectfully,

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.

McCLELLAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

June 1, 1862-11.25 a. m. (Received 12.45 p. m.)

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

A severe battle commenced on the left of our line at about 1.45 p. m. yesterday, and the heavy firing, which only ceased at dark, resumed again at about 5.30 this morning. The details of yesterday's operations have not yet been ascertained, but our troops under General Keyes were driven back until General Heintzelman's corps came up and maintained his ground till this morning, when the battle commenced again, and there has been very heavy firing up to this moment. The following result comes from General Heintzelman:

All firing has ceased. The enemy in repulsed wherever he has appeared. General Hooker, with Fifth and Sixth New Jersey and a portion of Colonel Ward's (late Birney's) brigade, drove the enemy with the bayonet in gallant style more than a mile.

General McClellan is now absent in front.

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.
