HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 25, 1864-2.45 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

We have commenced a mine that will reach the batteries of the enemy in our front by a reach of 115 yards. I have given orders for all the necessary changes of the line to make the work ordinarily secure. We want about 7,000 sand-bags or more. I think we can break the line of the enemy in due time if we can have the necessary facilities. We want heavy guns very much. Can we have the sand-bags?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 25, 1864-3 p.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Ninth Corps:

I have directed Duane to send you an engineer officer and a company of sappers, and Hunt to send you sand-bags and siege guns. I am delighted to hear you can do anything against the enemy's line, and will furnish you everything you want, and earnest wishes for your success besides. I would have been over to see you to-day, but certain movements of the enemy on the left have kept me here.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 28, 1864-11 p.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

The firing is in front. It seems to be an attack of enemy. Have sent out to ascertain the result. Will let you know as soon as we hear.

A. E. BURNSIDE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 25, 1864-11.15 p.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

The firing commenced on our left and was evidently brought about by the noise of our working parties attracting the enemy's attention. No ground has been lost. All is now comparatively quiet and the work will go on. The object of the work is to so strengthen the skirmish line as to really become the main line. The telegraph has been out of order, otherwise we should have reported earlier.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 25, 1864.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

I have sent to Comstock at City Point for 8,000 sand-bags for you, to be sent as soon as possible. Expect every minute to hear from him. I will be over to see you this evening.

HENRY J. HUNT,Brigadier-General.
