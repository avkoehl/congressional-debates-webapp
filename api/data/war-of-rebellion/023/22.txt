General Carter is now en route to Big Creek Gap, and I feel it to be my duty to concentrate my division at the earliest moment practicable. The enemy may not have evacuated Cumberland Gap, but simply resorted to a ruse.

I request it may be replaced by that time by a train of at least a hundred wagons for my troops alone. If the Corinth depot should be supplied from Eastport of course a larger train will be re
