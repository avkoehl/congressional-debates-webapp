that some of Quantrill's force is still west. Unless you have positive knowledge that this knowledge that this is not case, I should like to have scout made with a pretty heavy force through Carroll into Searcy County as far south as Richland Creek, and have Colonel Love and his force there attacked and captured and driven out. He made quite a fight with the First Arkansas on the 25th ultimo. I will not orders troops out such weather, but if you can make this movement and keep your men comfortable you can do so. Inform me what action you take. Love's force is not less than 800 men when all together. I have no intimation when paymasters will be here; certainly not before the 12th, however.

Lieutenant-Colonel BISHOP,

Chief of Cavalry, Fayetteville, Ark.:

How far is King's River from Fayetteville? The troops cannot be moved to the Arkansas River at present, but may be disposed of east and west of Fayetteville where there is forage. Keep a large portion of the stock away from the post and concentrate only on the approach of the enemy. Keep the train out for forage all the time.
