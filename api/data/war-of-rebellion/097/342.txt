Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The only disposable cavalry I have is my escort. I will send an officer and forty men to communicate with Sheridan. I believe the road is all open to him. I have sent the orders to Mackenzie.

Major-General MEADE:

Let Warren move in the way you propose and urge him not to stop for anything. Let Griffin go on as he was first directed.

As you are sending to Sheridan send him word of all the dispositions making to aid him and tell him to take general direction of the forces sent to him until the emergency for which they are sent is over.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Warren was ordered some time since to push Griffin promptly down the plank road to Sheridan. I have now ordered him to move with the rest of his corps as light as possible and push down the road running south from the White Oak road to Dinwiddie to attack the enemy in rear, and look out to get over to the plank road if they turn on him too strongly. The messenger to Sheridan had not left when these orders were sent and Sheridan was notified of them. The officer has gone now, so that I cannot add what you desire about his taking command, but I take it for granted he will do so, as he is the senior. I will instruct Warren to report to him. I find it reported that among Sheridan's prisoners is one from Lilley's brigade, Walker's division, Gordon's corps. Formerly Hoke commanded a brigade in this division, from whence I think has arisen the rumor that Hoke is in front of Sheridan, the men often giving the old name of their organizations.
