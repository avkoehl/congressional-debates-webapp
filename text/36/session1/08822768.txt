THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

large number of persons of foreign birth. The
emigration of that class of persons was very great,
commencing prior to 1850, and the various courts
in the county of St. Louis, for some two or three
months preceding a general election, are always
engaged jn conferring the right of naturalization
upon those persons who, by the laws of the United
States, are entitled to citizenship. Voters are
therefore multiplied"—and multiplied not dishon-
estly—by the admission to citizenship of those
w|io have resided in the United States for five
years, and have proved to the satisfaction of the
courts that they are attached to the institutions of
our country, and who swear to support the Con-
stitution of the United States, and abjure all alle-
giance to every foreign prince, potentate, State,
or sovereignty whatever. The vote for Congress
in the city of St. Louis—I now speak of the city
only—in August, 1858, was 16,610. There was
a mistake of 180 votes at one of the precincts in
the city of St. Louis; but in stating the aggregate
vote cast for members of Congress, that mistake
has not been corrected. I admit that, so far, the
committee have done justice to the sitting mem-
ber by adding these votes to his poll.
I, however, desire to ascertain the number of
votes cast in that congressional district in the'
year 1858. I therefore make the deduction of 180
votes erroneously returned in the seventh ward
for Mr. Blair, and I find that there were cast:
In the city of St. Louis 16,610
Zn tile county outside of tlie city  2,566
Making a total of 19,176
But there was an election which took place in
the city of St. Louis in April, 1859, eight months
after the congressional election had taken place.
In that election there were 17,263 votes cast,
being an increase of more than 650 votes over the
vote cast in the congressional election of 1858—a
greater difference in the vote of the city in these
two elections, eight months apart, than the gen-
tleman from Maryland [Mr. Webster] has
stated. But in August, 1859, an election was
held forjudge of the supreme court, judge of the
circuit court, clerks of courts, and for other county
officers in the county of St..Louis. The total
number of voters at that election, in the county
of St. Louis, was 17,170, nearly 100 votes less
than had been cast for Mayor in tho city four
months preceding that"time.
X desire, however, to institute a comparison be-
tween the votes cast in the city of St. Louis in
the congressional and mayoralty elections. You
will find that, in the city election, Mr. Wyman,
the American candidate, lost votes; he lost more
votes than Colonel Bogy, the Democratic candi-
date, lost, when compared with the congressional
election. The total number of votes given in the
city of St. Louis, ill August, 1858, in the congres-
sional election, was 16,610, of which
Barret received   6,003
Breckinridge    4,891
Blair, (deducting tlie 180 votes)  5,714
Total 16,610
At the city election of 1859 the candidates for
Mayor received the number of votes as stated:
Bogy, (Demonat) 5.372
Wyman, (American)  3;6'>3
Filley, (Republican)  8,276
Total 17,271
Personal considerations and local questions
caused an increase in the vote of Mr. Filley over
Mr. Blair, and a loss of votes to the other candi-
dates for mayor, as compared with the congres-
sional election.
The contestant alleges many illegal votes were
cast for the sitting member. Some illegal votes
are proved to have been cast for him. Illegal
w votes were cast for the contestant. The majority
of the committee allege that 602 votes ought to be
deducted from the poll of the sitting member, be-
cause the persons casting those votes were not
entitled to vote at that election. From my exam-
ination of the testimony, I cannot agree in the
conclusion of thecommittee. The testimony does
aotshow thatnumber of illegal votes to have been
castfor the sitting member. The committee states
that there was a large increase of the vote of 1858
over the vote cast for the candidate for Congress
la 1856. This is true. And because the vote
cast for Mr. Barret is much larger than that cast
for Mr. Reynolds in 1856, the committee ask this
House'-to infer that many of the,votes cast for
Mr. Barret are illegal. The increase of voters at
the elections in the western States, I have no
doubt, astonishes the people of the eastern States.
They have no adequate conception of the increase
of our population; they know not how rapidly
our villages and cities increase. This increase
from election to election,in our voting population,
is so great that they are induced to believe there
are fraud andillegalvotingat our elections. Hence,
as in this case the testimony does not establish
that a sufficient number of illegal votes were cast
for Mr. Barret to dispossess him of his seat, the
majority of the committee wish you to infer that
it is so, and therefore to decide this question in
favor of Mr. Blair. To lead you to this conclu-
sion, the majority of thecommittee have instituted
a comparison of the number of votes cast in 1856
with those cast in 1858, and have particularly invi-
ted your attention to the great increase of votes in
some particular precincts. In the St. Louis dis-
trict the vote for Congress was, in 1856, for—
Kcnnctt, (American)  5,549
Btair    6,035
Reynolds  2,281
13,865
In 1858.
Breckinridge, (American) a  5,668
Blair  6,451
Barret. .*  7,057
19,176
The four precincts specified by the majority of
the committee, in which, from the increased vote,
they wish the members of this House to believe
many illegal votes were given to Mr. Barret, are
'thus stated in the report:
Gravoi s precinct.
1856—Kennett. (American,) 47 ♦ Reynolds, (Democrat,) 4;
Blair, 4.
1853—Breckinridge, 24; Bairet, 1.03; Blair, 7.

1858—Breckinridge, (American,) 370; Barret, (Democrat,)
3,349 ; Blair, 586.
Increase, 1,030 votes.
I invite tho attention of the House to a state-
ment of the vote at four other precincts, all in the
city of St. Louis, which shows an increase of the
vote of 1858 over that of 1856 of 1,309; whilst in
the precincts mentioned by the committee, the in-
crease of votes is only 1,030. In the precincts I
have here selected, the majority of the committee
allege there were, in 1858,' 41 illegal votes cast—
32 for Mr. Barrett, and 9 for Mr. Blair:
Second ward—eastern precinct.
1856—Kennett, 56 ; Blair, 624 ; Reynolds, 286.
1858—Bieckinndge, 53; Blair, 801; Bairet, 443.
Fijlh ward—eastern product.
1856—Kennett, 967; Blair, 300; Reynolds, 165.
1858—Breckinridge, 1,087; Blair, 349; Bairet, 693.
Fifth ward—western prccinet.
J856—Kennett, 39 ;• Blair, S3 ; Reynolds, 22.
1856—Bieckinndge, 39; Blair, 117; Barret, 96.
Sixth, ward—eastern precuict.
1656—Kennett, 696 ; Blair, 254; Reynolds, 70.
1858—Breckinridge, 629; Biair, 202; Barret, 372.
-Aggregate.
1856—ICennott, 1,758; Blair, 1,271; Reynold^ 543.
1858—Breckinridge, 1,808; Blair, 1,469; Barict, 1,604.
Total votes given at above named precincts.
1856 3,572
1858 4,881
Increase 1,309
But I desire to call the attention of the House
particularly to the vote of the two precincts of the
fifth ward of the city of St. Louis. The commit-
tee does not allege, nor does the contestant, (I
believe,) that a single illegal vote was given in
this ward. The increase of the total vote of 1858
over that of 1856, in this ward, is 795; and the
vote of Mr. Barret cxceeds that of Mr. Reynolds
602 votes. The total vote in this ward is increased
more than fifty per cent, in two years. The vote
given to Mr. Barret is more than fourfold that
given to Mr. Reynolds; and yet, with this great
increase of vote to Mr. Barret, thecommittee does
not claim tha,t evei^pne illegal vote was cast for him:
Fifth ward, both precincts.
1858—Kennett, 1,006; Blair, 393; Reynolds, 187.
1858—Breckiniidge, 1,126; Biair, 466; Barret, 789.
Total vote in fifth ward in 1856 1,586
" " 1858   2,381
I think I have shown the fallacy of the infer-
ence that the increased vote at the election of 1858
over that of 1856, or the increase of Mr. Barret's
vote over that of Mr. Reynolds's, was caused by
illegal votes. This increased vote is the result of
the increase of population and the excitement of
the canvass.
And, Mr. Speaker, there is a remarkable fa&t
connected with this election. This was an elec-
tion, not merely for a jnember of Congress, but
for four Senators and twelve members of the State
Legislature, from the city arid county of St. Louis;
for a sheriff, marshal, and other officers. There
were twenty-five officers elected at that election,
for which every person who was entitled to vote
for a member of Congress was entitled to vote.
There were, also, some ward aud township offi-
cers elected at Uiat election by the qualified voters
of the ward anu township. There were more than
seventy*candidates, and twenty-four persons to
be elected by the qualified voters of this congies-
sional district. Each party had its candidates
in the field, and it is to be presumed that each
party voted its own ticket, in that election the
Democratic party was successful. The majority
by which members of the Legislature were elected
was less than Mr. Barret's majority; and it
therefore must be apparent that, if Mr. Barret
was returned to this House by illegal votes, the
entire Democratic ticket m the county of St. Louis
was indebted for its success also to illegal votes.
You may, therefore, be desirous to know whose
election was contested, and the result of that con-
test. But one case of contest occurred, and that
was in the election of sheriff. The ma^rity re-
ceived by the person elected sheriff was less than
onehumired. I believe-it was only eighteen votes.
That contested election, I believe, was brought
before the proper tribunal in the county of St.
Louis, and the officer who received the certificate
was sustained.
Mr. BLAIR, (contestant.) It was never tried.
Notice was given. Notice of contest was given,
but it was held to be imperfect. The gentleman
has said that the majority of the national Demo-
cratic ticket was only 18; and yet I got as many
votes as the sheriff on my ticket.
Mr. PHELPS. The majority for sheriff was
18. There was an election for four State senators
and twelve representatives. J.D. Stevenson, who
was a candidate for State senator on the same
ticket with the contestant, received more votes in
the county of St. Louis than the contestant did.
The majority of the Democratic candidate for
senator, who received thtl smallest \ote and was
elected over Mr. Stevenson, was a little more
than 200, instead of 607, which is my colleague's
[Mr. Barret] majority over tho contestant. Mr
Stevenson, and the others who w<-re on the same
ticket with him for the Legislature of Missouri,
never attempted to contest the right of those
who had received the certificates of election. Is
is not strange, upon this state of facts, that this
contest is now brought into this House? The
sixteen members of the Legislature who were
elected at the same time and upon the same ticket
with the sitting member, but with less majority,
had not their seats contested. What, then, does
this mean? Is not justice done in the Legislature
of Missouri?
If it were an illegal election in this' instance, it
was equally an illegal election in the case of the
members elected on the same ticket with the sit-
ting member to the Legislature of the State. Yet,
sir, it is passing strange, if it were an illegal elec-
tion, that notice of contest was nover served upon
one of them by the rival and defea'ed candidates
who were on the tickei with Mr. Blair. Is it
that justice is not to be done here, and members
are called upon to vote on this case with regard
only to their party predilections ? If there had
been any good ground for contest, do you not sup-
