Poitponeme it of fourih ins'ahnent—Mr. Alhetton.
H, o! &¿¡a
test involved in the acton of this House; between
the General and Slate Governments, and some
seem to feel that they have special!; in charge the
interest of the former Toi mv part, I do not
view it in that light, noi do I tcel myself more the
friend and agent oí the State whicn sent me h re,
than the friend and agent of the General Govern-
ment I feel that in this matter I am the common
friend of both, and that the action of this, House
is paternal, that in a controversy hke tint, for tVe
possession ot a fund which each claims as trustee,
that the aojuslment ot tie diffeierce is referred to
us and the co-ordmate branches for an adjustment
upen print íples of political ecmitv, looking to the
convenience and well being of both claimants
I cainot comprehend how the Gei eral Govern-
ment has any adverse or paramount lights in this
fund to the people of the States It w as they who
infused into it all its life and vigoi, and bestowed
upon it all its capacities, among which «as the
power to levy and collect a íevenue off them-
selves, to such amount as was necessaiy to earn
on and carry out the functions they had bestowed
upon it, and predestined it to fulfil for ther ow n
good
Now, sir, if from accidental causes in the due
execution of the established re/enue lavs, more
his been collected than was necessary foi purposes
of Government, to whom does it belong—the agent
who collected it, or the principal of whom it was
collected? I, sn, consider it a common right of
the people in a common surplus in the safe keeping
of the United States, the accumulation and inac-
tivity of which, at the time Congress acted upon it,
was paialyzing the enterpiise and industry oí the
comli} M me} , ws. know, su, is the geneiatoi of
en'eipn e, and had this fund been peimitted to have
lemamed an miclive accumulating mass m the
National Ireasui}, it Mould, in all piobabilitv,
has e checked the mdustiv and entei prise of the
country, as injuriously as its subsequent removal
to the State banks stimulated them, and thereby
greatly diminished the natural lesources of t! e
Treasury.
Add to this, sir, that it was a source of jealous
watching with our intelligent countiymen, lest its
influence might have been diverted to party puipo
se«, instead of INational Indeed, sir, I have heard
whispers that the party who once had the entire
control of it, w eie less successful in elections since
it has been \\ rested fro n their contiol, bat whether
there be anv foundation foi theun hantable surmi-
ses that this fund had my agency m the success,
I know not, and theietoie cannot say
Nor can I pretend to say positively that had this
surplus remained m the Bank of the United States,
the result would have been different from that
which followed its deposite m the Stite banks—if
the Bank of the Uniied States wis managed by fal-
lible human agents, and t is probable, at least pos-
sible, that they weie liab'e to the influence of the
sime passions ana frailees which chaiactei zed the
agents of the b ate banks
This is all possible, but not necessaiy to d^emine
now The smplus u«sremoved to the S'atebmks,
which cannot no.vbe undone or i «called
Cc tigress, in the passage of the deposite law,
seericd to ha\ e in \ lew lo w ird oft fiom ti t coun-
try bie injuiious effect'- ot that disposi ion of them
To ascertain the real effect of that disposition,
we should mqu r°, bow those deposites found those
State banks and the business of the country de-
pendant npon mem, and how did they leave them'
Sir, the deposites found them do ng a neat and
profitable business.upon then ow i actual capital,and
and aflordmg the countij a paper cunencv ,convarti-
ble at all times,r>nd almost at all places,mto haid mo-
ney Thecoumi} wasiuJIof hardmonej The busi-
ness pursuits were prudent, safe and económica!
Few ventured beyond their means But when this
surplus insinuated itself into the operations of those
Stat" banks, they giew mad with avarice Agents
were emploj ed to sue at the Tieaiury foi favor ,
and when obtained, they pouied their issues upon
the country, based upon those favors, until they
maddened it with the spu it of w lid and reckl^s
speculation Discounts were mcieased, meichants
enlarged then stocks, and their customers enlarged
their  puichases     Farmers, enlarged their opera
turns, and speculator  theirs, and the ¡.pint of tne
times, and the facility of obtaining accommoda-
tions, seduced some of the best men in the country
from the occupations of their who'e lives, mo
hazardous and profitless emerpnses, and hus see-
med to be going wild the whole business of life
Congress seeing this, and correelly appreciating
the cause, passed this deposite law as a corrective
I suppose it was in the contemplation of Congress,
that, by withdraw mg the deposites from the State
banks, it would nece&sanly decrease their
issues, and subject them to call in those which « as
based upon Ihe surplus, and that by paicellmg it
araing the States, at about uV> same ratio it had
been collected of them, it wouldm some measure
replenish the circulating medium, which would be
constantly íunnuig into <lmse banks, to enable them
to meet their engagements to the Government
The western States, or at least Indiana, was pe-
culiarly situated at this time, and under peculiar
embaí ras=ments In addition to her State debt, her
citizensowed an immense private bank debt based
upon this same surplus and which was contracted
in the da>s of the experiment and induced by the
action oí th  Government, by throwing the im-
mense sail plus mto the State banks, and stimulating
then action, with a t lew to supplant the receding
issues of the United States Bank, lest the ptople
might mourn its loss
Now, sir, this basis of the bank issues is with-
drawn, and the notes of our people are in those
banks to redeem those issues, and a large surplus
portion of the same issues hav e run into the Na-
tional Treasury thiough (he land office", and is
there a charge against our banks, as deposits, it is
(he National Treasury that the banks must raise
funds fc which we aie tnld must be pa 1 m haid
niopci' Xiom whence ire those b->nks to delive tns
haid i lonej out fiom ti e people, whose notes the}
ho'cl, and the} , in turn, must cocice haid money
fiom then debtors, and so the process must go on,
i aking together the whole amount of hard money m
the country, to be placed in the Treasury, and
from thence issued out to those m the employment
of Government? Add to this, sir, the constant
dram that is running from our pockets, m hard
money, thiough ihe land offices, to the same point,
and for the same purpose Both those drains, sir,
are too much foi an} country to bear, especially in
times of depressed mark ls
Sn,it a as with an eve to adjust this °tate of
th ng that Congress passed t lis íemedial, benefi-
cent and paiental deposite law, and directed this
surplus, which had done so much harm, to be deli-
vered over to the States, the effect of w Inch was
to make the banks debtoi to the States instead of
the National Tieasury, and thus to change the di-
rection of the golden eurient
Put some gentlemen tell us now that that th^re is
nos trp'i's, that the act is «pent, and nolhin0 remains
t< r it to operate upon Whi sc1 Where has

upon the Trer sun, and if misdirected b} the agents
of the Gov eminent, or absorbed by other appropi i-
c>uons, it is a fair demand of the States upon the
Tieasurv, and so far remains to b° executed
Sir, it is nnp<rtant to mv State that it should be
executed Much of her legislation is based upon
its reception, her institutions oí ¡earning look to it
her system of internal improvements looks to it, and
her citizens look to it as a fund to resu c tate, m
s< me degree, the fountain of their currency in these
dark da}s
\.nd as it is submitted to us, ?s the common
arbiters oi the General and Slate Governments,
let us adjust it in such v\a} as the least ínconve-
rierce will íesult fion il and in do ng this, we
reed not consider for a moment the condition oi the
niUonal Treasury It can speak mone} mto exis-
tence with our assent and in doing so, a \ i1! in-
crease both the quantity and quality of the circu-
lating medium, now oppiessively defic «>nt In de-
ciding thisquestion, it is unimportant to me whether
one oi the other s de is correct m their de loot ins

pu'e to Congress or the Executive partialtiy in
those things, not s it grows out of the natuie oi
our position But it is true thit tho'e States fa-

Su, patting aside a1! other considerations, to re-
tract the legislation of the last year would be disre-
putable to the nation, v hcthet the policy of the act
was wise or unwise It would be a confession lhat
this grave body and the co-ordinate branches had
had acted upon a mistaken assumption oí facts, or
lhat they were so short sghted that they could not
appreciate the real condition of the Treasury or
warns of the Government Foi my part, whether
the Tieasurv be flush or empty, I am for its mo-
ney going to its predestined oDject It will there
do much good, and prevent much harm, and its
absence from the National Treasmy can work no
inconvenience, fc/, I again repeat, we can speak
money into the Treasurv, and we who are for the
democracy of numbers can have no objection to
ibi unmg it in lhatwi}, for b} ppicellng it out
with the States, it goes mt i the hands of the neces-
sitous and boi row mg class, and will tend to keep up
the puce of hoor and pioduce, and when it is to be
refunded in the redemption of Tre su y lióles, it
comes limn tl e pockets of ihe wei'thv—-these wh 
"clothe in purj lc and fine linen, ipd lare sumptu-
ously every day " When things n Mime their na-
tural tone, it will be time enough to talk about le-
gislating it from the State Treasuries
Such are my views
