sent to Wilmington for exchange according to the agreement entered into with Commissioner Ould by yourself. This will cause great hardship to these prisoners, as they will have to be marched across the country without adequate provision for their subsistence or comfort. On the score of humanity I would ask that General Schofield be instructed to receive them in accordance with the agreement on the faith of which they were sent to Wilmington.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

Major General R. F. HOKE,

Commanding C. S. Forces, Wilmington, N. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 19th instant, proposing to deliver to me 2,500 prisoners which have been set apart for exchange at Wilmington. I presume this proposition is based upon some new arrangement for the exchange of prisoners of which I have not been officially informed. Please inform me on what terms you propose to deliver the prisoners.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

General R. E. LEE, Commanding:

General Bragg telegraphs that Schofield refuses to receive prisoners at Wilmington. This is contrary to agreement with General Grant and occasions inconvenience and delay.

Secretary of War.

HEADQUARTERS, February 21, 1865.

Honorable J. C. BRECKINRIDGE, Secretary of War:

Have telegraphed Bragg to urge reception of prisoners according to agreement and have written to General Grant.

R. E. LEE.

WILMINGTON, February 21, 1865.

General COOPER:

GENERAL: The Federal commander refuses to receive prisoners or to entertain any proposition in regard to them. On the contrary, he seems to avail himself of their presence to push his operations, and General Hoke was compelled to move them to the rear. No more should be sent for the present.

BRAXTON BRAGG.
