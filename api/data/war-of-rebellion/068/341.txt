WARRENTON JUNCTION, May 2, 1864.

Brigadier-General FERRERO:

The general commanding directs that you send a scouting party in the direction of Falmouth. There are reports, but not reliable, of rebels having crossed below Fredericksburg.

LEWIS RICHMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Copy to Colonel Griffin.)

BRISTOE, May 2, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel L. RICHMOND:

The reports named in your telegram have been received here and scouts were sent out yesterday and to-day. Will send out scout tonight in compliance with orders.

S. G. GRIFFIN,

Colonel, Commanding.

BRISTOE, May 2, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel RICHMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Since receipt of your telegram Colonel Morris has report result of this afternoon scout. They went some 4 miles beyond Brentswille without finding even a guerrilla. Do you desire a scout sent to a greater distance to-morrow? The vedettes have been thrown farther out and strengthened.

S. G. GRIFFIN,

Colonel, Commanding
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS,Warrenton Junction, Va., May 2, 1864-11 a. m.

Major General A. E. BURNSIDE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

GENERAL: Captain Cloke, Company B, Third New Jersey Cavalry, sent out yesterday a. m. with the Fifty-first Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteers to make a reconnaissance in the vicinity of Warrenton, has just returned. He reports that after repeated inquiries made of citizens (both male and female) and contrabands, he can learn of no Confederate force being of having been in that vicinity, but that small squads of guerrillas are in the habit of visiting Warrenton daily. He made a reconnaissance in front and left of the town, but could see nothing of the enemy. I am satisfied that the report made on the 30th ultimo, to the effect that a Confederate force had crossed the Warrenton road, is without foundation. The whole force of cavalry and infantry have returned.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
