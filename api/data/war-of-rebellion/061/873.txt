Artillery, about 25 strong, under Lieutenant L. J. Phillips, about 50 yards from the house. I personally cautioned the pickets, and instructed the men how to act in the event of an attack. I took my place for the night with the men of Company I. Lieutenants Phillips and Orr, of the same company, were sleeping with their men by a log where there had been a fire. I cautioned the men against making a fire.

Shortly after it commenced raining and became very dark, the darkness and rain continuing without intermission all night. Having awakened about 3 o'clock in the morning, I held some conversation with Lieutenant Phillips, and then laid down again, with my head resting on the root of a tree. I had been in this position only about five minutes, when a man within a few feet of me demanded of me to surrender the entire command. I answered negatively, in rather rough language, upon which he immediately fired on me with a shotgun. I returned the fire with my revolver. At this the men sprang up with their arms, when the guerrillas, to the number of about 100, opened on us with shotguns and pistols, and as they were within 5 or 10 feet of us, we had no alternative but to fight, notwithstanding the great disadvantages under which we labored. The fight lasted some five minutes, when the rebels commenced to retreat. I then ordered my men to fall back to the house, after which the rebels came up and carried off their dead and wounded. I also removed mine to the house. I felt that as it was impossible to see 5 feet it would be folly for me to pursue them in the woods, and also felt confident that they would renew the attack at daybreak, but in this I was disappointed. I then buried Lieutenant Phillips, who was killed after being shot down three times, and left Sergeant Handy, who was mortally wounded, in the hands, of the women of the house, who promised to bury him. I then started to join Captain Montgomery, carrying my wounded on litters. The road lay through a very bad swamp for about 6 miles, yet the men cheerfully bore the fatigue of carrying their wounded comrades, and think that it was the most laborious march I ever made. After proceeding in this way some 6 miles, I found some teams and pressed them to convey the wounded. Inclosed I send a list* of the killed and wounded. Of the loss of the enemy I can form no correct estimate. The ground was covered with blood, and a large number of guns and pistols were picked up in the morning.

I was joined by Captain Montgomery, with his command, on the evening of the 7th, and on the morning of the 8th we marched to a point a few miles above Barfield's Point, where we embarked on the steamer Darling, arriving at this post about 11 p. m., on the 8th. The wounded have been well cared for, and will in all probability recover. Captain Montgomery's command while detached had no general engagement; he lost no men either killed or wounded, but killed some 6 or 7 guerrillas.

I cannot speak too highly of the energy and perseverance of the men of my command, displayed on this fatiguing march, nor of the desperate courage with which they met and repelled a fierce night attack made by overwhelming numbers of confident desperadoes. The question may occur as how they managed to elude the pickets. This can only be answered by the fact that they were thoroughly
