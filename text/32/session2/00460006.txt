Mr. FAULKNER stated that Mr. SHER'ftAfep
Ci.f.mens, the member elect from the Fifteenth
Congressional district of the State of Virginia, to
fill the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of
the Hon. George W. Thompson, was present
with his credentials, and ready to qualify.
Mr. EWING also introduced Mr. 'VV'illiam
Preston, member elect of the Seventh Congres-
sional district of the State of Kentucky, to fill the
vacancy occasioned by the resignation of the
Hon. Humphrey Marshall, and asked that he
be qualified.
These gentlemen presented themselves at the
bar, and were qualified by the Speaker adminis-
tering to them the usual oath to support the Con-
stitution of the United States.
On motion by Mr. JONES, ofTennessee.it
was
Ordered, That a message be sent to the Senate, inform-
ing that body that there is a quorum of the House present,
and that the House is ready to proceed to business.
Mi!. JONES also offered the following resolu-
tion; which was read and agreed to:
Resolved, That a committee be appointed on the part of
the House, to join such committee as may be appointed on
the part of the Senate, to wait on the President of the
United States, and to inform him that a quorum of the two
Houses is assembled, and that Congress is now ready to
leeeive any communication lie may be pleased to make.
The following gentlemen were appointed by the
Speaker to constitute the said committee on the
part of the House: Messrs Jones, of Tennessee,
Haven, and Robbins.
CHOOSING SEATS.
Mr. SUTHERLAND offered the following
resolution, and upon it moved the previous ques-
tion :
Resolved, That the Clerk of this House, immediately tit-
ter the passage of this resolution, place in a box the name
of eaeh member and delegate of the House of Representa
lives, on a separate piece of paper; that he then proceed,
in the presence of the House, to draw trom said box, one
at a time, the said pieces of paper; and as each is drawn
■he shall announce the name of the member or delegate
upon it. who idiall then choose his seat for the present ses-
sion : Provided, That before said drawing shall commence,
the Speaker shall cause every seat to be vacated, and shall
see that every seat continues vacant until it is selected un-
der this order.
Mr. FREEMAN Moved to lay the resolution
upon the table.
Tiie House was divided upon the latter motion,
and there were—ayes 47, noes not counted.
So the House refused to lay the resolution upon
the table.
Air. GORMAN. I ask the gentleman from
New York [Mr. Sutherland] to withdraw his
call for the previous question., and to postpone
action upon the resolution until Wednesday neXt. •
[Cries of" No!" "No!" all over the House.] I
The demand for the previous question was then
seconded, and the main question ordeied to be
put.
The question was then put, and the resolution
was agreed to.
Mr. 13R1GGS moved to reconsider the vote by
which the resolution was adopted, and to lay the
motion to reconsider upon the table; which latter
motion was agreed to.
The SPEAKER. It is made the duty of the
Speaker, under the resolution just passed, to see
that no gentleman takes a seat until he has regu-
arly drawn it. It is proposed that, by unani-
mous consent, the members agree to pass without
the bar, and return as their names shall be drawn.
[Cries of "Good!" "Good!" "Agreed!"
" Agreed
The SPEAKER. That will then be considered
as the order of proceeding under the resolution.
On motion of Mr. PHELPS, by unanimous
consent it was
Orderel, That John F. Darby be permitted to continue
in his seat during the drawing under tiie resolution.
Mr. BRIGGS asked the unanimous consent of
the House that a colleague of Mr. Wm. Ap1>le-
ton, of Massachusetts, who was yesterday called
home on account of illness in his family, be per-
mitted to draw a seat for him.
Objection was made, and the motion was not
agreed to.
Mr. THOMAS M. HOWE asked the sattie
faVor in behalf of Mr. Allison, of Pennsylvania,
who was confined to his bed by sickness.
Objected to.
The members then all vacated their seats, and
retired without the bar of the House.
The drawing then commenced; and was pro-
ceeded in to completion, occupying about an hour
and a half.
A message was here received from the Senate,
by the hands of Asbury Dickins, Eriq., its Secre-
tary, informing the House that the Senate had
passed a resolution to appoint a committee to meet
1 the committee appoint^ on the part of the House
of Representatives, to wait upon the President of
the United States and inform him that a quorum
of the two Houses had assembled, and that Con-
gress was ready to receive any communication he
miifht be pleased to make; and that the Senate
had appointed Messrs. Bright and Davis as such
committee on their part.
HOUR OF MEETING.
Mr. RICHARDSON. 1 would inquire if the
rules adopted fit the last session extend to this ?
The SPEAKER. They extend to the entire
Congress.
Mr. RICHARDSON. Including the hour of
meeting?
The SPEAKER. The hour of meeting is in-
cluded.
Mr. RICHARDSON. I move, then, that, until
otherwise ordered, the hour of meeting of the
House be twelve o'clock, m.
Mr. SKELTON. I move to amend the motion
by inserting eleven o'clock, in the place of twewe
0 clock.
The question was first taken on the amendment,
and it was not agreed to.
The question then recurring on the original mo-
tion, it was put and carried in the affirmative.
UNFINISHED BUSINESS.
Mr. STUART. It will be recollected, that when
the last session closed almost the entire business of
Congress was left upon the Speaker's table. I de-
sire thus early to submit a proposition to the
Hoyse, that after one hour being spent in the call-
ing of committees, the House will proceed to the
business upon the Speaker's table as the special
order, and consider it until it is referred to the ap-
propriate committees, or otherwise disposed of. I ,
deem such a course highly important to the inter-
ests of the country.
The SPEAKER The gentleman will please
submit his motion in writing.
Mr. CLINGMAN. I wish it understood that
1 shall object to the motion of the gentleman.
Mr. STUART. If it be necessary to effect the
object, I ask a suspension of the rules.
The motion having been reduced to writing, was
' read, as follows:
J Resolved, That after the expirttioli of the lrtorning hour
p. ch day the House shall proceed *o the consideration of
1 the business u(lon the Speaker's table for one hour, unul all
business thereon shall be appropriately referred or otherwise
j disposed of.
Mr. CLINGMAN. I beg leave to inquire of
the Chair .whether, under the existing orders of
the House, it is not competent for a majority, every
day, after the expiration of the morning hour, to
proceed to the business upon the Speaker's table?
The SPEAKER. By motion it is.
Mr. CLINGMAN. Then I do not think it is
necessary to make this business a special order.
Mr. CARTTER. Is it in order to move to lay
the resolution upon the table?
The SPEAKER. The resolution is not before
the House. The pending question is upon the
suspension of the rules for its introduction.
The question was then taken on the motion to
suspend the rules, and it was not agreed to.
DIVISION OF OREGON TERRITORY.
Mr. LANE asked the unanimous consent of
, the House to introduce the foltowing resolution:
1 Resolved, That the Committee ort Terri tories be requested
, to inquire intoThe expediency of dividing Oregon Territory,
and forming a new Territory north of the Columbia river,
, by the name of Columbia Territory, with leave to report by
< bill or otherwise.
Mr. GOODENOW. I object.
Mr. LANE. I move to suspend the rules for
the purpose of introducing the resolution.
The question was taken, and the rules were sus-
! pended.
j The resolution, as above inserted, was then in-
| troduced, and adopted.
] PRICE OF THE PUBLIC LANDS.
Mr. COBB. I hone it "will be the pleasure of
the House to take up House bill No. 74, proposing
to reduce the price of the public lands to actual
settlers and cultivators of the soil, attd make it the
sp'ecial order for the first Tuesday in January. I
make that motion.
Mr. SEYMOUR, of New York. 1 object.
Mr. COBB. Then I move to suspend the rilles
fot- the purpose of introducing the proposition.
The question was then taken ort the Tatter mo-
tion, aiid it Was not agreed to.
