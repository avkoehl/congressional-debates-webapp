The troops are all on the march to-day for their new positions.

I shall leave for Culpeper to-morrow.

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., August 6, 1862.

Major-General POPE, Sperryville, Va.:

There is but a single and very small regiment of cavalry here, which is required for provost-marshal duty. If you have any other to replace King's, do so. The batteries were unfit for service, but two will be made effective and sent to Burnside. You must not leave this command without these arms till we can send him others.

General-in-Chief.

WASHINGTON, D. C., August 6, 1862.

Major-General POPE, Sperryville, Va.:

The Secretary of War decides that, under the existing organization and regulation of the Pay Department, paymasters cannot be assigned as you desire. The route you propose for General Cox is too much exposed. Select one more in rear, if possible, and telegraph me. I will take the matter up at the earliest moment I can. The Secretary of War is of opinion that the sending beyond your lines of citizens who do not take the oath of allegiance should be the exception, not the general rule.

There are already sixteen signal officers with the Army of Virginia; eight with General McDowell, and eight with General Banks. Detail one of them for your headquarters.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

Major-General HALLECK:

I cannot suggest any other routes for General Cox than those mentioned, without his retiring far to the rear of his present position. The roads I suggested are turnpikes. The maintain roads other than these are bad and difficult, and would delay his movements too much to render him of any service. His move on Lexington would necessitate the withdrawal of forces from Richmond and still further disperse the army at that place. Even should the worst happen, General Cox could fall back upon his present position, after having considerably weakened the force at Richmond.
