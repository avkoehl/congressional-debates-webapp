troops after dark in wooded countries, I suggested to General Butler the following: To station cavalry vedettes from Hancock's camp all the way to Deep Bottom; these cavalry vedettes to light fires at dark and keep them burning until the whole column had passed. All this was done. The two roads were so brightly lit up that I feared the fires would be seen by the enemy. In addition I muffled both bridges over the James with hay. Is this accusation the reward for my extraordinary care and precaution? A blind man could have found the way by the heat of the fire. If this charge has gone to Lieutenant-General Grant I want it refuted and this shown him.

Lieutenant-Colonel COMSTOCK,

City Point:

After thinking over the matter, and firmly believing that charge to be unfounded, I must, in justice to myself, insist upon it that an officer be ordered from your headquarters to ride over and inspect that road before I touch it.

Your note received. All right. General Butler and I both thought so. Your dispatch was unfortunately worded.
