General WILLCOX,

Commanding Division.

Have you any further information of the enemy's advancing a line of battle? What news have you from Harriman? Where is his skirmish line, and is the skirmish line up with that of the enemy? I do not wish to move out Ferrero's men until there is a pressing necessity. Do you think this exists?

Yours, &amp; c.,

JNumbers G. PARKE,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

The signal officer reports 10.30 that the enemy do not appear to anticipate any demonstration on our part: They are burning brush on their line and clearing up. Save this, everything is quiet. No working parties visible. The travel on the telegraph road is the same as ordinary.

O. B. W[ILLCOX].
