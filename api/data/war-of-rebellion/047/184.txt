SUMTER, July 9, 1863.

Captain W. F. NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Unless you get other instructions, send the first battalion that comes (probably Nelson's) to Morris Island.

R. S. RIPLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 9, 1863.

Hon CHARLES MACBETH,

Mayor of Charleston:

SIR: The papers herewith* will show you that an attack is impending on the Morris Island outworks; so to the defense of the city. An indispensable battery, in case of an attack by land on that island, remains unfinished, adequate labor not having been supplied by the State authorities. Cannot labor be furnished in the emergency from the class of free negroes in this city, as on occasion in Virginia, and also from the slaves of the vicinage? Material results may be achieved, even at this late hour, by the application of a sufficient labor force energetically handled.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., July 9, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel D. B. HARRIS,

Chief Engineer, &amp;c.:

COLONEL: The commanding general directs me to call your attention to the urgent necessity for immediately obstructing this harbor, to every possible extent, with rope contrivances for that purpose, as already directed, both verbally and in writing. He wishes Major Echols and yourself to give your special attention to this work, and to the multiplication of this style of obstructions by every possible means.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., July 9, 1863.

Major HUTSON LEE,

Chief Quartermaster, &c.:

MAJOR: The commanding general directs that you have held in readiness, at Pocotaligo and Adams Run, transportation to bring 600 men from the former and 500 from the latter place to this city at once. The trains will be furnished the commanding officers of the Second and Third Districts with as little delay as possible.

I have the honor to be, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN F. O'BRIEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
