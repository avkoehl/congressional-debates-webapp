McPHERSON'S, January 1, 1863.

Major-General GRANT:

Would it not be well to move Colonel Leggett's brigade to this side of the Tallahatchie? There is nothing left at Abbeville, and the rebel fortifications on the south side have been leveled down by the contrabands. The bridges can be guarded from this side and I can keep a good force of cavalry at Abbeville to scour the country. The road across the bottom is very bad, making communication somewhat difficult.

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.

McPHERSON'S, January 1, 1863.

Major-General GRANT:

Cavalry scouts just in and confirm report that Van Dorn is this side of Coffeeville with part of his cavalry force.

I will come up to-morrow, leaving here at 7 o'clock.

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.

HOLLY SPRINGS, MISS., January 1, 1863.

Major General J. B. McPHERSON, Abbeville, Miss.:

I have just heard most reliably from all south of us. There are but about 8,000 troops at Grenada. Van Dorn is about Coffeeville with the cavalry. Very few troops at Jackson; all have gone to Vicksburg. Kirby Smith's forces have gone and are on the road. Banks has superseded Butler. I wish you could come here to-morrow. I will not be able to go down.

You will at once stop all fortifying and intrenching of your present positions, and without noise have everything pertaining to your brigade loaded, packed, and moved back to the boats. Each regiment will embark, if practicable, upon the same boats upon which they came.

Let one regiment do picket duty until 4 a.m. to-morrow, when they also will return to the landing. Let wagons gather up all the tools. You will please notify the Chicago batteries, A and B, also Hart's battery and the 30-pounder Parrotts, that they may be in in time. All this must be done without noise or sign.

By order of Brigadier General A. J. Smith:
