attention of Congress, and I hope will meet with
favor As any plan for the government of the
western tribes of Indians contemplates an interior
police of their own in each community, and that
then own laws shall prevail, as between them-
selves, for which some of their treaties provide,
this, as it seems to me, indispensable step to their
advancement in civilization, cannot be taken with-
out their own consent Unless some system is
marked out by which there shall be a separate
allotment of land to each individual whom the
scheme shall entitle to it, you will look in vain for
any general casting off ot savageism. Common
property and civilization cannot coexist The
few instances to be found m the United States and
other countries of small abstracted communities,
who diaw their subsistence and whatever com-
forts they have from a common store, do not mil-
itate against this position Under a show of
equality, the masa work for two or three rulers
or directors, who enjoy what they will, and dis
tribute what they please The members nevei
rise beyond a certain point, (to which they had
reached,generally, before theyjomed thesociety,)
and never will while they remain where they aie
But if they should, these associations aie so small
and confined as to place their possessions in the
class of individual estates At the foundation of
the whole social system lies individuality of piop
erty It is, perhaps, nine times in ten the stim-
ulus that manhood first feels It has produced
the energy, industry, and enteiprise that distin-
guish the civilized vvoild, and contributes moie
largely to the good mótala of men than those
are willing to acknowledge who have not looked
somewhat closely at their fellow beings With j
it come all the delights tin t the home ex- I
presses, the comforts that follow fixed settle-
ments are in its tram, and to them belongs not
only an anxiety to do light, that those giatifiea-
uons may not be forfeited, but by industry, that
they may be increased Social mtercouise, and a
just appreciation of its pleasuies lesult, when you
have civilised, and, tor the most part, moial men
This process, it btrikes me, the Indians must go
through befoie then habits can be mtueiuilly
changed, and they may, attei what many of them
have seen and know, do it veiy upidly If, on
the other hand, the luge tiatts ot land set aptut
for them shall tonttnue to be joint pioperty, the
oidinary motive to industry (and the most powei
tul one) will be wanting A bale subsistence is
as much as they can piomise themselves A lew
acres of badly cultivated coin about then cabins
will be seen, instead ot extensive lields, nch pas-
tuies, and valuable suxk The lattei belong to
him. who is conscious that whit he plows u> his
own, and will descend to those he loves, nevei to
the man who docs not know by what teniae he
holds his miserable dwelling Laziness and un
thrift will beso gen ei al as not to be disgiaceful,
and if the produce of their labors should betluown
into common stock, the indolent and dishonest
will subsist at the expense ol the mentoiious
Besides, there is a strong motive in reference to
ouiselves for encouraging individual owneiship
The history of the world pi oves that distinct and
separate possessions make those who hold them
aveise to change The risk of losing the advant
ages they have, men do not readily encountei
By adopting and acting on the view suggested, a
large body will be created, whose interest would
dispose them to keep things steady They would
be the ballast of the ship
Plans have at various times been proposed for a
confederation of the Indian tribes west ot the Mis-
sissippi, embracing those who shall hereafter re
move     1 incline much to doubt the expedience of
such a measure    It could only be executed with
the consent of the tribes that might become mem-
bers of it   The Choctaws have twice signified their
disinclination to it   1 he treaty with the Chei okees
of December, 1835, discourages it    The idea of
such a bond between dependent communities is I
new    The league could only be for regulation
among themselves, and not for mutual protec- |
tion, which is the usual object of such combina- I
lions    They have no common property to seeure,
or common interest to advance    Any plan I have
seen is based upon the power of the Piesident to
reject their articles of association, which exhibits
strikingly their true position   They may be likened
to colonies, among whom a confederation  does
not exist     They are governed, and their legisla-
tion, by each community for itself, is supervised
and controlled by the parent country   When they
contemplate a different attituae, they confederate
A general council of the Indians might pa's resolu-
tions of a pacific character, oi to arrest actual hos
tihties, and to regulate their intercourse with each
other, but this could be done better by Congiess,
leaving to each tribe the management of its own
internal concerns, not interfering with treaties or
laws    There are inherent difficulties in the dis
similar conditions of the tribes     Some of them are
semi civilized, others as wild as the game they
i hunt     Some are rich, others poor     Some num-
1 ber but a few hundred  souls, others more thou
sands     We cannot frame for  them, much less
could they do it, articles of confederation which
i would bring into council a just representation of
I the difTeient tribes     If you allot so many repre
sentatives to a tribe, looking to its popul ition, the
smallei would be swallowed up in the larger     If
you limit to a certain number, oi within or be-
tween two numbeis, you aie unjust to the larger
tubes, which  a. combination of the smillei, \/i h
fewer motives to rectitude, might contiol   A small
piopoition of all might come into the confederation,
and these sepaiatecl fiom each othei by bands who
would not join in the anangement, and would not
on any pnnuple be bound by the íesohes of the
geneial council     We owe  duties   to  ourselves
Cogent leasons for not giving to these neighboring
communities more concentiation than they have, !
must be seen     While they aie treated with all,
kindness, tenderness even, and liberality, pruden-
tial considerations would seem to requne that they
should   be   kept distinct from   each  other     Let .
them manage their internal police after then  own |
views   One oi moie superintendents,and as mi>ny
agencies as may be deemed propei, with such reg
ulation of then intercourse with each other, ai d
such guaids for then protedon, as Congiess shall
think  fit  to pie cube, would, it appeals to me,
meeu the emei¿ency     Through the ofiiceis thus
stationed among them they could make their com   j
plaints known   and as|c   íediess foi   grievances,
vvhii h would be affoided when it was proper     It
is   not understood   that   the   dehber itions of the
council could lesult m any act  which would be |
valid   until approved  by the  Cliff  Migistrate, |
winch does not lessen the force ol what ht*s been I
siid                                                                                [
It would pei haps be judicious not to pay acorn- |
phment at some hazard, especially where it would \
not be appiectated, but to asseit directly for gen-
eral pui poses the authority which actually exists, i
and which must, upon any suggestion that may I
be adopted, be really felt and acknowledged      At
some futuie period, if circumstances should be so
changed  as  to call foi a territorial government,
or foi  any othei  alteiation  in  the system,  the

The general correctness and punctuality with
which the office!s of the Department, as well as
those of the une of the army acting m the De-
partment haveheietofore rentleied their accounts,
justifies the belief that the several balances in then
hands will, in due time, be satispactonly accounted
for
The assignment to the Topographical Depart-
ment of the duties connected with surveying and
opening the seveial roads authorized by Congress,
(except such as are strictly of a military char-
acter,) which have hitherto devolved upon the
Quartermaster's Department, enables me to con-
fine my íemarks relative to this branch of the
public sdvice to the operations connected with
the " western fiontier military road "
Measuies were taken, early in the season, for
completin-r the suiveys and for opening portions
of this road, which was, with the view of facili-
tatm<*operations, divided into three sections That
part of it commencing at Fort Towson, its south
ern extremity, and extending to Fort Smith, con-
stituting the southern, fiom Fort Smith to Fort
Leavenworth, the middle, and from the last-men-
tioned point to Fort Snellmg, at the mouth of the
Saint Peters, the northern section
The suiveys of the middle section were com-
pleted in the autumn of last yeai, and that part of
it extending from Fort Leavenworth south, to the
MaraisdeCjgne, has been put under contract,and
the work of opening and grading has been com-
menced bv the contractas
From the commissioners appointed to locate the
other sections, final repotts have not yet been íe-
ceived No doubt, however, is entertained that
the work intrusted to them will be completed before
the close of the present season
The site selected for the new military post to be
established near old Fort Smith, on the Aikansas,
has been purchased, agreeably to a íesolution of
