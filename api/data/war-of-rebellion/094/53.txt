Send scouts to the front, toward Pound and stony Gaps, and hazard, to learn all they can about a force reported coming in that way; direct them to go as far as possible. Report the receipt of this order and what they learn. Press horses, if necessary, to mount men, and report how many men you can mount armed.

LEXINGTON, December 4, 1864.

Brigadier General HUGH EWING,

Louisville, Ky.:

Dr. J. M. Bailey, Twenty-sixth Kentucky, telegraphs from Bowling Green that the Twenty-sixth leaves there to-day, and the rebels will take possession of the place as soon as the regiment leaves. No troops can be sent from General McLean's command to you at present. Is there not sufficient of the twelfth [U. S. Colored] Heavy Artillery at Bowling Green to protect the place?

Respectfully,

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
