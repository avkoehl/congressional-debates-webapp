HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF HUMBOLDT,Fort Humboldt, Cal., June 30, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel R. C. DRUM, U. S. Army,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Dept. of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:

COLONEL: From the diferrend reports of Lieutenant Colonel S. G. Whipple, First Battalion Mountaineers, California Volunteers, commanding Fort Gaston, Cal., received since I left Hoopa Valley, all of which have been forwarded to department headquarters, you will perceive that he has succeeded, and credit is due him for the same, in getting nearly all the Indians to come into his post. The rest are also expected to come in very soon; that is to say, all those who are well armed and who have been a terror to the people in the district. They say that they want peace and are tired of fighting. The activity, energy, and zeal displayed by different scouting parites form the commands of Major Wright and Captain Buckley, Sixth Infantry California Volunteers, have in y opinion aided very materially in accomplishng the above result, and equal credit is due them for same. The reports of all scouts I have sent you in order that the department commander may know to whom credit is due. all or nearly all of the provisions of these Indians have been destroyed by scouts, besides killing a number of Indians, consequently they have to be fed to some extent, which is being done at Fort Gaston with as little expense as possible; all of which I fully believe is most economical for the Government, and that the department commander is with me I have not a doubt, for it is well known that they can be subsisted cheaper than we can possibly fight them. Now the question comes up, what shall be done with them? From the wellknown treachery of their race, little or no confidence can be placed in what they say, nor can we tell how long this peace will continue. Shall all of them be seized to avoid further trouble? If so, the head men must be sent down to San Francisco Harbor as soon as sbackbone of the Indian troubles in this district will be broken, and I would most respectfully request in that case that you give me authority to send down such numbers of them as is deemed best for the interest of the Government. The early consideration of the foregoing and instructions of the department commander is most earnestly requested.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. M. BLACK,

Colonel Sixth Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding.
