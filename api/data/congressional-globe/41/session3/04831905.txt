colleague and to the House whether, in view of
the fact that all the people of the country are
familiar with the national bank notes, it is
wise to change the impressions of those notes
on the slightest occasion or unless the very best
reasons can be given for it, and whether or not
such a chango will not tend to confuse the
minds and judgments of the people and lead to
their taking counterfeits ?
Mr. GAKFIELD, of Ohio. The Secretary
of the Treasury has recommended to the com-
mittee in several letters which I hold in my
hand, and which I will incorporate in my re-
marks, as well as in hia annual report, that
the counterfeiting of the national bank notes
has gone on to a very dangerous extent.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I do not
object to debate upon this question, but I do
not want it to be all on one side.
Mr. GA.RFIBLD, of Ohio. I am merely
answering a question put to me by a gentleman
on the other side of this question. At present
there is no method by which the national banks
are required to return worn and mutilated notes
to the bank of issue for exchange. This bill
will compel them to do so, and it will compel
them also to stamp or cut across the face of
every counterfeit note that comes into their
hands the word "counterfeit" for the protec-
tion of the people.
Mr. McGREW. I desire to make a parlia-
mentary inquiry. Is it in order to move to
lay the bill on the table ?
The SPEAKER. Jtisnot. The bill is not
yet before the House. The motion is to sus-
pend the rules and take it up.
Mr. McGREW. Well, I think it ought to
be laid on the table.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I wish to state
that in the days of State banks nearly all the
States had such a law as this in relation to
stamping counterfeit notes; but we have no
such law in regard to the national banks, and
the result is that a vast number of counterfeit
bills are afloat in the country, and no one is
under any obligation to arrest their circulation
in the manner provided for in this bill.
Mr. POTTER. Does not this bill call for
the engraving of national bank notes at Wash-
ington ?
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. It does, under
the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury.
Mr. POTTER. It will be time enough to
make a bureau when there is a building for it.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. Seventy thou-
sand dollars were appropriated in a bill passed
the other day for renewing these notes, and
there is no appropriation asked for in this bill.
A larger appropriation will be required by-and-
by. If we go on as we are doing now it will
not be long before the national bank currency
will be reduced to a mass of rags and filth.
Mr. STEVENSON. Then we will wipe out
the whole system.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. This bill will
save half the cost of printing these notes,
besides the large amount now paid for ex-
pressage, to transport these bills from the office
of the bank note companies in New York to
this city. I regret that there is not time to
discuss this, bill which had the careful consid-
eration of the Committee on Banking and Cur-
rency, and which has passed the Senate in the
exact form, and was finally drafted and agreed
upon in the Committee on Banking and Cur-
rency. I submit the letter of the Secretary of
the Treasury, and the accompanying papers,
and will then call .for a vote.
The letters are as follows :
KEASUBY DBPAETMEST,
Office of the Secretaby,
January 1-1, 1871.
Sir: I inclose an estimate made by the Comptrol-
ler ot the Currency for the preparation of plates
and the printing of national bank notes for all the
national banks of the country, of the denominations
of ten dollars and twenty doliai*. Xhc cost is put
at&520,47o; and it may bo considered, X think, a fair
estimate.
In my last annual report I recommended the re-
newal of the national bank note circulation. Every
day's experience strengthens the opinion I then
41sx Cong. 3d Sess.—No. 120.
expressed, that the work ought to he undertaken
at once.
Upon conference with the Comptroller of the Cur-
rency, X became satisfied that it was not wise to at-
tempt the reissue of every denomination; and we
have therefore selected the two Upon which the
most dangerous counterfeits are known to be in cir-
culation.
I have the honor to advise an appropriation for
the amount specified.
Very respectfully,
GEO. S. BOUTWELL,
Secretary.
Hon James A, Garfield. Chairman Committee on
Banking, &c.t House of Representative.
Treasury Department,
Offick of Comptroller of the Currency,
"Washington, January 14; 1871.
Sir: I have caused^ careful estimate to be pre-
pared of the cost of renewing the denominations
'tens" and •'twenties," national bank notes, with
the following results:
Thero are 16S3 plates containing these denomina-
tions in various combinations, which, at a cost of
$200 each, which is the contract price, would re-
quire....... $336,600
Printing $125,000,000, which would require
2,850,000 impressions, at $57 50 per thou-
sand  163,875
Paper, 1,500,000 shoots, at i?10 per thousand  15,000
Original engraving, dies, &o    5,000
Total   $520,475
Respectfully submitted:
IL R. HULBURD,
Comptroller.
Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell, Secretary of the Treasury.
Treasury Department,
Office of the Secretary,
January 25,1871.
Sir: I have the honor to transmit a copy of a com-
munication made to me by Mr. McCartoe, chief of
the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, under date
oftho 23d instant, showingthecostofprcparingplat.es
and printing national bank notes of the denomina-
tion of ten, twenty, and hfty dollars each, and of
each denomination a number equal to the number
issued of such denomination for all the national
banks oftho country to the present time.
From this estimate it appears that if one impression
bo made by the New York bank-note companies and
the rest of the work be done at the Bureau of Engrav-
ing and Printing, the cost will be $445,599 75.
If the work bo done exclusively by the b ank-noto
companies at the rates heretofore paid to those com-
panies for printing the national bank notes, the cost
will be $047,900; and should the work be done ex-
clusively at the bureau in this Department the cost
Will be 1383,088 75.
I have reason to suppose that the contracts made
some time since with the bank-note companies are
higher than we should be under the necessity of
making at the present time; but the work can no
doubt bedone cheaper at the bureau than elsewhore
for many reasons, the chief of which are that there
is no interest charged on the capital invested, and
no expense incurred for rent, water-tax, insurance,
or profit to proprietors.
Should the appropriation bo made, as I trust will
bo the case, I respectfully advise that the Secretary
of the Treasury bo left free to make such arrange-
ments for the work as may be deemed expedient,
My own opinion is that one impression only should
be made by the bank-note companion, as a check, and
that the rest of the work should bo done in the
bureau, the saving cffectcd by doing all the work
here, in my opinion, being of very little importance
as compared with the security of making one of the
bank-note companies and the bureau checks mutu-
ally upon each other.
1 ought perhaps to mention that the estimate for
doing the work by the bank-note companies includes
the impress of the seal, which by law is placed upon
the notes in the Treasury Department.

Secretary.

Very respectfully,
GEO. B. McCARTEE,
Chief of Bureau Engraving and Printing*
Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
Secretary of the Treasury.
Trtc \sttry Department,
Office of the Secretary,
January 30,1871.
Sir : In the course of my dutios in the Treasury
Department, I have boon called frequently to con-
sider the topics to which you invite my attention in
yourcommunication of this date; and I have no doubt
of the practicability and safety of printing United
States notes, bonds, and securities of every kind,
including stamps and national bank notes, at Wash-
ington, under the immediato control of the Secretary
of the Treasury, subject to the condition that a new
building be erected and a superintendent of print-
ing in that building be appointed who shall be offi-
cially and practically separated from the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing asnow established under the
roof of the Treasury building.
The statements already furnished to your commit-
tee and to the Committee on Appropriations, by Mr.
McCartee, show that the cost of printing will be
very much less at the Treasury Department than the
amounts now paid to the bank note companies in
New York and Philadelphia. In this statement I
have not considered certain expenses, such as rent,
insurance, taxes, interest on capital, &e., which must
be regarded by corporations or individuals engaged
in similar business. I ought not, in this connection,
to omit to call the attention of the committee to the
fact that the bank note companies have had largo
orders and contracts from the Treasury Department
during the last ten years, and that their means of
doing business havo reference to the continuance of
these orders and contracts. While there isnosubsist-
ing legal obligation which cannot be complied with
during the next six months, or at any rate within the
time necessary for the construction of a proper build-
ing, it is to be assumed that these companies would
make vigorous opposition to the transfer of the busi-
ness to Washington. AH the work of the Depart-
ment can be done here without practical difficulty,
and at the prime cost, with the exception perhaps of
the adhesive stamps, it being doubtful whether they
can be prepared here, as the climate is more unfavor-
able than a colder climate for the performance of the
work in a proper manner.
Should the committee decide to roport a bill for tho
erection of a separate building, the clearest language
should be used to secure the complete separation of
the work that maybe done in tho new building from
that which may be done in the Treasury building
Very respectfully, GEO. S. BOUTWEIX,
Secretary.
Hon. James A. Garfield, Chairman Committee on
Banking, &c., House of Representatives.
A schedule of national surrcncynotes, a partof which-
with the plates, have been captured by the secret service.
$500 national currency:
$500 reverse for green and black printing; a very
dangerous counterfeit.
SlOOnational currency: . .
M00—The Ohio National Bank of Cincinnati.
&J00—The First National Bank ef Boston.
These notes are finely executed, and the plates are
so engraved that they can be altered by changing the
title to any national bank in the country.
S'50 national currency: , .
$50—Reverse plate, embarkation of the Pilgrims.
