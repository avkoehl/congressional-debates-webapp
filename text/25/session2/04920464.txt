Mr MOTJTON mo; ed that the billa relating to

Friday, many of w hich, he «aid, it was right should
be acted on at c nee
Mr KNIGHT did not know what there wis in
tVse bills to entitle them to preferi_nc° Why
not let them take their places on the calendirl
Mr MOUT<">N said he would not have asked 10
have taken them up, were he not convinced that
they would not consum  the time of the Senate
The most of them were ver) plain cases, not in-
volving anj pi inciple likely to lead to discussion,
but, at the same tune, were highly interesting to a
lanre portion of the community
Mr BENTON would inform the Senate that it
was not a private bill which the Senator from
Louisiana asked to be considered on Friday, but
a whole clas~ of bills, some ot which hid been be-
fore the country for the last thirty-four years m
ene shape or other, and he desired to have them
taken up m that da}
Mr TIPTON expressed his unwillingness to op-
po ethe motion, but it Senptors were to be miulged
in tikmg 1 ills on of t le legular order, the} woul 1
all be held to clum precedence He was opp sed
to this mode of ¡ roceeding, unless for some v^ry
tpecia] reason
Mr NORVELL expressed his w ish that the
Senator from Loui tana should bp gratified in
having those b lis taken up on the day named
The qjestion was then taken and agreed to
Tne bill relating to the Orphans' Court of the
ounty of Al-xandria, in the District of Columbia,
was read a thud tim¿, and pissed
Mr GRUNDY said theie w is a bi i 1 u t on the ta-
ble } esterday, at the suggestion c £ tne Senator frrim
Kentucky, m relation to the abolishment of ímpu-
sonrneat for debt in certain cases Mr G ex-
pressed himself as favourable to the bill, and said
that if it were to be parsed this session it could not
be acted on too speedily, and he, therefore, moved
to take it up
The question was on the amendment, viz making
the matter correspond with those States where the
said abolition of imprisonment had m whole or in
part been abolished
Mr PRESTON opposed the amendment at some
length He thought its action would not be equal.
He wished legislation to be on one broad, general,
and uniform principle, not partial in its operation.
He was opposed to the amendment for that reason,
asd he was also opposed to the whole principle of
the bill He thought we were getting wise and hu-
mane beyond the experience of the age, and if such
a bill were passed, it would be doing a manifest in-
jury to the creditor He desired gentlemen to look
to the consequences likely to flow from such a sys-
tem, and pause before they lent it their sanction
He would not give his vote for any bill advocating
such a measure, and more especially one with such
an amendment
Mr TALLMADGE would not go into a discus-
sion of the general merits of this bill The time
of the Senate was too precious, at this juncture, to
be taken up with protracted discussions of subjects
on which the mind of every Senator was made up
He would ask the Senator from South Carolina if
he was prepared to say that citizens travelling from
different parts of the United States to that commer-
cial emporium, New York, should be arrested and
imprisoned for debt, as felons, thioufh a process
of the Unite 1 States courts, when the State ot New
York herself hid abolished the whole odious sys
tern? Yes, siid Mr T the ¡jrand jurj hid alrtudy
presented the cases of twenty three oitirens, mcar-
caicerated in the prison cf New Yoik, who were-
among strangers, and unable to procure bail
Mr BAYARD felt disponed to vote against ths
bill, because he conceived it useless legislation
The laws of the United States already provided for
the cases of insolvents If a man had property,
he had to surrender that property, or, if he were
viihout property, all he had to do was to present
himself to the district judge, make oath of his ina-
bility in proper form, and the judge would giant
him a certificate of discharge
He took it for granted that no Senator would be
w tiling to confine a man, who was un ible to pay
his debts—shut him up m prison until he was able
But if the law were dispensed with, the worst con
sequences would follow, and innumerable tnuds
tike place under its piovisions There were spe-
cies of property which could not he reached in any
other way, than bv retiming the laws of imprison-
ment for debt A man might hive ten times the
amount he owed in his pocitet, and liHgh at his
creditors It was necessary to compel som  per-
sons to I e honest oi, at least, to guard the hone t
creditor from fiaud
Mr NORVELL sud that the thanks of die
country were due to the Senatoi Irom New York,
[Mr Taiiaudof,] lor bringing fonvardthis bill,
and he only regretted that the measure did not pre-
cede, instead of following State legislation upon
this important «ubject He was sorry that it did
not extend to States in which imprisonment for
debt had not heen abolished, as w 11 as to States
which had abolished it The principle of imprison-
ment for debt was a remnant ot baibarism, un-
woithy of th  country an 3 of tbea> It ought
not, for one moment, u> be suffeie I to dishonor
our statute books It iin^ been s.n i h\tth  bill
would give rise to frat ds Sir, hi' lh( abolition
of impusonnent f >r dfbt m Ketitncki, meif ised
the amount of frvnl m tint Sute Hid it nrl
diminished ltf We'f not debts moie isily collected,
was not the whole busings r f ti i St i n i bettor
condition, had not a more nice <- nsp of himrr b^'n
introduced into the transactions between mm and
man, since Kentucky had erased from h< roo le the
barbarous principle in question, thin n d been he
case before? Sir, it had been prope'ly sa d by a
friend to his right [Mr Nicholas,] that the aboli-
tion of imprisonment h d ic'u ^d the circle of
debt It had done so, and the r'sults had been
beneficial to the people, and to the piosprnty of
the State He trusted that the b 11 would pass,
and that its provisions would sorn bTenl"  d um
versa! by the legislation of the American Congress
Mr BAYARD said, in reply, he was not advo-
cating imprisonment for debt as a punishment,
that, he admitted, would be a relic of barbarism,
but as the means of securing the honest creditor
from the fraudulent debtor The Senator from
New York had said that persons wer« imprisoned
as fetoos, -that he apprehended could not be the
case, thepmon bounds of New York, he believed,
were extended to the precwots of the whole city
Mr. TALLMADGE said he alluded to those
citizens who, when travelling to the city of New
York, had been arrested on mesne process, and be-
ing strangers, were alike unable to give bail for
their appearance, or for the privilege of the bounds,
and were consequently shut up in close confine-
ment as felons were.
The question -was taken on the amendment, and
it was adopted
The bill was further amended at the suggestion
of Mr PRENTISS, when
Mr. SEVIER asked for the yeas and nays on its
engiossment, when there appeared for the mea-
sure 36, against it 4, as follows

Mr GRUNDY introduced a resolution, which
lies over one day, m relation to changing the hotu

NORTHEASTERN BOUNDARY
The Senite íesumed the consideration of Mr
Wili iams's motion for leave to bring m a btll to
provide for the survey  an I  determination  of the
Northeastern bi uadary  of the United Siates ac-
cording to the treaty of 1783
The debate on this subject was continued by
Messrs CLAY of Kentucky, BUCHANAN, DA-
VIS, WRIGHT, CALHOUN, and RIVES
Leave was granted, and the bill was mtioduced
and read twice
Mr WRIGHT move! to refer it to the Commit-
tee on Foreign Relations
Mr WILLIAMS said that, considering the
importance of the question to Mame, and that her
Senators and Representatives were íeqiusted by
her Legislature to urge the pissagc of the bill
which had then been read, he fett it to be his dutv
to move its refeience to n select com mttec Mr
S did this without i itending the least disrespect to
the Committee on Foreign Relations, to which the
Senator from New York hid proposed the. re-
ference, ant to which, undei oilier ciuum tances,
ihere would be an obvious propriety in committing
the bill But it could not have escaped the notice
of the Senate that the chairman of ihe Committee
on Foreign Rehtions, in ihe cour e of t^e debate,
had stated his onin on that if tha bill should go
to that commitce it would probrbly keep it
without making a report, or report it back to the
Senate with notice that, when it should come up
for consideiation, he would move its indefinite
postponement With thia frank avowal of the
sentiments rf ths chairman of that committee, it
would be a dereliction of duty on his part to con-
sort that the b 11 should go to a committee from
which there was no prospect of a favorable report,
and, for this cause, he moved the reference of the
bill to a select committee
Mr DAVIS advocated its reference to a special
committee, on the giound that the chairman and
another most prominent member of ihe Committee
on Foreign Relations had already declared them-
selves hostile to the bill, and that both courtesy au4
