(Received 2.20 p.m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I have just received the following from General P. H. Sheridan. Shall I have the movement directed by him at once?

CEDAR CREEK, VA., October 12, 1864.

Major-General AUGUR,

Rectortown, Va.:

Your note to General Wright, commanding the Sixth Army Corps, received. I will not want to use the Manassas Gap Railroad. You can return with what troops you have on the road to Manassas Junction, or to the crossing of Bull Run, whichever you deem best. I want you to hold the troops there until you hear again from me. The Sixth Corps will move from Front Royal to Alexandria, via Ashby's Gap, to-morrow morning. There is a division of my cavalry now at Sperryville. It has probably gone to Warrenton, where it is said that McCausland's cavalry marched yesterday, intending to return to Culpeper last night. Early could not follow me down the Valley, but sent Rosser with all his cavalry, and Rosser was utterly routed, losing eleven pieces of artillery, all his wagons, caissons, &amp;c., his own headquarters wagons, with those of Lomax, Wickham, and Colonel Munford, commanding Rosser's brigade. The rout was complete. I will move another division of cavalry through Chester Gap to-morrow. I did not know that you were at Rectortown, or I would have gone over to see you when I was at Front Royal yesterday. It is said that Early moved a division of infantry to Culpeper, which probably may be true, but I doubt it. I think he is at Gordonsville or Charlottesville by this time.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.

RECTORTOWN, October 13, 1864.

(Received 8.40 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I have just received the following dispatch from General Sheridan. I shall therefore remain here unless otherwise ordered:

CEDAR CREEK, October 13, 1864.

GENERAL: News received from Washington since I wrote you last night make it necessary for you to hold on to your present position at Rectortown. I will try and get over and see you either this evening or to-morrow.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., October 13, 1864-5 p.m.

Major-General AUGUR,

Rectortown:

Dispatches sent to General Sheridan may change his views in regard to abandoning the railroad. Send the rolling-stock back to a safe position, place your troops in favorable places for defending road, and wait for further orders.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
