HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,July 13, 1864-10 p.m.

General S. WILLIAMS, U. S. Army.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

I have to report that my headquarters are at the Deserted House on the Norfolk road. One division is on the right of the road, another between the road and the railroad in rear of General Warren's headquarters, and Gibbon's division at the white house. General Gibbon's picket-line remains on as far around to the left as the plank road.

General WILLIAMS:

I would prefer to have the telegraph run to my headquarters at the Deserted House.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

Line will be run at once from Fifth Corps headquarters to General Hancock's.

Respectfully

MURRAY,

I find it takes all my personal attention and all the men I have to work on my left to-day, and I would like, if it can be done, to have your picket-line remain till to-morrow.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,July 13, 1864

The picket-line will remain as you desire. Please take charge of it and inform me when you wish to relieve it.
