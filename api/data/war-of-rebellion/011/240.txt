If you find a brigade of General Paine's division encamped on the other side of Tuscumbia River you will direct it to go forward and rejoin its division.

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,JNumbers POPE,

Cavalry just back from the burnt cars, 4 miles west of Chewalla, report forty cars burned up and destroyed and four locomotives in pretty good order. Found a party of Curtis' Horse with some engineers in possession, who will bring them to Corinth.
