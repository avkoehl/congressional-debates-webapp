APPJENQIX TO THE CONGBEgSIOWAL GLOBE.
Oregon Territory—Mr. Cushing.
H. of Reps.
«pon the integrity of the Senate be it eaid and yet, when tho
gentleman came to the practical question, what was to be done?
His sensibilities had shown themselves as illogical as passion
usually is Mr L understood both the gentleman fiom Vir
gima, and the gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr Natloh-Iio
agree that the treaty must, at all events, be executed
[IlereMr Wise explained Ht meant that he saw it woull
be unavailing to contend that the treaty might not to be rxecut
td, a decided majority having declared itself unalterably bent
ondomgso Btitfor hissinglesei/, he thought it ought not to
be enforced, and was ready so to vote ]
Mr L admitted that he might have misunderstood the gen
tleman, and done injustice to his logic But at any rate the
gentleman from Tennessee, whom he did nut then see in his
place [Mr Bell ] and who had delivered in the Committee of
the Whole a very able and statesmanlike speech upon th« sub-
ject, had expressly avowed the necessity of effecting the re
moval, and pointed out the terms on which it should be done
And, sir, said Mr L policy, justice, yea and meicy require
that this measure should be accomplished I say mercy, in the
only acceptation of the term which makes it a vntue, tha
which has been well deseubed by agreat man as "along sight
ed and strong nerved humanity,' which looks beyond the pre
sent moment with ill that is distressing in lis circumslances—
for lfyou dwell too much on euch things, when then, is no i e
medy for them ihey will drive you "mad" as the gentleman
from Pennsylvania [Mr Naylor] had confessed in regard to
himself—to the prospects of the futuie winch youi policy opens
np9n this noble tribe Sir, it is kindness to them to iemo\e
them They cannot exist in the midst of the white race Our
experience is unifoim and conclusive upon the subject * You
may depend upon 11 that, what with war, disease, and vice, ex
termina ion will be their fate where they are It is inevitable,
and il Ross deserves a tithe of what has been said of hiai ability,
he will perceive it, and set himself zealously about the g eat
work ol establishing and civilizing his tubem the pleamnt land
which has been assigned them, aloof from those contaminating
and destructive influences with which they will soon be enri
roned hrre
He would then proceed to inquire how far it was competent
for the House to m erfere with what had been done by the
treaty making power    He could not agree to the rigid proposi
tion that it was absolutely bound, neither did he concur with
thohp who thought it in no degree bound, by a treaty    During
the discussion in the French Chambei of Deputies on the sub
lectofihe Kte treaty with the United S ate^, a discussnn in
which he hid naturally füt a veiy deep interest it had, indeed,
beenassiimed in that assembly and he must confers that it ap
peaied to be conceded on all hands, that whenever anappio
pnation of mone>  or any othei act of legislation was required
to fulfil the condition of a treaty the Chamber of Deputies was
as free to íafu^e it=> concurrence in it as to any bill in the ordi
nary comse of Jegisluion    Mr   I scare said he did by no
means a^ent to that doctrine it was a licentious one  the dis
Unction appeared to him to be a veiy Pimple ene    tmdoubt
edlythit House might at any time take the responsibility of set
ting aside a treaty just as it might do  any thing else that
amounted to declaring war    Ithad the strict legal competence
to do bo, but he denied its moi a1 competence to interfere with a
treaty, unless it could e'early show fraud mistake, or some other
defect which vitiated it as a contract    It was not enough to
saj, we do not see xcky this treaty was ma le convince us that it
is as it ought to be or we\ote against it    This would! e to ren
der every negotiation that had not been ratified by the House
meiely nugttory ?i Mo require a renewal of it there contraiyto
the e:x preps words of the Constitution    The onvs probanch was
cieailj upon the Hou«e   Before it assumed the ie«-pon ibility of
refus ng its acquiescence in what b(imd the courts of the coun
tij   it must be able to  point out, with precision, some radical
moial defect or some irresistible State necessity    r\i>w he must
Fay that although he was free to own the gentleman from \ ir
gima   [Mi  Wise,j m the course of this debate  had thiown
gi ave doubt upon ihn regularity ofthe n&gotiaMon    amed on
with those | eople, he did not see his way clearly enough m the
business to pi onounce the solemn att of the Pi evident ard fp

'See a little tract from the venerable James Vsadsworih of

itself with the resolution of despair, m the fastnesses ota moun-
tainous region might cost us infinite trouble- It would rcquiro
scarcely less «me to take them up bodily and remove therñ,
though umesisting, as he had heard it intimated, we should be-
constrained to do But laying such considerations i>ut ofthe
queatmn, he could not persuade himself ffaat the people Of
Georgia would not do all they could to soften the severity* ofthe
law which had been imposed -upon this tribe, In commnfc%1tli
the iest of the aborigine  fíe would not beliere that they
thought and felt differently from the rest of the country «pon
this subject, oi that they were under the influence of mo i vea
which could lead them to disregard, ur violate the nghta of hu
manKy, further than an inevitable necessity, legal or political
might compel them to do eo From what he had understood,
he had been led to hope some amicable arrangement might be
effected
Then, as to the amount of compensation, it seems to be ad
nutted, on all hands, that, had the other conditions he proposed
been complied with, Ross would have accepted the $5,000,000
as a full price for the lands
[Here Mr Wise rose, and denied this Ross  he said, had
begun by demanding $20 000,000, <fec ]
Mr Legare Yes, but that was not his ultimatum The
proposal was manifestly extravagant, and he abandoned it
Mr h fcaid he had been assured by Senator3, fiee from all party,
oi indeed, any other bias, men of the highest honor, and the
most liberal feelings, that the Senate had acted with the single
view of making the largest compensation that could be de
manded by a reasonable man They did not, m the least, higgle
about the matter With a most liberal allowance of money,
they had given to this tribe a fertile and healthy country , and
he was sure that an equal number of our own fellow citizens,
in any State in the Union, such wtra their migratory habits,
would ha\ e abandoned ho nes more comfortable and fields bet
ter cultivated on a far less tempting offer \b to the additional
appropriation called for by the ¡secretary of War, he thought
the gentleman from Vermont, over the way, [Mr Everett,]
who had manifested such a benevolent solicitude about the fate
of the Cherokees, had nude out a very strong t. ase in favor of
his idea that the $5,000 000 was not, according toa fair inter
pretation of Ross's proposals, meant to include the objects of
expenditure for which the additional appropriation was now
aiked by the Executive lhat gentleman seemed to lay great
htiess on having this considered as matter of contract, and not
of beneficence To him (Mr I ) it was immaterial whether It
were bounty or obligation he was, he repeated ready to vote
foi it in either case, (or reasons he had fully explained
Anothei change which the Secretary had agreed to also met
his fullest approbation It related to the provision of the treaty
which seemed to have given particular offence to the leading
men ofthe Cheiokee tribe he meantthe paymentof the money,
not to those entitled to receive it, under what might be called
the Constitution of this quasi nation, but to the individuals that
composed H What justice had actuated the last Administration
in adopting, for the first time, in the case before it, that peculiar
policy, he had not the honor to know, and would not undertake
to divme But he thought the present Administration perfectly
right in abandenmg it to effect so dtsirable an ob'ect as the pa
ciiyma the eieat majority ofthe tribe He could readily con*
c*ive that this money if paid to individuals, might be unpro-
fitably thrown away, or render them a prey to the frauds of tir-
prmcipled men He trusted they would be pacified—that they
wfttild go jn peace to the land which had been prov ded lor
then future residence, and m which, if they have the capici
ticsofimpio-vement a^cubed to them by their pations here,
they miy be developed under ihe most favorable circumstances
Resistances was vam, he did not mean that a battle might not
be lost or a campaign frustrati d He spoke of the inevitable
result, m the long ii. n, of a contest between this tribe and the
Anglo Airei ican race A morass might be impracticable, a
foiest might cover the retreat of a frightened foe The savage
warrior might fancy lnm"elf a hero, because he avoided defeat
by avoidirg a combat m the open battle field But the day
would come when the most formidable of all race#,m its career
of irresistible aggrandizement, would sweep away eveiy rem-
nant ofthe aborigines which affected to withstand its progress
witnin its own border* I^etthem go not only in peace, but m
amity, assured that many and many of those who fsV them
selves constrained, by astern law to impose upon them svhat
apppiredtn be a hard condition felt the deepest sympathy witk
them and cherished the warmest good wishes for their future
hanpiness and improvement
