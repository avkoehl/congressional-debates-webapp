THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

vis] has asserted, and asserted repeatedly, that
though Senators objected to this appropriation, on
account of its U mg placed as an amendment to a
common <*} r i ipnation bill, yet no Senator had
object d to the pension sy^tti m, or would object
to th «i stem He should be happy to see some
gentleman submit a motion to instruct the Com
mil ce o i Penbions to bring in a bill repealing the
\v hole system The honorable gentleman would
tl en be convinced that theie was one Senatoi
at least who would take a stand ajainst all this
soit of feeling and sympathy which had been en-
gendered by an airay of an army of old ladies
against us We should not peimit our feelings
foi ladies, either young or old, to prompt us to
put our hands into the public Treasury These
pension bills find too easy access, they are passed
too easily I have known young athletic men to
come before the committee and chum pensions
granted to then mothers or othei relatives, and
when gianted, claim them as their own Why,
it was made a mere business of, as soon as a law
was passed, claims were hunted up by agents and
others that would have nevti been thought ef
Peisons who have no disposition to entei into th s
business, are induced to do so by repiesei tations
that their claim was as good as anothei's, that
theTieasury was full, and Congress did not know
what to do with the public money When the
first act was passed, pioviding for the soldiers of
the Revolution who were in need of pecumaiy
assistance, many of them were in comfoitable en
eumstances They were induced to'convey then
pioperty to their sons, took the oath of poverty,
and received their pensions Was not this a fiaud
morally speaking, and a fraud tempted by the
legislation- of this Govei nment * Notwithstanding
the great number of peisons on the pension hat,
at least five claims weie i jected to everyone that
was gianted, oioducing a &ieat deil oi hatied and
ill will to the Government, because every cl umant
thinks his claim and his ngnt to a pension, as
good as another's
With these views of the piesent pension sys
tern, I am prepaied to íepeal it I think it inju
nous to the country, and of compiratively little
good to those intended to be benefited I am
willing that the invalids and soldieis of the Rev
olution should be provided foi As íegaids the
act the appiopriation for which is under consid
ciation, he thought that, so far as duo, the pen
sion should be paid Until the law is changed
we should comply with its provisions, but the
amount already called foi undei its provisions
should warn us of the impolicy of continuing the
sjstem Heie aie aheady one thousand women
em oiled since last jeai, and how many moie will
b  enrolled no one can tell He hoped that some-
thing would be done by C ongrcss at an eaily d ly
t.s a guide for the action of the Committee on Pen
sionb, whethei we shouldrecomme id those cases
that appealed to our sympathies, or those of
whose justice our reason was convinced He
thought the whole system was liable to ob]PCtion,
that, even to tlie aged veteians intended to be ben-
efited by it, it has opeiatcd as an injuiy By
throwing them on the pittance of eigh dolltis a
month, tl ey ha\e been induced to neglect horn st
industry, and have been biought lo po\eity lit,
hoped thatsomemembci, who had taken an active
pait in this discussion, would bun  foiwud a
proposition lo repeal the law, and he would be
prepaied to spread his views befoie the Smite
and the country
Mr PIERCC said When I lose at the same
moment with the Senator from Ohio, [Mr Mor
kis,] it was with the intention of making some
explanations, which I consideied due from the
committee by whom the bill of last session, which
has been so often refeired to.wasiepoited Those
explanations have been made, as I trust, satis
factorily, by the Senator who has just resumed
his seat
The attention of the Senate has been called, in
the piogress of this debate, rot only to the pen
sion system generally, but, as is not unusual here,
to Vinous othei matters, historical, political, and
financial     With these topics I have at piesent
nothing to do, and although I have very decided
opinions as to the inequality and injustice of some ¡
of the provisions of the various pension laws, and I
a much stronger belief than I could destie to en- i
tertain of frauds perpetrated undei them, still the
proposition now pending to meet obligations ím '
posed by existing laws does not anpear to me to '
be the appropriate one for discussing the policy
of past legislation That question, as applicable
to this subject, I will say, in '■eply to a remaik '
of the Senator neai me, 1 shall probably have oc-
casion to raise m a few days, by the introduction
of a bill to piovide for the punishment of certain
frauds committed on persons claiming pensions,
and for other puiposes
Whatever might have become the subjects of
speculation in these times, when the imaginations
of men seem to be unusually occupied with
schemes for acquiring sudden and abundant riches
without labor, one would have expected that the
soldieis of the Revolution and their widows might
have escaped the graspi ng avarice of all men, how-
ever destitute of principle But such is not the
fict, as an American citizen, I say it with shame,
but the tiuth must be told, it must be told, for the
protection of the feeble, the ignorant, and the un
suspecting Such fiauds.I am assured by infoim-
ation denved from vaiious sources, and in part
fiom the Depaitment which has charge of this
subject, aie extensive as they are disgraceful
Tor the benefit of successful claimants, who may
draw then first payments before the bill to which
I have referred can be considered by Congress, I
desne at this time, and upon this proposition for
an appiopriation, to make a few remarks
I have been informed,and believe it to be true,
that the passage of the law of July last, and the
passage of preceding laws of a similar eharactei,
have been the signal for agents to traverse the
countiy in every direction in search of the aged
and imbecile persons therein  provided for, not I
with the laudable motive of assisting them to se-
cuie their ughts at the least possible expense,
but to practice upon their credulity, and impose
upon then weakness and then  ignorance     It is
notonous that contiacts have not unfrequenlly
been made by such agents by which, if success
ful, they were to receive a large portion of the
amount which should first be diawn, in many
instances twenty five per cent , m otheis fifty per
cent , and in some evt.n more, and in cates wheie
no speoiú contiact has been made, the mo t ex
oibuantfeeshave been demanded and piid   Since
mj amval in this city, 1 have received a lettei
giving the name of a cí rtam agent who obtained,
during the last summer or the early part of au-
tumn, a ceiufieate foi an aggd widow, under the
act of 1836, by which she was entitled to receive,
in September last, $600     The money was duly
paid, and the agent claimed and letamed foi his
sei vices the sum of J250     I name this as an m   I
dividual instance recently brought to my knowl
edge     A  fair and  liberil compensation foi all
services rendeied and expenses  mcuricd, m oi
dmaiy cases, undei the  act  of the last session,
would be fiom  five to  ten dollar   i i veiy few
instances should such compensation exceed the
Httu sum, the evidence of the husband's service
being generally on file in the Department
It may be asked how the claimants aie mduceu
to make such contiacts, when the provisions of
the hw arc plain, and the legulauons of the Dp
paitnent simple and easy to be complied with,
and vhy they submit to suco exorbitant ehaiges?

mems by which agents are cnableu to cheUand
defiaud the pensione The thing has been done,
and L fear will continue to be done, as long as
money sh \H be drawn fiom youi Tieasury foi
these pen poses Pensioners have been i ibbed
of no small poition of the pit anee intended to
beseemed to them and them alone Yes, sir,
woise than íobbed, for men who ha\e bo far foi
gotten their manhood, nay who have so enl lely
cast off all sense of honor and common honesty,
as to speculate upon and plunder revolutionary
soldiers, or the helpless widows who may sur j
vive them, are sunk in disgrace infinitely below
the level of the brigand, who openly confronts
you upon the highway and demands your purse
Thus much 1 have thought it my duty to say, to
put persons entitled to pensions upon their guard
against these cormorants, and I hope that my
íemarks may fall not only under the obseivation
of the agents, who have argus eyes for every
thing i elating to this subject, but that they may
leach some of the woithy claimants If they
shall have any effect in preventing injustice and
extoition, my object will be attained All such
agreements as I have before alluded to are con-
ceived and consummated in fiaud, and aie in di-
íect violation of the spirit and intention of the
law They are in no way obligatory, legally
oi morally, and should be so íegarded by the
pensioner
Mr WRIGHT made a brief explanation of
the reasons which pieventcd the Committee on
Finance fiom recommending this amendment
when applied to to do so by the Senator from Nety
Jersey Although he thought that this appro-
priation ought to be made, inasmuch as it wau
called for by an express law of Congress, which
all admitted ought to be carried into effect, yet,
as it was an appropriation sui genens, and liad
always been piovtded for by the House of Rep*-
resentatnes in a separate bill, he thought it
ought not to be ingrafted on the bill thenhefore
them, and would prefer its coming from fhe
House of Repiesentatives, where it ought prop-
erly to originate, in a bill of tts own
Mr BUCHANAN did not intend togo farther
into this question, but he lose to protestaga"mst
its being admitted that this body was not compe-
tent to originate appiopriation bills He knew
that, upon a very fate occasion, when an attempt
was made in that body to introduce a large ap-
piopriation in a House bill, this questiort'was
raised, but he íesisted the principle then ftwSs
tiue that buidens laid on the people must origin-
ate in the House of Repiesentatives, butaffei the
money has gone into the lieasury, it was giving
up too much by the Senate to admit that they
ha\e no ns;ht to ouginate an appropnation of it
Mr WRIGHT explained He never doubted
the light of the Senate, as claimed by the Sen-
ator fiom Pennsylvania, he only spoke of the
piactice
Mr BUCHANAN said that the question was
of practice, and not of power, foi, on that occa-
sion, gentlemen weie very ready to exercise the
latter Though it had not been the practice in
that body, since he had been there, yet to ajjpro-
puation bills of that nature, coming fiom the
House, laige appropriations had been added if
ho weie to admit that the Senate ought not to
ougip-ile such bills, tne case presented by the
Senator from INew Jersey ought -io be an excep-
tion to the mle As to those widows who weie
man led I etween 1783 and 1794, he dio! not know
vv 1 ether he would have voted for them or not,
but as the faith of the Government was to be re-
deemed, ai d there was a latge amount of aneara
due fiom the time of the passage of the act till
now, he hoped the amendment would be adopted
H did not believe there was a Senator present
who would vote against the appropriation if it
came up in a way he approved of Even the
Senatoi fiom South Carolina admitted that the
faith of the Government was pledged As this
was a proposition to cairy into effect an existing
law, he must vote in the affirmative, but if it were
not a proposition to cairy into execution an exist
ing law, he must consider that there was some
fofce in the objections of gentlemen who had
opposed it
Mi STRANGE -said that he should vote
against the amendment of the Senator from New
Jo sey, for most of the reasons assigned by the
gentlemen who had opposed it He disliked taking
up this matter of importance and connecting tí
with a matter of equal importance wholly dissim
liar to it In order to enable Senators to cone to
a coi rect conclusion with regard to it, it ought to
stand on its own merits It had been suggested,
in the course of the debate, that theie was a gen-
eral hvv lequinng these pensions to be paid at
stated periods—in March and September Now
there certainly was time enough between this and
Mmch to piovide for the cases embiaced jn this
amendment, and the airearages could be put off
till that time But this was a matter of great im
portance, and not a vague question of expediency
only     He believed that it was part of a great
