HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 26, 1864-3.30 p.m.

General BARTLETT:

Information has been received from a deserter that the enemy designs in the course of twenty-four hours to make a demonstration on our left to see what is there. I wish you would have a battery ready to go into position on the breast-works near General Griffin's headquarters and a regiment to support it. I wish this arrangement to be adopted in all cases of an attack from the left.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 26, 1864.

Colonel F. T. LOCKE:

SIR: It may not be improper to state that trenches on my immediate right are very lightly manned. If the men were properly dressed up they would not make more than a single rank, unless men have been added within an hour or two. They are colored troops.

L. CUTLER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, July 26, 1864-9 a.m.

General WILLIAMS, Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report incessant musketry by both sides during the night. The enemy's pickets were very active. During the night a brigade of the Fourth Division relieved one of General Willcox's brigades. It was done so quietly that we met very slight loss. Fourteen guns have been placed in position in the new battery near the burnt house.

A. E. BURNSIDE,Major-General.

We need 8,000 sand-bags as soon as possible to be used in tamping the mine. Can your order them delivered to us at once? The object in having them here now is that they may be filled and in readiness to prevent delay. Please answer.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
