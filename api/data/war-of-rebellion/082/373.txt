Captain R. A. HUTCHINS,Asst. Adjt. General, Third Division, Ninth Army Corps:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report no charge on my front since last evening's report. About seventy pieces of abatis timber were put out during the night; more will be put out to-night; 400 or 500 sandbags are needed for the use of the brigade. During the late rain the earth has settled considerably, and besides many of the bags have been cut to pieces by the enemy's bullets. I would suggest that sandbags instead of grain-sacks be procured. The latter cannot be used as advantageously on the pits.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. HARTRANFT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
