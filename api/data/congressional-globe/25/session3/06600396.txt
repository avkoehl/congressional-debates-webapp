Treasury Department, September 22, 1835
Sir Allow me to inquire why it is that your deposits
are not madf in the branch of tlie Planter's Bank at Colum
bu , instead of the parent bank at Natchez? Does the
branch refuse to receive them, and credit the amount at the
mother bank*
I am, &c ,                                 LEVI WOODBURY,

P S Your return for the month of February last has been
received to day, and shows a large imount on hand not de
ported , ind you nrc hereby required, if not already done,
to deport any balance stilt on hind in the above branch, to
the credit of the Trensuiy, and forward receipts therefor, m
order to save mm and expense in traveling to Natchez
It seems, sir, he liked to have forgotten that the
fellow was in default at all' The postscript rec-
ollects it, but then merely iequests the perform-
ance of an oft-neglected duty ' But he writes him
again in a week

Sir Your letter of the 13th instant, inclosing your re
turn for the month of November, is received Again if be-
comes my unpleasant duty to complain of your neglect in
this respect, and to inform you that the omission to trans-
mit the required monthly statements, for a whole quarter
after they are due, cannot be permitted in any public officer,
and especially after having been heretofore so often re
minded of the consequences of such neglect On the return
of the mail, therefore, if the usual statements for the Other
months in arrear are not received, I shall be under the dis
agreeable necessity of again submitting the subject to the
President, for his immediate action

Sir Your letter of the 23d ultimo, accompanied by your
returns for the month of April, is received Seeing the
bal ince of public moneys in your hands amounted to
>128,884 70 at the end of that month, I have to request
that you will explain why it was that the whole of the pub
he moneys in your bunds on the last of the previous month
wis not desposited, instead of a pirt, in conformity to ex-
plicit md frequent instructions on that point It is painful
to be obliged to ask you so often for expían itions

He "regieUS* after letting him run on from
March 6,1834, to September 21,1836—two yeais
and six months'—to inform him "thatasJong
ago as August last, steps were taken "—taken at
last, Mr Speaker, after the horse was stolen'
the fellow was full'—" to attempt to secure the
balance due fiom him' Was theie evei such a
flagrant case before confessed, under the official
hand and seal, by a head of a Department?
Yes, sn , just such a one in the instance of this
Hains's succesioi, a man named Boyd' Sir,
would not one have leasonably supposed that the
Stcretaiy would have been caieful to pievent his
veiy successot fiom doing the very same thing'
Was it too much to expect that he would at least
havi bet n watchful to ptevent the same abuse
immediately in th< same office? Sir, it was even
woise boon aftei his appointment, the Secie-
taty wiote to him as follows

I am, &c ,                                  LEVI WOODBURY,
Secretary of the Treasury,
Receiver of Public Money, Columfus, Mississippi
In the mean time, sir, the Secretaiy had ap-
pointed V M G-aresché, a citizen of Delaware,
I believe, an examiner of this office at Columbia,
and others, to íeportupon Us condition. After
this last lettei to Boyd, Garesche made his repoi t,
on the 14th day of June, 1837, dnected to Levi
Woodbury, Secretary of the Tteasuty. Prom
that report, sn, contained in this official docu-
ment, No. 397, I extract the following'
"The account of the receiver, winch I have made out
and transmit herewith, presents against him a balance of
$55,965 54 His own iccount makes it $53,272 73, it is
also annexed His assets, of which I also send you the list,
amount to $61,549 98, rating the land at $1 25 only, but
might probably realize double the amount. The man seems
really penitent, and I am inclined to think, in common with
his friends, that he w honesty and has been led away from
hts duty by the eccample of his predecessor, and a certain
looseness in the code of morality which here does not move in
so limited a circle as it does with us at home Another re-
ceiver would probpbly follow in the footsteps of the two
You will not, theiefoie, be surprised if I recommend his
bemz retained^ in preference to another appointment) for he
has his hands full now, and will not be disposed to speculate
anymore lit will have his bond signed by the same sure-
ties, and forwarded in a few days to Washington, tins
spc lies favorably He 1ms, moreover, pledged his word that,
it tet lined ho will strictly obey tlie 1 iw, an l recene nothing
but specie in pa ¡went for lands lie tell  me that he is about
selliiiíí agieat portion of his lands, that and some other
negotiation will enable hun to d schaige a Urge portion of
hi;, debt to the United States beioie the c\pn mon ot the
ptcscnt quaitci Lpmty towanU him, theiefoie, might

p irah z I h ive in the mean limp c i joined the clon >g of
the I tnd office until the bond is compleltd and returned iía
land has been sold since the 29iA ultimo   '
Si i, is there any parallel to this in the history
of coiruption ? He lepotts to the Secietaiy that
Boyd is a defaultti to the amount of $55,965 54,
in less than twelve months1 Among; his assets
we find enumeiated a puncipality of the public
lands' A mon^tei monopoly he, he had ab-
soibed public land and public money, too ' And,
sn, he is íecommended to be " letamed in pief-
eitnce to another appointment," foi the reason
that the dog or the fox gave for not dnving off
the goiged swtum of fiVs lest a lank and hungiy
svvaim would immediately fasten on the body'
lie has ins hmdsjidl now, and will not speculate
any mote' He will give a bond signed by the
same securities, and has pledged hi<¡ wo)d for a
faithful pctformance of duty, and to receive noth-
ing but specie ' The land office closed for his mal-
feasance in office ' Great (jod, was evei public
crime more flagitious and unblushing' Heieis
his list of assets, which will show you what he
had probably been doing with the public money,
to use which foi ptivate profit, we aie now told,
should be made felony by statute
