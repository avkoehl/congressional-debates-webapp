FORT SUMTER, May 10, 1864 - 10.10 a. m.

SIR: I have the honor to report there [are] seven monitors inside the bar, and for the last two days steamers have been observed visiting them, I suppose supplying them with ammunition. There is a small working party near the flag-staff in middle battery, and the gin mentioned yesterday is still in position, doubtless for the purpose of mounting a gun, as there is none to be seen under it now. Yesterday evening a volley of 6 mortar shells was fired at the fort, 5 of which struck. Two parrott shells, both of which struck, were fired also. This morning 4 shots from a 10-inch columbiad in the extreme left of middle battery were fired at the east angle; 2 struck.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. C. MITCHEL,

Captain, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT SUMTER, May 11, 1864 - 12.35 p. m.
