plies up that river and are prepared to hold that line. The rebel troops are no doubt disheartened, and if we should make a dash among them it would probably cause many to desert.

Major General F. J. HERRON:

(Care of Colonel A. H. Ryan, Lewisburg.)

GENERAL: General Canby was severely wounded while on a gun-boat near mouth of White River en route to Little Rock. The ball passed through below his hip, went through the scrotum, and hit the penis. The wound is very painful, but not considered dangerous. He went back to New Orleans. I have sent what little military news there was to General Thayer. No news from the North. Nearly all the soldiers in this command voted for Mr. Lincoln.

F. STEELE,

Major-General.

Major General E. R. S. CANBY,

Commanding Military Division of West Mississippi:

GENERAL: A man belonging to Shelby's command, who was captured between Lewisburg and Dardanelle, says Shelby is moving toward Dardanelle. I suspect that Magruder is moving a considerable force up the Arkansas to meet Price. I am anxious about the supply train sent to Fort Smith. If it should be threatened Geiger will go to their support. I do not know whether or not they crossed at Dardanelle. I gave it as my opinion to the commander of the escort that he had best keep the stage road on the north side of the river.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. STEELE,

Major-General.
