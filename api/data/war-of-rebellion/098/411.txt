Numbers 55. Report of Bvt. Major General Giles A. Smith, U. S. Army, commanding Fourth Division, of operations January 6-March 24.
HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Goldsborough, N. C., March 25, 1865.

I have the honor to report the following operations of the troops under my command during the campaign through South and North Carolina just closed by the occupation of Goldsborough:

On Friday, January 6, my division embarked on transports at Thunderbolt Landing six miles below Savannah, and arrived at Beaufort the next day. January 13, by order of Major General F. P.

The River was bordered on each side by a wide and almost impenetrable swamp, crossed by a long causeway and a succession of bridges, the former of which, being burned, rendered the crossing in front of the enemy impossible. In accordance with orders received from Major General F. P. Blair, at 2 p.m. on Friday, February 3, I proceeded with my division to cross the Salkehatchie River and Swamp between Broxton's and Rivers Bridges. Two regiments of my command, the Fifty-third Indiana and Thirteenth Iowa, were, by General Blair's order left at Broxton's Bridge to keep up an appearance of crossing at that point. The apparently impassable swamp had been reconnoitered by fifty men from the Thirty-second Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, under com-
