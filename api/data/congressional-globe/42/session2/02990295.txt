documents l?01l supreme court judges
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. _ I offer the fol-
lowing resolution, and ask for its present con-
sideration :
Resolved, That a copy of the Daily and Congres-
sional Globe, and of sucli documents as are printed
by order of the Senate, except those tor its exclusive
use, be furnished to each ot' the judges ot the
Supreme Court of the United States.
Mr. HAMLIN. Let that resolution lie over.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Objection being
made, the resolution will lie over. As this res-
olution provides for an increase of the number
of documents, the Chair will suggest to the
Senator from Maine that probably, under the
law, it should be referred to the Committee on
Printing.
Mr. HAMLIN. Very well.
Mr. FRELINHUYSEN. I have no objec-
tion to that.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It will be so
referred.
retrenchment committee.
Mr. HAMLIN. I desire to offer a resolu-
tion which, if I am right in my recollection of
the state of business before the Senate, it
becomes necessary for uÂ§ to act upon at this
time. It will take but a single moment:
Resolved, That the Committee on Investigation
and Retrenchment be authorized to sit during the
sessions of Congress.
There being no objection, the Senate pro-
ceeded to consider the resolution.
Mr. HAMLIN. I do not remember that
such leave has been given to that committee.
They are in session in New York to-day, and
certainly they cannot swear witnesses; their
acts will be illegal. I have therefore offered
this resolution, and hope it will pass.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Onght it not to read,
"During the sessions of the Senate" instead
of "during the sessions of Congress?"
Mr. SUMNER. That is the proper term.
Mr. HAMLIN. I will modify the resolu-
tion by striking out " Congress" and inserting
" Senate."
The resolution, as modified, was adopted.
collection of customs.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The morning
hour lacks but one moment of completion, and
if there is no objection, the Chair will regard
the morning hour as expired. It has expired,
and the amnesty bill being the unfinished busi-
ness on the 21st of December last, is before
the Senate, the pending question being on the
amendment offered by the Senator from Mas-
sachusetts, [Mr. Sumneb.] The Senator from
New York [Mr. Fentox] has risen in pursu-
ance of a previous notice, and will state for
what purpose.
Mr. FENTON. When I reported, some three
weeks ago, Senate bill No. 2, to regulate the
service in the collection of customs, &c., I
staled that I would ask the Senate to take up
the bill at one o'clock to-day for the purpose
of enabling me to submit some remarks in
explanation of it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The amnesty bill
being before the Senate asthe unfinished busi-
ness of the last legislative sitting, the Senator
from New York asks that it may be informally
passed over that he may submit some remarks,
as he previously gave notice of his intention
to do, on a bill introduced by himself, and
reported by the Finance Committee, in regard
to the organization of the customs service.
Mr. MORTON. I hope the amnesty bill
will be passed over informally by unanimous
consent that the Senator from New York may
be allowed an opportunity of submitting his
remarks.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It will require
unanimous consent or a motion to set it aside.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I observe that the Sen-
ator from South Carolina, [Mr. Rohertsox.]
who has charge of the amnesty bill, is not in
his seat, this morning. I desire myself to have
that bill passed at an early day, but I will not
insist on going on with it this morning, as he
is not in his seat, and l am willing, for one,
that it shall go over informally; but I hope it
will not be understood that it is to be passed
out of the way.
Mr. MORTON. Certainly not.
Mr. SAWYER. My colieague, who has
charge of the amnesty bill, will necessarily be
absent Suring the whole of the present week.
I share the desire of the Senator from Illinois
that the amnesty bill may not lose it place. _ I
should like to inquire whether it will lose its
place by this proceeding.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair was
about to state that the request of the Senator
from New York is that the unfinished business
be informally passed over. By the usage of
the Senate, when the unfinished business is
passed over, it is liable to be called up at any
moment by any Senator; so that before the
adjournment to-day the amnesty bill can be
called up at any moment by any Senator who
sees fit to do so, and left as the unfinished
business. It can be called up by any Senator
demanding the regular order, and then it will
be the unfinished business. The Chair hears
no objection to the unfinished business being
passed over informally. The amnesty bill can
be called up at any moment previous to the
adjournment this day by any Senator demand-
ing the regular order.
The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole,
proceeded to consider the bill (S. No. 2) to
regulate the service in the collection of cus-
toms at tlie various ports of entry in the Uni-
ted States, and to dispose of fines, penalties,
and forfeitures incurred under the laws relat-
ing to customs, and for other purposes.
Mr. FENTON. I send the bill to the Sec-
retary's desk, and ask that it be read.

stand if the amendments reported by the Com-
mittee on Finance were agreed to, as follows:
