Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I rise to op-
pose the amendment. I do not want to have
the rate of duty cut down to five cents. I a«k
the attention of the committee and especially
of the gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr.
Kelley,] who has spoken very pathetically
this morning, to a few questions, lask, what
is the use of giving the people of the country
free tea and coffee, if for the benefit of the
people represented by that gentleman you
keep up the duty on ranges and stoves on
which you boil your tea and coffee at seventy
per cent, ad valorem t What is the use of'
giving them free tea and coffee if you keep up
the duty on the kettle and hollow ware at
forty-six per cent, ad valorem f What is the
use of giving them free tea and coffee if on
the tin cup from which they drink it you keep
up a duty of thirty-five per eent. ad valorem,1

if upon the copper kettle yon keep up a duty
of forty-five percent, ad valorem% What is
the use of giving free tea and coffee if for the
toasting-fork, the very toasting-fork you use
for toasting your bread, a duty is kept up of
seventy-two per cent, ad valorem?
Mr. MAYNARD. Mr. Chairman 
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Hush!

What is the use of giving free tea and coffee
§No estimate can be made of reduction.
if upon the pan in which the poor man fries
his cakes you keep up a duty of forty-six per
cent, ad valorem ? What is the use of free tea
and free coffee if upon the hollow ware you use
in your kitchen you keep up a duty of forty-six
and a half per cent, ad valorem1 Talk not to me
of free tea and coffee when upon the very coal
the poor people use to kindle their fires you
keep up a duty of forty-three per cent, ad
valorem, and upon the very fire-wood im-
ported across the line from Canada and New
Biunswick you keep up a duty of twenty per
cent, ad valorem.
Mr. PETERS. Fire-wood is on the free list.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. There is a
duty of twenty per cent, ad valorem on fire-
wood.
What is the use of free tea and coffee if
upon the very soap with which you wash
your plates and cups and saucers, you keep
up a duty of forty-five per cent, ad-ealorem'i
If upon the very woolen rags with which you
wash your iron dishes and kettles you keep a
duty of twelve cents per pound and one hun-
dred and eightv per cent, ad valorem'} If upon
your towels, with which you dry your dishes,
if of linen, you keep up a duty of forty per
cent., and if of cotton a duty of from sixty-
five to seventy per cent.? Upon the very water
which, is used in your kitchen, if not drawn
