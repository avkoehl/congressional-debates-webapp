from Pollard to General Pemberton several weeks ago. I have there only a few companies of cavalry to guard the front and but one infantry regiment. I have no other infantry in the department. My entire garrison for the water and land defenses of Mobile is one regiment acting as artillery. I am sending now the only cavalry battalion left me. Only three small companies remain to guard the coast towards Pascagoula.

Cannot General Beauregard send me re-enforcements? The enemy are making another raid down the railroad in Mississippi.
