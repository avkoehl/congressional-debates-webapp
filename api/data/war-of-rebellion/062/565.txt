HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES ON THE RIO GRANDE,Brownsville, Tex., March 11, 1864.

Brigadier General CHARLES P. STONE,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Since my letter of yesterday I have received the inclosed copy* of an official circular issued at Monterey, containing an important communication from the commander of the French army to Governor Vidauri, and the reply of the latter, together with a proclamation to the people.

It is understood that Vidauri will turn over to the French at the proper time the States of Nuevo Leon and Coahuila, and that the French commander will then make him governor of Tamaulipas. Juarez has appointed General Negrete military governor of Nuevo Leon and Coahuila, and he is now marching against Monterey. Troops have also been ordered by Juarez to Piedras Negras. This express also brings statement of the loss at Guadalajara, making it 1,000 French and 3,000 rebel Mexicans prisoners, together with a number of pieces of artillery.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. J. HERRON,

Major-General.

GENERAL: In reply to your communication of the 5th instant, the major-general commanding directs me to say that owing to movements about to be made by the army under his command it is impracticable to send re-enforcements to Helena at present, and that in case of any serious demonstrations by the enemy on that place, troops can be called from Memphis or from those soon to be passing up and down the river.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
