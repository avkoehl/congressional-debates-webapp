Vr BENTCV rose m íeply to the Senator from

the President or the Secretary of the Tieisj y
m-ignt think it necessaiy to do m consequence of
the vote given by the Sena e yesterday on the de
posite íesolu lors, but he did know tha' tne Senate
was not th£ Congress, and that it was to Congress
oily that the Secieta'-y was to ma! e his report of
reasons foi removing tne deDOSi'esfiom the Fedeial
bank When the voice of Congress was hearl, I
it mi=ht b  pioper for the President and Secretary
to consider whi' ought to be done but a voice
f om i single branch of Congress w>u!d never be

si d Congiess could hrve bin one vote  tne two
Houses might have two voices and, if the voice
of the Senate was one waj, and that of the House o'
Representatives the other way, which vas to gov-
|i ein'—especially, was the smaller body to govern
1 thegreatei —the one most remote from the people
to govern tne one neaiest to the people - the o«e
which could not originate a money bill, to govern
j the one, m a question of revenue, which has the
p cuhai ch irge of the revenue, and the sole power
I  of oi igtnating money Ul  '
Mr  B  did not know what the President and
I Secre a y mij t think they ought to do in conse-
qutnee of yesterday's vote, he knew what he
thought they ougl t to do, and that was, nothing
£.0 fai from having the voice of Congiess, theie
was no v ay for the Executive, or for the other
nan of Congiess, to know what the Senate had
done Then íesolutiors were sirgle, not joint
rheie was no way to communicate them to the
Pies.dent, oi to tie House Joint resolutions
vent to both, snisU ones did not, and these reso
'ut ons miBht ht on theSenatejouinnls till dooms-
day, and ne (her tne President or the House of
Representatives could legally, regularly, oi in any
I parliamentary way, know of their existence.
They cou d not legularly tike notes of them
Tnese resolutions are momahes They have no
relation to the House, or the Piesident, tney lead
to no action they tend to ditim te the two Houses,
and to segregate their opinions A joint íesolu-
tion goes from one to another, it receives the ac-
tiun of botn, it unites the sense of both, but this
sn gle resolution stays whei e it was born, it leads
to no joint action, but to separate action—to no
unanimity of opinion, but to diversity of opin-
ion—to no haimory, but to discord between the
Houses Foi, what is the House to think of a
pietension on the pait of the Senate to assume to
ttcelf t he powers of Congress >—to assume sum erne
liirisd etion ovei a subject, and that subject an
arn of revenue and set up its will as superseding
tne w 11 of the House, and standing for the voice
00  the whole Congress5    In eveiy point of view,
1  e (Mi B 1 considered the Senate's proreedmg as
in anomaly and that the best thing that could
i appen for the Sei ate would be for the Piesiuent,
ai d the House of Repiesen'atives, to take no
i o ice of it until a parliamentary communication
of the proceedng could be made to them, and as
that never could be done, so they would remain
li ignorane  of it forever   Certainly neither House
' can know what the other does, except from an
aut lentip communication, certainly the Piesident
cannot know what is done in either House
except upon a íegular communication, under the
authonty of the House Newspaper reports,
vcibal m'elligence, the statements of members,
ire no autho-ity for coordinate branches of the
Coveinment to act upon, and, in parliamentary
undeistandirg, neither the House of Representa-
tives, or the Presilent knows anything of the
resolu ions which were adopted here yesterday
Bei g on his feet, Mi B would take notice of
another rem„ik which fell from the Senator from
Vngmia, [Mi Llicii ] He spoke o' the Bank
c f tr e United States as bei ig t^e Treasu"y of the
Un ted States It was not the first time he had
so sno ten of that bonk but this was the filet time
that h (Mi B ) 1 id found it convenient to call the
attent on of thu Senator to an argument against
his assumption, wl ch had been seveial times used
wit lout uiav tng an answer fiotn those who held,
s he [Mr Lri( n] i id, that the Federal bank was
'he Iederal irfasuty Doubt'ess hey did not
snswei, because they thcught the argument too
insignificant to meiit an answer Ther  weie some,
hovvevei, who thought other vise—a ho thought
that this argurientanmhilated then wholeassump-
lon end that the only way to get over it was to
"o rou hi it—the only way "o answer it, was to
se m not to hear it He (Mr B ) wished to know
if theSenetir from Virginia was of the same mind,
and theretoie would state this argument to him
it was tuunded on the 14th fund imental article of
wl at the ch iter called the cons itution of the
bant— ne rrticle which provided for the estah-
hshriei t o' branche —and was in the e woids
" The drectois of said coiporation shall estab-
1 lis i a competent offite of discount and deposite
