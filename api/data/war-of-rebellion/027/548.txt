Hill, that we in return might enfilade the enemy's works. Colonel Miles sent one gun down the railroad, on Shenandoah River, to our extreme left. A two-gun battery near Winchester Railroad was got ready for action, anticipating an advance of the enemy to turn our left flank. The attempt was made about midnight, but Brigadier General White with great skill foiled the enemy. Finding but 36 rounds of ammunition left for the most effective guns, it was equally divided.

September 15.-Daylight discovered the enemy's batteries moved up to close range, and multiplied; seven batteries now opened fire, enfilading the works on Bolivar Heights. Our batteries replied immediately, and the firing was constant and rapid. Brigadier-General White and staff, with Colonel Miles and staff, exposing themselves to the terrific fire of the enemy, gave great confidence to the troops on Bolivar, who stood like veteran until the surrender. Captain Phillips and Von Sehlen's batteries rendered useless for want of ammunition. Captain Graham soon exhausted the ammunition for the 20-pounder Parrotts. Captains Potts and Rigby keep up a destructive fire on the enemy. General White orders these last-mentioned to move to a position nearer the enemy and Shenandoah River, from which they opened a sharp and effective fire. Reported to the commanding, officers that the ammunition wa nearly expended. After a consultation of officers, it was decided to surrender. The flag was struck about 9 a. m.; white flags were shown on the heights, but the enemy continued their fire twenty minutes. During this time, and some time after the white flags were shown, Colonel miles fell mortally wounded. He remarked, "I have done my best, and what I thought to be my duty. This is a fit end for a soldier."
