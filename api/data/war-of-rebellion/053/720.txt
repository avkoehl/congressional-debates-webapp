been used. Scott's and Hodge's brigades have their wagons with them, and he can do nothing toward supplying the others, as his train is at Graysville, Ga.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. W. ANDERSON,

Aide-de-Camp.
HDQRS. DEPT. WESTERN VIRGINIA AND EAST TENNESSEE, Carter's Depot, Tenn., September 30, 1863.

His Excellency President DAVIS,Richmond, Va.:

I have ordered General Ransom forward with a sufficient force, I think, to drive the enemy's rear guard beyond Greeneville, and, if practicable, beyond Bull's Gap. I shall return to Dublin, as accounts I have from the Kanawha I think make it desirable. I have heard nothing from General Bragg.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A., Richmond, October 1, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON,

Commanding Department of the West:

GENERAL: Information has been received that the Mississippi Central Railroad Company evinces an unwillingness to save, for the use of the Government, its rolling-stock, whenever endangered by the operations of the enemy in your department. It would, therefore, be well to seize, to prevent capture by the enemy, or impress the rolling-stock of this company in all instances where, in your judgment, it is injudiciously exposed to capture by the enemy, with a view to preserving it for future use in transportation on that and other roads.

Very respectfully, yours,

JAMES. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

BETWEEN ABBEVILLE AND ROCKY FORD, October 1, 1863.

General BRAGG,

Near Chattanooga:

Captain Henderson reports that on the 28th four major-generals were at Memphis. Sherman's corps moving by railroad via Corinth; thirty-six transports at Vicksburg for other troops. Hurlbut's corps about to move via Paducah.

J. E. JOHNSTON.
