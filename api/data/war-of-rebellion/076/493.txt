Brigadier General J. KILPATRICK,

Commanding Third Cavalry Division:

The general commanding directs that you cross the Chattahoochee, fortify position at the bridge, and scout and clear the country of rebels to Camp Creek. Your train will be kept near the railroad bridge until your position on the south side is securely established.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HDQRS. CHIEF OF CAVALRY, DEPT. OF THE CUMBERLAND,August 14, 1864.

General KILPATRICK:

You will make a bold reconnaissance in the direction of Fairburn to railroad if you can reach it. It is reported that Wheeler with 6,000 cavalry and artillery has gone north. If true, you will have only Jackson's cavalry to contend with. If the opportunity offers try to break him up. General Schofield's small force of cavalry will be ordered to co-operate with you. It is on the south side of Utoy Creek, and will report to you at Sandtown to-morrow.

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Cavalry.
