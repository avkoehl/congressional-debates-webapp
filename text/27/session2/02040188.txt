navy alone prevented the establishment ot a des-
potism such as none of the Csesars ever equalled m
power, and which would very speedily have over-
shadowed the world. This bad been their honest
belief; but public opinion condemned it. The
war which ensued bad terminated with the <all of
«the French Emperor, gwd the United Slates came
into the general pacificat on of the world—two
events most tnxiously desired by the Federal
party. The feeling naturally exiting in the minds
of the people of this country against Great Bntam,
from whom we had just severed ourselves by a
long, obstinate and bloody war, and jn favc of
Prance who had aided us m the struggle, arous'-d
the deepest suspicion and exposed to popu'ar odium
the man who was loi ked upon as the Pi-f'era1
leader in this country, the most determined friend
to ihe principles of neutrality, and ihe met reso-
lute enemy to the progress of the Prench power.
His opinions and his course upon a question wh ch
convulsed and divided the world, was cocdet* n*d
by the voice of a majority of his countiymen, that
decision accomplished the entire overthiow of ras
party, and has darkened ihe posthumous fame of
one whom the Dcmoei at c party dreaded rr>ore
than all the world beside 'ihe positions la-
ken by him in legard to a navy and to a Bank of
the United Stitpb, and o Her kindred mq&snrc ,
were formed m the school of that slaveholder who ■>
sacred dust was now reposing wi hm the si ll of
his native Virginia, and on the banks o his own onee-
loved Potomac Against the hated head of this
illustrious man, the whole ihunder of a victon >us
and triumphant party had long been hiHed, nor
did they cease till the hand of one no v branded on
his country's history as a traitor, in an evil honr,
had laid him low. Whatever might have been the
errors of that greit statesman, it would be b¿rd 'o

mon*, the wild projects and headstrong purposes of
th"se wno des red to slnke at the Union, tha1 the
true design of the whole movement hud been i
tai nnphaut defence and vindication of the Ameri-
can Union, and such a reproof to those who asked
it- ds ^ruction as shoull forever real their lips in
sdence; the pioduction of an argument which
should at orce satisfy all the world, and put down
M one and forever all such destructive designs as
had «ivn birth to tins memorial This had. in

he had so much as breathed ^uch a wibh as had

f-om Virginia, [Mr Bott ,] it would have had
«uch an effect on the feelings of Mr 1V1 as might

v ob  u defence which had been set up for such a
document?   Two points had bten made   first, the
gentleman insisted upon the right of these petitioned
to do this thing    They had a natural right te diS.
solve the Government, and to sever the Union «f* ,
these States whenever that Union should, m  their'
opinion, be injurious or inconvenient to themselvesv*
And then, in the second place, that this right was^f
nugatory and of no value unless they might peii--i|
tion Congress to effect such dissolution.    What aid
this argument prove?   That the American Govern-
ment cannot be abolished by  the American peo-
ple without their asking Congress to do it    This
was the body which must destroy the Union, if iV
was to  be des royed  at all.    So much as to the
matter ot ngh*
And then the gentleman, as the next step of his
argument, had gone on to enumerate the griev-
ances whieh led tho-e people to desire a dissolution*
of the Union, and the grievances were almost wh.
out number Mr. M would go over a few of th$
heads of complaint, by way of contrast to the state-
ment made by the gentleman from Virginia, [tip,
Botts,] as to the object and motive of the gentle-
man in bringing that petition to the Hose, wbichi

man had taken the position that that portion of the
Union from which Mr. M. cams were trying, with >
all the influence they could exert, to effect a repeal
of the act of habeas corpus, and of the trial by ju-
ry, that they were industriously endeavoring to
ex'end the existence of slavery over ihe freeStates;
that they sought io involve this country in a wat
with Great Britain, with a new to restore the Afri-
can slave trade, and to fix it upon these States
forever, and that the project of the Secretary of the
Navy for ihe establishment of a home squad on
had for its real object, not ihe 'defence of the coun-
try, but the protee ion of the slave trade'. And
then, after enumeiatini a 1 these difieren t grounds
of grievance, ihe gentleman had warned the House
that he should go home to his people, and say to
them th t it was time to uke the alarm, that he
wou'dgive them the alarm, and that he had nitro- \
duced th s petition for the very purpo e of exciting
alarm.
Mr ADA"V13 interposed, and den'ed that he had
slid this, or any thing like it. What he had said
was, «hat he Kid presented the pcluion brcau'e he
considered  t h,s duty.
