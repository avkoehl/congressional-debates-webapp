APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
3 1st Cong 2d Sess.
Report of the Secretary of the Interior.
Senate & Ho. of Reps.
The series of measures to winch I have alluded "j outset, this was probably the most judicious course,
are regarded by me as a settlement, in principle as experience is generally the best guide in the
and substanceâ€”a final settlement of the dangerous ; adjustment of such matters. But it would seem
and exciting subjects which they embraced. Most
of these subjects, indeed, are beyond your reach,
as the legislation which disposed of them was, in
its character, final and irrevocable. It may be
presumed from the opposition which they all en-
countered, that none of those measures was free
from imperfections, but in their mutual depend-
ence and connection they formed a system of com-
promise, the most conciliatory ana best for the
entire country, that could be obtained from conflict-
ing sectional interests and opinions. .
For this reason I recommend your adherence to
the adjustment established by those measures
until time and experience shall demonstrate the
necessity of further legislation to guard against
evasion or abuse. -
By that adjustment we have been rescued from
the wide and boundless agitation that surrounded
us, and have a firm, distinct, and legal ground to
rest upon. And the occasion, I trust, will justify
me in exhorting my countrymen to rally upon and
maintain that ground as the best, if not the only
means, of restoring peace and quiet to the coun-
try, and maintaining inviolate the integrity of the
Union.
And now, fellow-citizens, I cannot bring this
communication to a close without invoking you to
join me in humble and devout thanks to the Great
Ruler of nations, for the multiplied blessings which
he has graciously bestowed upon us. His hand,
so often visible in pur preservation, has stayed the
pestilence, saved us from foreign wars and do-
mestic disturbances, and scattered-plenty through-
out the land.
Our liberties, religious and civil, have been main-
tained; the fountains of knowledge have all been
kept op^i, and means of happiness widely spread'
ana generally enjoyed, greater than have fallen to
the lot of*any other nation. And, while deeply
penetrated with gratitude for the past, let us hope
that his all-wise Providence will so guide our
counsels, as that they shall result in giving satis-
faction to our constituents, securing the peace of
the country, and adding new strength to the united
Government under which we live.

"Washington, December 2, 1850.
Report of the Secretary of the Interior.
Department op the Interior,
December 2, 1850.
r Sir: The duties which have been devolved by law
on the Department of the Interior are of the most
varied and important character. As the name of
the Department would imply, they relate to most
of the interests of the country which are of a do- j
mestic nature. They embrace not only a variety !
of subjects, but the duties to be performed are j
widely dissimilar, and partake in some degree of '
a legislative and judicial, as well as of an execu-
tive character. i
To this Department is intrusted the general su- |j
pervision and management of all matters connected 11
with the Public Domain, Indian Affairs, Pensions, j
Patentv, Public Buildings, the Census, the Peni- l|
tentiary, and the expenditures of the Judiciary.
It is the duty of die person in charge of it to ![
see to the faithful administration of the laws rela- I
ting to these several branches of the public ser- '
vice, and to prescribe such regulations as may be
necessary to give full effect to the legislative will. 1
And in addition to these functions of an execu- ,
tive and legislative character, he is required by ;
law to act in a-judicial capacity, and to decide
all cases of appeal which may be brought before
him for adjudication from any of the bureaux in his
Department. Many of these appeals, especially
from the Pension, Land, and Indian Offices, are
of ffreat importance in a pecuniary point of view,
ana involve the examination of voluminous rec-
ords, and the investigation and decision of intri-
cate questions of law and equity.
The act of Congress which created the Depart-
ment was drawn up, probably by design, in very
general terms. Many of its provisions are ex-
ceedingly vague, and there seems to have been no
attempt to define with precision the boundaries of
its jurisdiction or the extent of its powers. In the
to be proper now that there should be more defi-
nite legislation prescribing the duties and powers
of the Department, so that there may be no con-
flict with other Departments, and little or nothing
left to the mere discretion of the incumbent.
My predecessor, in his annual report, called
your attention to the incongruity in the law in ref-
erence to the designation of the Department. In
the title of the act it is styled a " Home Depart-
ment," but the body of the law provides that it
shall be called " The Department of the Interior."
The late incumbent, under whose auspices the De-
partment was organized, felt himself bound by the
mandatory terms of the law to adopt the latter des-
ignation in all his official acts, but it is obviously
proper that Congress should, by supplemental le-
gislation, remove the ambiguity and uncertainty
on this subject.
My predecessor also recommended, for reasons
very clearly and forcibly stated by him in his re-
port, to which I respectfully refer, the creation of
the office of Solicitor of the Department of the In-
terior, to be filled by a lawyer competent to in-
vestigate and decide maify of the important ques-
tions of law aud fact arising upon the numerous
appeals which are taken from the bureaux. My
brief experience in the administration of the De-
partment enables me to appreciate the wisdom of
that recommendation, and to urge its speedy adop-
tion by Congress. In all cases, however, the
action of the Solicitor should be subject to the re-
vision of the head of the Department, for nothing
should be done to diminish in the slightest degree
his official responsibility.
As the reports of the heads of the several bu-
reaux will give full information in regard to their
condition and wants respectively, and as I have
not been long enough m office to make myself
thoroughly acquainted with all the details of their
organization and functions, I do not deem it either
necessary or proper, at this time, to give more
than a general review of their operations, with
such explanations and suggestions as the public
, interests seem to require.
As preliminary to this review, I respectfully
submit in tabular form a summary of the estimates
for each branch of the public service within the ju-
| risdiction of this office. In a distinct column, and
1 opposite to each item, is a statement of the esti-
! mate for the present fiscal year for similar services.
This comparison seems to be proper, as it will ex-
j hibit to the representatives of the people at a single
, glance a view ofthe whole subject, and at the same
time afford me the opportunity of presenting, by a
succinct commentary on each item, such explana-
tions as I desire to offer.

Excess over last estimates $1,728,670 63. I
The first fact which strikes the mind upon look-
ing at this recapitulation is, that the estimate for
the next fiscal year exceeds that for the present '
$1,728,670 63.
Faithful guardians of the public Treasury wil]
naturally inquire how does this happen? The
question demands a candid answer, and I shall
proceed to give one which I hope will be no less :
satisfactory than free from all attempt at conceal- |
ment or disguise.
department proper.
Under this head the estimate for the next year j
falls below that for the present $44,097 68. This ;
results from .the fact that there is no deficiency ],
of a previous year to be provided for. Last year 11
there was a deficiency of $34,737 68 to be met.
Now there are unexpended balances on hand
which, in addition to the sum estimated, will sup-
ply the wants of the Department.
land service.
The estimates under this head exceed those of
last year $157,118 29. This is cyised by the in-
crease of expense consequent on the passage ot
the act of 28th September, v1850, granting bounty
land; by the contemplated extension of the land
system over the newly-acquired territory; and by
the deficiencies in the estimates of the last fiscal
year.
indian affairs.
Here there is an excess over the estimates of
last year of $1,423,033 49. A reference to the
report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs will
show that whilst many of the items embraced in
the former estimate have been reduced or omitted
in the present, the aggregate of the present esti-
mate has been increased by making provision for
deficiencies, which was not done in the estimate
of last year, and by embracing large sums neces-
sary to carry into effect new treaty stipulations,
and to extend our Indian relations into new Ter-
j ritories, in pursuance of recent acts of Congress.
; Some idea may be formed of the magnitude of
jr these latter items when it is remembered that our
ji Indian population has been almost doubled by
N our recent acquisitions of territory from Mexico.
pension office.
In this item there is also an apparent excess of
startling magnitude. It exceeds the estimate of
last year #1,145,469 53. But a little examination
will show that it is to a great extent merely ap-
parent, and that so far as it is real, it results from
causes over which the Executive officers could
exercise no control, and which are entirely con-
sistent with the true interests of the country.
These positions are susceptible of ready demon-
stration, as I will proceed in a few words to show.
The estimate of last year fell short of the actual
expenditures of the bureau, including the deficien-
cies of the preceding year, $924,688 45. This
deficiency was supplied by the appropriation of
$560,000 in the " deficiency bill" of last session
of Congress, and by $364,688 45, which sum is
embraced in the present estimate. Adding these
sums to the estimate of last year, and the aggre-
gate is $2,403,945 23. Then deduct from the
I estimate of next year $364,688 45, which amount
is asked for to supply the deficiency of the pres-
j ent year, and which is not properly chargeable to
i the next, and the true amount of the estimated
} expenditure of the Pension Bureau for the rnsu-
I ing year is ascertained to be $2,260,037 87, or
! $143,907 37 less than the actual expenditure of
I the current year, including the deficiency' of
$560,000 for 1850.
This mode of stating the account, however,
although it exhibits a true comparison of the pres-
ent estimates with the actual expenditure* of the
| current year, does-not present a fair view of the
' amounts legitimately cnargeable to the Pension
I Bureau for the two years respectively, because it
embraces among the expenditures of the year end-
ing June 30, 1851, $560,000, which was a de-
ficiency in the year 1850. Discarding that sum
from the calculation, the result is as follows:

tration ofthe bounty land law so far as it devolves
on the Pension Office.
