RICHMOND, VA., April 5, 1862.

Governor BROWN,

Savannah:

SIR: I regret extremely the interference with your arms; will use every exertion to recover and restore them, or to return others of equal value. The arms sent to Richmond were many of them stopped at Raleigh and turned aside to Goldsborough, for the purpose of arming three Georgia regiments called for by General Lee. It may be that those were your arms.

I have instructed General Pemberton to call on you for an invoice or other description of the arms, and to return them out of the first parcel received. If they cannot be replaced, they can be paid for. I have cautioned Colonel Dilworth, at Tallahassee, against using any State arms, and will cause any officer to be punished who knowingly takes them.

GEO. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.
HDQRS. TENTH Regiment S. C. V., C. S. P. A., Second Military District, Mount Pleasant, April 5, 1862.

Captain J. R. WADDY,Assistant Adjutant-General, Headquarters, Pocotaligo:

CAPTAIN: By permission of General Ripley, to whom I reported on my arrival here from Georgetown with my command, the Tenth Regiment, I have the honor to report that the instructions received from the general commanding have been executed. The redoubts in the First Military District have been abandoned; the guns, 20 in number, dismounted, and are now on their way by railroad to Charleston, with ammunition, ordnance stores, &amp;c. Logs of wood resembling pieces of ordnance have been mounted in the place of each gun that has been removed, and three companies of cavalry and three of infantry are encamped near them; the positions have the appearance of being still occupied. The troops cannot be cut off by any but a land attack, against which only ordinary precaution will be necessary.
