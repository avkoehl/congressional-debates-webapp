Brigadier General C. S. HAMILTON, Holly Springs, Miss.:

The cavalry Leed not start to-night, if not already started. Their camp equipage is all ordered to Abbeville, where they will remain until further orders.

You may retain Lee's cavalry with you. Open communication with the north, if possible, and get information from Corinth. I telegraphed you instructions to-day to send one division to Holly Springs and one to Waterford. I will give Quinby instructions here.

You need not move from position indicated here without further directions.

General GRANT:

Van Dorn went to Salem; then to Davis' Mill, where he was repulsed; then down south bank Wolf to Moscow. He pulled up some rails near Davis' Mill. He started north from Moscow at 3 o'clock this morning. All right at Corinth. I think I will send a brigade to Salem to head Van Dorn.
