SAINT LOUIS, November 15, 1864-10.54 p. m.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT,

Washington, D. C.:

While awaiting details of the campaign, I deem it my duty to say that abundant evidence accumulates to show that Price's invasion had the greatest designs-no less than turning the election in this State for McClellan, preventing it in Kansas, and, by the aid of insurrectionists here and O. A. K.'s from Illinois and Indiana, the occupation of it till the new Administration should come in. For the complete failure of this scheme Major-General Pleasonton, by his gallantry and skill in handling our cavalry in pursuit and action, the country is so largely indebted that I most respectfully recommend him for promotion to the vacant brigadiership in the Regular Army.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
