(Received 11 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington:

Our loss in killed, wounded, and missing in the attack on our picket-line the night of the 5th proves to be only twenty. Deserters from that portion of the enemy's line making the attack say theirs was about 200. Our captures were forty-two prisoners and some entrenching tools. The enemy have asked permission to bury their dead under flag.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I have nothing of consequence to report, all having been quiet during the past twenty-four hours. A deserter, who came into the Second Corps lines, estimates the enemy's loss in the affair of night before last as about 200. Major-General Hancock reports his loss in killed, wounded, and missing as under twenty.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Lieutenant-General Anderson has applied to Major-General Hancock for a flag of truce for an hour or two bury the dead lying between the lines. It will hardly be practicable to have one this evening; but, with your permission, authority can be given to Hancock to arrange one to-morrow morning.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.

CITY POINT, November 7, 1864.

Major-General MEADE:

Lieutenant-General Grant approves your proposal in reference to a flag of truce for burying the dead.
