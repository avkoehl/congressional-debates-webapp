bers of my volunteer and regular staff I return my thanks for their services. Captain James Wood, the hero of the La Mine, deserves a high position for his cool daring.

The fight at Marshall lasted about five hours, and was hot and desperate. The loss of the Federals I have no exact means of knowing; but from the statements of prisoners and citizens, coupled with the fact of their weak pursuit, it must have been very severe. I fought there 8,000 men, aided by twelve pieces of artillery, in their own chosen position, with troops from Kansas, Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Missouri; was surrounded; cut my way out without losing a wagon; beat them back in every charge they made upon my rear, and I finally eluded them altogether.

I have traveled 1,500 miles, and found the people of Missouri, as a mass, true to the South and her institutions, yet needing the strong presence of a Confederate army to make them volunteer. The southern, southwestern, and some of the middle counties of Missouri are completely desolated. In many places for 40 miles not a single habitation is to be found, for on the road we met delicate females fleeing southward, driving ox teams, barefooted, ragged, and suffering for even bread.

Here, before closing my report, I will recapitulate the chief events of the raid:

Number of Federals killed and wounded....................... 600

Number of Federals captured and paroled..................... 500

Number of forts captured and destroyed, 10; at an aggregate

cost of....................................................$120,000

Amount of railroad property destroyed, consisting of rails, ties, tanks, cattle-stops, telegraph wire and poles, bridges and piers......................................................$800,000

Number of guns captured.................................... 600

Number of stand of colors taken............................ 40

Number of revolvers........................................ 600

Number of wagons captured and destroyed.................... 300

Number of horses and mules captured........................ 6,000

Amount of supplies used and destroyed...................... .........................................................$1,000,000

Pieces of artillery taken................................ 1

Number of recruits gained................................ 800

Amount of ordnance captured and destroyed (reduced to cost..$50,000

My entire number of killed and wounded on the trip will not exceed 150. Besides the damage thus inflicted, I kept [from] re-enforcing Rosecrans (then terribly defeated by General Bragg) at least 10,000 men, for two weeks. The raid lasted forty-one days, and in traveling the 1,500 miles I averaged over 36 miles per day.

Hoping this report may prove satisfactory, I remain, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JO. O. SHELBY,

Colonel, Commanding Expedition.

Major L. A. MACLEAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Price's Division.
