SEPTEMBER 18, 1863-2.30 p.m.

General ROSECRANS:

Steedman has just returned to camp. Report is now on the way to your headquarters. Went to Graysville and Ringgold. Scoot's brigade of rebel cavalry moved in two columns toward La Fayette and Dalton upon his approaching. Minty is at Reed's Brigade.

G. GRANGER,

Major-General.

Brig. General JAMES A. GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: General Steedman has just returned. He moved by the way of Graysville to Ringgold, reaching the latter-named place at 5 p.m. He saw what, from the best information he could gather, was supposed to be Scott's brigade of rebel cavalry, which made but little resistance, but moved off in two columns-one to the southwest toward La Fayette, the other to the southeast toward Dalton, the transportation moving toward La Fayette. He encamped at Battle Springs. Six shells were thrown into his camp about 10 p.m., but no one hurt. Moving from the north upon them led them to believe that the troops were the advance of Burnside's column. Inclosed please find notes from Colonel Minty. The brigade he speaks of as Spear's having passed through Graysville to Ringgold was undoubtedly Steedman.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. GRANGER,

Major-General.

Captain RUSSELL,

Asst. Adjt. General, Reserve Corps:

SIR: I have to acknowledge receipt of your dispatch of this a.m. Pegram's pickets were about 9 miles up the Pea Vine Valley yesterday evening. A brigade of infantry, reported by the citizens to be Spear's, passed Graysville toward Ringgold yesterday forenoon, and cannonading was heard a little north of Ringgold yesterday p.m. I have sent strong scouts up the valley and toward Ringgold. If anything of importance is learned from them I will advise General Granger by special courier.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. H. G. MINTY,

Colonel, Commanding.

SIR: The scout which I sent to Ringgold this a.m. has been driven back, and is followed by the enemy apparently in force. They appear to be pushing toward left and rear.
