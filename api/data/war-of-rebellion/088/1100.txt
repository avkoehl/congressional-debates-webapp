HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, September 29, 1864. (Received 6.45 a.m.)

General WILLIAMS:

The enemy made an attack with 200 or 300 men on left of picket-line First Division last night, but accomplished nothing but the capture of one man, who afterward escaped. One man of Twenty-eight Massachusetts deserted to the enemy this morning. He cannot know much, except as to issue of ammunition,&amp;c. The First Division picked heard infantry and artillery moving in the night, but were unable to ascertain the nature of the movement. General Mott, Third Division, thought last night that the enemy had taken up their second line in his front, holding their first with a thin line, but could not ascertain anything definite. He could see one gun in the large fort immediately in front of Fort Sedgwick.

The enemy are reported as forming a line behind the fort opposite Fort Stedman. The information comes from Colonel Lynch,commanding brigade of First Division. The information is not sufficiently definite to give me much apprehension of an attack. I am having the matter examined.
