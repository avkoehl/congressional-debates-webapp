THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 5,
tion will take its place among the other bills to be
acted on by the House.
Mr. HENDRICKS. I hope the gentleman
from Virginia will not make objection to the read-
ing of the report. He would understand it in one
minute. I would not press the matter, but that
I cannot be here when the bill would come up in
its regular order.
Mr. LETCHER. I understand that; but I do
not consider that that is any good reason for the
House to go now into the merits of the bill.
Mr. HENDRICKS. If the gentleman from
Virginia will allow the report to be read, I know
that he, or any other member, will make no objec-
tion to the passage of the bill.
Mr. ORR. I understood the gentleman to say
he was not going to put any bill upon its pas-
sage.
Mr. LETCHER. I move the report be referred
to the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union, and printed.
The question was put, and the motion was
agreed to.
Mr. HENDRICKS, from the same committee,
also made adverse reports in the following cases;
which were ordered to lie on the table, and be
printed:
On the petition of E. P. Hastings, for compen-
sation as pension agent at Detroit from 1836 to
1846;
Petition of James M. French, of the city and
State of New York, for an invalid pension on ac-
count of disabilities received in the last war with
Great Britain;
Petition of Levi Colmus, praying that a pension

was placed on the pension roll;
Petition of Hiram Cook and others, heirs of

1843, when his pension commenced;

of 1819, praying for a pension;

relief; and
Petition of Robert H. Stevens, for a pension
for services in the United States Army in 1840.
EXPENSES OF ROGUE RIVER INDIAN WAR.
Mr. LANE, of Oregon. I ask the unanimous
consent of the House to offer a resolution of in-
quiry only.
The resolution was read for information, as
follows:
Resolved, That the Secretary of War bo requested to
transmit to this Ilou-o such estimates lor muster rolls and
vouchers appertaininu to the expenses incurred in the late
war witil the Rogue llivor Indiana, as may be in hia pos-
session, with such recommendation as he may deem right
and proper.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I do not de-
sire to object to the gentleman's resolution, but 1
desire to say to the Delegate from Oregon, that it
will do no good to pass the resolution. Calls
were made upon the Secretary of War for inform-
ation two months ago,and,as yet, no information
has been given, lie has paid no attention to the
calls.
Mr. LANE. I would say to the gentleman
that I know the Secretary of War well enough to
know that he will act promptly, if the resolution
is passed; and i hope it will not be objected to.
Mr. WASHBURNE. I do not object to its
introduction.
There being no objection, the resolution was in-
troduced and passed.
REV. JAMES COOK RICHARDSON.
Mr. SEWARD asked and obtained unanimous
consent to introduce the following resolution;
which was read, and agreed to:
Resolved, That the President of the United States fur-
nish to this House copies of alt the correspondence which
â€¢ has passed between the United States Charge d'Affaires at
Vienna, Austria, and the State Department, in regard to the
case of the Rev. James Oook Richardson ; also, all the cor-
respondence which has passed between the same m regard
to the rejection of the exequator upon the commission of
the United States Consul appointed for Trieste.
Mr. COBB. I now call for the regular older
of business.
The SPEAKER. The first business in order
is the call of committees for reports, commencing
with the Committee on the Post Office and Post
Roads.
REPORTS FROM THE COMMITTEE ON THE
POST OFFICE AND POST ROADS.
Mr. OLDS, from the Committee on the Post
Office and Post Roads, reported a bill of the fol-
lowing title; which was read a first and second
time by its title, and referred to the Committee of
the Whole on the state of the Union, and ordered
to be printed:
A bill to provide for the appointment of a Fourth
Assistant Postmaster General, and for other pur-
poses.
Also, reported back without amendment, Senate
bill (No. 247) " for the relief of Zadoc C. Ingra-
ham," with a recommendation that it do pass;
which was read, and referred to the Committee of
the Whole on the state of the Union.
Mr. OLDS. The committee have also directed
me to report the following joint resolution, to
which I ask the attention of the House, as J pro-
pose to move to put it upon its passage.
The resolution was read by its title, as follows:
Joint resolution explanatory of the second sec-
tion of the resolution to establish certain post
routes, approved July 12, 1852.
The resolution was then read in extenso.
Mr. OLDS, If the House will listen to me for
one minute, I think 1 can satisfy them of the
necessity there is for the passage of this resolu-
tion. It is a matter of very small importance, so
far as the amount is 6oncerned, involving perhaps
not more than one hundred dollars. The last
Congress passed a resolution providing for paying
for the services rendered upon the mail route re-
cited in the resolution; but by the reading of the
resolution the Postmaster General construed it as
authorizing the payment of the service only up to
the time of the passage of the resolution. But
the service was rendered during the time of the
advertising, which took place in consequence of
its becoming a post route, up to the time of the
regular letting under the law; and the object of
this bill is to provide for the payment for that ser-
vice. This resolution provides for the payment
from the time of the passage of the resolution to
which I have alluded up to the time of the regular
letting of route. With this explanation I leave the
resolution to the House, trusting that it will be
passed.
The resolution was then ordered to be engrossed
and read third a time; and having been engrossed,
was accordingly read the third time, and passed.
Mr. OLDS. I suppose, in accordance with the
usual custom, I must make the motion that the
vote by which the resolution passed be reconsid-
ered, and that the motion to reconsider be laid
upon the table.
The question was taken; and the latter motion
agreed to.
Mr. GREY, from the Committee on the Post
Office and Post Roads, reported the following bills;
which were read a first and second time by their
titles, referred to the Committee of the Whole
House, made the order of the dayfor to-morrow,
and ordered to be printed:
A bill for the benefit of J. C. Buckles, of Louis-
ville, Kentucky; and
A bill for the benefit of McAttee & Eastham.
Mr. McDOUGALL, from theCommitteeon the
Post Office and Post Roads, reported the follow-
ing bill; which was read a first and second time
by its title, referred to a Committee of the Whole
House, made the order of the day for to-morrow,
and ordered to be printed:
A bill for the relief of James S. Graham and
Walker H. Finnall.
TRANSPORTATION OF CALIFORNIA MAIL.
Mr. McDOUGALL also reported the following
bill; which was read a first and second time by
its title:
A bill to empower the Postmaster General to
contract for the transportation of the United States
mail from New Orleans to San Francisco accord-
ing to time.
Mr. CHURCH WELL. I desire to ask, if it
be the pleasure of the House, to put that bill upon
its passage. .1 ask that it may be read through,
after which I propose to make some explanation
of its provisions.
The original bill was then read, as follows:
