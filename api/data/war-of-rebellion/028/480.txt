Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

I have seen Governor Curtin. I have ordered a section of artillery to report to him without delay, with ammunition, and put an infantry regiment of Pennsylvania volunteers, now on the Northern Central Railroad, subject to his call at any moment. This is all he requires of me. He wants regular infantry. I have none to give him, and have no troops that have been under fire.
