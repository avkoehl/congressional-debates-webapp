to be countenanced on that floor     lie concluded*
by moving to strike out the enacting clause of the
bill
Mr SUTHERLAND said, some six or seven
years ago this claim was before the House He
then examined it, and was fully convinced that it
was founded in justice, and advocated it accord-
ipo-ly From furthei examination he still retained
the same opmion, and would again support it
He remembered, also, that the gentleman from
Tennessee [Mr Folk] had opDosed the bill on
the former occasion Mi S said he would briefly
remark in relation to one of the argumentsjof the
gent'eman from Kentucky [Mr Hirdi\] against
the Ameucan citizenship of Mr Meade, that this
point, during the whole discussion, had never
been questiored He was the American consul
at Cadiz, and both Spain and the United States
had, on all occasions, conceded the fact, that he
was an American citizen But Mr S said he
advocated the bill on other ground It was not a
bill to direct the payment of the claim It did not
even refer it to the adjudication of the Supreme
Court No, it was to be placed in the hands of
your own officer for investigation It was to be
sent to the Attorney General, and two auditor?
to be designated by the President He asked if
there was a man on that floor who doubted that
Mr Meade had a just claim, without reference to
its amount5 He did not believe there was It
nad not, indeed, heretofore been denied The
Government, Mr S contended, was solemnly
bound to permit this examination He explained
the íeason why ihe onginal vouchers were not
produced to the commissioners, when they were
investigating these claims They were not sup-
posed, at first, to be essential, and when they
were founu to be so, it was too late to procure
them from Spam in time for the investigation,
though every exertion was made to do so A/id
because the neiebsary evidence could not be pro-
cured in a spec fie time, did it become the dignity
and honor of that House to now plead the statute
of limitation against an honest claim* Mr. S
said the present Secretary of Stale [Mr Forsyth]
was our Minister to Spam at the time the facts in
question transpired, and was well acquainted with
all the circumstances involved That gentleman,
while a member of the Senate, had introduced a
bill for the allowance or Mr Meade's claim He
would present tl is fact against all the learned
argument that might be advanced on the subject
He asked if gen'lemen were afraid to have this
claim examined by impartial men of their own
choice
After some fut'her eneigetie remarks, m the
couise of which he adverted to the sufferings of
Mr Meade in a Spanish felon's prison, in which
he coi traded a disease which final'y bore him
fiom this world to another, Mr S reiterated his
so emn belief thit this was a just and honest
claim He did not pietend to determine what
should be its precise amount, but appealed to the
House to suffer thit point to be examined -Let
u«, said he, go into it w. ith clean hands and a puie
beait, and give to the widow and the orphan their
just due
Mr ARCHER next took the floor in favor of
the bill, and after addiessing the House some fif
teen minu es, on his motion the committee rose,
icpoited progiegs,and obtained leave to sit again,
when,

The bill granting two per cent of the proceeds
of sales of public lands in Alabama, set apait for
purposes of public improvement, to purposes of
education within that State, was taken up for con-
sideration as in Committee of the Whole
A protracted and discursive debate ensued upon
this bill, which was participated in more or less
by Messrs MOORE, WEBSTER, POINDEX-
TER, FRELINGHUYSEN, and PRENTISS,
who suppoited the bill, and by Messrs KING, of
Georgia, KING, of Alabama, KANE, PORTER,
and BLACK, who opposed it
Mr MOORE explained the principles of the
bill, the object of which, he said, was to change
the destination of the proceeds of sales which had
been set apart for the construction of roads, to
purposes of education, in Alabama He com-
mented at length upon the necessity of promoting;
and fostering education, that the fund allowed pro-
posed to be thus applied, amounted now to about
jll5 000, but that it was not proposed to change
us destination without the assent of Alabama
Mr KING, of Georgia, thought the bill a most
extiaoidmaiy one It proposed, virtually, that
the uch and respectable State of Alabama should
become a charity scholar to the Government of
the Union This two per cent fund, he said,
was as much the money of the nation, for the
purposes foi which it was originally destined, as
any other money in the Treasury The principie
of pouring out the money and property of the
Union for the exclusive use of the new States
was oiigmally wrong, and became more and more
so as these States continued to progress in wealth
and population
He thought these nui slings of ours—these minois
of the Confederacy—had been in the nurseiylong
enough, and he, foi one, was disposed to wean
them as early as possible.at least he was very much
