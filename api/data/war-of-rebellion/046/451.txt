HEADQUARTERS MORRIS ISLAND,September 1, 1863.

CAPTAIN: The enemy were quiet again last night and busily engaged on their works. Under cover of the darkness, they succeeded in advancing their lines a short distance. A brisk fire was kept up from Wagner all night upon the front of the works, where the enemy were engaged. At daylight, the enemy opened fire upon Wagner with their mortars, and have been keeping up a fire at intervals during the day.

They also commenced fire on Sumter with their heavy land batteries, which was continued until this evening. The chief of artillery reports that the 32-pounder howitzer in the salient is still disabled.

Wheels were sent over for the carriage, but unfortunately did not fit. More wheels should be sent immediately, as the gun is a very important one. The two 8-inch shell guns on the land face are also partially disabled. From the guns and howitzers, 203 shots were fired in the last twenty-four hours, and from the mortars, 61 shells.

The disposition of the troops is the same as in last report.

Respectfully submitted.

A. H. COLQUITT,

Brigadier-General.

Captain W. F. NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
