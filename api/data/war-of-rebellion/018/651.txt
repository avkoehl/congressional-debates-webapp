in that quarter? We rely upon you for requisite information to send trains and material by prompt movements where the force of the enemy shall be so great as to prevent their preservation by our troops. You have doubtless noted the success which has attended our arrangements in the movements of General Cox's forces.

President.

ALEXANDRIA, August 24, 1862-3 p.m. (Received 3.30 p.m.)

General H. W. HALLECK:

In compliance with orders received at Aquia Creek I report my arrival here. My infantry has begun to arrive and will be here entirely to-morrow. I have ordered its disembarkation and encampment on the railroad outside of town. I shall report to you in person in obedience to orders from General McClellan.

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major-General.

AUGUST 24, 1862-2 p.m.

Generals MORELL and SYKES:

Push a scout to Rappahannock Station, and find out if Pope has the pickets near there and gain information of Pope or the enemy. Pope attacked the enemy yesterday near Sulphur Springs and the latter retreated; he was to renew the attack to-day, and it is probable Pope was pushing after him. I know the river at Rappahannock was not fordable. General Halleck's orders are for us to hold the Rappahannock. Your artillery is en route; also Sykes'. You will therefore carry out your former instructions. Re-enforcements will push up to you. All goes right.

F. J. PORTER,

Major-General.

FALMOUTH, August 24, 1862.

Generals MORELL and SYKES:

Keep your commands well on hand for any emergency, and before advancing another step do your utmost to ascertain the positions of Pope's forces and where the enemy is. What force is at Kelly's Ford? Has the enemy been seen on the opposite bank? Give me all the information you have, and the location of your forces, and amount of cavalry at the ford. There is no more cavalry here to send you. If you can push scouts over the ford, do so as far as possible. What is the latest information?

Send your dispatches so that General Sykes can see them. Direct Griffin to fix the ground or woods at Barnett's so that a small force, with artillery, can hold it. I am just informed that Pope is on the Rappahannock, at Warrenton Springs, having attacked and whipped the enemy. I wish to hold Kelly's Ford to-morrow, and hope by the time I join you that you will be able to inform me what is at and opposite Rappahannock Station.

F. J. PORTER,

Major-General.
