The Tariff—Mr. Maynard.
Ho, op Reps.
gradually lost their power upon the popular
mind in these great States? This increase has
appeared in the productions of iron, steel, cot-
ton, silk; indeed, in almost every branch of
ntfflWffactrires fin" none, perhaps, more "than in
woolens.,
One of my mercantile friends in this city
handed me the. other day when passing some
samples—interesting from the locality of their
production ; I do not know whether the gentle-
man from Kentucky [Mr. Beck] will call them
factures or manufactures—of woolen cloths
from the flharlottsville woolen mills at Char
lottsville, Virginia, at prices ranging from eighty
cents to $1 50 a yard, with six per cent, off to
wholesale purchasers. I ask gentlemen to
examine their quality and character. A dis-
tinguished Virginian, formerly in this House,
declared himself willing to go a long way to
kick a sheep. Here is a flannel made by an
establishment in the Shenandoah valley and
sold to wholesale purchasers at seventy cents
per yard; and another flannel, made by the
Aniina Society of the State of Iowa—and some
gentleman from that State will be able to tell
the exact locality—which is sold at the same
price. Those fabrics twelve- years ago we
depended on the importer to lay at out doors.
Wool at that time wa3 free. By the tariff of
1867 we put a comparatively small duty on it..
What is the result? Not only has our wool
product increased more than twofold, or from
00,511,343 pounds in 1860 to 163,000,000
pounds in 1§70, but see how the importation
of wool has increased during'the last twelve
months.
In 1870 there were fifty-one million of
pounds imported, while during the last year,
the calendar year of 1871_, the importation
amounted to eighty-seven millions, This is the
way your business, your agricultural produc-
tions, your manufacturing industries, your
commercial enterprises are increased in a
ratio that the country had never seen before.
But the enormous tariff and the burdens of
taxation are higher, we are told, than any-
where else on the globe. This I deny, and
append the tariffs of England and France in
disproof. (Appendix D.) Who is crying out
for reduction of the tariff? Who are the men
calling on us to relieve this burden of taxa-
tion? They are not manufacturers. They are
not merchants. They are not sellers in the
market, or buyers. They toil not; neither
do they spin; but they haunt the purlieus of
the Capitol, sending off communications to
the ends of the country, denouncing the tariff,
denouncing protection, denouncing the men
who are supposed to favor it, holding up even
accidental personal defects of childhood to
obloquy, slander, and ridicule. Nothing at-
tempted in behalf of American labor, Ameri-
can production, American independence of
foreign nations for the necessaries of the public
defense, or the comforts of life, escapes their
censure. Every domestic industry is assailed
as a common enemy, and the enterprising pro-
prietor is subject to ceaseless denunciations.
Monopolists, with every added epithet, thatcan
give increased odium; cotton lord's, iron lords,
and whatever else that is haiteful, are the
habitual designation of the tailing artisan,
if of the manufacturer class, which disfigure
many of the printed documents in .the interest
of what is called free trade. What is the
source bf this inspiration ? Prom whab-foun-
tains flow these bitter waters ?
Who pays these men? Upon what meatsdo
they feed? Whence do they derive their daily
bread ? Perchance there are not many of them
here just now. In a western citjr you might find
them in. numbers: to-day, trying"to make a
presidential candidate for the Democratic party.
But who are they? What interest do they
represent? Whence come they? Letmeread
a paragraph, Mr. Chairman, from a recent
letter of the venerable Peter Cooper—
'* Whose head is silvered o'ttftittragW - '
And long experience made hiui sage
"There are thousands of those now engaged in for-
eign trade whose fortunes depend on filling the
country with foreign goods. There are other thou-
sands who are holders of mortgages, who hope to
buy in the property for the face of their mortgages,
or for halt its present value. And that they will do as
soon as they can induce our Government to try an-
other experiment in what they call free trade. The
policy of these persons, who are all clamorous for free
tra.de, would deprive millions of men ot their means
of living by mechanical employments,and drive them
into competition with the farming and agricultural
interests of the country, making the mechanics com-
petitors of the farmers, instead of consuming, as they
now do, ten times as much of the agricultural pro-
duct of the country as is now sold in all Europe."
That states the whole case. The very arti-
cles that are struck at in the bill of the major-
ity are the articles which we import most largely
and principally from Great Britain—your iron,
wool, cotton, copper, earthenware, &c. It is
notable that there should be such a coinci-
dence between the interests of our great man-
ufacturing rival and the provisions of this bill.
Let me before concluding advert to one
point more to show the general prosperity of
the country—our immigration. My friend
froth New York [Mr. B. H. Koberts] referred
to its increase yesterday. 1 allude to it for a
different purpose—to call the attention of the
committ.ee to the labor character of many of
the immigrants, i have here a table showing
the immigration for the quarter ending 31st
December, 1871. I find there were 395 black-
smiths, 102 brewers, 513 carpenters, 100 cigar-
inakers, 474joiners, 53 machinists, 326masons,
and 951 mechanics whose trades are not class-
ified. Then I find there were 1,032 miners,
24 molders, 68 shipwrights, who must have
supposed there was work for them here or
they would not have come ; 373 shoemakers,
indicating most clearly that there was work
for them or they never would have come in
quest of it; 423 tailors; and so on through
various other occupations.
Look, too, at the general condition of the
people. When were they ever so well fed,
well clothed, and well housed; in short, when
did they ever live so well ? When were they so
little in debt, and when did they feel so little
the burdens of public duty? I cannot better
close this protest against the disturbance of the
financial and industrial policy of the country,
so favorable and every way beneficent in its
effects, than by quoting from the admirable
little work of 8ir John Bernard iiyles on the
Sophisms of Free Trade. As an Englishman
his words will have more weight than mine
certainly, poasibly than any American econ-
omist:
"The most prosperous of all nations for the last
fifty years has been the United States. Yet the
exports and imports of the American Union, not-
withstanding its vast augmentation in population,
are not very much greater than they were forty years
ago. It is the unregistered home production and
home trade, doubling and quadrupling over and
over again, that has created this unexampled pros-
perity." (Appendix D.)
I thank my friend from Indiana [Mr. Kerr]
for his courtesy in extending my time, and 1
trust, it may be returned to him by the gentle-
man who will follow.

ury of expenditures for the next fiscal year

5,783,333 OQ
Total  $301,705,036 99
I propose to compare this with the expendi-
tures of 1869.
In a just and fair comparison with the ex-
penditures prior to the war it is necessary to
eliminate all items fairly chargeable to war
expenses; pensions, sinking fund, and interest
thereon ; permanent appropriations being, ex-
cept some six millions for interest on the pub-
lic debt, &c., the oostof the Internal lieveuue
Bureau, and the increased cost of the customs
service. The item for public works should be
deducted, including the improvement, of rivers
and harbors, public buildings, &e., of which
little or nothing was done in the period selected
for comparison. These deductions are:
Pensions 430,480,000 00
Sinking fund    22,895,930 00
Interest on sinking fund   5,783,333 00
Permanent appropriations, less the sum
of $6,000,000  120,281,974 00
Public works.—    19,408.562 97
Internal revonue expenses last year.... 9.00K68071
Customs*  12.000,000 00
. . S219.911.480 68
This sum deducted from $801,705,036 99
leaves $81,793,556 31 as the net oidinary
expenses aside from those accruing by reason
of the war.
This in currency, reduced to acoin basis at ten
per cent, gold premium, gives $73,014,200 08.
The expenditures of 1859, a fair average
year, less affected than 1860 by the premoni-
tory echoes of the approaching struggle, were:
Army «23,154,720 53
Navy  14.690,927 90
Indians  3,4110,534 53
Pensions        1,222,222 71
Miscellaneous 27.797,544 40
Interest  2,(137,649 70
Total $68,993,599 77
Deducting the payments for pensions and
interest three remains $05,136,727 30 as the
net ordinary expenses of ad ministration for the
year 1859. We had then a population of thirty-
one millions, in round numbers, o!' whom lour
millions were slaves, paying no taxes and
forming no part of the body-politic, leaving
twenty-seven millions to bear the burden of
the Government, at an average per capita
of $2 41. Our population next year will not
fall below forty millions, every one a citizen,
with all the obligations as well as the rights
of citizenship. Divided among them, the net
estimated expenditures will be $1.84 per
capita, say—
1859   82 41
1873 -   1 84
Decrease,     $0 57
or twenty-three andsixty-five hundredths per
cent. In confirmation, is the statement of the
actual expenditures for the last fiscal year. The
like deductions for war expenses give a similar
result.
* These last two items are estimated for last year's
expenditures. Our customs receipts have more than
quadrupled, and deduct three fourths of last year's
expenditures for this service.
