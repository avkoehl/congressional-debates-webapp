THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 12,
oer for our purpose. He would go as high as
fifty copies to be placed in the Libi ary. And surely
this was a liberal number. If the resolution was
thus modified, he would support it. He was not
in favor of purchasing them for the members to
be taken home and used for their individual pui-
poses. We had already engaged in a work for
which we were to pay four hundred and twenty
thousand dollars, at least, and which had it not
been for the commendable zeal and care of the
committee last year, would have cost the Govern-
ment at least three millions
Mr. HILL said he. had made some calculation of
the cost of books and maps and printing oidered
at a single session of Congress, leaving out seveial
items oí former purchases, which have been sup-
plied to present members
1 am told the printing alone ordered to be ex-
ecuted by the printer of the Senate at the last ses-
sion of Congress, amounts by computation to ihe
enormous sum of $120,000
This is more than ten times the amount of the
printing ordinarily directed by this body in other
times, when the Senate was not at war with the
Executive, and when the punter was fuendly to
the Administration and the voice of the people It
amounts to an average of $2,500 to each of the
forty-eight membeis of the Senate
Besides this, there were ordered a>id paid for,
according to the statement of the Clerk, printed
and laid upon our tables at the commencement of
the session, the following articles.

Galea & Seaton, for thirteen copies eight
volumes State Papéis, §11 25 each... 1,173 00
$7,092 25
This will add $145 75 for each member of the
Senate
And still further- $50,000 arnually foi Gales &,
Seaton's State Papers, and $50,000 expenditure on
Clarke and Force's Documentary History, would
aveiage to the two hundred and nmety-one Sen-
ators, Representatives, and Delegates, for the
year, $340 each, and would make in the whole,
§2,985 75 to each member of the Senate, as the
expense of books and punting for a single year
Of the items I have called over, one or two aie
deserving comment. One of the departments
had procured as a mattei of favoi to that part of
Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and at
a great expense, the survey, engiavmg, and fur-
nishing, a map of Narragansett bay, a sufficient
quantity to answer all ordinary purposes This
was not enough. Senators living in distant States,
who had as little to do with Na ragansett bay as
they had with Winnipieseogee lake and bay, or
any othei distant water, must be furnished with
additional copies of an unwieldy map, and $300
more are expended in printing and furnishing an
extra number of these for the forty-eight Sena-
tors
The thirteen copies or sets, eight volumes each,
of Gales & Seaton's State Papers, also call for
comment. 1 was surprised at the last session,
when I was informed that the whole seven hun-
dred and fifty copies of Gales & Seaton's State
Papers, furnished for Congress, had already been
disposed of, and that a purchase must be made
of additional numbers to supply new members
The eight volumes purchased cost only about the
sum of ninety dolíais for each set, and when the
twenty volumes come to be completed, if the pub-
lishers shall not see fit to raise the price,—which
will depend on circumstances,—the added expense
for each riew member, foi this one article, will
be $225.
Ihis work of Gales & Seaton, it shou'd be rec
ollected, oiigmated in this manner They at fiist
publibhed in their newspaper proposals foi punt-
ing a Compilation of Congressional Documents
After several ineffectual attempts, at last a res
olution passes, pet fas el nefas, both Houses of
Congress, authoiizu gaaubst_iiption of seven hun-
dred and fifty copies, embracing a peuod of time
down to 1815 This subscription of Congress
obtained, it is believed not a single additional sub
sciiber wa^ sought for oi procured
Afterwards an addition.] resolution 13 pissed,
extending the time, and limiting the extension to
eignt additional volumes The puce paid in each
instance is fixed to the price paid to the printers
of Congress foi the oidmary printing of the two
Houses,. Tms price is from twenty-five to fifty
pel cent, highei than the same woik would cost
111 Philadelphia, in New Yoik, in Boston, and in
several othei places And the money thiown
away in price overpaid on this work of Gales &
Seaton,and thatof Clarke and Force, will amount
to between two and three hundied thousand dol-
lars'
1 will state the items of thiee contracts on which
from two to thiee hundred thousand dollars are
absolutely thrown away, made by resolutions
which have, in someway—those mteiested can
tell how—been earned tlnougli Congress, when
peihaps one member in ten did not understand
either their tendency or extent. They aie aa foi
low.
Gales & Seaton's American State Papers, 20 vol-
nms, 750 copies, probable cost $10,000 each
volume.....................              $200,000
Claike and Force's Documental y Hist-
ory, 30 to 40 volumes, calculated to be
confined to the cost of..............400,000
Duff Green for printing Land Laws, in-
dependent of other punting ordeied
exclusively by the Senate, 16 volumes,    60,000
$660,000
Two, if not three, of the last named volumes, 1
I am informed, will be a reprint of the very vol-
umes to be executed by Gales &, Seaton '
The ait of working through Congress resolu- j
tions or acts, favoi able to those whom they are
intended to benefit, could not be better exemplified
than in those directing the publication of books by
the pet printers and publishers for both Houses
of Congiess Gales & Seaton, it is understood,
printed for Congress seven hundred and fifty
copies, and received of Congress ertire pay for
preparation and composition and distribution of
the types, using the same types and composition
to punt for themselves seven hundied and fifty
other copies The resolution requnes that the
members of the Twenty Firstand Twenty Second
Congress shall be supplied with the books, the
consequence is, befoie this woik is half way
thiough the press, the seven hundred and fifty
copies are all taken up, the$¡,200,000 ap< topriation
is all run through, and at each successive session
of Congrebs, to supply new membeis, the Secie
tary of the Senate or Clerk of the House is obliged
to go to the publishers and pay them just what
price they ask for additional numbers Thirteen
sets of these additional numbers were bought for
the Senate last sesson, and I am told from one
hundred and twenty five to one hundied and fifty
additional sets of the same work were required foi
the House of Representatives
The íesolutions requne that the members of the
Twenty First and Twenty Second Congress shall
be supplied, with just as much propuety might
the resolution provide that members of the First
Congress, or members of foity years ago, should
be supplied with Gales & Seaton's State Papers,
as that members of the Twenty-First Congress,
who were here four years ago, should be sup-
plied.   And I would not be at all surprised heie-
after, to find members of each ai,d every Congress
or the " heirs and legal representatives" of mem-
bers of Congress coming in here and claiming for
each, copies of these State Papers, or the value of
such State Papers, " with interest" for the whole
time of delay
It will be seen that the resolution despatches at
once the seven hundred and fifty copies, and the
new Congresses of two terms, more will nearly or
quite consume the additional seven hundred and
fifty copies, for which Gales & Seaton get pay, as
It printed at then own expense, while the greatebt
half of the expense of punting has been paid by
Congress
It was admitted on all hands at the last session
that Congress had been ti'ten in by the bargain
which had been made withCiarkeand Force for the
Documentary History, and it was thought to be a
momentous affair to pioeure the assent of those
gentlemen *o «uch terms as would limit the whole
expense of this printing to foui hundred thousand
dollars ' But the gist of the matter did not then
appear The act of Congress which authorizes
the contract with Clarke and Force directs the dis-
tubution of those volumes to the membeis of the
Twenty Fust and Twenty Second Congiess, in the
same manner as the State Papéis aie distiibu'ed,
and this too when not even the first volume of the
Documentary Histoiy has yet been printed So
that Clai ke and Force's first seven hundred and fifty
copies have all been disposed of to oldTnembeis
and otheis before the existence of theTwenty-
Ihird 01 present Congress, and if this Congress
or its successors obtain any, it must be by pur-
chase of the extra copies, and Clarke and Force,
long before their work shall be completed, will
have made sale, at their own price, of double that
number which the act of Congiess had provided
for The membeis of Congiess who were not
here when the act passed, who are no longer
members, and who have no stronger claim to
them than any and every man, woman, and child-*
" fiom snowy white to sooty," in the country,
are to be supplied with their twenty, thirty, or
forty volumes of Documentary History of the
Revolution The restuction to four hundred thou-
sand dollars foi the seven hundred and fifty copies
virtually amounts to nothing, if we do not put a
stop to furnishing members of Congress with all
the books that have been furnished their piede-
cessors If that practice continues,, there can be
no limit either as to numbers or amount of ex-
pense Ga'es&Seaton and Claike and Force may
just as well print two thousand, or three thousand,
as seven hundred and fifty copies, and both are
quite as safe in estimat ng the amount they will
finally take fiom the Treasury, in theone instance
at a half, and in the other at a whole million of
dollars, as at two hundred and four hundred
thousand dollars each
Mr. President, the gift and distribution of books
to members of Congress, even of «such books as
appertain to oui duties as legislators, are of little
advantage to the public interests I have heard of
members of Congress offering their books for sale
in this city, and disposing of them at one-tenth or
one-twentieth theircost. Í am told thereare books
now on sale at one or more places in the city fui-
nished by members of Congress for that purpose
If the friends of ihis mode of distribution doubt
the fact, they have it in their power to disprove
it by appointing a committee to investigate the
matter But, sir, in the main, the books are car-
ried to the homes of the respective membeis, and
never retuined here Having occasion recently to
look into the volumes of State Papers on the sub-
ject of foreign relations, and containing the several
treaties and negotiations with Fiance, it was more
than a week before I was able to procure the use
of the two volumes on those subjects If books
are procured at all for the use of members, they
ought to be retained in the Library, to be used bj
the successors, as well as by the piesent members
of Congress In such an event, a small number
would answer all our purposes; and we should
not have occasion to spend the millions which
have been, and are to be,lavished on pet printers,
whose best recommendation to the favor of Con-
gress seems to have been their violence as pai ti-
sans and editors of newspapers ooposed to the
great body of freemen of the United States, and to
