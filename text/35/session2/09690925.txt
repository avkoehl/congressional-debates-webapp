or it all falls on the consumer. If it ail falls on
the consumer, you have a burden of $200,000,000
on the whole country. Who gets the benefit?
The Government gets $60,000,000, and the man-
ufacturers get the rest. The manufacturing estab-
lishments are located in New England, New-
York, and Pennsylvania, mainly, and some in
New Jersey. Thus about one third of the Union
gets all the benefit, while the burden falls on the
; the s.even years following, up
to the pienerit time, it isnineand ninety six isun-
diedtiis— eay ten cents a pound; and if you take I!
the whole twelve years, from 1846 to the present |'
time, we find that it averages nine and eight tenths
cents a pound—just forty per cent, higher than it t
was under the tariff of 1842. i
You will come to the same resultif you take the !;
years of larire production in each period, or take :|
those of small pioduction and high prices, as I ''
havefound by taking the aveiage. In other words, j:
any gentleman will find that as the tariff was high, ;[
cotton was low; and the reverse. ■)

3832-33; futhiy, that of the tariff of 1842; and, ,j
sixthly, the period since, under that of 1846. If :|
you go through all these periods, vou will find 'i
the changes exactly as i state. Hut the case does -
not rest on this aione. ]Let us look, for a mo- !;
mem, at other products. I will not weary the
Senate by gnii>i> into details as to them; but I '!
say, and eneh Jjen.itoi can verify n for himself, 11
if you take all the exports, during the four yuis
of the tarur of 1B42, of eo'ton, rice, tobacco, :!
and everything, you will And that they brought :
$30,000,000 less than they v/onhl have done at
the prices of the meuous-four years: and if ihe

, and ihe retail uealeis put a larjre profit, generally
| more than fifty per cent., on the price when they
1 sell to the consumers; so that if you put all the
i profit of both these classes,you will find that the
j $60,000,000 paid to the Government costs actually
! more than $100,000,000 to the consumers. There
| can be no doubt about that. The consumers of the

each congressional district.
But the case does not stop here. The manu- i
facturers likewise receive a large profit. I should '
like to know how much they estimate it to be
worthy They toll us all around that if you repeal
the tariff their business will be ruined.'They tell
us that th'-y supply thiee 01 four times as many
foods as arc imported. In fact, many of the mer-
chants teli me that they behove two thirds of the
dutiable goods are made m this country. If that
be the cas^, and the price is enhanced to the same
extent with the duty, there must be, at the least,
two hundred million dollars more to fall on the
consumer. I do not think it amounts to that
much; I think it pi ohanle that many persons who
are near the lactone* pmchase rather cheaper on
that co fount. Hut suppose you take it at the sum
oi ^1J 1,000,000; that, added to the other now paid

the high tariff, but as the tnrill's were reduced
the exports laigeiy increased in quantity as well
as jn value. I rind that, duung the existence of
the tariff of 1842, the amount of breadstuff's which
wore sold for those four years averaged only
$18,000,000 a year; and for the twelve years since
they have aveiaged $46,000.000—two and half
times as much, it may be well enough to re-
maik m this connect,0:1, tlu>t, fur the last five
years, flour has been iifty-iour per cent, higher
than it was during the npuation of the tariff of
3b42; tobacco one hundred and fifty per cent,
higher. Puce,and c very-hing else, hasadvanced.
And if you te.Ke a;i the exports itnd^r the tar:if
of 1842, tijeir \v ht<le amount is just £110,000,000
a year upon the average, and the
$108,000,000. For the last five years
are $310,000,000, on the aveiage,and
§308,000,000. in other words, in twelve years,
"while the population of the country had increased 1
not quite forty per cent., we have had nearly a •
three-told increase in our exports and our Jinpo< ts. 1
We hove seen that we appear to have lost j
$30,000,000 a yea-, by the tanff of 1-8 t2,'on those i
exports of ^.110,000,000. If you npphed the sams i
rule to the oresent oiie^ we should be losmgnearly '
5)90,000,000 a year; that is, if the products sold ;
lor the last five years had been sold at the prices
much. Su, they would riot if ihey knew it*. Let
| us consider it in this way tor a moment. The im-
porters now pay these duties, and they charge
them to the consumers as a part of the price;
but suppose you revu-se it, and nut your tax col-
lectors at the litt'e retail stores; yon place a man,
i say, at every retail store in the country to col-
lect there the duties; he looks on and charges
the taxes according to the purchases; he says
to one man, you have bought a dollar's worth of
sugar, and you must pay me twenty-four cents
tax on thai; to a second, you have puichased five
doilais' worth of iron, you must pay me §1 20
on that; to a third, you have bought ten dollars'
worth of broadcloth, pay me $2 40; to a fourth,
that salt which you have bought is worth two dol
I have thought that some of our southern men
made a mistake in former arguments on this ques-
tion. They endeavored to make it appear that it
was a northern and southern question. The ten-
dency of that was to array the whole North as
a body, in favor of protection. It is my delib-
erate judgment, that the Northwestern States
suffer qurte as much as any part of the Union.
They are far 111 the interior, and these taxes are
accumulated by successive profits. I have no"
doubt they suffer more than 1 he Atlantic States,
but all the agriculture of the country is heavily
jj oppressed in this way. Remember, too, that ag-
lj riculture is the great business of the country,
'j _ Hut, sir, I have shown that our exports and
.j imports have largely increased under lowerduties;
|i i mu;ht refer also to their efT-ct on our tonnage,
jl I find thatthe tonnage m isoj was ],298,000 tons,
J! and in 184G, 2,562,000, not quite doubling in
i| twenty-six year?-*; and in 1858, it is .5,049,000 tons,
b nearly double what it was in 1846; that is, the in-
|; creased tonnage in twelve years, under the tariff
j; of 1846, is as great relatively; and much gieater
1' absolutely, than it was in the previous twenty-
;i six years.
|| _ But gentleman tell us thpt this system of trade
is ruining the country; that we are piling up an
enormous foieign debt; and the Senator from
Pennsylvania, the other day, said that we were
buying more than wc could pay for. Why, Mr.
President, if" you look to our exports for the last
fiv." yeais you will find that they exceed the im-
j porta. Ur pays, our people can only consume
, nine dollars' worth annually per head of foreign
articles. How does he arri\*e at that result ? Un-
! der some of the previous oppt easive tariffs men
j were not able to consume, and did not consume,
■ more than four or five dollars'worth; but'suppose
I you say to a farmer, now '• you are eating and
; drinking too much; you are living too high;" can
i he not, if true, reply to you, " i pay for\ill these
things with my crop, and havea surplus besides."
If the Senator from Pennsylvania will compare the
exports and imports he will find that the exports,
ne imports lars, I must have forty-eight cents tax on that: j according to the statements made, actually exceed
the exports if it were done in that way you would see an |j the imports; and hence, we may well Fay, that as

ISow, i adopt the theory that the producer pays a large
wa.-j a step wi the direction of free trade,
suppose we could rake the whole distance; sup-
pose we could actually come to fiee trade: there
is not a Senator hero who ha^ ever made i he com -
pansoii, wfio will not soy that the step from the
tarifl of 1846 to freetiade is a longer one than
that from the act of 1843 to that "of 1846; in
other words, if we gain $>90,000,000 a vear by
substituting the unties of 1846 for those'of 1842,
we Miould  ain more than $90,000,000 by coming
to fjee (rade. In point of fact, ! have no duuht
inar we los" ^100,000,000 a year, or more, as nro-
duceis,under the operations of the present tariff.

; leads you to the same result. Gentlemen say
! that the tariff does not raise pricey at all on the
consumer. That was the argument of the gen- .
tleman from Pennsylvania . [Mr. Bigler,] the
other day. If it does not; why do they want it5
If it does not raise prices on the consumer, is u .

New York, goes to Liverpool,
buys British goods, and returns. If those goods
were worth, in fact, no more than the cotton,
there would be a loss. There is the Gse of the
ship, the pay of the captain and the men, the in-
surance, and all the profits to come into the ac-
count. In pomt of fact, our imports must, in the
lon^ iun of years, exceed the exports; and that
they do not do so on the Treasury tables, I have
no doubt, arises from the fact that there is smug-
gling and undervaluation; but that seems to have
existed in about the same ratio under the tariff
of 1842 and that of 184C.
There is especially a complaint against the Brit-
ish trade, which, it is said, is ruining the coun-
try. Why, sir, we sold last year to Great Brit-
ain $187,000,000 of our products, and bought
$127,000,000—i m^an, the whole British domin-
ions took from us export*, to them, of $60,000j000
