we struck them, going, he says, to Shepherdstown; Fitz Lee's cavalry was also on the road, but had turned off toward Martinsburg; both Early and Breckinridge were at Leetown with the troops. The lieutenant further says he don't know where the two other divisions of Rodes and Ramseur are, nor where the two under Anderson are, but supposes the latter about Halltown or in that direction; their trains also moved to-day,but not by the road upon which Early was marching. An officer just in from Torbert says he thinks they are following Merritt with cavalry, but the firing seems too heavy and continuous for that; he also says Torbert had turned off the Shepherdstown [road] and is bearing directly for the river about Antietam Ford. The firing seems to grow nearer. I am sending out scouting parties. My impression is that the rebel lieutenant's statement is reliable, and that they are making a move northward. The absence of the trains is nothing significant, even if true. A strong attack on the two divisions still in your front, or thought to be, might stop them. I will forward all the prisoners at once-eight or ten.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION,August 25, 1864-5 p.m.

Lieutenant-Colonel FORSYTH, Chief of Staff:

The two divisions of cavalry formed a junction at Walper's Cross-Roads about 9 a.m., neither having seen anything of the enemy before arriving there. The command was closed up and the advance made in the following order: Chapman's brigade on extreme left, half a mile from pike; McIntosh close by the side of the pike; Custer on McIntosh's right, and Cesnola on extreme right; all by flank of brigades, with skirmishers in front; regular brigade in reserve on pike. About a mile beyond Kearneysville met the enemy. Chapman bore farther to the left, guided by Colonel Brinton; struck enemy in flank. McIntosh dismounted and moved forward heavy skirmish line; Custer same on his right. Cesnola charged, mounted, through open fields; drove the enemy three-quarters of a mile; soon ascertain that his force was all infantry; drove the skirmishers clear back, killing quite a number, and before they could attack with main force our cavalry was mounted and rapidly withdrawn, covered by a line of mounted skirmishers, and the Reserve Brigade ready to act. Officers and men behaved with great gallantry and steadiness. Loss of my division will not exceed seventy. The enemy did not pursue me after I withdrew from the pike, but seemed to continue toward Shepherdstown. General Torbert reports with cavalry. Torbert is now moving toward me.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brigadier-General.
