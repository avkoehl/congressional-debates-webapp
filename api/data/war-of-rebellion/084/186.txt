HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SAINT LOUIS,Saint Louis, July 14, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel J. T. BURRIS,

Cape Girardeau:

I want one of the best disciplined companies of the Second Regiment here. I think you had better reduce the force at Cape Girardeau rather than at New Madrid, but of that you will judge for yourself.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., July 14, 1864

Brigadier General O. GUITAR,

Rolla, Mo.:

The general commanding will probably relieve the Third Missouri State Militia at Saint James, and send them to another station. In this case you will have to make arrangements to replace them.

WARRENSBURG, MO., July 14, 1864

Gregg passed north near Tipton yesterday morning, robbing the state and express from Boonville. The stage was robbed of horses and mail between Independence and Kansas City this morning. Troops are in pursuit of both parties.

WARRENSBURG, July 14, 1864-2.40 p.m.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis:

I respectfully ask an answer to my communications of the 26th of June* and 7th of July, asking that two companies of One hundred and thirty-fifth Illinois be moved from the Osage to Jefferson City, and relive the mounted troops at that station, as I want them in the field.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General, of Volunteers.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., July 14, 1864.

General BROWN,

Warrensburg, Mo.:

I had just seen for the first time your dispatch of the 11th, suggesting that the Seventh move by Lexington, to join Ford. Very sorry I did not see it when first received. If it is not now too late the commanding general desires you will cause any remaining force of the Seventh which you may send to Ford to proceed via Lexington.

O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
