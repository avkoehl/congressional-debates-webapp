ACQUISITION OF TFRRITORY
The following resolut on, submitted yesterday
by Mr  Sevier, was taken up
Resohed, That the Piesident of the United
States be requested (if not deemed incompatible
with the public inteiest) to negotiate with Spam
for her light and title to the countiy lying between
the Sabine and Red nveis, in x\rkansas Terri-
tory
Mr SEVIER said Mr Speaker, it is my duty
pel haps to explain to the House the object I have
in view in offering that resolution Tneic is,
sir, a consideiable tiactof valuable countiylying
noith of the Sab'ne end south of Red nvei,upon
which many of oui citizens have íes ded for
ycais acountiy of which we have had the un-
distuibed possession, and over which we still
exercise jmisdiction, that will, in all piobability,
he lost to us foiever, if the boundaiy line, desig-
nated by the treaty of 1819 between this Govern-
ment and Spam, should be poimanently estab-
lished I believe Spam to be the nghtful owner
of this tract of countiy, and of that Government,
I presume, we can obtain it for a mere tiifle It
is true Mexico claims this country, but I ask,
what evidence ha  she of her t tie' Has she pui-
chased it' Has she coiqueied it' No she ha3
done neither, and as well night her ciiDidity ard
auogance lead hei to set up a clum foi Cuba, as
foi the tractof country in question Mexico nescr
íevolutionizcd the countiy noith ot the Sabine—
she nevei marched a soldier into it—noi has she
evei given a dol'ai for it Oui Citizens have held
the undisturbed possession of this countiy fiom
1806 down to the piesent day It is true, we
ceded it to Spain m 1819, foi which she gave us
the Floiidas Has Spain evei paited with hei
light acquned by that treatj ' Has she ever sold
it' lias it b en Ui.cn fiom her' No, sn, she
has not sold it, noi L is Mexico ever taken ltnom
hei, or been in possession of it Upon what
technical, v un, and ¡limsy piel ex t is it, then, upon
which she foul is her claim to a counuy w uch
she never aoquied by aims, or t casuic, or n
lieritancc' Will any 1 onorable gentleman be kind
enough to nifnim me ' I11 it by discovnj, backed
by a bull fiom a Pope' A title thus acquired may
have been good in the days of Coi tez and Pizario
—it may yet be good wbeie Indians alone are
concerned, but I appichenJ we aie not prepaud
to recognize it as vilid at tins daj in iegaid to
ouiselvcs We, sir, have bi.cn foi yeais negoti-
ating- with Mexico upon a subject about vvhu h
we ought never to have negotiated, and if I am
eonectly i ifoi ned, we ire sull negotiating with
hei upon this «ame subject, when public policy
and nition-l dignity and justice should induce us
to abandor it
