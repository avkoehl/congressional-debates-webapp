NOVEMBER 30, 1863.-Skirmish at Yankeetown, Tennessee

Report of Lieutenant James P. Brownlow, First Tennessee Cavalry.*
HEADQUARTERS FIRST TENNESSEE CAVALRY, Sparta, Tennessee, December 1, 1863.

COLONEL: Colonel Hughs' command, consisting of Murray's, Hampton's, [Hamilton's?] Bledsoe's, Ferguson's, Daugherty's, and other bands, attacked Lieutenant Bowman while scouting, on yesterday, and after skirmishing for some time, drove him across the river within 2 miles of this place, killing 4, wounding 1, and capturing 5. I went immediately to his assistance, and drove the enemy (numbering 500) 8 miles, killing 9, and wounding between 15 and 20.

I would take no prisoners. One of the Ninth Pennsylvania was mortally wounded (died this morning), and Captain McCahan wounded in the ankle.

Eighteen scouts, of the Second Michigan, got leave last evening. Send Doctor Green to this place. On account of the heavy picket duty, I would like to have one more company, unless the brigade is coming soon.

Very respectfully,JAS. P. BROWNLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Colonel A. P. CAMPBELL,

Commanding First Brigade.
