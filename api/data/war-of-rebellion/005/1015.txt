HEADQUARTERS, Centreville, January 1, 1862.

Honorable J. P. BENJAMIN, Secretary of War:

SIR: I had the honor to receive this morning your letter of the 27th ultimo, conveying the President's orders in relation to Brigadier-General Whiting.

I beg to be allowed to intercede in this case, partly because this officer's service as brigadier-general are very important to this army, and partly because I also share the wrong. I am confident that he has in his heart neither insubordination nor disrespect. Had I returned the letter to him, pointing out the objectionable language in it, it would, I doubt not, have been promptly corrected. I regret very much that in my carelessness it was not done. No one is less disposed than I to be instrumental in putting before the President a paper offensive in its character.

Brigadier-General Whiting has a very important command-that of the troops near Evansport and on the Lower Occoquan; is a soldier of high ability; has studied his situation and circumstances; his removal now might be unfortunate should the enemy attack before his successor had equally qualified himself for that command. The only officers who can be intrusted with it are in command of division from which they cannot be taken. I therefore beg the President to pass over this matter.

Should the President adhere, to his decision, I respectfully ask that his orders may be so far modified as to place this "able engineer" on duty in this department, instead of in one of its districts. Major
