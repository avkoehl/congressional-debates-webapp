Richmond, Va., October 6, 1864.

General R. E. LEE,

Chaffin's Bluff:

Following massage from telegraph operator at Gordonsville has just been sent me by the president of the company. I send it for your information:

Scout came in here about fifteen minutes ago, and reported to Major Richards that the enemy crossed the Rapidan this morning at 9 o'clock. He says he was in full view of them, and was sure it was a brigade of their cavalry. Just now another came in and reported them this side of Orange Courte-House. I do not place much reliance on it, although I am prepared to leave at a moment's notice. The major has sent a special courier down to see about the truth of it. I will advise you when he returns.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
