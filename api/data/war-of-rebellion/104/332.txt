Colonel R. H. G. MINTY,Commanding Second Division, Cavalry Corps:

COLONEL: The Stars and Stripes are floating over the capitol of Alabama. General McCook entered the city this morning without firing a shot. Encamp your division on this side of Catoma Creek. There is no good camp close to the city on the Hayneville road. Find the best camp you can. General Wilson does not want to have any enlisted men in the city. Whatever rations and forage there may be in the city can be obtained by the division commissary and quartermaster by applying to the acting chief commissary and quartermaster of the corps. Please send word when the train gets up.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. B. BEAUMONT,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
