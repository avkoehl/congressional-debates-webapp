HEADQUARTERS IN THE FIELD,Near Strasburg, June 1, 1862-6 p.m.

Your telegram of this date received at 5 o'clock. The skirmish of this morning was confined to infantry and artillery of our advance and lasted about two hours, at the expiration of which time the enemy retired. Our loss only 7 wounded. State of rebels not known. I am now (6 o'clock) about driving in their pickets, and if that does not bring on a general engagement shall close with him early to-morrow morning.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY IN FIELD,Strasburg, June 1, via Moorefield, June 2, 1862.

A reconnoitering force just in reports the enemy retreating, but in what direction is not yet known. Our cavalry will occupy Strasburg by midnight. Terrible storm of thunder and hail now passing over. Hailstones as large as hens' eggs.

Major-General.

To the PRESIDENT.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY IN THE FIELD,Strasburg, 2nd.

The engagement of yesterday was renewed and continued until 10 o'clock at night, at which time my advance had driven the rear guard of the rebels into their main camp at a place called Round Hill, some 4 miles from Starsburg. At this point my cavalry attacked and dispersed a body of rebel cavalry, but pursued no farther on account of the storm. The enemy lost many in killed and wounded. We took 11 prisoners. Several wounded on our side, but none killed. My whole force is now (9 o'clock) up and in rapid pursuit of the enemy. I meet here General Bayard, with a regiment of cavalry, one company of infantry, and four guns, forming the advance of General McDowell. The officers who particularly distinguished themselves in the cavalry charge last night are Colonel Figyelmesy, of my staff, Major Finch, temporarily of the Sixth Ohio Cavalry, and Captain Fish, of the Connecticut cavalry.

J. C. FREMONT,

Major-General, Commanding.

Honorable E. M. STANTON.
