Revery Johnston, the commissioner of the United States, who was to settle the matter, to which we acceded.

Last week we were interrogated by the Honorable Revery Johnson, who made a record of our answer. We communicated to him and gave him copies of the letters addressed to our different bankers and to our house in relation to this transaction, and also as to its entry in our books; we added thereto a statement of facts, of which you will find inclosed a true copy. We went this morning to see Mr. Revery Johnson and to ask him for his decision, He replied to us that he had no authority to release this coin here, but that immediately on his arrival at Washington he would make his report-a report which, according to his own words, he left us to infer would be favorable according to his own words, he left us to infer would be a favorable. We asked him at the same time why General Butler had prevented us from withdrawing this coin from the consulate. He replied to us that he did not know.

Such are the facts, Mr. Consul, which we take the liberty to relate to you, asking the favor of you to have the goodness to submit them to the ambassador of France at Washington.

We protest in the most solemn manner against any insinuation or suspicion whatever which should tend to have the Government of the United States to suppose that this coin is destined to any other object than the one of covering the drafts which we have drawn to meet it. We repeat that we have only intended to make a purely commercial transaction, and cannot for the reasons which have caused its seizure.

We beg you to insist with the ambassador that this coin be returned to us immediately, for not only does any delay in its transmission seriously injure our interests, but further exposes us to the dangers inherent to the state of war and the complication which may arise therefrom.

We have the honor to be, count, your very obedient servant,

E. DUPASSEUR &amp; CO.
