quartermasters, and Captain McClenahan, acting commissary of subsistence, many thanks should be rendered. The duties of the quartermaster's department were excessively laborious on account of the limited means of transportation, and it is a matter of congratulation that with such means they were so well preformed.

The reports of engineers officers will inform the commanding general of the condition of the various works, as well as the acts of officers in that branch of the service.

I have the honor to transmit herewith a sketch of the position of the enemy's fleet at 4.15 p. m. on the 7th; a return of the guns engaged; a return of ammunition expended; a numerical return of causalities, and the reports of different commanders. to the last I beg respectfully to refer for such information as is not included in this report.*

I have also to transmit there with two Abolition ensigns obtained from the Keokuk, as she lies off Morris Island Beach, by Lieutenant Glassell, C. S. Navy, one of which is evidently the ensign under which she fought and was worsted.

None of the iron-clads flew large flags, the object having doubtless been to avoid presenting a mark to our artillery.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. S. RIPLEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding

Brigadier General THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
