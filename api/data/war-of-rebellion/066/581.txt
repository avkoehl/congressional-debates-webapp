Colonel J. GORGAS,Chief of Ordnance, Richmond:

I beg leave to call your attention to a requisition made by Colonel Gonzales, chief of artillery for this department, and duly approved, which was forwarded to your office on the -- day of May. The active operations of the enemy, which have already resulted in the disabling of some guns, and require that others shall be placed in position for the defense of exposed points, as also to strengthen batteries already established, renders it of the greatest importance to have these guns immediately furnished. May I ask your particular attention to this subject, with the request that you will promptly inform me of your action in the premises.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
