local defense of the place against raids, &amp;c.; all officers and employes of any railroad company in this State who are regularly and constantly employed in the service of such road at the date of this call; all telegraph operators and employes of the express company; all persons employed in any cotton or woolen factory or paper mills in this State who have details from the State who have details from the State and Confederate Governments, on condition that they keep themselves orgainzed as military companies, prepared to do all in their power to defend the factory in case of attack; the mayor of each of the cities above named and such policemen and firemen as he will certify to be indispensably necessary to the protection of the city; all practicing physicians, not exceeding three in a county, to be selected by the inferior court in case there are more, and all such millers as the court will certify are actually necessary at home; two agents of the relief fund, selected by the court for each county; all postmasters in cities, with their necessary clerks, and one postmaster in each county town and all mail-carriers constantly engaged in that business; all state-house officers and their necessary clerks; the officers and guards of the penitentiary, and the officers and employes of the State armory and card factory, who are required to drill twice a week as a military company for the defense of the capital; all persons who remain in counties in the rear of the enemy's lines; all who reside north of the Blue Ridge, with the people of the counties of Rabun, Habersham, White, Lumpkin, Gilmer, Pickens, and Dawson, on account of the great scarcity of provisions and the distance they have to haul them to preserve the lives of the inhabitants of those counties.

As the law of this State declares any man subject to military duty who refuses to respond to this order to be a deserter and liable to be tried and punished as such, all aides-de-camp at home and all justices of the inferior cours, sheriffs, clerks, ordinaries, and tax collectors and receivers of tax returns of the State who are by statute declared exempt from militia duty, are hereby required to travel through their respective counties constantly, and, if necessary, arrest and send forward all persons subject who refuse or neglect to report. In case any of these officers englect this duty, and refuse themselves to aid and report in repelling the enemy, it is hoped all who are in the service will remember them in future and place more faithful public servants in positions of responsibility. However weighty the reasons each man might be able to give for remaining at home, there are more important reasons why he should hasten to the front if he is able to travel. Georgians, you must re-enforce General Johnston's army and aid in driving back the enemy, or he will drive you back to the Atlantic, burn your cities and public buildings, destroy your property, and devastate the fair fields of your noble State.

If the Confederate Government will not send the large cavalry force now engaged in raiding and repelling raids to destroy the long line of railroad over which General Sherman brings his supplies from Nashville, and thus compel him to retreat with the loss of the most of his army, the people of Georgia, who have already been drawn upon more heavily in proportion to population than any other State in the Confederacy, must at all hazards and at any sacrifice rush to the front and aid the great commander at the head of our glorious self-sacrificing army to drive him form the soil of the Empire State.

I beg of you, fellow-citizens, to reflect upon the magnitude of the issue. If General Johnston's army is destroyed the Gulf States are thrown open to the enemy and we are ruined. Sherman's army cut off, the West is thrown open to us to the Ohio River, and all the raids within
