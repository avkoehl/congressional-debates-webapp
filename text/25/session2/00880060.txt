CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
sacred compact which I hold m my hand—the Con-
stitntwni
Mr S iaid the greatest objection he had to the
resolutions, was the danger of producing mischief
by the discussion—mischief by the excitement
that must necessarily be created m dipping into
these disquieting topics The proper course for
the South, was, as he had before observed, was to
remain still, and pay no attention to the move-
ments of these idle fanatics When these Aboli-
tion movements came from a higher source, he
would point to the Constitution, and that under that
instrument our possessions are guarantied Ver-
mont he thought had degraded herself by the adap-
tion of the resolutions, (which on a former occa-
sion, had been read m the Senate,) and by the
presentation of them to thi  body, had forfeited her
c'aims to respect He was willing to believe that
a majority of her citizens were opposed to their
adoption, and that by some fatmtous cncum-
stances, her Legislature had become momentarily
filled with abolitionists' He hoped for her ever-
lasting credit, that the result of her earliest delibe-
rations, would be to retrace her steps, and retract
the odious document directed to be presented Mr
S concluded, by observing that he was decidedly
in favor of voting against the recep'ior of all peti-
tions, memorials, or resolutions, (come from what-
ever quarter they might,) m relation to the subject
of slavery
Mr SWIFT said he had observed, as well dur-
ing the present as at previous discussions, that un-
pleasant allusions had been made to the resolutions
which he had offered, and improper reflections
passed upon the Sta e of Vermont He trusted
gentlemen would forbear any further allusions,
either to the documents or the State trom which
they emanated, during the present discussion, and
which was manifestly on a different subject He
thought it would be time enough when the memo-
rial fram his State should be brought beftie ihe
Senate, which, in accordance with a notice he had
previously given, he snoulu do at an ear y date
Mr CALHOUN said the Senator fiom North
Carolina, (Mr S range,) was averse to the d ses-
sion of tins subject, so was every one else, but he
ought to peach that to the abo'i íontsts, not to the
defenders of the sovereignty of the States W s
it not better to meet the quesuon a little o lei s \ ety
than not to meet it at all1 With regaid to the di c-
trmes of tne Constitution all might 1« tiM ,.<•-
quamted with them, and jei how v ere the' o"
served? Was the South to sit still -Mclseeti 
Constitution trodden undei foot, ai d its prmc pies
assailed? Would it not be bet'er to fy and la ly
around that body all who were orthodox tn their
political adherence' Look to the alien and sedi-
tion law Wa> that odious measure defeated
by sitting still, and quoting the authority ot the
Constitution? Was it not rather by a series of
brief, summary, and abstract reso'utiots? Bv
that straightforward manly cours  we would
protect our own rights, and a the same tune show
that ic was our, aim to defend to the I st the eh irter
handed dow n to us by om foiefattiers He v, ished
these resolutions bv no means ti be comid-nid as
strictly a southern measuie He hop°d th t ti e
vote that would be gi\en upon them, woi'd be a
noithern and we tern, as well as southern vote,
ana he appealed 11 th  honorable Senatoi whetuer
a strong vote would not ten 1 to restore, through" it
the Union, that confidence so mucn to be de-iivd
and whether it w onl 1 not also ha\ e   ten l ncy to
av ert this fatal tide of fanati ism'

himself to give ti   resolu 10 is his ooidipl supp it,

which it might be dangerous to '•"•"son Whj
address a packed jury, or reason \ ith a madman'
Of all species ot madness, theie was none more
dangerous than 'he madness of fanaticism   To r !
son, then, with those creatures, was to cast pearls
before swine The arguments, used by a!1 parties
would go forth, and act differently on duTennt
minds; and we all know the anx-ety that is main
fested by a certain set to hear what is going on in
relation to this matter Agitating this question in
any shape was ruinous to the South It wis like
tha* game played on the unforluna'e wight "heads
I win, tails jou 'ose " If we succ ed, by our dis-
cussions, m convincing our Northern brethren, what
becomes of our homes after the poison has reached
that quarter He repeated that it would have an
incalculably mischievous efftct, that w e had every
thing to lose, and nothing to gam
The question was then taken on the postpone-
ment to Wednesday ne\t, and carried
