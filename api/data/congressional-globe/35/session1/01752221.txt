| These "estimates are such as would be asked for, judging by other* for like placcs and purpo&es.
Office of Construction, Treasury Department, March 2, 1853.
Mr. DAVIDSON. I move to amend the amend- j
ment by adding a provision of $500,000 for the :
Treasury extension. I
Mr. Chairman, I was a good deal astonished |
to hear the remarks of the gentleman from Vir- !
ginia, [Mr. Letcher,] who is usually very clear ,
in his statements; and 1 send to the Clerk's desk,
and ask to have read, a letter from Mr. Bowman,
who sends up the information upon which the es-
timates are based.
The Clerk iead the letter, as follows:
Treastry Department, May 6,1S5S.
Sir : In my annual leport to you on the condition of the
sevetal building* being erected under the Treasury Depart-
ment, I had the honor to call attention to the appropriations
required to be made, to carry on the woiks with economy—
having a pioper re^rd to the pecuntaiy embarrassment of
the Treasury.
Since that period (September 30) the woiks liave pio-
grea-ed with mcieased vigor, owing to the abundance and
compilative cheapness oi luatouals and labor, consequent
upon the hard times. The icsult ha- been, that larger e\-
penditnies have been made than could then he anticipated.
A« mo^t of the woik-* are being done by contract, it was
impossible to restrain the indented expendituies.
Fiom this cause the unexpended balances that were ex-
pected to be available for the first two quarters of the next
fiscal year are greatly reduced, and. in <ome instances, en- !
tirely expended. Owing to t!n-> increased vigot m prosecut-
ing the woiki, many oi them will be fmi-hed. if toe neces-
saiy appropuations are now made, before the next meeting
of Congress.
Jn view of thf^e circumstance*, and to avoid damages
which the contractors will not f.ul m demand if the works
are Mispended, and at the same nine to >ave the Urge
amounts now annually paid tor rent of building*, which
thOM; in question are deigned to rcplaco, 1 would mo-t ic-
specifnl'y recommend that Congress be requested to make
the following appropriation*. Ail declined to complete, in
every particular all the buildings named, cxcept the cus-
tom "house-' at Ni'\v Oilcan* and Charleston, and the Tteu>-
ury extension, of which latter the <-um asked will finish the
south, and a poition of the won wing.
I also subjoin other emulates in gioss. accompanied by
others in detail, of the amounts nece^ary to fence, grade,
and furnish the-e binldin^that ate now completed, oi that
will be finished befoie the next meeting of Congre-^.
f have the honor to be. wiy respectfiillv. vour obedient
servant, A. II. BOV\MAN\
Engineer in charge of Treasury JDtpai tineai.
Hon. Howell Cobb, Secretary of the Treasury.
Mr. DAVIDSON. Now, Mr. Chairman, if
the o-entleman from Vicuna refers to the leport,
he will find that the labor at New Orleans is done
by the Government; but that, sir, is ail that is
A. II. BOWMAN, Engineer in Charge.
done. The Government does not supply the ma-
terials. They contract for them; and that is one
■ of the points which the gentleman seems to for-.
' get. He tells vou that a custom-house lias been
built at New York for $1,000,000, and that up-
wards of two million dollars has been already ex-
pended at New Orleans. He tells you that the
city of New York is the largest importing c;ty in
the United States; and that is true, and I am very
proud of it; but he forgets to tell you at the same
time that New Orleans is the largest exporting
city in the United States; and that the people of
; New York have never complained that the cus-
i tom-house is not sufficient, but are perfectly sat-
' isfied with it; whereas it became absolutely ne-
, cessary to build a large custom-house at New
: Orleans. If too much money has been expended
unon it, who is to blame? Is *^e fault of the
port of New? Orleans, or is it the fault of the man-*
ner in which the building lias been contracted for
, and carried on? What have this vigilant commit-
j tee been about, that they have permitted money
, to be expended in this manner, that ought not to
I hare been expended? The difference in the price
