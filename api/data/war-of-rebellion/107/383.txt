Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: Governor Dennison has sent to me copies of his telegraphic communication of yesterday to the lieutenant-general commanding, with the general's reply. A movement into Western Virginia may become necessary any day; so also it may any moment become imperative to move into Kentucky in order to save the loyal men of that State. With my present force it would be very dangerous to make these movements, particularly in view of the condition of the troops and the administrative branches. If we are to carry on this war in earnest, and in a manner to insure success, there should be at least 40,000 troops available for active operations in this department, and the means of transportation should be provided, as well clothing and equipment. Not less than twenty, and, if possible, thirty regiments, should be called for from this State. I was extremely sorry a few moments since to receive a dispatch from the Adjutant-General, stating that no recruits can be allowed for companies from Randall. There are 400 or 500 recruits at Newport Barracks, and plenty can be had by opening rendezvous on this side of the river.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, U. S. Army.

CINCINNATI, May 21, 1861.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND:

If I have to move into Western Virginia or Kentucky as may any day become necessary, the Ohio contigent is not sufficient. I have no accounterments, no means of transportation, and no money. The Adjutant-General refuses recruits from Newport Barracks for the companies from Randall. Without means I can do nothing. If the Union men of Western Virginia and Kentucky are to be assisted, I must have from twenty to thirty regiments of Ohio troops, batteries, and money.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.
