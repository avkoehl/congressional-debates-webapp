arms, did, I hear, get out of the way when the assault was made, but whether the report originated from that circumstance or from a fault too prevalent in this army to disparage the reputation of other commands which have been more successful in the campaign, I know not.

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 5, 1864-1.50 p. m. (Received 2 p. m.)

Major-General HANCOCK:

The major-general commanding directs me to state in reply to your dispatch that the order* about being issued requires you to extend your picket or skirmish line, with strong support, to the nearest point to the Chickahominy, relieving the cavalry pickets in that space. The cavalry will then picket the Chickahominy.

SECOND CORPS,

June 5, 1864-4.10 p. m.

General WILLIAMS:

GENERAL: I have sent over a prisoner of Thomas' brigade, Wilcox's division, A. P. Hill's corps. He says the troops now fighting in our front are Breckinridge's, supported by one division of Hill's corps, and that the other two divisions of Hill's corps are still farther to our right, and have not been engaged. He was captured by our pickets while he was out on a scout.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,June 5, 1864-5 p. m.

General [HUMPHREYS]:

I understand that General Wright's line is very short, and that he has many troops in reserve,and that General Burnside has a division in reserve, and that General Smith has reserves. Considering that Hill and Breckinridge are both in front of me, I would respectfully suggest whether General Wright could not relieve a portion of General Gibbon's line. General Gibbon has but one line, and I have had to keep a small brigade of General Birney in support of him which General Birney will require. General Barlow will have a second line. The major-general commanding will be able to decide.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
