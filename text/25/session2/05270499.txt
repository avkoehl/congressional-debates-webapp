Washington, July 9, IS38
Sir In the publication in the Globe of Saturdav evening last,
of the proceedings in the House of Representatives of the
preceding Tuesday, on the bill to modify a portion ofthe de
posite act of 1836, two errors ha\e occuued, to which I beg
leave to call your attention
In publishing the motion of Mr Rives, to commit the bill,
with instructions, you have left out the words, "or instru-
mentality," which should have been included The motion
made by him, and on which the vote was taken, wasasfol
lows To commit the bill to the Committee of Ways and
Means, "with instructions so to amend the same aa to dis
pense with the agency, or instrumentality, of banks in the
fiscal operations of the Government " Afu-r the motion was
made by Mr R I requested him to modify it, by striking
out the words, "or instrumeiUalUy," saying at the same
time, that such modification would make it acceptable to me,
but he declined to do so
The other error is much more important In reporting
the motion made by me, to commit the bill w Ji instructions
you have omitted the woids, 'so as to dispense with the use
of banks as depositories thereof51
The motion made by me was m the following words
'That the &aul bill be commitird to the Committee of Ways
and Means, with instructions to report a bill for the collec
tion, safe keeping, and disbursement, oí the public revenue,
so as to dispense with the use of banks as depositories
thereof"
May I ask of you to make the proposed corrections m 'he
next number of your paper1*

Youi obedient servant,
