PAOLA, June 14, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS,

Fort Leavenworth:

I had a force concentrated at Aubrey at daylight this morning, and shall have it increased to about twelve companies by to-morrow, although from last accounts I think there is no certainly as to the number or position of the enemy. Colonel Ford is in the field between Kansas City and Pleasant Hill. Will I be authorized to furnish the militia with forage when called into active service?
