SESSIONS or CONGRESS.
Mr HENDRICKS said it would be recol-
lected that, at the last session of Congiess, the
Committee on the Judiciary had been instiucted,
on his motion, to inquire mtO'the expediency of
fixing, by law, the time of tht commencement
and close of each succeeding session of Congress,
that this subject, owing to the gieit mass of busi-
ness befoie the session, w'neli was a shoit one,
did not receive the action of the co nmittee or of
the S nate, and it was Ins intuition, at the pres-
ent time, and at this eaily period of th s ssion,
again to present it to t'ii coiisidtiauon of the
S nato. Píe earnestly hopi d that the picsent
session would not pass away \ ltliout 1 git-lation
upon it. He was inducid t j look into this mat-
ter, from the fact of the g eat dispanty in the
length of the sessions, which disparity, too, was
continually increasing, by the continual increase
of the long sessions The idea of equalizing the
sessions, whatever then necessaiy length might
be, seemed to be a r> asonablt oin , and the in-
creasing length of the long sessions liad become
agiicvance and an evil vv uch ought to be reme-
died. The 3d of Match, fium long usage and
custom of this Go\trnm nt, had gtueially beer
lo iked upon as tht toiiiiuiation of eveiy Con
grtss, but it was not nccessanly so, not being
established as such, either by tht Consti ution or
by law. Ht stated it as a f ict, that, since the
first organization undi r tin Constitution of the
United States, Corgitss had passed no law on
the subject. Tlicie vves nothing in the statute-
book about it, and tin Senate of the United States
liad ne\cr acted upon it Theie was nothing in
ex stence upon this subject but a itsolution of
the old Congiess of the 13th Septembei, 17&8,
which was obviously intended asanmcipicmand
temporal y regulation, and so they had rested
ever since.
A glance at the history of this matter (said Mr
H ) will be sufficient to show us the propriety of
legislating upon it The convention whieh formed
the Constitution of the United Sates repotted
that instiument to the Congress of the Conredei-
ation on the 17th of Septembei, 17S7, and on the
28th of the same month, Congress resolved that
the Constitution so reooited bt transmit ed to
the States foi their ratificition. On the ljth of
September, 1783, Congress declared that tht Con-
stitution thus tiansmitted had been latifitd by
a sufficn nt number of the States to give u effect.
It was then necessary that meastues be taken
for the organization of the Fedeial Govtiament
under it, and on the same 13th day of SepteiaLer,
1783, the Congress of tht Confederation nsol.ed
that the first Wednesday of January ne\t t nsuing
be the day for appointing electors m the s \ trai
States v/iuch befoie that day should have íaüfied
the Constitution, that the £rst Wednesday of the
ensuing Ftbruaiy should be the day appo.nttd
for the electors to assemble in their rtspec'ive
States and vote for a President, and that the fust
Wednesday in March next be the time, and the
then present seat of Government tht plate, for
commencing the proceedings undei the Cocsutu
