1634.                                 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                                   155
Mr C assured the Chair he was only going to
allay the storm, and remarked, that although he
presumed that tie himself ough  to know wheie
he should stop, but as the Chair was of a different
opinion, he would yield to that opinion, and then
conclude.
Mr. BINNEY said he understood the rule of
order as the honorable Speaker had already more
than once stated it     The opinion of the Attorney
General had not been submitted to the bank or to
this House, and it was proper that, before it was
discussed, it should be examined by the Judiciary
Committee     As to the old soldiers, he had the
utmost possible kindness for them, and his per-
sonal regard for the bank would not, in any way,
conflict with his feelings towards them    But the
bank had not refused to pay the pensions to the
old soldieis, but would continue to pay them as
heretofore, in the manner authorized by law   He
went into a view of the duties of the Committee of
Ways and Means, to show that they related en-
tirely to the means of raising revenue, and the
sumí necessary for public uses     But it was said
that the memorials relative to the bank had all gone
to the Committee of Ways and Means, and, there-
fore, that was the proper committee for the con-
sideration of this subject.   To this he had two
answers, first, that the memorials were improp-
erly referred to that committee, but as it had been
decided that it was proper, he would, waive that
objection.    The other answer was, that the ques
tion of restitution was connected with the subjects
belonging to the Committee of Ways and Mean1!
The bank had asserted no right over this public
money, but they say that, though this was an
onerous duty imposed upon them, yet they had
undertaken it, and were, therefore, bound to dis-
charge it in the manner authonzed by the commit-
tee of Congress     It was, therefore, a question of j
the interpietation of a judicial statute   It referred,
n no possible form, to the subject of levenue   But I
he was averse to its going to the Coirmittee of
Ways and Means, even if it had any relation to
the questions properly belonging to that commit- |
tee     Man was man, and the excitemert aheady
produced among the members of that committee
would necessarily be extended to this subject, and
influence their decision upon it    Another reason
was, that it v/as due to the old soldiers to have a
separate discussion and decision of this question
If it was referred to tne Committee of Ways and
Means it would become mixed up with the whole
question of the deposites, and its decision would
be postponed until a final decision of that ques- I
tion should be had, which would not be until the i
close of the session     Tne bank, upon a decision I
of the House that she shall be relieved from the i
duty of disbursing this money, will be very willing
to gn e up the money    What does sne want with
this half a million of dollars' He hoped the ques-
tion would be decided very speedily, and he was
sure that an early decision would not be obtained
if the subject was referred to the Committee of
Wavs and Means                                                        ]
Mr BELL, of Tennessee, said, if it was the
object to have the legal question mqui-ed into and
reported upon, then, accoiding to parhamentaiy
practice and the rules of the House, the subject
ought to be referred to the Judiciary Committee
not, however, because that committee was more
competent to the duty, but because it related to
duties assigned to them If he was compelled to
say which committee embraced the best legal abil-
ity, he would say that it was the Committee of
Ways and Means, but that was not the question
If,a"ain,theobjectof the inquiry was to find where
the blame of the transaction lies, or to institute a
legal proceeding against tne bank, the Judicial y
Committee was the proper one If we are to go to
a legislative act, and expiess a declaratory law of
the meaning of the act of 1332, the subject belongs
to the Judicial y Committee But if the House
thinks that a regaid for the pu'o'ic interests require
that the agents should be changed—that by a
new law new agents should be constituted for
the disbursement of pensions, then the subject
belongs properly to the Committee of Ways and
Means                                                               ,        .
Mr FOSTER said that though a member of
the Judiciary Committee, he was averse to en
gaging in this contest between commit ees But
the importance of the question involved here in-
duced him to express his opinion. We could
make no question, it seemed, which was not in-
volved with the deposite question. We placed the
pension fund under the control of the Secretary of
War The Secretary placed it m the Bank of the
United States, not asa place ofdeposite, but as the
agent for disbursing the fund The Secretaiy had
no contiolover the money. Why has the ques-
tion been given to the Attorney General> Because
it was a question of the construction of a law
The Committee of Ways and Means had nothing
to do with the question, because the money had
long since been appropriated.
Mr WAYNE expressed the opinion that the
duties assigned to the Committee of Ways and
Means related to the appropriation of money, and
to the proper and legal disbursement of the money
appropriated Now the question arose, under the
law of 1832, who should make the disbursement,
and it fell upon the Committee of Ways and Means
to considei how the money was to be disbursed in
conformity with the law The disbursement of a
fund was necessanly connected with the subject of
the revenue, and therefore belonged to the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means
Mr LANE said that, upon examination, he had
found tuat the question presented by the message
was intimately connected with the subjects here-
tofore leferred to the Committee of Ways and
Means    He understood  the 57th  rule of the j
House to devolve this subject expressly upon that j
committee   By the57th rule it was made the duty I
of the Committee of Ways and Means " to ex- !
'amine particularly into the laws making appro- |
' puations of moneys, and to report whether the
'moneys have been disbursed corfoimably with
'such laws "    If this wa' a controversy whether
one or another should disbuise the pension fund,
it belonged, by the very letier of the iule, to the
Committee of Ways and Means     The C3J rule
assigns duties to the Committee on the Judiciary
touching all judicial proceedings   Wouidanyone
say that this was a judicial quest on—whether
money was to be disoursed by A or B'    It was
said that the Piesiüent had sent the papers here
without motive     He was very happy to hear it
acknowledged for once that the President had sent
us documents   without  any unworthy motives
The gentleman from Pennsylvania says that the
communication from   the nresident of tke bank
is full, clear, and candid    Yes, sir, all that comes
fiom the bank is pure and unsullied as snow
Mi JONES, of Georgia, considers the subject
a judicial question, ausing fiom the construction
ot an act of Congress—whether the bank is the
propel disbursing agent, and is legally empowered
to pay the pensions ordered Jl is neithei more
nor less than this There is no question concern-
ing a sum to be raised, nor any concerning an ap-
propriation to be laised, but whefher some other
(.ffiVtio shall be elected to pay the pensions
The President's call on the At'orney General for
a legal opinion, shows that in his judgment at least
it is a legal question, requiring a legal investiga-
tion Had it been a question of finance, the Sec-
retary of the Treasuiy,not the Attoiney General,
would have been called on to expiess an opinion
This is, theiefore, a presumptive proof that the
question is within the peculiar jurisdict on of the
Committee on the Judiciary, not the Committee of
Ways and Means
He regrets that his friends, or those with whom
he votes and concurs m opinion on the deposite
question, ¡should intermingle this subject with that
He considers it better not to have them ei tangled
By the bank charter, the Secretary of the Ireas-
ury has fu'l power to remove the deposites from
the United States Bank, if he assigns sufficient
reasons for his so doing But the present subject
is, whether ore officer or agent shall be preferred
to another
The Committee of Ways and Means have such
an accumulation of b ismess befoie them, that they
will not have time, even if they have inclination,
to devote that attention requisite to the pension
agercy of the bank With that committee it must
necessarily be but auxiliary to the mam question,
which would be reported on perhaps previously to
consiaering this question, and 'he pension agency
must be suspended in the interval But when it
is exhibited as an isolated question, consigned to
the Judiciary Committee, who have less business
on hand, it will receive proper and prompt atten-
tion.
Mr BEARDSLEY thinks that a due consider-
ation of the rules of the House which explain the
proper functions of the several standing commit-
tees, would point to the committee under whose
jurisdiction this subject more immediately comes.
The objectof the Judiciary Committee is stated in
the 6Jd rule to be limited to judicial proceedings.
Now there is no topic of that kind before the
House, no judicial proceedings in any court, nor
any action oí that nature, to obtain the moneys and
papers withheld by the bank from the Secretary
of War, and as there are not now any judicial
proceedings, the House cannot contemplate any.
If the Executive desired to institute an action on
the subject, there is already sufficient power in-
vested in the Government for the recovery of all
moneys, &c , due to it. Its authority being now
ample, no additional will be required, and as it
has not been thought proper to appeal to judicial
proceedings under this authority, no such pro-
ceedings can be contemplated by an appeal to Con-
gress to arm the Government with further powers.
The bank has received an appropriation of
$,500,000 for the pension agency fund. The con-
trol over this fund has been given to the Secretary
of War, who has the appointment of what agents
he pleases in the management of the concerns of
his department If the oank will not pay the pen-
sions which will be payable in March, and refuses
to submit to a transfer of the pension fund, then
must Congiess be required to order another appro-
pi lation for that purpose. This is suiely not the
business of the Committee on the Judiciary, nor
of the Committee on Pensions, nor of any other
committee but that of Ways and Means By the
57th rule, the func'ions of this last committee
extend to the control of everything relating to col-
lecting, keeping, and appiopnating the íevenues
or moneys of the nation This committee is to
decide concerning tne means of raising revenue,
and the mode whereby it is expended The ~ub-
j ct is therefore stnctly refeiable to theCommittee
of Ways and Means
Mr McKINLEY asserted that the question
really is, the junsdictionof the respective commit-
tees. Now every executive department is account-
able to the Committee of Ways and Means for
the due discharge of its duties, and this committee
is to investigate every transaction relative to the
receipts and expenditures of the national Treasury.
Were the question one on an action to recover
money, it might belong to the Judiciary Commit-
tee But where it involves the accountability of
an agent in the disbursement of the public funds,
it is a question propeily within the cognizance of
of the Committee of Ways and Means
Mr BELL, of Tennessee, explained He stated
that the alternative of reference should be decided
only according to the object contemplated by the
íeference It the House merely sought to have
an investigation of a legal question, and to have
an opinion expressed in a report of a committee
on that subject, then should the reference be made
to the Juoiciary Committee But if something
farthei, if legislative action consequent on a legal
investigation be requned, then should the refei-
ence be to the Committee of Ways and Means
So, if it is only to try who is wiong m the con-
stiuction of the act relative to the agency of the
pension fund, still it is the piovmce of the Judici-
ary Committee, but if it is to tiy wh thet the bank
shall continue us agency, or if it is thought neces-
sary to change the paying agerts and officers of
the pension fund in accoidante with the new fiscal
arrangeme-its contemplated by the Executive Gov-
ernment, then the subject devolves on the Commit-
tee of Ways and Means, for to this committee,
not to any other, belongs the question of agency
in all matters affecting the national revenue To
continue former agents, oi appoint new ones, be-
longs more properly to the Committee of Ways
and Means than to the Judiciary Committee.
Mi BR1GGS moved that the first two pages of
the President's message be read, which was done
accordingly.
Mr DENNY submitted an amendment to in-
struct the Committee of Ways and Means to
report a bill requinng the Secieta"-/ of War to
