III. In view of the rapid extension of steamboat navigation into disloyal State, and the importance of having the boats engage in such navigation controlled by loyal citizens, it is ordered that all licenses to pilots and engineers navigating the waters of the military department be revoked from and after the 15th proximo, and that said pilots and engineers take out new licenses from the "supervising inspector," who will only grant licenses to persons of approved loyalty; or, in case of doubt, will require bond with security for the loyal conduct of such engineers and pilots.
