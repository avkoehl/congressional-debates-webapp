Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

General Tyler informs me that the rebel force reported at Adamstown Tuesday night turns out to be three thieves-probably citizens of the vicinity. He says that our lines are insufficiently guarded is apparent, and the railroad is subject to assault any hour. As soon as the Fifth Massachusetts returns from Eastern Shore, I will send him four companies; there are no other troops to spare; the few are constantly employed guarding prisoners, recruits, &amp;c., going to the front. I would respectfully state that the term of service of five regiments expires this month.
