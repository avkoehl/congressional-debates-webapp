A large number of horses, supposed to be artillery horses, observed daily being taken to water in the vicinity of Pocahontas, have not been since last Saturday.

Commanding Second Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you relieve the cavalry picket-line from the plank road to the vicinity of Davenport Church. The cavalry picket-line crosses the plank road near the church. The Ninth Corp will picket on the right of the plank road-that is, the right looking south. The cavalry will picket from Davenport Church toward the James. The exact point of connection with the cavalry should be mutually agreed upon. These directions are to be carried out immediately.
