MURFREESBOROUGH, February 22, 1863.

Brigadier-General CROOK, Nashville, Tenn.:

Proceed up the river, and you will meet the two gunboats already there. Will give gunboat instructions through you. Think it would be expedient to go to Celina, and, taking ample provisions, operate by was of Livingston, Jamestown, Fentress County, and Monticello to Norman's Landing. You will have to watch the river that it does not get too low, and use your best judgment as to your course.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

MURFREESBOROUGH, February 22, 1863.

MURFREESBOROUGH, TENN.,

February 23, 1863 - 5 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK:

Your plan for uniting the two engineer corps meets my hearty concurrence. I urged the matter on General Totten two years ago. It will be a public benefit, and would not do much injustice to any one.

Brigadier-General BOYLE:

The rebels have entered the State by Somerset. They are said to be 2,500 strong, and going on from Mount Vernon to Richmond. The troops under Colonel Runkle, some 2,000, fell back this morning from Crab Orchard to this place, at 1 o'clock, and left at daylight, by Lancaster, for Richmond. Full particulars by letter. This I have from Colonel Runkle's mouth. The rebels are in command of [R. S.] Cluke and [R. M.] Gano.
