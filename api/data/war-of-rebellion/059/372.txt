LEXINGTON, KY., April 15, 1864.

General HOBSON:

Mr. Salyer, said to be a rebel by Union citizens, says he came through Pound Gap seven days ago with Hodge, who had 3,000 men; he saw General Breckinridge, who went back to Abingdon to bring up more men. Says John Morgan was at Abingdon, and that the officers and men seemed certain that they were merely the advance of a heavy force.

C. J. TRUE,

Colonel.

Two of my regiments are beyond Mount Sterling.

Had I best send another company to Glasgow? I do not think one is sufficient there.

J. W. WEATHERFORD,

Colonel Thirteenth Kentucky Cavalry.

MOUNT STERLING, April 15, 1864.

Brigadier-General HOBSON:

Colonel Brown has arrived. I do not believe there are any rebels this side of West Liberty, from best information. My regiment has moved to Mud Lick. Will move as rapidly as possible to West Liberty, or best point to get enemy's rear. Will Colonel Brown move forward to support me or not?

C. J. TRUE,

Colonel.

LEXINGTON, KY., April 15, 1864.

Colonel C. J. TRUE,

Mount Sterling:

Colonel Brown will move forward and co-operate with your reg- iment, leaving one company at Mount Sterling. If you should meet large force advancing, be guided by verbal instructions in possession of Colonel Brown. Send often by courier to Mount Sterling all information to be telegraphed from that point.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.
