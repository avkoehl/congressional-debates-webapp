Major-General SHARIDAN:

I have received the following dispatch from commanding officer of the Sixth Pennsylvania Cavalry, picketing the Potomac River:

My orders from General Torbert were to stop all persons who were not furnished with passes from General Sheridan, as well as to arrest smugglers and deserters.

A. P. MORROW,

Captain, Commanding Sixth Pennsylvania Cavalry.

These orders I should like to have changed, as they cause me much trouble, and are clearly not such as you contemplated.

Respectfully,

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
