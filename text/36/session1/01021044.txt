THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 7,
and a republican Government to be put in opera-
tion, the wise men of that day, knowing that the
eyes of the world were upon them, and that thepre-
dictions of the Monarchists and absolutists of the
Old World were, that this was a Utopian scheme
that would not be aarried into practice, and that
the then infant Republic would soon crumble to
atoms, endeavored to guard and protect every in-
terest, and prevent internal strife and division.
The manner of raising revenue for the support
of the new Government was a matter of great con-
cern. Various propositions were made and fully
discussed. Should there be a tax upon land?
Should the tax be on imports, or should they tax
exports ?
The principal discussion was between the two
latter propositions. Tobacco was then an article
of considerable export. Cotton had not yet as-
sumed any importance as an article of trade; in
fact, it was about the year 1790 that,the planters
of the southern States began to turn their atten-
tion to raising it, and not until 1795 that Mr.
Whitney invented the cotton gin. In 1784, eight
bags of cotton from one of our southern States,
consigned to Mr. Rathbone, an American mer-
chant in Liverpool, were seized by the custom-
house officers, on the allegation that it could not
have been grown in the United States—so insig-
nificant and unknown was the production of this
great staple at that time, although now denomi-
nated king. I refer to this for the purpose of
showing that, had the cotton interest then been
what it is now, one section of our country having
an entire monopoly of its production, that vast
interest might have decided differently the ques-
tion of taxing exports; and the producers of cotton,
who now object so strenuously to taxing imports,
so as to protect the American manufacturer, might
have been paying tax upon their exports.
What did the great men who framed the Con-
stitution say on this subject? In volume three of
the Madison Papers, page 1339:
"Mr. Ma son urged the necessity of connecting u'Jth the
powers of levying taxes, duties, &c., tlie prohibition m ar-
ticle six, section lour, ' That no tax should be l.tul on ex-
poits.' He was umvilline to trust to its being done 111 future.
He hoped the northern States did not mean to deny the
southern tins security. It would hereafter be as desirable
to the former, when the latter shoutd become the most
populous. He professed his jealousy for the productions
of the southern, or, as he called them, the staple States.
He moved to insert the lollowmg amendment:
"v Provided, That no tax, duty, or impost, shall be laid
by the Legislature of the United States on articles exported
from any State.'
" Mr. "Gouverneur Morris considered sueli a proviso
inadmissible anywhere ; it was radically objectionable ;
that it might cost the whole system the support of some of
(ts members. He contended that it would not, in some
eases, l?E equitable to tax imports without taxing exports;
and that taxes on exports would often he the most easy and
pioper of the two.
" Mr. Madison. First, the power of laying taxes on ex-
ports is proper in itself; and as the States cannot with pro-
priety exercise it separately, it ought to be vested in them
collectively. Secondly, it might with particular advant-
age be exercised with regard to articles in which Amei-
ica was not rivaled in foreign markets ; as tobacco, See "
* * * '• Fourthly, the southern States, being most in
danger, and most needing naval protection, could the less
complain if the burden should be somewhat heaviest on
them. And, finally, we are not providing for the present
moment only; and time will equalize the situations of the
States m this matter. He was, for these reasons, against
the motion."
On page 1384, Gouverneur Morris says:
" The state of the country, also, will change, and render
duties on exports, as skin*, beaver, and other raw materials,
politic, in the view of encouraging American manufac-
tures.''
Mr. Fitzsimmons, on page 1386—
" Was for giving the power to lay the tax when a proper
time may call for it. This would certainly be the case
when America should become a manufacturing country."
On page 1388, on the question "No tax shall
be laid on exports," it was carried in the affirma-
tive—seven States voting yea, four voting nay—
General Washington and Mr. Madison, of Vir-
ginia, voting no.
With such authority as Washington and Mad-
ison in favor of taxing exports, it cannot be de-
nied that withholding the power to tax them was
a concession to the South, and one that would
probably nothave been made,had the production
of cotton to any considerable extent then existed'.
Now, we do not ask for a tax upon exports, hut
we do ask our southern friends, who enjoy the
exemption, to give us such duties upon imports
as wil! equalize our condition and encourage
American manufactures. We ask that the duties
shall be so laid as to afford incidental protection,
and not as recommended by the Secretary of the
Treasury in his report on the finances, made to
Congress at its last session. In that report, the
Secretary says:
" I do not deem it proper to enter into any extended dis-
cussion of the theoretic principles on which a tariff act
should be framed. They may be briefly stated. Such du-
ties should be laid as will produce the revenue required, by
imposing on the people atlarge the smallest and most equal
burdens.
" It Is obvious that this is most effectually done by tax-
ing, in preference to others, such articles as are not pro-
duced in this country; and among articles produced here,
those in which the home product bears the least proportion
to tlie quantity impoited, are the fittest for taxation."
Such is the language, such the recommendation
of the financial officer of the present Administra-
tion. I regretthat it was reserved forthe Admin-
istration of a native (and once " the favorite son")'
of Pennsylvania to recommend the raising of rev-
enue by taxing articles not manufactured in this
country, and, of course, exempting from taxation
those articles that come in competition with our
own labor and products. How does this corre-
spond with theaoctrinesof Washington, Adams,
Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and Jackson? 1
will not encumber my argument by quoting from
their different messages; it has been done so fre-
quently, that their doctrines of protecting and fos-
tering the manufactures of our own country arc
like household words, known to all intelligent
minds. I will, however, give an4 extract from
the message of President Monroe to Congress,
December 2, 1823:
" Having communicated my views to Congress, at the
commencement of the last session, respecting the encour-
agement which ought to be given tu our manufactures, and
the principle on which it should be founded, T have only
to add that those views remain unchanged; and that tlie
present state of those countries with which we have the
most immediate political relations and greatest commercial
intercoms!; tends to confirm them. Under this impression,
I recommend a review of tlie tarilfTorthe purpose of afford-
ing such additional protection to tiio-c articles which we
are prepared to manufacture, or which aie more imme-
diately connected with llle defense and independence ofthe
country."
What different language from that used by Mr.
Secretary Cobb! This, the enlarged view of an
American statesman; that, a blind and narrow
policy, destructive to American interests. But
would such blind policy promote even the sec-
tional interests intended to be benefited ? I con-
tend not, sir. We are members of one great
family, when one suffers, the others must sym-
pathize to a certain extent; and when one pros-
pers and flourishes, the effect is felt by all.
Mr. Chairman,why will we not be admonished
by experience? Why not derive wisdom from
the past? What has been the result of high tariffs
and of low tariffs, m this country and in other
countries ? This information is accessible to all.
It has been spread before Congress very fre-
quently and very ably, and I almost shrink from
the effort of again reciting it; but, in the language
of the late Mr. Benton, " that the truth of history
maybe vindicated,"I will briefly refer to it. The
result has been that, under protective tariffs, the
country has been prosperous, money plentiful,
labor fully employed and compensated; the in-
dustrious, frugal mechanic, artisan, or laborer,
no t only subsisting himself and family, but becom-
ing the freeholder; building his own house, and
residing in it with his family; cultivating his own
soil, and perhaps in turn becoming the employer,
the capitalist, the manufacturer, and finding
labor and sustenance forthe scores of human be-
ings that would gather around him. On the other
hand, low or strictly revenue tariffs have flooded
the country with foreign ^oods,foreign iron, for-
eign everything; have drained us of our precious
metals to pay for them; have put out the fires of
our forges and furnaces; stopped the shuttle and
the loom; sent consternation, poverty, distress,
and even starvation, into our manufacturing dis-
trict; and the hardy, able-bodied laborer, after
spending wearisome day s and nights in vai n search
of employment, has been doomed to penury and
want, and forced to beg, or starve. The value of
all property, real and personal, has been greatly
reduced; and few or no buyers at the sheriffs'
sales, which are the legitimate resultof this course
of policy. Has this not been the case ? Is it not
a true picture of the past? And will not the same
course produce the same effect in the future ?
From 1812 to 1815, during the war with Great
Britain, when our foreign commerce was suspend-
ed, and it became a necessity for us to manufac-
ture and produce at home what would supply our
wants, we became a nation of exchangers or bar-
tered. The manufacturer turned out his iron,
glass, salt, cotton and woolen goods, which lie
exchanged for labor, mechanical skill, and the
products of the soil. The farmer had a home
market; the producer and consumer were " en-
abled to take their place by each other's side;"
the laborer had constant employment and good
wages, and at the close of an expensive and te-
dious war with the most powerful nation on the
globe, we were prosperous and happy, with a
revenue that was fast diminishing the public
debt. The tariff of 1816, which superseded the
doable or war duties of 1812, (which were con-
tinued to June 30, 1817,) was essentially a rev-
enue tariff only, without protection. Under its
operation, foreign goods flowed into the country;
the product of foreign labor was substituted for
our own, whilst our own labor was doomed to
languish and seek employment in vain; the prod-
ucts of our farmers, instead of feeding labor at
home, were sent to Europe to nourish foreign
labor, and bo returned to us in manufactured ar-
ticles; whilst our minerals were lying dead and
useless in the hills, and the laborers starving for
want of bread.
The tariffs of 1824, and then of 1828, by their
protective principles, again restored us to pros-
perity. This continued until we began to feel the
depressing influence of the compromise tariff of
1833, as it approached the free-trade standard. The
period now under consideration is not so remote
but that the majority of this House can well re-
member it. The suspension of specie payments
by the banks occurred in 1837; and the general
depression and bankruptcy that pervaded every
branch of business, and the large majority of busi-
ness men, was such, that Congress found it neces-
sary, in 1841, to pass a general bankrupt law, that
the large number of useful, active business men,
who had been carried into banlyuptcy by that
"irrepressible conflict" against labor, might be
restored to position and usefulness.
There was no relief to tlie country, no improve-
ment in commerce or manufactures, until the pro-
tective tariff of 1842 gave us a new impetus, and
prosperity again shone upon us.
Prom 1843 to 1847, our exports and imports of
specie were:

The tariff of 1846 found the country in a high
stateof prosperity. Its baneful effects werenotfclt
immediately, but like the slow and sure poison,
it has been quietly and regularly sapping the foun-
dations of our prosperity, reducing the amountof
our manufactures, increasing the amount of our
importations, robbing us of our precious metals,
and again reducing us to a state of dependency,
or rather despondency—I might say both. One
evidence of the extent of this blight upon our
prosperity, is the fact that from 1848 to 1859, in-
clusive, twelve years, our exports of coin and
bullion exceed the imports $371,750,884, or an
average of more than thirty million dollars per
annum:
