WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, December 22, 1864-9 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS,

In the Field:

I have seen to-day General Halleck's dispatch of yesterday and your reply. It is proper for me to assure you that this Department has the most unbounded confidence in your skill, vigor, and determination to employ to the best advantage all the means in your power to pursue and destroy the enemy. No Department could be inspired with more profound admiration and thankfulness for the great deeds you have already performed, or more confiding faith that human effort could accomplish no more than will be done by you and the gallant officers and soldiers of your command.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

Let us push and do all we can before the enemy can derive benefit either from the raising of negro troops or the concentration of white troops now in field.

U. S. GANT,

Lieutenant-General.
