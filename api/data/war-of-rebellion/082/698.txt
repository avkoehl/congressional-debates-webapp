move suddenly I will have to take off the troops in the rifle-pits, but there is no necessity of doing so before, and then you will have sufficient notice, except in case of attack, which you will hear of before I do (I have no telegraph). The best place for your camps along the rifle-pits is where my three brigades are, dividing the line into three parts. There are wells dug there. I sent you a staff officer to show where my troops are, and to see that they were relieved, as yours may be ready to go in.

Truly, yours,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 31, 1864-2 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I have received the order to occupy the line from the plank road to the Norfolk railroad. Is it not designed for me to occupy also the redoubt this side of the railroad and to establish the picket-line from the plank road to be railroad? If so, General Cutler's division will only make a thin line, but I suppose enough till he can be re-enforced.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 31, 1864-2.30 p. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

The direction to occupy the line from the plank road to the Norfolk road was intended to include the redoubt you refer to and the establishment of the picket-line. The commanding general does not consider it necessary to place the troops in the rifle-pits. They may be kept massed at convenient points near by, from which they could be thrown rapidly into the pits if necessary, or moved elsewhere if required. The redoubts should be occupied.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 31, 1864.

General S. WILLIAMS:

I can send one of my brigades to relieve Hancock's, as ordered, at once, by daylight. I am waiting, however, for an answer to a dispatch to General Humphreys about the redoubt and picket-line. Perhaps he is not in.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.
