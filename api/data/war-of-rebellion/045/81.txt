HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,June 13, 1863-9 a. m.

Major-General HOOKER,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

Butterfield's dispatch just received. The negroes say Ewell took the road to Sperryville. They were all travelling the same way. I am pushing reconnaissances in that direction. Ask Ingalls if he got my dispatch about Mosby.

A. PLEASONTON,

Brigadier-General.

JUNE 13, 1863.

Commanding Officer Cavalry Corps:

When will you hear from your scouts? We ought to hear from both routes from Culpeper to Thornton's Gap, Chester Gap, and New Baltimore. If their columns have passed trough Culpeper in that direction, you must post us very quickly when and where they went.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD.

Major-General, and Chief of Staff.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 13, 1863-9. 10 a. m.

General REYNOLDS:

After receiving all information you can from Pleasonton, post your command in the best position possible to accomplish prevention of enemy's movements, whatever they may be. It is probable that a movement is on foot turn our right or go into Maryland. The information is not of such a settled character as to warrant abandonment of this line, but still it will need watching at your end. When it is settled, then we must concentrate at once, one way or the other; as it is, our line is necessarily extended and consequently weak. The general's instructions require him to cover Washington and Harper's Ferry. To do this and hold the Fredericksburg line are impossibilities, if the enemy move as last year. We cannot abandon this line on any uncertainty. With this understanding, you can act more advisedly. Bealeton was named as a central point for supplies and for an appui until their movements are determined. Change it, if necessary, and advise the general.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
