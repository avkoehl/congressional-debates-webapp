General S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

The two deserters reported as having come into our lines this morning turn out to be a young man who belongs to the Third Virginia cavalry, Wickham's brigade, now in the Shenandoah Valley, he having been detached to get horses some three mjonths ago about his home, seven miles west of Reams' Station. He has brought his wife in with him; both young persons. They are more properly refugees, and should have been detained upon the picket-line; but these exceptional cases do appear to be beyond the discretion of the picket officers. Shall they be sent forward?

Major-General, Commanding.
