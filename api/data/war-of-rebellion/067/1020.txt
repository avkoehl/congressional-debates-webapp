from right and left and the men thoroughly exhausted, were in time forced to retire taking position behind the crest of a slight elevation, some 50 or 75 yards in front of their works, holding our position until re-enforced by portions of the Forty-seventh and Forty-eighth New York, Colonel Barton's brigade, when we again advanced under a heavy fire, and succeeded in capturing their works, taking more prisoners, advancing some 200 yards beyond their lines. The exact number of prisoners captured by any one regiment can not be arrived at with any degree of accuracy, the regiments being so intermingled. I should judge, however, that the prisoners taken by my regiment were from 75 to 100. While not wishing to detract from the honor or praise of any regiments I claim that my regiment was the first into the woods, and the colors of the Ninth Maine the first to be planted on the entrenchments. That to Colonel Barton's brigade belongs the credit of the capture I deny, as emphatically as I deny that to Ricketts' division belongs the credit that should be given to yours.

I forwarded report as directed by you, but not until the day you retired from the front, and it has probably been mislaid at brigade headquarters. I also notified the commanding officers of the regiments in brigade as you desired, and the reports made and given to Lieutenant W. L. Hughes, acting assistant adjutant-general.
