Brigadier-General WHIPPLE:

(Through General Rousseau.)

Prepositions have been made to me by reliable parties to raise companies of men in the mountains south of here for our service as home guards. Three hundred men could be organized in this way. Could I be authorized to give them assurance of support from us if they are hard pressed and obliged to fall back o n this point, and such other assistance as I may deem safe? I receive this information form my scouts, perfectly reliable men, who have given me all the information sent by me to the general commanding.
