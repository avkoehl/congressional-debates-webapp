ments? Send up any contrabands, prisoners, or others that have any important information, letting me know what it is by orderly as soon as possible. Send up the contraband you found at Armstrong's Mill at once; mount him to get him up quickly.

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,December 9, 1864.

Major General N. A. MILES:

GENERAL: The contraband knew nothing of Mahone. He did not know where Heth and Wilcox were going, only that they were moving on the Boydton plank road. I gather from what he said that he saw them on the Boydton plank road nearly a mile or two beyond Hatcher's Run. It seems probable Mahone struck the Boydton plank road beyond where the contraband was.

HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, SECOND ARMY CORPS,December 9, 1864-10.05 p.m.

Major S. CARNCROSS, Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: As the order directing the movement of this division made to-day gave no instructions for further operations, I respectfully ask for instructions for my guidance.

Very respectfully,

N. A. MILES,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

Brevet Major-General MILES:

You will be directed to return to-morrow afternoon, unless some changes take place in the condition of affairs. Keep your cavalry to the front to-morrow and have a bridge built over Hatcher's Run suitable for wagons, if practicable. Please show this to General Wheaton, as he will be directed to return at the same time you do.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,December 9, 1864-1.30 a.m.

Major-General GIBBON, Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: The commanding general directs that you send a brigade of your division to take the place of General Miles' division just before daylight this morning, General Miles having been ordered to make a reconnaissance across Hatcher's Run on the Boydton road.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

September CARNCROSS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
