by boat, and then with both commands cross the Missouri at Berthold and march to the hostile camp. With this force I could whip them badly and driven them south, where they would fall into the hands of troops marching from Laramie. My present force is too small for this. I would have to fight ten to my one. It would be all I could do to defend myself successfully; and if I marched against them and did not succeed in totally routing them as I have heretofore, all our past labors would be thrown away, and we would have a worse state of affairs in this country than we have ever had. When I organized my force for this campaign I was ordered to march via the Big Cheyenne to Powder River; there I would meet troops from Laramie. I was ordered to deal with such hostile Sioux as I should meet. I had no idea of having on my hands not only the hostile Sioux but all the Cheyennes and Arapahoes, against whom a large force is now marching from Laramie. I doubt much, however, if they will be able to reach them.

With much respect, Your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,New Orleans, La., July 16, 1865.

Brevet Brigadier-General CONRAD,

Commanding Second Division:

As soon as Your division or any portion of it arrives at Indianola, You will cause it to be immediately moved out from the coast, on the road to Victoria, to the nearest good camp where wood and water can be obtained, and to go into camp. You should either send a staff officer or the brigade commander by one of the first boats so this can be attended to immediately, and proper camping ground selected. General Wood is already there, and whatever goes had better see him in regard to locality of their camp. The most stringent measures must be adopted by yourself and subordinate commanders to prevent the destruction of private property, and officers and men must be made to understand that any damage done will be stopped against their pay. On arrival at Indianola call on General Wood for some of Your transportation to enable You to get rations back from the coast.

By command of Major-General Stanley:

WM. H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

General CONRAD,

Commanding Second Division:

Instead of moving out on the Victoria road with Your division on arrival at Indianola, if You can get steam-boats take Your command right up to Lavaca and march from there to Your camps. Report to General Wood on Your arrival there and he will designate to You the best locality for a camp.

By command of Major-General Stanley:

WM. H. STANLEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
