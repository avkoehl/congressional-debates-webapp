such -was the case He had merely put a case hypothetical i y,
*ad had supposed, for the argument's sake, that such might be
the case]
Mr & then observed that be should not say what he had in
tended He had understood the gentleman as intimating that
there wore certain prejudices m the mmd of the piesident of the
board, which went te invalidate the report
It was true, ass stated, that the Committee on Expenditures
had called on the Executive for the report on the 9th of Febrn
ary, but the Senate had done the same m January, he believed,
or on some day m February, but no answer had been obtained
The committee,   behevag,  on sufficient grounds   that the
greatest source of political iniquity and corruption m the whole
country ex s ed m the New York custom house, had desired to
look into the actual state of the expenditures in. that establish
merit, and they had ace >rdmgly railed on the President and on
the Secretary of the Treasury fofthe report in regard to i    But
they had called m vain, and therefo\e they had concluded ¡o
subpc&nct the commissioner himself before them, enjoining him
to bring a copy of his report with him   which he had «-'one ac
cordingly    He bad submitted die ieport and all the testimony
The gentleman from Maryland [Mr Johnson] had tal ked about,
suppre^mg the testtii ony   and the inj arm i^ consequenre of
sending forth the repoit without the testimony on which it was
founded  But nn testimony had been suppressed, it v. as ail there
if any had been withheld it had been because it was in the re
portof one of the other cnrnmi sioneis.
As to thedelay, of which so much has b-en said, thecomms
sioner would have been able to repoit at a much eailiei day
but for the stumbling blocks perpetually thrown m his wav
There were some fourteen folio voltimes of n anu&mptcoires
pondence which had been withheld from him till February
but since he obtained them, he had ma le such ««¡e of his t me,
and had exhibited an amount of talent and industry, that would,
amongaM Government defaulters hereafter, make the Pom
dexter gun" a  much dreaded as the famous ' Paixhan gun ' of
the navy
Ihegentleman fiom Vjrginnhad pronounced a pretty naish
censure (among all his fine compliment^) on the commissioner
for submitting his report to a committee of Congre s when he
was the agent of the Piesi lent And the gentleman had asked,
irt a very lordly tone, how the committee could know that any
such report had been made to the Secretary oi to the Prt-q
dent? Mr S would, m turn, mqjire how aid the genHf^rtan
from Virginia know the reason5* of the President ol the IÍ jited
Suites ami his Secretary oí the Treasury for hoMme back this
repoit after the repeated calls of Congress? The gentleman
hid infoimed the House that the Piesident wan'ed the report
that he might make out from it a message to Congress (and
this, though he had not read one w ord of it aftei having kt pt it
ten days )   How, pray did the gentleman know7
f he commi sioner had made a dupluaie copy of the report
and testimony, and the commissioner doubtless had ^ood rei
son to know whv

IA Voice    "How did you get that letter? J
Mt Lin\ The letter is part of a correspondence between
the commissioner^and the President, and forms a part of the
report ]                                              ,                                  ,
Mr feTANLY That letter was the moving cause with me
for desiring to pursue a course which should bring this report
to public notice I do most solemnly believe that, if the com
mittee had not sent for the report, many of the facts there de
veloped * ould never have seen the day Why did the President
assume the very extraordmaiy power of reserving to himself
certain portions of a public document obtained by him a-, the
Chief Magistrate, under a power to see that the laws are duly
executed, and submitting just such \ onions of it as he pleaded
to Congress? He had no ngnt to make any such reseivat ons
Was it for his own private purposes lhat he was to employ
public officers atso much a day out of the Tieasuiy and clothe
them with powers of investigation which others fteiecompelled
to obey'i Was it that he migl t be able to say to certain gent e
men in ceitam quarters, ' 1 have you m my powet, I want a
few votes in \ourhtate, an 1 if you dont get ihem for me I'll
blow you all sky hi«h'" Why paid Mr S , if I had suppressed
such a document as this I should have thought I deserved to be
censured as out of ihe pecuhai ft tend  of this Administra ion,
