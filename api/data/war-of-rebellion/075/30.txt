you to effect a junction with General McPherson and report to him. You will have a mountainous road, but will save full twenty miles in distance and reach McPherson full a day sooner than by following around by Chattanooga, the road being full of troops and wagons. Let your train of artillery and wagons follow by Chattanooga, attaching it to some train of Logan's troops that are just ahead of you. You will need five days' rations and as much forage as you can carry and pack. On your route you will find grass but no forage. Wagons can travel that road but you will be more bothered by them than by want of forage.

Take a good feed at starting and the nose-bag of oats or corn must suffice until you come to your wagons near Gordon's Springs. If you have pack animals they could be brought over the mountain. Make the men lead up and down the mountain. We are forced to act at once and may need your services soon after reaching McPherson. Have your ordered the other brigade to follow you? General Corse will bring you a good map and will accompany you.

General ROUSSEAU,

Nashville, Tenn.:

General Granger declines a brigade in Palmer's corps. I cannot give him higher command. If any regiments are sent to Nashville by reason of the call of the militia, you could probably make up a camp of instruction for him similar to that of Schurz; 5,000 men would be enough fro any one camp. I will depend on you to open communications to us in case of any break.

Major-General SHERMAN,

I go to Red Clay this afternoon. Will have my troops all there to-morrow, except those from Kentucky, and will be ready to move on the morning of the 6th.

General SCHOFIELD,

Cleveland, Tenn.:

Move to Red Clay and keep connection with Thomas' left. Send back and hurry up the Kentucky regiments. McPherson arrived last night, and half of his troops will be here to-night. Garrard's cavalry is now passing the mountain this side of Cowan. Thomas has gone to the front at Ringgold.
