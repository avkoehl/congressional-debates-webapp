HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION,Camp near Licking Creek, August 26, 1862-9.40 a. M.

General BIRNEY,

Second Brigade:

GENERAL: The general commanding division directs [that] you move forward one of the regiments at Bealeton to the side of the advanced Maine regiment, so as to cover a greater extent of ground, at the same time advancing one of your regiments from the rear to Bealeton to supply its place. In the direction of Elkton you are pretty secure, as the outposts of Poe's brigade extend to the place, Poe having a regiment on the dirt road between his camp and Elkton. In case of attack you will fight the enemy near the river well to the front. A section of Randolph's battery will be posted with the detachment at Bealeton. You can use it to the front. The cavalry squadron will report to you as desired. Keep them well in a body to resist crossing. If small parties of the enemy cross, ambush and surround them. You will please inform these headquarters what regiments have been sent to the front.

Respectfully,

G. W. MINDIL,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
