WASHINGTON, D. C., July 9, 1863.

Brigadier General G. WRIGHT, San Francisco, Cal.:

GENERAL: You have the authority of the War Department to issue any arms you may deem necessary to the organized militia of your department; but such issues must be regarded not as quota distributions, but liable to be called back whenever you deem it necessary for arming volunteers or other purposes. This arrangement will serve the double purpose of supplying the militia and having arms disposable for other purposes on the Pacific Coast.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK.

General-in-Chief.

WASHINGTON July 9, 1863.

Major General L. H. ALLEN, San Francisco, Cal.:

GENERAL: Your letter of June 8 is received. General Wright has full authority to issue arms to the militia where he deems it proper, but such issues are not to be considered as a quota distribution, but as liable to be recalled whenever found necessary for arming volunteers or militia called into the service of the United States. The exigencies of the public service at present are such as to prevent quota distribution. All arms that can be purchased or manufactured must be held available for the use of troops mustered into service.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
