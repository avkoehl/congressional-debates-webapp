when they reach there. The enemy were fighting McCausland's and Jackson's cavalry, twelve miles from Gordonsville, this afternoon. It is absolutely necessary that your troops should march at once and be at Gordonsville by daylight. Everything depends on your promptness. The transportation will be ready at midnight. General Corse will communicate with, and co-operate with, Generals McCausland and Jackson. General Lee directs that the troops be at Gordonsville before day, and that if the enemy has not crossed the Rapidan River, they should march to Liberty Mills. Acknowledge receipt of this.

HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,December 22, 1864.

Major General C. W. FIELD,

Commanding Division:

You will order Bratton's brigade to prepare three days' cooked rations at once, and as soon as prepared order General Bratton to march to the Central railroad depot, in Richmond, to take the cars for Gordonsville. General Hunton's brigade, of Pickett's division, is also going to the same place. General Bratton will probably get off first. Arriving at Gordonsville, he will make disposition of his command to hold the place, and, on the arrival of General Hunton, will report to him. A force of the enemy, estimated to amount to about 4,000 cavalry, with four pieces of artillery, is supposed to be operation against Gordonsville. Cars will be ready for Bratton's troops by midnight. They will be gone about a week, and will leave guards in charge of all property left in camp. You can supply Bratton's place in your line in such way as you think most judicious. Notify me of the time they will be able to get off. Respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major General C. W. FIELD,

Commanding Division:

General Lee orders that our troops be at Gordonsville before day; the transportation will be ready at midnight. You will have Bratton's brigade in town by that time. Let Bratton send a staff officer into town at once to notify the railroad authorities of the time the brigade will be there. The enemy were fighting McCausland's and Jackson's brigades of cavalry twelve miles from Gordonsville this afternoon. General Corse will go up to take command of Bratton's and Hunton's brigades when they reach there. When General Bratton arrives he will communicate with and co-operate with McCausland and Jackson. Should the enemy not have crossed the Rapidan River General Lee wishes the troops to march to Liberty Mills. Everything depends on your promptness in getting Bratton off.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
