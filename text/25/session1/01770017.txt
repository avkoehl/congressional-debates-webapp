APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Postponement of fourth instalment—Mr. Brown.
Senate.
General Government Was it nothing, that it had
in thespacp of a few months past divided among
the States near thirty millions of dollar-,' Was the
distribution of thus immense amount among the
States, (for he regarded it, practically and in point
of fact, asa distribution) to be consideied nothing'
Or was it, m this act, that gentlemen found rea-
sons to complain of oppression, on the part of the
General Government, against the States' He
really thought, if gentlemen would take a dispas-
sionate rev iew of the conduct of the General Go-
vernment towards the States, in its pecuniary trans-
actions with them, if they did not find all their
most e Yira vagan t expections realized, the} would
at least find enough, in the magnitude oí the dis-
tribution which had been made, to exempt the Gene-
ral Govern nent from the harsh censure which
they had cast on it
The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr Crittenden)
has taken strong exceptions to what he has been
p'eascd to term the paternal advice given us by the
President, in his message, against the increasing
luxury and extravagance in the mode of living,
which <ue rapidly diffusing themselves throughout
our country, and thinks that it w ould hav c been
more becom ng him to have set an example of eco-
nomy and re rencnment, by the mtioduction of
those principles into his administration, before he
ventured his advice on such subjects It was true,
(-.aid Mr B ) that the President had, not in the way
of advice, as had been suggested by the gentleman,
but in tracing the causes which had led to the pre-
sent embairassed condition of the country, enume-
rated that, among many others, m connection with
the inflate 1 papei system existing in tms conn ry
and in Engla^ 1, w Inch actina ai d leading on each
other, have, in conjunction w íth the cause fust men-
tioned, ma1 nlv contsibnted to proticethf txisting
evils—evils v h ch nil cxpprieno in b 'heaun íes,
proves belong io t ic p rpei ^ste n, and penodici'ly
recur under it, no matter in whatfoitn it exists,
whcthei m the s^ape of a national bank or of Slate
institutions He would, howevei, before finishing
his reply to the censuie which had been cast on the
President for this remark, take the occasion to say
to tne gentleman from Kentucky if he would unite
in cairying out the recommendation of the Presi-
dent to vv ithhold the fourth instalment to the States,
that it would be taking a step of no little import-
ance towards bunging th  Government b?ck to eco-
nomy and i lienchracnt Th sate of tt> case be-
tween the v ew of the Pre id"i tpnd the gent Pinan
fiom Kentickv, in r°'ation to the measure al u ed
to by him, was simply this the President recom-
mend the passage of a Ian postponing the pay-
ment of the fo .rth instalment to the States, amount-
ing to some nine or ten milhons, and which the
Government, not having the means to satisty, ow-
ing to the def mlt of the deposite banks, will neces-
sarily, if paid, have to provide the means by going
in debt foi tnat sum whde the gentleman from
Kentucky moists on the payment of the instalment
to the States, the effect of which would be to com-
pel the Government to raise the necessary means,
either by an issue of Tieasurv notes or m some
other manner jNow he would submit it to the im-
partí ?1 decision ot any one to determine who was
for economy and retienchment, and who was for
extra vag in t expenditure—the President of the Uni-
ted Slates or the honorable Senator lumse f
Wt have be^n told vv ith much emphasis, said
Mr B that although Congress had been specially
convoked Ly the President, yet no measure of relief
had been recommended for the people, that it was
all foi the Government While he would say tl at
this dec ai at ion was unsusfatned by the character
of the measures recommendel in the Message of
the Chief Magistrate, he could not permit the occa-
sion to pass without the expression of Ins smceie
regret that language of that character had fallen
from any Senator on that fl oi The Gov eminent
of the TJn ted States had be=n spoken of as some-
thing al en to the p'ople w ho were its constituents.
Gentlemen surely forgot the pimciples and theoiy
of our Government, and imagined themselves en-
gaged in combating against a Government of irre-
sponsible powers, and claiming no origin from, or
sympathy with, the public will What, he would
ask, was the nature and character of that Govern-
ment, which it ip& m this way attempted to rouse
public prejudice against, and to induce the belief
that its interests were distinct from the great body
of the people 1 Was it not an emanation of that
popular will which it was now sought to turn
against it, imbued vv ith the same feelings, and inter-
woven with the best m ercsts and dearer i ghts of
the great body of the people' Was it to be regarded
as a crime, that means should be take i by those
sent here to legislate, and by the Executive, whose
province it was to se" that the laws are executed,
to continue the Government in us regular and
constitutional action' Heietofore, we had been
taught, that the prcseivation of our sy  m of
government in its constitutional acti i while
it was, by far, an object of highei interest and more
univeisal concernment than any other, to every
citizen, was, at the same time, the fust and highest
daty of patriotism Language of the kind, to
which he hadallul d, had unfirlun-tely been too
common amrng a certain po meal paity in this
countr) , the effect of it w as to pro luce dissatisfac-
tion in the pul 1 t mind, ml picpare the w<>y for
the overthrow ofoui Msimoi govenment by in-
ducing the impression that tbue is no ident t\ of

ment It was not the part of an American slate
man, m his humble judgment, to use language c l
dilated to bung the Government into di repule at
home, and to degrade it in the estimation of foreign-
ers thread
As to the idea of legislative iei ef to the country,
of which so much had been said mthe comseof this
debate, he mu>t con'' s-, that he hau but little fa th
in it It was ti te thatCo->°ressm °ht, and pioba-

not only impracticable, but at variance with the
pimciples of our Government What, he would
ask did gentlemen mean by the rebcf, which they
had so olten spoken ot in the conrsi of the de-
bate' Was it th it men should V legislate 1 out
of debt, who had most improi ilently plunged ml >
gamblm? speculations' Was it that banking cor-
porations should in some way be favored by oir
legislation, at the expense oí p il lie ri'lit ' Th y

the doctrine that m i been tan<*K nv th  highest and

He, therefore, repud ?ted the doctru e of legislative

He (Mr B ) did not sec in the condition of
the comtry the alarming symptoms and dan-
geroas crisis whea had been described in such
dark and gloomy colors, and which, however
well intended the motives doubtless were tint
prompted them, were but little calculated, ii
the piesent tremilous and sensitive state ofpun-
hc confidence, to allay the evils arising from
pecuniary embaíris,ment He did not believe fMt
the nation had fallen i no the " slough of despoi u"
as the gentleman irorn South Carolina (Mr Pres-
ton) nad ->_ u It was true that embarrassment
bad been seveiely felt m the commercial commu-
nity, and among other classes who had overtraded
and engaged in rmnojs speculations, but the great
mass oí substantial citizens, agriculturists and
others, he belie «red, were unaffected, except by the
banks hiving suspended specie payments, which
they had done w ith, he believed, a larger aggregate
pioportiou of spec e than they had at any time be-
for possessed Looking to the condition of our
country in contiast wila others, he saw no reason
to despm, but Tiuol to congratulate ourselves on
Wi n n i natío íal i h we glung on oui resources,
with a nopu1 m n p ssesse 1 to an unexampled de-
gtee, of the means ol hum? i subsistence and hap-
p ne-s, with a country of unlimited capacity ior

its wants and com'orts, and, above all, remember-
ing tnat our fiec and noble institutions yet sur-
vive w ho does not feel that we s.and in proud and
giattfy ng contrast with anvothei nation'
Checl ed in its prosperity, it might be, for a short
time, by the causes vv nch had operated on both sides
ofthe Atlantic to prolnc  in imprudent extension of

Many individuals, m commeicial and oiher pur-
sjiN, had fallen beneath the pies,ure of the
times, others perhaps would share the same
fate, property had and v ould, he did not doubt,
m very many more instances, change proprie-
tors, but it would still remain in the couri-
trv, le oving us in possession of all the substantial
elements of individual happiness and national
greatness He saw nothing in the present crisis to
> pioduce despondency, but nuch to animate our
hopes, in look ng 'h oug \ the perspective of Ihe
fitirt JNo eoun rv en rati ht bilrvcd, pos-

a veiy short period, but could not be a rested by
the  causes now opera tug
He could not admit that the country was
si ibsolutely depet dent on banks for its pros-
perity, as was supposed by some As a
c tizen oí this Republic, he should feel humi-
liated to make such an admission The true
sources ot its prospen y are to be found in
the enterprise and industry of our citizens, m
the i ícvhaustibl  natural resouicis m which it
abounds, and in our 'ree Government, which, by
protecting each citizen in th  enjavment of the
fruits ot his laboi, quickens ente-pnse, and invigo-
rates exertion Notwithstanding these \iews, ho
was hovvevc-, far liona eith i expecting or wishing
the aoohtion of the paper system, the most that
could be effected, was to subject it to salutary re-
strictions, by lessening its capacity to do mischief,
and to infuse into it a greater proportion of metal-
lic omrency The e conectives could be applied
only by the joint agency ot ti e States and the Gene-
ral Government, wh ch wei  demanded as well by
tne pjbl e \oice, as the best interests of the coun-
trv He repeated, therefore, tnat he saw nothing
in the condition ofthe country to inspire alarm, no-
thing that tne pnl' c virtue an 1 intelltgence were
n< t fui ,y abi o meet, and in a hort time to over-
eo aae rorthis, we bad the 1 est guaranty in the
