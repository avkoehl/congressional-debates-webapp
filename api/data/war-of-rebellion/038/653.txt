JACKSON, March 4, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston, Chattanooga, Tenn.:

I think it advisable that General Chalmer be directed to report to me for purpose indicated in previous telegram.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, March 4, 1863.

Major-General STEVENSON, Vicksburg:

Arcadia and Hartford City have been ordered to Vicksburg. You must make your quartermaster and commissaries exert themselves on the Yazoo and Sunflower. What is being done in Sunflower and Deer Creek? I am using every exertion to get corn by railroad. The road was only put in order yesterday. Use your rice and peas.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, March 4, 1863.

Major-General STEVENSON, Vicksburg:

Following dispatches received:

Lawson reports 2nd instant, Quinby's DIVISION, 5,000, went down river Sunday. Large number stores taken for hospital.

THOS. HENDERSON.

Reliable parties still continue to report the idea of a direct assault by night. This idea is very current.

LLOYD TILGHMAN.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, March 4, 1863.

Brigadier General DANIEL RUGGLES,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs me to say that his instructions are, not that wagons, mules, and negroes, but that cotton in transit to the enemy should be seized and burned as the occasion may require.

Very respectfully, &c.,

J. C. TAYLOR,

Aide-de-Camp.

Vicksburg, March 5, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

The enemy are working day and night on the canal. The chances are they will succeed; if so, our guns here will not all be needed. If we do not occupy Grand Gulf the enemy will, and thus be enabled to invest us. If we do, the passage of the canal will merely give them the means of landing at Warrenton, and force them to give us battle there under disadvantages. I respectfully recommend that at least three or four heavy guns from here be put in position there as soon as possible; that at least two of General [J. S.] Bowen's regiments, with his two 20-pounder Parrotts and field battery, occupy it at once.

C. L. STEVENSON.

CHATTANOOGA, March 5, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Yours of yesterday received. Ask Lieutenant-General Smith if he can co-operate with you. Try to get something accurate from Corinth.

J. E. Johnston.
