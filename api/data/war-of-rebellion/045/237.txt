BLOODY RUN, June 20, 1863.

Major-General COUCH:

Certainly, general, as long as I am in your department it will be my duty and my pleasure to obey your orders strictly. I have ordered the Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry to McConnellsburg, as they are acquainted with the country, and kept the First New York to picket the various roads south from this. Regret that the report of the rebels being at Flint Stone is confirmed beyond a doubt.

R. H. MILROY,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., June 20, 1863-1. 50 p. m.

Major-General SCHENCK, Baltimore, Md.:

Major-General Milroy will be placed in arrest, and the members of his staff sent to Harper's Ferry, to report to General Tyler.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

Baltimore, MD., June 20, 1863.

(Received 4. 10 p. m.)

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Your order as to General Milroy will be obeyed as soon as practicable. I relieved him of command at Harper's Ferry, and ordered him to report here. I then sent him back to Harper's Ferry, to assist in collecting and reorganizing those of his troops who were to serve under General Tyler. The railroad communication being interrupted, he had to return from Monocacy. In the meantime, I heard of a large body of his men, who, having turned up in their retreat at Hancock, had gone up into Pennsylvania. I ordered him to proceed by harrisburg to Bedford, to find and take charge of them. He went with his staff, and, at last accounts, was in command of that portion of his division, about 1, 800 infantry and cavalry, at Bedford, or Bloody Run.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.

BALTIMORE, June 20, 1863-4. 30 p. m.

Major-General COUCH, Harrisburg, Pa.:

Where is General Milroy, and how engaged? I will comply with request to order him only through your headquarters. But General Halleck has directed that he be placed in arrest, and the members of his staff sent to Harper's Ferry. Let me hear from you.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
