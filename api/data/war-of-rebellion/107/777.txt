UPTON'S HILL, September 2, 1862.

General WILILAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Surgeon Hutchinson, Twenty-second New York, from Centerville, reports himself taken prisoner, with his wounded, and released this morning. He says Jackson's command was last night near Flint Hill, north of Fairfax Court-House, but he thinks, from what he overheard, that the main part of the rebel force is pushing for the Potomac. I have ordered him to report in person at General Halleck's headquarters or yours, if at Washington. My outpost at Bancroft's Mill, on Columbia pike, has report of a dash last night at a wagon train near Fairfax, and of repulse of enemy in the attack. I am carefully picketing and scouting the country from Bancroft's Mill through Mill's Cross-Roads, Freedom Hill, &amp;c.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
