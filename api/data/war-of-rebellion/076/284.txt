HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,July 28, 1864 - 3.30 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

I have very little hope of being able to carry any point of the enemy's works, since I can't go beyond the strong defenses of Atlanta. I will however, move a considerable force well to my left, make some display and press strongly so as to draw off as much force from your front as possible.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Major-General STANLEY:

Should you discover that the enemy attempts to withdraw any of his forces from your front, I wish you to take advantage of it to drive him as far as possible. See General Schofield's dispatch within.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have kept up my demonstration during the day, and extended it about a mile beyond the railroad. The enemy has continually moved troops to his right, and met me in strong works with a good deal of artillery, and men enough to resist an assault.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., July 28, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

One of my aides is just in from General Howard. He repulsed all attacks handsomely, the enemy leaving his dead in our possession. The number, though heavy, not yet ascertained. Our loss light, the men having temporary barricades.

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., July 28, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

I have your two dispatches. I hardly expected you could carry the enemy's works, but the attack on General Howard was is persistent that I did not know but that Hood had actually stripped his line of all but the militia. Up to the time of my leaving the field no figures
