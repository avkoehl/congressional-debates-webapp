Indiana, will be regarded as before the Senate

tion is on the amendment reported by the
Committee on Commerce.
The amendment was agreed to.

ed, and the amendment was concurred in. The

consular system.
Mr. CHANDLER. I now ask the Senate to
proceed to the consideration of Senate bill No.
472.
The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole-,
proceeded to consider the biil (S. No. 472) to
amend an act entitled " An act to regulate the
diplomatic and consular systems of the United
States," passed August 18, 1856, andforother
purposes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Com-
mittee on Commerce have made several amend-
ments to this bill, and if there be no objection
the amendments of the committee will be con-
sidered as they are reached in the reading of
the bill.
The Chief Clerk proceeded to read the bill.
The first amendment of the committee was
in section one, line ten, to make the salary of
the consul general at London ยง7,000 instead of
$6,000, as fixed in the bill. *โข
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was in section one,
line fifteen, in the consulates general f'orBrit-
ish North America, to strike out " Ottawa,
$2,500."
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was on page 2, line
seventeen, to fix the salary of the consul gen-
eral at Paris at $7,000 instead of $6,000.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was on page 2, in the
list of consulates general, to strike out lines
thirty-four, thirty-five, and thirty-six, as fol-
lows :
Danish Dominions:
Copenhagen, $2,000; St. Thomas, $2,000.
Mr. MORTON. Before the question is put
on any more of the amendments of the com-
mittee, I want to hear the rest of the bill read
through.
Mr. SPENCER. To save time in the read-
ing of the bill, I think it can be explained in
a very few words. It will be understood that
these amendments are all recommended by
the State Department.
Mr. MORION. What change does this
amendment make in St. Thomas?
Mr. SPENCER. It makes no change in
St. Thomas whatever. I introduced this bill
and in introducing it I was unable to devote to
it that care and time and attention that I should
have done, and by mistake St. Thomas was
put in as a consulate general. The State
Department recommended that it be stricken
out as a consulate general and made simply a
consulate, and so it is put in again on another
page of the bill. These amendments which
are now made are in reality not changes. They
are simply taking certain places from the
schedule, of consulates general and placing
them in the' schedule of consulates.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Sen-
ator from Indiana desires it, the reading of
the biil will be proceeded with.
The Chief Clerk resumed and concluded the
..'.acting of the bill.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I desire to
t sK the chairman of the Committee or. Com-
merce to allow this bill to be laid aside inform-
ally until the Senator from New Hampshire,
[Mr. Patterson",] who has given the subject
Considerable attention, and who is unavoidably
absent, shall be present.
Mr. CHANDLER. Very well; let it be
laid aside informally.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be
no objection, the bill will be laid aside.
discoverers of guano.
Mr. CHANDLER. Now I ask the Senate
to Jiroceed to the consideration of House bill
No. 166.
The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole,
proceeded to consider the bill (H. R. No. 166)
to amend an actentitled " Anact to authorize
protection to be given to citizens of the United
States who may discover deposits of guano,"
approved August 18, 1856. The bill proposes
to extend the provisions of the act of Congress
approved August 18, 1856, entitled "An act
to authorize protection to be given to citizens
of the United States who may discover depos-
its of guano," to the widow, heirs, executors,
or administrators of such discoverer, where
such discoverer shall have died before per-
fecting proof of discovery or fully complying
with the provisions of that act after complying
with the requirements of the act of Congress
of August 18, 1865; but nothing herein con-
tained is to be held to impair any rights of
discovery or any assignment by a discoverer
heretofore recognized by the Government of
the United States. The second section of the
bill proposes to amend section three of an act
approved July 28,1866, entitled "An act to
protect the revenue, and for other purposes,"
amendatory of the act approved August 18,
1856. by striking out the word "five" where
ever the same occurs, and inserting in lieu
thereof the word "ten."
Mr. ANTHONY. I do not object to the
amendment proposed to be made to the second
section of that bill, for I do not know what it
is ; but it is a horrible way to legislate. Here
is a bill proposing to strike a word out of the
third section of a certain bill named by its title
and insert a certain other word. How is any-
body to know what the law is? I think that
the section to be amended should be repeated
in the new law.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. This bill is in
Committee of the Whole, and open to amend-
ment.
Mr. ANTHONY. I call the attention of
the chairman of the committee to the fact. I
do not know what the law is, and I shall not
move an amendment; but here is a bill that
proposes to modify a certain section of a pre-
vious law by striking out a certain word and
putting in another word wherever it occurs.
If we want the people to understand the laws
by which tbey are to be governed, how can
they understand such a law as that? I sug-
gest that the section which is proposed to be
amended should be repeated in the new bill.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the
Senator from Rhode Island propose an amend-
ment ?
Mr. ANTHONY. No, sir.
Mr. CHANDLER. Let the bill be laid aside
informally for the present.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will
be laid aside.
steamship service in the gulp of mexico.
Mr. CHANDLER. I now ask the Senate to
take up for consideration Senate bill No. 57.
The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole,
proceeded to consider the bill (S. No. 57)
authorizing mail steamship service in the Gulf
of Mexico between the port of New Orleans,
Louisiana, and certain ports of the republic of
Mexico. The bill proposes to direct the Post-
master General to advertise for proposals and
authorizes him to contract with such American
citizens as may offer to perform the service on
terms most advantageous and least expensive
to the Government for the conveyance of the
mails from and to the United States, and to
and from the republic of Mexico, in the fol-
lowing manner, to wit: the service shall be
a semi-monthly service, and in accordance
with a schedule of departures and arrivals,
to be fixed by the Postmaster General; one
steamer shall leave the port of New Orleans
each month, touching at the ports of Galves-
ton, (Texas,) Tampico, Vera Cruz, Coatza-
coalco, Tabasco, Laguna, Campeche, Sisal,
and thence via Havana to New Orleans; one
other steamer shall leave the port of New
Orleans each month, touching at Havana,
Sisal, Campeche, Laguna, Tabasco, Coatza-
coalco, Vera Cruz, Tampico, and thence, by
way of Galveston, Texas, to New Orleans.
For the performance of this service the con-
tractors are to construct, within eighteen cal-
endar months from the date of the contract,
and place on the line, in condition for actual
service, not less than three first-class sea-going
iron steamships, which steamships shall have
been wholly constructed in the United States,
and after approved models, and all modern
improvements adapted to sea going steamships
of the first class, of not less than fifteen hun-
dred tons burden, and are to be subject to the
approval and acceptance or rejection by the
Postmaster General after an inspection and
survey by a naval constructor, to be detailed
for that purpose by the Secretary of the Navy
upon the request of the Postmaster General,
whose report is to be made to the Postmaster
General; but the Government of the United
States is to have the right to take the steam-
ships for its own use in time of war or threat-
ened danger, either by direct purchase or pay-
ing a sum of money equivalent to a fair interest
on the ascertained value, and for wear and
tear the ships may sustain while in the posses-
sion of the Government; the compensation in
either case to be determined by three sworn
appraisers, one to be selected by the Secretary
of the Navy, otic to be selected by the con-
tractors, and a third to be selected by the two
former, the price so paid in no case to exceed
the original cost of the vessel.
The Postmaster General and the other
named parties to the contract are authorized
to make such changes, adding to or leaving
out such Mexican ports as the interest of the
Post Office Department and the general inter-
course of the two countries may require ; but
the Postmaster General is authorized to pay
to the contractors a reasonable compensation
for the first eighteen calendar months for any
suitable vessel or vessels as may be placed as
pioneers on the route prior to the commence-
ment of the contract service provided for.
This contract is to be for a period not ex-
ceeding ten years, and is not to involve upon
the part of the Government of the United
States an expenditure exceeding $150,000 per
annum.
Mr. BLAIR. Will an objection carry that
bill over?
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Pome-
boy.) The bill is before the Senate by a
unanimous agreement that bills from the Com-
mittee on Commerce should be considered
to-day. The bill is regularly before the Sen-
ate, and is not being proceeded with by unan-
imous consent.
Mr. BLATR. It is a very important bill,
and I should dislike to see a bill of that kind
passed now.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is open
to amendment or discussion.
Mr. BLAIR. I move that the bill lie on
the table.
Mr. CHANDLER. I would ask 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Themotion
is not debatable.
Mr. KELLOGG. I hope the bill will not
be laid on the table.
Mr. BLAIR. It the Senator from Michigan
wishes to discuss the bill, I will withdraw the
motion.
Mr. CHANDLER. No; I was only going to
ask that it go over and not be laid on the table.
Ihe PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
tion is on the motion to lay on the table.
Mr. STEVENSON. Let us have the yeas
and nays.
