THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 23,
Mr. BURNETT. I do not intend to occupy
the time of the House but for a moment or two.
The reason why I objected to a personal expla-
nation by the gentleman from New York was,
that I well understood what was to follow-it. I
aiti opposed to gentlemen bringing their personal
difficulties upon the floor of this House. If a man
denounces me as a slahderer, and charges that. I
have traduced his character, I know how to meet
that sort of charge; I will never seek to stab him
iridirectly. I will meet him face to face, to settle
it as all such questions ought to be settled by hon-
orable men.
I knew this thing was to come up under the guise
of a privileged question. I_knew that an effort
was to be made, under the pretense of a question
of privilege, to raise a committee to investigate a
charge made against a member of this body, who,
in a private letter, addressed to the member from
New York, told him: " Sir, the charge you made
on last Friday is false and slanderous in its char-
acter, and I hold myself responsible for what I
say." The gentleman who wrote that letter is
absent. The gentleman from New York, instead
of responding to the letter addressed to him as an
individual,as it should have been replied to, brings
it into this House; and, without any action on the
part of the gentleman from Ohio, and without his
consent, makes it public. It was a private letter
to the gentleman from New York, who made the
charge, declaring that that charge was false and
slanderous, and that for so branding it the writer
was responsible. Instead of responding to that
letter, the gentleman from New York comes here
and spreads it upon the record, and makes it a part
and parcel of our proceedings. Then, he claims
the right to make a personal explanation to meet
that private letter. I am always ready to give
every man a fair and full opportunity to vindicate
himself from charges of a public character. I will
never hesitate, by my vote, to vindicate the char-
acter and reputation of any member upon this
floor; but I will never permit any man, by my
vote, to raise a committee, without good cause,
to blast and ruin the character and reputation_of
one of my peers.
In the response read by the gentleman from
New York to this House, what is the charge ?
The charge is, that in a private conversation with
some honorable member upon this*floor, (I do not
know who,) the gentleman from Ohio admitted
that he was to have the control of some executive
appointments. Admit that the member under-
stood the member from Ohio to make such an ad-
mission: it is a well known rule of law that such
testimony is of the weakest character. In what
can it result? Here stands the assertion of one
member upon one side, who is entitled to credit,
that the charge is false and slanderous; and on
the other, the gentleman' from New York does
not take the responsibility of saying that he has
any knowledge of the fact charged. He does not
come here and say that he knows this man to be
guilty of these things, and for that reason de-
mands an investigation. No, sir; he says no such
thing; but he becomes the accuser. So long as
I have a seat upon this floor I will never give any
aid or countenance to such a system of warfare
against any man.
This much I wanted to say in vindication of my
position in objecting to the personal explanation
of the gentleman from New York. I did not
want these private matters between the gentlemen
brought here. I knew that it was not with the
consent of the gentleman from Ohio that it was
done. In fulfillment of my promise to the gentle-
man from New York, I renew the motion that the
House adjourn.
The motion was agreed to; and thereupon (at
ten minutes after four o'clock, p. m.) the House
adjourned until Tuesday next.

INDIANA YEARLY MEETING OF FRIENDS.
Mr. PUGH. On Friday, on the motion of the
Senator from New York, [Mr. Seward,] Senate
bill No. 46 was laid on the table, instead of being
postponed. I move that it be taken up, and re-
stored to its proper place on the Private Calendar,
simply that it may not lose its chance. I sup-
pose the Senator intended to move to postpone it
until the next private bill day. It is a bill to grant
the right of preemption in certain lands to the In-
diana Yearly Meeting of Friends.
The motion to take up the bill was agreed to;
and its farther consideration was postponed until
to-morrow.
LAKE PEPIN RESERVATION.
On motion of Mr. STUART, the bill (S. No. 82)
to amend an act entitled "An act to authorize the
j President of the United States to cause to be sur-
! veyed the tract of land in the Territory of Min-
| nesota belonging to the half-breeds or mixed
i bloods of the Dacotah or Sioux nation of Indians,
| and for other purposes," approved July 17,1854,
was read a second time, and considered as in Com-
mittee of the Whole.
It proposes to amend the act of July 17,1854,
so that the body of land known as the half-breed
tract, lying on the west side of Lake Pepin and
the Mississippi river, in the Territory of Minne-
sota, and which is authorized to be surveyed by
that act, shall be subject to the operation of the
laws regulating the sale and disposition of the pub-
lic lands, with a proviso thai when any of these
lands are claimed by preemption, under settle-
ment and cultivation, heretofore made, proof and
payment shall be made within three months after
the passage of the act; and when any of the lands
come within the provisions of the act of 23d May,
1844, " for the relief of citizens of towns upon
lands of the United States, under certain circum-
stances," such proof and payment shall be made
within three months after the passage of the act;
and, in either case, if the entries are not made at
! that time, the claim shall be forfeited.
I The provisions of this law are not to extend to
I any tract or subdivision which may have been
i settled upon, in good faith, by, and is in the oc-
! cupancy of, any of the half-breeds or mixed
i bloods, which lands, so settled upon and occu-
I pied by the half-breeds, are expressly declared to
| be subject to no other disposition than location by
i the "certificates" or "scrip" authorized to be
issued by the act of 1854, for the benefit of these
Indians.
Mr. STUART. I am instructed by the commit-
tee to offer two or throe small amendments. The
first is in line fourteen, to strike out " three" and
insert " twelve" so that it will read, " proof and
payment shall be made within twelve months."
Then, in line two of the second section, I move
to strike out the word " law" and insert " act."
I also move to add at the end of the second sec-
tion the following:
Nor shall the provisions of this act extend to any lands
located prior to its passage on half-breed scrip, without the
consent of the settler or settieis thereon.
The amendments were agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate as amended,
and the amendments made as in Committee of the
Whole were concurred in. The bill was ordered
t^be engrossed and read a third time. It was read
the third time, and passed.
LIABILITY OP SHIP-OWNERS.
Mr. STUART. I ask the Senate to take up
. another bill of an important character, reported
from the Committee on Commerce. It is the bill
S. No. 77.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate, as
in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill (S. No. 77) to amend an act entitled
" An act to limit the liability of ship-owners and
j for other purposes," approved March 3, 1851.
! Its object is to declare that the provisions of the
! "act to'iimit the liability of ship-owners, and for
I other purposes," approved March 3, 1851, shall
| be applicable to the owner or owners of steam-
i boats, sail vessels, and propellers used in the nav-
