The division remained in Petersburg guarding the railroad two days, when by orders from corps headquarters we moved up to Sutherland's Station, on South Side Railroad, and connecting there with the Third Division moved up along the railroad as the army advanced, until the 9th of April, when we stretched from Sutherland's to Wellville.

For details of operations of the respective regiments of the division I respectfully refer you to accompanying reports of the brigade commanders, and commend their notice of gallant officers and men to the approval of the major-general commanding the corps for brevet appointments.

Accompanying the Second Brigade report is the document of the city authorities surrendering the city of Petersburg to Colonel Ely.*
