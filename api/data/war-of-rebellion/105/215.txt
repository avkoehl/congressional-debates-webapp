The route thus far has been very good, and grass and water for animals abundant. No casualties. The health of the command is excellent and the troops in fine spirits.

HEADQUARTERS FIRST CAVALRY OREGON VOLUNTEERS,Camp Numbers 11, on Little Salmon River, June 25, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to report that my command arrived at above-named camp this day in good health and condition. The road thus far has been very good for a mountain road, with an abundance of wood, water, and grass, and with the exception of one or two places is perhaps as good a trail as could be expected in so broken an dmountainous a country. Unfortunately two mules were precipitated down the side of the mountain to-day and killed. Their cargoes were saved. No other casualties have occurred. The distance to this point from Fort Lapwai is something over 100 miles, and the general course about south, or perhaps a trifle east of south. We are supposed to be about 145 miles from Bannock City or Placerville.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. F. MAURY,

Colonel, Commanding.
