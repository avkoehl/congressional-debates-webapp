No. 314. Reports of Colonel E. P. Alexander, C. S. Artillery, commanding Artillery Battalion, First Army Corps, and Acting Chief of Artillery, Second Corps.

MAY 23, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations my battalion in the recent engagements on the Rappahannock:

Marching from Carmel Church, Caroline County, at 1 p.m. on the 29th ultimo, we reached the Plank road at its intersection with the Mine road at 10 a.m. on the 30th. Captain [Tyle C.] Jordan's battery was here put into position, an attack being threatened, and the rest of the battalion held in reserve near by.

On the morning of the 1st instant, Lieutenant [J. Thompson] Brown [jr.], within his section of [William W.] Parker's battery, was sent to man two 10-pounder Parrotts assigned to Parker from [A. B.] Rhett's battery (then detached from the battalion). These guns, by order of General Lee, were left in position on Marye's Hill, under Lieutenant Brown. About 1 p.m. the general advance toward Chancellorsville commenced. Captain Jordan's battery, detached, was sent with the advance infantry on the turnpike. The rest of the battalion - comprising [George V.] Moody with four guns, [Pichegru] Woolfolk [jr.] with four guns, Parker with two guns, and Lieutenant [O. B.] Taylor with four guns - moved at the head of the infantry column under General Jackson on
