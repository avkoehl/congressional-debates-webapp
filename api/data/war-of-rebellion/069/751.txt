HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,June 11, 1864-6.30 p. m.

Major-General, Commanding Army of the Potomac:

My attention has just been called to a latter written by Mr. Swinton, correspondent of the New York Times, and now a follower of this army. The paragraph market with pencil in the inclosed paper* is plainly a libel upon the Ninth Corps, as well as upon myself. He speaks of some dispatches which had been received from me during the morning, which would indicate that he had learned their contents from the telegraph operator or otherwise. The official reports show a loss from two small division of this corps of over 1,000 men during the assault, and the divisions established themselves close upon the main line of the enemy, ready for another assault. I beg that this man immediately receive the justice which was so justly out to another libeller of the press a day or two since. or that I be allowed to arrest and punish him myself. This is not his first offense.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,June 11, 1864.

General SETH WILLIAMS, Assistant Adjutant-General:

Your dispatch in reference to regular troops is received, and the troops will be sent to the Fifth Corps to-morrow morning, if you will inform me where they will find them. Please say to the commanding general that I am very sorry that he has found it necessary to take away from this corps some of its best troops upon the eve of an important movent, a portion of which forms the provost guard of the corps, which is so necessary in a march. I have now fewer men present for duty by several thousand than any other corps in the army.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
