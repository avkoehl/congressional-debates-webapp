THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 3.
or unable to attend to his duties, and yet no court-
martial could be called to try him. It became ne-
cessary, therefore, to suspend the act, so that a
colonel, or any officer, might be brought to a
speedy trial before a court-iYiartic.il. It was not
proposed to repeal the act of 1830, as was sug-
gested by the Secretary of "War, but only to sus-
pend it.   _
Mr. DARRAGH resumed, and commented at
length upon the injustice of the Government in
â€¢withholding proper provision for the common sol-
diers of our army, while the officers, who had
graduated at West Point, were the subjects of such
continual laudation. He would at the proper time
offer a resolution upon this subject.
Mr. BlUiNKKIUlOFf'1 said sufficient time was
not allowed to him to speak directly to all the ob-
jects of the bill, and that the objections to it had
been already fully answeied. In regard to the ob-
jections tu the fifth section, he argued that h con-
tained no provision infringing upon the rights of
the States. The provisions proposed referred to
the standing army of the United States, and the
President, therefore, had the right to appoint the
officers. The objections, therefore, fell to the
ground. These officers must be responsible to the
Government of the United States, because they
have the use of its funds. There was an errone-
ous impression prevailing, he feared, in regard to
the first section. There was now but one major
general and two brigadier generals, Gaines and
Wool. It was the wish of the people that Gen-
eral Taylor should be kept in the field, and that he
should not be superseded in his command. Gen-
eral Gaines had rendered distinguished services, but
his age now disqualified him for active service.
There was at the present time only one brigadier
general of the line whose services could be com-
manded. The bill asked nothing but the addition
of two major generals and four brigadier generals.
The life of General Taylor could not be insuied
to ns; and if so, the army might be divided, and
while General Taylor commanded one army, some
other general must command another.
The hour of two having arrived, the committee
proceeded to vote.
And the first section being under consideration,
in the words following:
" Be it enacted, Sfc.., That the President of the
United States be, and he hereby is, authorized to
appoint, by and with ihc advice and consent of
the Senate, two major generals and four bugadier
generals, in addition to the present mihuuy estab-
lishment/'
Mr. G. DAVIS moved the following, to take
precedence of it:
" That all volunteers that maybe mustered into
the service of the United States under this act, or
the act to which it is supplemental, shall be held
and deemed, m all respects whatever, as militia of
the States Jn the srrvtcc of the United States."
Mr. McCLF.RNAND sent to the Clerk's table a

tia as the service, in his opinion, may require, and
to organize into brigades and divisions the forces

tion."
Mr. JOSEPH .T. McDOWELL moved to amend
it, by adding the following: .
" Provided, That in no case where there are in
any State two regiments organized, and ready to
enter the service of the United States, shall the
