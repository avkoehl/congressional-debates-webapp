The Tariff—Mr. Kerr.
42d Cong....2d Sess.
the domestic kinds diversifies productions in
cloths, increases demand and consumption,
improves quality, and benefits all the people.
But the duty on wool, as well as the duty
on the fabrics of wool, constantly enhances
the prices of the manufactured products to
the consumers. The farmers gain nothing in
the price of their wools, and lose continually
in the increased cost of the fabrics they con-
sume. The fact that prices may be lower in
one period under protection than in a former
period under free trade or less protection
proves nothing for the protectionists. The
value of such a fact will be justly appreciated
when the cause of it is understood. Protec-
tion is desired by people who want their prices
increased. Otherwise they would not want
protection—it would injure them. The
general tendency of mechanism throughout
the world is towards cheaper processes of
production. When these cheap processes are '
left 10 work out their results under unre-
strained competition, then the highest advan-
tages accrue to the people, the lowest prices,
the greatest economy, and in all respects
the greatest benefits.
Iu modern times the division of labor is
carried to a great extent in all leading pursuits,
and thence result greater dexterity, skill, and
effectiveness, and much economy in time.
Then human invention is constantly devising
new, economical, and wisely adapted ma-
chinery for the abridgment of labor. These
and like causes, not protection, reduce the
cost of production and lower prices. I learn
from the "report on the statistics of labor,
1871,'' for Massachusetts, that a man can now
produce on the tame number of spindles
twice as many pounds of yarn as he could
twenty-five years ago; and while a girl, twenty-
five j ears ago. could dre^s 960 yai ds per day, a
man now wuh a slasher will dress from 10,800
to 13.000 yards per day ot' ten hours; and a
gin can now weave three times the number of
yards of cloth a day that she could twenty-five
years ago. So it is m other pursuits, and
notably so in the production of Bessemer
steel. But the people, the consumers and
tax payers of this country, are robbed of most
of the advantages which should result to them
from these great improvements. They are
swallowed up in tribute to the protectionists.
Kobert J. Walker, then Secretary of the
Treasury, in iiis great report, of December 3,
184o, uttered a pregnant truth when he said:
"A protective tariff is a question regarding the
enhancement of the profits of capital, aid not the
augmentation of tne wagesol labor. It iaaqueation
of percentage, and is to decide whether money vest-
ed m our mauuiactures shall, by special legislation,
yield a profit of ten, twenty or thirty per cent., or
whether it shall remain satisfied with dividends
equal to those accruing from the same capital in-
vested in agriculture, commerce, or navigation."
The products of agriculture in the country
at large cannot be otherwise than injuriously
affected by tariffs. This has been the uniform
experience of our country. It was the ex-
perience of Great Britain, now admitted by
all her statesmen and economic writers.
Give agriculture absolute freedom from Gov-
ernment interference, with moderate taxa-
tion for revenue alone, and its prosperity
will be certain, speedy, and permanent. But
protective tariffs discriminate against it and
m favor of manufactures. It is compelled
to pay them tribute to swell their generous
profits and diminish its own moderate earnings.
The commodities they consume are con-
stantly aggravated in price by the tariff, and
their own products of the soil are made to
cost them very much more than they should ;
and they are thus left at the mercy of the
favored manufacturers, who, by the gross and
criminal partiality of the Government, are
enabled to dictate prices, to monopolize the
markets, to keep out competition, and by
enhancement of the cost of production to
make successful foreign commerce impossible.
By the increased cost of production in our
country, caused chiefly by the tariff, but in
part also by our depreciated currency, we are
always at a disadvantage in all the great
markets of other countries. Thus the pro-
tected few in this country are able to regulate
directly the prices the people shall pay them
for their manufactured products, and indirectly
to exclude the farmers and other producers
of values from the markets of the world. Mr.
Walker, in the same report, pertinently says :
" It seems strange that while the profitof agricul-
ture varies from one to eight per cent., that of man-
ufactures is more than double. The reason is that
while the high duties secure readily a monopoly of
the home market to the manufacturer, the farmer
and planter are deprived to a great extent of the
foreign market by these duties. The farmer and
planter are to a great extent forbidden to buy in
the foreign market, and confined to the domestic
articles, enhanced in price by the duties. The tariff
is thus a double benefit to the manufacturer and
a double loss to the farmer and planter."
It is sad to reflect that so many farmers,
good, sensible, and patriotic men, refuse to
understand how extensively they are plundered
by protective tariffs. The prices of their pro-
ductions in the market are never permanently
and advantageously affected by tariffs. I am
here tempted, for illustration, to give a tabu-
lar statement of prices in New York of lead-
ing products of the farm in 1860 and in 1870,
compiled from most reliable sources:

Thus it appears lhat in the transition from
a compai utive revenue tariff, in 1860, to a
grossly protective tariff, in 1870, the whole-
sale prices of the farmer's chief productions,
in the largest market of the country, fell iu
different percentages, averaging from four to
thirty-six, and that very few articles increased
in value. This is the experience of our
country, and of every country that ever tried
protection. But the direct and inevitable
effect of protective tariffs is to increase the
cost and the prices of all manufactured pro-
ducts which the farmers and all the people are
compelled to use. It follows, therefore, that
the farmer is plundered both when he sells his
own produce and when he buys the manufac-
tured products of the protectionists.
The last census showed that the value in
1870 of all the implements and machinery
used in agriculture by the people was $330,-
878,429. At least one third of the cost of all
these is due alone to the tariff, and is loss
without any equivalent to the agriculturists.
In the same year the estimated value of all
farm productions, including betterments and
additions to stock, was $2,447,538,658. The
cost to the farmers of producing ail these
things was aggravated by the tariff at least
thirty per cent, beyond what it would have
been under any honest system of taxation for
revenue alone. Mr. Edward Atkinson, in
his exceedingly instructive paper on " The Vis-
ible and the Invisible in Protection," has
shown that the total product of the dairy in
cheese, butter, and milk in 1870 exceeded in
value $540,000,000. Yet all these mighty
interests are unprotected. They cannot be
beneficially protected.
For these great evils and wrongs there is
but one effective remedy in the power of the
Government, and that is in a prompt and hon-
est return to a tariff for revenue alone. This
is also the wise, statesmanlike, and logical
conclusion of Mr. Walker. He says:
" The constitutional power of Congress to lay and
collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises does not
authorize the laying of a prohibitory duty or a duty
in which revenue is sacrificed to the object of pro-
tecting the manufacture of the commodity taxed."
* * * * "A direct tax or excise, not for
revenue, but for protection, clearly would not be
within the legitimate object of taxation; and yet it
would be as much so as a duty imposed for a similar
purpose."
Impose a direct tax of three cents a pound
on all hemp raised in our country except in
Kentucky, and none on hemp raised there.
That would be a protective excise tax—pro-
tective of Kentucky. Or impose a like tax
of twenty cents per pound on all tobacco not
raised in Virginia, and no tax on Virginia
tobacco. That would protect Virginia. Or a
tax of one dollar each on all wool hats, and
two dollars each on all woolen blankets made
elsewhere and sold in Indiana, and no tax on
like articles both made and sold in Indiana.
Such a tax would protect the manufacturers of
such articles in Indiana. How long would
American citizens outside of the favored States
submit to such protective internal taxation ?
The fabric of our institutions would soon be
made to tremble to its foundations under the
strong hand of popular indignation, if such a
discrimination were attempted. But how does
it differ in effector principle from a protective
duty imposed on all imported steel or iron,
on fabrics of wool or cotton, or on copper or
lumber? These duties are imposed in the
interests of a few persons engaged in the pro-
duction of those things in several sections of
the country. The sole object of the protec-
tion is to enable them to compel all consum-
ers of their products to pay them more for
them than they are worth in other markets,
and to prohibit the consumers from going to
those other markets for them. That is what
protection means.
Shall America alone cling to the restrictive
policy of the past when all other nations are
adopting the wiser and better principles of
free exchange ? Shall we deny to our citi-
zens the God-given inheritance of personal
liberty? Shall my Government barter my
liberty to my neighbor for his gain, by pro-
