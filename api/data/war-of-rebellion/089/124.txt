HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,October 8, 1864 - 8.50 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

General Parke sends word that his line is advancing on the left. My own line is pushing out, but its right is so close to the enemy's line that they cannot advance over fifty yards without drawing fire from the enemy's works. Our signal officer reports our skirmish line pushed out on the Squirrel Level road and slowly advancing.

Respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,October 8, 1864 - 9.50 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: Our line has advanced on the left nearly a mile in front of our present position. It occupies a line of old works of the enemy. The enemy have a thin line in their works. Their advanced sentinels have been driven from their line of pits on our right of the railroad and the line advanced. The distance is so great that i desire to know if I shall still go toward the enemy's works. Scales' and McGowan's brigades, of Wilcox's division, are in our front.

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

P. S. - The picket-line is well supported by a brigade of each division.

Your dispatch of 9.50 is just received. The object of your movement is not to attack the enemy, but to make him believe that you intend to attack. A supporting force should follow your picket or skirmish line,
