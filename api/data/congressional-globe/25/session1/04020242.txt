This is the great sect el of our superiority, and of
that of ever} free people—not the forms of a con-
stitution, not the outlines of a system, not mere
organiza! on- but the pimciple of life, the all-per-
vading animation and vitality that informs the
whole body politic, and gives it the warmth, and
strength, and aciivit}—the winning graces and ex-
press v e countenance ol a man, instead oi the cold
and repulsive stillness of a painted coipse Juiy-
tnal is anothei of these irreguhnties—liable, un-
doubtedly, to much criticism m detail, scarcely
susceptible, as a judicial institution, of a stnct de-
fence m theon—}et what should we think of a re-
former that should propose to us, the abolition of a
s}stem so full oí practical good, because it was
unkrown until ret ently, an} where but in England,
and often leads, as it certainly has often led, to
great abuse and miustice
But, then, it seems, our banking system is an
innovation, introduced only a century and a half
ago, and devntes fiom the primitive model of the
bank of Amsterdam,—the honest system, as it is
called—and that instead of lending money, it
lends merel} credit
As to the idea ot its being an innovation, I would
j ist remark, that it had its origin at that great
epoih of humm improvement, as I must still be al-
lowed to call it, when mankind ceased to cut each
othei's throats for differences in íeligion, and be-
gan to make war foi colonies and commerce—
an era pcr^ertly familiar, as such, to en\,y one that
hns studied history philosophica h But there is
something more in the histoncal *(miniscence
than the mere fact just leferred to If the com
parmve effects of Dutch and English banking are
to be judged by the event, what an mstructiv e lesion
is to be drawn from a parallel between those two
powers, at the close of the 17ih century, and their
relation towards each other now' Where is Van
Tromp1 Where is de Ruyter'? What is become
of the might} fleets which disputed the dominion
of the seas with England and France? Poor
Holland1 her defenceless ports, blockaded by
Bri ish squadrons—hei court brow beaten by British
dir lomic) —shorn of all her strength and glory, she
seems almost sinking again into the waters out of
which she mergid So much rot the innovation
But whit is the objection to the system1 Let
us understand cch other I will jiut a case The
quantity ot the precious meta's requned in any
ti ansaction, or any number of transacticns, betw een
two countries, (oi two individuals, foi it comes to
the same thing,) depends not only upon the balance
of payments between them, but also in the confi-
dence they have in each other Thus, Hamburgh

whose papei circulat on, of all sorts, is something
like two hundred milu< ns, resting upon a basis of
only thirty millions of specie * Money is nothing-
more than what js cal'ed by the brokers " a bought
and sold note ," it is a token, which shows that its
holdei has parted with commodities to that amount,
and that he is entitled to receive their equivalent
in other commodities, whenever it shall be his
pleasure to do so Why should that token be of
gold1 Why should a mere t tie o" evidence of
debt, be itself of a material as costl} as the thing
of which it is the symbol and the evidence1
It ¡s clear, that were there anv means of insur-
ing society against exc°ssive issues of paper, be-
sides its convertibility into gold and stiver—were
not that the only pr?clical test hitherto discovered,
by which prices m different countries can be com-
pared—all commeicial nationswou'd d spensewith
the precious mt tils as a medium of exchange
But, as }et, there is no such means, and the cur-
rency, theoietically the most perfect, is for tne
present impracticable The ncaiest approxima-
tion to it has certainly been made occasionally in.
the Uni'ed States, wheie the specie basis has just
answered the purpose of ascertaining that our cm-
rency was on a level with that of other nations
But there is anothci step in the commercial ope-
ration just mentioned The helder of the bill of
exchange, received in pajment of com, stands in
need ot some other commodity, which hi  own
cr dit does not enable him to procure He applies
to a broker, or any other capitalist, f< r the cash, < r,
what will answ er his pui pose j list as w ell, his credit,
in the shape of i note payable on demand, or at a
short da'e, for which tl e original bill, at six months,
is given in exchange, with a reisorable discount
This last operation is w hat is considered as the
great abomination of banking The bank receives
a discount on giving i's own bill, pa}able on de-
mand, or one it i shoit date, (foi which, therefore,
it is compelled to reseive or prepare a fund,) for a
bill pa}able at six months, of which, of course,
payment cannot be demanded until the expiration
of that term And now I ask, where is the differ-
ence between the first operation, which every body
must perceive is eminently conducive to the exten-
sion of commerce, and the last1 What objection
can be made to it, that does not he equally against
the draw mg and discounting of bills of exchange,
an improvement of which Europe has been boast-
ing for at least six hundred years, and of which
the advantages have never, to my knowledge, been
questioned before1 Why is not a credit founded
on ptnpeily, as good in the one case as mthe otner1
And why should gold and silvei be used m either,
when the} are not w wted1
The banking system, sir, is only one form of that
division of labor, which takes place m all opulent
countries It leads to a gieat economy, ooth of
